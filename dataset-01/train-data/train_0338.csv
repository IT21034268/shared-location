2,"Sweet movie, but ...","After watching this movie with my family and friends, we've come up with our own verdict that there is no trace of amusement. Even I personally thought about this movie to be funny and culturally interesting, I found it's hard to believe this movie was a big hit when it first came out. Use your own judgement, not some critiques on TV or magazines.Use the Windex !"
2,Cute but Predictable,"This movie tries to hard to be cute and funny. I liked some parts to it and the characters were likeable enough. The father with his Windex for every solution was funny. I just could not get into the whole movie. It's a nice movie, but it's a little predictable. If you want some fluff, this is it for you."
4,Heart-warming blockbuster,"Toula (Nia Vardalos), a thirtysomething Greek American spinster with a very involved extended family, falls in love with Ian (John Corbett), a handsome WASPy high school teacher. This straightforward film tells the story of their courtship and the clash of cultures that ensues when her horrified parents learn that she does not intend to settle down with a nice Greek boy. To its credit, Vardalos's screenplay doesn't go in for any contrived ""boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl"" nonsense. Toula and Ian are clearly in love and I never doubted that they would get married. The central tension of the film is how-not whether-her family will come to terms with it. This film boasts a terrific cast of character actors who get a chance to shine in major roles, particularly Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan as Toula's parents./"
5,A great show!!,I went to see this with a few girlfriends of mine and we ended up being the YOUNGEST in the theater. This movie appeals to most ages and is the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. I would recommend it to anyone old enough to watch it!
5,funny and heartwarming,"We went to see this movie because it was starting at the time we got to the theater. It was a delightful surprise. Hilarious in places and touching throughout. I laughed out loud any number of times, and when the movie was over the crowd applauded.The acting was top-notch and the whole movie had a warm, lively feeling. It was about all the problems one encounters in becoming the individual one wants to be.Anyone who has ever gotten married should see this movie."
5,Everyone will want to be Greek!,"Drove 50 miles to see this movie on the first release weekend and have now seen it 5 times. Never have I ever seen a movie more than once! Worth it, Loved it, Will see it again and buy it on DVD. It was a good clean movie that I dragged my own teenagers to and they loved it-they also walked out understanding a little more about their own Greek family. Looking for a good movie to take a teen to that does not want you to turn away or walk out-this is the one. And you will leave with a smile on your face and a need to buy Windex! Thanks to Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson for showing Hollywood that good, clean movies are a smash hit and ones we want to see!"
3,*yawn*,"After hearing all about this being a 'surprise box office hit' I watched it with high expectations-WAY too high. The beginning was ok. But after she met the man of her dreams, had all these problems about him with her family she just got to marry him. Just like that. After all this fuss. And then you wait some more for the other big problem to come up. And it never comes. She happily marries and has a kid and lets it marry whoever she wants. The End. Well, so much for that."
4,Sweet Romantic Comedy,"The epitome of a sweet romantic comedy that actually makes you laugh out loud. You don't have to be Greek to enjoy this flick. While the premise (ugly duckling becomes beautiful swam & gets Prince Charming)is quite contrived it is also very enjoyable for those of us that are looking for something other than violence and sex in the cinema. The main character, Tula, is played by Nia Vardalos, upon whose one-woman show the film is based upon. WARNING: If you are planning a wedding or have been involved in the planning of a wedding you will laugh till you cry."
5,Haven't laughed that hard in a long time!,"This is an excellent movie. I thought that it would be a ""girlie"" movie, but it wasn't just that. It was a family, comedy, and drama all rolled into one. Incredible story about a Greek family. I learned alot and laughed to the very end. I can't wait for this movie to be released at the stores so I can run out and buy it!"
4,"Funny, Uplifting, a nice change","I found the movie to be very uplifting and funny. It was a nice change to watch something with some humor in it that i'm sure lots of people can relate to in some way. It wasn't your everyday perfectly built, 100 lb. women with silicone breasts film. It must be a hit since it was in theaters for months vs. the norm 2-3 week run. If you haven't watched it yet, rent it!"
2,More like 1 1/2 stars,"This movie is not very good. It received a lot of good word of mouth for some reason but really it stunk. The stars are not appealing at all. The humor is not creative at all. Think of every movie that you see about some ethnic group and they have them all in this movie. I was actually wishing the two main stars would not fall in love because I really didn't like them or care about them. The only funny moment was Grandma sipping on a Miller Lite. Very random! Overall, though, this movie [stinks]!"
1,BIG FAT (GEEK) WEDDING!,"This is the corniest movie I've ever seen! I can't believeanyone on this planet, could like this crap! If The old mantook a bottle of windex, and shoved it up his wazoo, thatwould be funny! (THIS MOVIE BLOWS!)"
2,Bland,A really BLAND film. Contrived and unfunny and bland. Lainie Kazan as the mother was almost certainly cast because she played an almost identical role as the ethnic mother to an embarrassed and Americanized offspring in MY FAVORITE YEAR. See MY FAVORITE YEAR (starring Peter O'Toole) if you want to see what this film SHOULD have been.
1,Boring and banal soap,"There isn't any original idea in this film, it is too boring for a comedy and too predictable for any other genre. It is amazing that films like this are produced - couldn't they do anything more challenging or at least entertaining for the mind for the money they spent on making the film? It doesn't even have a soothing effect of a good laugh becuase it irritaes after 10 min with its pathetic stereotypes and clich√©s. And at the end, the happy end , of course. I felt that Forrest Gump was the director, and indeed it is Tom Hanks's film. Bravo to the extreme banality!"
2,disappointing,There was one thing surprising about this movie: How utterly predictible and formulaic it turned out to be.
1,Not a new romantic classic...,"Why this movie was such a smash hit is beyond me (as well as many others). Maybe there's an overabundance of old ladies out there. I'm sure Nia Vardalos is a funny and wonderful lady, but she uses the most obvious jokes to pick on her Greek family. Her love interest only has two different facial expressions in the movie, which is a higher number than the dimensions of every single character in this nauseating product from the estrogen-dominating Hollywood conveyor belt. After seeing this with my girlfriend, I made it up to her by renting The Philadelphia Story, Shakespeare in Love, and Say Anything... Why quality romances like these can't be monster hits is beyond us."
2,I am worried.,"Most people loved this movie, can anyone tell me why?. This film is a cheesy over the top silly and phony excuse of a movie. If you want to see something better than this but with a similar storyline rent -True Love- with Annabella Sciorra & Ron Eldard. Overall: I AM WORRIED."
3,Are we this starved for decent stories?,Ok - this move was barely 'OK' to me. A few original funny moments (groom's mother's name is written 'Harry' mistakingly in the wedding invitation instead of 'Harriet') and lots of way overblown and over the top ethnic cliches. Haven't we all seen enough of family's that love to hate each other and argue and scream only to say how 'magical' everything really is down deep inside? Oh brother...The only way I can explain the cult-like phenomenon that arose over this movie is that WE are so worn out with the overabundance of action movies whose engine is a spectacular car-chase that we are starved for anything that smacks of just a decent story.To be quite honest with you I think Hollywood and the whole movie industry is in deep doo-doo if this was somehow worthy of all the hype.
1,Big Fat Disappointment,"I had heard so much about this movie and how funny it is, etc., etc. I brought it home the other night and couldn't wait to watch it. BORING! BORING! BORING! I kept waiting for the movie to get going but it didn't. It was really a big disappointment after all the hype."
1,Don't waste your money,"MY wife bought this movie because it was hyped so much. We watched it and, although it had some okay points, it was a total waste of money. There was no real story line or plot, most of the humorous parts were what we have seen in many other films. The acting was not bad, but portraying a stereotype without a good story line left me wishing I had rented this. I would recommend renting this before you buy it....and then make your decision. The other side of this review is that my younger brother and his girlfriend loved.....so....this is one of those ""love it or hate it,"" movies......better than renting it, I'm sure one of your friends got suckered into buying this. You should borrow it and see it before you buy.Peace,Morley"
4,"Great Start For Nia, But Too General of a Plotline","My Big Fat Greek Wedding is about Toula, a misfit girl from a large Greek family who is trying to make something out of her life at the ripe age of thirty. It is a typical romance film; outcast finds love and realizes that she was really loved all along. This is an excellent start for Nia Vardalos, though it was too much of a typical storyline."
2,Could not get into this one,"...Way too much hype...the movie draggggged! And I mean dragggged!!! I lost interest, and stopped watching it!!"
5,Adorable!!,Hilarious and 100% entertaining movie. The plot is clever and the characters are all extremely memorable. There wasn't anything I disliked about this movie. I can't use Windex without smiling and thinking of this terrific funny movie.
4,A delightful light hearted movie,"This movie one that I have perfect if your alive, and have family. Whose family isn't a little weird? All families have their quirks and we love them for it. This one is funny from the begining credits right until the last credits role. Who can't love a story about falling in love, throwing you loved one to the wolves, I mean your family, and then the wedding that is bound to come after."
4,I Put it Off for as Long as I Could!,"I hate succumbing to media pressure but I finally gave in and saw it. Surprise! It was very good. No deep thinking, no philisophical discussions - just an enjoyable comedy that seemed to hit all the right notes. I happen to work with a lot of brides and grooms in my line of work and maybe that is why it appealed to me more. I see events like those depicted in the movie every day and it really was true to what planning for a wedding can be like. Simple story, great characters - simply wonderful!"
5,What a Flick!!!,"This is a great show, and it has an excellent comentary as well. The fact that the movie was still a major theatre here when the DVD was released says a lot about the staying power of the movie. Of the many DVDs that I own, this will be one that I will play many times.This has comedy and romance. I really enjoyed."
5,A winner,"This movie has heart and is very funny, seldom predictable. It is for all generations: my mother, my daughters and my grandson all loved it, too."
2,A Simple Minded Movie,"Describing this movie is real simple. This is the story of a Greek woman who is thirty works for her Greek parents. She is homely. She has a makeover. She is pretty good looking. She falls in love. Mom and dad don't approve of her man because he is not Greek. Mom and Dad finally let their daughter marry the man. They live happily ever after.That really is the story in a nutshell. This movie plays out like a half hour sit com drawn out over an hour and a half. There is no originality. It's a ugly duckling meets the dad doesn't approve of daughters boyfriend movie. Oh, as for the Greek family..if this had been written by a non Greek some anti defamation league would have had a fit. They are all stereotypes. They are obnoxious, they are dull, and they are course. However, they are not funny. This movie was nominated for a best original screenplay award. For Windex jokes? This is a boring movie for boring people. Enjoy."
4,A Feel Good All Over Movie,"This movie is a sleeper. I went along with the crowd to a movie one evening just for something to do. To my surprise and delight, this movie was fantastic. My Big Fat Greek Wedding is unique and so very funny. You smile in the first and last scene of the movie. You belly-laugh in-between. I'm buying this movie for my collection a soon as it is available. Don't miss the fun!!"
5,A Riot,I laughed from the beginning of this movie to the end. I really feel that just about anyone will find something to relate to here!
2,My Big Fat Greek Wedding,Really was disappointed in this film.... silly and over-the-top trying to be funny...... peeeeeyooooou
2,Why Did I Buy It!?!?,"Everyone was saying how funny and wonderful this movie was. Even when I decided to purchase it, the lady at the checkout said ""you'll love it!"" --I hated it!! Ok, hate is too strong. I suggest you rent it. Don't go to the theater--and don't buy it till AFTER you've rented it, or you're wasting your money! Yes, it was 'cute', I guess, if you can get past the fact that it was BORING!!!! This is a SIMPLE movie. Nothing too entertaining here.1smileycat :-)"
5,"A must have ""chick-flick"" movie for your collection!","Grab your favorite flavored tea, some snacks, and the tissues because this movie will have you laughing and crying!Watch as the main character changes from an ugly duckling to a beautiful young, greek woman who falls in love with a man from a different ethnic background. Which her father does not approve of.The supporting cast gets in on the laughs as they try not to steel the show from Nia and John C.If you didn't get to see this movie in the theater, you really need to purchase it now and see for yourself why it was the sleeper hit of 2002!"
5,AWESOME MOVIE,I've seen it twice and can't wait to get the DVD! We laughed all the way through and are still quoting lines from the movie. It is really one of the best movies I have ever seen and I recommend it to everyone.
4,Wonderful movie! I felt like I was looking at my life,"If anyone has ever married into another culture, this movie is your life! I went to see it with my husband and mother-in-law, and we laughed so hard at all the similarities his Cuban family had to the characters in the movie. It was dead on! not stereotypical!Buy this movie!"
3,"Great movie, but wait for the inevitable Special Edition DVD","A warm and very funny movie. Vardalos is fantastic, and the whole cast does a surprisingly good job. ...In three to six months we'll probably see a ""Deluxe 2-DVD Edition"" of the film, and I for one will not be buying this or any other movie twice. Just wait a couple months to release it and put out a fully-packed version. I'm tired of the studios milking fans with multiple editions of DVDs.So, great movie but skimpy DVD. Wait for the inevitable Special Edition..."
3,My Big Fat It's Not All That Wedding,"As the film starts, Toula (the heroine of the film) looks like Mrs Doubtfire's ugly sister but a brief night school computer course sees her transform from the proverbial ugly duckling into...ahem...well she never was going to be an oil painting. Still, a touch of lippy and mascara and a personality transplant to go with it and she gets the hunky but dull Ian to bend over backwards to accommodate her and her family. Yes, and pigs might fly!Why did I think I was watching the TV movie remake of ""Moonstruck""? Exchange overbearing Italian family for overbearing Greek family and BOOM you got My Big Fat Greek Wedding.It's really not a bad film but gawd knows why it got so many plaudits."
2,Somewhat cute...but irritating,"I'm a non-Greek living in Greece. Some of the things in the film that were supposed to be funny...AREN'T when you have to listen to them on an almost daily basis. For example, many Greeks really do believe that their language pre-dates all other languages. It may seem like nothing more than the rantings of an eccentric old man who also believes that Windex is a cure-all. However, this sort of pseudo-scholarship is very common over here, and not at all charming in reality. Maybe a Greek could find it humorous to poke fun at that, but anyone who has been invited to someone's home only to hear a lecture on how their language is ""poor"" compared to Greek...won't find it very amusing."
3,Funny,"Overall this movie is quite funny and well done, but has that Hollywood vibe, whether that is good or bad is your opinion. I liked it, but it's not one of those movies I want to watch more than twice."
3,Pleasantly humorous,"Good, clean fun with nothing offensive, but nothing substantial. Kind of like Windex. Michael Constentine seems to have been missing for years, but steals scenes here. Can't wait to see what Nia has up her sleeve next."
3,Could Have been funnier,"This movie was funny, but not what I expected.You know the story, but the laughs were not that BIG and FAT.The characters were believeable and well acted, but the script could have been better.That whole Windex was extremely not funny, considering the fact the you could get an affection from spraying house hold cleaner on an open wound.i thought there could have been more about the wedding.One of my friends, who happens to be greek, raved about this movie, so I guess I had high expectations, but this movie didn't forfill most of them.I normally love comedys, but this didn't have me rolling with laughter.It's good for a rainy day, but I recommend ""Miss Congeniality"" over it.Sorry if I sound whiny, I normally don't flame reviews because I hate critics, I just feel that it could have been funnier."
2,Big Fat Overrated Wedding,"This movie was beyond overrated and I have no idea why everyone was ranting and raving over it. What is so fascinating about being ""Greek""? They put so much emphasis on the Greek issue it was like they were begging for acceptance or something. Just be proud of who you are. I also think this movie was sending the message that if you marry someone ""non-ethnic"" and blonde and blue eyed that your whole life will magically improve and be complete. Yeah, whatever. None of the dialogue was funny, and in fact, this movie was sincerely boring. Maybe this truely is a ""chic flick"". I don't know of any men that would like this movie and if there is, I would be very surprised. I hope the new TV show based on the movie is more entertaining than this thing!"
3,Not What I Expected,"I should know by now that any movie that has a lot of hype surrounding it usually isn't all that it's cracked up to be. For an 'indie' movie, it was pretty good. I'm not saying that I didn't like this movie, I was just a little disappointed... I thought it would be funnier.Now that I've said that, I really do think that this is a movie to see. Coming from a really small family, it was hilarious to see Toula's huge family consisting of 26 'first' cousins. It is a romantic movie and shows that love does conquer all."
1,"""You'll never go broke underestimating the etcetera...""","As a purported romantic comedy, this unimaginative slog fails on all counts. There's no ""meet-cute"", there's no dramatic conflict, there's isn't even a character arc. What there is, however, is 90 minutes of cheap, weak Greek stereotypes recycled from some justifiably forgotten sitcom. The whole exercise is inoffensive and mild to the point of mild offense. Of your two grandmas, the dimwitted one will love it."
3,Check out the used prices!,"While it's not exactly reinventing the wheel, this is definitely one of the far better romantic comedies I've seen in quite some time.I'm not quite sure I would have sprung twenty bucks to buy it, but CHECK OUT THE USED PRICES!! You can own a copy of this for around six or seven bucks now! That's just a shade more then the cost of a rental! What a great value for your dollar!"
1,My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"This movie was a total disappointment. An idea that could have been charming has been turned into something gross. The grooming details of the bridal party were more than most viewers would care to see in a romantic comedy. Also, the male and female leads aren't believable. He's entirely too attractive for her, even after the makeover. If I were a Greek-American, I would want to sue the producer. This movie really puts it to them. This could have been charming. It was raunchy."
1,Greatly overrated movie,After reading a number of reviews of this movie I ordered it. This movie was a great letdown for me--actually a waste of time viewing it. I plan to resell it.
1,How did this movie get so big?,"This movie is titled a comedy, but I didn't laugh once when I saw it in the theater. As a matter of fact, it is one of only 2 movies I have ever walked out on. The acting was decent, but not great by any means, and after sitting through well over and hour of this movie, I couldn't take any more of it"
1,Big Fat Zero,"This movie, with its racist undertones and social stereotyping is one big fat zero. As for comedy, I and my two friends watching didn't laugh once. How this movie can be described as charming is beyond me. Saddam Hussain has more charm for chrissakes!!The humour is so predictable, the characters so wafer thin, and the plot is non existent.Don't waste your money on this, go spend it on Muriel's wedding instead."
3,It is funny...... Greek style,i reccomend this movie to people who are Greeks and live abroad. I am sure they are gonna have fun with this movie....
1,My Big Fat Stupid Movie,"This movie is neither funny nor clever. This movie takes itself too seriously. It recycles the same stale old jokes could be written about any ethnic group to the same effect. The characters are basic but exaggerated to the point of being to grotesque and unbelievable. The plot line has been done so many times that you can recite it in your sleep. There is nothing new here. If you want to see a clever, edgy movie that is actually funny, see Barbershop."
2,a big fat disappointment,"My tag line pretty much sums it up.I had heard this movie was hysterically funny, and I wasn't laughing much at all.Actually not many people were laughing when I saw this story of an ""ugly duckling"" who comes out of her shell and comes into her own. It's a coming of age, which I can appreciate.Seeing as a Greek person, the star of the film, Nia Vardalos, wrote the screenplay, the portrayals of the Greek family must be right on. Well, I felt saddened by there behavior. I thought since Toula(Nia Vardalos) was coming into her new brave world that she would have put her foot down and had her wedding her way instead of her family's way. They entirely took over everything. It just bothered me to watch her allow this cuz they are ""family"".A big letdown of a movie. Avoid!! It's not funny."
1,Pointless Drivel,"I had heard so many wonderful things about this film and was quite anxious to see it. When I finally did I found it to be rather disapointing. The jokes were inanely obvious and played into tired stereotyping. Perhaps most irritating is that this film really had no plot - a thirtiesh woman meets a thirtiesh man, they have a relationship and get married. The only character development was the father's reluctant acceptance of the young man into the family. Hardly worth watching."
1,It's no Runaway Bride.,"Wellity, wellity, wellity. This is a rare one. A film that I don't like, but everyone else seems to love it. I ask you the question why? If you want to see trash-coms with unknown stars in the lead roles, go watch a play for christ's sake. Don't waste my time with your pretentious wannabe a star-com. I just don't believe in all that love at first sight stuff. I reckon the real way to go about a proper relationship is to impress yo' ho's wit displays of affection. Robbing them a car, or a DVD or some stuff like that. It's like Ryder says, 'if you don't work at a relationship, then the relationship won't work.' And I go along with that.So fine, if you want a trashy no-good, low-down, cheap-laugh, drunken-grandad, mock-a-minute poo com. By all means, buy this DVD. If you are a real person, then don't buy it."
5,the best greek wedding,While sitting in the theatre i watched the people around me as i was laughing so loud. I noticed they were laughing as well and you couldn't help it. I think Nia Varadalos did the movie justice she was very down to earth and then appeared like a butterfly so beautiful yet so gentle in her character. I highly recommend you see this movie and if you are over 40 I encourage it as it is good clean humor. This is what humor was all about years ago.
5,Ooomp-ha!,"What a joy! How nice to attend a movie with no bad language, no nudity and no gratuitous sexual situations. Can't wait for this to be on DVD so I can share it with my 10-year old daughter. Although I didn't grow up greek, I grew up in an ethnic Polish-American home and could really relate to many of Toula's predicaments! Nia Vardalos and John Corbett were outstanding, and Michael Considine and his Windex bottle...well, I wouldn't want to spoil it. Even Joey Fatone was great...he just fit in the background as a cousin and was very natural....This flick had better receive some Oscar nominations!! Get to your local theater FAST or get it on DVD once it comes out! Ooompah!!"
5,Do yourself a favor...,"If you are looking for a movie that is funny and and sweet, then this is the one. I enjoyed the fact that there was no sex or violence, just hilarious and touching moments. I'm not Greek, and I'm not even married, but I could relate to this movie on so many levels. Hollywood should make more films like this!"
4,My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"I really liked this movie. Some of the jokes weren't all that funny, but the overall story line was great. I would recommend this to any one over 16. Anyone under that age might not get the point of much of it."
2,always rent first,"Perhaps I made a mistake in not going to see this movie while it was in theaters. That being said, I took to heart all of the wonderful reviews, the appearence on Oprah and the recommendations of total strangers that this movie was the HIT of the year! I believed in them so well that instead of renting the movie, I went out and purchased it post haste! Big mistake....I'm now watching the movie for the 2nd time in an attempt to marvel in the hysterical comedic perceptions reported to be caused by this movie. I giggled maybe 4 or 5 times and forced a robust outburst one or two times......I'm still waiting and hoping that it will come........and imagine...it's mine to keep....go figure.."
5,Don't miss it!!,"In a world of violence, sex, and gore...finally something that didn't need any of that to be a hit. All the performers cast in this movie were perfect.....I laughed all the way through! I wanted more!"
4,Hilarious Apple & Orange Wedding,"Story is simple but it's fun and loveable. It talks about how an orange meets with an apple and get married together with completely different background and families pressure. Their true love eventually overpower people's stubbornness & cultural beliefs, and coming to a happy ending. This is a great movie that really does give you some excellent and joyful romantic entertainment. If the DVD could come with features like deleted scenes, that will be much better. Overall, a wonderful movie that makes you laugh, happy, romantic, and warm. It's just the DVD lacking abit of extra goodies."
3,Big Fat Greek Hype,I liked this movie but it wasn't as great as the media and public made it out to be. I enjoyed the film and thought the story was cute but it could have been a little better plot.
3,Opa!!!,"The film is funny and great, but you are much better off buying the VHS because the quality is the same, and the DVD has no special features worth seeing, so skip the DVD, but get the VHS!"
2,Overhyped; boring and predictable,"I wanted to like this because of the story behind the movie (Independent movie makes good...). Instead, I watched with growing disbelief that this movie never really got going. Mildly amusing, some good performances, but overall it was a real sleeper. Many other romantic comedies out there are a lot more interesting."
5,an amazing band,"many people have only heard ""kennedy"",it's a great song,but nothing compared to the rest of this cd.each song has it's own ""style"",such as ""lovesick"" and ""sick boy"",great song's,and if you like ""kennedy"",you are guranteed to LOVE this album,give it a try.i usually don't buy cd's,but this cd was worth it."
5,One of the best records I have heard in a while,"Kill Hannah's ""For Never & Ever"" is one of the best records I have heard in a while. Has wonderful songs with meaningful lyrics. ""Unwanted"" is I think the best song because it is pretty much an anthem for everyone who has been unwanted, ignored, ditched because of the way they are. All and all this is a great record, you should pick it up. Trust me, if i can get my friend that has listened to U2 for the past 3 years to listen to it and love it, it must be a really good record lol."
5,Smashing Debut,'Is anyone here alive?' belts Mat Devine lead singer of the Chicago band Kill Hannah. Well are we? I know that I am alive after hearing Kill Hannah's first major label release on Atlantic Records.Dubbed &amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;The hardest working band in Chicago&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; by many critics and fans Kill Hannah live up to their monkier on this album. From start to finish this c.d. is a beautiful mix of influences that creates an absolute auditory buffett that any fan of original rock music will eagerly devor.&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;For Never and Ever&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; are posed to make their mark on the world. They are the beacon of hope in a sea of rock radio sludge. Kill Hannah are the butterfly flapping away across the ocean. Kill Hannah and &amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;For Never and Ever&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; will change the way we listen to music &amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;rom now on&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;.
2,FILLER MUSIC..,"I'm disappointed. I've been at Kill Hannah's shows since they began and I have to say that American Jet Set is much better than For Never and Ever. The sound is always good, but the lyrics are just horrid... maybe a song (two at most) could be called decent/acceptable, but for the most part this seems like it's just an album that will appeal to enough 16 year olds to get their name out. I've stopped going the their shows."
1,somebody kill this band,"this band is like colored toilet paper. it tries to be fashionable but in the end, you just want to wipe your ass with it.do yourself a favor and buy records by yeah yeah yeahs, the locust, tv on the radio, dillenger escape plan, distillers, le tigre, leftover crack, elliott smith,converge, electric six and mindless self indulgence.avoid this like the plague...."
3,WORTH THE MONEY!!,"KILL HANNA DEFINATLY ROCKS!!I LOVE THE SONG ""RAINING ALL THE TIME"",UNWANTED AND BOYSAND GIRLSIF TRL PICKED THESE BOYS UP THEY WILL BLOW UP DEFINATLEY!!IM BUYING THE REST OF THEIR ALBUMS!"
5,Kill Hannah is awesome,"Kill Hannah is one of the best new bands out there right now. They have a unique sound, which is really unlike most bands I've ever heard. Mat has a very nice voice, very soothing and sexy. The music is catchy and something different. ""Kennedy"" captures you with it's head bobbing beat. All the rest of the songs have their own sound too. I personally love Kill Hannah, and I strongly reccomend it to anyone who wants something new and exciting to listen to. Not to mention that the band is hot."
4,My 2 cents,"I did enjoy this book, though I felt it was sloww getting started. I agree with another reviewer, that while reading the last 80 to 100 pages, the book was very hard to put down."
5,An unbelievably good book. Stunning. Amazing.,"This book won a Pulizter back in, I guess, the 20's. It is an amazing book. Parts of it seem surreal, as when the main characters explore the inside of an ocean-side mountain. But the people in the book are interesting, well-developed, and believable. Goodrich co-wrote the screenplay for ""It's A Wonderful Life"", but there's no resemblance."
2,fun while it lasts,my four year old got it for his birthday it lasted about a 1/2 hour. he had a great time playing with it but it rips easily and if you can see where the whole is you can patch it but it keeps ripping unless you can play with it maybe in a football field where ther are no obstacles to run into.
2,Good Concept,"This started out being a good toy for outside, but the first throw by our front yard tree, and there was a big rip in the hover disc. I was hoping that it would last more then 3 minutes! :("
5,Clearly presented ideas,"As a former student of Professor Jacoby at UCLA, I felt that this was a wonderful book explaining his philosophy on the fall of Utopian thinking. His knowledge on the subject comes through as clearly as it did in class. This should be a must read for anyone interested in why we no longer dream of a perfect society to exist in the future, and have become content with something that falls dramatically short of it."
5,silver to gold,"i had searched for this album for al ong time before finding it here. so the expectations were high (to say the least) but they delivered just as i had expected. i have always loved the noisier aspects of sonic youth, just as i have always loved the noisier aspects of lou reed (which is why i hold his metal machine music in high esteem as one of his most definite works) and that is why i love this album just as i hold their tribute to the 20th century avantgarde composers to be their best non-songbased albums."
1,Feedback this ....,"I have listened to alot of sonic youth and loved it.... even the wierd stuff (mirror/dash, & willian hooker trio) but even compaired to the SYR albums this one ..... I can't imagine anyone listening to this album on purpose. I love sonic youth and their heart was in the right place ... i guess but come on now if you wanna pay tribute do it with a little art.but thats just my opinion"
4,the best of the SYR releases,"Sonic Youth has been experimenting alot with guitar/feedback style noise for awhile and have used their own SYR label to release a lot of these endeavors, none really come through like Silver Sessions. Out of the madness of their blaring amplifiers and a broken beat box, the band mixed and mastered a smooth, sonic soundscape that perhaps fulfills this side of sonic youth more than any other recording. Other SYR releases have offered some very interesting material, but this one is the most consistent piece. It's not for everyone and is a big departure from the structured rock of their Geffen releases. Silver Sessions is actually quite un-abnoxious compared to SYR3, or Thurston Moore's side projects like ""Barefoot in the Head"". If you are just getting into sonic youth, this probably isn't a representative introduction, but it is the perfect intro into the band's independent noise outings."
4,Out there sublime...,"This is only the second CD I have listened to by Sonic Youth. My recent familiarity with the group comes long overdue. While this music (and yes, it IS music) certainly is not for everyone, and might best fit in a genre called simply ""other"", it is not without merit. This is sound you experience. The serious listener will be drawn by the moody and textural layering of sounds created primarily by guitars, heavy on the distortion. Songs end abruptly--like falling off the edge of a canvas--giving a painterly nod. Artsy without the fartsy. Lie back, breathe deeply and let your mind take a vacation with this one."
4,Joshua Rifkin plays Joplin,Enjoyed this cd. Not my favorite but a nice arrangement of rags and played well by Rifkin.
2,Ok.,"I suppose it's alright for a first time out, but i pesonally like there later material much better."
4,L'America,"A facinating look at the lives of two lovers through the years, their stories gradually revealed in their and other various characters' voices interwoven throughout the novel. Beth and Cesare, from two very different worlds - literally, meet and fall desperately in love on a Greek island, then continue their romance both in Cesare's Italy and Beth's America. Tradition, ambition & cultural expectations keep them apart yet they continue to remain emotionally attached.A wonderfully intriguing tale of passion and the two very different cultures that shape these lovers and ultimately make their love impossible."
1,Overwrought prose,"There's telling a story and then there's wresting every bit of nuance and meaning from every single sentence. Unfortunately, in my opinion, McPhee falls into the later category of novelists.Prose is so overworked that reading becomes a duty, not a pleasure!"
2,BORING BOOK,"I was so bored with this book that I didn't care if I finished it or not. I suppose if I was much younger, I could appreciate it more as a romantic novel. I would rate it highly for excellent character development, but the writing did not captivate me. Sorry, but I felt as if I wasted my money."
2,Not quite Sam Spade or Philipp Marlowe,"If you are looking for a nice and easy Miss Marple-esque kind of story, this one's for you. If you are looking for a more action oriented novel with some grit, such as I usually like to read, this one's not for you. Accidental detective stumbles into a crime and solves it, of course. Interesting was the insights into the Japanese sub-culture in California and Japan and their history. Other than that I am not sure if this was supposed to be a hommage to Marlowe and Spades or a poor copy. Once again if you are looking for ""Agatha-Christie-on-a-budget"", maybe not bad at all."
2,Death in Little Tokyo,"The ""who done it"" part of the book was very good. At the beginning of the book I would never have guessed ""who did it"".What I did not like about this book is the fact every chance the author had he gave a ""lecture"" about race in America and how bad Americans treat Asoian Americans. There are problems with the way the Americans treat people, but the main purpose of this book was to tell the readers how bad Asian Americans are treated not to be a mystery book."
4,FRY PAN,HEAVY GUAGE AND TEFLON HAVE SOME TIME NOW AND EVEN WITH A COUPLE OF SCRATCHES IN CENTER STILL WORKS O.K.
5,A Fun Toy,"I got his for my almost 4 year old son and he loves it! He bounces around in it and he's pretty rough, but this ball pit is very durable. A good choice for a kid who likes to bounce around, and it's safe & better than them jumping in places they shouldn't be! 100 balls are okay, but I'd suggest 200 to make it more full."
3,fun for some...,"i bought this for my daughter when she was 18 months old, she showed some interest, mainly in throwing all 100 balls out into the living room! now that she is almost 2 1/2 she shows no interest in it at all. we've had her friends come over and they will jump in and almost immediately jump out. it is extremely durable and very safe for young kids that like to bounce around but i agree that you need more balls to fill it up. this item is pretty reasonably priced so if you're thinking about it, go ahead, it's worth a shot!"
2,Not very durable - but fun!,We bought this for our 15 month sld and she loves it. The quality is very poor - the first one we received deflated in 2 hours (plus all the balls arrived flat) and the second one is not holding up well either. Balls were deflated in both but we used balls from a ball pit our son had several years ago.Overall ball pits are fun for kids but this one is not very durable.
2,Unsatisfied with product quality,"I purchased this product for my 1 year old twin girls. They loved it the from the time they got it until I had to throw it away. I noticed at first that it was slowly deflating and I would have to re-inflate it every day. Then after about a week the leak got worse. We were so disappointed that the sub wasn't more durable, and my girls only weigh about 18 lbs. each. The only thing we could think of was maybe the seams were defected. Just imagine if a 3 or 4 year old were to play in it. If I had only paid $5-$10 then I wouldn't be so upset but after shipping it ended up being about $35. It just wasn't worth it for them to only get to play in it for less than 1 month."
5,Very good my 3 year old loves it.,"This is a great ball tent my three year old loves it! Although you have to by the balls, although I sometimes fill it with water ""like a pool"", he likes it with water in the summer cause we don't have a pool (and can't afford one) so it works out good.:-)"
3,Dece,The size is accurate. I'm more used to the neck hole being wider than this and also the hand openings are a little tight. Other than that it fits fine.
5,Cheap at twice the price,"I'm a cheapskate, so I was pretty excited to find that some colors of this were available for around $6. I bought two brown and two orange and they've held up very well for more than six months of regular wear. Very comfortable weight, and no pilling or holes so far.Orange isn't nearly as ugly as everyone will tell you. Give it a try!"
5,Awesome sweatshirts by Jerzees,"Love the color, the fit, everything. Its so bright. But, I love that about it. Always received products in a very timely manner. Will order again I am sure. Would recommend to everyone. I like mine a little bigger so I ordered a size larger. I wear it with leggings and high boots."
5,review,"The jacket is comfortable and fits me well, & it came sooner than expected in a good air tight package."
3,A bit small,"I liked the color on these -- I chose the safety green. However, I am a person who sports a large, and when I ordered a large sweatshirt and got a very small ""medium-at-most"" I was a bit upset. Still like this sweatshirt though."
3,Perhaps for beginning beaders...,"Most of the designs are rather dated, giving me 70's flashbacks, and the earrings, pictured without ear wires, are quite long on their own. With the extra length of a French hook, for example, they'd be a bit much for every day wear. Most of the color plates (just a few pages) had a distinct Native American air to them, as well.Not a book I'd buy again, but not worth sending back, either."
3,OK on a low-budget scale.,"Ancient monster is unleashed on Greek Island where a man (Martin Kove) goes to search for his sister. James Earl Jones, Jose Ferrer and Lila Kedrova add credibility to this somewhat predictable thriller, but you can't help in getting swept away as the story unfolds. The awful music score and murky photography make this look ultra-cheap, and the ending is pretty thrill-less, but overall good in a trashy sort of way."
3,Low budget but very intriguing.,"Visitors' curiosity while on a Greek island unleashes an ancient creature upon unsuspecting island goers. This very low-budget film suffers from poor lighting but has a solid cast (James Earl Jones, Jose Ferrer, Martin Kove and Oscar-winner Lila Kedrova) and an intriguing enough premise that it draws you in, even if it is far from a classic."
3,No one can eat just one virgin,"We are treated to a quickie frontal flash view of Greek virgin to hold our attention through the move in hope of more. In this ancient ritual she has a coin in her mouth and a smile on her face as she is about to become creature chow.Flash forward, Neil Grice (Martin Kove) and wife (Mary-Louise Weller) came to this Greek island to find his wayward sister. He meets authorities with negative attitudes and other strange beings as Frye (James Earl Jones). Fry has some sort of underwater secret. We also see that when Frye lies on his back on the beach the James Earl Jones stomach is almost flat. Oddly enough if the sister (Deborah Shelton) can be found she will turn out to be a tasty virgin artist with secrets of her own.This movie would not live up to its name sake if they did not free an ancient creature with the munchies. Does he only eat virgins or is he omnivorous and snack on anything that moves?How will this all end?Mysterious Island of Beautiful Women"
5,*****By Treasure Box Collection. Digitally Remastered*****,An American treasure hunter (James Earl Jones) awakens an ancient sea creature who has been resting for centuries near the shores of a Greek island. It's up to the island's lifelong residence to stop the creature from executing it's wrath on humanity. One man in particular (Jose Ferrer) had been studying the history of the monster and now his knowledge is nothing less than imperative to the villager's survival.
1,Camera-Shy Monster Eats Virgins,"Ever seen a movie that just made you angry? BLOOD TIDE made me quite angry. James Earl Jones visits a Greek island and frees a monster who starts eating the local women. James, how could you go from STAR WARS to this?And don't you just hate it when the Monster Staff design a cool creature, but then the director decides to be a jerk and give the beast about three seconds of screentime? That's exactly what they did here. And what's with that cheesey pop song in the end credits?Avoid this tripe. It could of been so cool, but wound up sucking hard."
2,el cheapo golden turkey award clucko!!!,"One of the cheapest movies you'll see made. In-fact, this is a fun movie to poke fun at. Despite the movies' cast (James Earl Jones) and some very pretty actresses, that alone is not enough to save this from being one of the worst horror films ever made. The movie seemed to drag on and on and on.If you want to waste about 90 minutes of your life, go and watch this film. I gave this movie a ** instead of 1 because of the very pretty actresses and the nice location (ie, Greek island). But you could very well save yourself 90 agonizing minutes and order a 10-minute tourist video of Greece which would show you the beautiful women and scenary. Forget about the cheesy story and awful special effects."
5,Great rumbas and a very good value,"The Werner Tauber Orchestra and the Etienne Cap Orchestra are well known for excellent sound. There is a good mix between vocal and instrumental tracks. The tempos are appropriate to rumba, with two exceptions: ""Loca passion"" by Pedro Valeria (disc 2, track 6) is a cha cha. ""Another sad love song"" by the Art Dance Project (disc 2, track 8) is a West Coast Swing."
4,The Romance Languages,"The book satisfied the strict demands of my university professor and I enjoy reading it. However,the vendor did not do a good job at describing the quality of the book.The cover is falling apart, the borders are dirty,brown and curling, so much so that I had to take a wet paper towel with clorox and wipe the book before I could dare to touch it and read it, not to mention the expected highlighted pages. I paid over $ 80.00 for it. A classmate bought the same book for $35 in great condition. Shame on the seller that dares to get so much money for that book."
4,sump basin cover,"Nice heavy cover. Fits basin well. Had to modify , cut slot, but was no problem. I would buy this product again."
3,"A bit vague, better off downloading the real service manuals","This is a nice supplement for a begginer to begin restoration, or maintenance to their Honda. It lacks detail in some subjects which the real service manual can elaborate on. If you know where to find it, just download the Honda Service manual."
3,"Funny, but strange","The erratic and slightly disjointed story of how a television chef falls for her station manager . . . Mildly funny at times, but there's no particular logic to the sequence of events or the characters' changing feelings for each other. SPOILER: This book's main reason for existence is to prove that you should never hide engagement rings in food."
5,Written by the group of women who have been there,"I bought this book when I was pregnant with my first child (6 years ago) at the recommendation of my childbirth instructor. The book is so encouraging and has so much great information in it. I never needed another book. All three of my children were breastfeed for an average of 1 year and I used this book as reference through it all - the good, the bad, and the ugly! I am buying another one for my sister in law, who is going to try breastfeeding her new little one on the way!"
5,A must-have book for nursing moms!,"I bought a copy of this book when I was pregnant and I don't think I would have been able to keep breastfeeding without it. I have to disagree with those who say it doesn't address possible difficulties. It covers everything you could want to know about breastfeeding, and has good advice for how to cope with just about any problem. Perhaps it's not well indexed if someone had trouble finding info on mastitis, because it's in there! I had mastitis twice and this book was indispensible. It offers the support nursing mothers need and can't always get from friends, doctors and family."
1,"I really wanted to rate it a big, fat, ZERO","After my daughter was born, one of my sisters-in-law gave me a copy of this book as a gift. She is an ob/gyn with 3 kids of her own, so I thought this was going to be a real help to me--especially as I was having a lot of nipple pain whenever my daughter fed off my left breast. Unfortunately, I was sadly, sadly disappointed. Whatever question I had, the only answer the book had was ""Consult your local La Leche League"" coordinator. I also felt that any woman who was considering breastfeeding her child for a short period of time only would be made to feel guilty for that decision. All in all, I was very, very disappointed. I would recommend this book only for those of you who have some money to throw away and a bird cage to line."
2,Not as comprehensive as advertised,"We purchased this book after having spoken to a relative who has been LLL for 20 years, lactation consultants, neo-natal intensive care specialists, a doula and pediatrician. My wife was so looking forward to breast-feeding we wanted to do everything right. Unfortunately, our son has other ideas. Our pediatrician believes that some babies just do not like taking milk from the breast.So, now that you know where I am coming from, here is my beef about the book. Throughout the book, problems are brought out, but instantly dissolve if only the baby is breastfed. The book purports to be comprehensive, yet it has no information for babies who are drinking expressed breast milk from a bottle. Apparently, LLL believes that milk taken directly from the breast is the only type of breast feeding that exists (or should.)"
1,Some good but definately biased info,"My husband's aunt gave me this book when we were trying to get pregnant. In my sixth month of pregnancy I started reading this book and at first found some of the information helpful. Especially the information on a baby latching correctly. But, as I went forward I was extremely disappointed with the breast is the only way mentality and I was really grossed out by the chapter feeding your toddler and newborn, complete with a picture of a 2-1/2 year old feeding on one breast and a newborn on the other. I sincerely hope that breastfeeding works out for me but I don't want to set myself up to feel like I've somehow ruined my child's life because I didn't breastfeed. My advice is to skip this book and try to find one that isn't so shove down your throat with breastfeeding."
3,"Has good basic information, but is preachy and narrow minded","When searching for answers to quesitons and problems, I often found statements that made me feel GUILTY rather than helpful how-to information. The last thing a new mother needs is more guilt! For an equally supportive but much more realistic and well organized book try Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding by Marianne Neifert, M.D."
2,"Like digging for gold, you'll need to dig past the testimonies to find the useful info.","~If you're looking for reasons why you should breastfeed, this book is for you. But if you already know you want to breastfeed and only want the straight facts on"
2,Biased against working mothers,"One of the reasons I want to breastfeed is because I have to (and WANT to) go back to work. While this book is informative, it is strongly anti-working mother. There is very little information on pumping and storing milk. Testimonials from working mothers emphasize how the mothers dread going back to work and what a chore pumping is. If you are a working mom-to-be then don't bother with this book - it will only tick you off!"
3,"Good Information, But Hard to Get At","I had trouble wading through this book. It wanders a little and the style seemed a bit fragmented. There's good stuff in there, but it's sandwiched between many side stories (which tend to end with ""I called LLL and they fixed everything"") and a good deal of personal/LLL opinion. It might ALMOST have been better titled ""La Leche's Advice for Early Child-Rearing, with Notes on Breast-Feeding"". (For example, they tell you not to spank... I got spanked, though not often, and I remember it as loving, last-resort discipline which worked.)A better buy might be ""The Complete Book of Breastfeeding"", by Marvin S. Eiger and Sally Wendkos Olds. I read that book through with pleasure and would recommend it to anyone."
2,Not helpful if you are having problems breastfeeding,"I own this book, and recently consulted it while struggling with a bout of severe mastitis while at the same time wondering how to stop my six month old from biting me. I looked at the index for ""mastitis"" and found NOTHING. I looked at the index under ""biting"" and found only references to toddler biting, not infant biting. I had very few problems breastfeeding my daughter until she weaned herself at 10 months, but breastfeeding my second child has been more of a challenge, and this book is no help at all. In my view, the book is more a platform for selling La Leche League's parenting philosophies than a real help to breastfeeding mothers experiencing difficulties. La Leche League has some admirable goals and philosophies, but so many women stop breastfeeding because they experience challenges like mastitis or biting, and this book fails to even recognize those problems."
3,"Good Info, but with a lot of bias","La Leche League is not just a breastfeeding support group -- it is a philosophy of parenting. This book strongly supports that philosophy, i.e., co-sleeping, nonspanking, stay-at-home-moms, no-intervention births, etc. Only about half the book is dedicated to breastfeeding information, and even that is a little bit disjointed. For a more concise and to-the-point resource solely about breastfeeding, I found The Nursing Mother's Companion by Kathleen Huggins to be much more helpful."
1,To much,"I found the book to be great as far as teaching you how to physically nurse. However, I felt that a lot of the information the book provided was to extreme and the LLL made you feel like an awful parent if you did not do everything to their extreme. An example would be that you are shutting up your baby by using a pacifier. The book goes on to say that in German pacifier means dummy, but last I checked in English it means to pacify and that's what it does. I agree that you can abuse it, but like everything else you need to use it in moderation. I do not recommend this book to anyone who is iffy about nursing because this book will turn you away, making you think that you have to follow their rules and that it's a lot harder then it really is."
1,There are much better books available,"I found this book extremely disappointing. Basically, it's a propaganda piece about how great breastfeeding is (which I agree, it is wonderful). But the book is not so helpful when you need information about breastfeeding problems. It's doesn't have enough unbiased, practical information on breast infections, alternate feeding plans for babies having trouble latching on, or pumping milk when you work outside the home.My daughter was premature and had trouble latching on. So we had to offer a mixture of pumped milk and formula. Much more helpful to me was Kathleen Huggins' Nursing Mother's Companion, a lifesaver."
3,Great for information but not realistic for working mothers,"I appreciated the basic information offered in the book and thought it dealt with my breastfeeding questions. It is a strong text for emotionally supporting a breastfeeding mother. However, when reality is that you are a working mother and also have a toddler to chase I didn't find the book helpful. It presented issues idealistically rather than realistically - breastfeeding takes a lot of time (when you have to pump, store, etc.) and a strong commitment from the entire family. I would have preferred that they own up to this in the book and dealt with it from this angle rather than just the emotional and technical side of breastfeeding (although they did this quite well)"
1,Serious Disappointment,"This book provided extremely BASIC information about breastfeeding. When it comes to difficult issues, the book falls flat, simply referring you to a local La Leche League (LLL) chapter for assistance. It is propaganda, as other reviewers have noted, to coerce women into joining LLL. I didn't need to gather with a group of women, collective breasts exposed, to learn how to breastfeed my child, but I would have appreciated some honest, in-depth advice from a group that claims to be so knowledgeable on the subject.This book was a waste of money."
1,Disappointing book,"I have to preface my review with this: I plan to breastfeed, and I generally support any attempts at educating the public about the importance of breastfeeding. That said....This book is really just self-promotion for LLL - rather than be given a practical solution, you're just told to contact LLL for support when problems arise. It's not terribly informative, mostly it's just an attempt to persuade women to breastfeed (a noble aspiration) but USELESS if you have already made that choice which is likely if you have purchased the book!To reach any useful information, you have to wade through pages of hippie nonsense and preaching. The only great aspect of this book is how often it got me laughing at the stories and quotes, e.g ""you're as beautiful as a tree heavy with fruit."""
3,Informative about the pleasant aspects,"This book covers all the wonderful things about breastfeeding - of which there are a lot. For anyone looking for encouragement for breastfeeding, and/or reasons to give friends and family about why you want to breastfeed, it's a great book.However, if you've already decided to breastfeed, and are looking for something to get you through the tough parts, I can't recommend it. As far a reader could tell from this book, there are no tough parts. My fear is that someone having a difficult time with breastfeeding could decide that something must be really wrong, and quit in discouragement believing that other women don't have such difficulties. Having breastfed my first child to 20 months, and at one year and counting with my second, I can tell you that there are very tough moments in breastfeeding. LLL would be doing women more of a service if they didn't softsoap it, or use the soft-focus filter on all the possible problems."
3,"Too much persuasion, not enough information","I would recommend this book to someone who was unsure about breastfeeding and needed some convincing.I knew I wanted to breastfeed my child, but I didn't know anything about how to do it. I purchased this book hoping it would fill in the how, but it didn't. I rarely picked it up after the baby was born. I found other books much more informative and helpful.I respect this book as the classic it is, and I appreciate the efforts to make breastfeeding more acceptable. For those reasons, it is valuable. For breastfeeding information and guidance, I would select another book."
5,"A Big ""Yes You Can"" to breastfeeding","in the midst of a world full of horror stories and negativity. I am trying for a baby and I plan on breastfeeding at least the first year, and it seems like every time I turn around, I hear from some mother how awful it is and how I'll give it up after the first few weeks. I also can't count the number of times I've heard the words, ""I tried, but I didn't have enough milk"". I know now that more than likely, the particular mother I talked to had plenty of milk, but not enough SUPPORT. Also, everywhere I go, I see little babies with bottles in their mouths, and it makes me wonder if breastfeeding truly is so horrible that everyone gives it up.This book is a reminder that other women have nursed their babies successfully, despite very trying difficulties, so I probably can, too. Every time I'm feeling discouraged or have a question, I pick up this book. My question is always answered, and my confidence always restored."
1,This book has the wrong title,"As other reviewers have said, this book has the wrong title. It should be 'LLL mothering philosphy, go elsewhere for practical advice'. There are only 3-4 pages on how to breastfeed, and the information on those pages is very basic. There is very little advice on good positioning and good latching, both of which are absolutely vital to breastfeeding. The funny thing is that my mother bought an earlier version of this book in the late 60's. I read it, found it fairly helpful, and decided to order a later version, thinking it would be more up-to-date. However, they seem to have taken out most of the helpful stuff from the earlier version."
4,Helpful in a basic way,"As a one-stop, all around basic information source, I loved this book. It covers all basic areas, aspects and concerns of breastfeeding. If you need more specific or more detailed information, a more problem specific book may be needed in addition to this one. I most definitely recommend this book as a general first guide to breastfeeding."
3,"Not my favorite, but a good read","This book is considered to be the ""Bible"" of breastfeeding, but I referred to it the least of the three books I read on breastfeeding. It is a very interesting read, but I found it to be a lot of parenting ""philosophy"" and not enough real, practical help for breastfeeding. The testimonies of other women were fascinating to read but this isn't the book I reached for in the middle of the night to answer the tough questions."
3,Not a Lager Book,"Although this book has a lot of useful information in it, I was disappointed to find it was not about lager at all. It is simply a general purpose brewing book with a lot of emphasis on all grain brewing. This makes it hard to rate because as a lager book it gets zero stars, which is why it was on my Christmas wish list."
5,Excellent Read for Advanced and Beginning Brewers Alike,"This is one of the few book on brewing that I would recommend to everybody who is truly interested in art of making beer. Everything within the book is logically arranged and is layered from baseline topics to more advanced ones. This makes it very easy for Advanced brewers to skip the child's play and move right along into the good stuff, and for beginners to read all they need to know and skip through the scientific mumbo jumbo."
2,Brewing lagers or just brewing?,In short this book was 90% about brewing which I already have several books on. I was thinking this going to be all the tricks and hints on how to make your lagers crisp and clean. You get a few temps and times but other than that just a lot of over your head chemistry and diagrams. I don't need a detailed breakdown of lager yeast to know what it does and why! If you need to know how to boil your wort (it's in here) you don't need to be brewing lagers yet.
2,Lager manufacture,"I enjoyed the book however the technology is outdated and most people ferment lagers at 9-11C, secondary ferment then filter at -2C. Nothing on force fermenting or Hermes systems for infusion mashing. OK reference book for the shelf."
2,Must be for REALLY advanced brewers,"I hesitate giving this book a bad review because it's clear that anyone who does so must not be ""advanced"" enough in homebrewing to appreciate it. (We might not be altogether different from those who couldn't see the emperor's new clothes.)The book certainly isn't about brewing lagers (as opposed to other styles.) The author says as much in his introduction. That was a disappointment. More disappointing was the tone. It read more like a textbook than what I've come to enjoy in ""homebrewing books."" (Books like Papazian's and Palmer's among others.) It screams with the message that brewing is just too serious of a matter to have fun with. I disagree. I guess that means I'm just a beginner."
5,Great Cookware,"Have used this cookware for several days now, and it is definetely worth buying. I took advantage of the reduced prices, and glad I did. The cookware heats up fast and evenly, a joy to use."
2,"Buy these pans for the ""Good Look"" feature only","These new Cuisinart Multiclad line do look very nice and expensive, the constructions seem solid, just a nice first impression product. After buying these pans, I noticed its thickness is almost half thinner than the All-Clad or Calphalon Hard Anodized lines; also, these pans are not to be used for more than 500 degree F, and not recommended for use under Broiler. So, what's really the point of buying these pans other than its ""Good Look"" ? Well, I guess it's quite a disappointment for Cuisinart to release its high-end cookware line while sacrificing its functionality side.

4,VERY NICE,"Mutated fungal spores are spread throughout Britain and soon enough its covered in the various growths as are the people who come in contact with it. A team is sent in to find a way to stop the rapid spreading. This book was quite fast-paced and tightly written so I actually ended up finishing it sooner than I expected to. A great brisk read and much better than the author's ""Slimer""."
2,This book was not to my taste. Other People might enjoy it.,"The plot of this book is certainly an interesting concept, and it would not surprise me in the slightest if something similar were to happen sometime in the future. Scientists proceed on their merry way with little to no thought as to consequences, and disaster is far more likely to originate with some well-meaning scientist eager to save the world, than a malicious renegade. The book itself, however, was mundane at best. The characters were not, in my opinion, believable and, though the author did try, the thrills just simply weren't there. This will not be making it onto my top 10 list, I'm afraid."

4,it is very good book,"I bought this book, it's the best thing I ever did. We read it together and we're still trying new things! I can't recommend it high enough"
1,complete junk,"I honestly don;t care what she has written because I have read them all and I have never encountered a more trite, banal approach to the subject of sexuality. As another reviewer mentioned, she pushes a feminist agenda that comes before any attempts at teaching and most of the really useful info you could get out of any decent relevant newer sex manual. Violet Blue and her ilk are nothing more than people trying to cash in in a trend who don;t have the integrity to write a reasonably informative book. A waste of good paper!"
2,Keep browsing...,"Not as good as it's rated, believe me. Common sense stuff that's just spiced up with folksy english. Yawn."
3,Nice Read,"Nice book if you are a first timer or new to cunnilingus. It tells about the basic's of oral sex. Ultimate is not the basic's. I bought this thinking maybe just maybe it could show me something new about oral sex, with no pictures or illusion just texts telling you to do the same things you and your friends talked about in high school. F.I.Y I done what this book said my first time without a manual. What else can I say about this book. (Yeah I did say Nice Read because if you DON'T KNOW ABOUT cunnilingus or new to it PICK UP THIS BOOK!!! It will help.)"
2,Not the right title!,"The title of this book implies that it will teach you how to give a woman exqusite pleasure through cunnilingus, but having just read the book I don't agree.Much of it is taken up with safe sex information, which is always important, but not why I bought the book. The number of pages actually dedicated to teaching and improving cunnilingus skills is disappointingly small."
2,Wordy,I think there is some good stuff there but some is just common sense. The book could be boiled down to one chapter in my opinion.
4,Great book,I think this is a great book. My husband and I never experimented in this area for many reasons...mostly my own insecurity. This book opened my eyes in all directions. If you are looking for a book to help you in this area it is a good one. I have hunted all over and this is by far the best one! Have fun!
3,Pleased,It hasn't really seemed to help him much. He was already pretty good. Reading through the book was a good way to open up conversation about it though. Compare the books ideas to what really worked for me.
2,Not very informative,"This book was informative but there was a lot of excess I really wasn't interested in. The meat of the book should have been in one chapter for those like me who just want to improve their technique. I had to read the whole book, a lot of it very boring and irrelevant, to pick up little tidbits here and there. All in all it was somewhat informative but definitely not worth the price or the time to read."
5,LOOKIE! Pictures and everything! :D,"""EXCELLENT!!!"" - 'In Depth' coverage of material - Slight lesbian flavor. Very Tasty Read..."
4,really for those already doing it,"There are many tips, tricks, and much useful information in Blue's book. These are for not only the newbie but also the very experienced but the key is to pay attention to your partner. There is one huge problem with the book, the reason I could not give it 5 stars. While time is spent on getting a woman to allow you to go down on her, there is really not much about helping a person learn to enjoy or even try giving cunnilingus. Not everyone is eager to do this and it would be very very helpful if that were addressed in at least as much detail as is given to the subject in Blue's book about fellatio."
5,Is It Foreplay Or The Quickest Route To Satisfaction?,"This is indeed The Ultimate Guide to giving oral sex. Not one part of the vulva is left unfolded. There's some mention of certain women who find it difficult or nearly impossible to reach an orgasm through intercourse, thus, cunnilingus can used as a replacement for the real thing. I flipped the pages quickly trying to find out if there was a medical reason for this dilemma, but that question wasn't answered.At times, the manual seemed a bit technical, but the sensual short stories at the end of the chapters made up for that. With Valentine's day fast approaching, this book seems like the perfect gift!"
4,Interesting Read!,"I picked this book up on a humbug, and while it took me a while to get into it, after awhile I found it hard to put down as I kept wondering how it was going to turn out.I think it's a pretty good try for a first time novelist. I'd be interested in reading more from this author."

1,"2 Books, Same Title",Janet Dailey must be a moron or a hack if she forgot she wrote a novel for Harlequin in 1978 using the exact same title and a completely different story.
3,I thought Jay-Z could do better,"I'm not really a Rap fan, but I thought Jay-Z was a pretty Original rapper. He was talking about hard life in the Ghetto, while Cash Money and No limit were talking about ""ice"" and ""Benji's"". I really thought he was a break-from-the-mold rapper. But this CD is nothing compared to his older works, like Vol. 2 or 3. Besides the first single, this CD is pretty dull. I would suggest any other Jay-Z CD over this one."
3,jigga not so jigga anymore,I anticipated this album when i heard about and was very disappointed when i bought it.The production just isnt there as is was in vol 2 and 3.There is only 5 good songs on this cd.I would buy vol 2 before i purchased this album
3,An Average cd,This cd was a dissapointment. Volume 2 and 3 were better than this. It only had about 5 or 6 good songs in it. The 1st single in the cd gets old after a short time. The only great songs on the cd were Get your Mind Right mami and Parkin Lot Pimpin. Soon You'll Understand was an alright song. Other than that the cd was lacking.
4,DA ROC,"Da Roc has done it again. Jay-z displays his natural talent to flow for the streets, clubs and cars. Jay-z shows why we love his music , style and vertilatity on the mic. Jay-z is one of the only rapper(the other Nas), that can be known as a lyricist, he shows and proves. Beanie Seigal and perform well. Memphis Bleek has improve his rap skills alot. This album could be a whole lot better but the stand out tracks are 1,3,4,5,7,10,11,12,14,15. Get the album to roll to."
2,COME AGAIN?,"WHAT IS THIS? I WAS EXPECTING MORE TIGHT SOUNDING BEATS AND LYRICAL SKILLS. THIS ALBULM IS A FLOP. THE ONLY TRACKS THAT ARE TIGHT ARE 3,5,6,14 AND 16.IF SOMEONE ELSE IS BUYING, GET IT. DONT WAIST YOUR OWN MONEY."
4,Hip Hop's Very Own Omnipresence,"Okay, okay, okay. I am a HUGE Jay Z fan. I believe that he can pretty much do no wrong. However - I strongly agree and strongly disagree with a lot of things said on the reviews. First of all, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Jay Z has done better, I will admit to that, but there was never a greater oxymoron than the worst CD by Jay Z."
5,JAY-Z'S BEST,"""The Dynasty"" is the best Jay-Z album that i've ever heard.It is a large improvement from ""Vol.3..Life And Times Of S. Carter"",even though that album was great.I can listen to every song on here,without one complaint.If this is just the start of what is to come from Jay-Z in the future,it's gonna be big.My favorite songs are""Give It To Me"",""Streets is Talking"",""This Is Life"",and""1-900 Hustler"".Buy this CD,you can't go wrong."
1,This was jay-Z worst,I bought a bootleg for [$$$] but after I heard this cd I wanted my money back... Buy volume 3 or blueprint instead...
4,Lots of good club songs and beats on this album!,"Jay-Z's 2000 album had a lot more club songs and beats to make you dance, yet his distinctive rap style blends with the songs. I like I Just Wanna Love You, his first involvement with the Neptunes. Each album, he always tries something different. Memphis Bleek and Beanie Siegel and the R.O.C. group have a hand in many of the songs. Beanie is the better rapper here, while Memphis still has that cocky, ticking-people-off style. Perhaps the song's standout was the last song Where Have You Been, as Jay chastises his father for abandoning him and his mother when he was young. Somehow his father heard that song and went see him again about 2 years later. All these people that say that rap is violent should stop for a minute. It made a father want to come back to his son and Where had to have affected Jay's father emotionally. This is one of Jay's best songs. Dynasty did just as well as the '99 album, yet still had its own strength in singles."
4,A Familia Like No Other,"This is a slammibg album believe me but only for the true Jay-Z fans. All of you looking for killer beats and guests...sorry wrong cd for ya. This cd focuses on Jay and his Familia. I really flet this cd he must have put alot of heart and soul into this cd cause there were so many cuts that really left me thinking.....but nothing hit me harder than # 16 ""Where have you been"" Its about a Dead-beat Father Believe it or not i think Beanie Siegel shines the brightest here you feel so much of his pain on his verse. Then at the end of the song with that 10-15 seconds of silence just the music was great Jay really wanted you to know that this song was important. unfortunately i went through the same thing. BANGING cuts you ask easy! Parking Lot Pimping, Change the Game and I just wanna Love you"" I really recomend this cd alot listen to it with a open mind and you will feel what Jay had in mind when he put this piece together Peace!"
1,"Lacks depth and emotion, highly over-rated.","Jay-Z has no depth in his rappin'. All his songs are about how much ice he has, cars, groupies, and other shallow concepts. Not only that, all his songs sound the same, have the same boring feel to them. I wonder if the leading age in buying Jay-Z records is in the ninety-year-old senior citizens category. His lyrics were at one time good but he's totally fallen off since his second album. The track with Snoop, ""Get Your Mind Right Mami"" could've been a lot better, it wasn't very impressive, mediocre at BEST. And it was the best song on the CD. Let me tell you, if Jay-Z is the leader in today's commercial hip-hop world, we're in a lot of trouble. I don't like hearing about Kurupt and Daz doing a song with him either. I admit ""Change The Game"" remix with Kurupt and Daz was good but they don't need Jay-Z to sell records. Stay Away From This."
3,"Not Quite Vol. 3, Much Less Earlier Albums","The guest stars on 'Roc La Familia' aren't as far reaching as those on his earlier albums. Think back: 'Volume 3: The Life and Times of S. Carter' had Dr. Dre, Mariah Carey, Juvenile, Timbaland, Underground Kings, and a few others. This album has: Scarface and Snoop Dogg on two tracks, neither of which have been of any real relevance since the early- to mid-90's, DJ Clue, who is neither a DJ nor has a clue, and R. Kelly, who provides the only real guest appearance aside from a bunch of others (say, the 'Familia') that happen to be on Jay-Z's label. Still, tracks like 'I Just Wanna Love You' are sure to be blasting out of shiny Civics everywhere, and there's enough sincerity in 'This Can't Be Life' and 'Soon You'll Understand' to forgive the guest star misses and grade-B beats."
1,The epitome of what's wrong in Hip Hop! ( 0 stars),"It features weak lyrics over loud commercial beats centering on a rapper's obsession with material goods and bragging about how he used to be Nicky Barnes. To add insult to injury it's an amateur hour+ of bad lyricists who just happen to be down with his crew and the CD features cameos that don't work. The sad part is that the industry is pushing this as a back to the streets classic, this garbage will sell on his name only. I call it the Master P syndrome, no matter how bad it is millions will buy it. Support real hip hop buy the WU!"
4,His most personal release to date.,"Most people was not too happy with this release. But if you actually take time to listen to the album Jay spills out his heart on this cd. ""This Can't Be Life"", and ""Soon You'll Understand"" proves just that. You can hear the emotion in Jay's voice on ""Where Have You Been"". Please do not single this album out untill you really listened to it. You might like it."
2,Only 2 good songs,"This cd isnt very good. There is only 2 good songs on it. thats # 2 and # 16. #3 use 2 be good, but they overplayed it on mtv, and on the radio. so now i hate it. really, dont waste your money on this cd, its really bad its not worth the 2 songs"
3,Big Letdown...,"I don't know what happened...Jay Z has lost something here...plus the production is terrible....Where is Timbaland and Swizz!! Guess he didn't like paying to get top notch production anymore...well, it will cost him in sales, cause this release is weak!!"
5,"Great Jay-Z album, most own if you're a fan...","I recently started collecting all of Jay's earlier work that I had not purchased when initally released. Though he's an incredible rapper, stays relavent to the game, his older material has classic hits/material that any HUGE Jay-Z fan needs to own. It's like discovering a shiny diamond in the middle of a freshly plowed field on Grandpa's farm. The beats, the rhymes the way he speaks in his earlier material, you can tell the up and coming rapper was HUNGRY and kept looking for success and hits too. By the time he met up with Kanye, his material improved that much greater. Most definitely recommend this album. Starts off TOP heavy and then weakens near the end; however, still a class Jay album to own.Thanks."
3,Notin' impressive at all! Don't belive the hype!,More of a clique album than a solo album. It lacks lyrics AND NOT WROTH YOUR MONEY! Vol. 3 still the best!
5,Like no other,"Jay-Z has done it once again yet with all teh controversy he stills maintains at the top of his game. With such slamming tracks ""Give it to me"" and ""Change the game"" the jigga man claims to be no.1 and there is nothing nothing no one can do about it. Jay-Z proves that he can hold down his turf yet his Dynasty at the blink of an eye. This Cd lets you witness Roc-a-fella at it's best."
3,"The Best Lyrically, But That's About It","Jay-Z is by far the best lyrical rapper in the rap game today, hands down. He can flow to any beat and come up with rhymes that leave you in awe. But lyrics can only take you so far and on Dynasty it shows. Now like I mentions above, Jay-Z can flow to any beat, but on Dynasty Jay-Z was clearly challenged. This was caused by the absence of the all-star line-up of producers. Now I give credit to Jay-Z for not going the Vol. 3 line-up, but I will say that it didn't help this album any. Also, the 800 appearences made by the Roc-A-Fella camp on the album get quite annoying. As good as Memphis Bleek and Beanie Sigel are, I can only take so much of them before I just get sick of them. Overall, Dynasty is just your average rap album: cheap production, to many guest apperences, and just too much bragging. Next time Jay-Z, just let the album feature your skills and no one else's."
4,Good but not Great,This Lp had some hits on it.Production was tight but it just played itself with me really fast. It still was one of Jay's better Lps and was probably the best Hip Hop Lp that year. Jay does it agian.
3,"A decent effort, but not Reasonable Doubt","Poor Jigga. No matter what he does, every single album that he ever makes will always be compared to Reasonable Doubt and rightfully so. Out of 16 tracks, 3 are worth listening to....Hopefully Nas reads this so that he can rip Jay once again for everything he's said. This Can't Be Life and Soon You'll Understand are two of my favorite Jay-Z songs of all time, and I Just Wanna Love U is classic, although I will never understand the cheesey abbreviations using U and 2 instead of you and two, too etc. But anyways, back to the music. This isn't really a Jay-Z album, this is a Roc-A-Fella colabo....and quite frankly M Easy and Beans are wack!!!! The only tight lyrical rhyme that Memphis Bleek has ever put out was on Reasonable Doubt, and Beans puts forth a decent effort on THis Can't Be Life. Hopefully Jay will come correct on his 7th album, or not come at all."
2,Could have been much better,"Well when your intro beat is better than 80% of your album you know it's not going to be a great album. Jay Z needs to go back to how he was in Vol 1 and stop doing albums for only money and start entertaining his fans. Download it, don't buy it."
2,Weak on so many levels,"Two words of advice: Lose Beans. His flow is garbage. He's better free-styling than on wax but, even so, it's still soft as hell. On ""Change the Game"", he actually utters the lines ""Get your wig pushed back by the wig-push-backer."" What? And Bleek is aight but too immature to take the throne after Jay steps down."
3,The Dynasty: A New Era in the Roc La Familia,"Jay-z is back at it again. Caveat Emeptor...this is a new format for Jay-Z. No Timberland or Swizz Beats. No hidden tracks. Numberous posse cuts with Memphis & Beans. A track where Memphis carries the whole song.Jay-z's lyrics are on when he's heated..but for the most part of the album, it's Hawiian Sophie Status.Good Effort, worth buying but beware..it's a little different."
3,Worth a Listen,"Without any stand-out tracks like last year's Big Pimpin' featuring UGK, Do it Again, or Snoopy Track, Dynasty falls short of the near perfection cut by the same Jay-Z on Life and Times...Memphis Bleek and Beanie Segiel appear in nearly every track. I would have preferred to hear just Jay himself during the length of the entire album."
3,Jay-Z and theThree Stooges,"The Dynasty album was originally was supposed to be a compliation album, but afer the release of The Hard Knock Life Tour CD, it became a Jay-Z album. Do you know why Jay-Z won't ever make good on his threat to retire? Because his artists won't go platinum with out him(actually, they won't go platinum with him, but that's another story), and this album shows why. Don't get me wrong, there are some good songs(I Just Wanna Love You, This Can't Be Life, Change The Game) but hopefully Jay-Z will see the light one day. Hopefully."
2,Not Vintage Jay,"I really was dissapointed by Jay Z's much anticipated CD. Outside of ""I Just Wanna Love You,"" and ""Soon You'll Understand,"" This CD is straight up wack. And I am a big Jay Z fan. No tracks on the CD even resemble the past Jay Z brilliance. If you are a fan looking for a great Jay Z CD, buy either ""Streets is Watchin"" or ""Life and times of S. Carter."""
2,"Backwards spiral - this a compolation, not a Jayz album","Stereotypical bs. I expect more from J. I am a true hip hop fan that can see past the stardom that J has reached. He needs to kick Beanie, Memphis, and poor Amil off the album. We don't want a compolation, be want a real JZ album.This is the worst album J has ever made. It is evident that he is no longer hungry for paper. This album shows no growth. Reasonable doubt, Vol.1 were great. This album should have never been released."
3,3.75,WHAT MORE CAN I SAY...THE VINTAGE ROC CREW LAID IT DOWN...ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY DIDN'T SHOULD TAKE SOME DUST AND LISTEN TO P.M. DAWN......MAYBE THE WORLD WILL OPEN UP TO THEM.... HAHAHAHAHAHATERS....
1,Jigga What? Jigga Who Cares...,"This album is foolish. Foolish and Empty. Empty and Superficial. Money, women, and violence. Which I guess would be okay if it weren't rapped about over such stupid beats in such a stupid way."
2,ROC's Worst,"I had Vol. 3 be Jay-Z's worst. Even though it is a Jay Z album, there are a lot of guest appearances by Memphis Bleek, Talib Kweli, and Amil. Talib Kweli is the best of them and Bleek is an awful lyricist and Amil is a Foxy Brown ripoff. Jay-Z puts some good material despite, like ""I Just Wanna Love U"".Not a good album. Very commercialized. Don't buy it unless you are a huge Rocafella fan."
1,are you kiding me?,"worst album ever this, guy can't even rap anymore. I would not pay anything for this cd. why has musci gone so commercial. No song on this album has any heat to eat. Just dance happy tracks all over the album with R&B hooks. The whole rap industry is gonna be done with in a couple of years if they don't clean up there act; and start puttin out some respectable music. this album and Jays last two albums have been trash. The beats he uses are unoriginal and what he is saying the same stuff money, hoes and clothes is that all this brother knows. One last peral of wisdom why is it that Jay comes out with a album every 6 months but the other acts signed to roc-a-fella take like fifty years to drop albums. I'm still waitin on Rells album he was signed to roc-a-fella over 2 years ago. And what ever happen to Christion? Don't waste your money horrible cd."
4,Keep em comin Jiggaman,"Jay-Z is in my opinion the best rapper out there. Since Tupac died( he is the greatest ) Jigga has shown how good he can be. Tupac was the greatest but Jigga is now. He's a terrific MC and sounds good with it. This is another great album from a great rapper. This album and his previous one are Jay-Z's best albums, though this is maybe not as good as Volume 3 but its still very good. Here are my favourite tracks: Change the Game, I Just Wanna Luv U, Streets is Talking, Get Ur Mind Right Mami, Guilty Until Proven Innocent, Parking Lot Pimpin, Soon You'll Understand, Squeeze 1st, Where Have U Been These r the best but the others r good."
2,umm,"Roc La Familia 2000...WTF. Jay Z is a joke. His beats don't go anywhere, Jay Z is one of the guys who is dragging hip hop into the ground. If you want good hip hop music you have to return to the early-mid 90's. Dynasty my @$$"
1,Some run of the mill commercial crap,I saw Jay Z on MTV saying this was the best album he has everdone. Thats just ridiculous. Lets listen to ryhmes about how muchmoney Jay Z has!!! won't that be fun. The beats are weak and ryhmesare all the same with few exceptions. This album was made for 14 yearold pimple faced suburbian kids. This is not hip hop. It's sodisapointing considering he actually has a lot of talent.
5,A remarkable and informative book!,I enjoyed Dr. Kamen's sense of humor and his techniques. My cat had trouble walking and I used these great techniques. Thank you Dr. Kamen!!
3,Solid but nothing too special,"I enjoyed this album after buying it for $5 at a punk record shop in Allston. It looked like an indie/grunge compilation from the early ninties, and seemed political and thoughful in nature. It pretty much met my expectations, so I'd give it three stars, simply because it didn't exceed my expectations. The Jawbreaker song is good, and there were some other decent punk and indie tracks. It sounded more Seattle or DC (like early Fugazi or Fidelity Jones) more than Californian, but I don't like to generalize. Overall, if you're into political music from the early ninties and you enjoy indie, grunge or punk, you'd do well to pick it up (if it's cheap)."
1,I Was Tricked!,"I thought ""Original Recording Remastered"" meant the company took the original recording and cleaned up any background noise or degradation of the recording that occurs over time, and I would end up with a beautiful sounding original oldie. Instead, these are totally remade. There isn't anything original about them other than the title. I am very disappointed in this trickery and this CD."
5,New Life with New Universe,"This CD is a breath of fresh air. Lori Wilshire's soaring vocals, Micah's smooth harmonies backed by the tight, catchy, well orchestrated music is phenomenal. You can't help but tap your feet, strum some air guitar, and sing along. Excellent!"
5,The Very Best of Glasgow Detectives,"Along with Rebus, and Wire in the Blood, these show the very best of Scotland and in particular Glasgow. While doing the series Mark Mcmanus died. Lt Jardin (his side kick you'll meet in the 3rs series and former WPC Jackie continued the series. I don't have any trouble understanding a Scottish accent although many do. It has to do with cadence (rhythm) of their speech. I adore this series and have waited since 1989 for either a video or dvd viewable here. I had taped them while living there but I forgot about the speed difference. It should make for interesting viewing!"
3,Pergolesi Salve Regina with rarities from the late baroque.,"There are better recordings of the Pergolesi Salve Regina but the other items are more interesting: Gaetano Donizetti: Parafrasi del Christus, and Francesco Bonporti: Mittite Dulces and Ite molles.Regina Klepper (sop) and Martina Borst (mezzo) with harpsichord, double bass and string Quartet."
5,Old man and more,"I haven't seen this movie in many years and for some unknown reason it wasn't part of my dvd collection.But for the low price I bought it and during the movie I began to slowly recall what I rememberedor missed while watching it as a young kid. Spencer Tracy is at his finest as the Old Man, who has been outof luck catching fish. But still a young boy befriends him and is a real touching part of the story.Tracy thru his own narration though carries the movie and one of the great actors of our times. Irecomend this movie, when making movies like this are forgotten now..truly a gem."
5,True Classic,This was a movie based on a book every school kid way back when had to read. A true classic starring one of the top 5 actors of all time. Spencer Tracy. As only the true greats can do he carries this movie on his shoulders to great success. a must for collectors'
2,That's some Guppy!,"Hemmingway was great no contest.... but just cannot move beyond one guy in a rowboat fighting an 800lb marlin.... and if they had just a more reasonable oppononet like a levithian killer whale (spielberg style) I might buy in, geez, the lilting beautiful descriptions created such a lovely appreciation of being in the sea alone but the visuals completely annihilated any hope of that connection... every time that beeg feesh jumped 12ft the music swells so loudly and seeing Spence just nodding his head to exhibit the physical strength required to actually complete this feat even worsens all of the Hemmingway essence... I doubt his comment about being fat was the worst of his issues, but sometimes the book is the only way to go.... sorry Spence, loved ya in almost everything else..."
2,if fidel watched this hed fall asleep forever,"the chances of anyone making a workable movie out of hemingways novella were slim, and this might count as a noble effort if not for the fact that it is as deadly dull a movie as any ive ever seen. spencer tracy rarely came off as a dullard, but this just doesnt work on any level. A for effort, F for execution."
3,An earnest but uninspiring adaptation,"The Bottom Line:Considering that Hemingway's novel is really not very cinematic this was probably as good a film as could have been made out of the source material, but between the laughable model of the ship and the constant, constant narration by a not-Hispanic looking Spencer Tracy, there's not much to recommend here; the filmmakers get points for their devotion and effort, but they didn't make an especially good film.2.5/4"
5,old man and the sea,This movie is excellent!A true classic done by one of the greatest actors Hollywood has ever had.The transfer from film to dvd is quite good.This is a must have for any classic movie collection.
5,great movie!,"Hemingway's brilliant classic novel, exceptional performances by the great actor Spencer Tracy and others, stunning photography, and brilliant direction all combine to make this DVD a treasure to enjoy again and again."
5,The Old Man and the Sea (DVD),"have allready purchased this item for our students in the Arts College at Ittihad University, Emirates. It is a very useful for practical listening for the students and people who learning English. Dr. Magdy Ziyadah"
4,old man and the sea,"this is a great price for an old school movie about honor and bravery. a clasic for sure. kids, if not out playing (and after homework & choures), should be watching things like this."
5,Melechesh... a milestone in the extreme metal music history,"Melechesh is a band that has succesfully created a new style of black metal. Their new album Djinn incorporates mediterranean melodies with extreme metal music. The whole concept of Melechesh is facinating, from the album title ""Djinn"" to the imagery and lyrics. Each song has a unique touch to it, yet all the songs are mold into a whirlwind of unified identity. The guitarist offer a magnificent array of riffs that are creative and have a Slayerish feel. The drums are performed by Proscriptor (Also drummer of Absu). In Djinn he display his ability to play mediterranian drum structures. This album shall remain in my CD player for a loooooooooong time...."
3,Not like the picture,I wanted this wig so I could be David Bowie from Labyrinth for Halloween. I found this pictured to be the closest I could get to his hair and when I recieved it it wasn't as silvery as it had looked in the picture. Kind of a bummer and I was too afraid to try to style it to be more spiky since it was a cheap price I believed it would be too cheaply made to mess around with the hair too much. A little disappointed but I made it work out in the end.
3,Stock Pot,"the pot is nice, it is heavy and very durable, however, it has a steam control valve on the top of it and it did not come with any insturctions or papers of anykind, I can not find it online because there is no manufactures name on it at all."
1,not too impressive,"I was a little let down after how juvenile the whole thing was. I would probably recommend this book to a girl who's gossipy because it's the audience the book would be of obvious appeal; but I may be mistaken, because being a girl myself, I find the whole thing immature, unrealistic, a let-down, and quite frankly, revolting. I find the whole experience quite horrifying. I would also recommend this book to an obvious feminist, and, in short, someone who hates boys. As for my evidence for the unrealistic material, a girl in the fifth grade would be a lot more mature about matters such as those in the beginning of the book, especially those about being a ""genius"" as a fifth grader. Not too impressive in my opinion."
3,"Good, but not what I expected","This is a great game to buy if you don't own the first Heroes game. However, if you are like me, and have bought the 1st, then you might not want to get this game. The good things are that you can choose the difficulty level on the new campain(something that was sorly needed on AB, and RoE). Also it has a ton of new maps...but other then that it is not all that good. If you think it is worth $30 for it, then buy it. I for one, am glad that I bought that game"
1,Why HOMM3:SOD get's 1 star,"I love Hereos of Might and Magic 3 with the Armageddon's Blade add-on. I find it to be a fantastic turn based strategy game with role playing game elements. The whole game has a certain ""hobby board game"" feel to it as well. This product above is nothing more than the old HOMM3 with a few new terrain sets, 12 artifacts, and a handful of scripted scenarios for the price of $40. This is bad for existing fans of HOMM3. Secondly, NO new monsters, heroes, or buildings are added. Thrirdly, to date, NONE of the new terrains or artifacts work with the randomized map generation (with no plans to implement this according to NWC CSR). Lastly, the game will not work at all if you install HOMM3:SOD with Armageddon's Blade, despite the press releases and what is stated clearly on the game box."
4,For Those who Understand,"The previous review reminds one of someone who was presented with a 5th grade science introduction and then commences to comment on quantam mechanics, celestial quarks, and pervading pulsars. Sorry, but that reviewer should not have read that book. Only those who have a heart for a relationship with the Creator/Beloved God and understand the language of Love are welcomed to come in. Please, don't read the Song of Songs, or Mechthilde of Magdeburg, or Julian of Norwich, or John of The Cross, or Mother Teresa, or Therese of Lisieux, or................enough said!"
1,Ha ! Ha !,Those guys should just do eagles covers and just call it a day.The Ataris will not be missed. Pipebomb !
2,Only buy the single.,"I was interested to see if anything new had happened for the ataris,I heard them years ago on a sampler and didnt think a whole lot of what i heard.After that i just seemed to forget about them.Years past and one day while having a beer and listening to the TV i heard this track,and i was pleasantly surprised.Ive always liked the original but version gave it a little more of a modern feel.Unfortunately its only this song which is any good.Tracks 2 and 3 on the single are your average boo hoo my GF left style stuff and track 4 was......wait for it a Ramones Cover,What the hell were they thinking.If you like annoying Simple planish style stuff grab the album if you dont its only worth buying this single."
4,Excellent.,I have no recordings of Kiel except this one. I will own more. He was a complete surprise for me.
2,TOO TIGHT ! ! !,"When buying these headphones i thought that other people exaggerated saying that the band is too tight and painful. And besides, my girlfriend has a small had... :)Turns out that they were right and she can't put them on :(Superious Koss sound quality though."
5,....,"Wow. After reading positive reviews of the non-headbanded counterpart of these, the ksc-50, I decided I should get a pair. I couldn't find a single pair in stores, and I ended up getting a pair ... I cracked open the package, and tryed 'em out on some Rage Against the Machine, and was pretty well amazed. The only bad thing about 'em is they seem a bit fragile. But thats acceptable for the price. ..."
1,Not worth it at any price,These headphones started falling apart from the minute I took them out of the box. The ear pieces are extremely delicate and not able to handle touch without the foam unattaching itself from the headphone. A real pain.
3,The sound is OK.......BUT.....,Those cheap foam pads that cover the earpiece comes loose much too easily. Other than that....they are not bad for the price.
5,Finally!,"I have looked long and hard for this CD and Amazon happened to be the only one who carried it. I am sold on Amazon and their services. Lighter Shade is a smooth hip hop Latino group that I have enjoyed for years. They have stopped producing albums, so I have started collecting their albums for future listening. Good buy!"
4,case for other items! (leapster),needed a case for a borrowed leapster. This one fit the bill perfectly and was on clearance at Toys R Us. It is rugged and does the job nicely. Holds one cartridge too. Great for trips to grandmas to carry the Leapster Game.
1,"ONLY FOR GABRIEL COMPLETISTS, & THEN ONLY WITH GRITTED TEETH","Unlike the wonderful CD singles that were released for ""US"" a decade ago which harbored really interesting material, this single is just a waste of money.You get the album version of ""Barry Williams"" (why do we need that?), the ""Radio Edit"" of the same (boring duplicity), a Gabriel-less ""Cloudless-Radio Edit"" (with Gabriel's vocals removed, why would it receive radio airplay?), and finally, but very least, an downright annoying, drum-machine-driven remix of ""My Head Sounds Like That"".Small wonder this CD5 has not been made available in the U.S.; perhaps even the record company bean-counters couldn't bear to inflict it on us. What a disappointment!"
3,Leaden oddity,"I'm sure I'm missing something, but why is Peter Gabriel's new radio song called ""The Barry Williams Show""? Is he aware that Barry Williams is the name of the actor who played Greg on the Brady Bunch? There is of course no talk show with Barry Williams in it - is this supposed to be what it would be like if there were? (Unlikely - Williams may have done some lousy shows before, but he isn't Jerry Springer, after all.) Or if ""Barry Williams"" is supposed to be a purely ficticious host of a representative talk show, the name is ill-chosen. Anyway, the song itself is a somewhat mundane but certainly apt attack on horrible television talk shows. The chorus is vaguely catchy and the production is slick, though Gabriel's lead vocal begins with an uncharacteristic rasp to it which isn't very effective. Overall, a rather dark and plodding tune."
4,Barry Williams--the actor,"I don't know if Peter Gabriel was aware that Barry Williams, the actor, played a role on The Brady Bunch or that he even existed when Peter wrote the song, but at least Barry Williams isn't upset--he appears in the video for the track.For those not yet willing to puchase the full Up CD, this is a good introduction to one of the best tracks--a wonderfully satirical look at television talk shows. As Peter said during his concerts, just as you are what you eat, you are what you watch."
3,Too short for the price,"Although I like this stretch, it ends up being only 8 minutes long--a big disappointment, and too short for the price tag."
2,Waste of Money,"I would not waste my money on this, even for $5 you would be paying too much. I am not new to exercise, but I am new to trying to incorporate stretching into my life. This nice lady, who was/is obviously a dancer, has graceful moves but she doesn't give much in the way of instruction or what you should be feeling. Just goes into it and you're like, ""Whoa, so am I supposed to start or is she just showing us a nice little routine and then she'll explain and have us follow it?"" No, you just start moving trying to follow her continuous movements and feeling a bit silly. Also, it is insanely short to me, someone said 8 minutes? That sounds right. Seemed like 5. It does feel nice but I finished it, wondering if I'd done what I was supposed to, wondering if there was more coming (there wasn't) and VERY glad all I did was check this out for free at the library. I would describe this tape as a lovely waste of money if you buy it. It was lovely in a way but I found it mostly useless."
1,Disappointed,"Ann Smith is a lovely older woman who is obviously in great shape, but I am not. I am a senior in terrible shape and needed something I could use at home to help me get on the right track. For reasons I won't go into, I have lived a sedentary live for some time now and hoped her tape would get me started in the right direction. The tape just seems more of an opportunity for Ann Smith to show off and make me feel even more hopeless. I have tried the gyms and have my own set of difficulties and really believed stretching was the right approach for me I still do, but I need someone to start me out at the very BEGINNING and step by step go from there. This tape was such a waste of money and such a sad disappointment. I was so excited and then so terribly let down. Patricia"
2,Interesting,An interesting movie that I needed to watch until the end. Not sure that it is something I would watch again though.
2,Worked for 2 hours,I used this product for my leather snowboard gloves. The water protectant lasted for a few hours then rubbed off. If you touch snow constantly then find another product.
3,Not as great as I had hoped,"It works, but it's a pain to apply and it doesn't work all that well. Maybe because I'm relatively new to snowboarding, maybe i just like to pick up and play with snow. Either way at the end of the day my glove is usually soaked. I thought this waterproofing would help and it did but only a little. The applicator is not very friendly, the product either doesn't come out at all or soaks the glove. I would think a spray would be more convenient."
4,"SO FAR, SO GOOD","I ORDERED TWO CALF SLEEVES FOR PREVENTIVE PURPOSES. I HAVE FRAGILE CALVES AND HAVE SUFFERED FREQUENT INFECTIONS FROM MINOR INJURIES. SO FAR, THEY ARE ALMOST PERFECT FOR MY PURPOSES. ONLY THING BETTER WOULD BE IF WERE AVAILABLE WITH VELCRO WRAPAROUND CLOSINGS FOR QUICKER ON/OFF. ALSO, I WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED IF THEY FALL APART PREMATURELY."
4,ISSIGONIS-MIGHTY DESIGNER FOR MINI CAR,Sir Alec Issigonis was a most interesting person.He grew up in Tuekey.He never saw a car until he was almost a teenager.He saw an aeroplane before he saw a car.In the 1930s he converted an austin car to a rcing car and drove it in races.The book shows the various twists and turns of his career.it also shows his strengths and his weaknesses.For instance he seemed completely obvious of the internal political situation of the companies where he worked.The problems of managemnet of the British Motor Industry are hinted at but not spelt out.Similarly the economics of the mini are not spelt out.Other reading indicate that itv was sold too cheaply.In australia most cars are built using the principles that Issigonis propounded.There are front wheel drive with an east west engine.It is worth while reading the book to see the person who lead the way to how most cars are produced throughout the world
1,invisible-------NOT,This invisible solid is not invisible as it leaves marks on my shirts as putting them on. Also does not do it's job I would not waste my money on this product. Wrote the company and I got no response. I do not like to be ignored.
3,"I liked the texture very much. Rather silky, ...","I liked the texture very much. Rather silky, much nicer than the gel I normally use. My one complaint is that there seems to be a fine line between applying enough so it works and applying too much -- which leaves a mess. After a few tries, I got it right. I would recommend this product to someone who values comfort over immediate ease of use because it feels good against the skin."
3,There was not a big difference between this ...,"There was not a big difference between this anti-perspirant and the brand I use. It did do the job though. I would buy this product in the future, the product did it's job as expected. I would recommend it to someone if they asked."
4,Goes on smoothly. Since it dries clear I ...,"Goes on smoothly. Since it dries clear I can avoid stains on my shirts. Kept my perspiration in check, which my family and co-workers greatly appreciated. I would be happy to recommend this to others."
1,you can judge this book by its cover,"This book is really not very good at all. Looking at the cover you can see the standard of lighting in the book is not going to be great. The examples consist largely of scenes constructed from primitive spheres and cubes and don't go into any real depth...they are so far removed from real-world production problems that it is laughable. This is no surprise when you discover that the author has actually written a book on Lightwave lighting and though his production experience is fairly lengthy, these all seem to be Lightwave productions, as there is nothing within this book to suggest that the author's knowledge of 3ds max is anything but cursory. I think that if the makers of 3ds max saw this book they would be very disappointed that a book is available that makes their great application look so very very bad."
5,Very beautiful!!!!,"Very happy with my purchase!! This ring is very beautiful, sparkly and shiny! Looks like the real thing! Top quality!!!!"
3,lovely,"I was a bit trepidatious about buying jewelry online, but this proved my fears unfounded. It was really beautiful in person. I bought it as a gift for a friend. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the presentation. It came in a tiny plastic ring box which I felt looked very cheap. I bought a real leather ring gift box to present it to my friend, it made it look ten times better."
3,Hit&Miss,"truth be told His best stuff was on the Carnival Album&that is where His Main Hits came from Post Fugees era.""Gone to November"" was tight Original&the Re-Mix with R.Kelly is tight.but after His First Solo Set He went down.""Ghetto Religion"" is a cool cut He did with R.Kelly.still a bit pre-mature for a Greatest Hits on Him though."
1,this sucks!,"a complete waste of money. some of the tracks are actually recorded off of the austin city limits show and sounds like a mic infront of a television set. that's not a joke, I think that's what they actually did. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,Not One Track Worth Keeping,"I purchased this used. The cover looked inviting. I should have read the reviews on Amazon first. The sound quality is poor and so is the performance.I did not rip one track from this CD.FYI, I've collected records for 55 years, and I'm a sometimes deejay."
2,Bad sales!!,"I am a big fan of the Renegade Saints. My only cd got stolen from my truck, right out of my drive way. I had found this cd at a thrift store and wasso excited! Then it was stolen. So finally I got online and ordered a new Fear Of The Sky cd, and i received some promotional copy - not for sale.It only has three songs on it. Delevered,Thin layer,and 1968 (Fear of the sky). $13.00 I spent for 3 songs!!! Thanks alot!!"
1,Critical piece broke off first use,First time that I used the product the metal piece that goes through the grate and actually lifts the grate broke off. Unfortunately the first time that I used the product was AFTER the date for no-cost return of the product (by two days). It will be cheaper to look for other alternatives than pay for shipping back and forth.Would not have expected such low quality from a Steven Raichlen product.
2,Worked well - while it lasted,"It worked fine for handling my 18"" cast iron grate while it lasted.The black parts of the handles were painted wood, not bakelite as the product page states; the paint is flaking off pretty badly after only about 6 months. Granted, it has been stored mostly in an outdoor storage bin, seeing the elements for a night or so every once in a while, but I'm still not impressed with how the paint failed to hold up.The real problem is the spot welds at the base; of the two holding it to the vertical tube, one is burned through the material pretty badly, and the other left hardly more than 3/32"" of material connecting the two pieces - the latter weld is what broke, but the other one is not far behind. In any case, it's now useless after just one grilling season.If you're going to buy one, take a look and sanity check all the spot welds while it's still within the amazon return window - or buy something else that will hold up."
2,cheap,This worked for about a weak with my BGE and then it broke. I finally just ordered the original device with the BGE logo--cost more but it's still going strong!
1,Total Crap,"I bought this because it was recommended/endorsed/whatever by Steven Raichlen. Do not waste your money. This is an overly-engineered product that simply doesn't work. What you need is the old-fashioned type that uses leverage to lift and hold the grill grate. This requires you to insert the thing inside the grate, turn it 90 degrees, release the spring tension, and lift. Sadly, the spring is not strong enough to keep the top and bottom firmly against the grate. This means that when you lift the grate it slides one direction or another. You do NOT want a hot grate sliding toward you! I have tried this on my Weber 22 1/2"" Performer charcoal grill and my DCS Gas Grill. Same result on both. I will trash this and replace it with a Grill Grabber or a piece of wood that I have put a notch in."
5,Love this thing,"This works well at lifting the heavy weber cast iron grids. When I need to throw some more wood chips in the smoker box, or when some flaming piece of food falls down, this device lifts the grid with ease."
1,Great Product but Quality Lacks,This is a great product at least in concept. However the weld at the bottom of the tee is VERY weak. The first one that I ordered arrived broken so I sent it back. Super quick replacement by Amazon. The second one lasted just over a month and then it broke in the same place as the first one. I really love the tool but the company that they use to manufacture or do there welding does a VERY poor job. So my suggestion is do not waste your money on this grill gadget and use a vise grip pliers like I did before and will now continue to use going forward.
5,genious invention!,"very well made, works great. if you think you will ever need to lift the cooking grate while smoking or grilling, you need this tool"
3,not bad but not excellent,"I was a little dissappointed when I listened to this album. Knowing that it won the Mercury Prize, a prize given to some of my favorites like Portishead and Tricky, I expected a really groundbreaking album. I was let down. While Ms. Dynamite is a cut above the average pop female singer/songwriters out right now, this album is a little overrated. I thought that she had a lot of good things to say but the delivery after a while got VERY boring. There are only two tracks on this album that I thought were really good and the rest is average monotonous R&B from a mediocre vocalist."
5,well deserved Mercury-winning debut.,"Before you get this CD, check her debut appearance on the charts on Sticky's 2001 tune ""Booo!"" That'll give you a sense of Ms. Dynamite's natural verbal artillery and ferocity. This 2002 debut was pretty remarkable for a year when UK garage made more inroads in the US (e.g. Daniel Bedingfield, The Streets), but believe me, one listen to this CD and it's pure London. The horns and beats on the my name is track ""Dy Na Mi Tee"" brings up imagery like getting your teeth knocked out by the drunken sot by the Camden Town tube stop, while the tight single ""Put Him Out"" does TLC's '99 ""No Scrubs"" all ragga style. Her vocal style is somewhere between Lady Saw and Kelly Rowland, but it's the match with each track's rhythm, whether it's syncopated or more drawn out, that makes this CD a genius purchase. Rumors of duets with Eminem & Robbie speak to how much other artists rate her work. She even beat out the Doves for a Mercury!"
5,A Perfect Musical!,"Just as Fosse was created by combining his most famous dance numbers, Crazy For You takes some of Gershwin's best songs and combines them to make a musical. Most likely you've heard some of these songs before. I Got Rhythm is one of Gershwin's most famous songs ever. I enjoy Embracable You and They Can't Take That Away From Me as well. If you like musicals and/or you like Gershwin, this is the CD for you. Think of this as Gershwin's greatest hits!"
5,How could you not love this cd?!,"This cd includes some of the best music from Gershwin. Crazy For You is funny, romantic, and the dancing was great. If you missed out on seeing it on Broadway, listen to this cd and get a feel for what the live performance was like. I wish my high school could perform this for our musical. If you were able to see the show, buy the cd already!!"
1,Bootleg,"This is an illegal bootleg release. Buy 'The Complete Bob Marley & the Wailers 1967-1972', parts 2 and 3 (from JAD Records) or Bob Marley & The Wailers albums from Trojan Records instead, if you want to have the songs on this album. JAD's and Trojan's releases are legal, and the sound quality is often much better on their albums. Also, if you buy the box sets from JAD, part of the money will go to the Bob Marley and Peter Tosh families and Bunny Wailer (the three original Wailers)."
4,reggae legend,this cd has bob marley songs that arent that wel recognized but they are still great.the songs are kinda gritty and raw like those old reggae mix tapes. overall good compilation by the king of reggae.
5,Where fiction meets fact,"Joel ably taps his experiences working for such luminaries as Bill Bennett, Rush Limbaugh and Steve Forbes to weave a compelling story grounded in reality. His characters and story know the way around Washington because Joel does, too. One of the best political / military thrillers to come down the Beltway in a long time."
4,The Last Jihad,"Current, political intrigue, small amount of religion. I enjoyed it and the others in the series."
5,The Last Jihad,"This story hits the ground running, with all the excitment and suspense of a fine motion picture. As relevant and thought- provoking as today's news."
2,Rather disappointing,Just not to my taste - too political. I lost track of who was who pretty soon. Thought this would have been a great read after all the postive reviews
5,Great book,Read this book and remember the end is coming and God is in charge of the world we live in. Thanks for the book.God Blessyou
2,"All's well that ends a dictatorship, but...","Please, the Hardy Boys books featured deeper characters. Gene Autry movies had better dialog, and less-contrived plots. I mean, how far can ""timeliness"" carry a novel? Obviously, to the best seller list. But staying power? Long-term interest? I confess that Rosenberg builds some nice momentum with those cinematic quick cuts from scene to scene. Because Rush Limbaugh recommended it, and I like Rush, I give it one star. Because the good guys win, it gets another. Other than that, don't waste your time."
3,Don't go mailing the Pulitzer just yet...,"This was a good book, good, not great.Rosenberg has a flair for detail, in that way, you may say he's much like Tom Clancy. He explains things in a very detailed manner, like Clancy.HOWEVER, the plot here is a little too straightforward. The idea was great, but it seems like that's all he had to work with.His basic idea and then the minute details.It's almost as if it's an outline for a future novel. If Rosenberg had added another 100 pages of straight characterization, he would have made a GREAT first novel.I say three stars, and on that, I'll buy his next novel to see if he improves."
1,Light weight reading at it's worst,"This is a truly awful book. It is poorly written, devoid of meaningful dialog and themed more like a talk show then a novel. It is truly lightweight reading for lightweight minds. It certainly comes as no surprise that it is endorsed by some of our country's most right wing nutjobs (Limbaugh, etc). Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Pretty bad to the point of laughably bad,"If you like thrillers with no heroes, no action, and no plot coherence, this is the book you should read. While it starts off with a bang, even the bang doesn't ultimately make sense. And it starts off with Jon Bennet negotiating a deal, but he ultimately does as close to nothing as possible. C'mon, the good guys are e-mailing each other on their Blackberry's during a gunbattle? How s-l-o-w-l-y can you type s-t-u-p-i-d when bullets are flying?"
1,rather dull reading,"expected more from the reviews, and interesting idea for a plot, but lacks grandoise"
1,Not sure whether to laugh or cry,"I found this book to be another tired propaganda piece to continue manufacturing consent for George Bush's (GOP contributers) expansionist plans. Whether written entirely or partially before the Sept. 11 attacks which we still have no hard evidence with all the foot dragging and cover ups(kissinger..etc), it reeks of bias and hidden agenda.I frequently visit my local independant bookseller in hopes of finding independant and intellectually stimulating material, this was not one. If I had a third thumb it would be 3 thumbs down and a ban on any more propaganda disguised as ""entertainment""."
4,Average unabridged audio,"See story summary above.Other than its timely subject, this came off as a somewhat average thriller. Parts of it made you hold on tight and other parts just kept you lingering.Again I must commend Dick Hill's job at the skill and range in reading these types of novels. He can make an average novel seem better."
5,Brilliant,"A brilliant insider's account of a fictional view of the war on terror. Rosenberg strings together a vivid story of war and intrigue, high-level decision making and betrayal. The story will leave readers on the edge of their seat..."
4,Well done,"I don't listen to Rush, but I still liked this book. It was interesting and exciting. The book caused me to ponder about real life because it is set just a few years from now."
4,Fast moving,"This is a great fast moving introductory book. Political thriller that is dated due to changes in political structure of late, but it is a great adventure."
3,lovely and slow,"I loved this book and am excited to start the next book in the series. It was exciting and full of action. However the parts in between the action were really slow. I would read a page and not remember any of it and had to start again, or even just skip some. It took me almost a week to read, where on average I read a book of this size in one day. Despite the slow parts, when I was finished with the book I was excited to grab the next one."
5,The Christian Tom Clancy,"""The Last Jihad"" is an action-packed thriller full of twists and turns. Joel Rosenberg went through quite a bit of research in order to make this book realistic and to give it a historic background. The plot involves a deadly assassination attempt on the president of the United States. Other attacks are in the planning and/or execution stages. As the U.S. government grapples with the attacks, their ferocity and audacity, behind the scenes are players who are feverishly seeking who is to blame. Rosenberg's ""The Last Jihad"" addresses the fear of a terrorist nuclear attack. Will that one be successful and who is behind them all? To find out, read this excellent book."
4,page turner,This book was written before the Iraq war but after September 11th. It offers a view how a war with Iraq would have gone if Saddam had tried to attack Israel with a nuclear bomb. Very exciting book. I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read his next book.
5,You'll forget which parts were real and which were fiction,"The Last Jihad is called a ""conservative thriller,"" meaning that every once in a while, the author puts in a couple sentences to diss Clinton and Carter and also establish that GW Bush was reelected to a second term. If you can get past these unnecessary jabs then you'll truly enjoy the book.Shortly after the book starts, the reader is immersed in suspense as an assassination attempt occurs on the popular president up for reelection. With great knowledge and detail on secret bunkers and operations, Rosenberg's writing is so perfect that I soon couldn't remember which sections were real and which had not actually happened.The Last Jihad is worth the read.(A little side-note: Anyone else notice that the book begins a day before Thanksgiving while the president is seeking reelection? I thought that Election Day was early November and Thanksgiving is at the end of the month. Didn't anyone in editing notice this?)"
5,A page turner,"This was a fascinating read. Even though I read it years after it was written, it was still newsworthy and insightful. And it was highly entertaining. I had trouble putting it down."
3,An Old Superhero Comic Strip,"Simple, easy reading, with no thinking required. Like reading an old superhero comic strip where the good guys and bad guys are overly obvious. However, it was entertaining like a mindless ""Made for TV"" movie. Have fun reading it, but don't analyze any of it - it's clearly entertainment from the right wing standpoint."
2,Brought to you by the Bush Administration Inc.,"This book is nothing more than a thinly veiled advertisement for the Bush administration's planned war on Iraq. Had I read the accolades on the dust jacket I would have read this book with a much more jaundiced eye, as it happened I did not.The plot is contrived, the characters one-dimensional and the lesson, hammered home relentlessly, is that the good guys can use nuclear weapons and still retain the moral high ground, indeed that we can avoid all this unpleasantness looming in the near future if we'll just get out of the way and let Bush turn Baghdad into a parking lot.I only pray that Bush never reads this."
2,Wave that flag if you can't see past your own eyes.,"I have to admit, this was a great read in the beginning. I was hooked on the initial assault, which served to keep my interest throughout the rest of the novel.The ending ruins this book. With no respect for human life or dignity, I found this preachy first attempt at a novel to fail on all points of accountability. I'm not going to give away the ending, but I will say that the gravity of the situation coupled with a lack humanity leaves the reader saying, ""Really? We did that? Just like that? And all the President can do is sigh?""If you're a fan of anything American, don't read this book unless you enjoy reading extensive methods of how we're just like a bunch of terrorists."
1,The Last Jihad,"Purchased for future reading. Tagged it with 1 star, but there was no other option I could give since I have not read it. S. Robertson"
1,Thinly disguised story making Bush/Cheney into heros,"In Rosenberg's feverish book, copyright 2003, the President and Vice President are given heroic personas - if only that were true. Not only is the economy going great guns but the pair are presented as all-knowing, far/decisive thinking greater than life heros. In adition, Saddam is proven (remember how Bush/Cheney were so certain) to have not only Sarin and other poision gases but actual nuclear bombs with rockets to launch them. Of course, in the book the President has no choice but to launch a massive bombing campaign against Iraq again with no plan of what to do next - just like what happened.Although this is a 'book' where actual events have evolved completely differently, I am sure Christians and Republicans will love its delusions."
3,Wake up America - please.,"The fact that this book has reached number 2 in the Amazon sales ranking (combined with the recent election results) just goes to show the extent to which Americans are buying the US government PR. (not that this book is necessarily) If you want to know what I mean by that, please inform yourself by visiting the whatreallyhappened (dot com) website. If it's not there, (as a result of US government actions to remove it) simply go to google and search for `whatreallyhappened mirror'. Please stop swallowing PR for your own sake and the sake of the planet!If you want a good book on the subject, try 9-11 by Chomsky."
2,Slow and to much religion,I found the book slow. Probably will not read this author again. To much discription of pending events which I found ridiculous. Please do not put my name on this review. Would prefer anonomous.
4,The Last Jihad,Joel Rosenberg knows how to write about the Middle East. He keeps you on the edge of your seat with the action and intrigue. A must read for those who are interested in the developments of the peace process between Israel and Palestine.
5,Put your To-Do List Away,All other items on your to-do list will have to wait once you being this book. Don't be surprised if you find yourself engrossed from the very beginning..and hold on to your socks from there. No matter what your stance is on terrorism and war in the Middle East you need to read it.
3,THE LAST (quick)JIHAD,"The book is obviously written quickly to beat the real time clock ticking over our current difficulties and impending war with Iraq. Therefore, some of the dialog is strained and hard to believe. The premise of the book is interesting and the pace is very quick, making it an easy and enjoyable book to read. It certainly is not the best book on the shelves and in a couple of years it will not be very relevant, but considering the timing and the ties to current events, it was a good read. Rosenberg obviously needs to develop his style a bit if he is to continue writing novels but he obviously has some knowledge and sources in and about government that gives his work realism. I would recommend this book if you read it NOW, before the real war starts."
4,The Last Jihad,A good read. But the best part is it's clean! Don't have to skip the vulgar language. That's important to me.
5,Fast Paced -Couldnt Put It Down,This is an excellent book. Better than Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlam in that it motors along. Most of the plot is quite plausible. Espeically the part linking IRAQ to terroists.PS....The other reviewer who posted a there is no Iraq Terrorist link is delusional.
4,A good first effort,"Timely certainly does fit this book. Some of the scenes in the story could be right off the headlines of todays newspapers. The characters are fresh and for the most part believable and the pace of the story is breathtaking, at least through the first half of the book. I do have problems with the premise that only an Israeli/Arab coalition against Iraq can save the United States. Has our military dry rotted to the point that our survival rests on two factions that are bitter enemies? The author has spent so much time making this book work, making it seem real that such a faulty assumption seems laughable. However, it is a worthwhile read but it doesn't live up to Limbaugh's review."
3,Quo vadis?,"This is a well written book which, in essence, goes nowhere.From a dramatic perspective it might have worked better had the author started at the end and ended at the beginning."
3,It was OK...,"To sum the book up, it was an OK novel. But the reason that I gave it 3 stars was because of the use of blatant product placements throughout the novel. I am not sure if advertisers pay authors to include their products into books but I am convinced that is exactly what happened in The Last Jihad. The product placement's became so obvious that I actually went through the 1st chapter with a highlighter and marked all the product placements that I could find. I think I highlighted at least 30. Some of them are painfully obvious. The only things missing were the Trademark emblems."
5,AWESOME BOOK,"This book is awesome. It is not something I would normally read, but heard it was a good way to get an understanding of what is going on in IRAQ. This book is a must.... if you want to know what is going on. It reads so well you can't put it down !! Be prepared to drop everything, you'll want to finish the book !!"
2,Good Premise but Falls Short,"The author has a good idea in mind when writing this novel. The book fast forwards the world 10 years of the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and how Iraq is making an all out effort to destroy the United States once and for all.However, this story is highly improbable because he paints Hussein and his top officials as religious fanatics. Hussein was not, nor will he ever be, a religious fanatic.Also, his protagonist, Jonathan Bennett, had such a limited role in this book, you couldn't help but wonder why so much time was devoted to him.This book obviously had a very pro-Israel slant and the author was way too preachy throughout most of it."
1,wow!,"If you like reading pages upon pages (and I am not dealing in hyperbole here...) of details about what the characters in the stories are eating, then this book is for you! I won't even go into politics here... but this book is one of the worst I have ever read. Ever. I have read hundreds of books in my lifetime, and this is one of only 2 or 3 that I have left unfinished. I made it until about 20 pages from the end, and even at that point I had no interest in either the characters or the conclusion of the story. Monumentally bad. Congrats! This author couldn't have sent this to his publisher with a straight face."
1,Inaccuracies galore,"I've spent the last few years working on in-vehicle navigation systems; it was new to me that GPS receivers actually transmit back and can be traced, or that anyone has actually digital maps of Iraq in a commercial product...The rest of the book is just as bad. If you want to read technothrillers by someone who really knows what they're talking, read anything by John J. Nance."
5,Absolutely Too Short !,"I read a lot and this book is to me what good dope is to a drug addict. The true high you're always trying to catch! Absolutely riveting in detail and characters. Joel has seamlessly intertwined the past with the future, especially in the characters speech. One example that jumped out at me was when the VP in the book casually throws out the comment ""Big time"". I howled with laughter. I have not quite finished with it yet and this is my first attempt at a review but that is how much I really love this book. Hopefully the first complete sentence on the third page of text will be found out in the near future to be fact.This is a must buy for anyone addicted to the thriller genre!"
4,Well Written!!,"I loved it! Ordinarily I do not read fiction, but this was SO real and up to date. Rosenberg's background, no doubt, adds to the authenticity of his information. I would purchase another of his books in a heartbeat."
1,People are Cardboard Figures,"The writing is great in spots, the action spots. But the intrigue and the political patter are almost juvenile. The author's research seems to be good. Maybe I was disappointed because it was published after we got Iraq in hand. It jarred me to read what the author thought would happen and to know that it was nothing like contemporary history. I'm fighting to finish it by flipping through the parts that make me want to regurgitate. Some stuff in it is really great. But I'm not sure I can finish the thing.Robert ArmstrongAlbuquerque NM"
1,Boring From Front to Back,"The most boring book I have read in 10 years. No charactor development, confusing plot line, its a big Rah-Rah cheerleader book for the Bush administration and its policies. You end up not caring a whit about any of the people here. If you can figure out what the main charactor does to advance the story in this book, you are better than I am. Its like the author wrote the thing in a couple of weeks and got all his media buddies to hype it before the war in Iraq starts. Particularly hilarious is the gun battle at the end where everybody is sending messages to each other on their Blackberries while the bullets fly. Right...... And the main charactor gets an email on his, right at a crucial moment in the battle, that tells him his father has died. I laughed right out loud. Hmm. Maybe its a comedy, that would explain a lot. Don't waste your money.."
1,Advertisement disguised as a novel,"When I began this book, I was slightly distracted by what seemed to be pointed references to brand names and products. As I continued, I was no longer distracted; I was appalled and disgusted. Apparently Rosenberg was looking for some kickbacks from Coke, M&M's, Blackberries, etcetcetcetc, because they are mentioned AD NAUSEUM. That's about all I came away with after reading this book - commercials. Sure, the plot is remotely engaging, but the characters are a bit flat and the dialogue is laughable at times. I zoomed through it and I suppose that has to do with a fast-paced plot. If you're looking for a book that feels like you're being interrupted for a commercial message every 2 pages, this one might be for you. I consider it a waste of paper (and I am also disappointed that it was so highly recommended by sources I held in high regard)."
1,Ridiculously bad,"This has got to be one of the worst books I've ever read. The plot is beyond outlandish, the characters are insipid and without depth, and the ending is so bad I almost cried from laughter. But make no mistake it's not worth reading just to see how absolutely terrible it is, it's more sad and pathetic than it is funny.I only gave it 1 star because it doesn't let me give it zero."
1,to dumb to be fun,This is an unfortunate attempt at a thriller where the good guys make no mistakes and bad guys are fools. The plot runs like a fan letter for Republicans but fails to be either witty or entertaining in the process.
4,Good book,This is a good fiction book. Has a decent story line. Seems to kind of be based on history of our country.
2,Weak Writing - Right Wing Stuff,"This is a book for die-hard ultra right wing - that is a giveaway when you see that the first endorsement on the cover is by Mr. Rush Limbaugh.The book does have its moments and is an interesting read of an alternate world in what is the worst that could have happened if Saddam was not removed by George Bush!.But it falls far short of Tom Clancy type tension/ authenticity as in ""Sum of all Fears"" or factual research of Frederick Forsyth's ""Fist of God"" - the plot seem labored and its strains to justify the glory and honesty of all thats Right Wing - Neo Con.Not that i have anything against Republican Right , but this book tries too hard and fails to smell authentic - it reads more like George Bush's ""I told you so"" diarySo would I recommend it - only if you are a die-hard George Bush fan otherwise your time is better spent on something like ""The Teeth of the Tiger"" or ""The Afghan"""
4,Timely work,"This book is extremely timely and the subject material is of very current interest. The plot seems more than feasible compared to the usual Hollywood fluff approach in handling current events. I would have liked a little more detail on the demise of bin-Laden, but the main thrust was concerning Iraq and the political machinations necessary on our side to achieve the goals being now espoused by our current administration. The author obviously has an inside track on the political level required to understand how the world works. The plot and characters are well-defined and I reccommend this book to anyone who likes both political intrigue and action-adventure."
2,Get a Year's Worth of Propaganda in Just One Book!,"If you enjoy in-your-face right-wing propaganda, this one's for you. Just the reviews on the back cover should tip readers off. Rush Limbaugh loves it, so if you love Rush, you will probably enjoy this. The story line is not bad, though the hero seems implausible, and actually not very admirable. Character development is shallow. The author appears to have technical expertise, which some will find entertaining. I'd rather have my thrillers pure, and undiluted with less than subtle Christian-right rhetoric.Lynn in New Mexico"
1,vapid insipid drivel,"This author was recommended to me by someone who noticed I was reading Daniel Silva. I plowed through the entire book quickly, but only because I wanted to be done with it. I found the black and white, two dimensional quality to be simplified to the point of negligence. It is no wonder this book is touted by the radical conservative icons of Fox news. ""Christians are good and very smart, Muslims are bad and stupid"". Give me a break. I actually dropped the book into the garbage when I was done. The best thing I can say about it is it gave me insight into the fantasy of the extreme right-wing in America.If you wish to read something with a good deal more depth, I would recommend any of Daniel Silva's novels instead."
2,Here be no dragons,"Just a warning that this ISN'T the Joel Rosenberg of _The Sleeping Dragon_ fame. That one also has a non-fantasy book coming soon.On The Last Jihad, I was occasionally swept up in action scenes, but finally disappointed at the mix of characters. The point of view seems to stay fixed on characters who just don't DO that much of substance. The President has Big Decisions to make (and makes them), but we see that from afar. The Wall Street Whiz Kid thread... disappointed."
2,"""G"" Rated Thriller?","What's with Rosenberg? Is he a graduate of Oral Roberts or Jerry Falwell University? Preachy, preachy, preachy! I can see baptist ministers across the country working this story into their sermons (there's no shortage of bible verses here). There's no sex (not even a kiss between the leading characters)and not a single profane word. Gosh, it's Ajax and Lysol squeaky clean! Buy it; your kids will enjoy it. You won't."
5,Excellent!,"After hearing the author speak i couldn't wait to read his book-it was definitely hard to put down! I was inspired by hope along with the urgency to pray for God's miracles regardless of the situation and I continue to receive great benefit from this and other writings by Joel Rosenberg, a man of faith and vision. May God keep him safe and multiply his efforts a hundredfold!"
4,A nice read,"This was a fast-paced thrilled that was easily readable within 3 days. The style of writing grabbed my attention and the next thing I knew, I was a third of the way through the book! The ending seemed like it had wrapped up too hastily, however. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable read, and I can't wait to read the next volume."
3,I'm lost!,"Either I have a very short memory, or the plot of this book is so confusing that I could neither finish it nor enjoy the parts I did read. I can appreciate his clever use of language, but all of the chronological chaos and generational jumps made it impossible to follow the plot of this book. I shouln't pass judgement since I didn't make it through to the last page, but here's some advice if you try--take notes, or at least draw the family tree."
2,Not for Me,"My sister and I who live 800 miles apart are voracious readers and share recommendations. I recently introduced her to Robertson Davies and Barbara Pym and she, in return, suggested T. Coraghessan Boyle. I chose World's End because it won the PEN\Faulkner award. Boy, does she owe me! While I will concede that Boyle is a good writer, this is not a good book. I didn't care enough about the story or the characters to try and get the point or to figure out who was who and how they were related to anything."
3,"great characters, poor ending","t c boyle is a great writer and a great storyteller. However, this is only a good, and not a great book. For the first 3/4 of the story, the characters, message, prose, and story are as addictive as cigarettes. However, after such a great build-up, the resolution(s) left me with a hollow, I-got-ripped-off feeling. Read this book, but read the collections of short stories first."
2,Disappointing,"Having read and enjoyed several of Boyle's other novels, I found this one boring and I gave up on it about two thirds of the way through. Much better is 'The Tortilla Curtain, for example."
2,"A big, long bore; what is the fuss?","I don't get it. I like TC Boyle. At his best his energy and use of language is fantastic. However, after reading Water Music, Budding Prospects and Descent of Man I was unprepared for this. It is b-o-r-e-i-n-g. And d-a-r-k. I know Boyle is dark, but his was too much, too repetitive, etc. I frankly couldn't wait for it to end. I can't believe it won all those awards. Water Music and Budding Prospects are much better."
1,world's end,"Unfortunately,the hard cover edition advertised was replaced w/softcover which I can't use.A full refund was issued but nothing negative to say about the product."
5,local and universal,"This book is all about the struggles of mankind. In a way it is about class struggles, family struggles and life through the generations, but it doesn't read that way. It comes off as a great depiction of two notable dutch families in the hudson valley. It has engaging characters which keep a sort of continuity through the generations. Very well done, and especially interesting if you are dutch, live in the hudson valley region in new york, or have other ties to colonial america or earlier."
2,What's the real mystery?,"This book reads as if it was a good short story, ruined by several hundred unnecessary pages of boring dribble, in as much as it is based on only one idea rather than a gripping plot. I just didn't care that much for the main character, and everytime yet another catastrophy would befall him, I just rolled my eyes back in my head and thought ""come on, get to the point"". Even the fact that P.C. Doherty reapeats stock phrases to describe people and events throughout the book seems to suggest that he had run out of original ideas long before the pages stopped turning. The only real mystery here was how does a book this bad get published?"
4,Great music!,"It had been years since I had listened to this soundtrack, and was pleasently surprised to re-discover these songs! Enjoy!"
5,Great price!,I remember having this on vinyl and wearing it out. I was surprised how inexpensive this cd was. Plus it got to me in one day!
1,Not a good instructional video at all,"While Bill Douglas has the best of intentions, this video just does not give enough information to practice Tai Chi safely. I have been a Tai Chi player for over 30 years, and I have seen students get hurt from the ""non-instruction"" school of teaching. I think it is time for everyone truly interested in advancing the art of Tai Chi to take responsibility for their students welfare, instead of saying ""If it feels right, it MUST be right!"" This is the easy way out. In this day and age, it is crucial for all good Tai Chi instructors to have in-depth knowledge of human anatomy and physiology, physics, including force vectors, energy flow, health benefits for each and every movement, etc. - and both the video and the book do not express any knowledge whatsoever of these crucial aspects of Tai Chi. This is a superficial exploration at best."
4,Insightful!,"Don Middleberg adapts key public relations strategies to the new media landscape, transformed by the Internet and wireless communications. He emphasizes the need for response speed and short-term - as well as long-term - planning, since this new environment changes so quickly as to render the future unpredictable. He outlines techniques for getting buzz, which is now a critical element in effective branding. However, this book cannot help but be affected by the dot-com downfall: Many of its examples refer to now defunct companies, or to those who are in deep trouble (and may well be deceased by the time you read this review). Still, if you overlook the problems that come from writing during the Internet reality-warp, we [...] recommend this executive guide for its solid PR strategies, which although geared for a high-tech world, are firmly rooted in traditional method."
1,Letdown ... big letdown,"I purchased this book because of Don Middleberg's good reputation in the PR field. Put simply, it would be an understatement to say that this book is terrible. Three main reasons for my drawing this conclusion: 1. outdated anecdotes and examples to illustrate ideas, 2. the thrust of the book (i.e., what value you get out of it when finished) is bland and generic at best, and 3. poor writing. Middleberg is definitely a successful PR professional but this book is a stinker for certain - and a big waste of money."
5,The Brave New World of Communications,"The whole world of advertising, marketing, public relations is in a chaotic state. Old rules just don't apply. Lines, hard cut in the corporate and consumer landscape are blurring and for the first time in a century we find ourselves scrambling to define who we are and what we do.I run a firm that provides tactical creative services to the corporate world. Don Middleberg's book makes one thing clear: This is a new millenium for any communications business. Any company that hopes to be heard above the din needs to understand the concepts illustrated in this book.""Winning PR in the Wired World"" sounds a bell... a wake up call.Agile, smart, awake and aware companies can ride the wave or be left behind. Get this book."
4,Strong and Engaging,"Middleberg's work is about using the Internet to achieve the communication goal of an organization. He hardly stands alone in writing about this area. The real trick to success lays in the techniques discussed and how applicable they are. While they're quite useful, I found Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired to be more effective.That said, Middleberg's work has plenty of useful ideas. Given his reputation, though, I expected far more. It's a good book, but it fell a bit short of my expectations."
2,:-~,"In comparison to the previous album ""Impact"", this new album sounds like a weekend recording job. Overall songwriting skill is purely mediocre and immature. Lyrics are self-pitying and childish, corresponding well to the thoughts of an infatuated teenager."
5,"A festive, wholesome resource","The collaborative effort of Marci Mohan, Jeanne Palmer, and Peggy Simenson, Parties With Pizzazz: A Complete Resource For Holiday Classroom Parties is an activity book filled with ideas for games, crafts, costumes, candies, gifts, and more centered around Halloween themes, wintertime themes, or Valentine's Day. Black-and-white photographs embellish the step-by-step instructions for easy-to-plan projects especially suitable for classrooms but also great for family fun at home. A festive, wholesome resource."
1,This is NOT the Original Recording Rereleased,"If you're looking for the original recording this is NOT it.The parts of ""The Boomin' System"" wherein the lyrics are supposed to be ""...pass the Heineken..."" and ""Roll up a fat one..."" are silenced out. The CD is fine other than that; my search continues. <.<"
4,Pretty Good,Good Album Boomin System and one of my favorite songs of all time Around the way girl is on this one I like it so go get it!!!
4,My First Cd Ever,"When I got my first cd player my dad let me pick out one CD5 that is what they use to call Cd singles. And I choose this one, During the years it got lost. I was so pleased to find a copy of it. If you are an old school hip hop fan then you should check this out."
5,Good introduction to Pilates,"3 short (10-minute) workouts. New to Pilates, it is easy to understand the principles from the introduction, and then get started. Do all 3 workouts, and you have worked on toning and strengthening your entire body. Builds strength without first requiring the strength of wonderwoman, and it is all floorwork (minimal sweat; important if you have a busy lifestyle, or choose to do the workouts as part of your morning routine). Make sure you have a somewhat cushioned floor space. I used a folded blanket on my hardwood floor. Recommended as a good first step toward achieving fitness goals."
1,Not for the injured or out of shape,Too many advanced moves. She has you do situps without bent knees (bad for backs). Not for beginners.
3,Not Bad,"I really like the way that Pilates can help you attain a leaner look within a short amount of time. The instructor in this video is calm and very helpful which can be beneficial if you're new to Pilates. I liked the timer at the bottom of the screen. That's an added bonus.Although health professionals are now insisting that we fit a full hour of exercise into our busy days, the bottom line is: who's got a full 60 minutes to spare? This tape gives you a quick Pilates fix in ten minutes - or, if you have a whole half-hour to spare, you can do all three programs back-to-back."
3,too short,I liked the moves and how they were broken up into 3 10 minute segments. But I din't feel I really worked out. It's better if you do the whole tape. There wa not much of an upper body work out either.
1,"too short, instructor is not good","the video had potential, but Tracy York did not impress me in this. She is kinda like a Denise Austin wannabe, and that bugs me. She is not at all genuine to me, overlyperky and annoying. I liked her other stuff, but this workout is terrible."
5,Better than the White Party,"DJ Brett Henrichsen's debut CD is genious and a perfect example of his signature style of high energy vocal club music, creatively mixed. After attending this year's White Party, we left wishing DJ Henrichsen had spun every party. His Closing Party set was the highlight of the weekend, and this CD is a sampling drawn straight from that legendary set. The CD includes all of the current dance hits, with many extended mixes previously unavailable to the general public. In fact, a few of them will most likely be songs you've been dying to find but didn't know the name or couldn't find them anywhere - especially Agnelli & Nelson's Embrace, which is perfectly mixed here right after the haunting and most requested anthem ""Bobby."" Definitely a must buy CD. I can't wait for the next disc from this new DJ star."
5,Well worth the money: cover price $17.95,"It's a shame that there are no newer editions out but this sturdily bound and nicely sized book seems to hold up against information I have found on various websites. Written by a long term resident of Chiang Mai, it is useful for a short visit or a long stay. There is a newer edition coming out next year. However, you should be able to get an edition from the author if you google for his email address. This books make the internet information search much much more comprehensible as does Nancy Chandler's map. I recommend both products as worth buying and genuinely useful."
1,Very poorly done,"Waste of my time. There are so many well produced videos on WW II. This is definitely not one of them. As a 45 year production company, we'd be embarrassed to have this product on the market. Repeating ""My Way"" music? Go figure. Hope the royalties were paid. Write up on Amazon should not be allowed as it misrepresents what the video content really is."
5,Ether mechanics,"The subject of this book is Ether and how it can be conceptualized and manipulated. Good fundamentals in this book with diagrams. With some of the ideas, you might be motivated enough to start building some small experiments to prove out the ideas. This book is an excellent companion to other books on the subject."
4,In the correct wake,"In pleasing contrast to the majority of mainstream depictions of Darwin's activities on the Beagle trip, Keith Stewart Thomson's travelogue contains very few historical errors. At least when it comes to the actual whereabouts of Darwin in South America. Thomson's presentation of Darwin's ideas on organic evolution is a bit more foggy, but that matters little as the main focus of the book is to retrace Darwin's anchorages in South America.The read is easy, nicely contrasting today's luxury of modern oceangoing sailboats and Darwin's cramped accomodations in the tiny HMS Beagle over 150 years earlier."
2,'techno' arrangement gets in the way of the music!,"I didn't know what to expect from this CD. But my first reaction was, especially when the first piece was Bach, that it was one of those hooked-on baroque music productions. Other compositions were interesting but these techno arranged classicals were mediocre at best. It was a bit 'cheesy'. However, if you rarely listen to instrumental music, you just might enjoy this CD."
5,Talent AND looks...it hardly seems fair :),"Vanessa-Mae brings the 'old' music to life in ways that the composers probably only ever dreamed of. If you need to get some mind-numbing work done, listen to the 'violin player' to get your 'up-and-at-'em' juices flowing..."
5,VANESSA MAE ROCKS !,"I bought this CD about a year ago and I still get chills every time I hear it. She has such a fun,lively sound that you would have to be dead not to enjoy it.And although I would not label this CD as classical music, it is still beautiful and inspirational.She will always be one of my favorite musicians."
3,A Walter Murphy for the '90s,"Back in the seventies, Walter Murphy had a huge hit with a disco arrangement of Beethoven's Fifth. Vanessa-Mae is at her best when she takes the same approach - grabbing a familiar melody and taking it somewhere it's never been before. ""Toccata and Fugue in D minor"" is the standout, climbing peaks that many traditional recordings can't reach; it's fun the way a good roller-coaster is. (If you don't recognize the song title, imagine a caped ghoul in a horror film playing the organ ... it's the song filmmakers always use.)Unfortunately not much else on the album is up to the same standard. Except for ""Contradanza"" and ""Classical Gas"", most of the songs are film-soundtrack quality - they're striking while they're on, and you can't remember them when they're over. Too bad there wasn't an EP."
1,Terrible.,"This is a terrible album and those who classify it as classical music, know nothing of classical music. It is unbelievable that it became so popular. To hear people call this the album of the century is depressing. The arrangement of Toccata and Fugue is absolutely HORRID! The rest of the music sounds like new age mood music that tries very hard to sound like Jean Luc Ponty.This album is garbage and it makes me sad to see that so many people believe that this is classical music. It is too difficult to put how terrible this album is into words. I guess I will stop here."
5,Musical Prodigy gives Jazz Album of the Century!,"A great album full of contemporary pieces and new life to classical ones!If you love Bond, you will see where they were inspired. Vanessa Mae uses her expert violin playing to jazz up the album. Very relaxing yet inspiring, the CD will be a great addition to your CD collection.The highlight is her arrangement of ""Tocatta and Fugue."" The famous piece is been given a rebirth through her strings and is an upbeat piece that will get your toes tapping and arms flailing like a composer's.A great album for your collection. Adds culture to your tastes."
1,This is a worthless piece of junk!,"I have been listening classical music for more than 15 years. She may thrill you with ""modern"" and other ""non-conventional"" sound, but I find it completely meaningless. When I first heard her, I was completely shocked by the lack of any structure and coherent idea. I think her technique is pedestrian and her understanding of music is nothing more than childish. The only thing that she seemed to care about was the circus-like performance and the idiotic cheering audience. If you are into modern styles, I would recommend Nigel Kennedy. His style is not only modern, but he has a remarkable talent and understanding."
1,Far from beautiful violin music,"This is not pretty violin music, and I love violin music but this is no exeption."
1,Slop from a slapper,"This terrible and dull album launched the career of √úber-nothing violinist, Vanessa Mae.It is hard to describe the depth of the level to which this album stoops to be ""popular"". Low brow? You bet! Exploitative? Oh yeah! Dumbed down Classical Music? Well, that's what we've got here!Value of this album? Hard to say. I am sure that Vanessa's parents and agent are happy with this prosaic product.Very dumbed down dumb music - for the legions of philistines and musically naive of the world.In one word, a ""dud""."
3,"Interesting story , but was the editor asleep?","This story is based on the horrible murder of 5 members of 1 family. Much of the story apparently is from the journal of the murdered mother Mary Coulson. Perhaps the thing about this book that drove me wild was the inconsistencies in referring to the black sheep son, Bob. He is called Coulson while the rest of the family members are called by their 1st names. Then at other times, he is called Bob. Yes, the author's bias is apparent from the start, but this book needed a stronger editor not only to help pull the story together, but to do some basic proof reading. I also wondered why Bob was seen coming out of his sister's bedroom in the early morning hours."
1,Worst book I have ever read,"First off, I had no previous knowledge of this crime, I decided to read this book because the back cover promised a ""shocking diary"" kept by Bob Coulsons adoptive mother amongst other things.Well guess what? The diary is mentioned in maybe 2 paragraphs in the whole book. You don't get any insight into the relationships of these people. You only get a quick rundown of the parents. There was a few minor ""scandalous"" behaviors, like the two sisters getting pregnant before marriage, but other than that, nothing.There was no in depth bio about who Bob Coulson was, nothing about his past, except that he was adopted at a young age. The only reason he killed his family was for the inheritance. I have no doubt that he did this awful crime but i think there was a lot more behind it. Why couldn't the author have dug a little deeper?The book was written horribly, at an extremely fast pace, and there were no ""shocking photos""."
2,Minimalism...,"The book ""Ashes to Ashes"" is an under-developed typical true crime book that we are so used to seeing today. Little effort was put into it. I can't recommend the book. It was just OK. You will be disappointed if you buy it.On a happier note, Bob Coulson was executed for his crimes. He was one mean SOB."
2,ashes to ashes,This book was ok book. I could like more history on the family. And more about why his parent wasn't there and why he was only the bad one.
1,Don't waste your money,I cannot express how bad this book is. If I could rate it less than a star I would. I knew the people and was close to the case. This is a work of fiction with no regard as to how the deceased peole are being slandered or what effect it might have on those left behind.
4,Replacement battery,"As a battery, it does exactly what it is supposed to. This replacement worked fine. But HP computers and batteries have, in my experience, a tendency to overheat."
2,Good for Sub Sea Pipeline literature,"An excellent Book on the subject , both in terms of the philosophy laid out and the mathematical treatment.A good and up to date bibliography.Fair coverage of the subject with required emphasis on requisite topics.Clear and easy to comprehend presentation.A good blend of theoretical and practical engineering aspects involved, just what a typical working engineer is looking for!Good both for the advanced student and professional.A welcome addition to the sub sea facility engineering."
2,"Product OK, seller not.","The product was interesting, as expected. It covered many more topics than I thought it would.But the seller said it was new, when it definitely was not. A previous owner signed the inside cover. And there were many places inside that had text underlined, sometimes whole paragraphs. I knew that the book was an old edition, probably shelf worn. But it was advertised as new."
1,FAILURE OF PACKAGING,"Purchased from Walmart, when I tried opening the tube, the plastic top would not release. Then, when I finally did get it free, the vacuum inside sucked the nozzled top up with it. This led to some of the contents being drawn out as well. Now, when I turn the knob to lift the deodorant through the nozzle, it does not work well. I get too much deodorant. Any ""body"" else having this problem? And. . . . how can i reach P&G; to get a refund?Jack"
3,The one feature I liked best about the ...,"The one feature I liked best about the Secret deodorant was the """"going on clear"""" feature, since there wasn't any flakiness. I didn't particularly care for the scent, though, and was aware of it throughout the day. I normally use an unscented product and really prefer that. I also experienced a bit of stickiness at times during the day, which doesn't happen with the product I regularly use. I would suggest that friends try it if they like the scent, since the """"on clear"""" feature is nice. I just happen to not like scented deodorant for myself."
3,This album sounds too much like a rehash,"I loved Trancendence and was happy to see a new CD by Tulku. Having listened to it three times now, I have to admit it's just a bit dull, with the exception of a couple of cuts. It sounds like a revamp of Trancendence, but without the imagination."
5,John channels Johnson,"This CD is so good, so raw and real, and so much in the spirit of Robert Johnson that Eric Clapton should be ashamed for thinking he could do better. You can practically taste the dust being kicked up while Johnson (er. .. Hammond) stands at the Crossroads waiting for an appointment to sell his soul to the Big Red Guy. It's not derivative. It's a heartfelt and down to the bone interpretation. Get this CD if you want to see Hammond channel the soul of Robert Johnson"
5,Perfect,I had a mother of pearl bracelet with rectangular stones/shells and searched for the perfect earrings to go with it. These are about an inch long and match perfectly! Love them. Shipping was speedy.
1,talk radio,"Forget the product review above. I own almost every BLACK SABBATH cd. What the back of the package refers to ""limitations of the original film recording or the source material"" wasn't a problem at all. What I saw of the original source material was great, the over play of words and vids were junk. IF you like documentaries with little music, this may work for you, but if you thought someone could play a song then do the interviews than a song, and not screw up the songs, this ain't it. You may blast me for rating this at good if offered at 80% off list but, I wanna play the song then fast forward through what the drummer was thinking while high; or better, use the skip button or chapter marks to get right to the live music footage. To recap; this is strickly a documentary."
3,any other copy of this album is good,"all the other ""master of reality"" albums are good on amazon accept this year or make, tracks 7 and 8 are mixed up and theirs an extra track called embryo that comes from no where, its worth it to buy a more legit copy for like 5 bucks"
4,A Rugrats Night Before Christmas Review,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter, a big Rugrat fan, loves this book. It's a take off on the traditional ""Night Before Christmas"" tale, but is told from Tommy's perspective. As such, it doesn't always use correct grammar, but it's an easy read with a nice rhyming pattern and has colorful illustrations. Our favorite part is when Tommy refers to the reindeer as ""doggies with sticks on their heads."""
1,Only Vol 3 - not the Complete Works,"The title is very misleading - the Complete Works of Robert Burns - when actually it is only Vol 3 of the complete works. The book itself is interesting, but covers only the final third of his life works and is mainly his letters. What I wanted was, indeed, the Complete Works. For a paperback, and only one volume, it was very pricy. Now I have to go hunt down the other two volumes, which apparently Amazon do not have."
4,Review of the FP Kid Tough MP3player,"We got this MP3 player for my 4 year old daughter,and she absolutely loves it. It is easy to use, well made, and perfect for little ones to be just like the ""big kids"". It came with a few stories and songs and was very easy to download additional music off our CD's. My only complaint is that the volume adjust could be a bit louder as it was harder to hear when using in a loader environment like a car."
3,Fun.,"This product is very durable and great for car rides. The only problem I am having is being able to download music onto it. It does not seem to be compatible with my Vista which now makes it sort of a waste of money. It does come with a few songs, which my daughter has been able to listen to."
3,Vet says to keep using until dog is 1 year old,"Our dog does not like it at all. Had to buy some sprinkles (beef liver) here at Amazon to make our8-month old, 18 lbs Terrier mix to like it. And even then it takes her a long time to finish a cup of iton a twice a day feeding. She does get a few treats in between so that could be messing it up.Our vet recommends it so have to view it like vegetables to a child. It's good for her even ifher tongue and taste buds disagree.UPDATE: 01/15/2013[...] only rates Science Diet-puppy as 2.5 stars. We mixed it with Eagle Pack dog food-Puppy which is rated 4 stars in same website and our dog loves the combination (50/50). She eats it fast and we do not even have to put the beef liver sprinkles anymore."
5,Yummmy!!!,"Both my girls love this mixed in with their food. (I'm sure they'd love it more NOT mixed with the kibble, but they tolerate the kibble just be eat this.)Great service, reasonably priced. I'd gladly use seller again."
4,Sensitive singing; Good literature,"Kudos to Stephen Darlington and the Christ Church Cathedral Choir for producing a CD with a sparkling variety of choral Christmas works by Holst and Walton.The choir's singing is very sensitive - much attention is given to phrasing, diction, balance of voices, and timbre.Excellent CD."
3,Oldy but goody,"This movie is an epic love storie,and i love the chemistry between the two actors in the movie!taye diggs is so sexy!"
4,It's cool!,"No wonder the younger guys like older women. Makes ya wanna go to Jamaica. It's a feel good film, with beautiful photography. Makes you wanna be a younger older woman that still'got it'. It has friendship, style, laughter, sadness. It's a film that will never get old and one that you will always watch just to feel happy. I had a hard time finding this movie anywhere on DVD."
5,BEST MOVIE,"I received this movie in excellent condition, and promptly. This is indeed my best movie of all times. I have seen this movie at least twenty five times, and I can watch it over, and over, and over again."
3,I thought Angela Basset was so HOT in this movie...,Angela Bassett is awesome in this movie.. I mean.. her physical appearance is stunning.. If you buy the movie just to look at ANGELA.. you made a good choice.
3,O.k. but not quite as good as it could be.,"I was really disappointed with this movie. The screen play was awful, but the acting saved it from being a total waste of time. Angela Basset and Taye Diggs act very well in this sexy movie. However, it just does'nt cut it in the end."
2,Hmf,"Here's how Stella got her groove back, she went on an escapist vacation and had some SEX, end of story. Not much news here."
4,Get Your Groove On!,"For those of you who believe in love no matter the age difference, How Stella Got Her Groove Back will keep you coming back...again and again! While I don't agree with every scenario and some of it is a bit hard to believe (but hey, can't a person dream?), I can undeniably relate to its contribution to society. It is well written, and Angela Bassett (Stella) and Taye Diggs (Winston) do a wonderful job making their characters believable. This movie makes you want to hop a flight to the Islands for a little fun and relaxation of your own! Complement your purchase of the movie with the novel; I hear it's even better!"
1,What Groove?,"Maybe this movie should have started where it ended. A single mother, successful career woman takes a vacation in Jamaica with her best friend. Has a fling with a younger man, comes back to New York to loose her job, her best friend dies, her fling comes to NY, and her family is set against their relationship. And somehow she's getting her ""groove"" back.Where's the up swing in this movie? So, I tried to overlook that crucial flaw, I really tried to like this movie, but to no avail.Taye Diggs as a 20 yr. old was unbelievably stiff and contained. Where is his zest for life, the energy and vivacity of a 20 yr. old falling in love for the first time. His performance was dull and uninspiring. The same goes for the chemistry between him and Angela Bassett.Too many holes, too many flaws to point out, but it would mean reliving those forgettable scenes. This movie is like a plane that had it's nose up. It revved up its engine, but it just never took off."
2,It was a so so movie and definitely better than the book....,which I never could manage to finish because it was so boring. The only saving grace(s) in that movie were Whoppi Goldberg and I throughly enjoyed Regina King. Glad I never actually bought the video. It would be on my video case collecting dust. Oh yeah the pajama party was funny but the rest was so-so.
2,Really deserves 1 STAR....,"Okay, so I was really dissapointed with this movie. The only reason why i gave it two stars was because of Whoopi Goldberg and Taye Diggs. This film was long, drawn out, mediocre acting, and borderline offensive. It could have also been about 40 minutes shorter, but I suppose the screenwriter felt adding three more endings would be worthwhile. what annoyed me was the entire tone of the movie, it was so angry, resentful, it was a display of horrible values. I didnt see any love. The writing was poor. It was an insult to the acting and talent to the wonderul actors and actresses inb the film. I cant even explain how I feel about this film...So anyway, dont waste your time...."
2,movie,I purchased this movie from a Amazon seller and right now am trying to resolve the issues I have...
2,Not great,"I was really excited to see this movie, but as it turned out, it was just ok. If I hadn't expected more, I probably would have given it three stars, but the entire movie probably could have been done in about half an hour. Sorry to say I regret this purchase."
4,Given As A Gift,I ordered this film and gave it as gift to my daughter. All I can say is that sheenjoyed it very much.
2,The book was better,"This movie has a promising start, but falters midway through. Where the book was entertaining and fun, the movie changes the story to insert dramatic subplots that did not exist in the book and make it more of a downer. Also, the picture on the cover promises much more Jamaica than is delivered - the movie does not focus on Jamaica as much as the book did, which minimizes its escapist potential. The casting is excellent and the acting good, and there are many funny parts, but on the whole the movie is simply average. Wait for it to come on TV, but don't spend your money on it. Buy the book instead and take it to the beach."
4,An entertaining romantic comedy/drama.,"Angela Bassett in a winning performance since What`s Love Got Do With It. Bassett plays Stella a hard high class working woman in the city and forget something in her heart, how to really live. Her friend Delilah(Whoopi Goldberg in a fine performance) ask Stella to come with in Jamica to new start in life. Stella did change her sense of living meeting a young man half her age, played by Taye Diggs(Go, House on Haunted Hill) in a standout performance. When she falls in love him but everybody telling Stella is wrong to fall in love with a man half her age.DVD`s has a great flawless widescreen transer and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround is also great. An very good movie and worth buying to our collection. Grade:A-."
2,This Movie Was Not Very Good!!,"HUH!! This movie was very boring!! I thought that this movie had a stupid script, and not the best acting!!"
2,A waste of true talent...,"the book was so much better and the book wasn't all that great!!! that is how bad this movie is.. a huge waste of Angela bassetts' talent. she is an amazing actress. her and taye diggs's looks are what get my two stars. this movie is so long!!!! an hour could have been cut out and you would still have a whole movie. i dont' remember the book being this boring.. read the book, skip the movie is my advice..."
2,Wasn't what I expected...,This film was not what I expected. It was so plain. I was about ready to turn it off.Others may like it though.
2,Starring Angela Bassett,"Had this mediocre movie been cast with white actors, it would probably never have been made. Another advance in African-American filmmaking: earning the right to be commonplace. The characters, plot, dialogue are so unconvincing and unbelievable that, were it not for the stunning Angela Bassett, the film would have probably gone unnoticed. And Whoopi Goldberg wastes yet another part that a genuine actress could have illuminated."
2,very average at best,Angela Bassett is a great actress.but this film doesn't work.Taye Diggs is a okay actor but there's no real Chemistry between him&Bassett.Whoopi Goldberg gives a good performance.but it's Regina King that steals the show.she has to be if not the most then defintely in the top 3 most UNderrated Actress's in Hollywood.
5,Beautiful!,Wonderful purchasing experience. Beautiful quality. Prompt service. Would definitely purchase other items from this seller in the future.
3,Mandatory read for school...,Easily understood first hand accounts of heart disease. The large print is ideal for those with vision changes but overall this is not a book for the scientifically minded person.
2,Ottmar's 2nd Chrsitmas album,I was very disappointed with this CD. It did not have the zing of the first album.
5,Gripping Reality,"I was a year behind Smith in high school and lived through the murder in Amsterdam. I found the book to be straightforward and factual, a fascinating look into a strange mind. Knowing the positive side of Smith as a fellow student and club member made it all the more enlightening and puzzling. This book would be an excellent choice for required reading for criminal justice majors."
4,Lemuel Smith Review,"As one of the Special Prosecutors who prosecuted Lemuel Smith for the Donna Payant homicide, I found this book to be both accurate and chilling. Smith was truly the ""essence of evil"" who showed no mercy to his many victims.The book is very well done."
4,Shingle clips need help,I haven't had to turn these on yet but have a similar cable over our garage that has worked well since we moved in 4 years ago. However the clips that attach to the shingles do not hold and the cable migrated to the gutter. Having just installed addition cable on my and neighbors roofs I used silicone and nails through the clip to secure it. We'll see how it holds this winter.
3,Can it be used on Metal Roof's ?,"After receiving the items, reading their instructions, then going to company's WEB site. Product is really not recommended for METAL roof's."
2,ice and frozen gutters,Easy Heat ADKS-300 60-Foot Roof Snow De-Icing KitThis stopped working before the first year I had it .Now it is frozen in my gutters. I had to call Pakistan and I sent pictures. They wanted me to hire an electrician. Amazon has a 30 return policy and I'm still waiting to hear back from eazy heat . It worked great for the first month and was off all summer. I think they should last more than a few months.After persistance the company sent me a new one.Thanks
4,easy intall,have used these for two years to prevent ice damming until i replace my roof. i would recommend this product.
3,Check all requirements first,"This is more of a before purchase warning. There are a number or physical and electrical requirements (some more important than others) that you should be aware of before purchase. I my case it wasn't until I received the product that I found that ""ADKS cable cannot be used on slate, stone, metal and ceramic roofs"". I would suggest downloading the ""ADKS Roof and Gutter De-Icing Owner's Manual"" available on the Emerson Industrial website before purchase."
3,Most of them work,"I have 4 of these on my roof. Three of them work fine, the 4th is a 160-footer that worked great last winter but doesn't work at all now. Since I don't know if maybe I damaged it this summer when I took it off to do some roofing work, I'm not condemning it outright. In fact, I'm here to get another one to replace the fault/damaged one. I'll let you know how that works out...By the way--in spite of the fact that Amazon has been shipping stuff to me here in New Hampshire for 10 years, they still show me in Albuquerque in these reviews. The roof deice cables are in New Hampshire, not New Mexico."
4,Ice roof melting,It takes a little effort to get cables situated correctly on roof to get maximum melting benefit of future ice jams. It did solve my problem of accumulating ice with 90% reduction of ice collecting on roof and gutter.
5,no more damm ice,"this is a replacement for the one I took down 5 years ago. the one I took down was at least 20 years old and did not even look as good as this new one does when it was new. so far no damm ice , then again its only september! I am very confident this will work in Jan.& Feb. to keep my valleys& gutters free of ICE DAMMS or damm ice!"
2,Died after a year of use ... still had ice dam but not back flowing into house,"Worked fine the first year ... however, still had a small ice dam going, but it did not back up into the house. Used in combination w/ a 12 ft. roof rake.Turned it on this year, nothing. A lot of money to have to replace each season. Too bad Frost King no longer makes these cables ... had one on the back of the house that lasted years."
3,"Here's link to installation instructions, including length calculations.","I ended up getting the wrong cable length despite my planning efforts, so am returning it.So my 3 star rating is meaningless since I didn't actually use it - I just had to give a rating to post this.Here are links (at least until they change their website) to the brochure and instructions to guide you through length calculation, and cover other issues you might not have thought of.[...]Click ""product downloads"" near the bottom of the page to download the brochure, instructions for cable, and optional regulator that can go with it.edited:They took the link out but I put it in the 1st comment."
1,"Installed cable this summer, but now that it's needed, it's not working","I purchased this product after a horrible PA winter last year. Ice dams caused extensive damage to our family room and the room was basically rebuilt including the exteriors walls. I placed this product on the roof this summer (and I'm scared to death of heights but I finally got up on the roof). I made sure the cable heated up before and after placement. Well now that the snow is coming down and the gutters are full of snow, I turned on the cable and NOTHING. The cable is covered in snow. No signs of any heat. I've checked all the electrical connections. I have power at the GFCI and good ground per an outlet tester. Now the dilemma, I basically have an ice dam maker installed on my roof and in my gutters! The weather is bad, I can't get up on the roof now nor should I attempt to remove everything from the shingles while it's frozen. This is a worse nightmare than not having anything on the roof!"
1,Product did not work,Installed and tested in the fall. Turned it on in January and nothing. Checked power and other possible problems then called the company. They were not helpful. I would not buy this product again.
2,Watch your electric bill!,Just be careful to watch your electric bill when you turn this on. Raised mine 90% ($325) in one month. Immediately unplugged. The snow was not melted very far from the wire either. Very disappointed after the cost...
4,Ice damming,"Easy to install with a little planning. Take your time and it is nearly invisible.Do NOT order extra clips; it comes with plenty!Last winter very mild, so THIS winter will tell the tale."
5,Everything as advertized. A lot less expensive than the local stores.,"Easy to install, more than enough mounting clips. Works GREAT. Easy to follow instructions. Make sure you have a good layout of how you want it on the roof before you start or you will either run short or have too much cable left over."
4,Happy customer,"Although I haven't had any melting snow yet to create the possibility of an ice dam, I did test it to make sure it heats and the product appears to be exactly as I expected."
4,Easy Heat Kit,"The cable is pretty easy to install. All hardware that is needed to install is included. The clips grab the underside of the shingle pretty well if you pull on the clip at the same time you press down on the top side of the clip with your other hand. Probably sounds confusing but when you get going on the project I think it will make sense. You are trying to make the teeth on the clip bite into the underside of the shingle.The cable works well and melts the snow to keep the water from freezing. If you have a switched outlet near the location of the cable it will make it easy to turn on when needed. One minor complaint the wire comes tightly coiled, which makes it unruly to work with in cool weather. I suggest you plug it in for a while to warm it and uncoil and stretch it out prior to beginning the installation."
3,"These cables work, but they have their limits...","Length:: 2:30 MinsThis season (2010 / 2011) these cables just weren't able to deal with the heavy snow and frigid weather. That said, the ice dam wasn't as bad as I would have had without the cables. They're still worth having, just not the ""perfect"" solution for extreme weather. (See video for more info.)"
4,Snow melt cable,"With 12+ inches of snow on the roof and 20 degree temps I turned on the cables for the first time. To my amazement, the snow is melting and running down the gutter! Seems to work as stated, I don't anticipate any ice dams this year!! I have a wood shake roof, not easy to attach cables. I used roofing nails through the clips."
1,NEVER EVEN TURNED ON!!!!,I purchased this in september and installed it on my roof. Finally turned it on after some big snows here in Cleveland. Has not melted any snow or ice in my dams and gutters. I climbed up on my roof to see what was happening and the coil is not even warm; in fact is cold!!!WHat a piece of junk!! I want to return to Amazon but it will have to wait to Spring when I can take the coil down. \Does anyone out there know to leave a complaint to amazon outside of this review forum??
2,Ok with small amounts of snow.,With big snowfalls it ends up just melting over the cords and refreezing at night. This is probably better suited for a more mild winter enviornment - not Minnesota.
3,good product,Got it for almost half of what it cost at the local ACE Hardware. Will NOT melt ice. Just prevents ice from forming.
4,chants,"It can be relaxing listening to the chants, especially if your anxiety is up. I plan on getting another one."
4,Benedictine Chant,"This CD is very pretty. A nice CD to play around Easter time, which I did. The voices blend beautifully making it great for a meditation practice, massage, or even for yoga during asana time or even final relaxation."
5,Chant cd - Monk chant,"Amazon Verified PurchaseI was very pleased to hear that the singers are Monks. male. This is just what I wanted. I love the music and play the cd soooooo often. The music is soothing and I have it as background sound - and play it at night when I go to bed. What better situation could I have? Now I need a cd of Sisters (females) to round out my collection. As you now know, I am absolutely happy with this cd, it is just the length that I should be."
5,These Monks Are Good,"Mesmorizing, transporting, entrancing...the Benedictine monks can chant. These selections are highly spiritual and can lead to contemplative, meditative state when played at low volume."
2,Not your usual Kyrie,"CHANT arrived in good condition ahead of the promised delivery date and for a bargain price. The singing is well done. However, I never recognized one selection of the ultra long list of chants that are a radical departure from Kyrie Eleison and Magnificat anima mea. I played it while in bed and drifted off to sleep even after being kinda disappointed in the selections. This is not saying YOU won't be transfixed and inspired by the rhythm, melodies, and selections chosen by the totally-dedicated monks."
3,"good, but there are better choices","While this is a good collection & the most well-known, there are actually much better choices. For example, there isLost in Meditation: Meditative Gregorian Chants, Vol. 1by Cappella Gregoriannawhich is a far fresher recording with far more ambience & natural reverberation. Plus, it is about half the price as this one, which was originally recorded in the 60s & then remastered. I find this one a tad dry (& also without as much variety) compared to the ""Lost in Meditation"" collection. Another very good one is Mysteria by Chanticleer which has a lot of variety & excellent sound recording. (though I would still rank it lower than the Capella Gregorianna one, because some selections also sound less full, as if they were recoded in studio & not a large cathedral)"
5,Gregorian Chant Staple,"I listen to a lot of gregorian chant and this album is one of the staples of my collection. If you are looking for soothing, consistent chant, with no instrumentals, then you should seriously consider this CD. Also, the recording quality is good (something that is not replicated in Chant II, which is done in front of a live audiance)."
1,Bad luck,"The music was great, but the CD was damaged to the extent it wasn't possiblr to listen to it. Got returned."
5,Good album,This is my favorite album from them. The music is very soothing and comforting on a stressful day. I enjoy it.
2,No cliche left un-used,"This movie starts out OK. It's well filmed and has a bunch of solid British actors, some of whom were quite young here but went on to great things.The plot is also intriguing, there aren't many movies about the activities of the Long Range Desert Group.But the downside? The music, what there is of it, is the worst of British military movie music. There is one tune, and it sounds like a march played on a parade ground. Fortunately they don't play much music in the movie.The real killer is that you've seen this movie before, in bits and pieces. Every imaginable cliche from every lame WW2 movie is included here, with very little variation. The result is very unsatisfactory.By the end of the movie you will feel you've wasted a perfectly good hour or so. You will wish you'd watched ""Ice Cold in Alex"" for the 100th time rather than this potboiler."
2,Great film POOR transfer to dvd,This is a great little war film with a super cast. However the VCI release is in pan and scan. What a let down especially as the film starts in full widescreen and then zooms in. I wouldnt care but they state on the box that they have restored it. Whats even better is they have a clip at the start of the film dedicating it to Guy Green the director. He will be turning in his grave at VCIs attempt at putting this film on dvd. When are dvd companies goign to realise that fans of films want them in their true glory. Not cropped. Great film let down by a poor dvd transfer
3,OKAY FEAR STREET BOOK,"INTO THE DARK WAS OKAY BUT NOT ONE OF THE BEST FEAR STREET BOOKS. THE ONLY THING I DID LIKE ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THAT R.L. STINE USED A BLIND CHARACTER AS A MAIN CHARACTER. BUT OTHER THEN THAT, IT WAS KIND OF PREDICTABLE."
5,Into The Dark - 5 Stars,"This is a great book. I loved how Paulette was so independant, and I liked Brad. The hold-up at Pete's Pizza was my favourite scene. Paulette sticks with her gut feeling and insists Brad is innocent...and is right. (I won't say who is really guilty!) Anyway, R. L. Stine held my utmost attention for the whole book. If I could, I would have given Into The Dark 100 stars!"
5,4 year old boy loves this book!,"My son loves hearing this story about Maxwell climbing the mountain over and over. This is a well written book that teaches children to be prepared before setting out on an adventure, a lesson that all parents want their children to learn. Buy a copy for your preschooler, especially if you love the outdoors."
1,Slowed the computer very substantially.,"Despite generally good experiences with Microsoft products, Windows Live OneCare seems to have resulted in very poor performance on a brand new Lenovo PC running Windows XP. I removed it and performance has improved back to where it was, now running McAfee for virus scanning etc."
1,Not recommended. Mediocre and buggy.,"There are much better anti-virus programs than this. Stay away. After scanning my computer, the program found a virus but the ""Quarantine Failed"". That can happen with certain files, BUT incredibly the program will not tell you which file is infected! This is a known issue mentioned on Microsoft website.Not only that, review sites state OneCare is not able to identify as many viruses as other programs. Finally, scanning your computer is much slower than competing programs if you have compressed files.On the positive side, program comes with backup/tuneup features and license for 3 computers. But software acts like BETA."
1,WARNING: DOES NOT SUPPORT 64 BIT,"I suppose I have myself to blame for not doing enough research, but I made the unpleasant discovery that OneCare will NOT work on Vista 64 (or xp64). This is totally absurd to me. The package calls it the ultimate companion for vista. It says NOTHING about 64 bit. To me, that is false advertising. It is stunning that Microsoft does not even support its own OS.Bottom line: If you run either Visa 64 or XP 64 DO NOT buy One Care. Norton 2007 works on Vista 64 and there is a free program called Avast that works as well. For some reason beyond understanding, Microsoft's own security program does not."
1,Gave up after 1 year,"Used one care for over a year. Problem is that it will consume all of your computers resources when you come out of standby. For example on a laptop that is in stanby and you want to check something quick, maybe a price on Amazon. When you open the lid on the laptop and the machine comes out of standby, one care essentially stops you from opening a browser or doing anything else for a few minutes. No way to stop this behavior, and no way to tell what one care is doing.Went to PC-cillin, it gives an option to stop what it is doing anytime, so you can avoid the delays caused by one care."
2,Mediocre,"Product is slow (mainly when doing a tune-up), and somewhat buggy. I'm waiting until my subscription expires to switch to their competitors."
5,Microsoft Windows Live OneCare 1.5 Online PC Care Subscription,This program is great. I had been using several Norton programs that seemed to cause problems with my Windows XP. This program doesn't slow down my Windows XP operating system and works smoothly. I've had no problems with error messages coming up and it provides security coverage and performance updates on a regular basis. I'm glad I switched!
4,Microsoft Windows Live one Care,"It is a good program but it was pain to install it, It required over 2 hours of Tech support to finally get it going."
1,Worst Microsoft Product ever,"I installed the product but it did not allow me to activate despite my having paid for the thing. The software apparently is not on the CD that they send you since a three hours download is required if using a modem or at least 1/2 hour with broadband. I am not sure why they even bothered with the CD since all you really get is a trial download. No phone number or any means of support or contacting Microsoft for help is provided anywhere in the product documentation. Since Microsoft does not support this product and will not let me activate a paid product, I guess I paid Amazon for a free 90 day trial. I have a dozen Microsoft products installed on my computers at home and at work but this is my first failure to activate experience. I do not recommend buying this product simply for the activation issues. I am not sure how it rates for virus protection, etc.. I did not get that far. I have nothing against Microsoft, but this product does not work for me."
4,PC Security,This program offers a complete set of tools for firewall and virus protection. It is not the most rigid or effective tool but does do a comprehensive protection package
5,Excellent product for non-savy computer users,"I had used Norton products for nearly 15 years. After having more and more problems with those, I finally got fed up with trying to fix what Norton messed up. After all, I don't use my computer to learn how to fix Norton's errors.I had also tried McAfee and Computer Associates stuff. Not really impressed.So I finally switched to Microsoft's Windows OneCare. It may not have all the bells and whistles of the other products, but at least I can now use my computer for doing the things I orginally obtained it for.I particularly like the auto-defragging feature. Why that was never put into the competitor's products is beyond me... it is a no-brainer.Now, if they will only put a password vault into it..."
4,backing up programs,"The product is great, but it keeps asking me to back up programs I have not even used yet, programs that came with the computer that I haven't deleted because I haven't taken the time to review, but want to get to eventually. I guess I can't wait. My choices are to have my security keep saying I am not safe or delete these previews so I can know for sure if I need to do an action or not."
3,Beautiful photos but...,"As wonderfully illustrated with beautiful photographs of Korean objects and authentic illustrations, I felt the explanations are equally lacking. The translator (not author) felt the need to inform readers that many Koreans disagree with the author's interpretations. It seems to me, as a Korean, that the prose style and content were inauthentic in tone; inaccurately representing the mindset of the Korean people. Koreans are a pragmatic people not prone to attach elaborate ceremony or philosophical meaning to every day objects, and as such are diametrically opposite to the Japanese. The book is full of philosophical musings and personal memories without (for me) historical or sociological proof, description or context."
2,"Terrible writing, terrific photographs","I was mesmerized by the pictures and bought it instantly.When I sat down to read it, however, I was dissapointed. The writing/translation is not fluent. Although the passages are short, I had a hard time getting through them. Furthermore, the comparisons (on almost every page) between Korea and the West were superficial and alienating.It was a pretty addition to my coffee table, though, so I didn't return it and can't give it a terrible score. The photos ARE very nice."
3,Tempting Fat,"I received the book Tempting Fate by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro about the Count St. Germain from the Russian Revolution through the rise of the Nazis in Germany. It is quite long and very detailed. It seems to drag in places, but it has kept me entertained for weeks so far and I'm only 2/3 through. I received it in battered, but readable condition."
4,Mounts in the middle of a 4x4 like it should!,"These are nice heavy duty plastic versions. We bought some similar ones from another tack vendor but being of Chinese orign, they apparently guess where to drill the holes. They were 1/4 inch too short to reach the centers and had cheap, flimsy pins that would bend at the first knock down. These cups are well made and sturdy.....and they fit!"
4,Not bad!,"I was weary when I decided to buy this tape -- after all, no one had reviewed it yet, and I wasn't familiar with the ""Core"" series of tapes. But I was pleasantly surprised! I liked the countdown timer, which let you know how many minutes were left in each of the 3 workouts. It was easy to see, but not intrusive. This is especially good for someone like me, who doesn't have a lot of time in the morning to exercise. I wanted a yoga tape that taught the sun salutation, and the first segment taught the different moves that make up the salutation. I liked this because not only did the instructor go step by step in describing and showing how each pose was, but one of the 2 background instructors showed how to do the moves in a modified form. This is great for yoga newcomers, who aren't very limber and unsure of what to do. All in all, a great buy!"
4,Good for beginners or a light workout,"I found a copy of this at a local thrift store and have been slacking on my yoga practice and thought a short pick-me-up would help. This tape is nice and, even though it is short, it has some really good postures included in it. Doing all three segments would be ideal and a nice little practice but even if you only do one of the 10-minute segments, it is better than nothing and you will feel results. The instructor is a bit on the annoying side but her instructions are clear and easy to follow. There is nothing overbearing or over-the-top to this tape; just clear-cut, to the point asanas. This would be great for beginners or people who are trying to get back into their practice like I am. I liked it and it was well worth the $1.99 I paid for it at the thrift store. :) Namaste."
5,Price of cd,You can buy Richard's cd from his website for $14.00 plus $3.00 for shipping. Why are people charging from $30-$50 for this cd when you can buy it at a regular price? Maybe they think people are too dumb to look elsewhere for it? That's insane. I hate to think someone would and probably has passed this cd up because of the price here - it's so good.
3,Nostalgic,"Wonky technology and good-old sf. Nostalgic at best. This book contains the Murray Leinster classic ""Sidewise in Time."" A pretty enjoyable read."
5,The New Knock...,"This Cat is at work .. He's putting out Flavourful Joints it seems Daily.. I think he has like 11 or 12 full Lp's out there..This new installment is just a collection of trax he's done in the last few yrs.. There are some real gems on this Ablum too.. and If your A MOKA Only Fan Im sure you've heard of some of them.. My Faves on this one are .. ""Take IT In"".. ""Sunday's""...""Love Cant Wait""...the Jazzy ""Pure Sex""..and the Last track ""Instrumental Outro"".. If you like a laid back style/approach and fresh ryhmes from the Fresh Coast.. Cop this one.. Grade Abonis..."
3,mmm i am so dumb,"You know if i would rate this on the first (second or third) feeling..i will rate 1 star..but in the meantime i don't really understand that kind of thing..so 3 is a neutral vote.It's a mix of rnb/G-rap/pop/hip-hop beats which is going nowhere..and the vocals are samely diverse and all that accorded to the beats when it can match.Maybe its a treasureland..maybe a garbage, surely experimental.Sorry, i don't like at all."
2,Huh?,"To me, this book does not take a good approach to teaching slide. Im a guitar player wanting to play slide and I grabbed this book/cd off the rack. It doesnt really seem like this book is trying to start you from the ground up by teaching easy techniques then putting them together. It just kind of gives you some tab for an exercise, a track on the CD, the teacher talks while playing some neat sounding stuff, but never tells you HOW to do it. Sure, the tab is there, but give me some more guidance dude. Not much technique is ever given aside from the absolute basics. From there the book jumps to harder licks without giving enough guidance.Two Thumbs Down on this one."
5,KristyPChicago,Lewis Black is insanely funny in this new DVD!! This is worth the pre-order or immediate buy when it comes out. You have got to pick this up! If you don't you'll be missing out on some life changing comedy.
2,What Happened to Lewis Black,"What happened to Lewis Black? He used to be funny. Not one of his better routines. The material just wasn't very good, and you could tell he just wasn't that confident in his stuff. Disappointing."
1,I want my money Black,This dvd does not deserve a half star but that wasn't a rateing option.I to Love the comedy of Lewis Black but the problem was... There wasn't any !I find It very sad when a comic has run out of material but creates a video or cdanyway. What's the matter Lewis? Are you broke or did you just want to trashyour reputation. Might I suggest instead of buying this piece of crap that you simply flush the money down the toilet. If thats stand up then Lewis needs to sit down
1,THIS SUCKS,I'm not kidding. This isn't remotely close to being funny. It's horrible. Do not buy it. Do not rent it. THIS SUCKS.
1,Terrible,Worst piece of garbage that Lewis ever did!! Not funny at all like his earlier stuff!! Time for him to give it up!!
2,"Low Energy, Mostly Not Funny",I was hugely disappointed in this DVD. I am a big fan of Lewis Black but I turned this off less than halfway through. I eventually watched it all but it only confirmed my opinion about what I had already seen. He is positively calm in contrast to his last high-energy DVD at the theater in DC. I could not recommend this to anyone. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it.
3,WARNING: may prompt prudes into cardiac arrest,"There are several topics that Lewis takes on with avengence and are genuinely hilarious, but overall it doesn't live up to Lewis Black's other works."
1,I hated it,He used curse words to compensate for boring material; the audience seemed bored too. Usually he's pretty fun but not here
5,"Incredible, Insightful indeed.",This film is a great way to understand some of what was going on the first decade of the 21st century.
5,Awesome,"I love Lewis black! He is super funny, and I now own 4 of his DVDs... This one is just as good as broadway if not better!"
2,Disappointed,Good looking radio but disappointing performance. Owner's manual is very confusing and contains several mistakes/wrong advice. AM reception is horrible and the electronic tuning is not accurate. It does not tune in stations on the correct frequency. Solar charger does not seem to work and I still don't understand how the AA bateries kick in.
2,Emergency radio,"This product has been disappointing----at least in our area. The image rejection is so weak that we can only pick up one strong station----and that is all over the dial. The price was right and the multi-power source was what we wanted, but it isn't very usable for us."
2,Not very good,I have bought Kaito in the past and have been plz'd.. This was to replace ours that had finally died after steady use for many yrs... This one lasted 2 months.
4,"Well, not quite...","The problem with this (welcome) new disc by guitar phenom Albert Lee is that too many songs hover around a medium tempo, and though fine tunes in their own right, do not lend themselves well to showing off Lee's extraordinary chops. It may be true here that Lee's biggest hurdle is older Albert Lee recordings, as this one just isn't COUNTRY BOY-era awesome. Luxury Liner certainly helps reaffirm his status, but often the best musicians are not always the best leaders. The CD is pleasant enough, but needs more spice."
5,No Heartbreak,This is a great album. From the start of the first track to the final sounds it is captivating and lively music. Albert is an artist who deserves greater recognition than he already has. Excellent.
3,Been there,"The two year journal of a teacher & meterioroligist who answered an ad to go to Antarctica. The tale of his experiences and observations. At that time the British presence in the Antarctica region was called the Falklands Islands Dependencies Survey. This changed once the Antarctic treaty was sicned in 1961 (while Pearce was in Antarctica). Passingly interesting and funny in places, dry and tedious in others. Would never have finished the book if I hadn't been there and interested in the area. Intersperses his experiences and tales with a review of the history of scientific expeditions in the past.Obviously from a different era. They dumped their sewage directly into the water, threw garbage out the door to be delt with by the wind, and killed seals to feed the sled dogs. None of these happen anymore.The worth of this book is that he experienced the end of an era."
1,seriously...,Why would anyone ever buy this? Why would anyone produce and relase a CD randy savage? There's so many things I dont understand. This is the worst crap ever. Seriously
1,OH YEAH! DIG IT!,"YO MAN, THIS IS THA BEST ALBUM I EVER HEARD IF YOU WANNA BE JUST LIKE DA MACHO MAN AND HIT PEOPLE WIT CHAIRS DIS IS DE ALBUM TA BUY ITS SO RAD ITS EVEN BETTER THAN DAT RED-FLAVORED TOOTHPASTE WIT THA GUY THAT SAYS ""BAM!"" ON THA COMMERCIAL. GET THIS FOOL OR I'LL BODYSLAM YO CANDY ASS!OH YEAH!!!!!DIG IT!!!!!"
1,this sucks,"Macho man and hip hop should never again be mentioned in the same sentence. this is horrible, as a mc myself this is a total joke and should not be taken seriously. Its funny and nothing more, but its funny to me how everybody is trying to rap and can't. What is this world comin too, Macho man and rap just doesn't go together. Then to top it all off I read someones review that said he was the best since pac, this is a joke that should never be mentioned again. I'm not haten but as an mc i'm only keepin it real so quit it with the games."
1,"Don't listen to the others - this is terrible, awful!","When I saw this CD being compared with RUN DMC and people saying MACHO MAN actually had MIC SKILL, I had to put something down. DO NOT BUY THIS CD AT ALL COSTS. It contains a bunch of sub-par beats, if that, a 54 year old man who rasps while he raps, and a bunch of lame one liners and weak insults. Okay? If you want to hear rap with good beats buy something else! Like Nelly, Murphy Lee, Ras Kass, Dr. Dre, XZibit, Outkast/Big Boi.... actually, I'd rather hear someone tap on a window and beat box over it than listen to him rap about his 3 minute cameo on Spider Man as a feature role. It was called ""Spider Man"" not ""White Men Can't Rap"". Eminem would be tearin up the Mach' if he heard this. This is a discrace to MUSIC!"
1,Saved by the Bell - Sort of says it all doesnt it!?,"If you notice....in the section marked, ""people who bought this CD also bought.."", it lists ""Saved by the Bell, The Soundtrack"". If that doesn's say it all!"
4,Break the chains,"As soon as you get one look at the cover, you'll know that macho man is serious about rocking you hard. What you won't know is that he plans on stripping down and revealing some of his frustrations to a greedy public. Sure, there are classic-rock republican anthems like ""RU Ready,"" ""Feel the Madness,"" and ""I'm Back,"" but there are also a number of camp-inspired tunes like ""Tear it up,"" ""Be a Man,"" and ""Macho Thing"" that reveal that Macho Man may have a thing for other Macho Men. Still, it's the touching ballads ""Perfect Friend"" and ""Hit the Floor"" that make the album work as a new brand of emo. If you are into Dashboard Confessional, this should be your scene."
5,this is for my perfect friend the macho man,"i've never seen a mc drop such hot lyrics...he brings the crowd ro their feet while they listen 2 it in their rooms...I'M BACK...those words brought me to tears with excitement..ive never been so into a cd...i listen 2 it every night...what a sick flow...2pac,biggie,rakim,gza,rza or the whole wu-tang clan,have nothing on him...they look like phonies compared to the macho man...and all of his swear words like derriere made me wanna get to the club and hit it...but only hit it to this cd...cuz it's so hot on the charts...i only have one thing to say to u fans...be a man...or ill kick u in the butt and wash ur mouth out with soap...and by the way...he has the sexiest body in the history of rap...sexier then 50 cent...and eminem...and fat joe or ja rule...i just wanna be like macho man when i grow up...he's my idol"
3,Hulk Hogan is a Real Big Punk,"When my mom purchased this CD for my 23rd birthday, I opened the package and thought I had died and gone to heaven. Little did I know that the hype surrounding this album would pale in comparision to its astounding lyrical quality and phenomenal beats. The Macho Man brings the pain like no other wrestling rapper can. I would like to personally thank Randy Savage for allowing his loyal fans a look into his world of madness, even if its viewed through those mammoth visor-like glasses he used to wear to the ring. Macho proved you don't have to swear to get your point across!"
2,Was this a joke?,"The only reason I've rated this album 2 stars instead of a 1 is because the production was very well put together. Lyrically, it is garbage. I give him an A for effort, but as far as rapping skills go, he gets a F."
1,BRUTAL,"Oh man you hardcore wrestling fans are a riot!!!!""When my mom purchased this CD for my 23rd birthday, I opened the package and thought I had died and gone to heaven.""WOW!!!!This cd is brutal. Actually, not brutal, cuz it has huge comedic elements. I love this cd. I've never laughed so hard in my entire life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Keep it up Mach~~~~~~~~~"
1,Boggles my mind,"Are you people sniffing leminent? The greatest cd ever, it changed my life, Macho man is god himself.I fell out of my chair laughing. I'd rather sit in a pile of dog crap than listen to this."
1,sux but proves a point,first i enjoyed watchin him in wrestlin but after he retired..i mean seriously JUST STOP! the point he proves is that ne one in the world can rap. see even macho man. rap isnt really music its just talkin fast. but im not gonna get into it. but this cd is a joke. i dont see the point of him doing this. he was in commercials and tv he has enought money..WHY!? WHY!? this is just pathetic. all u poeple sayin its good..lol.. are kiddin yourselves.
1,Is Savage Losing His Mind?,"I don't know who I'm more embarrassed for, his fans who bought this CD, or the Macho Man himself. I can't believe this is the same person who put on that Wrestlemania 3 classic way back when. Randy Savage is losing his touch with reality fast. From his downright lousy attempt to call out Hulk Hogan to his pathetic meaningless rhymes, I think it's safe to say that no 50 year old washed up wrestler is allowed within the vicinities of the world of rap. I read an article which said that Savage has recently started to enjoy the music of Eminem and Run DMC. This album proves that absolutely anyone can make a rap CD to satisfy his ego as long as he has enough name credibility."
1,Ummm is this a wrestling gimmick?,"Seriously I think this is the WWF's attempt to ""punk"" the fans of the wrestling world. Its gotta be, this cant be serious! This album sucks, I could just picture Hogan, Savage, and McMahon having a good laugh at wrestlemania going ""people who bought this cd and believed this feud was real....well you've been punk'd!"" I mean how serious are we suspose to take Macho as a rapper? Whats he going to do to Hogan, a drive by closeline?! If I were Hulk Hogan I wouldnt even bother answering this crap. I would just let the critics rip this cd to shreds and have a good laugh! I love the part where he talks about his ""feature"" role in spiderman...I agree with that one guy who said it was a cameo role lol, besides in the movie he gets his ass kicked by Toby McGuire so thats not really something you should be singing about in a rap song about wanting someone to be a man. Avoid CD AT ALL COST! Makes a great christmas gag gift though!"
1,These good reviews have to be jokes DO NOT BE FOOLED,I did not buy this album. In fact I would not even accept a free copy of it. The songs I heard on the net were so bad my ears felt like they were bleeding. It was worse than I could have possibly imagined. It is so bad that it is funny when you first hear it. But that fun turns pain after the second time.DO NOT WASTE 14 BUCKS ON THIS THING. GREG BRADY AND RODNEY DANGERFIELD WERE BETTER RAPPERS. Go to Machoman's site first. You will thank me when you hear how truly putrid it is.By the way I would have given it negative stars if I could have.
1,Ridiculous,"Any positive review of this piece of garbage had to be written by Savage or one of his Slim-Jim snappin' disciples. This is a total joke. What the hell is up with people saying that THIS changed their lives? I had to put on a pair of pampers after reading the first few reviews. It was hilarious. Anyways, this is a totally disgraceful attempt to be filed under the genre of hip hop. If you wanna hear a guy with candy paint colored skin and a ridiculous voice rap, buy this cd. In fact, buy eight like that other idiot suggested. There's only one thing worse than being a joke and that's a bad joke. Ridiculous! I have a good mind to go to the Big Boss Man about this."
1,Amazing,"Wow, this came out recently? Hilarious. I can just imagine this guy at the Source awards dissin' the Hulkster. Well, I'd say the album cover sums up this lil mistake. However, if you like wrestling.... kill yourself now and do the human race a big favor. YOU'RE SLOWING DOWN OUR EVOLUTION!"
5,10000000 stars,"Id give it 10000000 stars if I could. This is the BEST RAP album that I've ever heard!!!! The one tiny critism that I have is that, as usual, the Macho Man is too understated.OHHHHHHHHHH YEA!!!!!"
1,dear...lord.,"what the hell is happening here? Macho Man has a rap CD? Perhaps shortly we will see pigs flying and hell suffer through a cold spell. This is a disgrace not only to rap music, not only to music in general but to every kid who lays down his allowance for this album. Macho Man rapping...somebody slap me. Hulk Hogan may be a real big punk...but Randy's career be in da dump.there you go, I can rap too.sign me now.im going to clean my ears."
1,Please... No...,"When I first heard bout this, like many others, I thought what the..Peeped a few tracks... and damn..I thought 50 had taken hip hop as low as it could get but no.. this.. is.. wack.If you are a real hip hop fan.. do not buy this, don't waste time d/l it either.Man.. its terrible..The whole thing about the guy even having the audacity to release it is messed up..He should be shot....9 times.. just make sure the job gets done this time.. Jeez..."
1,What Does This Prove?,"That the genre of hip-hop is so shallow and predictable that evem this numbskull can figure out it's formula. As soon as MTV stops playing it, there will be a new mainstream. Keep hope alive, my friends."
2,Macho man needs help.,Macho man needs help. Oh yeah. His voice bad.Enough said. I give it 2 out of 5
1,Why?,"I thought this was a joke, but sadly its true. This cd is crap.Macho Man is an awesome wrestler. He's one of my favorites. If he's gonna do music at least do rock not crap; oh I mean rap.Rap in general is pure garbage."
5,Macho Man makes a statement with Be A Man,"After years of hard work and dedication in the wrestling business, Macho Man Randy Savage proves that today's modern man is a multi-tasker. Be A Man combines soothing lyrics to hip beats and creates an aural experience never heard before. He shows his versatility in songs such as Be A Man, where he aggressively ""disses"" rival Hulk Hogan, and songs like A Perfect Friend, where his tender side is revealed in a ballad-like eulogy to his fallen ally in the squared circle, Kurt Hennig. I give the album three thumbs up and hope that you all can enjoy it as much as I did."
1,words cannot explain,"at first i heard macho man randy savage made an album from my friend. we had a good laugh about how funny it would be and i decide to look for his site to see if it was true and to listen to a few of his songs. so i listen to them, and to tell you the truth, i was absolutely disgusted at this horrendous attempt at an album. This is an abhorration. I want to knock some sense, or at least some teeth, into Macho Man after this one. I dont watch wrestling, but I know Randy Savage anyway. And I of course know who Hulk Hogan is. Randy Savage's thinly veiled ""attack"" on Hulk Hogan is quite simply the biggest joke I have ever heard. It's also the funniest things I have ever heard, and my jaw dropped when I heard it. Is Randy Savage out of his mind? Does he really think that Hulk Hogan will accept his ""challenge""? They are professional wrestlers. Your feud is pure fabrication. IT IS NOT REAL! This is a joke. Don't even consider buying it. DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER BUYING IT."
1,ohhhhhhh NO!,"This is proof that a little bad advice can go a long way. It was apparently a chance meeting between savage and Big3 records chairman Bill Edwards that produced this joke of a CD. Mr Edwards should have been dragged out in the street and shot. Savage actually tried to promote this thing down in florida, and was heckled to the point of throwing down the microphone. Even funnier is the fact that his road agent is Bryan Adams( Demolition Crush ) of Kronik. I will say this, if you must buy this thing, buy two..one to burn and the other to keep the fire going."
1,PATHETIC,"I feel bad for the poor souls who not only purchased this cd, but the ones whos ears even came in contact with this horrible garbage. If i had a dime for everytime i contemplated murdering macho man and every person involved in the creation of this album, i'd be a rich person right about now. Macho man, i will pray to god, allah, buddah, jesus and maybe even satan that you are shot to death in a drive by...possibly by a old man riding a lawn mower just for comedic value.The fact that you're forced to give this album no less than 1 star on here already qualifies it as being overrated."
5,Greatest rap album ever,"Its macho man, what do you expect? The rhymes are terrible and so are the beats but its comical to listen to."
5,This album has changed my life!!!!,"Macho man has enlivened the palette that was my sad, horrible life and renewed me to a wonderful plane of existence! When he raps so eloquently ""People want to know if Macho's still in the ring"", I'm thinking to myself, yes! People want to know if we're ALL still ""in the ring!"" It's an amazing prospect. Get in the ring and buy this wonderful album now! Macho Man will be touring, and I hear Bono of U2 is really into his message and might appear on stage with him. Another artist appearing with Macho Man will be Yo-Yo Ma. This is a triple threat of pure musical genius! Oh yeah, Snap into a Slim Jim!"
5,Real Ultimate Talent!!!1,"Holy crap! this album is totally sweet! ""Macho"" Man Randy savage tells it like it is, and doesn't even care! 3 facts about Macho MAn Randy Savage everyone should know:1. Macho Man Randy Savage is a mammal.2. Macho Man Randy Savage fights ALL the time.3. The purpose of Macho Man Randy Savage is to flip out and kill people.Macho Man Randy Savage is sooooooooooo sweet that I want to crap my pants. I can't believe it sometimes, but I feel it inside my heart. He is totally awesome and that's a fact. Macho Man Randy Savage is fast, smooth, cool, strong, powerful, and sweet. I can't wait to start rapping next year. I love Macho Man Randy Savage with all of my body (including my pee pee)."
2,Unreal......,Unreal... Just because he's too old to wrestle doesn't mean he should rap. I gave him two stars because at least somebody's buying it and because I'm somewhat biased.
1,No. Please No. You people are retarded.,This CD is the worst hip hop album ever.It ain't even hip hop.. it's plain wack.WTF are you thinking giving this 5 stars?!'A life changing album'ROFLMFAO!!retarded.Get a damn life. This cd is the worst thing to happen to hip hop in the history of the world.nooooooooooooooooooooooo! Don't buy this trash.
1,you have got to be kidding me,"i come from a house hold biult from true Emcees like krs-one a tribe called quest ganstarr and main source. Not the garbage emcees who have pounded the music we call hip-hop 6 feet underground, well what do you expect if guys luke nelly and puff daddy are allowed to rap well than this fagget should be able to pick up a mike too. if you really want to indulge youself into this vulgar blend of absolutely terrible prodction lyrics and just plain lack of talent than pick up this c.d., you can probably find it at a local K-mart of other convienent stores that have no buisiness selling musicR.I.P. hip-hop 1980-1998ohh yeah and by the way i tried to rate this album with zero stars but i had to give it one jsut to post the review"
2,A good cd,It is actually a good cd but the only disturbing thing about the Gladiators is that there is no much variety on their tracks.Their style of play does not change much.This group should take lessons from Misty In Roots.I will give this cd to a lucky newcomer in reggae.
4,When I first heard that I would be ...,"When I first heard that I would be Test Driving a gel solid I was a bit worried as I had tried a gel deodorant once and didn't like it at all. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the emphasis should have been on the solid. There was none of the stickiness I expected with a gel. I find this product to be very effective and I'd recommend it to others."
3,This deodorant worked very well. Unfortunately it's not ...,"This deodorant worked very well. Unfortunately it's not sheer on all skin complexions. I wouldn't be able to use it with sleeveless tops at all. I'd recommend it to family and friends for its protection, not for its sheerness."
4,"Overall, I was very pleased with Secret Sheer ...","Overall, I was very pleased with Secret Sheer Dry Gel Solid. It goes on smoothly and isn't sticky or wet as some others that I've tried. On my next purchase of this product, I'd go with the scented instead of the unscented, though. The unscented kept me dry, however I experienced a small amount of odor on a very hot day. I think using the scented will take care of this problem."
5,I liked a few things about this product. ...,"I liked a few things about this product. First, there was no scent, which means no clashing with perfumes. Second, it kept me dry! I tend to sweat (unfortunately) and even while exercising, I was fine -- much to my surprise!! I've tried other products that claim to work, but this one has really proven itself to me. I have recommended it to my sister, since we're alike. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to stay dry and keep from ruining good blouses, which I've done too many times to count."
1,It should be good,I havn't read this book. I would like to buy one but only after viewing briefly the contents of the book. Once I have bought one copy only then I will be in a position to review.Though I hv filled some stars because it is mandatory.Thank you.
4,"Yes, lovely, but no Guinn/deGaetani","Yes, this is a lovely album and the additional songs previously unrecorded in the digital age are appreciated. The performers are as would be expected, have heard Molly, Jay and Hampson for years and they certainly are familiar with this genre. They could've performed with their shoes off a bit more..The struggle is that nothing, absolutely nothing beats the 1977 Nonesuch Leslie Guinn and the late Jan de Gaetani double recordings of this music. They are heartbreakingly beautiful and so evoke the time like few others. The singers are ""art"" singers, no doubt, but as an earlier posting observed, Foster is the American Schubert. Nonesuch slapped together a single CD of these recordings- an ill-advised and boorish effort on their part, but the fragments that remain are transcendent. Long may the red rose live always............"
2,DISAPPOINTING PROGRAMMING,"I was surprised that Thomas Hampson chose to sing so few of Stephen Foster's most famous songs on this recording. Of those he sings, some are performed in a character that I do not believe is in keeping with the period. While the chosen instrumentation is one possible interpretation of the sound of the period, it lacks variety and fails to convey the importance of the rather formal parlor song as Foster's forte."
1,DISMAYED FOLK MUSIC FAN,"I love Stephen Foster. I grew up singing his greatest songs: Oh! Susanna, Camptown Races, Old Folks At Home. Much to my dismay, Mr. Hampson does not sing Foster's most famous songs on this CD! The instrumental renditions are fine, but I miss the immortal Foster lyrics."
4,We love trucks,"This puzzel was smaller than expected, but the challenge for a 2 1/2 yr old is very good. The pieces are durable and he is always proud of himself when he completes all of them."
1,worst of the Ilsa's - she tortures men!?,"Technically probably the soundest, but the least entertainingof the Ilsa movies. She tortures men - can you say ""unclearon the concept, are we?"" See ""Greta Infinite Power"" aka""Ilsa the wicked warden"" dir. by Franco."
2,Not the originals,"This CD gets a big thumbs down in my book. While many of the tunes are valiant attempts at recreating the original themes we all love, this CD does not contain the original themes and this is evident throughout the CD. The ""Seinfeld"" theme particularly is a poor cut. Shop around and find the original themes instead of buying this CD."
5,thorughbred champions,i thought it was a wonderful book with so much info about horses i love. everything was in this book . i would buy again from amazon.
3,"Informative and fun, but...","This book was great to read, and while I am a big horse racing fan, I don't think you need to be to enjoy it. However, while Man O' War was indeed a great horse...definitely deserving to be in the top five, he was not Secretariat, who, in my opinion, was far and away the choice to be number one. Secretariat set a track record in the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont, and but for a malfunctioning clock, would have done the same in the Preakness. Man O' War, by comparison, didn't even run in the Kentucky Derby. Save for this glaringly poor choice of the number one horse, I'd recommend this book for any enthusiast."
1,1 star because the bloodhorse...,"...editors are idiots. *secret* when the editors voted secretariat was firmly in first place with only one editor left to vote, and he LEFT OFF secretariat as one of the top thoroughbreds of the 20th century so man o'war could take first prize. what a putz! man o'war was great, but charlie hatton, longtime editor of the daily racing form who saw BOTH horses run in person always said that secretariat was the finest racehorse ever ('the pinnacle of achievement in thoroughbred racing, the finest example of the blooded horse'). can't argue with secretariat's 22 pound heart, largest on record."
1,What?,"If there ever was a horse better than Secretariat, he would have had to spread his wings and fly!! How could anyone think-now I don't care what Man 'O War did-that there could be anyone even CLOSE to Secretariat? The author does not know what he's talking about."
5,Outstanding Reference Book for Racing Fans,"While this book will provoke arguments among racing fans as to which horses merit the ""greatest"" label, this is indispensible to anyone who loves thoroughbred racing. While most of the horses were and are familiar names to racing fans, some are not so well-known. Each horse is described in brief yet highly detailed biographies, and there are photographs galore.As I said, there will be arguments as to which horses were the best, and the authors note how low the fillies, especially Ruffian, arguably a top 10 horse, ended up on the list. There was also some controversy over Secretariat's ranking, as one of the seven experts did not even list him in the top 10, thus he managed to finish only number two on the list, behind Man O' War (this immediately calls into question the ""expertise"" of the unidentified panelist).But that's what these lists are for, to provoke discussion and even argument. I found this book endlessly fascinating."
4,Did he see it?,"Charlie Hatton, editor of the Daily Racing Form was born in 1906. Died 1975 at 69.He was 13, 14 when (or if) he saw Man o' war in 1919-20! U think he could compare Man o' war and Secretariat 52 yrs later?"
3,"Good, but...","You guys really need to get your act together. This book is solid opinion, and I understand that, but you really need to use your brains. A better winning record doesn't make a better horse. Secretariat should not be #2, he should be first. Man o'War had a better record, true, but did he have a 22 pound heart and did he set a world record? No!!! Also, Secretariat shattered lots of Man o' War's records. And Ruffian should definitely be higher up on the scale. Other than that, it's pretty good"
4,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd: A Review,"Christie's ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" leaves you both breathless and puzzled. There is little action to recommend in the middle, so it can be a boring read at certain points. You want so badly to know WHO. As with all of Christie's mysteries, everyone is a suspect, and if you don't pay acute attention, you'll miss the clues. The ending was a shocker for me. I highly recommend this book, despite it's tedious middle."
5,A great book!,"This was one of the best Agatha Christie books I've read so far. The beginning was good and as soon as the murder was committed, I really wanted to know who did it. I read most of the book in one day because I really wanted to get to the ending. If you read this book, once you find out who the murderer was, you will be completely shocked! This book had a great solution and you should definitely read it."
4,"Murder, betrayal, blackmail & secrets!","Reading this book felt like playing the board game Clue on the pages -- was it Mr. White in the dining room with the dagger?When Dr. Sheppard's friend Roger Ackroyd is murdered, everyone is a suspect. Hercule Poirot comes on the scene and the reader is drawn along, seeing only what Dr. Sheppard sees and never fully understanding what the miraculous Poirot is about to uncover. Dr. Sheppard's sister, the village gossip is a welcome, light-hearted addition to the story. Blackmail, drug use, neighborhood snoops, mysterious phone calls and betrayal all play a part in this wonderful mystery."
2,.....the story just wasn't entertaining,"Being a fan of past mystery book I have read, especially ""And Then There Were None"" by Agatha Christie I had no trouble picking up ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" The plot became a monotonous listing of facts and clues through dialog. It would've been almost impossible to predict the mystery through nearly the entire story with the given information. The end finally picked up and kept me interested, but the rest of the story just wasn't entertaining."
2,NOT A GOOD READ,"Book reviews and movie reviews are much the same. Two people can read the same book and have totally opposite opinions.If one person loved it and the other hated it, is the book good or bad? Neither. Having said that, I found this not to be one of Agatha's best. No exotic locale, just a stodgy English village. The book itself seemed stodgy and pedantic, not a page-turner, by any means. And the ending......what a disappointment! Frustrating. No fair......."
3,Many a motive,"This Agatha Christie novel is written from the family doctor perspective, who is called late one evening to examine the death of his friend, Roger Ackroyd. Christie keeps the reader guessing until the very end of the book, with many characters possessing the motive for murder. The plot is also made more difficult by narrowing the time of the murder down to 10 or 15 minutes. Various characters lack alibis for this quarter of an hour, and the famous Hercule Poirot must ferret the truth out with a grand finale gathering of all the suspects (similar to a Thin Man movie). The reader will be surprised by the ending, as the murderer in Christie novels is not usually viewed from this perspective."
5,A mystery that is never solved by the reader,"Agatha Christie is noted for great mysteries. This is probably her best. It is a mystery that the reader will never solve without the help of Ms. Christie--even though all the clues are given. It is fun to read the book and then check back to the portions that made the murder so unsolvable. If you haven't read it, do so; if you have read it, do it again."
5,The best book I've ever read!,"This book, like any Agatha Christie novel, was fantastic! This is one of her books though that the ending of it will never have occured to you even once. I know a lot of her books are like that, but with most you can at least guess close to the mark maybe. This one, though, is just so surprising that, like i said before, the thought of it would have never once occured to you. It caught me completely off guard, I would have never guessed! So if you like a good mystery novel with one of those magnificent surprise endings, this book is completely for you. I recommend it 100%. It was the best Agatha Christie I have read so far, and I have read quite a lot. I'd say it's better than ""And Then There Were None"" and ""Murder on the Orient Express"", and those were my favorites. What I'm trying to say, once again, through all this rambling, is that this truely is an amazing book. I recommend it to all Christie, and mystery, lovers 100%."
3,A good read,"Enjoyed this book. Agatha is a whizz at creating mysterious characters and making a vital clue just slip into the background, making it inconsequential to the reader. Everyone has to read at least one Agatha Christie book in their lifetime - and this one might as well be it."
4,Poirot at his best!!,If you are a fan of Agatha Christie - and especially her Hercule Poirot mysteries - then you owe yourself this treat.It is the most astounding ending of any of his cases. No more info !!!!I want you to find out for yourself!
3,Shocked there was no shock ending!!!!,"I had high hopes for this book. I really expected to be knocked off my feet with the surprise ending everyone talked about. It seems I am the only one who WAS NOT shocked at the end. I think the ""reveal"" would have been much more effective if Christie would have told us the murderer's name first and then let Poirot give the evidence. It's not hard at all to figure out who the culprit is as Poirot says ""the murderer has to be someone who is this, had this, and was here when....."". By the time Poirot finally revealed the name, I had no doubt who was guilty. I was totally let down. I wish I hadn't figured it out. This is in no way a bad book. It is as good as everyone says. Yet, so much rides on the ""reveal"" so if you don't figure it out, it will make all the difference in the world in your opinion of the book."
3,A good story; disapointing ending,"This book has a great story line, but the ending is too predictable for me. It was a great disapointment from all the hype."
3,Baffling story but unlikable characters and unacceptable philosophy,"When a wealthy man is found stabbed to death, the suspects include his adopted son, his greedy sister-in-law, various houseguests and servants, and a mysterious blackmailer. Bereft of his usual aide Hastings, Poirot makes use of the narrator, the town physician.I knew whodunit before I started the book, so it was more a case of ""but he couldn't have done it"" than ""who could have done it?"" And Christie successfully baffled me through most of the book. Not many of the characters were particularly likable, and it was curiosity about a book that set so many of her readers howling that kept me reading, more than the plot itself. I particularly objected to Christie's use of suicide as a ""solution"" to major life problems. Spelling, grammar, and formatting were fine, and the title was certainly relevant to the story."
3,Good solid Christie,"This struck me as almost a Christie pastiche; the number of (perfectly-timed) secret liaisons in the gazebo, secret engagements, secret marriages, poisoners, blackmailers, murders, suicide, unacknowledged children, torn scraps of cloth and so on per captia seems high even for Dame Agatha. Still, a fun read.Maybe because I'd heard about how shocking and controversial the ending is, I twigged who the murderer was by about chapter four. Still, it was fun to watch the buildup and conclusion, and we get a fresh (although quite Hastings-like) view of Poirot. Three stars, but then I'm a hard grader! *8)"
5,"If you read Detective Fiction at all, you must read this","This book is unusual for a number of reasons. It raised a huge debate when it came out. Dorthy Sayers, who in addition to writing fine books herself was a published critic of literature and played an important role in setting out the rules of a murder mystery, came strongly to its defence. Her comments are well worth searching out and reading for yourself.Unlike most novels of its type, it bear rereading.Because I was at one time a professor of English literature and chose to offer a survey course in Detective Fiction, I have read this book many times and enjoyed identifying the many clever clues provided by the author.Christie plays fair with the reader and presents a tale which stands out among the thousands which have been written. I encourage you to experience this unusual and satifying book."
4,Suspect everyone!,"I am so glad our bookclub chose this- its my first christie and it won't be my last. It was amazing the subtle way the clues were introduced and how Poirot gets at the truth. I didn't mind all the liasons, for the end was so good, that made all the twists and turns worth it."
4,No one escapes suspicion!,What a great book I picked for my first Agatha. I can't believe how well she twisted the hints in with the story- so that the ending was both shocking and logical. Glad I started my mystery reading with a book so well written.
4,The most mind-enthralling of mysteries.,"This is probably the best of the mysteries that I have read. The twisting plot, the clues that leave you with a thousand theories. It starts off with the typical mystery of a bribe, death of the person who was bribed, death of the person who was supposedly to know everything about the bribe, and to top it off, a missing relative of the deceased. It might seem simple, but the time-to-time discoveries and conclusions of our little Belgian detective left my mind aghast and confused for hours. Even though Agatha Christie has used such perfect words and descriptions, the little clues won't seem obvious untill the end, which is something like a big blow to the head. It left me saying to myself, ""How could I have missed something so clear!"""
5,One of her Best!!!!!!!,"I am an avid Agatha Christie fan and this novel was exceptional! This surpasses Murder on the Orient Express and Ten Little Indians BIGTIME! If you love Agatha Christie's novels, then you MUst read this. The ending is so masterfully written. This book really showcases Christie's genius for character."
4,Excellent!,"This book was interesting, and the end actually surprised me which doesn't happen a lot! Also nice to read a book where there isn't a lot of cussing/smut. Would definitely recommend this to friends and even teens."
2,shocking but not believable,"Yes, the ending was quite shocking... but not believable. There was no real motive provided..., it felt like a trick on the reader. I have found Christie's novels too far-fetched for me. I will stop reading her and stick to Dorothy Sayers, who paints wonderful pictures of the pop culture of 1920-1930's England."
2,not good!,"don't trust the 'in 1926, christie wrote her masterpiece : the murder of roger ackroyd.' i got to admit it has a nice begining. but, the middle was half Boring. the ending was disappointing! the worst part was the identity of the murderer."
4,Works well,"After I got the timing and the amount of water correct for my microwave, this worked well. It did boil over, though, when I put in three scoops of rice."
3,Prone to boiling over,"I had to use trial and error at first to find a microwave power level that would cook the rice as fast as possible without making the water boil over and make a mess in the microwave. On the two microwaves I've used, this power level is between 3 and 5, depending on the power of the microwave.It also works for pasta, although a box of pasta *barely* fits, so it's much better suited to a half-box at a time at the most."
1,MELTED!,"The rice cooker (followed included instructed exactly) melted after 11 minutes, and some rice calls for 30 minutes.THIS PRODUCT IS DANGEROUS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
3,Just the Basics But Good Results,"This my second microwave rice cooker. They are very quick and easy to use. I never cook rice in any other way now. I had my old one for over 10 years. This Progressive model is smaller and has one less lid component then my old one. The second time I used this new one I tried 2 cups of dried rice. I microwaved it for 22 minutes. The rice was still cooked just fine. Some of it boiled over, causing a bit of a clean up. Maybe I will try 20 minutes next time. Cooking 1 cup is no problem. I think 2 cups is the max on this model. I will continue to use it. My star rating is a 3, which means good, with 4 being very good and 5 being excellent. Lost points for size and skimping on the lid setup."
4,"Makes rice okay, but oatmeal better","I bought this to save space. Of course, it doesn't turn out rice like my electric rice cooker did, but it's okay. But what I discovered is that it makes great oatmeal. I just follow the directions on the oatmeal box."
4,as advertised,"When all you want is well cooked rice (without all the bells, whistles, and space needed that an electric one has)look no further. Makes 3 cups of rice in 18 minutes, and the rice is perfect. It's not to wet or undercooked. Clean is easy. Just stick it in the d/w."
4,Microwaveable Rice Cooker Set,Easy to use and works well. Lighter to lift from microwave helps me as I have MS.
5,Handy Dandy little cooker/container!,"I got this little cooker to replace a Revere Cleverware container that I used to cook rice in the microwave until recently. (One can't get the Cleverware anymore.) I was skeptical that it would work but I read the reviews of it on Amazon.com and got it anyway. This little cooker surprised me and worked like a charm! I am so pleased!This is not a family sized rice cooker. It's smaller than one expects. It might say a six cup cooker but 2 cups of basmati rice nearly filled half of the cooker once cooked.It works for my needs, is convenient, easy to clean and quite an efficient little cooker! Perfect! Thanks to the other reviewers who wrote such good reviews that I decided to take a chance!"
4,Pretty nice rice cooker for those don't cook a lot,"I eat rice occasionally. So I don't want to spend to much on traditional rice cooker both in money and space. This set serves this purpose pretty nicely. It's light, cheap, small and easy to use. The only cons is the lid, which is not very easy to clean up after cooking. Even if you have a dishwasher."
1,Just didn't make the best rice.,"I really hate to give low stars on products that I buy. I really wanted to love this microwave rice cooker, but I it wouldn't fully cook my rice. I ended up with a mix of cooked and halfway cooked rice. I followed the directions. I set the water to the right amount and set the microwave timer correctly. It might have been my microwave because I have a 800 watt microwave and the times in the directions seem to be made for 1000 watt microwaves. At any rate, for me, I kept it and will use it when I replace my microwave for a higher watt and I hope the rice will cook better. For now, I will use my stovetop pressure cooker to cook my rice."
1,Till i Die is Rubbish,"This cd is a lyrical disaster. When you actually sit down and try to listen what ""Mr. Shadow"" is talking about it is nothing but killing people, which i doubt he ever has. The beat can only keep me interested for 10 seconds and when he talks about San Diego it sounds like hes never been to the place. This cd is horrible please reconsider buying it."
5,an excellent stress-release gentle workout to do at home,"This video allows the beginner through to the more advanced yoga-fan to unwind, relax, and tone up in the comfort of his/her own home. Molly Fox has a good teaching style that provides encouragement for those who are not 'fitness freaks' whilst allowing for development and improvement with each session. The nice thing is that you can do the exercises whenever you feel the need, without having to worry about whether or not there is a class on in your area - there is, any time you care to play the video."
1,Not what I Expected,After reading the previous reviews I decided to purchace this DVD. From the title and cover I thought that this was about stretching and relaxation. It was just another yoga program and was not specific to stretching or relaxation.
2,Very annoying instructor and no modifications given,"This video is only for those who are already very flexible. There were many positions I found quite difficult and no modifications were suggested. Additionally, Molly Fox has a very grating instruction style, to the point of almost singing her instructions. I wish I could send this video back, because I will never use it again."
5,From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com,"I love Melissa and Doug toys, they're always well-made and always thoughtful. They encourage learning and their pieces, made of natural material, not only hold up well but are environmentally friendly.This game is a particularly nice example. It's a classic wooden puzzle with a twist. Each bug has a magnet on it, and the players are given a ""butterfly net"" with a magnet hanging from it to use to draw the pieces out of the puzzle.One of our pieces did stick, but a quick rub around the edges with some sandpaper loosened it right up. The downside of using real materials is that wood does have a tendency to warp in humidity or dryness. That's a downside I'm willing to live with! Excellent toy!"
5,"It is great, works great, good deal, great product, would recommend it to anyone that was looking for something simular.","It is great, works great, good deal, great product, would recommend it to anyone that was looking for something simular."
3,Fishies,"sorry for the payment problems my card isnt working properly. now on with the review, i havent recieved the items yet but when they come in i will write a review then"
5,Brigadoon - the audio recording,"Far better to listen to the music than see the movie! The voices were beautiful, especially on ""There But For You Go I."""
5,"Luker sings like Astaire dances,","Are you kidding me? Luker singing ""Didn't you know, Tommy...."" I'd buy the album just for those few bars. I saw Luker sing in Phantom back in '89, didn't know a thing about her, then went to see The Secret Garden, and recognized the voice. I'm telling you, chills up the spine. Sure, she's good looking, but good looking ""singers"" are a dime a dozen. I saw her at the 92nd St Y with Sheldon Harnick and they went through a piece by Gershwin (I think it was) a few times, and I almost fell out of my chair listening to this woman sing. She can't sing everything (the Allen Room was pretty weak, but I fault the material), and she can't play sexy, but who cares? It's a voice that comes along once in a few decades. Buy the CD, and play it until it wears out. Astaire could dance, Luker can sing."
4,A Fine Recording,"I purchased this recording because of my love for John Mclinn's recording of Show Boat. As I expected, he did a fine job with Brigadoon. McGlinn again mixes in a good amount of dialog with the beautiful music of Brigadoon. This makes for a recording that should be enjoyed from the beginning to the end and not shuffled into a mix of music."
4,The great africa migration,"if you are not a wild life fun this is not for you, but for those who love african wild life buy this one. you will not regret as this animal are faced with dilema and survival crossing the crocodile infested river was a very chilling momment as one of the wilde beest is torn to pieces by the jaws of death at once 4to5 crocks feasting on this helpless animal as other came back to see or help but in vain. the other moment i enjoyed is of the mother defending the young ones from the jackals by turning 360 degree.but the end was victorias to the wildbeest and its young one.this is one of africa's big migration. this animal are always in danger from all four conners.heynners, jackals,crocks and of couse chitahs but there is no were this is shown including the lion it is all based on their journey.not much of the big 5 is shown attacking this wildebeest."
3,Eder is a Streisand Sound-alike,"And that's a good thing! She doesn't sound like she's had a lot of vocal coaching (don't know that), but she comes across as a power singer and I like her."
4,I like it but......,Ok so.. I have used this stuff forever.. and love it.. BUT recently I've found a problem..I'm a security guard and wear the typical law enforcement uniform..And I've noticed recently that it looks like I've got incredibly sweaty armpits.. but I don't. the underarms of my uniform look wet..I've decided that the only thing it could be is the deodorant.I'm severely obsessive compulsive and it bothers me to think that I may be sweaty and smell bad.. but it also bothers me that my deodorant is making me LOOK like I'm sweaty..but oh wellit's good deodorant and the only shirts I have this problem with are my uniform shirts..
2,Too little for your money,"It is not stated in the description, but there are only 38 minutes of music on this CD, making it less than half full! The low price is thus not much of a bargain."
4,fun but not as good as one or three,"Here we see more of his classics that show his genius. The standout songs are ""my pussin"" ""take your meat out muh rice"", ""no more calypsong"" a lovely social critique, ""no melda"" and ""mama this is mass""Overall you cant but help like this album"
3,1970's romance.,"20th Century Masters: Millennium Collection - The Best of Ray,Goodman, and BrownI enjoyed the harmonies and the great singing, however I only recognised one or two songs, so I did not enjoy the CD as much as I thought. I will play this CD again, maybe I will discover something I missed the first time."
1,Beginners Beware.....,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to branch out and try this....I was extremely disappointed. Molly doesn't use the names of the poses very often and will move without sharing what she is doing in detail. Therefore, you will be left in a pose waiting to move. She also does a lot of ""jumping"" - I found this obnoxious. Not at all the flowing Yoga I enjoy - beginners - this isn't for you. Try ""Crunch - The perfect Yoga Workout."" It's worth your money."
1,No Star Review,"If you would like a recycled aerobics, sports trainer person teaching yoga, then this is the DVD for you. I wasn't looking for a spiritual journey, but I object to the repackaging and marketing approach. I know this will sound disrespectful, take this as one person's opinion, I found the entire format a farce."
5,WWII Nostalgia,"I love this vocalist ! If you really want to create the perfect ambience for WWII nostalgia , play this wonderful woman's recordings from that era. Beautiful melodies and orchestrations fill this collection and you won't be disappointed . Buy it !!"
1,"Jeez, sorry guys!","I enjoy B movies as much as anyone. I have purchased many of the 50 movie packs and felt like I got my money's worth, however I have to say this collection is just plain bad. I should have listened to the other reviewers (aside from the reviews by the guys who made the movies)but so often I can find something I like in spite of bad reviews. The simple fact is the plots (what plots?) are not even mediocre, the acting is horrible, some worse than others, audio is bad, and so on and so on. Out of the bunch, the only one that even comes close to a movie in my opinion is Old Man. If you are interested in paying this for something that looks like your kids typed up the screenplay in an afternoon and made it with their camcorder in the backyard, by all means proceed. If you are expecting the kind of movie you might see on Mystery Science Theater, this isn't it. I can't imagine even the MST folks sitting through these. Sorry guys, I really tried to like them."
1,Avoid this micro budget disaster,"Audio is weak at best for the films.Picture quality for all films match my home video camera.Acting is much lower than Troma (not a good thing).Music drowns out all dialog.I read the good reviews so I purchased the video. At $6, an average of $1 should be a good deal but it is not. Buy if you find for $1.25 or lower.I suggest not buying anything from Pendulum."
1,crap don't buy person/ store watch without buying and seeime,why are stores selling this and stealing my money sernairo like patrick from spungebob gee why don't i make a movie da even elvia is showing better movie some movies that are old and newer are being sold for 5.00 if i bought a candy bar on sale for .50 and it was bad i'd return it telling but your selling on line i can't return that easy i'm trusting you and amazon
1,Boring & just BAD,"This whole collection is awful, don't waster your money. My husband and I love ""b-horrors"" but these collections are the worst of the worst. It looks like a junior-high film project at best and is literally shot in someone's basement. Plus unlike most other ""B-horror"" movies, it's just boring. Would not recommend even to ""b-horror movie"" lovers!"
4,You can't go wrong with this DVD Pack!,"With ""Depraved Degenerates"", you get six, count'em 6, Indie horror films. You can't go wrong with the price so low! If you are into Indie Films or B-Horror, this is the DVD pack for you!The film ""Suburban Sasquatch"" alone is worth the price with it's tongue-in-cheek humor, CG Special Effects and great acting from some of PA's finest local Indie actors. Then you get the other 5 movies as well! -- How can you go wrong?! I had a ball watching these films and it was so refreshing seeing six different styles of Indie Horror on 2 discs in one box. You can't even rent these movies individually cheaper than this! Not every film may be to your liking, but with 6 to choose from, I'm sure you'll soon have a favorite in there of your own!"
4,Great Resource,"This was the second book I used to prepare for this exam. The first was Craig Zaker's. Both had advantages - both had disadvantages. The disadvantage of this is its shear volume. It has so much material (all of it good) but if you are working on a time line it is a lot to work through.This book presents extensive exam preparation materials, going through section by section the requirements of the exam. It will help you learn to think and answer in ""Microsoft speak"".There are lots of materials out there if you just want to pass a certification exam, crams, sims, testking ... but if you really want to learn the materials, you need to work with it. This book with its wide range and extensive exercises will help you learn hands on. It is an excellent resource, and will be a reference book I use for years to come."
2,Not a good resource at all for the 70-290,"Waste of money if sole intention is for taking the 70-290. You're better off with the Admin companion or inside out 2003 book. Sections on Groups is horrendous. The worst part is how 30% of the practice material is not even covered in the book! Funny how all the practice questions themselves reference the admin companion/technet and not the book. Again, don't waste your money on this ""training kit"""
5,mcsa / mcse is exactly what I thought it would be.,It is nice to get a book and it is exactly what it say it is. A training kit. you have all that you need at your finger tip to learn.
4,MCSA/MCSE Self-Pace Training Kit (Exam 70-290),It goes in better depth with hands on labs to work with while you learn or fine tune for the test.
3,Was OK,Very well written story. Would recommend this to everyone. I've enjoyed this author for many years. You will have a great adventure with this story.
3,"Okay, but not great","I felt that this book was written very well and I enjoyed reading it. This book touches on everything that Windows Server 2003 has to offer. However, I would strongly advise using this in conjuction with other study materials if you are planning on taking the 70-290 exam. The practice questions in this book (and on the CD) are very good for real life situations that you will encounter as an administrator, but they are nothing like what you will encounter on the actual exam. I would suggest reading this book cover to cover doing all of the practice labs & questions, and then doing as many free practice questions as you can find online from a reputable source."
1,Didn't get Serial Key with c.d.,I'm very dissappointed as I didn't get a serial key with my book to install the training edition of Enterprise Server 2003. This has caused me to have to find someone with a valid copy of Enterprise and it hasn't been easy.
3,Finish your Phd before you try this one,"The author is obviously knowledgeable but the presentation, while concise, is difficult to grasp and to follow. He warns that the reader must have a firm understanding of the first chapter before going on with the rest of the book but this chapter requires reading and rereading to get a half decent understanding.I have 3 college degrees so I am not a dummy but I will admit I am not super smart so maybe it is just me. Still, I am glad I bought the book and have read it twice with the intent of reading it again a couple more times. I would recommend the book but would advise the reader to be patient and expect to read it as one would read a text book."
4,Fine Tune your Elasticity Knowledge,"I used this book as a supplement to another book my professor was using for instruction. This book seemed to discuss the topics better than my professor, but that is not too hard. Good examples, but at times the examples jumped numerous steps that were needed in order to understand how to do the problem by yourself."
3,Mistaken identity,"I just purchased this album thinking it was the band Gush, formerly The Murmurs. It is not. Completely different band. I was misled, because the section that said ,""People who bought this album also bought:"" contained The Murmurs and the L Word soundtracks. Just a word of caution so no one will make the same mistake I made.On the music of the actual cd, if you like late '90s heavy guitar music, it's not bad. The vocals reminded me of 7 Mary 3. Not bad music, just not what I was expecting."
3,Not Sealab 2021,"I also came here looking for the Murmurs new band, which this is apparently not (I guess there is also a Swedish trio that uses the name Gush). I would have just moved on, but I have to respond to the review mentioning Sealab 2021. I have no idea what that reviewer is talking about, because the Sealab 2021 theme was done by the band Calamine. They sound much closer to the Murmurs than a 90's hair metal band, so I just want to clarify this point. You can find Calamine (although they may be defunct) and download the Sealab 2021 theme song at calamine.com .I haven't listened to the album in question, so disregard my rating."
3,Worth a listen for Indigo Girl types,"""Firewater"" begins with two female voices strongly singing the following, punctuated only by a few drum beats and piano chords:""I've been your pride, I've been your shame, a wall of stone, I've been a tide of love and pain, your sweetest home, I made your bed, I watched you sleep, I've been your wicked dreams, I've been your bread, I've been your meat, Do you know what it means?""Then the song kicks in a steady rock beat, full instrumentation, and a fairly catchy melody.In general, this CD features two women harmonizing to songs with a rock quality. It was released in the 90's but has a 70's influence. It contains some lesbian references (""When Sappho breathed upon me...""), but most of the songs have more universal themes. If you like female harmonies with a rock beat and a touch of angst, this is a decent CD to have in your collection."
2,Bigger budget does not always make a better movie,"After the success of ""Goldfinger"", the Bond producers secured the film rights to ""Thunderball"" and tripled the budget. The basic plot is simple but good: Largo, working for Spectre, steals atomic missiles and demands a ransom. Unfortunately, ""Thunderball"" is considerably longer than the previous movies, but there's less plot. The script is dull and the direction lifeless. Most of the budget seems to have been spent on the underwater sequences. But they're not well made, only chaotic and go on for way too long. They become the anticlimax of a movie that had already lost my interest. ""Thunderball"" is one of the few Bond movies that manages to bore me. Not recommended."
2,Kinda boring and Sean Connery doesn't care to be in the film,"This movie is the first to show that Sean Connery didn't care anymore about being James Bond. His acting is flat and the writing is kinda dull, kinda boring... it's a snooze fest. Dr. No, From Russia with Love and especially Goldfinger are much, much better films. Buy those and not this one. By all means though, if you are having trouble sleeping, buy it. You'll be out cold before Tom Jones finishes singing the opening theme. All in all a major let down after the first 3 films."
1,cover art shock! (Blu-ray Disc),"Is this a joke? The Highest End 1080p Blu-ray version for eternity of a long row of versions of this beautiful Bond classic with a bad looking and, worse, mirror-image picture of Sean Connery on the cover?? Who decides this?? This is world cinema of global player companies, and they can't afford a graphic designer!! The only reason can be, they want the film to look ""different"" for the supermarket-mass-audience buyer, might work. When I remember the care that went into the THUNDERBALL Laserdisc Box in 1997 using unused but beautiful cover art. Similar treatment with the cover on the FOR YOUR EYES ONLY Blu-ray with a Roger image not from that film (too young)."
2,THUNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDAAAAAAABBBBAAAAL sucked!,"I hated this movie. I hated this movie. Did I mention I hated this movie. Sean Connery looked half-asleep in this absolutly no action very graphic ending movie. Even for the 1960s the special effects stunck. The ending sequence where Largo has a harpoon in his back the boat looks like it's going about 500 mph. The only cool parts were where the Disco Vilante blows up by hittig a rock and, where the motorcycle fires a missle at the blue ford w/ Bond's DB5 nearby. I hated this movie."
3,"Good, not Great Bond","THUNDERBALL * * * I've been catching up on the widescreen DVDs of the old Bond films and this one isn't up to ""Goldfinger"" and ""Her Majesty's Secret Service"" because it's a little draggy at times but it's redeemed by an action-packed last half-hour underwater battle."
5,James Bond=Entertainment,"I have been a fan ever since I was 9. THis was the first movie I had ever seen, and seeing it on DVD really made it look terrific. The sound and the effects were really spectacular. I also recommend Thunderball and Goldeneye on DVD."
4,"bond 'innovateur', bond 'explosive'","The ulitmate Bond continues to charm his way through another adventure! Many sights and sounds in this re-master! Trevor Young makes a comeback and follows in the footsteps of Guy Hamilton's success. Young, challenges the series and makes it even more contemporary for its time, with very successful results! Quick-paced, a multi-cast and villainous, it's very entertaining and becomes a staple for the Bond series. The editing is great, except for an awkward carnival chase scene. The story drags towards the last third part of the movie, but with fantastic underwater sequences that were probably one of their kind up to that point and an explosive, exciting ending, we are definitely entertained!"
5,Here Comes The Biggest Bond of All!,"They went all out on this movie in '65. Connery looks great. Great action. Largo-the best villain. Good dubbing. Has there ever been better underwater action ssequences before? A big score by the one and only John Barry. Play it loud. Hopefully this DVD will look as good as the special edition version laser disc. That thing has everything! Commentary, different themes, documentaries,etc. And it looks beautiful! The best photography of any Bond film. Rated #2 on my Bond list. It's just fun!"
5,Here Comes The Biggest Bond Of All!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"By far the best and most exciting of the series. Connery at his suavest,action sequences,and location filming make this film a must see. Truly ahead of it's time in content and ingenuity. The underwater sequences alone are worth the price!Excellent supporting cast,especially Adolfo Celi as Largo and Luciana Paluzzi as Fiona.Wonderful nemesis!Claudine Auger was one of the most beautiful of the bond girls!"
4,Pretty Good,"This was a little dissapointing because the movie dragged and dragged on after the Warheads were captured. Then it started to pick up when we got to the Bahamas. The actions scenes were pretty good except when Bond breaks into Largos home. The underwater battle was awsome. And the end fight between Largo and Bond was cool too. If you like smart action adventure movies, buy or rent Thunderball."
5,Big Bond,"One of Bond's most beautiful films ever. The underwater footage, specially the one when the Vulcan is ""buried"", is amazing. Memorable, a classic. The plot is very well orchestrated too. The DVD contains valuable extras, with things that'll make you consider how hard a life Sean Connery had when facing real sharks just to be Mr. Bond. Maybe that's why he IS Bond. Maybe that's what made these films a great entertainment even 30 years after its first release. Maybe that's why computer generated acting, like on Star Wars: Episode One, is so frustrating, boring and dissapointing after you've seen REAL action films like this. Certainly a must buy, along with Goldfinger and Golden Eye, for those who like James Bond films. Or just wonderful films."
4,Essential Bond,"After the phenomenal success of ""Goldfinger,"" Bondmania reached its box-office peak with this spectacular 1965 adventure. Though the adaptation by Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins is needlessly complicated in spots, ""Thunderball"" has all the requisite 007 elements: Sean Connery's classic performance, solid direction from Terence Young, an impressive supporting cast, and John Barry's memorable score. The first widescreen Bond production makes the most of its Bahaman locales and John Stears' Oscar-winning visual effects. Slightly overlong, ""Thunderball"" is a notch below the previous 007 films, but well worth having."
4,A 100% Show Stopper,"This Spy Movie re-defines all the rest. No one does it like Sean Connery and the music score is one for the record books. The fight scenes are very realistic and the cool-like attitude of Mr Bond even in tight situations in this movie is enough to make you watch it over and over. After Sean Connery, other Bond movies are fun to watch, but they lack the hall mark performance the he delievers."
4,"Great!,... 4-and-a-half Stars!!","I really like this movie, it has one of the better plots of any of the Bond films(SPECTRE has highjacked 2 nuclear bombs and holds NATO ransom with them), great action sequences (especially the underwater, spear-gun fight at the end), great acting(connery's best performance), and the best Bond villain ever, SPECTRE! I highly reccomend THUNDERBALL to Bond fans and those who like spy, sneaking-around, type movies, because there's a whole lot of it. This is a really good movie, not as good as it's predessecor, GOLDFINGER, but it is still worth buying."
4,Bond In Paradise,"Another action packed Bond with Sean Connery where the playboy spy goes off to paradise to save the world from sinister villains. A fun Bond with all of the standard quips, archvillains and Bond Bunnies.Bond is off to the Bahamas to find the location of a crashed NATO bomber carrying nuclear bombs. Standing out in the tropical paradise is SPECTER's second in command, Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi) who has lavish parties in his villa and disposes of unwelcome guests in his shark-infested sealable swimming pool. After seducing Laro's sexy mistress, Domino (Claudine Auger), Bond follows Largo to uncover his organization's sinister plan.A good Bond with plenty of sea-faring adventures both above and below water. Bond is of course equipped with his standard gadgets with the help of MI-6's uptight gadgetmaster ""Q"" (Desmond Llewelyn.) Another Connery Bond film worth several viewings."
5,This shocked me!,"I reluctantly rented this movie because my friends said it stunk.They were way wrong!It is the best Bond movie,beating out Goldfinger,You Only Live Twice,and Octopussy.Buy this one,you'll love it!"
5,Thunderball (50th Anniversary Repackage),"There isn't much difference between the other cover and the new ones except the cover and the cover of the disk. I can't see any new features, but there are features and my Blu-ray didn't come with any interesting inserts except for a paper about the new 007 video game. Other then that the quality of the movie is great and I'd recommend this. If your not sure what version to get I'd recommend finding the cheapest out of the two."
5,The greatest Bond?,"While many rank GOLDFINGER as the best Bond ever, THUNDERBALL has always been my favorite. To me it had all the Bond ingredients (gadgets, lots of sharks, the Aston Martin, scuba diving, gorgeous babes & plenty of action) as well as a cohesive plot. Spectre remains one of the most formidable villains in Bond history, even after all these years.The underwater brawl between the Spectre divers and the Navy(?) divers remains a classic climactic scene in all of the Bond movies. I'm just guessing that they were Navy (SEALS?) as usually Army guys are not trained in scuba operations.Connery's final Bond movie, NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN, was more-or-less a remake of THUNDERBALL. There were a few variations here & there, but the basic plotline & many of the elements remained the same. This goes to show just how enduring THUNDERBALL was to the Connery Bond movies."
5,Very good...,"The video quality for the Blu-ray was great considering how old the movie is. You can see the grains/noise in the scenes, but tolerable. Definitely better than DVD transfer and overall good. The sound quality was excellent."
3,"Good, but not exactly great","This film would have been much better if the underwater scenes had been shorter. However, it is still a good movie. SPECTRE is back in action, with Ernst Stavro Blofeld in charge, but still faceless to the audience. SPECTRE hijacks two nuclear weapons, and threatens to use them unless a considerable ransom is paid. Bond gets a clue about the situation at a health spa, and uses it to track down Blofeld's number 2 man Largo. Felix Leiter is also back, though the producers can't seem to keep one actor in the role constantly.All in all, the plot is good, there are interesting characters, and Connery is still the top Bond. The film just seems to drag on a bit toward the end, due mainly to the underwater scenes."
4,Non-Stop Fighting and Romance in a Dire Situation -,"It's Bond vs. Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion (SPECTRE) again, this time involving a hijacked nuclear bomber with two weapons. The bombs are being used for ransom, but James' intrepid sleuthing and non-stop fighting/killing saves the day. In between more than a few women are seduced - including a few on SPECTRE's side."
4,No DTS Sound,This review is on the Bluray ed. of thunderball. The picture clarity is a little better than dvd version but the DTS MASTER sound doesn't work.I have other blurays that use DTS and they work. has anyone had a similar problem? i puchased it from a seller and not directly from amazon.
4,thunderball,"first:this movie holds up well for a movie that dates back to 1965!i still say sean connery was the best bond.this blu-ray verson blows the dvd away!dr no has a higher bit rate and is the best of the bunch so far,but thunderball is right behind it pq wise.the audio[dtshdma]is ok not much in the surrounds but again this movie was mono in 1965.if you collect bond,go for it!"
4,Thunderball Strikes Big!,"SPECTRE is back, and 007 has got'em. This time SPECTRE plots to steal two atomic bombs and hold the world for ransom (a situation still very real for the world today). A bit underrated by some James Bond movie fans, but I think it just gets better with age. Sean Connery's personal favorite! Still has the right stuff as James Bond. Has by far the best looking bevy of Bond girls ever to grace the silver screen! Claudine Auger, is my Bond Dream Girl as good-girl Domino. Lucianna Paluzzi, lusciously evil as the first true Bond femme-fatale! Adolpho Celi, a scary and most formidable opponent. Awesome production values, classic witicisms (""I think he got the point""), spectacular underwater action, and another classic John Barry score make this Bond effort a total splash!****1/2 out of *****"
3,BEWARE! Underwater battle edited.,"This review is not for the Blue Ray edition, which I have not seen. The underwater battle in this DVD is a clipped version of the original. Several shots have been excised from the last third of the sequence. This is very noticeable due to the change in the music. I compared it with my old VHS tape and the version on this supposedly definitive version has been edited.I have since obtained the Blue Ray and it also has the edited version of the underwater battle."
3,Better Than Average Bond,"Thunderball has two things going for it: 1) an interesting underwater battle at the film's climax, and 2) Claudine Auger as Domino Derval. She wins my vote as theeeeeee most attractive of the Bond girls. Largo was also a better than average villain. What Thunderball lacks is an interesting henchman for the villain like Oddjob in Goldfinger or Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker. There aren't many interesting gadgets either. Otherwise the film is faithful to the Bond formula and is worth seeing."
3,Thunderball (special edition),"James bond movies are not great movies, but good entertainment. I like when comedy is associated with this kind of movies. The violence is always the least I like, but it is a part of all James Bond movies and it is on the fantasy side, so it is okay I guess."
4,A good introduction to a classic strategic bomber.,"This is a well-presented and useful introduction to anyone interested in the B-52 bomber. Its only drawback in my view is that being printed before recent crises such as the 1991 Gulf War and the 1999 Kosovo crisis, the action of B-52s in recent years are not featured. But if not I liked this book, its text as well as the excellent photographs. line drawings and colour plates."
1,Will Never Buy GE again,"As soon as the unit was out of warranty, the plastic on the handle started to crack, then the plastic around the door. I called GE and they told me I was SOL. I could pay $200 to have a technician come and replace the door or I could buy another one- at retail. They would not replace nor fix for free- which they should have if they knew anything about customer service. Talk about failing to stand by their product- which was junk!! They also told me that I should stop using it immediately or I would send radioactive waves to everyone in my home. I want nothing to do with GE ever again. A complete waste of money."
1,"A Real ""Dud""","I thought my 6 year old grandaughter would like this game since she loves computer games and she also loved the movie ""Monsters,Inc"". Wrong... She wasn't able to play it, was completely bored, and even her dad found it to be a real ""dud"". Don't waste your money when there's games available like Freddie Fish or Putt-Putt which cost the same and are really great to play!!"
5,Great party games with multiple pigs!,"We have 4 of these pigs and we have so much fun with them at parties. We've had a pig toss contest, a medical emergency game, etc. Everyone loves this thing!!!"
4,Who wouldn't love a toy that cleans up after itself???,My son got this for his 2nd birthday and had a blast dumping out and sweeping up the Legos. I love it too! I can imagine that he'll soon be sweeping all kinds of small toys with it!
4,service,This item was as ordered; as described; well packed; fast delivery; I would purchase again from this seller.
5,fabulous,"This is a great product, wish it was available year around where I live. Shipping was expensive but the product is worth it"
5,incredible CD,"I've owned this CD for a very long time, yet I still play it often. Soothing and exhilarating at the same time."
4,The usual high level of excellence from this group,"If you enjoy mid-Renaissance music, you'll like this CD. The Consort is in fine voice and the selection covers a wide variety of cultures that were Portugal in the 15th Century, from the aristocrats to the gypsies to the Jews. Very pleasant collection."
5,Life ~ what an outstanding book,I saw this featured on The Today Show and purchased it. The book and photos are unbelievable! Our whole family has enjoyed looking through the book and learning about the human body and development. If you enjoy these types of books you don't want to miss this one!
5,Fasinating,This is an absolutely beautiful book! I was looking for pictures for our Children's Ministry regarding Life in the Womb and this book has been an awesome answer to my search. The vivid colors and details - It has so much more than what I expected.
4,Very Pleased with Life,I just loved this highly graphic and colorful rendition of the human body - one can almost see the soul through Nilsson's insightful photography! A fabulous gift for anyone curious about the art form of the human body.
3,The book itself was awesome,"The book was awesome I have seen it before that is why i purchased, the condition it was in was not as described there were torn pages and I will not by used again"
1,Ratty Rat Pack,I bought this CD for my Mother-in-law as a holiday gift and she just told me that one of the two discs did not work when she got it. I am dissappointed that an inferior product was shipped by Amazon and would like to return it for a replacement. I have otherwise always been satisfied with what I buy on Amazon
5,It's Here,"This is it. If you love the Rat Pack for more than just their music, this is the collection for you. My wife an I have it playing everytime we entertain, just to liven up the mood. It's a great CD with great performances and the DVD is hysterical. It's about time they came out with something that gives the people what they want. Buy it, watch it, listen to it, love it. You will not be disappointed."
4,"Fun, but not enough music","It is a fun cd full that really gives you a peek at what it was like to be at one of the Rat Pack's performances. But it is a little lacking in the music area for me. A bit too much laughing anc cutting up, but that's why you buy the live cd isn't it?"
5,Goody Goody!,"One show on Cd, and the other on DVD. One from Chicago and one from St. Louis. Very entertaining. Those guys were fabulous."
4,ratpack,"great concert if only they were still around today, would of loved to of lived in that era. music for the ages"
5,Peel Sessions +,"Despite London Records insistance that the Heart & Soul boxset would have every Joy Division recording on it, it didn't. It left out some key Peel Sessions (all collected here) and what was on Still. This disc also collects some other BBC sessions, but really, little in the popular music canon of the past 25 years can compare with these songs, some of which (Transmission) appear in their most realized recorded states.As a bonus, the Peel version of Love Will Tear Us Apart is slightly different but just as good as the various released versions. Give this CD to someone who's only ever heard Nine Inch Nails and watch them become the toast of the underground rock community. Give it to someone who was there and watch a tear roll down their eyes. An excellent re-release. In summary, perfect music."
4,Something Else,"Is there such a thing as a bad Joy Division album or song? Simple answer--no there isn't. But I feel this album does not deserve a pristine 5 stars. The songs roar with raw energy and pure darkness. But without the production skills of Martin Hannett, the band sounds a bit more ammatuerish compared to the final sessions of each song on here. With that being said, it is very important to igknowledge that these song provide a fantastic contrast to the polished Hannett versions and provide better outlook to the bands' live sound--hey, that's what Peel Sessions are for. Colony hits hard with deep, tense, abstract motions...The interview was cut short and was supposed to have Martin Hannett speaking also. What really is tops about this album are the ""Something Else"" TV performance of Transmission and She's Lost Control. While the sound quality/mix isn't perfect, these are without a doubt the best captured performances of these two songs--studio or live. Simply Phenominal...."
2,"Don't buy this, get the imported version of the Best of Joy Division instead.","The rating above does not reflect my views on the importance or the quality of this release. John Peel's radio sessions often caused bands to reimagine and recreate their music in new and challenging ways, and Joy Division is no exception. All of these versions, with the band performing these songs live-in-the-studio, give a fresh perspective on the originals since these contain little overdubs, compared to their studio counterparts.My 2-star review reflects the case that this is out of print, very rare, and quite expensive when found. The actual album itself has been re-released as the bonus disc on the UK version of The Best of Joy Division, which is still in print and available, and cheaper as well. All of the songs on here are available on that, even the interview with Ian Curtis and Stephen Morris. Overall, I suggest you do buy this album, only in that format."
2,Wish I was there.,"""Live in Copenhagen"" is relatively entertaining; I have trouble imagining a Buckley concert not being at least entertaining. However, Buckley does nothing new, so I estimate the cd is not worth buying. Buckley gives a good performance, and the band is alright, but it's extremely hard to tell how good the performance was because of the poor recording--definitely the worst recording quality in the Buckley canon. The concert would probably have sounded 10 times better live than on this recording. If the sound had been recorded flawlessly, it still would have been twice as good live. It just serves to remind me that the magic of music lies in making music for the moment at hand, and letting the moment own it; having it on record is just a cheap thrill."
4,"The,Copenhagen Tapes- a jazzy delight","Recorded on 12 October 1968, a mere five days after ""Dream Letter Live in London 1968"" ( the date on the sleeve notes of Dream Letter is wrong) this sounds like a huge step forward. Whilst ""Dream Letter"" includes some of Buckley's folk based material as a sop to his past and the London audience, as well as hinting at his future jazzy direction, this CD goes the whole hog into his future. ""I don't need it to rain"" glides effortlessly through 21 minutes of soulful changes backed by double bass, vibes and Lee Underwood's electric guitar while Buckley's voice swoops and soars and caresses. ""Buzzin' Fly"" is similar to the studio version on ""Happy Sad"", ""Strange Feelin'"" and ""Gypsy Woman"" both soar off in new directions from previous versions. 4 stars because of only 4 tracks and an audible hiss from the original tapes but all in all a superb album."
4,good variety of songs,i dig the variety of songs chosen for the covers. wildly different styles and tempos but all are good and some are great. i have to give it 4 stars because some of my favorite songs aren't covered but i like more of the obscure stuff anyways. overall this is pretty good.
2,pointless,"there are a couple of passable covers on this, but the point escapes me. if someone wants to gain exposure to elliott's music, buy either/or and go from there. new moon (primarily outtakes/extras from that session) is also a good introduction. the icing on the cake for this tribute is the cover of thirteen, which is a big star song. aside from being a cover of a cover, this version is truly awful."
1,"Well, they had good intentions","Maybe if they had chosen bands with more character that would cover an Elliott Smith song with a little flavor this cd would have been better. I listened to It 3 times all the way through just to make sure I wasnt missing something, and I wanst. Nothing worth hearing here. at least they had good intentions."
5,"Happy in Gilbert, AZ",Our faucets are 13 years old. Was worried about finding replacement parts. Was happy to get these at a great price and good delivery time. Product is as advertised.
4,Great sturdy heavy built treadmill,"I am very pleased with the Weslo Cadence C44 treadmill. I didn't want to spend over $450 on a treadmill but I thought if I did this that the treadmill would be flimsy, cheap and not well built. Much to my surprise this thing is very sturdy, heavy and densely built and a breeze to operate. The assembly was fairly straight forward if you follow simple instructions correctly. It took me about 1.5 - 2 hours to assemble (you only need to assemble both upright rails, hand rails and console). In some instances the instructions recommended that you have another person assist you. However, with some imagination, practical safety procedures and some muscle (I used a stack of books to keep the base up in order to screw in the frame bolts), I was able to assemble it by myself and I'm a 52 yr. old female. The treadmill is very sturdy and easy to fold up and store. For the money this thing is certainly worth it. I know I'll get many years of enjoyment and satisfaction from it."
4,"VERY GOOD VALUE TREADMILL, GOOD MANUFACTURER SERVICE","I am very happy with this treadmill.It took me about 2 hours to assemble.But the power did not turned on.I called the manufacturer who answered me right away, and gave instructions explaining to tighten up some loosing devices, and then the power went on.Weslo does answer and help u with any problem, i think this is VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW."
2,Disappointed,"I bought my Weslo Treadmill yesterday afternoon, a Friday, and I was so excited. My friend and I spend about an hour putting this thing together only to find out it doesn't even work!!!!! The power turned on but no motor. We took it apart to make sure everything was connected and again, didn't work. I called the service number only to find out that no one could help me until Monday! I'm pretty upset that I have a brand new machine in my home that doesn't even work. We'll see how this works out but as of today, I am extremely upset about this purchase."
2,Good treadmill but difficult to assemble,Once you get this put together...This is a rather difficult assembly. It took two people 90 minutes to get together. Leave the zip ties in place (I did this and still lost a nut that I was unable to connect to this day). Connecting the control panel was the most difficult. Next was connecting the base to the belt housing was the second most difficult. Plan on two people and a lot of time to get this together. When you are using it the tread mill is louder than most other units. It also is a little unsteady - because I couldn't get the last nut to hold the head unit on. Over all I would purchase again - only because it was the cheapest on at the store. The next model up has little more to offer and was 100.00 more expensive. Good luck & especially good luck putting this thing together!
4,Teacher's Treadmill,"The treadmill works well enough, however, it arrived in a very large, heavy box that I had to drag through my house and assemble. The packaging wasn't very good because the front of the base of the treadmill was broken where the UPS driver dropped it and the screws were scattered throughout the box. It was very difficult to assemble and I have experience assembling all kinds of things but this takes the cake. In the end though, the treadmill works fine."
3,nothing new,"without the song nothing sacred this cd would probably get only one star,music has a touch of disturbed anf tool"
2,...,"I can not believe the reviews that compare this band to the greatness of Tool (the best band on earth). Tool does have a lot of meaning behind thier songs and that is great that is one of the reasons why Tool is so great other than Maynards great vocals and Danny's awsome drums, but unlike Memento, Tool is capable of sending this message without being preachy about it. If you come in during the middle of some of these songs You could swear you were listening to Christian rock. Save yourself some money and get something else. The only song that is worth hearing on here is ""Nothing Sacred"""
4,One of the Few New Bands Worth Listening To,"I checked out the CD because I thought ""Nothing Sacred"" was a good song & I heard good things about this band on Ozzfest. I found that the whole CD is pretty consistent & each song is pretty well crafted and executed.The first thing I typically look for in any rock band is if the lead singer can actually sing. The lead singer (Justin) can definitly sing and his voice comes across as passionate. Also, the lyrics are not mindless like several other things out now.The band strikes a pretty fair balance between heaviness & the slower ballad type music. Nothing something easily done. Each song is listenable, even the almost 13 minute last track ""Figure 8"" doesn't seem like it goes on that long. It just kind of flows.Overall, a great album for fans of hard rock. I hope these guys can keep it up over time because a lot of rock out now just sucks..."
2,"Talented, but confused - nothing special","This album sounds like someone who knows how to play instruments and can sing half decent went into a studio and recorded some songs.. they have some skills, but the lyrics and arrangement need some work. I don't know that I'll even listen to it again. There's not anything special about any of these songs."
5,beginnings is just the beginning of the end of the beginning,"depth, ability, searching, emotive music that moves. A complete record from start to finish."
2,certainly not what I was expecting,"This album didn't nearly meet my expectations. I still give it two stars though, since it has some memorable moments, such as ""Beginnings"" and ""Blister"". Aside from that, however, I find it to be utterly boring and far from unique. Unless you're just desperate for new music, I wouldn't recommend this album."
1,WOW! WHAT TRASH!,"This is so bad, I am really sorry I bought it. I hope no one out there makes the same mistake I did by buying this record. Oh and my friend saw this band and said they were a joke. My advise is: DON'T BUY THIS RECORD!! IT IS BAD!!"
1,...,"P.U. Take my advise this is a records co. way to try and cash in on a great band. They tryed to create a sound real close to tool, but they failed. There is only one tool out there, these copy-cat bands smell. I would think they would like to invent there own sound, but i guess it is soooo much more easy to live on the shirt tail of another band. So if you like a very poor version of a great band then buy it, if you like great music, great vocals, then dont buy. This band needs to flush the whole cd and start fresh, then flush themselves cuz they still would suck!!!!!"
5,Here's where Memento went:,"Memento have changed their name to Nine Times Bodyweight. You can hear new songs at www.myspace.com/ninetimesbodyweight. This cd is amazing, ranging from the heavy rock of Nothing Sacred, Abyss, and Coming, to the softer progressive Beginnings and Blister. A Great hard rock cd."
4,pretty decent,"I think this cd is pretty good. If you think it is going to all be like ""Nothing Sacred"" it is not. Most of it is much better. It is a very emotional and unique sounding cd."
2,blah...,"This cd isnt that great. The first song is good the other ones are just ok. another recviewer said that they sound like TOOL, i own all of TOOLs albums and they arnt comparable they dont even come close. An ok album if you have money to waste."
3,Possible one-hit wonders.,"Quite an auspicious debut. While Nothing Sacred shakes the fluid out of your head with a momentous barrage of heavy bass and drums, the rest of the album seems strangely lacking. It feels as though once the collective songwriters in the band cranked out two or three radio worthy cuts, the well of creativity completely dried up. There is nothing on this disk that cannot be found on any Staind, Nonpoint, Korn, or Chevelle album, and the latter bands seem to do it much better.Standout Tracks:Nothing Sacred"
1,the other reviews were writen by the band,this is so bad. this is possibly the worst thing I have ever heard. I pitty the protools guy who had to work on this 'music'.
2,Weird Foreign Crap.,"Like the last guy said, Nothing Sacred is such a bad@$$ hard rock song it makes you wonder what these guys were thinking when they threw the rest of the album together. There's a few hard rock/metal attempts but they all suck and none of them are effective in the least, with the exception of Nothing Sacred..definitely one-hit wonder status for these guys."
5,Flawless,"This album is 175% flawless. Seriously, if you are even remotely into metal then this album should be in your collection. From its technicality to its catchy as hell hooks. When I'm not listening to this album, I'm thinking about listening to it."
2,Great Concept; Terrible Equipment,"I used to purchase/rent videos through Clean Films. I loved the editing quality Clean Films offered, but since they are no longer in business, a friend recommended ClearPlay. ClearPlay comes up slightly short of the Clean Films editing quality, but I still love the concept and in fact have enjoyed the experience for as long as the DVD player worked. The problems with the DVD player started by not responding to the remote, then moved on to stating there was no filter found, though it was downloaded and the player would play the ClearPlay version of the movie. However, it has finally come to the point whereas now I can't even get it to open/close to watch the DVDs anymore. Good Concept, but I wish the hardware was up to par."
2,"It's sleaze, but it's FUN sleaze ...","The author, a free-lance wine writer not widely regarded as a heavyweight, has done a National Enquirer treatment of Napa and its leading wine personalities, reprinting a lot of rumors, quoting a lot of unnamed sources. Never mind. It's a helluva read. Just don't take it too seriously."
2,Stay away if you have knee problems!!,"This workout is extremely boring. Molly Fox repeats the same routines over and over again--you will be thoroughly tired of Sun Salutation. My knees aren't the best ever, so this workout which is heavy on bending exercises is too much. If you have knee problems from running, jogging or weights-- stay clear of this tape-- it won't really help you while you're recuperating."
2,Not as I expected,"This seems to me as a low production tape with no attention to details. In regard to the workout, I can say that it is OK but not Great!"
5,Enjoying A Thousand Shall Fall (Shiloh Legacy),"I started reading the book two nights ago and true to Bodie Thoene's style, I was drawn in right away. The buying and receiving transaction was good; no problems. I recommend the book and the seller."
4,Surprising,This cd was such a great suprise...The songs really took me back. I can't wait for the next one..It was definitely worth it...
1,Incomplete Book!,I bought this book for the information on decoction mashing. Imaging my surprise and dismay when I found out the entire chapter on decoction was missing! Pages 103-134 are not there! Another reviewer had the same problem! Amazon: please pull this book from your site until the publisher can get his act together and print the ENTIRE book as written!
3,"Brewing, yes. Radical, no.","In the author's unreasonable fear to have his right to free speech stripped away, he makes a lot of compromises in the ""radical"" department in order to avoid lawsuits. As a brewing guide, this is a fun and informative book, but if you are looking for something that challenges the norm of home brewing and American perspectives on it look elsewhere. I suggest starting with the following book:Sacred and Herbal Healing Beers: The Secrets of Ancient Fermentation"
1,Incomplete-Pages missing,Pages 103 - 134 missing and there is a duplication of pages 134 - 166. Poor quality control on the publishers part.
5,Great book and essential addition to your Homebrewing library,"I haven't finished reading this book I have been reading various sections I had curiosity in. Then realized this is actually a pretty good read, it goes through various sections explaining how certain typs of beer were brewed in the past (hundreds of years ago we're talking here) as well as the recipes for these beers. He also covers in detail typs of hops and what they do to your beer and your hops and barley as well as how to roast/smoke them yourself.Anyways to shorten this I think its a great addition to your homebrew library and essential addition to How to Brew: Everything You Need To Know To Brew Beer Right The First Time which is a perfect reference manual."
4,expand your brew palate,"This book is well written with lots of humor, historical information, and new flavors with which to experiment. It teaches beyond the typical malt and hops recipes of 2 dimensional beers and introduces a broad range of new flavors and techniques to paint a more beautiful a complex beer. Even though there are probably hundreds of unorthodox ingredients discussed, there are still some left out... what about lemongrass, Mosher?"
4,I Love It!,"It is not an easy game at first. But who wants to win a game right out of the box. Once you get the knack of using the arrow keys to move around the obstacles, it is lots of fun. I am actually addicted. Can't wait to get home and start playing again."
1,Save your $$$$$$,"I bought if for my 4 year old, and she lost intrest in less than 5 minutes. When an adult has a rough time playing it - it has to be bad! Keep looking for something else to play."
3,not that great,i expected a cute little nursery rhyme book for my nephew but it seems like the pictures used could be a little more animated to attract young readers attention.
5,"Great shirt, great service.",Awesome shirt. I get alot of comments. Mostly from children. Old Glory is a terrific vendor.
1,Versa-Pak NiCad - Worst EVER,"I have several Versa-Pak tools, which I really like. They are small and versatile, and get the job done when I need a quick power tool. No good for building a deck, but great for simple fixes around the house. However, I have to say these Versa-Pak NiCad batteries are just the worst rechargeable batteries ever made. They will completely die somewhere within 6 months to 2 years of purchasing them. I purchased 2 of the 2-pack/charger kits (4 batteries), and that's what mine did. I subsequently replaced them with the NiMH batteries (which work with the same chargers), and they work like a charm. Stick with the NiMH batteries, and avoid the NiCads like the plague. This 6-pack may seem like a good deal, but how good is it if you'll be recycling the entire set in a year?"
5,The Best Greek Grammar!,This must be the definitive Greek Grammar! Everything you could want to know about Greek while learning the language is here.
5,The Twelfth Garfield Fat Cat 3 Pack,I think Jim Davis out did himself this time! Outragously funny!I even gat a detention durring reading class from laughing so hard!!!!
2,Yikes - this looks daunting!,"As a beginning learner, I expected this book to be a bit more structured vs diving right into complex sentences and phrases.For me personally, this book would have been more helpful to focus on everyday usage in the office place, as opposed to focusing on a specfic business situation (financial turnaround).For intermediate speakers already accustomed to the language, you may find this book useful. If you are just starting, look for something else to give you grounding before taking this book on. My two star rating is more my missed expectation and level of learning, vs what the book can deliver."
1,A Self Indulgent Author describes a Self Centered Killer.,"I was interested in reading this book after seeing an interview with the author (Stephen Singular) on CNN. However, as soon as I started reading this book it was obvious that the author Singular delves to far into self indulgence time and time again.At times it seems he is simply writing just for the sake of writing, often times describing the weather and a truly ridiculous paragraph about a certain crop that was imported into the Wichita area. And there is also a strong christian viewpoint the author is writing from, which grows rather tiresome.For anyone that is interested in true crime books, pass on this one, or at least wait until it comes out in paperback (I wasted over $20.00 dollars on this book)."
3,VERY disappointing,"This book rehashes a lot of what was in the press, and offers very little insight into this notorious case. The author seems to have had access only to a kooky local psychologist and to Rader's pastor, so don't look for detail about the police or their investigation. The emphasis on the minister is so extensive that the story almost becomes his - a struggle by the educated, liberal Christian to comprehend evil.There's some sensitive writing on this topic, and about the time and place that produced Dennis Rader, but I doubt many true crime readers will find this satisfying. This odd emphasis, along with some clunky writing and weird vocabulary (""fiercesome""?) keep this from being a necessary read.I'm hoping for something better on this case."
2,Not much to it,"I was hoping for something that would delve into the mind of a serial killer. This, however, is kind of a generic re-hash of the chronology of the killings. I found myself flipping through many of the chapters. Also, there's way too much emphasis on the church pastor. He wasn't involved in any way so who cares?If you're interested in true crime, save your money for a better book--there are many."
2,Demonic possission vs. Sociopath,"This version is very disappointing. It seems to focus more on the people within Rader's Luthern Church than on his evil pathology. When Rader's Pastor determined that the only reason for Rader's behaviors was demonic possession, I lost it. This book seemed to offer more proselytizing and Bible thumping than true crime. What a waste."
1,This could have been titled BTS,"BTS a book that stinks! I am a true crime fan and this book is without doubt the absolutely worse book of true crime that I have ever read!I skipped the entire middle of the book and just read the last few pages.""Pastor Clown"" is a main character..and that tell you how stupid this book actually is!It should not even get one star!"
1,Should be Science Fiction - save your money,"Stephen Singular has had no personal contact with the subject person of his book. He has admitted this when confronted at book signings. He speaks with no authority whatsoever and merely repeats whatever tidbits of gossip he can pick up.Here's another fact: Stehen Singular completely blames Pastor Clark for his belief in demon possession. However, Singular is the one who approached Pastor Clark with the idea in the first place and purported to be an expert on demon possession. Also, the first letter that Singular wrote to Dennis Rader purports the same thing - and he used his so-called ""experience"" in demon possession to get interviews. Rader isn't the smartest crayon in the box, but at least he was smart enough not to fall for Singular's line.Singular writes well, but he has no integrity. Save your money and wait for the real truth to come out."
1,Shameless attempt to capitalize on BTK!,"As compared with all of the BTK killer books, this is the worst by far. A totally shameless attempt to capitalize on the terrible decades of fear lived by the citizens of Wichita, Kansas.The book is a rehash of material that has been spun ad-nauseum through a number of similar accounts. The problem here, however, is that much of the information which the author seems to take as given is simply not based on fact. He seems to surround much of his story with surmise.The Booklist reviews it as ""riveting....macabre.....scary"". This reviewer would have to say, ""not reviting .... not all that macabre .... and definitely not scary"", rather ""same-same-same, wrong-wrong and mostly boring-boring-boring"".A total hack attempt at documentary journalism. The author, Stephen Singular, is capable of much better than this.Thumbs down ... save your money ... don't waste your time. There are loads of better books on BTK than this.Densel MyersYukon, Oklahoma"
3,UNHOLY MESSENGER,"To me the interviews with Clark and the investigators were the only interesting parts of this book. When describing the actual crimes, the author seemed to be in a fantasy land, missing key parts and being just downright wrong in others. Amazing that all the relevant details are on the net and the author couldn't even get them right, much less come up with new unpublished data. Still, this book was from an angle that was different, to me anyway, and I rcommend it."
5,An amazing film on a political artist.,"A very compelling film! I had seen Conal's work for years and didn't really know the story behind it. The filmmakers really do a good job of presenting a lot of different perspectives surrounding his work. The interview with L.A.P.D. Chief Daryl Gates is fascinating. An amazing mix of art, politics and humor. A very well done documentary on a modern day urban legend!"
2,Not helpful,After you take the time to enter in all of your information you will wish that you didn't bother! The invitation list is not forgiving to change and the information can not be sorted to show up to best suit what you need. I do not recomend this software to anyone. . .unless you want your headache even bigger!
4,Mike Oldfield meets King Crimson and played by virtuoso musicians,"This band is from Moscow, Russia, and all of the band's members are classically trained graduates from Moscow State Conservatory.They play sophisticated music that sometimes sound like ""classic"" King Crimson circa Red, sometimes like Roxy Music, sometimes like.... Mike Oldfiled?Four tracks with vocals (in Russian, though, but with ranslation in English)) give listeners some relief between more sophisticated and sometimes dark tracks. They are very good and melodic.The musical palette of the band is quite rich: in addition to traditional rock instruments they play violin and fluite.Highly recommended to fans of King Crimson, Universe Zero, Mike Oldfield and anybody who loves well produced non-commercial and challenging music!"
5,Exceptional Review of Design Management,"This is a very thorough treatment of a new and growing topic, design management. Brigitte has effectively jumped the gun here, coming up with one of the first significant books in this area. There are often splits between the design and marketing functions in a company, yet she shows, in careful, methodical detail, how they best work together to come up with successful new designs."
2,Not Design Management,"This book repeats itself in almost every chapter. It's three sections are chopped up by quotes that make sinking into each topic almost impossible. A book labeled Design Management, I would think, would be designed better for an enjoyable experience. Good for reference, not for reading."
4,A must have for Vonnegut fans!,"Any and all Vonnegut is worth buying and reading. This collection of short stories from early in Vonnegut's career is no different. But, buyer beware--if you are looking for Vonnegut stories you've not read before, you will be disappointed! All of these stories were included in Welcome to the Monkeyhouse and Bagombo Snuff Box. If, like me, you've gotta have it all...DON'T PASS THIS ONE UP! A very hard to find collector's item."
2,Misleading Desciption & Photographs,"The Amazon webpage for this book shows two photos for the product, one that's a black rectangle, and one of a book cover. I ordered this book, and the cover is very bland, just blue with the title and author. I have no idea why they show a photograph of this beautiful cover art on this page. Also, despite the book being described as ""Like New"" and covered in shrink wrap, my copy arrived with greasy smudges all over the cover."
1,this book is trash,this is an illegal bootleg with no collectors value.all of these stories can be found in welcome to the monkeyhouse and bagombo snuffbox. it's a waste of money and a sham to purchase this book.
5,The best book I ever bought,"Hawaii Five-0 was my favorite show of all times. I have 7 seasons on DVD with the 8th coming in a couple weeks. This marvelous book is a must for all Hawaii Five-0 lovers. It gives a summary of every single episode including the guest stars & the date it aired and the back of the book is a wonderful restropect of the series. I'll tell you, I couldn't be happier even if the print was in gold. If you love this series as much as I do, you couldn't be happier owning this special book. Thank you Karen Rhodes for this gem."
2,A mediocre book,"I've had the hardcover for quite awhile. It reads like a self-published fan book, which it probably is. It lacks real insight into what made the show special. The episode reviews are amateurish. Lots of ""fan"" comments and observations sprinkled throughout. Very little substance about the history and making of the show. Not recommended. If you want an ep. guide, get one online."
1,What a way to remember a TAINTED title,"Wow, what do you know? someone actually wrote about an undeserved title."
3,Greatest hits,"This is your typical greatest hits album. It didn't show me anything wonderful or new, but it has a bunch of 7"" edits, which are great for mix cds. I like ""Evergrowing..."" much more when it is a straight ambient track, like it is on the album, but the mix is cool too. ""Mickey Mars"" is cool too, and the ""Towers of Dub"" mix is great. The second disc is a collection of remixes and rare mixes and stuff, great but not a must have.A Three star album because I think it would be better to go buy all their studio albums instead of just this."
4,Discovering the Orb,"I had heard of the Orb before, basically from the ""Hackers"" second soundtrack, and I finally got the guts to pick up an Orb CD. Fortunately, I picked this one, for it is the perfect introductory album. I listen to a lot of techno, and it was great to once again find a quality group. Although the first few tracks seem very dancy (and they are), they are still very well done. Blue room is absolutely gorgeous. A few tracks later, toxygen and asylum provide more wonderful songs. And of course, mickey mars and towers of dub provide a different aspect of the Orb's skill. I now own Orblivion and Cydonia, both great albums (orblivion being one of the greatest techno albums ever). This is a good CD for anyone interested in the Orb or techo, or someone trying to discover new aspects of music. I give it a solid 90 percent."
4,Great Work.,Its a great piece of work. Very nice to listen to in the background. Well thought out pieces.The only downside was a few of the tracks tend to be too repetetive like the fluffy clouds track.
3,This product isn't strong enough for sports. When ...,"This product isn't strong enough for sports. When I sweat, it evaporates. Wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who is active in sports or strenuous activity."
1,Too strong.,"First of all I'm not sure they even shipped the right product. I received sticks with completely different designs on the front, and it says ""Original High Endurance"", with no mention of ""classic.""Anyway, the scent isn't bad, its just extremely strong.. you shouldn't be able to smell a deodorant from across the room, yet with this you can. With all the good reviews I've seen I expected this to be fairly good and ordered 6 sticks to save on shipping. Instead I wasted $28 on something I'll never use. Maybe I can give them as gifts to people I don't really care about?"
5,THIS is the toy my 9-year old grandson played with first on the morning after Christmas,He's a boy. He's 9. He's car crazy. He LOVES Lego. He had this on his wishlist -- so we bought it.My daughter reported that THIS was what he chose to play with first thing the morning after Christmas. He played with it all day.What could be a better recommendation than that? Nothing.Another Lego winner.
1,Serial Psychos,I wish i hadn't wasted my money. The acting was terrible and the story line was extremely corny.
1,Better off watching paint dry....,"Three days ago I received a box full of really stupid movies entitled ""Serial Psychos"". I watched each movie as best I could. I admit there was some fast forwarding involved. I then carefully put each DVD back in the box and walked over to the garbage can and placed the box into the garbage can along with the chinese food that I couldn't finish last night. I had asked for no MSG but because of the language barrier the food was not to my specifications and wound up in the garbage just underneath ""Serial Psychos""."
5,Original Flickering Torch,"After a brief absence, Leslie McFarlane returns for his second stint with ""The Hardy Boys"". He begins with a bang. The brothers are asked to investigate strange happenings at an Experimental Farm in Bayport. The majority of this book takes place at night and in part in underground tunnels. Unknown figures roaming about the farm hidden beneath black cloaks add an element of suspense. This book has a spooky feel and one that draws the reader from page to page. This book ranks among the series elite. RATED AREVISION: The 1971 totally altered revision of this book with a completely new story was excellent, packed with pure suspense and a tough case to crack about two murders. Even the revision of this book ranks among my favorites and one of the best revisions in the series."
4,"we love this, but don't lose the kittens!","We love this toy. love it. the kittens are cute, the cat is squishy. It's a wonderful toy. my only complaint is about the Manhattan toy company that makes Nursing Nina. We've lost a kitten and I've written to them several times asking if there is anyway to purchase more kittens. It would be nice if they would email me back at all. Even if the answer is no, I would like an email back saying so."
5,kids in class love it,"bought this for a church class when we talk about God making the kittens and thanking Him for our eyes to see, ears to hear and hands to touch the soft kittens. My class seems to really enjoy the toy"
3,Whiskers fell out,"While this Mama cat and kittens are adorable, half of the Mama's whiskers had fallen out before I even opened the box. I tried to tie them back in, but the string doesn't stay tied. So we just took them all out. Other than that, my daughter loves her cats!"
5,My 3 year old daughters favorite Christmas gift!,"My daughter has not let go of the three little kittens since Christmas Eve. She takes them everywhere we go. I highly recommend this toy. It goes awesome with the book, Mama's Milk!"
2,mountain blood,i found this novel too full of adjectives and too narrow in character development other than the main character. i also never gained an empathy for him. the maple sugar event was too late in the season and other inaccurate descriptions annoyed me.
5,Great Game,"Okay, I am a HUGE fan of the Lego product line and I am a computer nerd. When this game came out so many years ago, I scooped it up immediately and I loved it. Building and animating your creations is very very fun.BUT...regardless of what the product description says, I have not had this game work since I migrated off of Windows 95. Patches and such that promise that this game will work under XP or Vista just don't live up to the hype.If you want to build with Lego bricks on the computer, wait for the new on-line game coming out soon. The Lego company has some surprises to offer...."
5,Jet Ski battery,This battery fits perfectly in my 1999 SeaDoo GTX Limited and spins the starter like my older battery could not. Seems to maintain its full charge with no problems. Costs double the standard battery so I'll need 2 or 3 years of satisfactory service for it to be a good deal.
4,Lots of Fun!,"Overall, I like this set a lot. My granddaughter LOVES it! Things I like about it are: bright ""tropical"" colors, the fact that it plays music and lights up, molded in place settings on the table, cloth curtains, cabana top, and banner, barbeque grill with the string attached spatula, wheels, and the opening grill top, and the fact that the 2 chairs swivel.Things I didn't like about it: only 2 chairs, but there are 4 place settings at the table, the bench seat doesn't open, and it doesn't play enough of any one song (only about 10 seconds or so). I have the Grand Piano made for the townhouse and that one plays nice long songs(long for dollhouse sets). These are why I only gave it 4 stars overall.That said and done, my granddaughter doesn't seem to mind. These are my complaints, not hers. She continues to play with this set long after receiving it. That's what I call a great buy. Way to go Fisher Price!"
1,LITTLE KIDS JEWELRY,When I opened the package this was packed in a dollar store little kids princess package!This is dime store garbage!!WHAT a RIPOFF!!
1,Amazon Rhinestone Bracelet,What a piece of crap. The majority of rhinestones fell off the first time my wife wore the bracelet. Would not recommend it. It is cheap.
4,Mixed emotions,"I admit it, when it comes to tango, I tend to be a purist. Therefore, I still have a hard time accepting many of the latest ""fusion"" trends such as certain songs found in this CD which are not real tangos [e.g. ""Ojos negros"" a traditional Russian song, played in a tango tune] as well as the ""bilingual"" versions of some traditional tangos (sung with a pathetic accent, reminiscent of the early days of Julio Iglesias, I might add!)] The orchestra however, sounds wonderful, exceptionally balanced and very assertive."
2,Too basic,"Maybe a nice book for people who never heard of the phenomenon Internet.However, for people who want to use it in a real business situation might become somewhat disappointed. There is no strategic implication to be found anywhere in the book and it talks about the subjects in a superficial way. For a more practical book (though it can never be practical enough for me) Dave Chaffey's Internet Marketing book is my best second bet."
5,Excellent guide,"This landmark book introduced the idea that having children ought to be something we think deeply about. It guided me many years ago in making that most fateful decision not to have children. It was Whelan who offered this simple, but invaluable bit of advice: Remember that whichever decision you make--to have children or not--you must always expect moments in the future when you will wonder if you made the right decision. This book should be required reading of anyone of child-bearing age. Child bearing and child rearing should be a matter of choice, not of obligation. Whelan argues and illustrates this idea well."
4,HAVING CHILDREN: PROS AND CONS,"Elizabeth M. WhelanA Baby?...Maybe:A Guide to Making the Most Fateful Decision of Your Life(New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1975) 237 pagesAn honest and intelligent examination of the pros and consof deciding whether or not to have children,including personal comments from interviewswith both parents and non-parents.Well-balanced.If you would like to know about other such books,search the Internet for this bibliography:""Books Exploring the Decision to Have Children""."
5,I bought this book 32 year ago...still a beloved reference in my house.,"I bought this book when I was in college in 1975. Reading this book was literally the first time I ever saw in print that adults could chose to not have children. The book is balanced and fair. It gave me the strength to make decisions about my family which affect my every day life, over 30 years later. I made my future husband read it and it impacted him as much as it did me.3 or 4 years ago I found Dr.Whelan and told her this how much this book meant to me. She responded with a delightful letter. The book is a real gem and if you are fence-sitting the child issue, find a copy and read it!"
3,This is perhaps Kiri's finest cd,"What a pleasure it is to hear Kiri sing these EVERGREENS. This could possibly be her finest cd. On this particular cd Kiri really belts out the songs. This is unusual for her, because her style is more laid back than what's performed here. On this cd I think she would be considered a very polished crooner(possibly a supped up Barbra Striesand)I thought Peter Matz did a great job with his arrangements. The orchestra sounded right on target for most songs. The main concern I had for this cd was the song selection. I thought Kiri could have added a few more big gems from C.P.'s repertoire.All I can say is buy this cd. It will please!"
1,Thanks but no thanks,"Kiri should never attempt to sing popular American music, she doesn't have the voice, talent, or swing to do so. Sorry kiri, thanks, but NO thanks..."
3,Where's the Beef?,"Does your child's notebook explode upon opening? Does your child do homework every night after supper and yet bring home dozens of missing assignment reports from school? Does your child come home with the book but no idea what the assignment is? Or perhaps with the assignment and not the book? Does your child frequently have no idea what the words of an assignment actually mean? Does your child weep over the tedium of homework assignments whose worth they cannot comprehend? Does your child go off to school in the morning moderately happy but come home looking beaten down by life? Are you looking for help for such a child? If so, don't look for the answers in this book. There is not a whisper of how to help the organizationally-impaired student. (P.S., If anybody knows of such a book, or can write such a book, please let the world know.)"
3,"Too small to choke on, too large to fit in my wallet","I was a tad disappointed by the tacked-on, hackish ending to this book, but I have to admit that the preceeding five pages really got my pulse racing. Such action! Such adventure! Not to mention the baby-soft feel of the cover. Predictable ending, but overall a fine story.I'm hoping Ben Affleck will be tapped to play the lead in any up-coming movie version."
4,A worthy addition to your fitness collection,"This DVD will get you sweating in a hurry. I really like the interval training in the Fat Eliminator segment. Alternating strength and cardio segments does make the workout go by quickly, which is a plus for this reluctant exerciser! Minna is excellent at cueing and I like her demeanor. The only thing I really don't like about it (and why it is not a 5-star video for me) is all of the jumping. It is definitely NOT low-impact. If you have knee problems, find another video!"
5,A nice change of pace. Effective workouts!,"As someone who's done a gazillion video workouts since the mid 1980's, I can attest to the value of this DVD. It combines what is normally sold separately on regular VHS: Fat Eliminator and Strength and Grace. Fat Eliminator is a cardio circuit style workout with a bonus 15 minute toning with weights segment. Strength and Grace is a refreshing yoga-meets-pilates style of strength and toning workout (no weights). I bought this DVD without knowing anything about Minna's style as an instructor. I am definitely pleased -- she is confident and motivating, without being cheerleaderish, annoying or intimidating. This DVD has quickly become one of my favorites. (I also highly recommend ""Your Personal Best Workout"" with Elle Macpherson + Karen Voight). Stick with it and stay strong, healthy + happy!"
5,"Great, Great, Great","I thought at first this is a terrible workout. But, then I wanted to give it one more chance and then I noticed I was not putting forth the effort like I should have been. I worked out for approximately 1-1/2 months and lost 8 inches in my waist line and hips and lost 20lbs. Of course, this was on a meal plan as well. Like Minna says ""do this program on a regular basis and watch your body change"". It's the truth!!!!!As far as the grace & strength- Excellent for strengthening the joints and ligaments within your body and allowing your body to relax. I have horrible knees and this program really digs deep."
4,Very good for exercise rotation,"These workouts are a part of my 14-day exercise rotation. I realy enjoy the 15 minute blaster workout she puts at the end of the first workout. The only reason why I gave the dvd four stars is because I really didn't feel the strength and grace workout working! However the first workout is a killer! I am at an intermediate/advanced level, and I had to take a breather. Recommended."
4,Minna Optimizer - Balanced Blend,"The way this workout is broken up really helps the time to go by. It works the muscles and gets the heart rate going. It's also a shorter workout for time conscientious exercisers. The only thing I don't like are the pasted on smiles in the background. Also, if you can't handle jumping jacks, you may have skip one circuit."
3,"ok moves, but please show less",Minna does a relatively good workout but I was quite taken back by her attire. Some shots it seems I can almost see her navel. I just dont want to see that much of anyone but my husband. I'm a bit embarrassed for her.
4,Minna is a great fitness personality,"Minna is a great person to watch while exercising. she isn't fake or too peppy and annoying. I find her easy to watch and follow along with. I bought this DVD to get back into shape after having a baby. I must confess that I'm surprised to say that I like the Strength and Grace portion better than the Fat Eliminator. I find the Fat Eliminator a bit boring. The music is not that inspiring and I think there is too much use of plio jumps, etc. which are bad on people's knees. it definitely got my heart rate up tho - I will give it that. The Strength and Grace portion I tried on a whim since I didn't care for the Fat Eliminator and I LOVE IT. The time flies while doing this workout and it's refreshing and relaxing, yet you do feel as if you're getting a great workout. Kudos to Minna for this innovative workout!"
2,Does a Good Slow Cooker Cookbook Actually Exist?,"I purchased The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes in hopes that my question above would be answered in the affirmative. Unfortunately, my quest for good Crock Pot recipes is still very much on. The photos in the book are lovely and appetizing, and I hoped that the quality of recipes would match the quality of the book's presentation.I tried two recipes from Finlayson's book, and one was mediocre, while the other was downright awful. Her recipe for Beef Stew with Stout sounded mouth-wateringly good, but was vastly inferior to my regular stew recipe; watery with very little flavor. The Jambalaya recipe was a disaster. Rice was mushy, and the meat was rubbery and underseasoned. I know it may be unfair to judge a whole book based on two recipes, but I'm honestly scared to try again. It's such a waste (of time, money, effort, etc.) to throw out uneaten food, but that's what ended up happening. My husband and I simply could not stomach the results."
2,Not What I was Looking For,"I had been given a slow cooker a while ago, but could never find good recipes for it. When I thumbed through this book, the pictures and ingredients looked wonderful, so I bought it. What a mistake! These recipes could be made much faster and with the same amount of effort if I didn't even use my slow cooker! If I have to cook everything before I put it in the slow cooker, what exactly is the point? I could cook it using my stove and oven in less time with the same results and effort (something I have successfully tried twice). While the recipes are fairly good in general, this was not at all what I was looking for and to me, it has defeated the purpose of using the slow cooker."
2,not my favorite slow cooker cookbook,I was looking forward to getting this cookbook since I love using my slowcooker but I was very disappointed when I saw that almost all the recipes had me browning the ingredients before putting them in the cooker! Who wants to use two pots???
4,A Great Variety of Recipes,"I really like this cookbook. While I like the ""typical"" American fare, I like to try things that are new, too.Like other reviewers have mentioned, this is not a dump and go slow cooker cookbook. You'll have to spend about 30 minutes or so (depending on the recipe) of prep time before you put everything in the slow cooker, but I actually like that. I think it develops better flavors in these dishes than if you were to just dump everything in and turn the slow cooker on.So far, I've made 6 or 7 of the recipes and have really liked all of them. I try to do a slow cooker dinner every week because of our schedules, so this has been a nice change of pace to the typical short ribs, pulled pork or roasts."
5,About this CD,"** First of all -- THE ITEMS UNDER ""TRACK LISTINGS"" ARE INCORRECT, LOOK AT THE ""ON THIS CD"" area of this listing to discover what selections are on this (2 or 3 CD) Boxed set.The recordingsa are from 1927-1941. I haven't yet listened to this recording, but will comment after listening."
2,No daily transits,"If you are looking for an ephemeris for daily transits, you will not find it here. The daily scope on the disc that I have doesn't properly match day and date, for instance, Tuesday September 4, 2000 (actual date was Monday, September 4, 2000)."
1,Disappointed Hobbyist,"I like to give perfunctory astrology charts to the newborns and their families in my life in a little bound booklet with a chart and some text showing an interpretation of the natal chart. This program cannot produce a wheel! What a waste. Furthermore, it also does not perform compatibility charts, which are fun, even if they are wrong. . . . ."
2,I can tell you where to get good software,For really awesome software get in touch with microcycles....Solarfire is a very good program...do not waste your time on cheap software....microcycles will talk to you about what your software needs are...get programs that you can build upon and grow with....I am an astrologer....I have gone the path of cheap programs only to be disappointed....microcycles has great support and prices.........
3,astrology for entertainment,"For a fun and entertaining look at astrology,I found this CD ROM adequate. It contains information on celebrities including, Harrison Ford, Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, Al Gore, and Albert Einstein, just to name a few. I enjoyed comparing their charts and was not surprised to find out Madonna is a Leo.I must agree with a previous review. There was inaccurate information in my chart and the evening birth times often come up as AM. A book of instructions and perhaps a beginner's manual would be very helpful for anyone with a more than an entertainment interest in charting the stars."
1,need to know,"this cd would not work on my apple computer, I didn't know that until I had my son tray to install it for me. I'm not very good on the computer and didn't contact the seller afterwards."
5,A fun game,"This game is fun because its not like normal games.You have to survive without your parents.The game is a lot of fun.You have to find food,shelter and water in order to play farther in the game. The graphics in this game are wonderful."
1,Is this supposed to be fun?,"If you are looking for a fun game to play with your kids, keep looking. My 8 year old and I could not navigate through the game even after reading the instructions several times. The play is not in 3D animation.We're not quitters, so we read the same ""book"" in the story and wandered around the ship trying to pick up objects, but there is no place to keep an inventory and no way to ""grab"" the objects.This game is not like Harry Potter or even Nancy Drew, where you can go different places or follow a path. Its based on a 2D drawing that doesn't ""do"" anything! It is frustrating, useless and not entertaining. Save your money, even if it's only $!"
2,A disappointment,"I bought this game for my 10 year old, and both she and I were really disappointed by it. Basically, it is a journal of Robinson Crusoe's life on the island, with some oppoutruinities to ""try out"" some of his tasks as you read along. It is not a game, really, in that you are not required to accomplish anything before moving on...all you can do is add color to pictures in the journal if you have successfully accomplished something described therein. Since it is never really clear just what you can try to do, and where you have to go on the island map to do it, it is very confusing.I don't think we ever bothered to try out everything. It was too dull."
3,Sigh. Just. Not. Original. Jarre.,"A quick sidebar here: Does anyone else notice the striking similarity between Jarre's ""Near Djaina"" and Brian Eno's ""Among Fields of Crystal"" from his ""Ambient 2"" album? Not only do both possess the same basic harmonic progressions and mood, but both are also using precisely the same shimmering piano effect. Hmmmmmm!Overall this is quite listenable, but it's the kind of stuff that Supreme Beings of Leisure or William Orbit would do better. It's a bit ham-handed, as is most of his stuff from the last 15 years or so.But where did Jarre go?? His ""Equinoxe"" is still unquestionably the pinnacle of the style, but I fear that he has strayed far, far, far off course. Like Klaus Schulze, he was on fire when he began, but he has produced little of any consequence since."
3,the sound is Jarre but the music not...,"If you expect the good old space music from Oxygene or even the more comercial Equinoxe or Magnetic Filds forget about it.It looks like Jean Michel Jarre is making experiments in new directions and trying to win new fans,but he is loosing the old ones.Although you can recognize the rich digital sound which is so specific to Jarre, this music is different.I give it only *** because I am a fan of his old style music.Were I a lounge music fan,I would have given it a ****."
1,I'd rather listen to cats screw.,"Run, don't walk from this compilation of pure schlock. Digital is dead (as if it were ever alive) and it's corpse haunts us to this day. Mindless, senseless and most certainly, artless is how to describe this meaningless mix of regrettable notes. Jarre has done it again. I just wish he would stop."
1,What's This?,"I'm really bummed with all the complaining about JMJ's recent releases. I'm tempted to add this CD to my collection, but I think we should all get on Sony/Dreyfus' case and ask them why they never released the ""12 Dreams of the Sun"" from the live concert at the Pyramids in Egypt in 2000. I am lucky enough to own a bootleg copy of only 9 dreams from eBay and the book about the show from Amazon U.K. I also think its about time that the Houston concert (long out of print) and the Paris and Barcelona live shows should also be available in the U.S. Instead we have to put up with this stuff which I usually pick up as promos in my local used CD venue since no one seems interested in it."
5,Life Among Whales is extraordinary story!,This DVD gives you a personal insight into the complex and beautiful quest to understand the life and society of whales. Amazing images and enticing story of Roger Payne's dedicated search for insights and as a voice for the protection of this remarkable species.
4,Better than the picture,"I hesitated to purchase this hook based on the picture, as the finish looks much lighter than the oil rubbed bronze fixtures already installed in our bath, but I took a chance. I'm glad I did - the finish is actually a richer color than that pictured and the hook is quite hefty. It's described as a robe hook, but we use it as a towel hook just outside our shower door on a spot on the wall where a towel bar or ring wouldn't fit. It looks beautiful and takes up little space in the process."
2,Sturdy but boring,"These came, as described, in a net bag with six, multi-colored tennis-ball-like balls, in various fun colors. They feel sturdy and ought to take the dog a while to work through them. There is, however, absolutely NO bounce (as in ""zero, zip, nada"") to these. The dog and I prefer the less-expensive Penn ""coach"" tennis balls purchased locally. They bounce WAY better and provide a challenge for her and laughter for me."
1,Not a 600 lb capacity cot!,"I purchased three of these cots several months before going camping, thinking they would be extra strong as they indicated a 600lb capacity. After sleeping on them one night, all the cots ripped were they'd been sewn together. Biggest person using them was 250lbs. Luckily no one fell through the cots. I called the company telling them the cots seemed defective since they'd ripped along the seems that had been sewn. They said they'd replace them if I paid shipping to return the defective cots, and pay shipping for the replacement cots. Wasn't worth the money. Item didn't meet advertised quality."
2,ripped the side,i weigh 325 lbs and sleep on cot for two weeks before it ripped on the side and a rivot fell out. if your 250 or less it might work for you.
1,Bad Idea,Cot broke in the middle of the night. Not heavy duty like was stated. Do not recommend for anyone who does a lot of camping.
5,Cot,Had other cots fail due to cheap construction. This one made of high quality and very sturdy and strong. Easy to setup and is comfortable. Well worth the money.
1,Are you kidding me!!,"I think this song is whack. His voice is so annoying, like he's singing out of his nose. Can't stand the song. For me, this just isn't doing it! I gave it one star because the webpage wouldn't let me pass through without it!"
5,Best Sonnets in America about African Americans and Women,May we see the 5-star review by Dr. Marilyn Maye?
5,amazing album,yes the album came out in 1994 on the CZ label (Treepeople) and was just reissued because the CZ label doesn't exist anymore. But now it's back and it's It's nothing short of fantastic!
3,"A good find, but FIVE stars?!","This is a nice rock album, challenging and rewarding, although my roommate calls it crap. I just can't see fit to give it a classic rating--there's better stuff out there. Somewhere?"
3,Could be updated,"The book is a great resource for brainstorming potential risks to your projects and strategies to handle them. Almost all are timeless. However, the book is 10 years old and much has changed over the last 10 years. The Internet is a prime example. This new medium has most of the risks of legacy systems, but the Internet brings new possibilities and new expectations."
3,Not their best.,"I have to admit, I'm a big fan, and the only reason this CD is given 3 stars is because it's my least favorite. The songs, while typical of the wit and wordplay of past CDs, seems a little laboured, and the succinctness of previous albums gives way to long-winded songs that don't change enough to keep my interest long enough. Darnielle's songs are best and most powerful when they're short and still - I daresay - powerful.That having been said, this album contains what is easily my favorite MG song, ""Best Ever Death Metal Band..."". So go figure.If you're already a fan, you're going to buy this album no matter what I say - and it's a good collection piece. If you're not a fan, pick up ""Full Force Galesburg"" or, if you don't want to spend that much on something that is an acquired taste, do what I did and pick up ""Beautiful Rat Sunset"" and see if you like them."
1,Disappointed,I was soooo... disappointed in this soundtrack. The soundtrack songs sounded completely different than the movie songs.
2,Music not as listed on Track Listing,"I was disappointed in the CD, as all the music was not what was listed on the track list in the description. In fact, most of the songs were not on the cd."
5,Very fast shipping!,The item I purchased was shipped immediately and the item purchased was received in perfect condition! I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
3,mildly disappointing,"Sometimes cross-over works, sometimes not. While Kiri te Kanawa has a beautiful voice, she never gets into the idiom of these Jerome Kern masterpieces sufficiently to convey their stories or their subtleties. Smoke Gets in Your Eyes especially stands out, she sings it with none of the pathos the song demands and her version pales compared to the Platters. The orchestral arrangements are decent and in many of the songs the purity of her voice is enough to carry them, but overall I would say this is a disappointing example of a crossover record. Ms. te Kanawa should stick to what she does best."
3,Lacks Splendor,"Though I do enjoy Kiri's interpretation of most music, and this CD was decent, I did not find any piece particularly memorable.The voice is undeniably beautiful, and Kiri has managed to keep her maturing voice sounding somewhat young, yet I find that I much prefer her rendition of ""The Laughing Song"" to that of ""Smoke Gets in YOur Eyes.""If you love Kern, and couldn't care less who performs it, than purchase this CD. If you are a fan of Kiris', then perhaps it would be best to avoid this purchase...for it is not a shining star in her vast collection of CDs. All in all, it was a disappointment."
3,"Good songs, glossy sound, mediocre value","I like the songs on this disc. In my opinion, Kern was a more fecund tune writer than Cole Porter with a greater gift for indelible melody. These songs are beautiful and nostalgic. But it's hard to ignore the skimpy playing time (45 minutes), more characteristic of a jazz or pop album, as is the recording of Kiri's voice. Kiri's mouth seems to be right on the microphone and is heavily amplified. This almost forces her into a suave croon which grows tiresome. I would have preferred a more natural, acoustical reproduction of the voice."
3,good but not as good as the first cd,"if your reading this you are probably from houston, cause that is were they play like 90% thier shows, although this cd is good the first next to nothing cd is 2 times better so look for that one, its called soft spokin."
4,From Sea to Shining Sea,"This book is a treasury of poems, songs, and stories, from the great country of the US :) The songs are traditional, and, if you have a little skill in piano, flute, recorder, or mallet percussion, you can play them with ease.The poems are okay, and they include Paul Revere's Ride, which is wonderful.The stories are also interesting, and they probably aren't ones that you've ever heard before; all of them are 'G' rated, except for one that might be a little scary for little kids in the first section about a girl whose fingers were smashed off by her father and brothers (gross).This book is okay, but it isn't the greatest thing out there."
4,A great resource for teachers and others.,"I've used this book in my work as a substitute teacher in elementary school and as a Scout leader. It reflects thediversity of American culture - good Native American tales, for example. The continuity of the illustrations - each illustrator does one section - is a nice touch."
3,Ok,"I love CS Lewis, but, for whatever reason, I couldn't get into this book. It was well-written and whatnot, I guess I was never into the whole fantasy world thing."
3,Worth a look,"""Hallows Eve"" is Al Sarrantonio's second novel in the Orangefield series (although I don't know why Leisure decided to release the second book first). The story starts off stronger than the predictable finish, but I found it solid nonetheless. As a writer, Sarrantonio has flavors reminiscent of T.M. Wright and Tom Piccirilli. The book is a very quick read, but I wanted Sarrantonio to push the envelope a little more."
2,Nothing new to the halloween tradition,"All Hallow's Eve isn't anything new -- it's a twist on an old theme, concentrating too much on the practices of Halloween (which has been beaten to death already), while showing all it's cards up front. The villians are introduced way too fast, there's not enough mystery remaining, the characters aren't really latched on to, and the ending wasn't anything overly powerful. Still, All Hallow's Eve isn't too bad...it kept me reading, and that's saying something. If a novel is genuinely bad, I usually won't finish it. I finished this one, because it DID have some saving grace. One being the well written detective, another being morbid curiosity for the show down (although my expectations weren't that high), and another being that while the plot was disorganized and jumbled, it wasn't exactly dull."
1,Out of print and deservedly so.,"After reading some of the reviews but mostly the 1 star reviews I had to jump in. I realize this book is out of print and was published 6 years ago but I still have to put my two cents in.Nobody in their reviews (especially the one star reviews) said anything about how poorly this book is written. Some have even said it was well written. I take issue with that. For example the protagonists are a twenty something year old man and a 7 year old child. So at one point in the story why does Al refer to them as children? At another time a police officer is firing his pistol and it goes from a revolver to an automatic and back again. In fact he reloads his revolver by shoving a loaded magazine into it!?!Ugh, this author is the worst and I have no desire to read anything else by him. I've only hung on to the paperback because I love the cover."
4,Good Product for a Stick Deodorant,"This is the deodorant that I travel with because the stick fits into a toiletry bag easily. The smell of this formula is very good and it does offer all day protection. There are two things I don't like about stick deodorants though. First, it's sticky and a little uncomfortable when you put it on. Secondly, unless you really have the deodorant stick far enough out of the container, you can sometimes scratch your underarm with the sharp plastic edges. Otherwise, I'd give this product a thumbs up."
2,shifting down and bare spots,"I bought the queen size comforter and within one week the down had shifted and there were bare spots. I live in the north and it is cold so this interprets to cold spots.If I could do it over again, I would have gladly paid more and bought higher quality."
1,"THIN THIN THIN, VERY THIN..","I was hoping this would be a good deal as it is just starting to get cold here is the Atlanta Area, First day in the 30s for us..This is like having Two extra sheets with a sprinkling of Down..I was hoping when I seen 10 oz of Down that was per Sq. Ft of some other meause but I am guessing it is total.. I was going to put up My Quilt and use this for the winter but I'll have to save this for the Summer and break out the Comforter..The price looked great but not for two sheets and a few feathers.. I was looking for a Comforter to keep me warn :)Not even close to what I thought it was, These must be for use in Sothern Mexico or some other Hot Spot.."
3,"Cute, but not very fun.","I bought this for my daughter when she was 3 years old. It is cute, but there's not too much to it. It never kept my daughter's interest for very long. She is 5 now. She has asked me to get it out for her every great once in awhile over the past two years. And once she starts to play with it, it keeps her attention for about 5 minutes tops. It did come in a plain cupboard box, so it had no appeal being unwrapped for Christmas, but the box is GREAT for storage. It's not a the kind of box you find in a toy store that is only made for ""shelf appeal"" and gets thrown away as soon as you open it. I love the box for its storage capacity."
5,Christmas Village for Grandsons,"The pieces are bright and colorful, very durableand easy to hold and play with"
4,very cute,"I find this set to be just a little more than my 14 month old can use right now. Although he loves all the pieces, he doesn't understand having the reindeer pull the sleigh and the houses are a little light-weight and the doors a little too small to really be easy for him to use. I think this will be a big hit next Christmas season. Oh, and ours came in the ""hard-to-open"" package (I hate those), not a white box."
5,Quality at a reasonable price,I purchased this playset for my little grandaughter for Christmas. She loves it!I'ts a very durable toy that will last for years.
3,Cute but expensive,"I purchased this as a gift for my niece. She loves the Fisher Price Little People and has almost every set. While this toy is very cute (and of course she loves it), it is not worth the price of $50.00. The ""shops"" are very tiny. I also bought the Little People Christmas on Mainstreet this year. The villages were much bigger and it came with more Little People and accessories. I only paid $19.99 for this! I don't know if the Christmas Village is normally $50.00 or the price was inflated at Christmas time because it was Santa Claus."
2,Caveat Emptor,"I ordered this item with express shipping for a class on Sallust. Little did I know that this edition contains SELECTIONS rather than the complete text. Moreover, there is no commentary, just selections and vocab."
4,"It woulda got a FIVE STAR, but...","...give thanks aint in the original key, LOL! I love the cd and my best friends got the dvd as soon as it came out. I was itchin for Kevin to rip Give Thanks, but they took it down a couple keys, so I kinda felt a lil cheated, but he still killed it tho. But other than that, every song is HOT!!! The band kills every song, and the vocals are always point! This dvd is worth pickin up!"
2,Boogie gets Boring,"This compilation starts out good but loses momentum after the sixth track. It is a record that deserves to be in a dj's collection, but only for the first 5 tracks. Could this be the reason why disco died? It could be. The rest of the tracks are noisy and unenjoyable. Popular bands and singers aee featured in this cd, but it isn't reason enough to actually listen to their songs. The strongest tracks here are ""Boogie nights"" by Heatwave and ""Boogie Oogie oogie"" by Taste of Honey. Most of the songs are unnecessary fillers."
3,DOWN UNDER BLUES,"JINDABYNE is the name of the small town in New South Wales where this dark drama is set. Four friends on a weekend fishing trip discover the body of a murdered young Aborigine girl. Instead of reporting their find immediately, they tether her to a tree, continue their fishing expedition and report the body on Sunday. In addition to upsetting the surrounding Aboriginal population, the townspeople of Jindabyne also express their disgust with the seemingly insensitive behavior of the fishermen. This also causes a rift in the already tenuous marriage of the film's two stars, Laura Linney and Gabriel Byrne.The movie is slow moving and seems longer than its 2 hours+ length, but Linney and Byrne are superlative in their roles as is the supporting cast especially Deborah Furness as Jude. Not for everyone's tastes, but the film does pack an emotional wallop."
4,OK Movie--slightly depressing,"The story is good and it was a strong movie--however, I found it to be too depressing and often felt the need to call the female character a ""PITA i.e pain in the ass.:-):-) I mean she certainly had issues. Sorry for the guy who ends up with a wife like that. However, the way the group kept fishing despite a dead body floating nearby, is just beyond me. Of course, it shows how numb one's existence becomes through ups and downs of life, that smallest opportunity to be happy or to be in peace (like fishing) seems too valuable to be spoiled by a minority dead-body. The movie did bring some underlying social questions of class and racism. By the way, it was scary to know that the main killer remained unpunished.Very good acting from all involved. Recommend, with caution--aftertaste of sadness."
2,"beautiful cinematography, wonderful acting, yet. . .","This movie reminded me in part of an outback version of Short Cuts by Robert Altman (the Chris Penn, Robert Downey Jr vignette) and the movie Limbo with David Strathairn and M.E. Mastroantonio. After all of the effort they must have expended in order to make this film, I have to wonder why they fell so short on the storytelling. Did they run out of cash for the screenwriter or better yet, did they even have one? If the desire was to make the movie beautiful, yet ambiguous--they succeeded, however for me this movie was also an exercise in frustration. The characters were all fascinating to a degree, they were never truly defined, what motivated any of them, what is/was the point of it all? This movie had so much promise, yet just didn't deliver on so many levels. Why start with a roar and then ramble off into subtlety? Why???"
5,Some thoughts on Jindabyne,"If you enjoy the work of Ray Lawrence or Gabriel Byrne then you will enjoy this movie. It's based on the short story by Ray Carver called ""So Much Water So Close to Home."" The story line can seem disjointed at times as there is much that must be assimilated but the acting is wonderfully raw. Ray Lawrence has the reputation of only shooting one take when creating his movies so there is a natural element found. The scenery is fantastic and the moral is relevant."
3,Usual outback story,"Set in a sleepy apathic Australian outback, this story is a next alarm at steady danger psychotic rapists and killers bring about around a continent far remote from the rest of a civilised world(More:Wolf Creek (Unrated Widescreen Edition),The Book of Revelation [Region 8] )Perhaps, locally grown up, depicting dense affairs and interracial relations producers know a topic very well."
1,paint drying,"my wife and I watched this last night and watching paint dry would be much more interesting. Boring, not point, except possibly that those evil white people don't like the close to nature, wonderful and good natives. Typical new Australian politically correct nonsense. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,good and bad,"These headphones are both really good and really bad at the same time. The sound quality is amazing with good bass and everything. The bad part is that they come off really easy. Also, I hope the person next to you likes the same music. The reason I said this is there is a lot of sound leakage. So if your like me and travel on a plane a lot you either keep the sound really low or not buy these."
2,Not very impressive - especially bad for smaller ears,"Bought these based on the glowing reviews here, but I could not keep them on my ears to save my life. If you are a woman, or a teenager with small ears, they will not stay on. I wore them at the gym and my workout partner said she could hear them from the next treadmill. Just not impressed with these. I let my husband try them to run in, but they fell off his ears also when he went on his run."
2,There Are Better Alternatives,"I'm going to make this review as simple and straight-forward as I can.PRO'S: The sound quality is quite good. It's got great bass and sounds pretty crisp.CON'S: Everything else. They will NOT stay on your ears if you so much as sneeze. They leak a LOT of sound so everyone within 5 feet will hear your song well enough to recite the words. It's pretty cheaply made - the chord split open, exposing the wires, at 4 different spots. These were just spots where the chord was bent or wrapped up. How are you going to put these in your bag/purse without slightly bending the wire??Bottom line = Get other headphones, of better quality, for the same price. These are disappointing to say the least."
3,KSC50 is average,"I thought these stereophones were uncomfortable to wear and bought these due to the reviews on this site. Also since they are open air, everyone around you can hear what you're listening to. If you are fine with those two things, these headphones are for you."
2,Won't hold for long,"For the while I had these guys, they did me well, pretty good sound quality. I'll just summarize pro's and cons:Pro--Descent sound quality- relatively [inexpensive]Con--Will fall apart if you're semi active, or will fall apart on its own in a half a year.- Open ear, so if you play your music loud, you're going to get a lot of complaints.- Not the best sound qualityIf you don't have a high budget, then these will do for a while.But if your looking for better sound quality, look at some sennhieser headphones ( px100's)"
3,good headphones,I like these headphones but the only problem that I have is that the wire comes through the cord. Also the ear clip broke on one of the headphones. But everything else is good.
4,"GREAT sound quality, but...","These KSC50s have great sound quality, just like their predecessors, the KSC35 and Portapros (made from same driver), but there is one thing wrong with these: the comfort level. They SOUND great, but they'll hurt your ears after about an hour or so, especially if you have small ones like me. I would recommend the ""outdated"" KSC35 instead, because the spring there is located at the side of the earphone, while this one's is at the top, where it hurts your ear. The only difference between the two is price (KSC35 ~ $30; KSC50 ~ $13 at the time of this writing), comfort level (subjective), and style."
4,G R E A T,"These are really great headphones, and they are very comfortable. Although, do NOT get these if you have a big head, or ears that stick out. THEY WILL NOT WORK. Amazing sound quality, (even better than the sony ones that were 30 bucks)and great bass.If you are having trouble putting them on, here is some advice:a) Pull the clip thing away from the headphone gently, and stick it on your ear, pushing the headphone against/behind your ear, as you do so.Or, if that doesnt work, (Or they wont stay on)b) take the rubber end of the clip and pull it over the other side of the headphone and then pull it back. THEN stick them on your ear. (This works if you want them tighter, like for working out laying down)Buy this pair of headphones if you want some really inexpensive ones that sound amazing"
2,don't waste your money,"These headphones served their purpose, but I'd recommend getting better ones. Here are some reasons I didn't like this product:-Left ear broke as soon as I took it out of the package; still worked, but the part that hooks onto your ear kept twisting/falling off.-Uncomfortable, bulky-Kept falling off-Unable to take music at high volumes for very long (maybe that was my fault...)Besides all that, here are the reasons I bought the product in the first place:-Allowed me to share the music with a friend, or listen to the music with one ear, and hold a conversation with the other.Well, that's about it. I wanted headphones that would have separate ears, and these were the best for their price. If it's really what you want, go ahead and get them."
3,For the price they're OK,"Don't get me wrong, for the price, these are OK headphones. The sound is decent and they are fairly portable. However, there are some drawbacks.1) They hurt your ears a little bit. Maybe I just need to give them more time.2) Since they are open air headphones, other people can hear your music too. If you're going to use them while riding a bus or on a shuttle, then you might make others angry. If you're going running with them, then they should be fine.One of the pluses to these headphones is that they hold very well. So if you like to run, they'll be very good."
4,Music in combat,"I Purchased these headphones before i left for Kuwait then Iraq,i was looking for somthing small portable and disposable in case they got lost or blown up. for being stuffed in a medical bag being bounced around and thrown about i can say its a very durable dependable pair of headphones, I was not expecting much for sound but i was suprised on how well these headphones delivered, before the war, we had tons of down time and listened to music on a cd player, to me they have a good bass response, and clean highs with little distortion.they survived the war beat to hell but still working and sounding as good as the first time I put them on, if you are looking for a dependable good sounding pair of headphones with out spending too much money these headphones might serve you well, they have survived in combat and will survive any domestic abuse."
4,About disappointment,"Hi,I bought the KSC-50 SportClip from Amazon.com after reading several reviews about it and after checking with KOSS.COMI received them in time, so Amazon.com did its job perfectly !But what a surprise when I opened the package (nicely opened, you never now if you may return it or not). The nylon-covered cord what instead a PVC cord !!!I checked with Amazon and KOSS. Now they have both changed the information concerning the product.So overall, they are nice, comfortable but have a fragile PVC cord...too bad, they missed the 5 Stars."
2,Inexpensive But...,"These are very inexpensive headphones and though their sound is clear and crisp and the bass good, I find them a bit too much on the harsh/tinny end of the sound spectrum. It hurts my ears to listen to these, especially with higher notes. Save your money and get something better. Sennheiser MX 500 earbuds or Sennheiser PX 200 would be good choices."
3,Ok while it lasted,"PRO: Good sound quality, stay on your ear most of the timeCON: Foam disintegrated, because of the design those in close proximity are more likely to hear your music."
3,KOSS KSC50,"These headphones have good bass, and very portable very portable, the sound quality is very good for the priceMy headphone clip broke off after a couple of months, the clip can sometimes hurt your ears when you wear them for a whilei would go for different headphones, like the Sennheiser PX 100"
3,"sounds good, doesn't block out noise","I agree with some of the other reviewers that the sound quality is quite decent. It's true that the behind the ear clip takes a little getting used to, but generally holds on okay. The problem is that it doesn't keep out any external noise whatsoever. I bought these because I fly a lot, but I find myself needing to crank up my CD player to block out the jet noise."
1,don't make the mistake I did,"I bought this from amazon.com. Once I received it I installed it on my mac powerbook 3400c running os 9. It ran horribly, the quicktime images overan half of the screen window of the program so it was impossible to use on my mac. Because it also has a windows version of itself on the cd I then installed it on my husband's pc. It ran much better on his pc (which upset me even more since it is supposed to be able to run on a mac), however the screen was still very small, the quicktime images choppy and the viewing area incredibly small. After trying to see if I could tweak it on both the pc and mac I have had dismal success with it. Knowing what I know now I would not have bought it. The software that runs this program from the cd is achingly old as well."
1,Terrible installation,"This product has many problems:1) It doesn't come with a manual, this makes using it and installing it a guessing game.2) This was written for Win 3.1 (16-bit), so it's clunky in Win 95/98/Me (32-bit)3) It requires that you DOWNGRADE your QuickTime to an old 16-bit version. This means you can no longer view QuickTime movies on the web!4) The installer prompts you if you want to install the 16-bit or 32-bit version of QuickTime. Yet according to technical support, only the 16-bit version is compatible with this software. So why does the installer do that?!?"
1,Is it me or the software...,"Might just be me, but I find the software to be ""dead"" on my computer. I can access the dictionary, but the video does not come up at all. Perhaps my system is too new (Windows 98). I really want to learn to sign, but find this product to be tedious (and out of date??)."
1,"Good concept, bad Mac implementation","If you have a Macintosh, don't bother buying this product. I just got version 2.1 running on MacOS 9.0.4, and it is just awful. The engine for the product is a FIVE YEAR old version of Macromedia Director, and has serious problems running on current MacOS and QuickTime software. The video clips get shown in the main window before getting properly positioned in the video frame, which obscures text and buttons. The operation is so slow (even on a fast G4) that it would be effectively unusable even if it worked correctly. I'm returning my copy.Michigan State University's ""Personal Communicator"" works much better, though the video clips are too small to see finger positions. For a great BOOK, try Lou Fant's ""American Sign Language Phrase Book""."
1,Do not purchase this CD if you have a Mac,I have a G4 with ample memory and storage space...This software was slow and trying to make it work was painful. The images would merge with the text. The software was clearly written for WinTel machines. I'll rely on my human instructor for my ASL needs.
5,great,works great to stop these nasty orange bugs and the little black bugs that invade my house every fall thank you norm
5,Works great and great value,"I used both this product and the clear window traps to clear up an infestation in a pet room in about a week. This product is better for clearing the infestation since you get much more surface area for the price. It is as sticky as a tar pit, so I wouldn't place it behind curtains or blinds. The ribbon is unattractive so once the infestation is cleared up, I would go with the clear window traps to get any stragglers."
1,Poor Quality FLY RIBBON,The ribbon would not come out of the package. The string to tie the ribbon up broke.I would not recommend this brand to anyone.
3,fly ribbon,"i wanted some fly ribbons and that is exactly what these are. no frills. they are over priced as you can buy these for 1 dollar at dollar tree, but i needed an ad on item to get super saver shipping on another order otherwise i would not have purchased these at this price."
1,worthless junk,Cheap product when ur pulling the ribbon up to open the entire thing comes off! Most importantly not a single fly on the ones that worked. DO NOT BUY!!!
1,Won't attract anything,I recieved these a week ago. I wasn't overly concerned about how well they worked until they didn't work at all. One week and not one fly or gnat! I have killed several with a fly swatter. Don't waste your money or your time.
1,Leewaey -Adult crash,"I was very happy with poduct,shipping time and buyer responce. I am part of the NYHC family and decided to go agaist my usual to acqire to first press of this ""lost album"" and was more than impressed. I WILL BUT FROM THEM AGAIN."
2,adult crash is an understatement this is a total destruction of used to be leeway!!,"don't by it don't even try it it's horrible for get it exsists and enjoy the 1st 2 cds.this is nothing like anything they have done ,this is a falliung apart band doing this for smack money?"
2,"Nice fragrance, but that was all for me","PROS: good conditioner, excellent fragranceCONS: did not ""repair"" my hair, very expensive (small bottle), had to apply a LOT of it to cover hairI blow dry, flat iron, color my hair. My hair used to be soft as silk. It's still healthy hair, but I wanted to see if this would make the texture more like it was before all of the above. It lasted ~12/13 shampoos. GREAT fragrance, and while I noticed improvement in shine, hair health, and moisture when I used it, when it ran out and I just used the salon products I normally use, my hair looked and felt just like it did before using the L'Oreal product. So it's a great conditioner, but definitely didn't ""repair"" any processing damage to my hair.Won't buy again."
1,Leaves a film on hair,The product leaves a film on my hair. My hair feels weighed down and dirty. I have dry hair so this is highly unusual for me.
2,Absolutely No Repair,"This product used to work on my hair when my hair was in a healthier condition and there wasn't much to ""Repair"". Even since I have gotten highlights this product doesn't do anything for me anymore. It's almost like using nothing, doesn't soften my hair, my hair is tangled and unmanageable, my scalp is really dry and L'Oreal is not ""repairing"" at all. Have also tried L'Oreal's Kerastase, and I think it's just an overpriced myth. I am switching to more natural solutions."
3,Meh,"I've been using this conditioner (along with the shampoo) for about a week now. I bought it because my hair was starting to feel dry and frizzy. The first time I used it, I was surprised at how thin it was, and I felt like I had to add more to my shoulder-length hair. It's definitely better than drugstore brands, but I wouldn't call it a miracle worker."
3,used it,I used this and it didn't do anything to my hair this bottle is overpriced It's tiny and very expensive
5,Great Product!,"My hairdressers had been complaining about my hair feeling thin and dry. I blonde my hair and into the bargain have fine, straight hair and also I am on a lot of medication. After using this product once a week for four weeks, I went back to my hairdressers and they couldn't believe the difference in my hair.My hairdressers did not know that I had been using this product as in their salon they use a different brand of hair products. My hair feels so much more hydrated and thicker. I thoroughly recommend this product."
5,Love this stuff,"I bought this because the last woman that cut my hair recommended it for me. I'm so glad she did because my hair is smoother and healthier than it's ever been. It definitely sucks that it's so expensive, but I have found that a little goes a long way. I have medium length hair that I usually wash every other day. The same hairdresser told me to use a regular drug-store clarifying shampoon (I use neutrogena) and I have found the two work very well together. I alternate between the clarifying shampoo and just a regular store bought moisturizing shampoo. Totally recommend."
5,This is the best tatting pattern book that I have ever seen.,"I teach needle tatting and this book is a great tool for any tatter, with the shuttle or needle. It makes it so much easier, with clear patterns and wonderful pictures. You can't get lost or confused as I did with so many other pattern books. A great asset to any tatters library."
4,NOT A BAD TRANSFER FOR THESE GOLDEN OLDIES! I REALLY LIKE THIS DISC.,YES I LIKED THE MOVIES. IT IS A VERY GOOD TRANSFER JOB FOR THESE OLDIES. AND ONE I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THANKS FOR THE PROMPT DELIVERY TOO.
3,"Better than some, but still suffers from the same issues as all textbooks in the field","This book is a reasonably competent reference on panel data econometric methods. Its somewhat more clear and helpful than most metrics books, but not by a whole lot. It suffers from the same problem that plagues all econometrics texts. Like all metrics textbooks, it's long and overly detailed where it should be concise, and it's terse where it should be detailed. It also lacks a coherent, step by step structure. But that's essentially par for the course.Statistics texts are almost universally either ultra-simple, hand waving outlines with no good mathematical insight, or they're a sprawling, useless mess of asymptotic derivations with no practical explanation, applicable intuition, or computational guidance. I'm hoping that one day, someone will write a really good econometrics textbook. This is a small step in the right direction, but it isn't the one we've all been waiting for."
2,Buy the second edition,"The strengths and weakness of this text is well-covered in the other reviews. I want to point out at least one serious error in the 1st edition of the book: in Chapter 12, page 357 it is claimed that the empirical Hessian may fail to be positive semidefinite. This is simply impossible since positive semidefiniteness is a necessary condition of maximization of a smooth function at an interior point.This error has been corrected in the second edition (see page 414). Spend a few dollars more, buyEconometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, 2nd Edition. You also get lots of new material. (Don't know about new errors though).It is unfortunate that while Wooldridge has corrected this error in the 2nd edition, he does not mention this in the errata file on his website [as of 2011.02.28]. Led to lot of head scratching on my part."
3,"Good, but missing some important topics","With more than 1000 pages, the author does not cover some important topics. Where is partial identification? Where is nonparametric identification? It also misses some estimation methods, motivated from dynamic models, like Hotz-Miller. It is a good textbook to learn some basic econometrics, but hardly a good graduate-level textbook. For econometric and applied researches, Handbook of Econometrics chapters are better references."
5,It is NOT Turkish music but rather Armenian,I just wanted to comment on the remark of the previous reviewer. This is a mix of Armenian and Turkish music. The duduk(Armenian Flute) player is an Armeninan vituoso who also appeared in many soundrtaks like Gladiators and others..
5,Armenian or Turkish?,When i looked at the credits of the album there are 6 Turkish musicians and 4 Armenian musicians. It is a joint compilation if you don't accept that it actually is a majority decision so it is TURKISH. :)It is a dream of an album. I strongly recommend it.
1,Share it with someone you hate.,"....or with someone you love, or even with someone you are totally neutral about.But it is a lot to spend on a book which doesn't cover anything new except for that which is experimental and quite a ways away before reaching your local theatres.I suggest you let the rads you work for buy it for everyone, and you go have a very nice night on the town instead."
2,Disappointing,"Although Lessard and Baldwin are amusing and entertaining writers, at the end of the day, this book is just more of the same regarding the dot.bust pity party. Nobody twisted workers arms to work in these companies. Many were paid far more than they were worth. Now they have to deal with reality. Tough."
3,I liked the first one enough to read 2.0,"Is this great literature? No, but it tells people's stories, and that's what I like. I read books about Apple, Microsoft, and the rest because I like personal antidotes and want inside information. Therefore, I found this book satisfying. It's a collection of ""this could happen to you, so watch your back"" tales. There's also improvement since the first volume because now the authors name names instead of using goofy pseudonyms."
4,Deep!,"Others have critisized this film for adding nothing new to the genre, but the quality and depth of the characters is more than enough to make this a film worth watching."
3,Stake Land was ok,"Acting was good, but there was little back story to the main characters or the reason for the vampire apocalypse. Some may not mind the lack of back story."
2,Stake Land........ Dont bother,"If you like bad acting, makeup, directing, dialog then this one is for you!! This is nothing more then a BAD B movie, don't waste your time or money like I did listening to the other reviews on this page. If you like a horror movie ( vamp ) with some intelligents look at 30 days of night the first installment. I will always tell it like I see it. Scott M."
3,good rental,Good story. Kinda dragged in spots though but it is definetely worth the rental. Thought it would have more action
4,Well done movie,Great character development. Good story line. Had some good scares. Not predictable and worth watching more than once. Would recommend to all vampire movie fans and horror movie fans in general.
4,A meaty feast or stringy gristle?,"Stake Land is not a big budget movie. The special effects suffer if you look too closely, but they are typically shot in such a way that it's not too noticeable. The movie itself is actually quite good. I was surprised to discover that I actually cared about the characters even though we really don't learn a ton about them besides what we see them do.The plot is not ""dudes mow down tons of zombies with big guns"". It's dark and brutal and real. There is one part near the end that is incongruous - more of an action horror film type of event - but not over much is made of it.Stake Land is a step up from many big budget zombie movies. Its director really makes the most of his resources and shows some real skill. The ending is rather open ended, so be warned if you hate those. That aside, I would definitely recommend it."
2,And this is good because????,"I see quite a few positive reviews of this movie and I simply do NOT get it. There was no depth to the characters, nondescript acting and way too much blood and gore. Oh, and the plot was what????????????I love horror and I love vampire movies, but these creatures looked like a cross between zombies and vampires. I like movies with vampires that look like vampires, not ones that look like half-eaten undead. And that touching music along with all that spewing blood and gore simply did not go together.All this movie did that was positive was what it did for the producers, which was set up everything for a sequel. Wish I could get back the time I wasted on this piece of trash....."
2,Thoroughly mediocre,"This movie offers us absolutely nothing new in a dangerously stale genre, and it's really a zombie movie masquerading as (far as I could tell) as a vampire movie, FYI. It's like Zombieland with less memorable performances and absolutely zero comic relief (which is to say, none of the former movie's charm).Unless you're simply downright desperate or like pretty much anything, don't waste the time and money."
1,The worst.,Horrible acting. Horrible plot. Horrible soundtrack. Ridiculous stuff like carving scary mean skulls onto their cool looking vampire stakes. IF YOU LIKE HOT TOPIC YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. I want my $2.99 back.
2,one to avoid,"The idea of the movie might have had some potential and the fx are quite ok but:Did they use a script at all? I really doubt that as I can't find any plot +the acting is so unbelievable poor it makes any soap opera looking Oscar worthy.Luckiely I just rented the movie, but I won't get those 1 hours back..."
3,Not the best but not the worst.,This was not the best vampire movie I have seen but then it was not the worst. Chance of watching it again 40%
4,How did this not go to the big screen?,"Yes, it is yet another vampire flick and what kind of a title is Stakeland? Well, before you pre-judge this film and pass it by, keep my words in mind. This was a Great film. My wife and I were so immersed, we couldn't bear to have it end. It had the feel of an HBO/TMN series. The acting and special effects supported the novel approach this storyline took. If you even remotely enjoyed zombieland, then you will love this film, which is all that and more, without the humor, and with a whole lot of seriousness. If you like horror or vampire or zombie-like films, this must be added to your collection. A parentless boy travels this wasteland with a loner survival expert. The boy is learning the lesson of staying alive in a land infested with the undead and human organizations that are equally dangerous. This film has action, adventure, humor, violence, blood, suspense and even a few heart warming moments."
3,Meh,"I was okay. Someone else said that it's similar to The Road with vampires....very true. The vampires were cool, the acting was good, but the story was not really what I was expecting I guess. It's more storyline like The Road and less Zombieland like I thought it would be."
2,I didn't like it,Slow and repetitive and I got tired of the narration. The characters didn't work for me and the way the movie was directed and edited made it feel cheap and outdated.
4,Rent it already,"I really liked this movie. Its very dark, violent trip through a post-apocalyse America where the survivors can be just as dangerous as the vampires. The whole movie has a gritty realism to it that really grabs onto you and keeps your attention. Rent it, you won't be disappointed."
4,Better than expected,This movie is one of those rare films that starts out a little rough but gets better and better as it progresses. The title definitely does not do the film justice. Very creepy.
1,Big Disappointment,series walking dead got me into the zombie thing. This was poorly done in every way. The visual part drug and the acting was poor.
2,Eh...,"I liked the idea of a slow burn vampire movie. Unfortunately, this burn doesn't lead to anything in the end. It was acted well enough and all, it just wasn't a very good script."
2,Lifeless,"This movie is an awkward mix of bad George A. Romero meets equally bad and pretentious Terrence Malick. I was squirming for the first 30 minutes (not from the gore) and then pressed the ""open"" button on my remote. Fin."
2,What a depressing movie...,"I found this movie absolutely depressing from start to finish. These characters are trying to make it to New Eden, but this movie isn't really all that much about vampires, as it is their treck to get to this New Eden, which they never show, and how they continue to cross paths with this religious fanatic self appointed leader, and his demented zealots. I love how pathetic producers and movies end up writing in the same stereotypical bad guy religious leaders as the main enemy, it's like they can't help themselves, they're almost like the zombie vampires they portray in their movies, unable to quench their own thirst. The only reason I upgraded it to two stars, because they got me to watch it at least once. It wasn't 100% bad, ""some"" decent parts in it. However, not enough. I will never watch this movie again. Even if I was left with only one movie on this planet, I'd burn this one, and create my own."
3,"A serious version of ""Zombieland"". More of a horror then comedy. Not a bad movie, little slow in parts. I say C","""We die, or worse yet, we die and comeback."" After the collapse of the US economy and a horrific vampire epidemic sweeps the country very few humans are left. Along with vampire hunter Mister (Damici), Martin (Paolo) decides to drive to Canada for saftey. This will probebly be a short review. The only way to explain this really is that this is a serious version of ""Zombieland"", only with vampires and not zombies. Both have a older and a younger man who travel together and kill bad guys. They meet a girl on the way who joins them. Only thing this is missing is a cameo by a big name star. Unlike ""Zombieland"" though this one went straight serious and horror, which isn't a bad thing really. Overall, not a bad movie, but I prefer the comedy one better. I give it a C.Would I watch again? - Probebly not, but it made me want to watch ""Zombieland"" again.*Also try - Shadowland & Zombieland"
2,What a waste of money!,What a waste of money! The preview sucked me in! I watched it only because I bought it and that turned out to be shear misery! LOL!
4,good story plot and acting,"This movie was well done. The plot and character development was fairly well done. I would watch it again. For a lower budget film, it beat alot of others out there.."
4,"Amazing, Actually Better Than Many Hollywood Movies","The rest of the reviews tell you about the story line, I just wanted to add that this movie was actually really good. I've seen A LOT of Hollywood movies, in the theaters, that don't add up to this. Just goes to show, if you've got a good story, and good acting, you don't need millions to make a good movie. The movie is interesting, intense in parts, and I even liked the ending... Wow... so cool!"
5,Finally,One of the few horror flicks done right in the last 5 years. Not over done. None to little cgi. Well thought out story. Easy on the shaky cam. I mean really. Us horror fans are pretty easy to please. Well done Stake Land.
1,Turns marketing into rocket surgery.,"This is the approach to marketing that tries to quantify the process instead of illuminate it. When all the formulas are stated, the numbers crunched, the bullet points listed, and the case studies studied, marketers are still left with the same problem: How do I align the whole company behind a single, powerful idea? In this particular effort, your best allies are courage, common sense, and a handful of simple principles. An expensive, five-pound ""bible"" is only good if you want to wake up your colleagues by dropping it on the table. Unless you're a student who has to read this stuff, you're better off buying ""Bottom Up Marketing"" by Trout & Ries or ""The Brand Gap"" by Neumeier, and spending the money you save on a nice dinner."
3,Good overview of concepts and fundamentals,"The overall thoroughness and comprehensive coverage of marketing fundamentals is very appropriate for undergraduate textbook. There are plenty of excercises, illustrations and quasi-mathematical formulae, but the book lacks the depth and insight for the more discerning reader. The text is very thorough and verbose, which makes is boring at times, full with superficial direct conclusions without even an attempt to look at the bigger picture.In my opinion it more retrospective than forward-looking and inspiring. I would highly recommend ""Strategic Marketing Management"" by David Aaker at 1/2 of the price and 1/6 of the size. Also, I personally find inappropriate that Prof. Kotler starts each chapter quoting his own book."
3,Broad Focus,"Kotler is a name synonomous with marketing. I have several of his books and have enjoyed them very much. It is a broad focus though. It doesn't dig very deep into specific industries of course. If you happen to be looking for restaurant marketing specific book recommendations, there are several at the Quantified Marketing Group website at www.quantifiedmarketing.com. We have several complimentary restaurant marketing resources and book recommendations there."
2,useless book,The book has too much information on one page.It's too heavy and too expensive.The exercise questions have no answers and the level of the questions doesn't match to the contents'.
3,3 of 5,"Big Daddy Kane is getting older in age and, judging by these album pictures, plumper in size. His vocals are also starting to sound more labored. When he goes into hardcore battle mode; the Raw vocal delivery he's been known for since ""88‚Ä≥; there's an audible gasp between almost every phrase. The Sex song suggests he's still a multi-ladies man in the bedroom, but his voice is starting to sound more like a veteran church preacher.As far as rap skills go, he's still sonning the competition with a stockpile of funny lyrics. Lyrical Gymnastics, featuring a clever Whitney Houston nod, ranks among his best. But he's generally fallen off a little since the last album. Impressive similes and metaphors have become harder to find among all the corny or awkwardly constructed fillers. ""You think that I be shaving my rhymes,"" he says on the title track, ""Cause they be so smooth.""marcellee.com"
2,Could've been better,"I'm a big Big Daddy Kane fan and take it from me thisalbum could've been a whole lot better, it's a fewstand outs here and there but compared to Big DaddyKane flows of old this just don't cut it. It's likehe just threw this one together for whatever reason,bottom line Big Daddy Kane need better production (Premier, Alchemist, Pete Rock etc.) and he needs to stick to his roots and if he wants to do and R & B track then get a top notch producer and he'll be fine..."
1,"From bad flows to bad choruses, this CD has it all","I saw this CD used... so I picked it up, after hearing E-Dub and Ja Rule give BDK props in the song E-Dub and Ja. I put this in my boom box... Even the hit 'in the projects' was extremeley disappointing. The only song that was HALF decent is the last song. It's not worth even buying the single for, assuming there is 1, tho. Hopefully in the 80s bdk had it going on."
1,There Is A Reason This Is A Cut Out,"Kane started out trying to be rap's answer to Barry White, by 94 it was clear that wasn't working. What's a poseur to do? Needless to say he tries everything (including an absurd Cypress Hill imitation), and none of it works. He sounds especially ridiculous when he claims that he has always been true to his sound. At one point Kane asks `Do You Like This Style Of Rap?', the answer, obviously is no."
4,Better than expected,"While this book does stay on track regarding these ales, if you are looking for recipes or a how to book with specifics you will be disappointed. This book is more an explanation of style than one telling you how to brew a specific brewery's ale. That said I learned a lot about these ales and put it to use when I brewed some recently. I learned much in regard to techniques and basics of style. These ales are not for the new brewer and are difficult and very time consuming to make correctly. This book points the direction but doesn't map the way to brewing successful saisons. I would encourage brewers looking for a challenge to read this book."
4,Informative but wordy,"There was a little too much fluff in the storyline. However, the information about the styles, the grist, yeast types used, mash and fermentation temps, etc, are going to be very useful when I formulate my recipies...."
4,Good history and information on Farmhouse ales,"Some of the reading seemed dry but lots of good historical information about the brewing of farmhouse ales in Belgium and France. I would highly recommend if you have any interest in these uncommon, yet unique beer styles."
3,not what was expected,"This book is very informative but is more a history than a how to, still interesting but not for thosw who want to brew their own"
4,Excellent album - Ghetto Blaster,"I feel like this was the crusaders best album next to ""Street Life"". It has an 80's mainstream jazz vibe (of course, probably because it came in the mid 80's). I love the horn solos in Zala mini. The last song dream street is a great ""mood"" song, it is almost worth it to buy this cd for this last song.All in all a great cd and one of Crusaders best."
4,Good Album,"Okay this is 1984 and VERY late in the day but there isone classic cut here-the opening ""Dead End"",a fine funk jazz romp through everything this band does best!And Neon Ndugu Chancler's choice to leave George Duke's band for theCrusaders added alot of excitment to the mix so how could thisalbum go wrong?Well maybe by filling it out with material not even half as interesting is a way to start.Good but not classic."
3,Great poster but,The quality of this poster is fine but although it arrived rolled in a tube it had fold creases from not being rolled properly. These look a bit bad once the poster is framed. I kept the poster to avoid the hassle of shipping it back but wish the seller had taken better care when packaging it.
1,Stick With Mario Kart,"For a racing game that is just supposed to be fun... it wasn't. The tracks are confusing, especially in multi-player mode. The sound effects (voices) while racing are annoying. The ""camera"" angles make it hard to see the track ahead. All around, it just was not a whole lot of fun.As a fan of Mario Kart, I was expecting more of the same, but maybe a little different. Mickey's Speedway is a very bad spin-off of Mario Kart."
3,"If you don't get Jonathan yet, forget it.","It's not as strong as its predecessor, the brilliant Surrender To Jonathan. Still,anyone who has been following Richman's career since the 70s already knows that any new release will contain at least a few songs that are catchy and charming enough to stick in your head ---permanently. This time,listen for the title track and The Night Is Still Young.This kind of innocence and humour is on the endangered-species list in pop. Docked a couple of stars for a haphazard approach and a below-average quota of memorable songs."
3,JOJO STANDS ALONE..HE DOESN'T NEED ANY OUTSIDE HELP,"OK, THE LYRICS AND THE MELODIES ARE PURE JONATHAN AND THEY ARE STUNNING BUT JOJO DOESN'T NEED ANY HELP FROM THE OUTSIDE! HE IS BRILLIANT ON HIS OWN WITH JUST HIMSELF AND TOMMY.THE SYNTHS ARE TOO MUCH FOR MY EARS AND DON'T FIT WITH JONATHAN'S PERSONAL AND IN YOUR FACE DELIVERY. I WILL SAY THAT IT IS A GOOD LISTEN BUT A TAD OVERDONE.I JUST WANT TO HEAR HIM AND HIS INCREDIBLE GUITAR PLAYING AND HIS ONE OF A KIND VOICE.WHY GILD THE LILY?"
5,"Very glad to have finally ""discovered"" him!","I'm a recent convert, and I'd rank Richman (sorry, can't bring myself to call him by his cute nickname.... yet) up there with Elliott Smith, Rufus Wainwright, Dan Bern, and Lee Feldman... all very gifted song-writers and distinctive singers. None of them hesitates to push the limits, none indulges in meaningless posturing, and none is afraid to sing about the most basic human emotions.Richman manages to do all of this while maintaining that child-like wonder, which comes across in his voice as well as his lyrics. And his songs really stick in your mind.... the only way I got over humming ""Here come the Martian Martians"" was by replacing it with ""Nineteen in Naples""."
1,Good for a Laugh or a coaster,this disc is very funny.I first saw him performing in the movie something about Mary and his voice is a Joke.He sounds Like a Poor Mans David Byrne.the music is Campy.he is closer to Weird Al than Byrne.
2,not a war movie,"This is an adorable, cutesy love drama with WWI as a backdrop. In less than 30 minutes, I turned it off.Search for ""What Price Glory"" trailer on youtube to watch some of it first. This might be an okay rental, if you're into that kind of story line.To see some of my favorite military/war DVDs, click on my name, then click on ""Listmania! Lists""."
1,its just a workbook,"its just a workbook, it has no answer keys for the test, im disappointed that you cant find the answer key anywhere online. how do you know how you are doing without the answer key?"
1,This is pathetic. They can change your licensing even after taking your money.,"When I purchased this item in August, it was allowed to be put on up to 5 devices. When I attempted to put it on my 4th device, an actual kindle, I was told that now it's only active on three devices. Fine, I deauthorized my laptop and put it on the actual kindle. I'm now trying to take it off my iPod touch, device three, to put it on my phone and guess what, now they are telling me that the license changed again to two devices. Because this doesn't work for me, I can buy it elsewhere. What's worse is I paid $36 for the book that has gone to $23. Now I'm given the access as if I paid $23 for a book that I actually paid $36 for the access. I spend over a thousand dollars annually for my college books from this company. I have learned to never do that again. What a waste. More their loss than mine. I lost $36, They lost several hundred (Spring semester 2012)."
2,Not so Original and not Applicable to all industry,"The book presents a not so original theory about business ecosystem. The first few pages present the idea of the book. But following chapters it does not get any better, but too slow and too many sentences created just to filled up the spaces. I might recommend for the reader just to read the summary of the book rather than spending too much time reading this slow paced book.Moreover, It is easy to say that complementory instead of direct competitor is the way to do business in 21st century. But, welcome to the real world James. Ask uncle Bill about this. Keep dream on, dream the bad dreams."
5,Insightful analogy drawn between ecosystems and businesses,"Drawing an analogy between the ecosystem and the business environment, the author provides an insight into how businesses should cope with the ever evolving and changing business environments. The text cites examples of how successful companies define or help shape their ""ecosystems"" and subsequently gain competitive advantage"
4,"Slow going, but still very good conceptually","The downsides: - For those who are familiar with the concepts,this book might be redundant - It takes quite a bit of effort to go throughThe upsides: - Moore's 4 stages illustrate the concept of the 'business ecosystem'very well - Stage 1 is a must read for any entrepreneur - The biological analogies are long, but great for anyone with an interest in scienceThe down-arrow: Any business leader should read this book then immediately look around their 'neighborhood'and begin to create their 'criticality' & 'embededness'"
2,This book is about 150 pages too long,"Moore gives an interesting analogy between business and biological ecosystems.However, it is really an analysis of the Product Life Cycle (PLC) model in differentpackaging. The book is chock full of fancy buzz words that probably won't take holdin the real world any time soon. If you want to buy this book to scan fine, if youread every word you will be asleep in no time."
3,"Business=Ecosystem...?, Inconclusive thesis","This book is much over-hyped. It does build on the ecosystemresearch of Margaret Wheatly. However, the title is misleadingin that the book is really about how old-style individualisticcompetition is dead.Piggy-backs on existing works by others such asMargaret Wheatly, Tom Peters, Alvin Toffler, John Naisbitt,Paul Hawken, etc. Main thesis is inconclusive and weaklysupported by text."
3,Health Careers Today,Great for the basics. I gave it a 3 because it's a little too basic for my liking.
3,LUMIX NOT USER FRIENDLY,"Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20K 5MP Digital Camera with 12x Image Stabilized Optical Zoom (Black) IS NOT ONE OF THE EASIEST CAMERA TO OPERATE. FIRST YOU FIND THAT THE UBS LINKS ARE ARE NOT UNIVERSAL FOR THE CAMERA ITSELF AND YOU MUST USE THEIR EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS THEIR PHOTO SHOP, IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TRANSFER THE PHOTOS ON LINE, PANASONIC SHOULD IS NOT A MAJOR CAMERA MAKER, SO WHY EXCLUDE YOURSELF FROM THE MARKET. THE GOOD POINTS, VIEWING AND PHOTO TAKING ARE STANDARD AND THE CAMERA DOES REACT WELL, BUT THEY NEED TO WORK ON THE USER PART FIRST."
2,Great pictures...... until it stopped working,"I bought this camera for the performance/value it offered. I took it on several trips and the pictures were amazing. Unfortunately, after just 6 months of use(gentle use and no accidents) something inside the lens broke loose and the zoom and focus stopped working. I've tried to contact Panasonic to see where can I get it fixed but no luck, didnt get any replies. Great pictures, not so great durabilty or customer srvice(from Panasonic), you decide."
3,Panasonic FZ20,"I have had this camera for about a month now and have been able to try it in many situations. First of all from a feature standpoint this is a great camera. The only other cameras I've owned that I can compare it to are a Canon G2 and Olympus C750 and I think the FZ20 has the best features and is easiest to use. The main thing to know if you're considering this camera however is it is noisy. I recently made an 8x10 print of a sunny day scene with lots of white clouds and sky and was surprised at how much noise came through. The camera was set at ISO 80 with all options such as sharpness,contrast etc. set to standard. In the cameras defense I will say there is a lot of detail in the pictures and in many situations the noise wouldn't be so noticeable."
3,Panasonic Lumix Cameras,"The FZ20K 5mp camera has many impressive features and a excellent Leica lens but I too purchased a Panasonic LC33 camera a little over 1 year ago and are experiencing problems turning the camera on. It happens if the camera shuts down during taking pictures or videos due to low battery. After replacing the batteries the camera will not turn on. Sofar I managed to get it going again after 4 or 5 new batteries - all of a sudden it comes to life. Panasonic was no help at all, their customer service dept did not care - all the wanted was $[...] to fix the camera. I would be reluctant to buy another Panasonic at this time."
5,Fine camera,"I have found that the IQ of the FZ20 is very close to that of a dSLR. I prefer the bigger FZ models like the FZ10, 15, 20, 30 and 50. I think they may make better images than smaller bodied FZs plus I like their feel more.I actually like the FZs better than a dSLR. I've owned dSLRs and personally I don't feel they are worth the bother of the extra bulk, weight, changing lenses, expense, etc. The FZ has a sharp Leica 35-420 mm lens plus full manual control, which is all I really need in a camera."
5,An awesome camera for the price!,"I bought this camera on Amazon for $299. Most of the reviews I read for this camera were a little mixed, so I wasn't sure if I wanted to risk it. However, for the price, it seemed a relatively safe risk to take. It's a wonderful camera. It looks and feels solid. It's a little larger and bulkier than I expected, but not too bad. Colors are bright and vibrant, particularly in daylight settings. Very easy to use and the image stabilization is such a useful feature. The 12x optical zoom is amazing. I have no idea what I did before I had it. I would recommend this camera to anyone."
5,Best Digital Camera for the Money!,"You cannot beat the feature, function, usabliity, quality of these Panasonic cameras for the money.I recently gave this to my sister, that never picked one up before, for a trip. Set it on ""P"" mode and she took close to 400 very nice pictures. I like it because you can go full manual mode to full auto mode.With good light you can get pictures that compare to much more expensive SLRs. Down side is that the high ISO settings are not really that usable. I try to shoot outdoors at ISO 64, and indoors at 100 or 200. At ISO 400 the noise is just too high. Interestingly, I have been able to get decent movies indoors at times when stills were unacceptable."
1,"I agree, Panasonic cameras don't last","I bought a Panasonic Lumix FZ20 in May, 2005. I used it often, but handled it very carefully. I have other digital and film cameras I use more and have had longer. In February, 2006, the camera just stopped working. It still looked like new and absolutely nothing had been done to it to render it completely useless. I sent it to the Mack Warranty people (those warranties are a joke, by the way) who sent it to Panasonic, telling me that they don't cover repairs WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR!!! Then the repair department at Panasonic returned the camera after two months, saying it would cost more to repair than it was worth. So I was SOL - out of a camera after less than a year of use.I think the Panasonic Lumix cameras were badly made in the first place and that's why their new version of the camera, the FZ30, is almost entirely different from the FZ20 - it doesn't even use the same battery. It's different in almost every way.Beware Panasonic. They just don't last."
5,Panasonic winner,"I have waited patiently since July when this camera was first announced by Panasonic. I went to forums and read reports from everywhere in the world but the U.S. (just released for U.S sales a week ago.)The wait was worth it. I have been sleeping with the camera for a week now and am delighted with the features and ergonomics of this instrument and at the top is the Leica lense, This camera is state of the art at present and comes at an affordable pricefor such a package. Did I mention it takes great pictures?"
3,No long exposure capability,"I've had this camera for a few years now and love it, BUT I have discovered that I cannot do long exposures needed for most night photography.The maximum built-in exposure time is 8 seconds, far too little for most night photography. It's a great camera if you don't want to do time exposures but a big disappointment if you do."
5,Lumix DMC-FZ20 has no competition in this price range!,"I researched extensively and found nothing but positive comments from pro magazines and online shoppers. The specs are amazing for a camera in this price range. Even with all that going for it, the camera still exceeded my expectations. Everything about the design of this camera was well though out. Despite the wealth of features, I had most figured out in minutes without reading the exceptional manual. I got more great shots in my first soccer game with this camera than I had in 4+ years with my previous camera! Look no further, this is the best camera for the money by far!"
1,Panasonic Cameras dont last,I bought a LC33 just over a year ago and the thing died on me. I took real good care of the camera. It still looks brand new it just wont power on. I call customer service and they will not do anything to resolve this issue. I found reviews on the camera and other people said the same thing. Give this camera one year before buying it and see what people are saying. The good reviews may change it will be a matter of time.
1,ruined our expectations,"It sounded like this would be a pretty good-quality comforter, but it turned out to be a pack of lies. The down filling was poor and some patches were almost totally empty. We were really disappointed and sent it back."
4,Unexpected gem,"This book was recommended to me by a friend and I was quite pleasantly surprised. Pam Crooks is able to draw her readers in with vivid imagery, complex characters and an action-packed plot. It is nearly impossible to put the book down due to wanting to know what will happen with Trig and Carleigh, as well as discovering the secrets Carleigh's mother holds.This is the first book I've read by Ms. Crooks but it will not be the last."
2,dissappointing....,"I've read another book by this author-Lady Gypsy-and gave it five stars-it was a wonderful book. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for this book. From page one every character is throughly unlikable. Any romance that opens on a scene in an opium den-well that should have given me a clue. This books storyline is based on lies, secrets and a host of unpleasantness.The hero has his own motives and the heroine is frankly a spoiled brat who wants to be treated like a queen but is extremly naive about the ways of the world.Implausibilities abound- like fifty pages into the book the author has the two characters having sex while barely knowing more than each others names, and the hero forces his way into her room.Simply annoying-this author can do better than this. Skip this one:(2 stars."
1,Peg Perego Venezia Stroller is great but carseat is TERRIBLE,"I purchased the Peg Perego carseat only because I wanted the Peg Perego Venezia stroller. However, I have now learned that Peg Perego sells a travel system adaptor (all 2005 strollers come with the adaptor) that allows any carseat to fit within the stroller. The Peg Perego carseat is TERRIBLE...it is to narrow and too deep (my daughter looked so uncomfortable and would cry every time I put her in it). I also found that I had a difficult time locking the carseat into the base and had to climb into the SUV to secure it everytime. Lastly, the sun shield didn't even extend over the top of her head and was useless. I have since then purchased the Graco Snuggle Ride and love it. It is much more user friendly (it clicks into it's base with one hand) and have purchased the Peg Perego stroller adaptor so that I can use my Graco carseat and stroller together."
4,LOVE MY VIAGGIO!,"I absolutely love this car seat! I bought it to compliment my P3 and I absolutely love it!I've been in a car accident with a baby, so the High crash test ratings mean a lot to me. It's just not worth risking!I like that the handle can be reversed to act a roll bar. (One of the only car seats that offers this)I had the same problem with the tag coming off, so I just ended up removing it and it looks better without it.I wish Peg Perego would make the hood a bit larger and then it would be 5 stars all the way!"
2,Expensive and Perego gives no other options,"I bought a Pliko 3 stroller in Dec 2004 (300 dollars!) and did not want to buy this seat as my baby is very big and the seat is small. I wish the previous reviewer was correct that you can buy an adapter so that any car seat can be used with the stroller - - I called Peg Perego and they told me it is not available seperately and to get a travel system, I need to buy the 2005 stroller or the car seat. I would consider a seperate travel system..."
4,ERMM!.....Cool,"Ok let me just anounce that i am actually a dance music producer so i dont normally listen to jazz apart from at college, but as part of the college motto `Broaden your interest' well i thought that i might aswell atleast try to understand jazz.So i come to this site and had a listen to some of the tunes on offer including this one, and had actually thought it was fairly good due to the rythem of the tunes there is a certain vibe that leaves you feeling jiggy of some sort.And normally when i listen to jazz it uaually annoise me but this one did not so there fore i rate it quite well, in my opinion its got to be one of the most exciting jazz albums for me anyway, but any jazz fans outthere i recomend this to ya as a taste of something with a bit of zest or VaVaVa VOOM!.Thanx"
5,This music will appeal also to every fan of prog music...,"I think it's one of the best solo-albums in the last ten years.Well it's not ""Jetro tull music"" and the whole album is instrumental, but it's so tasteful and suitable for all lovers of classical orchestration...that it will appeal to every fan of prog music as well. Perhaps it's the best effort by Ian Anderson so far and in my opinion it's better than all the latter Jethro Tull albums. The production is excellent and should be well worth checking out!!"
5,Ian Anderson's best effort in years!,"Ian Anderson *is* Jethro Tull. How wonderful it is to hear himable to express himself in the classical medium without havingto restrict himself to the beautiful--though formula-driven--format for which Jethro Tull is loved and famous.The sound, particularly the violins, flute, bells, and harp isstunning: there isn't the usual ""mush"" that can occur when theinstruments play together. This CD will test the presence andsoundstage of your system!Ironically, I'm not a real ""flute man,"" so for those of you whodon't like Ian's often excesses with the damn instrument, you'llbe *very* happy here: he achieves a wonderful balance."
5,"Ian Anderson, himself","Ever since the album Songs from the Wood, I've wanted to discuss theology with Ian Anderson. This album feels almost like doing it."
2,Dishonest with its material,"A basically dishonest movie, lacking the courage of its convictions. This oscar-winning movie is in favor of illegal abortion, adultery, law breaking, disobedience of authority, yet it is shot in soft focus, like a Capra, feel-good movie!. The constant references to Dickens are more wishful than actual; old Charles would most likely be against all the values this film celebrate."
2,Cider House Rules,"This movie left me thinking that the plot was to lead the viewer to believe that the young man had no future except to follow in the old doctor's footsteps, return to the orphange and perform abortions. I am thowing the DVD away."
2,Disappointment,"I saw this movie. The story is the fiction of someone's fertile imagination not based on fact in any way. Children in orphanages during WW1 and WW2 were there because their parents could not take care of them for different reasons. I doubt that abortions were ever performed in orphanages. I lived in one and while there was a hospital on the grounds, abortions were never performed. I don't feel abortions are ever justified and I found no enjoyment in seeing it portrayed in a movie."
1,Truth in Advertising,"With the hope that you will not be mislead as I was, you need to know that this movie is a story about a kindly, old abortionist and his protege.If you can live with that, it's a good film. If your conscience is troubled with the presentation of a pair of abortionists as ""nice guys"", you will be put off by the film.I destroyed my copy."
5,A little bit of everything,"Get the kleenex out. It will make you cry, laugh and think! Don't forget to watch the deleted scenes, and extra ""the making of cider house rules""."
5,A beautiful and touching movie,"Michael Caine portrays Dr. Larch who runs an orphanage. He performs deliveries or abortions, depending on the wishes of his patients. He arranges for adoptions and cares for those orphans who are not adopted. One of the children, Homer Wells, becomes like a son to him and he trains him to succeed him at the orphanage. Homer disapproves of the abortion end of Larch's business and decides to go out into the world to see new things. He admits to his companions that he has never seen the ocean, nor has he seen a lobster, although he has spent his entire life in Maine. Homer falls in love and learns about the good and evil side of the people with whom he comes in contact. This is a wonderful movie with brilliant acting and a very moving story--the best I've seen in quite sometime."
3,"Didn't read the book, but the film","I thought the film was lacking in what motivated the main character to chose path at the end of the film. I really didn't sense that he had learned enough of the world beyond the orphanage to smooth his rough edges (like glass by the ocean sand) and to settle into his chosen profession.The performances were good, but the motivation of the characters' was lacking."
4,"Michael Caine Rules, Hallstrom Does Too","Director Lasse Hallstrom, who gave us the beautiful ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"", admirably presents the nuances of character, emotion, and relationships that make John Irving's bittersweet adaptation of his own novel so compelling. Michael Caine, his American accent aside, excels as the parternal Dr. Larch and Tobey Maguire is well-cast as Homer, the doe-eyed youth who ventures from the familial orphanage to experience life. The cinematography is exquisite and evocative. As Homer ultimately learns, the validity of the Cider House Rules (and, by extension, all rules) is subjective; but, by the time we reach this epiphany, it hardly seems revelatory considering Homer was raised by an abortionist, and one who taught him the trade, at that. There is a lot of love here, but also a moral ambivalence. In this film, as in life, there are no easy answers. It's for you to decide. Just be sure you see it."
5,"A wonderful book, a wonderful film.","It disturbs me when people who have no idea of Irving's works and ideology dismiss a great film based on an even greater novel as ""pro-abortion propoganda.""""The Cider House Rules"" is not propoganda of any sort, nor is it pro-anything. It's a movie. It's also a book. Both mediums tell a story. Yes, the story does include bits about abortion, but is that all it's about? No. ""The Cider House Rules"" is a coming-of-age story about a young man who learns to shape his future. IT is about relationships, it is about love, it is about destiny. Abortion is only apart of this complex web of people and interaction; it is not IT.Five stars for this magnificent film."
4,Outstanding Movie,"This movie probably won't change your mind about your particular beliefs but it likely will give you pause to consider your conscience with respect to such things as loyalty, drug abuse, abortion, commitment, and even difficult topics to address such as finding redemption at death, and quite a series of morally imprecise character interactions. If you're looking for the mean terrible Bad Guy to get put in his place by the helpless innocent Good Guy, you won't want to watch this movie. If you want a movie to inspire you to examine our at-best imperfect world, and your understanding of your place in it, give this a view."
4,For young and for old!,"Well, although when I watched the movie I was but 14 yaers old,( I am now 16). I can say that I liked it! I know that you must be thinking ""what? this is a wierd kid"", but the truth is that I have always had a certain inclination towards this kind of movie, and although i think that the book is much better, i think that the movie lives up to it enough for me to have enjoyed it. I always like the issue, both in the book and movie, and the superb acting in the movie makes the whole experience even more enjoyable. I recomend this movie to anyone who thinks they have enogh maturity to understand it and to take it seriousley, as did i. This goes for grown ups and youg people alike. thank you!"
1,Awfully disappointing,"I read the book first. It's a wonderful story, but compared to the text, the movie is didactic, the characters flat, and the whole intonation terribly false. The movie makes the orphanage to look like a kindergarten birthday party, Dr. Larch and the nurses like Sunday charity workers, and Homer Wells like a stuttering half-wit. None of this is in the book. It's a shame it got so maimed."
4,Cider House Fools,"Could be that I was a little harsh on the title but I was thinking of the scene in which the hero falls in love with the heroine who was so wishy-washy over the young war pilot that it made me sorta, well, ill. The doctor's performance is extraordinary (as usual) and the nurses are superb. The children add a definite charm and give the movie substance. As I watched the movie, I became quite involved with the story and found myself rewinding some parts to simply enjoy a scene again. The actual Cider House Rules are a bit off-beat and really don't play much into the story but the story itself is surprising and wonderfully portrayed by the actors. I really liked this movie."
4,Very good,"This story touches on various important themes - rites of passage, freedom vs. responsibility, etc. - but like certain real life events or lessons, it's one of those things that you experience and then move on. This is not a movie for watching over and over. That would be missing the point. I saw it once, enjoyed it very much, and invite you to do the same."
4,The Cider House does rule,"I've got to admit, I love almost anything with Michael Caine in it, and I certainly liked this film as well. It starts off with an orphanage being one of the main scenes in the story and goes on to show one of the main characters, Homer Wells (Toby Mcguire), how the world can look very beautiful, but be filled with pain and ugliness. It's a journey out into the world and home again, and the joys and trials that go with it."
4,Great Movie,I just felt this movie was one of the best I'd seen in the past ten years.It dealt with a very controversial subject long before it was politically correct to discuss it. I think the actors chosen were excellent.I'd watched it through Netflix but I still wanted my own copy.
2,Not Bad,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. It's not horrible, the themes and subject matter of the movie is highly controversial and might make some viewers uncomfortable depending upon their personal opinions on abortion. Somehow, though, this movie sensitively and affectively conveys the subject matter in a way that's watchable. Even though the acting was mediocre, I really liked Tobey Mcguire as the main character (i think he's such a cutie...). However, i felt that this movie was just way too long. It tends to drag along and barely picks up until it comes to the most emotional scenes, which I have to admit were a bit abject and hard to watch. But overall, the film is packed with emotion and is worth renting at least once."
2,boring and pointless,"i thought this film was not only not good, but definitely not oscar-nominated worthy. it was boring, simply boring. it did not draw me in to like the characters. i didnt really care what happened to them. Flash Gordon was a better movie than this one."
2,.... homer who?,"...Irving must have been in dire straits to accept payment for this adaptation .... cramming over 40-years into a couple of hours can't be easy , BUT completely obliterating two of the most relevant and interesting characters in the novel ( Angel & Melanie .... WHO ? you ask ,if you haven't read it) pretty much makes it a big waste of time & Caine's talent.... I was quite sad after viewing the film, my anticipation of seeing the roles played out as written in the novel & expecting the characters to age & develop as read over years of growth left me feeling totally cheated. IF YOU'VE READ THE NOVEL , DON'T BUY, RENT OR EVEN PEEK=IN ON THIS MOVIE... it will break your heart to witness the butchery ...."
5,All authors should help direct the film adaptation!,"One of my favorite books has been made into a movie that magically captures the heartfelt tone that makes the novel a wonderful read. Admittedly, I never imagined Homer's love as a beauty like Charlize Theron, but Caine and Maguire might as well have had their pictures on the cover of the first edition. The film has made me look forward to rereading the novel, yet another time.One caveat: if you lack empathy for folks who make mistakes in life or who are the victims of those mistakes; if you believe the First Amendment guarantees the freedom to choose YOUR religion or none at all; and, if you imagine that ignorance is a defensible point-of-view (and therefore that movie previews should spell out the details of the film, to protect the sensibilities of those who couldn't be bothered to read the book), then I suggest strongly that you skip this purchase."
5,Deserving of All its Praise,"The Cider House Rules was a wonderful film, full of happy and terrifying moments. I have to admit my favorite character was Fuzzy (the little blond boy who plays Dewy on Malcolm in the Middle). Beside his physical image of innocence, his life is so full of wonder and awe that you just want to hold him in your lap everytime he's on screen.This is definantly and adult movie, and I was especially engaged by the openness with which the film dealt with abortion and incest. It was truly heart-wrenching and beautiful, all at once. It was a wonderful movie to watch."
5,Just a good film,"This film is so good because it is so matter-of-fact yet still so sweet. This film is about living life and learning lessons, and it has a sense of closure so you do not feel like you missed something after watching it. It has a sense of old-time character mixed with sincerity, belonging, passion, love and self-discovery.The acting is superb and maintains a quality lacking in so many modern films. If you are looking for a good film to watch, I recommend this. I would call it the perfect movie."
4,3 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:The Cider House Rules is a bit meandering but it's an effective and sometimes moving character piece that highlights a wonderful performance by Michael Caine in an all-around solid piece of filmmaking.
2,Typical Academy Award Nominee Movie,"Although it tries to create some controversy about key issues like abortion or incest, this movie is nothing more than an average story about two cute innocent youngsters who begin to deal with the real world and its diverse difficulties. Director Lasse Hallstrom intends to deliver some mildly shocking material here to provide thoughtful deep questions, but it is presented in a common, simplified and almost soap opera-like way. The rest is a sweet little romance between the appealing leads Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron, two cofused young adults who don`t understand their envoironment. To their credit, they perform their roles well, as does Michael Caine, so there`s still a reason to watch the movie. Overall, though, it`s just another fluffy well-made Hollywood movie with pleasant direction and a plot that could have been from an above average TV-movie.Probably worth watching once, and that`s it."
1,"The search for honest, genuine, responsibility has failed","The orphanage is neat, and is portrayed in a nice, familyish way. The care that is shown there is touching. Beyond that, I search for someone that stands out as true, genuine, and responsible, and I don't find one. The meaninglessness of life without God is starkly portrayed."
3,great,i thought this was pretty good. inever read the book so i cant compare.this movie is sad thopugh but thats not a bad thing. i loved the perfomaces by the leads. alos kerian culkin and erik per sullivan are good as buster and fuzzy.
4,"Strong Cinematography, Heartwarming Story","Cider House Rules is a fine account of the journeys of Homer, an orphan boy. Tobey Maguire portrays the lead role very well displaying much innocence and curiosity of the wrold around him. Some may be offended by his stance on abortions, but to me I can look beyond politics. Michael Caine is fine in a supporting role as Dr. Lerch. There are certainly many elements to his multi-faceted character. Also, Delroy Lindo stands out quite notably as the lead migrant worker on the farm Homer goes to live. its interesting how Lindo's character both loves his daughter as a father and as a lover. You want to think of Lindo as evil but there is another side to him particularly in the final scene in which he appears.As evolving as the story is, there are many beautfiul scenery shots where the skyline is just stunning. The architecture of the orphanage just completes the aesthetic beauty. Overall, this earns my recommendation on all accounts."
1,HATE IT TOO VIOLETE,I saw alot of people BUTT NAKED and talking like ****. If you are 15 or 16 don't see this JUNK i am 14 so just don't!!!!!!
3,A great movie...Until the Theme is Revealed,"A great movie for adults and growing teenagers of the maturing of an orphan (Tobey Maguire) who decides to take his risks of living out in the open world instead of the confined spaces of the welcoming home he grew up in. The movie touches every corner of a modern-day classic, with its theme and direction. The cinematography is used just right to create the specific moods, and the screenplay, adapted from John Irving's classic, was well-done in taking a literary epic and putting it on the big screen. However, the movie is not for everyone. The movie will most likely offend conservative views and lift the liberal points of life. The major theme of the movie and the answer to your question if you should see it or not is, ""Is abortion just?"""
3,Pretty Good Film,this Film Worked in that it discussed Issues&Taboo Topics.but compared to the Book it's not as strong.the acting is a little all over the place.Michael Caine handles the first part&Delroy Lindro handles the Mid-second part.it's like two films in one in many instances.it's a film that needed to be told but it gets a bit scattered.still for it's time period&different Subject Matters worth a Viewing but not for the easily Offended.
4,Good movie doesn't live up to the Oscar hype,"I enjoyed ""Cider House Rules."" The high point of thismovie was the main character. Caine gives a good performance, but his character doesn't grab me like a ""best supporting actor"" ought to. There are parts of the story line that are sketchy in the movie which is why the four instead of five stars. A better title would have been ""From St. Cloud"" because the image of the cider house rules, while powerful, is not completely played out. As far as viewing pleasure goes--this one will provide a nice two-hours' get-away on a cool fall evening. END"
3,read the book instead,"The book was wonderful. The movie is average, and in several important aspects, does not follow the book at all - neither in the charcters nor the events. On the other hand, The World According to Garp was a terrific book - the movie followed it more faithfully, and it was an average movie. So, the moral is - read the book. John Irving is a terrific storyteller."
4,"Great little guy's ""leapster""","This toy is a perfect substitute ""leapster"" for my toddler who always wants to play with his big brother's toys. Teaches ABCs and numbers, while making him feel like a ""big boy"" too."
2,definitely for young children!,"I bought three of these for 3 year old toddlers. I thought they would love it, but they weren't so crazy about it. It definitely is a durable toy that I would recomend for a younger toddler. Just doesn't do enough to keep the attention span of 3-5 year olds."
2,not so impress,Looks like a pretty good touch screen... good working learning toy for your child... and second not really impress... yet didn't even mail it with any battery.. av to get own... cheap
1,pretty lame,"This toy is not very interactive. It displays letters and numbers on the screen, but the child can only push buttons to start the sequence. It's good for the car, but not a great toy overall."
5,Basic and Not Overwhelming!,"My daughter received this as a gift when she was 3 years old. It is a very basic toy, but she loved it. The stylus doesn't do much but that's okay. The blue screen in the center shows the letters of the alphabet (or numbers 1 thru 10) one at a time in bright led lights and a happy voice announces the names of the letters and numbers. At the end of the alphabet a little ""hurray"" sound is played. It is very simple, but my daughter loved taking it in the car. I know she loved the sound of the sing-song voice, even if it is a bit loud. I sincerely believe this really helped my daughter learn her alphabet as she loved to sing along with it. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. The only flaw I see in the toy is that there is no off button or volume low/high, otherwise it's a cute stocking stuffer or travel toy!"
3,Playskool Magic Screen Palm Learner,"After watching a son-in-law play with this toy at a family gathering, I purchased it to put in his Christmas stocking. As you can tell, my feedback will not be helpful as far as it being used as a childrens toy."
3,A ok movie,"this movie was pretty good, but I dint like some of it. Or I thought some of it was not very scary. I dont know it is a ok movie but it is really not scary."
3,Old suspens,"C'est un film qui a mal vieilli. Rien √† dire au sujet de l'interpr√©tation, mais le d√©cor comme les situations sont poussi√©reux et, malheureusement, l'intrigue n'apporte aucune surprise : on sait d√®s le d√©but que tout finira par s'arranger et que la pauvre h√©rone sera sauv√©e in-extremis.Le plaisir vient tout de mme de cet effet r√©tro, de ce faux suspense qui finit par amuser, et qui pousse le spectateur a rester jusqu'au g√©n√©rique final, en se disant qu'il pourra s'endormir ensuite tranquillement sans faire de cauchemars."
2,Spiral Staircase,Movie starts out good abd the charactors are play will but the end is very weak and a let down!
4,The Spiral Staircase,"What a classic thriller! A young women has been mute since she was a girl - Helen, played by Dorothy McGuire. She is living in an large old house with an elderly women, played by the wonderful Ethel Barrymore and her two sons played by George Brent and Gordon Oliver. There is a young Doctor, played by Kent Smith who is looking out the Helen and is interested in helping her. There seems to have been a murder recently of a young girl. Mrs. Warren(Ethel Barrymore) seems to know a lot more then she is telling. On a dark and raining night each person in the house comes to face some under lieing fear that grips everyone eventually. The lighting is very interesting and the acting is top noch. For those of you who really enjoy the who-done-it and thriller genre this is one of the best."
4,The Spiral Stair Case,"Great old movie. Everything is creepier when left to ones imagination. Scary old ""who dun it""."
5,It works!,"Seems to work well. Only time will tell. But, it's got to be better than some of those probe thermometers that cost a lot of $$$ and last 3 uses. I spend a bunch on a digital thermometer, just like on Good Eats. It didn't last through Thanksgiving. I wouldn't mind paying a lot more for a thermometer, if they would just last one year."
3,Meat Therm. Quick Read,Nice design. I bought this as a quick read--and a fast grab for my cooking area..I normally use a more expensive digital Read-out design..I tested this purchase from Amazon against my Digital-and its about 2-degree's[F]..different..I noticed its PROBE-works differently--than my more expensive design. I would say at this early time---its a Big MEAT..Thermometer..not really for slender probes../but large roasts and poultry. The probe must be sunk--deep. Its accurate.SECOND-review..I used this for a oven turkey and its really accurate.
2,Not As Accurate As I Would Like,"I keep looking for an easy to read cooking thermometer and I will have to continue to look. I read the reviews and thought my search was over however I believe this thermometer is not all that accurate.Especially with poultry I wish to get it done but not dry, each time I rely on this device the chicken or turkey is done to the point of very dry.Whereas when I cut the meat open even when this thermometer indicates it is not done to my surprise the meat is indeed done and not dry.I will continue to look for a quality and accurate thermometer, hopefully I can locate one manufactured in the United States and I pay whatever it takes to acquire something more reliable. I am generous with a two star rating only for the large face and easy to read but inaccurate numbers"
3,not completely diswasher safe,"the product description describes this as safe for washing in a dishwasher. that's not entirely correct. granted it didn't fall apart or fail to work the next time it was used, but the face ""glass"" did get clouded up pretty well. not so bad you can't read it, but cloudy nevertheless."
4,"Great Thermometer, Not really red though...","As much as I wanted a digital thermometer, a truly nice one costs too much. I got this one because its dishwasher safe, oven safe, wont roll off the counter, is large- easy to read, and is red. Well all of the above is true except for the last bit. It is much more or a brick red than a bright red as shown, like borderline brown. Disappointing, but not worth sending it back since I love all of its other features! It works well and seems to be good quality."
1,Piece of cr*p,"This never worked, not even the first few times we thought it was working. We ruined lamb and steak on the grill. I guess you really have to shell out the money for a decent one, because what's the point in spending a little getting nothing? The only positive thing I can say (read, '1 star') is that the silicone around the edge is convenient, if you want to use that word for a piece of garbage. It keeps your stupid thermometer from rolling around -- that part DOES work."
2,Temp not Accurate,I bought this with the reviews that this was a good thermometer. Several times the meat stated it was not done but cooking longer resulted in dry meat. It has caused alot of frusteration. I will be seeking out yet another one.
5,best video ever,"The Best of Groucho VHS 2 Volume Setthis is by far the best groucho video set out there, I have watched this one hundreds of times!!"
2,dissappointing,"please dont buy this, the recording quality is poor, something went wrong in the studio when they were compiling these tracks, some of the songs art at tape cassette quality.I bought this cd because i wanted the hustlers theme by last emporer, apart from that this cd is garbage."
5,DOPE HIPHOP!,"PLEASE IGNORE ANYONE WHO GAVE THIS BEATMINERZ ALBUM 1 OR 2 STARS. THEIR JUST COMPLETE MORON'S AND NEED TO BE BANNED FROM PURCHASING ANY FUTURE HIPHOP CD'S.BRACE 4 IMPAK IS BANGING FROM BEGINNING TO END. IT OPEN'S UP WITH A BOOMINN BASS TRACK CALLED ""DEVASTATIN"" FEATURING BUCKSHOT AND THE CD JUST FLOWS FROM THERE. THE TRACK ""OPEN"" HAS ONE OF THE SMOOTHEST BEATS AND R N B HOOKS YOU'LL EVER HEAR. ANOTHER BANGING BEATMINERZ ALBUM. FF---C ALL THE HATERSSSSSSS DOING REVIEWS."
2,SOLIDLY WACK,I waited forever to get this CD thankfully it only cost me 1 cent. This has got to be the worst effort I have ever heard from Da Beatminerz its almost as if Evil D and crew were asleep at the boards throughout 90 percent of this CDs production. Their are only 5 songs that I listen to on this album. You may see some good reviews for this album (like the guy who copied his 5 star review 20 times to make the rating scale go up) but dont be fooled this is a terrible album from one of the greatest production squads of all time. I dont know about you but I am starting to worry about Rawkus and the future of there label. They have not had a quality release in years and this album shows why. I gave this two stars because their are 5 good songs but even for 1 cent you would still be better off downloading the album. It is truly sad that someone might have actually had to pay 18 to 20 dollars for this at a music store.
1,This album is wack,"I was so, so disappointed with this album, and I was waiting forever for it to come out. The beats are so bad that I had to ask, ""This IS a Beatminerz album, right?"" Also, the rappers don't really kick anything to say ""true dat"" about. The only song worth listening to is ""How We Ride"" with Heather B. and Freddie Foxxx. You see the number of reviews for this album. It must mean that not many people listened or bought this album, and for good reason."
3,"Slow down and get fuzzy, Batman",The billion dollar company selling this video decided to shave a few cents off their cost by recording in LP rather that SP. It is a shame they did not produce a higher quality product.
2,Not as Well Thought out as Mr. Freeze,"Like Mr. Freeze in the current animated Batman continuity, Poison Ivy suffers from the harm dealt by the increasing industrialization and the encroachment of applied science in the natural world. Having said that, I also note that she lacks the tragic dimension that Mr. Freeze embodies--the stories present her more as an emotional creature given to hysteria. As a result, she seems more impulsive and childish than any of the other Batman Rogues Gallery. The fantastic science fiction elements of what she can make plants do (she has horticultural skills that would shock any biogeneticist) also undercut sympathy for her illness.The tapes in this series because they are not recorded in SP mode. You will get fuzzy pictures and sound."
5,"If I could rate this book 6 stars, I would.",This is truly a remarkable book. It contains a compendium of knowledge on civil defense approaches for surviving a nuclear war. Much of this material will apply directly to impact threats from asteroids and comets. It's a book you can stake your life on.
5,Get this for monkey bone walker,Most of this album is forgettable but Monkey Bone Walker is worth the entire cost of the CD
5,Among the best Crusaders Did,"Underrated gem! IMHO please forget the songs with Joe Cocker. Nothing bad about him but he just doesn't fit the Crusaders sound like Randy Crawford did.Please lsiten tp the other funky swingin songs like ""Sunshine in your eyes"" and the Title song - ""Standing Tall"". They are masterly played and arranged and just makes me so happy!"
5,Live at the Brooklyn House December 1964,"26 great songs live in one show, with Murry the K as the MC. 17 groups all on one long CD, they just don't make 'em like this anymore!"
2,"This wax didn't melt very well, even when ...","This wax didn't melt very well, even when following the directions, which made it very difficult (and even painful) to spread on the areas to be waxed. I tried to wax my bikini area and found it virtually impossible to pull the strip in the opposite direction of growth, since the hair grows in many different directions. Consequently, the hair was painfully pulled -- but not pulled out. I even experienced some bleeding. They provided plenty of cloth and the wax would presumably last through several waxings. Also, it washes off with warm water, as advertised, and there are good directions in the package, and I didn't experience extended discomfort after pulling off the cloth. However, I wouldn't recommend this product, because it's difficult and painful to use."
3,This was my first time using any kind ...,"This was my first time using any kind of waxing product. Although it was messy, it did the job well. I used the Nair on two locations -- my legs and my bikini area. On my legs I was able to successfully remove the hair. It was painful, but tolerable. As for my bikini area, that was another story. I actually had to stop because it hurt so badly. Also, this left me with only two sheets of waxing paper. My advice is to use the paper as sparingly as possible. I do think that I'll stick to traditional shaving. But, I'll try this product again for a special occasion. Like a summer vacation."
2,"This is the first waxing product I've tried, ...","This is the first waxing product I've tried, and I found that it hurt a lot more than I expected. It's also sticky and messy. I found that it even hurt to apply the wax. Personally, I think I'll stick to shaving."
1,doesn't anybody read carefully?,"Because of the PBS program on Paris (Dec. 2010)I looked back at the career of Ms. Fitch, which has been quite entrepreneurial. I haven't read any work of hers after the Beach book (haha), which disappointed me rather keenly because it gradually became clear to me that she had not read Ulysses. So I read some of the Amazon and Google reviews to see if this had become well known. Nobody seems to know it, and obviously her career has not suffered. I am particularly amused by the reviewers who buy into her idea that Beach should get a lot of the credit for Ulysses, and Joyce not so much."
3,sylvia beach and the lost generation: a history of literary paris in the twenties and thirties,too much about james joyce and not enough about the store-would rather have read more about paris....still not too bad...
5,pure improvisational genius,"Sam Rivers is going on 80, and is finally getting some long overdue public recognition for what his fellow musicians have always known -- he is a master of his craft. These trio recordings from 1973 are Rivers at his finest, as he moves from tenor to soprano sax, piano, and wordless vocals. The drums and bass are absolutely outstanding throughout -- it is truly telepathic engagement. Rivers' great '60s Bluenote records are currently available only as a Mosaic box (well worth looking for!), and need to be reissued so Sam can continue to reach the listeners now hearing his big band compositions and these searingly brilliant improvisations from the days before the deadly neoclassical ""impulse"" set in like a toxic cloud over the ever-searching essence of jazz!"
3,Lifetime Supreme Vital Hair Vitamins,"I have only been taking this vitamin a short time, but so far I have not seen any good results or new hair growth."
3,"Being a Mitchum user, I was excited to ...","Being a Mitchum user, I was excited to try this product. I found that the solid didn't stick as well as the clear gel -- I felt as though I didn't have deodorant on. Another thing I didn't like was that when you put your clothes on, the white came off on your clothes. I purposely wore black twice to test this. In my opinion, the solid would probably be good for men, but not for women. It did glide on easily. To compare the two, the clear gel is definitely a better product for the reasons cited above. I don't believe I'd buy the solid."
2,Not at all what I was hoping for,"I bought this book hoping to expand on my knowledge of kites, and get an idea or two for building creature kites. This book was a HUGE dissapointment in this respect.Essentially this book is nothing but painting patterns for the same kite over and over. The build for all the kites detailed here are virtually identical: Fold a sheet of ""Tyvek"" in half, fold a couple of times, paint it to look like something (the most tedious portion of the build on these kites), and glue a bunch of sticks to the back of the paper.Presto! you have a buterfly! or a swallow! or a dragonfly!You will find no box kites, no stunt kites, or anything besides the same folded ""Tyvek"" kites detailed in the book.After looking at the book once, I'm afraid it will remain on my shelf, while I spend some time building an interesting delta kite or something."
2,Lack of Quality,"I am very disapointed in Melissa and Doug products in general and this puzzle is no exception. They continue to advertise products as ""wood"" and ""hand crafted"" but really they are made in China and overpriced. The wood is jagged in many spots, there is particle board shavings and dust all over the product, and they have stickers instead of hand painted pictures. I also think the pictures under the puzzle pieces are generic, peeling upon arrival, and lack any fun or interest to a small child (or an adult for that matter). Disapointing."
1,Melissa& Doug easy grip shapes puzzle,"The fronts of all the pieces and board are made of paper. My son chewed off half of a piece's sticker and was swallowing it all within 5 mins, i had to take it away from him. Very poor design.Unfortunately, this puzzle is going into the trash, instead of being used and enjoyed like it thought to be. I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,A pretty good guide,I read the W.I.T.C.H.: Friends book and I thought it was pretty good. It wasn't the greatest guide ever but it wasn't bad. This book tells you about how to keep and help out your friends. It has advice from all the W.I.T.C.H. girls and there are cute little quizzes too. One of the things I like about one quiz is that it has results for people who picked a mixture of things. This was a great friendship helping book.
4,"Funny, Appropriate, Arrived in Good Condition","This collection has aged well. Buying it used was not a problem. The book arrived in decent shape, especially given how I'll try to get my teenage kids to read it. I found the early Bolling material to be as funny as I remembered. It's insightful, too, a welcome edition to our light reading shelves."
4,Le Morte D'Arthur,"I liked this book very much. I think that if anyone is interested in the story of arthur and his knights should pick up this copy. This copy tells of betrayel, romance, chivalry and is probably one of the best interpretations to the original form of the story. If you want a quick reading book and do not want to read all of the literature that Thomas Malory wrote then pick up this. However the original is still the best."
3,"good, if your studying the subject","yes, this was good, but very dry and wordy. If you wanted to understand it better, you might want to look up on the language of the day. the thing I didn't understand was Arthur being an emporer of Rome. how the heck did that happen? This book, I think, is better used as a learning tool than ""light reading"":)"
