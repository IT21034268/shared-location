5,Nice follow-up,"I first heard TRUSTcompany on my XM hearing ""Falling Apart"" from the first CD ""Lonely Position of Neutral""... I quickly fell in love with it. Like many I anticipated the release of ""True Parallels"" after hearing the first sample of it(""Surfacing"") on MVP Baseball 2004 I really wanted to hear more. When the CD came out I was suprised that I liked it more than the first. By far the best songs are ""The War is Over"", ""Slave"", and ""Retina"". It is a great CD and I encourage everyone to go and buy it. You certainly won't get tired of it!"
5,And they did it again,"I must say this is another album where I love EVERY single song. Unbelievable. I was blown away by their first album, and blown away again by this again. Buy this CD."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I am not writing this one star review to bash the band, but almost every review says if you liked the last album you will like this one. I loved the first album, but just can't get into this one at all. I've been listening to it for almost a month, and it just isn't doing it for me. The songs are much poppier, a lot less heavy, and very repetitive. Surprisingly, even though the songs seem poppier, they do not have the catchy hooks of the first album. None of these songs stand out, and I don't see myself listening to this album for years as I have done with their debut. All I can say is buy their debut (the Lonely Position of Neutral) but don't assume that you will like this one if you like the debut. I think they differ greatly, and not in a good way."
5,Great Album,"A lot like their first one...not a lot of variation between songs, but none of them are bad.1. Stronger - 8/102. The War Is Over - 10/103. Surfacing - 8/104. Slave - 8/105. Fold - 10/106. The Reflection - 7/107. Breaking Down - 8/108. Someone Like You - 6/109. Crossing the Line - 7/1010. Rock the Casbah - 9/1011. Silently - 6/1012. Erased - 7/1013. Without a Trace - 7/1041. Retina (hidden track) - 6/10"
3,not bad,"not too bad, singer gets a little monotonous after a couple songs. They jam out pretty good though, worth a listen for sure."
2,if you like trust company,"this album is good if you are a fan of the band or like ""stronger"". that being said every song sounds the same. they could have just wrote one 45 minute song and had better results, because then it would have at least been something epic. if you like the last album you'll like this one, but if not don't bother with it."
2,Worthy of 2 stars because theres only 2 good tracks.....,"ive listened to most of the cd and so far the only really good songs are Stronger and The War is Over. Wat happened? This is so much different from there first record which by the way is really good. I was a fan of these guys for awhile but I just got bored with them, and then I heard there finally coming out with a new cd so i said ok it might be good, but i was terribly wrong theres only 4 good songs on this cd. And it sounds like they are moving into the EMO category which I HATE WITH A PASSION. Well maybe there 3rd cd might be much better but until now stay away from this awful cd. Who knows maybe ill end up liking this cd within the month. If you want a good fresh new record check out LULLABIES TO PARALYZE by QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE which also came out today, and is a pretty damn good cd if I say so myself."
1,THIS IS A DEFINATE LAME ASS CD,"Okay I'll admit it trust companys first cd was a guilty pleasure. Now this cd is so lame, you can tell that their record company forced them to write music how they wanted it to sound(radio friendly) and that sucks. Come on TC get some balls and write some good music, i feel ripped off for buying this cd, HEY TRUST COMPANY CAN I HAVE MY 10 DOLLARS BACK!"
2,Not that great for the disabled,"Pretty useless, actually: 1) the grips tend to stick either in the wide or narrow position: I have to fool around with the tiny tab at the handle end in order to put it in the correct position, 2) Very difficult to actually pick up things from the floor. Works better for gripping things from, e.g. high shelves.A much better gripper, especially for dressing yourself if you're disabled, is from Sammons Preston: It's the 26"" Reacher and costs $17.25. That's about the only one I use now. I'll reserve the Pik Stick when I'm walking again to snatch out-of-reach items..."
1,poorly shipped,The product came bent in half. It was poorly packed in small thin box. Now I have to waste my time and gas to repack and take to post office to return.
2,I am awkward enough already.,"I am disabled and needed assistance reaching items I dropped or were just out of reach. I had have been using an item produced by General Wire Spring Company. I needed an additional item to use in my craft area. Since this stick came in a shorter size, I though it would be handy. Well, handy it is not. The gripper portion is simply plastic with no rubber attached to aid in keeping items from sliding out of its hold. The handle is constructed awkwardly. The locking feature sticks all the time. The only reason I did not send it back was that it was just too much trouble."
3,grip isn't very strong,"Bought this for my husband who is paralyzed on one side. He still likes to tinker in the garage. We have a ceiling mounted heater in the garage. I thought this would be perfect for him to be able to grip the knob on the heater and turn on/off the heater himself from his wheelchair. The length is perfect but the grippers just aren't very strong. He can grab the knob but the part that grips feels like it's about to break when he twists the grabber to move the dial on the heater. It works, somewhat, but I'm sure it won't last very long."
3,Reacher Pik-Stick is flimsy,The handle that closes and then releases the grabbers is sticky - and doesn't release fully unless you jiggle it. It should immediately open when you relax your fingers.
3,The grabber,I recieve two of these products and upon arrival one was not working. I called the Co and they sent another out in three weeks. I hope it will last.
1,Flimsy,Not very strong. A shorter one has already broken off at the handle shaft connection picking up a can of food. The latch that locks the handle down digs right into my thumb joint. Very painful or someone with arthritis.
5,"48"" grabber","Absolutely the most wonderful grabbing tool I have ever owned. This unit is almost twice as long as regular grabbers and is much more sturdy than the rubber tipped junk grabbers you see everywhere. This device is well thought out, should last a good long time and is a wonderful relief for those of us stricken with arthritis."
4,good product and well made,"great product ,the best picker upper you can buy but it will stick closed sometimes"
1,Not enough grip,"I have several reachers, but this is the worst. The grip is especially poor. Most objects slip out of the jaws and the tips are too crude to pick up fine objects. The short length limits the reach for most practical purposes. Never again!"
3,Well made but Gopher a lot easier to use.,"This was way too long, the grabber locks when you use it. I prefer the Gopher II."
5,a true gem,truly ahead of his time. this man brings every bit of his humanity to all that he writes. his work in the world is so profound...there are not words. i use the word 'awesome' with all the wonder one can muster.
2,"Not worked for me but a good placebo, buy it for others.","It did not work for me , i tried it for two weeks continuosly but it is good placebo, did not lose the weight at all. While my exercise is constant, the rate before using and after using it, I did not see the effect, still giving 3 stars because of it's price is very good and I did not have any side effect.So if you are buying for others, don' tell that it is a good placebo although it claims to work effectively.I tried force factor after trying this, that seems to be working for me although force factor has side effects."
3,Great Movie But NOOOO Subtitles!!,"I saw this flick in a film class with English subtitles. I found it on Amazon advertising subtitles. However, there aren't any subtitles. (Okay, I guess if you speak Spanish or want it just for the macho bizarro visuals...personally I am pretty disappointed.)"
3,Mist Floor Lamp Fountain,"After I ordered this one, I found another place that sold these with a remote control device that allows you to change the light show and misting capability. This one is pretty basic."
4,the complete nutcracker,"As a previous reviewer said, the English Gigue is a hard-to-find song, and few people know of its existence. This is actually because it was the first thing that Tchaikovsky wrote (according to ballet lore), and the first thing that he threw out. That said, this is a good album. The Divertissements sound a tiny bit fast, but every orchestra has a different spin on it, and all-in-all, this was worth buying. Many Nutcracker albums out there are an embarrassment, so this is refreshing."
1,choke chains,do not feel as though I received what the picture shows. It advertises chains but you only get one. and it was not the size that I was needing.
2,Pretty Vacuous,"Just aural trash ... I'm a big Laswell fan, but this is a project that didn't work at all. There's no there there, and the playing is irritating."
3,Great But Hard to Find,I have a stash of these I purchased when they were clearanced at local stores. I cut these in quarters and use as replacements for the pillows with my Dove SkinVitalizer each morningDove SkinVitalizer Facial Cleansing Massager with 1 Massager and 6 Exfoliating PillowsThe Dove Pillows are hard to find as are these cloths BOTH which have been rising in price.
3,A Good buy,the instructions are good. However there needs to be more pictures as there are diagrams. still shots of players doing the actual drills would be helpfull
1,This book is awful!,"My organization purchased this book in hopes of finding some teambuilding exercises that could be used at a conference for 60 insurance claims professionals. What we found was A book filled with games and exercises designed for elementary school children or scouts on a camping trip. If we used any of these games/exercises, we would have had tomatoes thrown at us!"
4,a pretty good buy,I found many exercises in this book to be useful. Most of them require no props and can be adapted to any environment. I work with school and college students and have used the exercises in my workshops with good results. The games are categorised and presented very well.
2,Cheesy and Cheap,"Horrific graphics, terrible acting, and most importantly, outdated science (even at the time it was released).Watching the actors playing Hominini do the monkey shuffle and act like kids would do if you asked them to play chimpanzee was really irritating. Watching the weedy, pasty, supposed archaic humans gingerly trapse across their habitat (like beachgoers without shoes crossing a hot parking lot), made me hate this film.This film has neither scientific value or any value as entertainment."
3,Agri-Fab spreader,"I had a problem with the spreader and could not get any help. The company that shipped this item referred me to Agri-Fab and Agri-Fab did not help me. They referred me back to the shipper. I decided to make the repair myself. I also did not get an iformation sheet as to how to set the spreader for the different fertilizers that are available. I contacted them and no information was avable. Most other companys provide this information. If your suppliers cannot assist a customer with a problem with their product, than you should not deal with them. When I purchase an item from you I expect good service and I am not getting it. Dealing with some of your suppliers is not always pleasant. I have been doing business with you for a long time and I trust your company. Things like this make me hesitate to do business with you."
3,Just dont make things like they used too,"We purchased 3 of these units 3 years ago and just this past year started replacing wheel holders with our own version where we drilled a hole through the end of the bar and installed a stainless codder pin instead of a white cap. Also had to replace the piece in the bottom of the hopper to stainless, as well as the arm to hold the spreader upright were too weak and rust out way too fast but for 3 year old spreaders thats understandable. But the 2 we just received from our order in January, we had to do all of these repairs after the 2nd usage on these spreaders. I don't know if they started cutting corners on the materials or what but for the price of these spreaders at least certain parts that have direct contact with salt need to be made out of stainless steel. and the arm needs to be musch stronger so it does not bend and or break. I feel they are worth about $125.00 less than what they are asking unless thes items Are resloved properly."
3,Salt Spreader,"This spreader is flimsy and week. The plastic tub, wheels and spinner are good but the metal handle twists and bends. The salt does not flow nicely to the spinner and requires a stick to keep pushing salt to the opening. Calcium chloride does spread well. I put a maximum of 100# of salt in the spreader and with that weight to need to be very careful that you don't hit a bump or uneven walks because the handle twists and feels like it will break. I will be welding additional supports so we can safely use this spreader.Buy a better unit if you need to spread salt"
4,most famous poem of T.S. Eliot,"While T.S. Eliot's ""Love Song of J.Alfred Prufrock"" is what he is most famous for, ""The Four Quartets"" merit much to reckoned with. I remember the first time I read ""Burnt Norton"". I was crashing at a friend of a friend of mine's place at UC Berkeley. I wanted to learn how to be poetic, and ""Burnt Norton"" was great help with such a matter. It is one of my favorite poems."
4,"Great fun, very enjoyabe.","I read the first two books of the trilogy a long time ago and only recently got given this book as a present. Iyt was just as good as the first two. Maybe not too sreious, but great fun. I would really reccomend this trilogy."
4,"Great book, but not his only 1!","I got into Terry Pratchet a bit late, so i am catching up on his books. The Trucks/Diggers/Wings trilogy is good, but for a better read try one of his Discworld Trilogy, with titles such as The Fith Elephant and Jingo, and featuring characters such as Rincewind, Twoflower, Hrun the Barbarian, Sam Vimes and of course Death! His sometimes dry sense of humour was at first difficult to understand, but the footnotes at the end of the page made it all worthwhile."
5,Pratchet is a demi-god ;),For anyone who hasn't discovered Terry Pratchet - Go out and buy something (anything!) by him TODAY. Wings is a children's book but still worth reading. His other works are all best sellers in England - a must for all fans of wit. It pokes a finger in the eye of fantasy fiction whilst at the same time getting all cuddley with Tolkien. Amozon you have to get more books by this guy! Please go out get a Pratchet book (from a library if you have to!) and improve your life. Now excuse me I just read his latest book - which has left me bare footed again. Must get some stick on socks ;)
1,"BAD Recording, BAD CD","I bought it BRAND NEW, and hear the sound quality was not crystal clear as I would have wanted..... I will look for better sound recording CD now."
5,The exliration of Vivaldi,Listening to Vivaldi is an exercise in joy. He is a master of the violin concerto and that's all I have to say about that.
1,Garbage,Any Christian who cares about remaining a Christian would be better off avoiding this excrement.
4,A true patriarch,"Here's a great CD of one of the true fathers of Country Music; maybe not in the same vein as Jimmie or Hank, but this collection will knock your socks off. I dont care what anyone says....one listen to this library of material and you'll realize that this is where the Willie Nelson ""sound"" originated. No, Floyd doesn't have the nasal voice or the inability to stay on beat, but the sound and material is the foundation for everything Willie would make famous later. 24 numbers here, including the famous ""Drivin' Nails in my Coffin"". If you're into Faith & Tim Hill or Kenny G. Chesney, steer clear of this album....this is the real deal."
4,Overlooked treasure,"From the other reviews, I have learned more than 99.9% of people still alive care to know about Floyd Tillman. (Those Canadian winters are very cold I guess). Notably his songs were recorded by more mainstream artists also in the 1950s. (I hope he got his royalties.) One special song was ""I Almost Lost My Mind"" recorded by Ivory Joe Hunter and Pat Boone, just to name two. The orchestration on that song still resonates today. Floyd was a talent."
4,Images of the Journey,"The captions locate the illustrations in the flow of the narrative and relate them to the primary meaning of the action at the place depicted. The authors try to provided enough information and observation about the pictures so that a reader who knows the text, or reads along in an annotated translation, can easily get its point. The essays that are interspersed with the illustrations are intended to suggest how deeply the poem explores the stages of moral and spiritual development in images that are psychologically acute for people today."
3,Appears excellent EXCEPT FOR KINDLE USE,"This review won't be worth anything except to those who want to use it on Kindle. The book appears to be written in a straight-forward, easy-to-understand manner. The problem is that it doesn't work well for use on Kindle.Some of the letters within the text aren't representative of the Greek letters (an h for a lower case eta, for example). At the points where one is to read a paragraph of Greek text for practice, the text is very small and the letters are not clear. Increasing the Kindle text size only increases the size of the English text, not the representative Greek texts to be read for practice, so I found the Greek text to be unreadable.If you're considering purchasing this as a Kindle download, try the sample first to see whether it will be of use to you. I have the original Kindle; I have no idea if it will work better on the new one or on one of the smartphone apps."
2,Kindle version of this book,"While the content of this book may be great (I'm just starting with it this semester), the Kindle version has some issues. One major issue is that the breathing marks are hard to distinguish. The Kindle version must be using graphics for the Greek characters instead of a scalable font. This is a bit of a problem."
4,Very well done!,"This book is wonderful. Much easier to learn from than some of the others. The only drawback is that the index could be much better -- for example, in the lexicon entry for a verb, it should include the page # on which the verb is introduced.There are also some Greek words introduced in the text that are not included in the lexicon."
5,Excellant!,"Since I have never learned a foreign language before and have little knowledge of grammar, I was afraid Greek would be too hard for me. I find this book very easy to understand. The lessons are divided into small pieces with good explanations and small vocab lists."
2,Difficult read on a KINDLE,"Font issue. The regular instructional text will increase in size. But, the Greek charts and grammar will not. The Greek text I found to be barely readable in a lightish grey small font size. Too bad. Hopefully the editors will adjust the font for KINDLE users. In the meantime, I had to refund my purchase."
1,Have not read the book.,"I have not read this book nor would I waste my time. I would suggest that anyone who wants to learn about Hinduism or Siva, start with someone who was raised in the culture of Hinduism, not from a Jew from New York. Of course the title has to mention ""Erotic""...??? Just like all the phony books about Tantra that only has a small percentage to do with sex, but according to the phony fraud authors it is about nothing but sex. You'll find these type of authors writing about Buddhism and Taoism, etc., anything to make a buck. If you want to learn about Zen Buddhism for example, try a Japanese Zen Buddhist."
1,Misrepresentative,"This author may be a self-thought scholar and the western world annoited scholar on hinduisim however, she does not quite understand hinduisim correctly or represent it correctly."
4,Excellent Groove,"Very nice two session set from 1963. Big John Patton is definately on in these sessions check out the tune ""Big John."" Green is a little looser than normal and chimes in with great solo work as usual. Check out Green's improv on ""Look at That Girl."" Overall the set has a nice flow to it and digs a nice deep soul groove."
2,Do not buy this unless you have every other GG CD!,I have a lot of Grant Green recordings and this is the worst by far. Repetitive blues-jazz cliches. Excellent musicians that are just going through the motions. Get Grant's First Stand instead.
2,Poorly edited,"This book has many grammatical and spelling errors -- most egregiously, it consistently spells ""all right"" as one word -- ""alright."" Don't these people have editors, or at least a spell check?It's also not incredibly well-written. The writing is choppy and just kind of boring. If you want to read a zombie novel, you're much better off with Max Brooks' ""World War Z."""
1,Wouldn't recommend,"I have now read all three books in this trilogy by David Wellington. The story is ok and I would have given it a three if it stood alone as a zombie novel, however after reading the final book in the trilogy I was so disappointed in the ending I felt as though I had wasted my time in reading any of them. Therefore I decided to give this book only one star because ultimately I felt really deflated and disappointed."
3,Uber-zombies,While enjoying the book to some degree I don't like the Uber-zombie that has an internet mind-link to control other zombies. I also prefer human over animal zombies. It certainly is possible for a disease (or effect) to be limited to one species. I have read both of Wellington's zombie books and will probably read any others he writes but I won't keep them for my collection. I will resale them as I have already done with these.
3,Take the good with the bad,"This was definitely . . . different. He is a good writer, and there was a good story here, but somewhere along the way I just started rolling my eyes at certain points. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I read the book, but for me...**Sort of a spoiler**... when a 3000 year old mummy/dead man comes back to life and starts using modern phrases etc (""if you get my drift""...""cmon lad""....things like this), the whole immersion thing hits a light pole at 90 mph. There were a few other instances as well that didn't agree with me either, but overall, while not fantastic, it was worth reading."
4,"Very good read, despite the flaws","To start, I would definitely recommend this book to any fan of the 'zombie' genre that likes to see the traditional rules and memes broken or expanded. While many reviewers have compared the story to Romero...I personally didn't feel that by the end.I really love the author's new ideas and fresh take on what makes a zombie really is - it's quite a mix of realism and imaginative ideas.My biggest complaint is the rushed nature of the story. The ideas were so original I wished the author had spent a lot more time exploring them. From the VERY flawed protagonist and his motivations to the creation of the primary antagonist - there is SO much story there that was quickly passed by to advance the plot.I think the novel is officially 292 pages - I think either two book or a target of 500 pages would have been more appropriate to develop the characters and the world.I am DEFINITELY looking forward to reading the other books by David Wellington!"
3,Entertaining Kinda...,"This was tough to get into at first, but picked up the pace after a rambling beginning. The plot was rather interesting and spooky until it came to the freakin' mummies! That was just ridiculous. And there was other ridiculous stuff too - like the strange and unrealistic twist of an ending. But, I braved it all and was mostly entertained and amused. But, I don't see myself reading the sequels, especially if there are more ridiculous mummies popping up. Onto better zombie thrillers. Cheers!"
4,Liked it!,"Another zombie novel. Oh no. Actually, this one was very interesting. It's a different take on zombies. Fresh ideas.I really liked the first third of the book. Great ideas and an intriguing story and characters. The last two thirds were still good, but there were a couple parts I didn't enjoy as much. Overall this is a good book.If you are looking for a standard run of the mill zombie novel, then you won't like this book. Some of the zombies are different and there are even mummies. Yeah, it works, don't worry.Great book. Looking forward to reading Monster Nation and Monster Planet."
2,It's good for the genre...,"First off I'm not going to say anything that's going to give anything away about this book as that I loath about the average review. All I'm going to say is the first half of the book I LOVED and than it got a little out of hand, and then it got even MORE out of hand and totally ridiculous to the point where I could barely read it to the end. These last years I've been reading a lot of zombie genre so I've read some really great stuff but mostly terrible as that's on average what's available in my opinion, but I'm addicted, but I must say though Monster Island starts off a promising read it ends up falling under the category of mostly terrible. :/"
3,Kind of like a SyFy channel movie,I'm not sure who came up with the original ideas so I can't accuse anyone of not being original. But there wasn't anything new in this zombie tale. So I've either read the copycats before this - or this is one of them.
4,good read,"This is a good read, kept my interest in the story lineTwists and turns, would recommend to any andeveryone who enjoys zombie books."
4,Solid read,Above average zombie read. A different take on a well worn genre. Not usual virus gone wild story. Nice start to the series.
4,Zombies in New York,"If you enjoy the same old plots used in most if not all post-apocalyptic novels then Monster Island is not for you. This book injects new ideas into the tired zombie genre while still maintaining a little of what makes us love survival horror in the first place. I really enjoyed this book; especially getting to see the apocalypse through the eyes of one of the undead. I almost rooted for the bad guys! A lot of the plot elements I had never read in any other books, and although at times I felt as if certain themes were a little bit too far-fetched (even for a zombie novel) it was still refreshing to see where the story was going to lead. All in all, if you're looking for an unconventional take on zombies, Monster Island won't disappoint you."
3,Ambitious & Original,"You can never accuse Wellington of complacency in his takes on modern horror. He has now tackled zombies, werewolves, and vampires in his own original way. I am a big fan of traditional zombie fare so this book delivered mostly on that by describing a world that has been lost to the undead in a few short weeks. It is highly imaginative but lost me with a bit with a scheming Druid, revitalized mummies, an intelligent zombie, and assorted psychic powers thrown. However, the whole thing is a fun romp with girl soldiers from Africa and a U.N. weapons inspector on a quest for medicines in the United Nations headquarters. Wellington takes us an high energy spin through the post-apocalyptic streets of New York (which he seems to know well) and moves the genre in a different, fresh direction (albeit one that purists may have a hard time with)."
3,A Fun Fast Paced Book,"The book started off as a great zombie story.It got a little silly in the middle with mummies, Druids, and talking zombies.By force of will it overcame the silliness and became a really fun action tale at the end.I'll definitely finish the trilogy, but first I have some other books to read."
3,entertaining enough,"I enjoy a good zombie story. Be they curses, viruses or just horror with blurry originsThis novel starts out entertaining and creepy. Somewhere in the middle it gets sloppy, ridiculous and desperate to keep going (mummies? Mael? pigeons? Really???)By the final act ... you just get a hastily typed out trainwreck. The villains stop making sense, the established universe stops following its own reality as the writer plugs in random ""godmode!"" codes (not gonna spoil details, but read Jack's actions at his introduction, later in the metro and then compare to the utter stupidity of his final pages!!)Strangely enough, the final 2 pages make sense again. The ending totally fits yet leaves plenty of room to either walk away or write another novel.Don't waste your money on this book- borrow from a library or a friend. If you want good zombie lit to buy: try ""World War Z"" or ""Walking Dead"" comics instead"
5,Monster Island got me hooked on zombies,"I bought this book just because I thought the title was cool. I never knew that this one novel would lead into a major zombie addiction. The zombies here aren't mindless shambling corpses in the background -- they have goals, personalities, and ambitions. It's a zombie political thriller!After Monster Island, I tore through the whole series (Monster Nation, Monster Planet) and then started buying zombie novels other Amazon readers recommended. Not one of them can compete with the mind boggling originality and the plot twists in Wellington's three novels. Is there any other horror writer who can make you root for a zombie?So, if you're craving something different - get these books. Read them. And savor every page."
3,OK Story,"This started off interestingly, but as the story progressed, it got less and less believable. At first, this seemed like a story that was about a plague or pandemic with a medical basis. As it went on, more elements of supernatural mumbo jumbo were introduced, which really hurt the story. By the end, so much happens that is just so ludicrous that I couldn't take this seriously anymore.It was as if the author was trying to deliberately make more and more ridiculous scenarios, like saying ""ok, how about THIS? Still reading? Ok, then what about THIS!!??"" Really, it got beyond silly at times. Overall, this was fair - there were some entertaining sections and interesting concepts, but not enough to bring this above the mediocrity it wallows in."
4,Pulp Zombie,"Forgive me. I couldn't resist using ""Pulp Zombie"" in the title. I really enjoyed this book. This book won't be winning the Nobel prize in literature, but it was a really fun read!I really enjoyed how the author set up the U.N Weapons inspector to align himself with some really scary schoolgirl soldiers. Then mayhem ensues!I was very amused by Gary's the Zombie's perspective of events. I actually felt a little bad for him. Nice job Mr. Wellington!So, if you like reading about Zombies (and perhaps understanding their psyche) I recommend this book. After reading ""Monster Island"" and ""World War Z"" I could handle any type of zombie situation."
2,Didn't really care for it,"This book is kind of a mess. You have zombies, zombie animals, zombie birds, a thinking half-zombie, mummys, a celtic shaman, a U.N. weapons inspector, teen-aged Somalian girl warriors. At a certain point it is just kind of silly. Can't say that I liked it."
1,Did not enjoy this book!,"Umm, all I can say is that some people are easily pleased. I tried to enjoy this book but failed to reach the end, it just became way to irritating after awhile. It isn't in the least bit creepy nor does the plot make sense."
1,Please save your money for a real Zombie novel!!!,This book was the worst zombie book ever!!!!!Not even worth the review.
4,"Great concept, crumbles a little towards the end.","An entertaining take on zombie tales. Where he went with the story made it less of a horror book and more of an ""us vs. them"" or good guys vs. bad guys story, but the characters were kind of interesting and it kept the plot moving along. Worth the read. Also, google the books and you can find them for free online."
3,Almost really good...,"There was a lot to like in this novel and by the time I finished I was glad that I had read it. There are many unique takes on Zombies in this book from how they can be thwarted by surviving humans, to what they do when their food gets low (I disagree with one of the above reviewers, the thought of the dead eating bark because they have run out of other food sources was creepy).Where I got disappointed was there was some spelling mistakes throughout the book. Made me feel like there was no proof-reader. Some of the characters logic seemed flawed and sometimes they did stupid things that just didn't seem to fit with their characters.I do feel like this book is worth reading for horror fans though, it was definitely not just lifted from other Zombie movies/books and you could tell the author labored over it and I appreciated that. I have not decided if I will read the other books in the series yet, but I am not disappointed I read this book."
3,"not great, but not bad","Personally I like a little possible plausibility in my zombie reads. I'm not really into zombie fantasy. This book was more fantasy than plausibility from beginning to end. Now, having said that, the book was not bad, just not great. It is not scarey and will not give you the chills. Bottom line, this book is a pleasant read for zombie fans and does have a nice little suprise at the end."
2,"Okay, but there are better options out there","If you are looking for a straight-forward zombie book, this isn't the one for you. There were far too many supernatural powers employed, mind-reading mummies, etc. I prefer stories with virus-infected zombie masses, not mind-controlled zombie armies. It was okay for what it is, but I have no desire to read the other books in the series.If you prefer the classic kind of zombies, I'd recommend World War Z, Day By Day Armageddon, or one of the Morningstar Virus books instead."
1,Zombie novel or Night at the museum???,"This book felt more like, ""a night at the museum"", than a zombie book. It starts out great with real mystery surrounding the Gary character, then it unravels in such an absurd way that it becomes a mockery of the genre. i could care less about mummies, and if I had any idea that they were in this book, I wouldn't have bought it. The other 2 of the trilogy sound equally as absurd..."
2,Made me kinda sleepy.,"I am sorry to say I found this book to be a bit simplistic and lacking in descriptions and explanations. The writing style seemed amatuer and sometimes just seemed too repetitive. I have read far better and more in depth books on psychic abilities and would suggest you check around before purchasing this book. On the other hand, if all you want is an overview and some light reading this may be a good choice for you."
4,Easy to relate to!,"This series my Laura Peyton Roberts is so amazing! Although some issues may be a little too ""perfect"" the characters all resemble characteristics we possess! Whether its Jenna's undying love for Miguel, or Nicoles obsession w/weight... we can all relate on some level. I really recommend all teenagers to try this series out. The books are extremely entertaining and definitely light-reading."
2,Wheres the heart and soul?,"A clean-cut but sadly pretty-boring novel, featuring a bunch of teenagers that are hard to get attached to.The most exciting thing that happens is that one of the guys becomes a little infatuated with a girl when he discovers how beautiful she looks with a pumpkin on top of her head.Plus a girl named Leah wins a modelling competition.A boring one."
5,great lights,"Replacing my PIAA bulbs that keep burning out after about 6 months, I was very happy to find that these bulbs are equal in light color and brightness compared to the far more expensive PIAA bulbs."
5,Work well,"I installed these today and they appear to work well. For those who may be confused, please understand that these are standard lamps with a blue cover, so do not expect them to emit blue light (similar to a household type A ""cool blue"" bulb). I just needed new lamps for my headlights and have not had success with major brands(burn out in <1yr), especially the expensive ones, so I figured I'd give these a try. They appear to be relatively bright and have a claim on the box and page that they have a ten year warranty. The packaging was a simple box, not the plastic case in the picture, but that really does not matter too much."
1,Disappointed,I bought this thinking the light would be blue but it wasn't. The light was as white as any other light. I ended up sending it back. Amazon refunded my money and paid for the shipping both ways so I wasn't out anything.
4,A good book for young students,"This is the first book read to us by Mrs. Marion Congdon in 4th grade. She'd read one chapter every other day if our work was done. A good mystery novel full of intrigue, recommended for students in grade school."
4,Left an impression on a young boy,"I was probably between the ages of 9 & 12 when I read ""Johnny Bingo."" I remember the book well to this day. I can't say for sure if that's because of the story or because it was one of the 1st books (of that length) I'd ever read. I think the story's impact is just as relevant today as it was 30 years ago, at least for an impressionable child. My recollection of Norton Browning's writing style is that I couldn't put it down. :-)Story Summary: While at the bank with Mom, a boy is kidnapped by bank robbers. Eventually he learns he wasn't the only one snagged. Who is this other person and what's going to happen to them?"
4,Great CD,"I truly enjoy this cd. She really is a very tallented artist. My personal favorite is ""Everybodies Breaking Up""...Great song...Amazing voice. A little country, A little blues, very good."
3,One hit wonder,I thought there would be more songs as good as Black Velvet on this Best Of CD but did not find that to be the case.
3,My first Alannah Myles CD,"After hearing 'Black Velvet' on American Idol, I wanted to have the song from the original artist. I had never heard of Alannah before researching this song, her work is ok, I was not blown away by the other songs on the CD, perhaps they will grow on me. It at least taught me a lesson, if you can't listen to the other music by an artist before buying a CD, perhaps you would be better off buying just the 1 song you are interested in."
5,Great Music,"I have always loved the songs of Alannan Myles but never had a CD of her. Listening to one of my favorite radio stations one evening, i heard one of my favorite songs of hers. It was Black Velvet, and i knew right then and there, i had to order the CD. I have enjoyed it since then, you would also if your a fan of the great singer."
5,Very pleased with product and service,"I hate shopping and I'm trying to build up a CD collection that is representative of all the music genres and memories of the past. This is a great way to do it from the comfort of my living room, and the cost, even with shipping, is very competitive. Thanks..."
2,Cute but poor shape,"This was very cute and will be something for our daughter to wear with her dad when he is doing construction jobs. However, all of the rivets were extremely rusted over, I spent almost an hour trying to use rust remover on them. I don't know where it was stored or how wet it got, but something happened to it, and having to clean up a product before giving it as a gift is not my idea of fun. It would have been an excellent purchase had it not been so damaged. Good thing it's something she'll be wearing outside, but still wish it wouldn't have had that strange problem."
2,"Cute idea, but way too big for a child","We bought these for our daughters to help me build a play kitchen as their Christmas gift. The belt is so big that even when at tightest setting it was falling off their hips. We'll hope they fit in a few years, but disappointed that they may not be able to wear them until they are teens.Nice color and quality materials it is constructed out of though."
1,Too small,My daughter works with Habitat for Humanity. I got the tool belt for her. It is way too small. An item for a child. Nothing in the write up said it was for a child. Frog spit!
4,The Many Faces Of Eddie,"I don't know how he does this but Eddie Murphy has proven himself to be the consummate dual role + in this movie where he takes on not just 2 but 5 different characters both male and female. He has no equal in the 20th or 21st centuries and can be just as convincing as the cultured Professor Klump as the arrogant, self absorbed Buddy Love. Great viewing."
2,not to be taken seriously for a reason,"this movie sucked so bad. i mean i know that the original was hilarious and an extremely hard act to follow, but this movie hit an all time low and i'm certainly not happy with it. i expected so much more from eddie murphy who is usually funny, but delivers a horrible performance that not even janet jackson can save. janet does excellent while no one else in the entire movie can be said the same for. i can't believe that the critics gave this movie good reviews, because everyone that i talked to told me that this movie was terrible and i my self can tell you the same. don't waste your time or money."
2,"TERRIBLE, NOTHING LIKE 1","I was expecting a repeat of the first one. Nope. Bad jokes, boring plot and Buddy Love is just annoying. Im afraid this one hit an all time low. The only funny jokes come with Dean Richmond and Granny chasing down Buddy, thinking hes the stripper man. Otherwise a low blow."
3,Sequal was a let down.,"What a let down! The Movie Trailers actually showed the best parts, so once I saw the movie I was expecting more. Although the Fathers Retirement Dinner was funny, I found the table chat hard to follow as Eddie ad libbed so much. It was nothing like the first Movie."
2,"Interesting Concept, Horrible Movie","I can no longer remember the days when Eddie Murphy has made a funny movie. He is now involved in movies that will appeal to everyone and pad his wallet more than his reputation as a comedian. This film is no exception. The first film made a good anount of money, so someone had the bright idea to make a sequal. That was mistake number one. The second mistake was to take a scene that was funny from the original film, and make it into a feature length film. The scene with his entire family, which was Eddie on a huge ego trip, was taken out, and now has a very poorly written film surrounding it. Janet Jackson may have been a high point, that being that she could actually act a little, but the rest of the movie was displaying what can happen when a star gets too much power, and such a large ego, that it is impossible for the film studio to say no to him."
5,KLUMPTASTIC,"This is a kick*** movie. I do not know it got bad reviews. It was funny and it had a really good storyline. Eddy Murphy did a really good job playing the Klumps. It must have been really hard for him. Janet Jackson plyed his girl in the movie and she also did a good job. This movie is really funny, and in my opinion, it was alot better than the first one.It also has some bonus features on it too. It has Janet's Music Video: ""Doesn't Really Matter"", and it has a 10 minute review of the making of the movie. The bonus stuff is cool, but the movie is really good.If you like really funny movies, you will like this one, so check it out!"
2,Sequal bites the BIG one!,"This movie proves, once again, that the sequal never lives up to the original. The Klumps, trying to ride on the tails of its predecessor, attempts to give the one-dimensional Klump family a second dimension to their characters. FAILED! While the movie is very funny (why it got a second star in my opinion), it tried to take on a more serious family aspect which left the film dragging slowly to the next punch-line delivered by Eddie Murphy in any of his hilarious disguises. If you want a funny movie, I suggest going with the first Nutty Professor where the one-sided Klumps are more suited for their roles, though less present in the overall story line. If you're an avid fan of Grandma Klump and her ""Cletus-cutdowns,"" then this is your movie... though I could have done without seeing her making moves on Buddy Love. Enjoy your movie experience! :)"
3,Nutty...but it has its moments,"i was dreading seeing this movie, but in the event it wasn't so bad. I thought both Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson were very talented (Jackson's a LOT better than Madonna and just 'cos she was the pretty girl in the movie I don't see why everyone has to be catty about her) and the last scene was quite moving, but I thought sometimes it just went too far, i.e with the hamster, which was kinda stupid. But I don't think I'd bother seeing this movie again - at times it all got too dumb."
3,A Few Good Laughs,"The Nutty Proffesor 2: The Klumps, was a movie that could have been fabulous but stunk. The whole plot of the movie was pretty stupid and far fetched. The only parts of the movie that were funny were the parts when Buddy the dog was changed into the form of Eddie Murphy.Another part that could've been enjoyed was the part with the baby on the boardroom table. This part was ruined when it was put into coming attractions. But they have to show something funny there right?Despite the fact that the whole plot idea was dumb and far fetched, the movie still had a few good laughs. Watch the first movie instead if you are looking for a good story and lots of laughs. Wait! You may also want to watch this movie to see Janet Jackson.ENJOY!"
2,The same as the regular NP2,"I didn't see where it was different from the movie that was shown in the theatres. Except for a few lines that were in there. I didn't see a difference. Although, I would have given it a 5 because of Janet being in there, I couldn't do it. I still love the movie regardless, but I thought that since it was the director's cut, I would see a lot more that wasn't in there. This wasn't worth purchasing, I think if you have NP2 already, don't get this one cause it's the same thing. Only thing added were the videos for the movie."
3,Not Murphy's Best...,This comedy about a professor named Sherman Klumps in love with a beautiful girl who just happens to have an alter ego named Buddy Love whom he can't deal with wasn't very funny. I've seen much better Eddie Murphy movies such as Beverly Hills Cop but the plot is good. Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson are good actors that escalate the movie from a 2 to a 3 stars.Rent before you buy.
1,Please don't let your children watch this movie!,"My six year old nephew loves ""The Nutty Professor"" I would not let him get near ""N.P. II, The Klumps"" with a six foot pole! This movie thinks that dogs having intercourse is funny.....from the giant erection in the beginning of the movie to whatever the end was, it's certainly not for children. My extended family of adults sat down to watch this movie on Christmas night and one by one left the room until the rest of us just turned it off. Eddie Murphy is brilliant in his portrayal of the various characters but there are no redeeming family values in this movie. Just keep kids away!"
1,The Klumpinator is NOT Here,You know why he's not here? Because his whole stupid family is here. Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) wants to marry Janet Jackson and he has contracted a new formula. The Fountain of Youth. The movie is basically terrible and is about the family trying to be young again. All they do is go to buffets and start fires by farting into some cake candles. How rude. Eddie Murphy plays the whole family as he did in the first movie. Then Sherman used his 'powers' and sailed in a spaceship. This movie was horrible. Why don't they just eat some Tums or drink some Pepto Bismol. For crying out loud!
1,"Unfunny, vulgar excuse for comedy","If you think a fart is the appropriate punchline for most jokes, this movie might be for you. It makes Animal House look like upscale, sophisticated comedy. But the worst thing about this movie is not its non-stop, juvenile, toilet-oriented attempts at humor, but that fact that it is NOT FUNNY. It is just long and dumb. I finally got so bored that 3/4 of the way through it I rewound it and took it back to Blockbuster. This movie is not fit for adults or kids."
1,Absoluletly dreadful,"I went to the theater one night with my parents with a feeling of happiness, love, and hope.This was the star of Trading Places, Sauturday Night Live, and his great stand-up brought me tear-filled laughs. I left with a feeling of dread,hate, and I immidiatley wanted to watch Monty Python. This film was HORRIBLE! I hate it when people liked it! Sure, he did 9 roles, but can't he talk about something other than sex? It gets annoying after a hour and 50 minutes(which was how long the film was)If you like Eddie Murphy, Use your money wisely on Trading Places, not this garbage!"
2,Not even clost to the first one..,This movie was just awful...it wasn't funny at all. I loved the first sone but this was just not good. There was one or 2 funny moments but it was just basically to stupid.
4,"""Chunky Town""",Very funny. I think this is one of the funniest movies Eddie Murphy has made in some time (not counting Shrek). He plays almost his entire family in this film and is believable as each one. Great sequel!
4,Eddie at his best!,"One of his best works yet! He headlines a all-star cast as the Klumps. From Mamma Klump to the grandmother, it shows why he is the best actor ever. And it adds the beautiful Janet Jackson to take Jada Smith place in the movie. From beginning to end will have you rolling in your seats. Watch out for the part when the family are at the buffet resturant. If that doesn't show Eddie's talent, I dont know what will. Better than the first. Hope that it's not the last we see from him."
4,NUTTY IS AS FUNNY DOES,"This film, is very very funny, inever have seen the first one, so i fon't knoe if it is better or worse, very funny. PS:Not recommended to nauseaous audiences"
1,Buyer Beware! The author's friends wrote the reviews!,"I read the reviews and thought ""what the hell -- it sounds amusing."" But two chapters in, it became very apparent that I'd been conned. The book is dreadfully unfunny. Unless you think forging a medical note from a ""Dr. Randy Bumsore"" is hilarious, you'll be very annoyed with this book. No doubt the 5 star reviews are the work of his friends or the author himself. No wonder the book has a no-name publisher. I quickly returned the book, and I guarantee you will too. Buyer beware!"
5,"Excellent Film- great voice overs, and amazing stylized story-telling","This was a fantastic film. The information itself was very interesting, but the filmmakers put a spin on it, and in a completely unbiased way, the explain what happened at the convention and the trial using state-of-the-art animation techniques, moving pictures, archival footage, and great music. A must see for any baby-boomer, people interested in politics, and modern hippies."
4,Good Work,"Assembling doco, screenplay and cartoon, moviemakers present a story of anti-Vietnam war activities in the Chicago of the last century sixties, where justice won injustice years after the war.Pleasurable viewing on terms of presenting and music as Australian-produced DVD itself provides no extras/technical additions to a theatrical feature."
2,"Love the content, not the quality","Just like the other Scholastic DVD's that we have (Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, Chicka Chicka 123), this one has quality and/or editing problems. No visible scratches on DVD - it's brand new! - but the picture locks up frequently, and the words sometimes get stuck on one part of the story while the audio/picture move on to something else. Some parts have horizontal lines over the pictures. It's really frustrating to sit there and wait for the DVD player to move past the ""error"" and continue.That said, my daughter loves almost all of Mo Willem's creations, and was very excited to get these DVD's for Christmas. Cute ""extras"" at the beginning of the stories, as well as a nice little assortment of additional features. Since no one else mentioned problems, I'll try returning it and ordering a new one - and crossing my fingers that I just have a defective DVD this time."
5,LOVES IT!,"My grandaughter (6) loves the Elephant & Piggie and Pigeon books so when I saw this DVD set, I ordered it for Christmas. She LOVES it! Her Mom teaches Spanish and saw that the DVD included Spanish version and may use it for her students."
2,What happened to JP?,"One word - BORING - JP used to be the heavy metal of house, I could use this cd to fall asleep....."
4,Pre-review and a response.,"I have used other Foundation books and have found them to be more than adequete for my beginner/intermediate level needs. I trust that this book would do nothing less. I will most likely purchase this book. My ranking is based upon the other books.The real reason I composed this review was to let reviewer rayne353 from Texas know that ""usually ships within 24 hours"" means it ""usually"" leaves thier warehouse within 24 hrs of receiving confirmation that you purchased this book. The key word in that phrase is, you guessed it, ""usually."" It most likely left the warehouse 2 or 3 days after you purchased it. Don't hold it against them too much. I made the same mistake and I'm sure others will to."
1,I agree..please save your money,"I notice that two of the reviewers are from Birmingham, Alabama. That is interesting, to put it nicely, considering the fact that the ladies who made this program are also from Birmingham, Alabama. I cannot help but wonder if these people were asked to post positive comments about this product. I am not making any accusations. It is strictly my opinion. In reference to the video program itself, I agree with the first person to rate this product and that is to ""please save your money."" I truly wish this product could be recommended and I wish it were helpful, but unfortunately it is not. The idea is good, but the results were not. Please try to improve this product. Thank you."
5,Help for Teachers with Students with Aspergers,"As a second grade teacher with a student diagnosed with Aspergers, I found this video very helpful. Not only did it improve my interactions with this student, it helped me help my other students interact with him."
2,NOT for an LIS student,"ALthough this is text for an introductory course of management, this is inappropriate material for the novice or inexperienced potential manager. Recommended only for people familiar with business-speak and several years in the field of management."
3,SALEM WITCH TRIALS {BLU-RAY},I got this movie in October of 2011. This is a year later & this is the first time I've watched it since then. That tells you something right away. I got this for a good price {under $8.00} & the reviews didn't seem so bad so I took a chance. It's not a terrible movie but it's not that great either. You probably won't watch it a lot so think twice before ordering. The Blu-Ray wasn't great but wasn't all that bad either. Some parts looked like a dvd to me. I can't say too much about the audio as I listen through external speakers on an old stereo system. Nothing hi-tech. Sounds o.k. this way though. It's also in 1:78:1 aspect ratio which fills your screen. I know a lot of people like this format bit I'm not one of them . I prefer the 2:40:1 ratio so you see more of the actual movie. The three star rating is for everything combined. A so-so movie to me.
3,salem witch trials,I am big into History it was my favorite subject when i was in Schoolthe movie was pretty good. I enjoyed it and it got here real fast
3,Salem Witch Trials,This movie is interesting but overly dramatic. It will leave you with a better knowledge of the historic time that it presents.
1,Terrible Movie,"I was greatly disappointed in this movie! This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. While Kirstie Alley is an actress I usually enjoy, nearly everything about this movie was just terrible!"
4,What you say may come back to haunt you !,A good tale and not entirely accurate in it's presentation according to my family's recorded history. Claims of witchcraft fit right in with land and boundary disputes of the period. A closed mouth and keeping your comments to yourself still did not insured protection against accusations.I did enjoy the movie and Kristi Alley did a great job with her character. The young actress who played the main trouble maker and basis for all the Salem Village terror was the kind of character you love to hate. I found myself thinking that this psycho kid needed a good old fashioned spanking at the very start of the movie.It still amazes me that adults could fall for such a sham even to the point of accusing the wives of high officials. A village so wrapped up in ignorance and an unhealthy fear of God assured itself a black place in American history.
3,just ok,"Overlong, somewhat repetitive drama. With this much talent on the sheet it really should have been MUCH better. Actually it seems the less time the actors appear the better advantage they are shown. Rebecca De Mornay and especially Alan Bates acquit themselves well."
1,Historically Incorrect,"I watched this movie for all of five minutes. I purchased this title because I have a better than passing interest in and knowledge of the Salem Witch trials. One of my ancestors was hanged after confessing to witchcraft and another was on the jury that sentenced him to death by hanging. I'll guarantee that when he was accused of being a witch my ancestor's eyes did not develop a evil glow that afflicted his accusers. The accused witches that I saw in the short portion of the movie I watched all appeared (at least the special effects suggested) to be casting a malevolent spell. So much for historical accuracy. If you are in to Halloween special effects scary type movies, this is probably for you. If however, you are looking for dramatization that has a reasonable degree of historical accuracy, you best look elsewhere. Frankly, if I was an active witch, I would consider suing the authors of this piece for slander given their special effect misrepresentations of the accused."
2,Salem Witch Trials,"From a technical point of view it is a very well made movie. The story, if it is in any way accurate is sickening. All of those Puritans back then were insane, nuts, irrational, absolutely crazy. How did this nation of ours ever survive with lunatics like that breeding, spreading their poison and inhabiting this country? I'm sure had I been born in that time period they would have hanged me as soon as I emerged from the womb."
1,SALEM WITCH TRIALS BLAME IT ON LITTLE GIRLS,I thought the Catholic Church was good at diverting the blame for their crimes. Apparently the putitans run a close second. Were they so desperate they lacked firewood to keep warm that they burned people?
5,We're All Witches...,"SALEM WITCH TRIALS takes hyper-religiosity / pompous, self-righteousness, and mixes it w/ mass hysteria, paranoia, and ignorance. Toss in huge amounts of superstition and gossip, and you've got a lethal combination! This film shows quite vividly how religion, ANY religion, can never be used as a substitute for government. Like the Taliban today, the Salem Puritans utilized ""religious authority"" to enable them to destroy those they considered ""unclean"" or ""wicked"" (or simply didn't like), while calling their own homicidal insanity, ""the will of God"". SWT is an excellent portrayal of religion-gone-mad, using one of America's most shameful events as a template. This is a cautionary tale of historic horror. Though a dramatization about what occurred in the early 1690s, it's message certainly resonates in this or any other age. Watch and learn..."
4,A corner of the past brought to life,"Howard Berlin's book, The Coins and Banknotes of Palestine Under the British Mandate, 1927-1947, is the perfect reference for anyone interested in collecting this series. The Palestine Mandate period provided the prologue to all the current tensions of the Middle East, and the design of the coins and notes was done in such a way as to give all the communities living there an equal and unbiased monetary system. As an ""accidental"" collector of the coin series, I was particularly impressed to learn of the great rarity of some of the coins and in particular of the higher denomination banknotes. I definitely recommend this book to any serious collector."
1,Be very careful! Suggestion to everyone want water-based finish,"I bought the water based Polyurethane at homedepot. The problem I am going to say is not this product specific.I used water-based finish for several years. Truely the odor is fine while applying coats. Much better than oil-based.But please be extremely careful for the re-coating time. If you re-coating the finish in 2 hours as this product claimed you will have problem. The smell of the finish won't go off in several weeks/months. May be more longer.My suggestion is re-coating it when it's completely dry. One day or more under good condition(temperature, ventilation...). Even one week/month under bad condition.You need to wait enough time to make sure the VOC vapored. Please note this product still has about 250g/L(or 275g?) VOC. Some of them are harmful to children and pregnant woman.Water-based Polyurethane is a good choice, but keep in mind that it's only good if you properly use it. Otherwise, it could be worse than oil-based."
1,Very Disappointed - Seller Needs to Upgrade Product Description,"Since the seller doesn't offer a detailed written description of the product , I thought the picture defined what I was ordering- which is a quart of semi-gloss. But oh, no. I received a HALF-PINT of GLOSS, instead. A half-pint isn't enough for my project. And I didn't want full gloss at all. So I checked the measurements listed and the seller says the product is 4"" X 4"". NO! It's 3"" tall!!I'm sorry that I paid almost $14 for a half-pint of a finish that I don't want. It doesn't pay to return it.My advice is to buy a product from a seller who has a good, detailed description of what's being sold. Or you could email this seller to request more details but customers shouldn't have to go to the trouble of asking for basic product information; it should be made available up front.Buyer beware!"
5,Great for covering & protecting polymer clay items,"After using other polyurethane products that peeled off my polymer clay jewelry, I thankfully found out about this product recommended by some expert polymer clay artists. So far so good regarding my jewelry. Also, I really appreciate being able to buy the small can. Only store in my area that sells this, sells it in 1 gallon cans only (way too much for my needs!)."
5,Concerned about semi-gloss? Pay more attention to the listing.,"I've been using this product for well over a year now, and it dries crystal clear. It's unbelievably strong and will endure the constant abuse of my car keys without a scratch. Also, I've sent off a number of sculpted projects coated in this finish through various commissions, and not a single review has come back negative. So basically, I worship Varathane. It surprised me when someone mentioned their concerns about a ""semi-gloss"" rumor that was circling around the negative comments...anddd there's a drop-down menu on the listing. You can choose gloss, satin, or semi-gloss as a finish. And well, if you choose gloss, I would say this is most definitely the best glaze you can use for polymer clay!"
5,What wonderful music!,"Okay, full disclosure: I have never heard these CDs. I bought the original 3-LP album when it was released in 1984, and listened to it to death. When I bought my first CD player the following year and saw soon after that Chandos released these on CD, I was pissed. I think that sort of thing happened a lot back then to classical collectors. Well, I never bought the CDs, as the vinyl sounded so lovely. It still does. I am listening to the LPs as I type (they are almost noiseless). They are an old favorite for sure. I might transfer these for my iPod at some point, but I think I'll skip the CDs. But for those who don't know this music or these recordings, I would definitely recommend the CDs over the downloads. These undoubtably need uncompressed sound to be fully appreciated."
4,These Guys are Close To The Best!,"I bought this CD based on some of the other rave reviews. At first I kept comparing the singers to other superb groups like Ian and Sylvia, The Kingston Trio, The Limeliters, The Weavers, and Peter Paul & Mary. But, finally during one listening session with this CD, I was able to forget about these other groups so as to be able to enjoy these guys on their own terms as musicians and singers. And, I had to admit, ""yes, they are very good."" Get this CD for great guitar playing and the beautiful voices. I enjoy listening to this CD and you will also! Email address is gourmet72141@yahoo.co"
5,Bud and Travis,Travis is in my life a bright ray of sunshine..many hours and memories spent at the iron mask singing along with him are etched in corridor of my mind..as we once agreed..he and I..memories are good for raining days and long drives.We are all proud of you Travis.Tucon's son
3,Primarily meant for those learning English,"This well-structured and nicely illustrated English/Spanish dictionary is a good resource which could easily have been made excellent. Where it comes up short is the lack of bilingual coverage for many entries.Though the product description does flag the fact that the dictionary's purpose is to ""meet the needs of today's English language learners,"" the layout of the dictionary gives the impression that it is for English speakers learning Spanish as the initial entries are given in English. However, many examples -- most notably the practice exercises -- are given in English only. This could prove frustrating for those wanting learn or expand their Spanish with it or vice versa."
3,great service and great product,The Oxford Picture Dictionary: English-Spanish Edition (Purchased on 11/17/2008)by Norma ShapiroThe Oxford Picture Dictionary is a great product for learning Spanish or English.The order was sent quickly and professionaly.Thank you!
5,Very helpful book when learning english,"Very helpful book when learning english, my wife has been using it as well and is good to support our english classes"
5,The Oxford Picture English/Spanish Dictionary,"Wonderful English/Spanish Dictionary, my son really enjoys looking through the book and learning new words."
1,An Audio Picture Dictionary?,"I borrowed this dictionary from the library, thinking it was a CD-ROM since the title obviously said ""Picture Dictionary."" But when I popped it into my CD-ROM drive, I learned that it was audio only. Doesn't an audio picture dictionary defeat the ""picture"" aspect of said dictionary? The dictionary itself may be useful, but the fact that this is an audio version--rather than an interactive/CD-ROM/visual-inclusive version--is beyond absurd. Also, there is no way to look up specific words in the audio version of the dictionary."
2,wrong dictionary,"This Dictionary is to be used, by school teaching Inglish Than for average people.so I don't recomended for use at home."
3,STUDENTS DON'T LIKE AS WELL AS MONOLINGUAL,"I thought it was a good idea, but the student who asked me to order it for her, didn't like the transations in Spanish. She thought they were often misleading."
3,For Spanish speaking students learning English,"I am an English speaker trying to learn Spanish. This book is more for Spanish speakers who are learning English. In the index, the English words are given pronunciations, not the Spanish. The example sentences and questions are in English, they would be more useful in Spanish. It is a nice book, but not what I wanted."
4,"Excellent ""activities of daily living"" Spanish","Apr 5, 2008: Has all sorts of practical vocabulary for everyday situations: household vocabulary, garden care vocabulary, medical vocabulary and many other situations. Would be valuable to communicate with Spanish speaking employees who may have limited literacy, because it is a picture book aimed at adult immigrants. Has lots of words for tools, car repair and furniture that you don't get in high school textbooks."
2,It's OK I guess,"Having a vetinory background, I frankly think that some of the so-called 'cures' are a bit dubious, but this book really helped when our flock came down with red-scruff mange last sprong, so I guess it falls somewhere between ""invaluable"" and ""childish scrawlings""."
4,Useful for serious goat breeders,It is a great reference. It is a must for any serious goat breeder. It fills a void in the health care information about goats.
5,this is a must have for those who love hard bop,"Reece does an excellent job on this album in showcasing himself as a top notch trumpet player. Along with Stanley Turrentine and Art Blakey, he plays beautifully. Too bad Reece does not have more of his work available in the United States."
2,Just okay,"This was a fairly easy read, but lacked an instructional model for follow through. This was more of an autobiographical depiction of what race and manhood means to Kevin."
1,and in other tupac news...kevin powell wrote another book,"he loves tupac....he has serious issues with Black Women....its a hard knock life....he was on the real world.....vibe magaizine...? Who is Kevin Powell?I've read many of his works, and this is the end of the road for me. My biggest issue with him, is that he lacks balance and if he couldgt past his hurt feelings/bruised ego long enough, I could give more credence to what he says. He's like the Gary Coleman of writing. Sure he makes some valid points, but I could do without the bitching. I'll give him this, he's a good editor. I enjoyed Step Into A World. (minus the introduction) Give me Greg Tate, Mark Anthony Neal, Todd Boyd anyday!!!!"
4,"NICE DISIGN, BAD PACKAGING","I BOUGHT THIS TO WALL MOUNT MY 40"" LCD. THIS UNIT IS OVERKILL FOR THE TV, BUT BETTER SAFE THEN SORRY,,, NICE DESIGN, EASY TO USE, BUT BAD PACKAGING. THE BOX WAS DESTROYED. THE MOUNTING PIECES ARE HEAVY, AND SHIFTED DURING TRANSIT, PUNCHING OUT ON 3 SIDES OF THE BOX. DELIVERY WAS QUICK ONLY 2 DAYS."
2,If you like formulaic house music...,"then this, here, is your bag. If, on the other hand, you like the funkier, soul-jazz side of Mr. Ayers...ain't much of that showin' up. Sounds like catwalk music, except for the Mathew Herbert and the PPP tracks, which are pretty nice. In fact, they've got enough heat to justify buying them alone on an mp3 site. Just don't bother with the rest."
1,Love this music.....but,I love this music and artist. I bought this because it was described as a cd. It is a cassette tape. I left this message with the seller but they gave no explanation. I would not have bought this as a cassette tape as I already have The original cassette that I purchased it from the artist Oman Ken.
3,"Fairly decent, but lacking greatness.","Tennstedt's Wagner has some nicely detailed and impressive moments, though overall, I don't find myself carried away or terribly satisfied by his interpretations. There happens to be another conductor whose orchestral Wagner (not complete operas) I cut my classical teeth on, and who to this day still stands for me as a giant when it comes to revealing this music in all its glory---Otto Klemperer, whom Tennstedt cannot quite match in terms of commanding strength and grandeur. Even in many of his quieter passages, Klemperer conveys a vision of epic breadth. And where climaxes build and pinnacle, there is a sweeping presence, a sense of immense power and weight. This, I feel, is the kind of music that absolutely needs Klemperer's more massive and majestic approach. His performances of various works by Wagner with the great Philharmonia Orchestra are readily available."
2,Minor League Wagner,"Despite having both superstar conductor and orchestra, this CD simply fails to excite. The performances are bland and the orchestral playing flat as a pancake. This reissue was made simply to make a few bucks for EMI. I can guarantee you will never see it in EMI's ""Great Recordings"" series. A good price but you can do so much better for the same money. The Szell recording is a perfect example."
5,Morocco-A Place in Time,A great travel film that is educational and entertaining! A great Xmas gift for those who love travel shows and movies.
3,Just an Observation,"""The Observation Deck"" is a cute boxed set from Naomi Epel for writers who suffer from writers block or other inspiration malfunctions.The set from Epel contains 50 cards meant to inspire thoughts, stories or other ways of thinking during the writing process. A little book is also included that contains techniques that have worked for other writers such as ""Eavesdrop"" a little trick apparently used by famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eudora Welty and many others. The book is more effective than the cards and I would like to see that thought continued in larger volume by Epel.This set is a nice handy tool to have at hand when doubting your worth as a writer. Grab it for inspiration but rely on your own observations."
5,The Observation Deck is An Excellent Tool For Wrtiers,"I've tried many different writing tools but The Observation Deck is the first that has kept me going well into my first novel. Each card has lots of wonderful, playful suggestions to help you think differently about your characters and open up new ideas.It's great to pull a card when you're stuck on your own but it's also an effective tool for groups. My writing group uses it for 20 minutes of free writing during our regular meetings. It's fun to all work from the same card and come up with so many different slants and stories.Even if you don't feel like writing, the book is filled with hundreds of inspiring anecdotes about the techniques and ideas of famous writers.I highly recommend it!"
5,Your Booker Prize is all in the cards,"These pretty cards are an excellent device to jump-start ideas when that sneaky writer's block comes up. Great for brainstorm sessions and getting ideas organized. This is a fun tool for those who love cards - playing cards, tarot decks, and affirmations. Creative minds will have a blast using this ""ingredient"" in their recipe of book writing!"
3,good,it is good but they should have add more of woody videos then it would be worth the money store ask for because they will ask for 20 or more
5,The Kids are laughing like Woody now!,"Spongebob has some competition now. It's nice to see the kids, both under 6, can recognize a classic when they see one. My 6 year old walks around the house saying...""Daddy, it's that Woodpecker again!"""
5,old school loving,this video brought back so many memories that i had to order two more to give to my sisters. woody woodpecker reminds me what it was like growing up with the best cartoons ever and makes u wish for the old school cartoons. love itThe Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection
4,this fool kicked off the west-east coast beef,"tim dog the unsung hero in the west coast east coast beef set it off on this song this is one of tnhe best diss songs ever on the album he dissdes nwa, mc eiht, and dj quik I also loved how dre, snoop, eiht, and quik retaliated on him also cool jam."
2,Not Convinced,"I was not convinced of anything after reading this book.. I kept waiting and waiting for something to grab me and keep me interested. This never happened as I finished the book I am still waiting!!! I myself was not pleased after reading and seeing on the internet and news about this book. I would not recommend this book, but that is my opinion."
2,Don't bother,"The first two or three chapters of this book are fairly interesting. After that, it all falls apart. One gets the sense very early on that the authors knew their evidence was very flimsy and they tried hard, way too hard, to sell it with a lot of repetition and gimmicky transitions from chapter to chapter. Anything interesting that you might find in this book is already published in all the articles hyping the book that you can find FOR FREE on the internet. Don't waste your money or your time. Very, very disappointing."
3,Thought Provoking,"Dare I say historical revisionism? Or does historical imply reality?Withought mysticism, what is left of christianity? Or for that matter any religion. The book did open some questions I have harbored since childhood. Did Christ resurect body and soul or just soul. If so, his mortal remains may verwell be in the tomb. I enjoyed reading the book but it left me with a sense that Mr. Cameron is setting us up for another movie extravaganza. Not a must read, but enjoyable."
5,Check The Sources,"From where I sit, Pellegrino's bonafides are far superior to his detractors. A ""Biblical Scholar"" who has studied only the Bible and through the lense of faith is no scholar. Pellegrino has more archeological knowledge in his little toenail than the sum of the staff at the Discovery Institute."
2,Fact or Truth?,"The findings presented in this book whets my intellectual appetite for more proof. it's like a report of Science and Religion engaged in a clash of spiritual debate. if nothing else, it raises eyebrows and draws our focus on the greatest historical and spiritual event known to humanity. Based on the presented facts, we decide whether or not to believe. Is perception based of sight, or faith? And when has fact, even scientific fact, ever dissolved truth? Even Flavius Josephus documented Jesus resurrection. The end of my book, ""CSI Gethsemane to Golgotha"" states, ""Jesus was gone."""
2,What do you do when your proof is shaky at best? Get a famous Hollyowood director to sign on!,"First off, this isn't really a book about the alleged Jesus Family Tomb. Rather, it's about the making of the Discovery Channel special. If that kind of ""behind the scenes"" stuff interests you, you will probably enjoy this book.I myself was rather disappointed with this book. I really wanted to see proof of a historical Jesus. Unfortunately the best the authors can come up with is the names on the tomb. Since the names ""Jesus,"" ""Joseph,"" and ""Mary"" were among the most common names at the time, that's not very compelling proof. Even the so-called ""stastical analysis"" presented is not very convincing. I felt like they brought director James Cameron aboard to lend some credibility to this project, knowing that they could not present any convincing proof."
1,Disappointing,This book never should have been written. It is highly speculative. The implied conclusion is not supported.
1,bud sweat & tees is a better investment,dont waste your money on this one. fluffs video is a better buy but the shipnuck book is a good read. i read both within the last two weeks and have read way to many golf books and watched way to many videos. maybe eye surgery and lessons would be a better investment (like tommy). i agree the tips could be counted on one hand and you probably already know them if you score below 100. caddie stories could have been great and to rehash tom's pebble win in THE FIRST CHAPTER was a waste. i like tom as well as the next guy but this book was written to do one thing--make money! one of the few golf books that i would like to return if i could. usually you can get something out of golf books but not this one. take you $20 dollars and buy a few buckets at the range and always pick a target.
1,A good caddie but a bad writter...,"Michael Carrick is certainly a good caddie, but not a good writter. What makes him great as a caddie (calmness, keeping quiet, beeing 100% behind his player, Tom Kite), makes his book boring. No spicy details about the life on tour here. It is very obvious that Carrick did not want to upset anyone, starting from his boss, and the result is pretty boring reading. No funny anecdotes, no peek at what happens behind close doors... This is a book aimed at no one, I agree with the previous reviewer. Seasoned golfers won't get much help from Carrick's tips, they sound like 10 steps to break a 100. And if you are a beginer, my guess is that you will want to learn from a pro, not a caddie (try ""The element of Scoring, by Ray Floyd, to improve your game)"
4,Late-career tenor triumph,"Less than a year before his death in 1988, Al Cohn recorded this set with the Jazz Seven in London, England. The relatively anonymous sidemen prove themselves quite adequate in support of the senior sax master. With four additional horn players onboard (two saxes, trumpet/flugelhorn, and trombone), they provide arrangements that utilize the multiple horns effectively, yet showcase the guest star's cool bop tone, which actually seems deeper and more distinctive here in the twilight of his career. All the players get a chance to shine, with bass, drums, and piano getting their solo spots. Quite an enjoyable set of swinging bop."
5,EXCELLENT REFERENCE BOOK,PURCHASED FOR MY SON WHO IS JUST FINISHING VET SCHOOL. IT WILL BE A GOOD REFERENCE BOOK FOR HIM. I PURCHASED OTHER BOOK ALSO AND HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH THEM ALL.
2,Cheap and opens up sometimes,"We tried this product out for the first time with our robo hamsters, and at first it seemed to be going well. But then at different points, both of our balls opened up and we were shocked. Luckily, we were shadowing our hamsters the whole time and we grabbed the balls and closed them up before they even realized there was a gaping hole. If they had gotten out, it would've been next-to-impossible to catch them.We're probably going to have to use tape to seal it shut from now on, which sucks. Might not use it much anyway, but tape seems to be the best option to make it safe."
5,Hamster Toys,No Hamster alive doesnt want to roll around in this ball....it gives hours of excercise (not all at once though!) and its fun to watch the kids delight in his travels...
2,"This is my third ""Super Pet"" 7-inch ball.","I wish I could find a better quality product than this one. This is my third ball from Super Pet, and they all seem to suffer from fit issues. The lids are either very hard to get on, or they fall off unexpectedly. The clear plastic seems to be of the absolute poorest quality and bends and scratches easily. After a week or two of my hamster running around on the tile floor, you can no longer see through the plastic. He doesn't seem to mind as I think he can see through the small slots in the plastic (just big enough to let hamster poop fall out). I keep ordering this product not because it is a good product, but because it is a cheap product and I haven't found a better quality replacement as of yet. If anybody knows of a better one, please let me know."
3,Could be better,"My dwarf hamster loves running around in this ball. Instead of putting my hamster in a carrier during cage cleaning, I put her in her ball. I love that she can get extra exercise outside of her cage. When I got the ball, it came with a small bag of Kaytee Sample Food (not a treat which is what's in the photo), but I actually rather the sample food than the treat. Also, it already had a few scratches on the outside, but I think that happened during shipping (rubbing against other items). What I don't like about the ball is... that it scratches very easily, it gets hundreds of tiny scratches from rolling around so much making the plastic harder to see through & the lid... so far it stays closed while she's in it, but it doesn't close real tight so I make sure to watch her while she's in it. I wish they would make this ball more scratch resistant & make the door more tightly secured."
1,brittle and thin,"The price was great (four bucks,delivered), so I decided to try it. The ball arrived with one small crack in it. I figured it was too cheap to bother to return. We let our hamster use it. Within two sessions, there were multiple other cracks that were both dangerous to the hamsters feet and legs and potentially could lead to escape. There were no falls or major bumps that the ball took.Very disappointed. It has been thrown away and a replacement bought at Petco."
4,useful one,"Our hamster loved the ball. She runs in it and hits somewhere. If yours likes to hit around, you'd better close it with extra sticky tape because it feels like it will open."
2,Hamster ball with a crack on the lid..,"SO.. I know they sell it for really cheap.. But does that mean it reasonable to send something defective to customer? I found a crack on the lid when I open the box, and I just didn't bother to send it back (what if they said I crack it?) ANyways, despite the crack, you need to tape the tip to the ball because it's very loose. If you don't want to risk your rodent friend escape, you should secure it with tape. And.. it's more for bigger rodents like rat. My dward hamster, aka Fatty, is too small for it and he doesnt seem to like it :(And poops do fall out from the ball. One more thing.. the ball come with some sample treat.. it looks disgusting and has high sugar content. I wouldn't feed my hamster with that."
1,Animal Cruelty,"Run-About Exercise Balls are more than dangerous and considered animal abuse in many countries. if your hamster gets stuck somewhere while beeing in a ball like this, not beeing able to escape, the chances of it getting a heartattack are more than high. if it needs to pee it has no way to do so without weting itself. etc... for more reasons check out google^^if u love your hamster let him/her walk freely in an enclosed area."
3,cover hard to secure,"We are having a hard time securing the cover. This is our 3rd ball, so we know how they work, but this one is different. Our ""hammy"" has gotten out a few times as the cover came off while rolling or bumping into a wall. The ball itself is nice and clear and the slats keep ""potty stuff"" in the ball instead of out on our floor. Maybe it is operator error, but all 3 of us have a hard time."
1,not happy,The hamster ball I received looks like it's already been used with huge scrapes and scratches all over it will not be purchasing another one thru here.
2,Hamster Ball,"Got very dirty very fast. Very cheaply made, but I guess you can't expect too much on these types of things."
2,ball needs work,"This ball does not close on it's own so we need to tape it shut whenever we use it. It rolls fine, and our mice seems to enjoy it. Just not made well."
3,Okay if you like your products scratched,"I bought this because it was really cheap and a good deal, however when I received it, it was scuffed and scratched. Kind of bummed out about that, but it was cheap so what do you expect. Hopefully the new hamster wont mind lol..i guess we'll find out when and if he starts bumping into walls"
3,The lizards like running around in it,Our blue tongue lizards like running around the house in this ball it keeps them safe and does not let them hide in all the small cracks(under the couch) yet they get to roam free and get some exercise
1,Black Metal Money Clip Wallet - Not worthy of carrying your hard earned money,"I've used this wallet for 3 days and it already has begun cracking at the fold, and the flimsly stitching is falling apart. I get it that this was cheap, but this goes far beyond ""you get what you pay for."" The product is worthless. The leather is of very poor quality, not flexible and hence prone to cracking, and extremely hard. The ""Fine cowhide leather"" descriptor is very misleading. This is my first negative review of an Amazon purchase, but I wanted to save folks from making the same mistake I did. Avoid it."
5,A love story filled with surprises!,"The Ryan Brides is a wonderfully told story about three sisters and their, sometimes unwilling, quest for love. Karen, Julieand Katie are three brilliant, career-minded women who will inspire you with their love for each other and devotion to their family. With all the outward markings of a typical romance, The Ryan Brides has a few surprising twists, turning a simple love story into anything but. It will immediately pull you in, captivating and entertaining you.Another terrific aspect of this story is that we get to glimpse past the ""happily ever after"" scenario to see how their livesevolve and how they face the challenges of their future. That is what makes it so realistic and that is also one of the earmarks of a Pamela Waller romance. It's not your cookie cutter love-story. Instead, it will keep you enthralled until thelast page is turned!"
5,The Story Of The Famous Song - Animated,"Coverbox exactly as pictured. This is the story of the song Silent Night and how it was born. This animated tale takes you into a tiny, snow-covered village where the people learn valuable lessons and are reminded in a mystical way, the true meaning of Christmas. It is a holiday present for kids of all ages. Running time approximately 30 minutes."
2,It's laughable,"I got this video seven years ago and never ""Boxarated"" in my life and you can't take it seriously either. Andrew is basically the instructor and he's too busy flirting with girls that you lose interest quick. So don't bother buying it save your money you'll thank me for it...LOL."
3,Not what they used to be,"LaCrosse is one of those unfortunate companies which moved their production to China, and the change has done them no good. These 12"" pac boots are quite warm and roomy, but beware: They are made out of a rubber compounded in China, and like so many Chinese rubber products, they stink. And keep on stinking, week after week. Outgassing, I think the chemical industry calls it. If you are at all sensitive to chemicals in the air, these will cause you no end of discomfort. Sad to see an old line American boot company go downhill so fast, just to save a buck."
5,ANOTHER TOP NOTCH COMPILATION OF SONGS,"You need to add this one to your collection. There are 22 cuts. I like their version of ""I Have Returned"", ""Jesus Saves"" & ""Go Rest High on That Mt.""More than 70 minutes of heart wrenching excitement!"
1,Piece of junk,It is a piece of Junk. It broke the very first time I used it. I would not recommend it to anyone.
3,Okay,"Works okay, dough gets stuck in it, the arm does not get it all when you squeeze the handle. And sometimes and the handle gets stuck on the gear that it slides on."
3,Good Information if you're a beginner to the topic......,"This book is very easy to read and provides some excellent general advice and information for readers who are unfamiliar with the topic.However, it does not provide the detailed information needed by someone who wants to formulate their own tailored estate and/or asset protection plan even though the book implies that it does. For example, some of the 'information' relating the differences between states is outdated and/or wrong.Read this book for fundamental information and as a wake up call for the need for protection rather than as detailed advice on how you can do it!"
4,Good Book,This book provides a good look at church today and what we doing today to prepare for the future church.
2,The Present Future,"We were looking for a more comprehensive statement on change in church. This is from a very conservative, mega-church view. It has some valid points but it is not very positive and we think realistic about what is really happening in the mainline denominations. Service is the key and radical hospitality. Not what this author is advocating. Unless you are deeply committed to and serving in a mainline church, you cannot know what is being offered in the Lord's name. We should have read between the lines and noted the background of the author. The blurb about the book sounded like where we were headed but getting into the depth of the book showed us that we are on a different path."
5,Necessary Book for the Openminded Evangelical,"I, an unemotional type, was brought to tears repeatedly by the truth emmenating from this book. This book shatters old concepts of the church as a club. It challenges the judgmental orientation typically associated with the ""church"". I am going to use this as a roadmap in my evangelical work."
4,Insightful polemic on the institutional church . . .,"If you are follower of Jesus Christ but disillusioned by the institutional church (not excluding evangelical churches), McNeal's book is for you. McNeal says ""I am writing this book as a polemical volume. I want to galvanize church leaders to action before it's too late."" He then challenges the assumptions made in the current ""church culture"" which are usually much more about ""how to make the church better"" instead of how to help advance the cause of Christ in the world. McNeal uses words like ""missional effectiveness"" and ""apostolic leadership."" If you feel like something is missing in your church (even a Bible-teaching, believing church) don't miss this book."
2,First episode of the second season.,"This episode's story and acting is better than the rating that I give here. The reason for the low rating is that the show's overall feel and atmosphere has changed dramatically from the first season. The music, camera angles, and direction are more standard '50s science fiction and that makes this and other shows of the second season much more pedestrian. This show's story is good; it's about a soldier that's been transported from the future to the present and he knows only violence, so he tries to adjust. In the right hands, this could have been much better."
4,"Dog, dog, dog ...","Most Outer Limits in my opinion cannot hold a candle to the majority of the Twilight Zones. This is a rarity. Featuring, what will be a Klingon on Star Trek we have some very good performances. If it weren't for the fact that the ""Soldier"" was brought home this ep. would be 5 stars ... the ep. falls apart when the kids come in contact with him. Although I have this on laserdisc, I would buy it in a heartbeat on dvd ... wink, wink, nudge, nudge."
2,"Low rent alien dirge, about what you'd expect","51, or Area 51, or whatever you want to call it, is another Sci-Fi Channel co-production (like the cringe-worthy Scream of the Banshee) with this year's After Dark lineup. With that all in mind, you probably already know what you're getting here. Directed by Jason Connery (son of Sean) and featuring genre stalwarts like Bruce Boxleitner, Jason London, Rachel Miner, and John Shea all slumming it here as the fabled military base succumbs to an attack by the aliens they've been keeping prisoner for years, 51 delivers the goods for those looking for low-quality shocks and splatters. It really is better than the sum of its parts however, even with the overly weak acting and occasional unintentional hilarity that arises during some of the action sequences. All in all, 51 isn't the worst flick of this type you'll come across, and that has to count for something I guess in the end."
1,trying to be several movies and failing at all of them,"Too bad the cast was wasted here, because this movie is trying very hard to be Alien, Hangar 18, and who knows what else...and failing miserably at all of them. Cheesy, cheap, dull, illogical, and more."
2,Disappointment...,"For those considering buying this, I give you fair warning. This is the same Area 51 that was already shown on The SyFy (formerly Sci-Fi) Channel. If you've ever seen any of the original films they broadcast... well... draw your own conclusion. I almost picked this one up, as I have enjoyed plenty of the After Dark offerings. Luckily, I checked out the stills that go along with the listing, and realized what movie it really was."
3,"A partly delightful disk with 22 tracks, not 9!","About half of these songs are delightful; the rest I found to be forgettable. I am mad at Amazon however because this disk has 22 tracks, not 9 as they show. I almost didn't buy it because I thought it had only 9 tracks! Come on Amazon!"
5,"talisman-rockport, ma.01966","Hi there! For those of you who love my deck, we have our 1st draft of the accompanying book..Thanks for all your good wishes and thanks for the lovely reviews louisa poole talisman shop rockport, ma. 10966"
4,Good Compilation of Historic Photos,"And that's how I would sum up this book... a good compilation of historic photos. The title indicates the book is a ""photographic history"" so I wasn't too disappointed to see a gazillion old, black & white photos with simple captions. Personally I would have liked to see more information in many of the captions in the way of car models and years for every photo in the book. The quality of the photos seems to be lacking, and I'm guessing it's because a cheaper printing process was probably used. But in my opinion, the sheer volume of photos helps make up for what this book lacks in print quality and information. I'm glad I bought it."
3,Enjoyed the book but found it incomplete.,"The book contains a nice collection of photos from various time periods. I was very puzzled and frustraited that one of the last chapters entitled ""1970's to Present"" was missing important information. This chapter contained approx. 57 consecutive pages of police car photos that lacked the vehicle model year information. All of the previous chapter pictures included model year data. I hope the publisher will include this important missing reference information in the next printing."
4,"Lots and Lots of Pictures, limited information about them.","If you're looking for graphical reference material about police cars this is the book to get. However, don't expect to get much more than one line of captioning about them. This is a photographic history book, there is no text about engine types or anything along that line. If you want information of that sort, you'll have to dig up a tech manual. If you want to look at more than 800 different photos of police cars, this is what you want. The biggest disappointment is that there are no color photos, it's 100% black and white."
5,Must have for Jazz players,This is a great and accurate book that any serious Jazz player and student needs to have.
5,OUTSTANDING music book NEW REAL BOOK,"My son had to prepare a series of audition pieces in order to audition for Temple University. Their suggestion was a specific jazz piece, with which neither he nor I were familiar. They suggested he buy this book, but from the publisher themselves. We went to their website, got to the right edition, and the stupid site wouldn't let us check out!!! In frustration, we turned to Amazon.com. What a relief! Not only was it in stock and available, it was SO MUCH less expensive! It arrived in 3 days with no shipping fee and was in perfect condition! Now, if only the audition goes so smoothly...."
5,The New Real Book,"The book is well written and clearly presented.This is a new version, so it includes some pop songs, other than all the jazz standards.That's exactly what I needed and that's it.It just took over two weeks to be delivered.."
3,"Not thrilled with this, as a guitarist","This was recommended to me by jazz guitarists, and while it certainly is clear and accurate as far as I've explored it, I wasn't thrilled with more than half the songs here. Also, while most advanced jazz guitarists play easily in any key, far up the neck, more intermediate guitarists might not be thrilled with how many of the songs are in E-flat, a terrific key for piano but an unpleasant key for guitar, precluding any open-position arranging. I may have unconsciously assumed the ""in C"" note in the title was referring to how they'd offer up the music (I can transpose from C/Am to any other guitar-friendly key on the fly). I'll probably photocopy three to five songs from it, then give this away to my local library. I'll stick hereafter to using various free sites on-line that allow me to select from a wider range of songs that I like, often allowing one-click transposing as well."
2,"Get The Dwarf, Barabbus or The Sybil instead","A disappointing, meandering somewhat pointless fable. There are others he wrote far more worthwhile."
1,Dial indication is out of alignment.,I have to return this watch because the dial indication is out of alignment. Bad experience buying Victorinox Swiss Army.
5,A Classic,"I grew up with this album. I thought albums like this would continue to be made over the years but it became clear over time that this album was unique. When this album rolls (Mano Caliente, Esto es el guaguanco)you cannot sit still even today. His boleros (ballads) made me cry at age 13. Other tunes were deliciously sung in Cheo's cool knowing style (Pa que fin que).Cheo at his best."
2,"Too dry, too weird","This was a quick and easy read in the car on the way to Florida. Unfortunately, I found more humor in watching people weaving in and out of traffic. If there is humor here, it is far too dry and too Intellectual for my enjoyment."
1,The only funny part of this book is the table of contents,"I am amazed people find this book funny. Well crafted, and an excellent mimic of the styles of legalese, Boswell, et. al. But funny - no. It is a veritable ""potemkin village"" of a humor book, like Mad Magazine written by a bunch of engineers who don't know when to stop but who must carry something to its logical extreme. (I'm an engineer myself). Had there not been reviews from other Amazon.com customers, I would have said the dust jacket reviewers never read the book"
1,Lame,"It is an insult to the history of satire in this great land of ours to call this contrived waste of badly needed carbon dioxide sucking trees ""great American satire."" You know comedy is bad when you start to imagine the writer sitting in a plastic wicker lawn chair saying to himself in between slurps of some foofoo drink, under the drone of the neigbor's lawn mower, ""yeah ... heh, heh, heh, that's funny I ought to write that down."" If you want some satire from a disenfranchised white male, go check out T.C. Boyle's Budding Prospects and lets have the author of this dud out there planting the trees his book wasted.John Boyt, Uskudar American Academy, Istanbu"
1,I found it boring. Read parts of it before you buy it!,"The only good essay in this book is the title story. The rest are either boring or understandable by people with backgrounds a lot different from mine. Frankly, I didn't ""get"" the point (humor) in many of the stories. I suggest you read a few of these essays before you buy the book"
4,Monty Python meets Warner Brothers,"If you grew up appreciating Roadrunner cartoons, the title ""essay"" is one of the funniest pieces ever written; absolutely perfect word pictures of Coyote's mishaps, while defly skewering our litigious society. Although the book is uneven, don't miss ""In the Plain Air"" - all is not beauty among the Impressionist painters - and ""Boswell's Life of Don Johnson"" - Frazier's ear for parody is marvelous"
2,Tremendously overrated,"Quite an irritating book. 22 essays, each containing only a single comic idea streeeeeeeeetched to fill even a few pages. I wasted $20 to get this when it first came out, thanks to all the overblown hype. Reviewers had the chutzpah to say this guy's as good as Woody Allen! Not a chance. Go read ""Without Feathers"" instead. Now THAT'S comedy."
3,"Kind of sad, really","I first encountered Ian Frazier through ""Dating Your Mom,"" which is one of the funniest books I've ever read. Then I read ""Great Plains"" and ""Family,"" both of which are excellent but rather melancholy books. I don't know if it's me or him, but reading ""Coyote vs. Acme"" I couldn't help thinking that Frazier wasn't really laughing most of the time, so I wasn't laughing much either. The title story and a couple of others were pretty funny, but I would recommend ""Dating Your Mom"" for more laughs and his other books to correct your overly optimistic view of human nature."
2,One funny essay does not a book make,"As much as I have loved Frazier's other writing, this is a complete hodgepodge of unrelated essays that make no sense. Yes, the title piece is wonderful, but the others (all of them) are throwaways, the point of which in every case is almost impossible to discern, and are not funny in the least (no, not even a chuckle). Random, scotch-taped together claptrap. Don't waste your money. (My second star is only b/c of the title piece.)"
5,Not for everybody,"This book is not for everybody. If you have an above average IQ and executive ability to read between lines, you will learn a lot. About REAL dynamics of society, about world of high-profile players and politicians... the truth is striking. And most important of all - little (if anything) has changed since this book was written."
5,Great Oil Drizzler,"I echo the previous reviews. I also was afraid the oil dispenser in this bottle would pour too fast, but it really does drizzle! Balsalmic Vinegar for Table: It is fairly large for table use and pours a little faster than I would like-but pours 100% better than the bottles the basalmic vinegar comes in from the store."
2,Disappointing,"I have been really disappointed when trying to clean my Mannington hardwood floors. I spent a lot of money trying to find something that worked until I found out about their own cleaning product. It does the best job, but I still have a bit of streaking and it is really expensive. If I had known how much more difficult it would be to clean these floors, I would have purchased a different brand."
1,Great performance and recording but why such a poor transfer?,"This is the remaster by RVG, 24 bit transfer reissue produced by Michael Cuscuna I have been comparing to my friend's 1987 transfer by Ron McMaster also produced by Michael Cuscuna.Apart from the fact that the remaster is much louder and compressed, I was staggered at the difference. Stanley Turrentine's sax is so important to many tracks and drives the rhythm as much as the rhythm section itself but it has lost much of its exquisite contrasting soft/hard expressive qualities, almost like it's been added on top in the new version. Everyone seems to be playing in isolation and the drums are so much louder in the mix I can't believe this was all done with only a 2 track master, that is quite an achievement. Even the organ has lost much of it's ""watery"" quality. There's just no space left, most of the exquisite pauses are missing, dynamics and much of the texture are all gone. To make everything worse the noise floor even sounds way higher."
4,Sermon and Chicken Shack cd's are must haves,I purchased this cd because of my love for the Sermon. I was looking for traditional blues swing funk from the master where organ playing just doen't sound like organ playing if you know what I mean. With Turrentine taking charge on the sax this album is a funk delight and is played over and over only second to the Sermon. Burrell's licks are sweet and enhancing; this is great evening music to be shared with those you love.
5,Can I give this one 6 stars?,"This is Jimmy's best ever album.I'll say that again, this IS Jimmy's best ever album.It isn't ""over rated"".How can you over rate something this good?Ignorance is never attractive, mind you, neither is invective but, sometimes ignorant MFs have got to be pistol-whipped til they see the truth.The people that gave this album 4 stars will be pleased to know Nora Jones's new album is out...go listen to it and leave us (that's me, Jimmy and Stanley) alone.6 stars y'all."
5,Not an expert...but I know what I like!,"This is a great and unique quartet. Organ, Guitar, Sax, Drums, that's it. VERY cool and interesting sound and some rippin' compositions. Highly recommended!"
2,Waste of money,This only comes with vehicle plug & we wanted it for office. Only holds small cans...not any normal size bottles of pop. Make one that will hold both cans & bottles...since most pop comes in the(plastic)bottles...that COOLS. Bought for my son for his office for his pop & does not work for that!!
4,a great book...but not complete,"After I watched the Wedding Peach anime I was totally psyched to buy the manga. When I bought Wedding Peach:Young Love I totally loved it. I read it a million times and never got tired of it, but I soon was disapointed. I found out on Nao Yazawa's website that Viz cut out an important chapter in the book. Momoko, Yuri, Hinagiku, and Yosuke go to the swimming pool and Potomos arrives and falls in love with Yosuke. Also since this chapter was cut many things later in the book dont make sense, like in the chapter when the girls and Yosuke go to the school ball, Potomos comes back and Momoko knows who she is. How could Momoko know Potomos name if she never met her. Also they show shots of them at the swimming pool later on. I don't know why they made a cut. They were stupid, or forgot to put it in"
3,Stories are great but video is poor,"Watching Miami Vice again brought back fond memories of the times. It was definitely a trend setter for its time. You will enjoy the stories and the characters as they are developed.My disappointment was the poor image quality. Some episodes appear to be taken from video tape that had been played multiple times. Snowy, grainy and fuzzy at times. Also there were spots that looked like holes on worn film. Then as I am watching it in order I get to the last disc, season five disc five, only to find that instead of disc five it was another copy of disc two.Be sure and check all discs when it arrives."
5,"Emmy Award Winning Miami Vice, 5 Seasons, 27 One-Sided Discs, 111 Episodes = 100% Super!!!!","Not only do you get every episode, all on 1 sided discs, but on disc one you get bonus material as follows: ""The Vibe of Vice"", ""Building the Perfect Vice"", ""The Style of Vice"", ""The Music of Vice"", and ""Miami After Vice"". This package includes all 5 seasons. My favorite episode is the ""Smuggler's Blues"" from season 1, where Glenn Frey guest stars as a smuggling airplane pilot, and his song ""Smuggler's Blues"" is played throughout the episode. Back in the 1980's a Miami Radio Station played that song, over & over for 24 hours.Also, there are many more Rock Stars, as guest stars, included in this complete series, such as Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, The Who, Aerosmith, Guns & Roses, The Cure, Public Enemy, Ted Nugent, and many more.If you like Miami Vice, then ""The Complete Series"", is the best way to go. I definitely recommend the ""Complete Series"". Thanks!!!!"
4,Coolest Show of the 80's,"So far I've only made it through Season 3 of Miami Vice. I was a huge fan of this series back in the 80's. All 5 seasons are in this boxed set and I found the price to be a decent one compared to other sellers. The box is made to resemble alligator skin and is white. If you remember, Crockett had a pet alligator named Elvis on his boat.The quality of the discs has been okay if a bit grainy but that hasn't been a big issue with me. My biggest beef is that one of the discs (Season 2, disc 4, episode 14) had several ""bad spots"" in it and froze up on me. I had to fast forward through those places, which was annoying.All in all, so far, I've been happy with the set and hearing some of the sound tracks, reliving the episodes, etc has been worth a few ""bad spots."" For that reason I could not give this a 5 star."
4,Excellent Price!,Very quick shipping! Alligator box had a rip in it but box was sealed in shrinkwrap. Played one disc so far and it played flawlessly. All and all an excellent price!
3,Everything was fine except for...........,There is a disc missing in my Season 1 box. Bought this from Amazon and it came in plastic. Why is my disk missing?
5,Timeless.,"At 1.5 million per episode, Miami Vice was by far the most well produced show of it's day. Compare at 2 million per for 24. First to use current hit music as one of the stars of the show."
5,MIAMI VICE TV series,"MIAMI VICE TV Series! DVD'S EXCELLENT! Clear pictures, Real ""MIAMI"" scenery. Well done. Bravo.First of all it makes me feel young again! All actors wonderful, professional. I love the Music, A Blast in every episode.The Car, The Boat the aligator ""ELVIS"" so original!Don Johnson, Philip Michael Thomas so Cute! Where are you???I recommend to anyone Miami Vice TV series who love ENTERTAIMENT!5 stars!Mrs. Lise Girard, Maryland USA"
5,Miami Vice--better than ever!,"Who could ""do"" Sonny Crockett better than Don Johnson? NO ONE! I am enjoying the Miami Vice experience all over again. It's ageless!Sandy"
1,"Poor, very poor","As a seasoned trader using elliott wave myself I found this book to be confusing at best. Once you get past the numerous typographical errors (the difference between wave a and wave A causes much confusion for example) you are dealing with a book that is mostly just a semblence of hand completed charts espouted in any old order the writer fancied. The strange thing is that these charts, and the methods described all date from 1994. Disregard the published in 2001 notice.The author has overcomplicated the method he describes. This has certainly done my trading more harm than good. And I was already pretty proficient in Wave theory! He would have you create vastly overcomplicated charts and overlays to carry out this method. He then has the cheek to show various intraday examples of his work. This would simply be too short a time frame to carry out his instructions. So it ain't ""real time"" either."
2,Subjective ?,"I realize that Elliott Wave is considered subjective .. but on half of these wave counts, I couldn't see where he was coming up with his numbers. In addition, he had numerous 7 wave (?) counts and some of his logic is just plain odd. I consider myself fairly experienced in Elliott Wave, but couldn't figure this guy out for most of the book. Walker tries to time failures of the C wave and tries to find ends to corrections , but is an aggressive entry method if correct. The problem is, it is extremely difficult to see .. as corrections can materialize into many forms and stop you out over and over until it presents a discernable pattern. One thing I did find unique in this book was his use of finding wave counts within simple patterns of OHLC bars. Seems a bit like overkill, but it is unique nevertheless."
5,Great Worship,This album is a great album to woship and praise with. I love the level of intimacy with God that this album carries. AWESOME!
5,Great book!,I've been using this journal since 1999. I love how there are separate entries for each day and you write in the date.
5,A Great Coffee Table book! [as a gift or for yourself],"This is the perfect gift/souvenir for anyone who has ever wanted a pictorial tour of Singapore. Whether you live in Singapore, have visited it, or have wondered about it, this is a great book to have. The pictures may even surprise those who live in Singapore. It will bring back exciting memories for those who visited while perhaps highlighting some of the areas that they missed out while visiting. And it will also give those who have never visited, a wonderful glimpse into one of the most unique and fascinating countries in Southeast Asia."
1,Not the original,"If you're looking for the original ""Mambo #5"" (the one they play on the radio), this is NOT the CD. ""Lou Bega"" is the artist, not ""Latin Lou."" You can draw your own conclusions, but I know I feel duped for buying this."
3,It's a nice complement but not enough by itself,"This book provides a good set of practice questions, ordered by difficulty level. This is a nice feature to reinforce weak areas, but is not enough to be your main source aid to prepare for the GMAT. The test taking techniques are good, but not for everyone. For instance, I couldn't get used to applying most of them, but they must be useful for some people.Also, the online material (2 CAT'S) didn't really convince me because they had a flaw in the timing, and the feedback isn't as thorough as Kaplan's CAT's.On the upside, I found the Math review to be quite on target and should be easy to grasp for people with non quantitative backgrounds.Overall, the the Princeton Review is good to have as secondary reference and for consult when another view is needed, but it shouldn't be your only source. I'd recommend to get this book with the Official GMAT Review by GMAC."
5,Great tips,"This book has some great tips on how to answer questions. Thought the strategies were stronger in math than verbal. Hints for AWA were great, like make the essay as long as possible. You definitely need to suppliment with the official book and a computer practice test, but this book will give you some great strategies - I got a 780 and 6.0 on AWA!"
1,Junk,The Westek light sets are junk. My set of three has gone through about 12 bulbs in 4 months of sporadic use. This doesn't include the bulbs whose electrodes broke off when trying to replace them. Buy something else.
4,for the two songs,"I mainly bought this CD for ""one night in bangkok"" and ""Broken Wings"" that alone was worth the price. The rest of the songs aren't bad either. overall, a nice compalation."
1,"sneezing, runny nose",I have had a severe cold now for 5 days. The Chlortrimeton (Chlorpheniraminein ) this medication ( antihistamine) does nothing for a running nose or sneezing.This is the second time I've tried this for a cold. Maybe it would work for an allergy as opposed to a cold. but for a cold it's useless. Does absolutely nothing to dry up your nose at all.And there is nothing else on the market for those with hypertension and colds. So just buy 3 or 4 boxes of kleenex.
4,Excellent read!,"Absolutly fantastic series! I loved it. While not as good as some of the author's best works, such as Dragon's of Summer Flame, the series was brilliant.I most assuredly recommend all fantasy lovers to buy a copy right now a read it."
5,This book had one of the best takes on religion I've seen.,"First of all, I read this series a long time ago, but I remember it as one of my favorites. The characters were powerful and enduring (that's why I still remember). I realize it wasn't as com- mercially popular as the Drangonlance series, but the ROP books had one of the most realistic takes on religion I've seen, and were really geared towards more sophisticated fantasy readers. So what if it wasn't D&D, it was unique, and the best work Weis and Hickman have ever done."
2,Missing something,Not sure what all the buzz is about these books. I thought that this series was just average. The lead characters seemed too caught up in their own pride to be heros. There was nothing really wrong with these books. They just lacked the spirit and the completeness that other weis and hickman series had. There was just something missing.
3,Its okay. Not the best books ever,"Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman have some awesome books. However, this series is just okay. The idea for the plot was a pretty good one and some of the characters were very cool. There were some critical story components that were either missing or weak. First of all, most of the characters are too wrapped up in the ""at least I will die with honor"" mindset. Everyone was willing to die with pride then take a timeout and think about the situation he/she was in. This got really old after a while. Also, the essence of Magic was really weak in these books. I usually find magic to be one of the more interesting aspects of the fantasy books. Magic played only a very small role in this series. My recommendation is to find something else to read and read this series only as a last resort."
2,Watch out,"My son got this toy for his birthday and was so excited. It did not take more than five minutes after we opened the box, when he came back crying because the body of the batman broke in half. It was very disspointing, we expected a much better quality from Mattel brand."
2,Didn't like this book at all.,"The Laments started with promise. The prose was fun to read, and easy on the brain. That does not mean that is was simplistic...not at all. The author knows how to write.But after the initial several pages, I found myself wondering about everything other then the book.I found the Laments to be dull, and a bit bloated with too much non-story. The author leaves the present day right off the back, and jumps headlong into flashbacks. This style of writing really detracts from the story, as you find yourself waiting for a point to come.Not a book I would recommend."
4,Highly Readable Debut Novel,"George Lament is convinced things must be better elsewhere. So much so, that he is continually uprooting his family to move on to better things. Along for the ride are his wife and three sons. Hagen does a great job at depicting his characters. Particularly rich are Julia, the mother, and the eldest son, Will. The novel is equal parts family drama and coming-of-age tale and quite funny as well. Despite a few contrived and down-right odd plot points, this highly enjoyable novel is a pleasure to read thanks to exceptional pacing and writing that avoids getting bogged down in detail."
5,One of my favorite books of 2009!,"Even though George Hagen's ""The Laments"" was published back in 2004, I just picked up a copy of it earlier this year. It sounded kind of like a John Irving novel--a story about a quirky, somewhat dysfunctional family over a period of years. And I wasn't disappointed. Hagen has written a fabulous first novel that is laugh-out-loud funny as well as being a great character study with some unexpected twists and turns. The Laments are Howard and Julia and their three sons, and the book follows them as they move from South Africa to England and, finally, to America. They are a fascinating family to spend time with, and my only disappointment in Hagen's debut was at the end--because I wanted more! ""The Laments"" is a terrific read, which I highly recommend."
5,The Laments by George Hagen,"This is by far one of the best books I have read, ever. Funny, sad, shocking. George Hagen has captured it all. Don't miss his second book, ""Tom Bedlam"". Another outstanding read. I just hope Hollywood doesn't get their hands on either one!"
3,An Almost Perfect Read,"What this book needed was an experienced and heavy handed editor who could argue with an excellent first time author about one unsettling plot point very late in the novel. While that plot point and tragedy did not entirely spoil the fun -- it was only because I edited it out in my mind.Until then there are a lot of funny set pieces, and the most hilarious set of twins in a long time in literature.I have lived on all the continents the Laments do as a child and in almost the exact countries -- so perhaps I recognized many of the issues facing the son, Will -- such as always being the new kid, and leaving girlfriends every time a move occurs.I recommend this book, and yes, it's a bit like Garp, although John Irving's book is a classic by a major author and The Laments is an excellent first effort that won't let you down and will have you laughing along at and with the Laments."
4,Globe Trotting Laments,"Some people have compared first time novelist George Hagen to John Irving. The similarities are there: the comic overtones to a tragic situation, an eccentric family, and most importantly a collection of characters you grow to love.""The Laments"" has all of that. A horrible accident leads to Julia and Howard Lament leaving the hospital with a baby that is not biologically theirs. Young Will Lament is raised without the knowledge of his birthright, and soon what begins in South Africa, ends in America with their growing family staking their indvidual claims before they're uprooted agin by the whimsy of Howard.Yes, the book feels similar in tone to something that Irving would write,yet it has enough of its own uniqueness to stand apart. It's both a very funny and very touching book."
3,Eccentricity Defined,...and I thought my family was bizarre and eccentric. The Laments is a fine book. Certainly not the best family sagas I've tacked but definitely one of the most unique.
3,Flashback hijinx....,"Just what timeframe is this novel supposed to be taking place in? I've only done the first fifty pages, and so far, it's hopped around through three generations, talked about an adopted orphan a couple took to compensate for the loss of their own child in an auto accident right after it was born after the woman who gave birth to their ADOPTED child bonded with it through experimental wet-nursing, set up by a doctor who seems to be a lot less remorseful then he ought to be and THEN gives you back story on a few people a couple of score years back....it's all so hard to keep track of, and the danged novel is just getting STARTED!! Thankfully, it's well written, but the author's time juxtaposition could use a WEE bit 'o' help!I shall keep you posted on this one...."
3,Kept Waiting For Something to Happen,"This novel follows the lives of Julia and Howard Lament, starting out with the young couple in a South African maternity ward to have their first child. After another woman in the wards kidnaps and kills their biological baby, Howard and Julia raise the other family's child, Will, as their own. The novel covers Will's life to age 18 as the family moves to Bahrain, Rhodesia, England, and finally, America.The blurb on the back of the novel says something about how zany the Lament family is, but they are really very pedestrian. The writing is very good, but I kept waiting for something to happen to the characters. With one notable exception, literally nothing memorable happens for the middle 200-300 pages of the book. I kept wishing I were reading a truly zany family tale likeThe Hotel New Hampshire (Ballantine Reader's Circle)orGeek Love: A Novel(Not for the faint of heart)."
4,Noticing a difference already,"I've been listening to this tape for about a week so far and I've noticed a difference in my anger control already. My friends and family have noticed, too."
1,The word 'disappointed' doesn't even cover it.,"Cello strings are quite expensive, so I thought I was getting a deal getting this one on amazon for only ten dollars. However, I was incredibly disappointed when I finally recieved it. First of all, it wasn't in it's original packaging as shown. Secondly, it was used. Last of all, IT WASN'T EVEN A CELLO STRING. It was a USED guitar string! I was beyond upest. Rest assured I will never buy from THIS user ever again. What a jerk."
3,"Bluesy, Southern hard rock","One of the later bands to emerge from the Hollywood rock scene was Asphalt Ballet. The band released their self-titled debut album in 1992, just as the hair metal party was coming to a close. The band had a melodic hard rock sound with a slightly bluesy, slightly Southern edge, sort of like Skid Row meets Junkyard. A lot of that style came from vocalist Gary Jeffries and his southern fried vocals.This is a totally rockin' album with plenty of swagger. If you're a fan of bands like Junkyard, Tangier, Royal Court of China, and Jetboy, you'll want to check this album out. It's nothing you haven't heard before, but it's still a solid, enjoyable rock & roll album.Unfortunately the future wasn't too bright for Asphalt Ballet. They tried to adapt to the grunge sound with their 1993 follow-up albumPigs, but it didn't seem to please the fans or the band, whose members soon went their separate ways."
2,"Not Jack Rose, Fahey or Basho",This CD came up in my Pandora Jack Rose Radio. Actually there are 2 solo pieces in this CD that might be close to JR. The rest is not. I just had a different expectation.Tansu
1,Poorly built,"I really wish I could share a great story about how the light therapy has changed my life. Unfortunately the only thing I learned about light therapy over the last couple of weeks is that most of the cost must be in research. For this price, you would think that you had something that was well built. My guess is that soldering connections are done poorly.The first unit I received worked for about 5 minutes. That is how long the batter must have lasted from the factory charge because when I plugged the charger in, nothing happened. I cheked the charger with a voltmeter and it was working, so the issue was an internal connection.The second unit worked for about 20 minutes before all the lights begain to flicker. If you tapped it, they would come back on, but after a few times, they were just all gone.The product comes with a two year warrantee, but nobody wants something that is going to have to be sent back every other week."
2,fast delivery but the product didn't work properly,Fast delivery but the product didn't work properly so I had to send it back.
3,"Quality product, but...","...it didn't actually do anything for me. I gave up on it after a few weeks. I have not actually been diagnosed with SAD, so take my experience for what it's worth. The product itself is well made and was easy to operate. If it worked for me, I would probably have preferred a battery operated unit, but they were quite a bit more money."
3,P1 Golite NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY PHILLIPS,"I bought this last year and feel it worked.However,I just contacted Phillips who acquired the Golite brand at 800-545-9667 to see if I could geta product user manual and maybe check into a battery upgrade. (it would be VERY nice for it to be portable)The woman who answered was not helpful and not so nice,,, everything I asked was an annoyance to her and she told meto call back and ask for ""Kathy"". (wouldn't take my number) I was told this P1 model is discontinued an no longer supported.Take this into account when you consider a purchase and maybe give a test call before you plunk your money down."
2,Is not rechargable without extra battery pack,"Buyer Beware: Even though this product looks like it is portable, it does NOT come with a rechargable battery. You have to either plug it in every time you use it or pay an extra $40 for an ""optional"" separate battery pack (directly from the company). The advertising keeps that fact tucked away. It seems to work okay but the fact that the thing is small and ""portable"" is useless when you need to keep it tethered to an electrical outlet."
2,fell short of my expectations,I bought this product after reading the rave reviews about it. Truth is that it never seem to do anything for my depression. I ended up returning the product and that in itself was a long process because there are some rules u must follow when u buy things third party like amazon. Read the return policies and inform yourself before buying any of this. Good luck.
1,doesn't work for me,"First, BEWARE of terrible return policy from The Natural Health Shoppe! Once it's opened, NO RETURN. I foolishly thought the return policy would be like Amazon's or I would not have taken a chance spending so much money. Now I wasted all that money because I'm one that this does not work for. No matter where I place it in my field of vision, all those little bright LEDs make a glare in my eyes, even at 50%, and I end up with eyestrain and a headache, and my vision is staying washed out for the whole day. Definitely no mood improvement for me. I have a Blue Max 10,000 lux lamp and that works wonderfully.I thought this might be good to take places and travel with. Too bad!"
1,"Caution, SAD sufferers, full-spectrum works better for me","I have used the original Apollo Light, full spectrum/10,000 lux for around 10 years, and it always amazed me how well it worked. Even this year, I began to have difficulty waking up in the morning, and my depression set in, at the end of September. I began using my 10,000 lux, and the next day, I woke up more easily, and felt better. I decided to try the GoLite Blue, because of the claims in the ad, that it was so much better. When it arrived, I loaned the old one to a friend, as I began to use the new one. Well, my previous improvement declined. I got depressed, again, and with difficulty waking in the morning. So, I resumed using the full spectrum light, and feel better again. Here is the link to the one I used beforeApollo Health briteLITE 6. Good luck; depression sucks!!!"
1,Problems with toxicity,"I've been using this device for several years, and it works very well for SAD. I recently discovered, however, that blue light in this spectrum is potentially damaging to the eyes. I'm a psychotherapist, and have recommended light therapy to my clients for years, because of its effectiveness. Now I'm suggesting that folks look instead for full spectrum light boxes, or those that produce blue green light, which is much safer. I will never use this particular unit again, and am upset that a big company like Phillips isn't more careful in what they sell."
3,No timed onset feature,"I have not used this yet--just received it--but I am disappointed to discover the product lacks an ability to turn itself on at a pre-specified time! The timing feature alluded to in the product description only relates to various automated timed offsets from a manual onset. The P2 model, however, does have alarm clock like automated timed onsets."
4,Keeps the circadian clock regulated but does not help SAD enough,"I bought this after using the day light uplift for several months and having only partial response. That light actually filters the blue spectrum and is not very effective for regulating the sleep clock. This light helps the sleep cycle but does not really help mood directly. What I am realizing is there are different kinds of SAD. Some which are more sleep clock related and some which are more neurotransmitter related or some other mechanism which bright light effects, but this blue light does not. Perhaps the qi field or third chakra. In any case, I use this light along with a bright white light for a few hours a day and am SAD free. This light alone did not prevent changes in mood at all for me. It does keep the sleep cycle on schedule with just 15 mins of use in the morning."
3,Ok for Mild SAD,"I live in Fairbanks, Alaska--ground zero for SAD. I've found that this lamp works alright in the fall, but is insufficient during the short days of winter. The GoLite is very small, so even swinging my head around while eating breakfast or working at my desk will take my face out of the lamp's range and make it less effective. I've had better luck with the DayLight, which is much larger and keeps me flooded in light even if I move around my seating area; I need less time under it than under the GoLite even in the deep of winter. The GoLite's portability seemed convenient when I bought it, but it loses its charge quickly, which makes it difficult to use for extended periods of time. I'm keeping the GoLite for travel and for use on my nightstand in the mornings, but I wouldn't recommend it as a primary lightbox."
5,Simple and perfect,"This is attractive, fits easily on the counter or in the cupboard, and works perfectly. I love it."
4,"I found that this product, Silken Secret, was ...","I found that this product, Silken Secret, was good. I think the individual applicator is a good idea. The applicators were easy to use. It's very convenient, with no waste. This product is all that its box says. I didn't find it irritating. It's long lasting and an enhancement. I'd recommend this product to a family member or friend."
3,This is a personal product that can be ...,"This is a personal product that can be used to restore moisture the body has lost due to aging, childbirth, menopause, or whatever reason. This product may also be used to enhance intimate activities. I found this product to be especially useful after the recent birth of my first child. The applicators are easy to use and there's a natural feeling about this product."
3,This moisturizer is more fluid than I thought ...,"This moisturizer is more fluid than I thought it would be. If you squeeze out too much at a time, it can get away from you. However, it did well at not getting sticky and not drying up too quickly."
4,Astroglide Silken Moisturizer is a good product for ...,Astroglide Silken Moisturizer is a good product for women who need extra moisturizing during intimate occasions. I found this product to be very convenient and lasting. I didn't find any problems with it. I definitely would recommend it to anyone who needs this type of product. The name says it all!
3,I'm still looking for the perfect lube,"Why does it cost more than KY????Because it's supposed to be secret, that's why!Did not work any better."
2,Abridged version,"I was terribly disappointed to find after purchasing this book as well as book 2 in the series that it is an abridged version. I wish that fact had been advertised on Amazon as I would have searched for an older complete version.I love the series, but I and my children want the original version, not a shortened one."
5,A book full fo historical information.,"Little House by Boston Bay follows Charlotte Tucker, a 5 year old girl, through the summer and fall of 1814. It is full of historical information and great descriptions of day-to-day life. Entertaining to read, and the book flap indicates it is recommended for grades 3-7. The writing style strikes me as young for higher grades. This book should be of interest to students who enjoy historical stories of the 18th century in the times of the Boston Tea Party."
5,A WONDERFUL START!,"This is the first book of the new series about Charlotte Tucker, Caroline's mother. You should definitely enjoy this book if you are a Little House fan. It takes place during the War of 1812, and even discusses what is happening with the war. Besides that, you will meet Charlotte and share her many adventures. Charlotte was born just one generation after America was formed which doubles the excitement. You can read about Charlotte's many adventures. Charlotte has several brothers, and sisters which makes it even more interesting. Charloote has Scottish backround, and you can learn about Scottish traditions, and stories. Also don't forget to keep up with Charlotte's ongoing childhood series!!!!!!!"
2,Not as durable as other Jakks toys,"I usually have fairly good luck with Jakks dog toys as they tend to last at least a couple of weeks for my dogs, but this particular one only lasted for a couple of minutes unfortunately. What was especially disappointing was that the material they used to make this toy seems to be substandard compared to the others. My dogs like to nibble to make a hole to take the stuffing out, but with this toy they were just able to rip the fabric apart with no effort.I will continue to buy Jakks Pacific toys since their toys seemed to be made the toughest, but I'm obviously disappointed with this particular one. Hopefully, this was an aberration."
4,Slightly Loose Snap,It is just what I needed except the snap isn't tight enough but not bad enough to return.
2,Not worth it!,"The MS Press books and Syngress titles will serve you better than this book. While there is some useful information in the book, it is not nearly enough to justify the purchase.You will be better served looking elsewhere for resources for the 70-298 exam. Transcender is a good place to start."
3,It's ok,"I bought this when my son was six months old, and he didn't really like it, so it went away. Now he is a year old, and when I brought it out to check for the sharp edges, he of course wanted to play wih it. Here is the drop box url, because my phone stops uploading in the middle of the upload: [...]There are no sharp edges or paint, just ribbon, rubber and plastic, and elastic holding the middle part on."
1,This is the worst motivational book I have read.,"The author spends half the book selling his real estate courses and the other half posting missives and quotes that are inappropriate for the content. The only reason for the overly large type style is to allow the scarce material to fill a small book.The author rambles from one subject to another inside single paragraph and cannot hold a thought for more than a few sentances. It is very difficult to read.The productive ideas in this book could have been printed on a single sheet of paper and mailed out in a chain letter. The ideas are not clearely defined, give no or poor examples, and present nothing new or expanded.Confirmation of the quality of this book is represented in those individuals offering a recommendation in the cover....The individuals with comments are not known in the business or motivation community.The author may be a fine person, but this book is not a reflection of an organized mind. He needs a very good and very brutal editor."
1,Childish- Don't Waste Your Money On This Book!,"Very disappointed in this book. Vague, almost incoherent at times. Seems as though very little thought or energy went into this book. Almost reads like a childrens book. It's no wonder the type is do big, he really doesn't say much and seems to ramble just to fill up a few more pages."
4,Wonderful,"After seeing the video special on channel 6 in Paris late at night, just like another reviewer here at Amazon, I went in search. The album is great and I play it constantly. The songs are catchy and nicely recorded. There is a bonus video at the end which will give you a sample of his live show. The guy is absolutely great live. An inspiration for me being a singer/ songwriter."
4,Beautiful but it is smaller than it appears,"Beautiful Watch, very well constructed and the silver sides looks amazin polished. Just be aware that this watch is best suit for who is skinny because it is not so big."
4,Less is Better,"I had never heard Rob Rock before but I do own the previous Warrior discs, so I figured that it would be good. I was not disappointed. Joe Floyd's riffs are as solid as ever and the singing was on target. This record has all of the feel of the traditional warrior sound while being updated for the new century. The album has good, tight sounding metal tunes. The rythym section pounds along while the guitar playing is furious and melodic. Standout cuts are ""Day of Reckoning"", ""Kill the Machine"", ""Code of Life"" and ""We are One"". If you like traditional metal, you will like this CD."
4,A ROCKIN ALBUM BY WARRIOR,"I did not like ANCIENT FUTURE - thought it was too cheesy and very generic power metal; I would not give it to my daughters or anyone.But to my surprise, CODE OF LIFE was a real nice comeback - real tight, solid heavy sound, more bottom end, real rockin rhythm. A very good album that allows you to be introduced to WARRIOR."
4,Worth your money!,"This album has some great songs to remember times gone by. But one song makes the album worth the price. Dennis DeYoung's Desert Moon is beautiful. It is hard to get this song,so placing it on compliation is truly worth the price. Not to mention the great .38 Special song. A must have album for anyone who has a fond memory of 1984!"
5,Heavyweight works well,"This is heavier than normal, but as a banner it doesn't rip as easily and regular Coated paper and it is a very inexpensive alternative to Tyvek."
5,A classic that didn't get a fair shake,"Not only did this movie come from a true story, but it was a great story.And on top of this it was very well told with an all star cast including Forest Whitaker, Isaiah Washington, and others you'll recognize.The movie shows just enough of Katrina footage to remind us of the travesty of the storm and our handling of the aftermath - but it does not over do it. Then it moves on at a perfect pace to the story of rebuilding. It comes with inspiring words balanced with a real glimpse of the dirty and slow process it was in New Orleans.It's crazy that this never hit the big screen because it was so good, because it was a true story, and because it had an Academy Award Winner and stars like Lil Wayne.It really should sit on everyone's shelf along side your true story sports classics like The Blind Side, Hoosiers, More than a Game, Glory Road, Miracle, Cinderella Man, Brian's Song, and Remember the Titans."
2,Hurrican Season,I liked this film. I learned about this team durning the Hurricane Katrina disaster and wanted to see more of it. Always like the actor.
1,THIS IS NOT THE BUZZCOCKS PETE SHELLEY,DO NOT BUT THIS WORTHLESS PIECE OF CRAP UNLEE YOU LIKE CHEESEY70'S SOUNDING LOUNGE/COUNTRY MUSIC THIS AWFUL!!!!!!THIS IS NOT A PETE SHELLEY OF THE BUZZCOCKS CD BEWARE!!!!!!
4,Great Book,"I had read this book for a book report in my U.S. History class, and I decided to read this book because I really like to learn about the Pilgrims. All in all, this is a great book and I think that Jr. High kids will like to read about this."
4,Very good,This book is very valuable for someone who wants to become a Jazz pianist. It explains how to build the most common Jazz chords and what notes can be used to improvise in a given key. The content is quite detailed and full of real-world examples. The only negative thing is that the content is almost the same as Mark Levine's other book 'Jazz Theory'.
2,Only for the advanced piano player,"I consider myself to be an intermediate piano player. But this book I found to be very challenging and intimidating. It is only for the advanced piano player. And unless you have an extensive Jazz music collection, you will won't recognize a majority of the songs in this book. So that makes it even harder to play and learn the material.The book would probably make a great reference....but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are already a professional Jazz piano player, if not someone who is already playing in a Jazz trio or quartet."
3,Good on Theory; No treatment of rhythm skills or melodic improvisation,"I ordered this as a Kindle Book - my mistake; you cant read a ""how-to"" music theory book on a computer screen. You need the hard copy open when working through the examples. It took me a while to find this book deals mainly with scale and harmonic theory. There is little to help a first year jazz novice to develop essential skills for rhythmic, melodic improvisation, and no chapter on blues technique. However the chapters on stride, block chords, comping and Latin styles are very helpful. I use Bert Ligon's ""Connecting Chords with Linear Harmony"" book to fill the improvisation gap."
5,An Outstanding Book,"I'm a little over half-way through this book, so maybe I'm not fully qualified to review it. However, let me say this: I am a USCF Expert, I've been playing chess for over thirty years, and I've read at least three hundred chess books. This is, quite simply, one of the best chess books I have ever read. If you're looking for an instructive chess book with some new ideas in it, this book is for you. If there's a bad part, I haven't found it yet."
4,"Excellent Book - clear, concise and comforting","Well written, clear, easy to read and comforting in that you realize many people suffer to varying degrees with this. So glad I read this book."
2,not very informative,"This book was very general in it's approach to explaining SAD -- it may be good for the casual reader that knows nothing about the disorder, but I didn't feel it was a good source of reliable information. Also there were quite a few instances where the author starts to talk about a topic, and then says you need to buy another book, or go to see him to have that resolved. It's an easy read, but I didn't feel any smarter after having read the book."
3,Super Reader,"Perry and a few others from the Stardust investigate an incredibly high gravity planet, with the aid of special technology.There, they are harrassed by what seem to be phantoms, but in reality they are the energy denizens of the world, adapted for living there."
1,Deceived,After our first child my lady has been a bit self conscious We purchased this item for function and fun. However the first time out the zipper separated. I left a disagreeable comment and was immediately contacted by the seller. Summit fashions. They assured me all would be resolved if I removed the comment which I did). No resolution was ever found(in other words we never heard from them again). We waited and waited and finally determined that they would not follow up with their end of the return agreement. It was a waste of time dealing with this seller and this product If they contact you to remove your feedback. DO NOT DO IT.
5,So nice and so inexpensive!,"I was really surprised at how well crafted this item is, for such a low price. It looks beautiful and is surprisingly comfortable. The zipper up the front (instead of extensive lacing) makes it easy to wear and enables one to wear it under her garments. I'm very impressed."
4,Takes time to open,"Works great but remember like with any combo lock, it's tricky, you have to turn it the right way to open. We have it on our house that we are selling by owner. So far no real estate agents have let us know they had a difficult time with it."
3,A good introduction to the GMAT,This book provided a good basic review of the GMAT. The strategies described would be useful for someone aiming for a 600.For those with aims in the high 600's or 700's I recommend completing all the questions in the Official Guides and taking a look at the offerings from Manhattan GMAT.Using these resources and gmatclub forums I was able to score well on my first attempt.
5,Really good,"I got a lot of recomendations for this book over the Kaplan's, and is really great. But is recomended purchase also the officials guides, by our experience and also in the book."
3,Princeton Review,"This is a good book for strategy and to learn the tips and tricks instead of performing the calculations. It had been a long time for me to go over high school/college math and I started with the Original Guide, then picked up this book to learn the tips and tricks. I intend on using it to finish my preparation again to raise the score by a few points when I am ready."
3,"Great book, mediocre online freebies","I got this book and took the GMAT yesterday. I scored a 750 on the GMAT, and many of the techniques were VERY useful. One of the big bonuses that the book touts, however, is ""4 free online practice tests."" These tests were horrible.Compare: Using the ETS/GMAC practice tests, I scored 650 ad 690, then 750 on the actual test.When I took the PR practice tests online, the site was slow and buggy, I scored 570-610, and several of the questions were just plain wrong: Bad editing, etc. There were several that had wrong answers inthe math section. I remember one question in reading comprehension where they used ""Antebellum"" in place of ""Postbellum"". A fairly important distinction.By all means, get the book-- just get the $14 one. The extras in the DVD and online tests are not worth your money. If you want practice tests, get the ones from GMAC at http://www.gmat.com/ ."
4,good,"i can't say it is THE PERFECT review book, but must say it is better than kaplan. kaplan seems to be much easier than the actual exam itself."
4,Better than nothing,"I found the questions to be a bit rudimentary. The classes might help. but you're probably better off with Kaplan, etc. classes and mentoring."
5,Cracking the GMAT,I really think this is the best book to buy; I bought this along with the Official Guide for GMAT Review (which I haven't gotten to yet). Originally I started with the Barrons book which has a lot of wrong answers and does not clearly explain why an answer is wrong/right. I didn't even finish using it.This book explains reasoning for every single question and also provides quick but thorough reviews of various topics and concepts so that you don't have to hunt down your 10th grade geometry book.
2,Purchase the 2008 Edition...its the same,There is no need to purchase the 2012 Edition of Cracking the GMAT. I found just a few differences between the 2008 edition and the 2012. Save some money and purchase the 2008 edition.
3,I didn't even touch this book.,"I used The Official Guide for GMAT Review more often. I was married to that book for 3 months, but this book I barely even touched. I read through it once, felt it was a waste of time, and never had to use it again. I don't agree with most of the tactics in this book and I find their tactics to be a waste of precious exam time, misleading, and are more likely to lead to mistakes. I think these tactics are nice if you have no idea what you're doing and you plan to guess your way through the exam, but if you have any decent skills then you should just abandon the tactics this book tries to feed you and do the test by actually knowing your material.Seriously, why in the world would you read the answers first before you read the questions? Always read the questions first so you know what you're looking for in an answer. Read the questions, and read them carefully. Make sure you know what the question is asking before you even look at the answers."
4,a good start,"This book is a good beginning. If you're not familiar with the GMAT, I would recommend starting with this book"
2,Good if you're just trying to get a decent score for an OK school,"If you want 600+, forget it. But if you are a complete idiot, esp when it comes to Math, then this book is for you. I must admit, the explanations provided are very easy to understand. But All the questions (along with 1000+ questions and whatever from Princeton) are pathetically easy. Good enough to study so that you won't embarrass yourself with a 400. Try Kaplan 800 or the Manhattan GMAT and don't waste your money here, esp if you are going for and top b-school out there (and I'm not even talking about Ivy Leagues places ...)."
1,"Good Book, Horrible, Horrible Shipping","I purchased this product with the understanding that I would recieve it within a week. I purchased it at the end of September and did not recieve it until mid to late October. For students looking to begin studying quickly, this is not a place to order your book. However, the book was in great condition."
2,Good but cheated out of practice tests,The book gives good advice regarding how to analyze questions. I attempted to download the practice materials and the web site told me my account existed. I tried a second email address and somehow that address existed as well.
4,I passed using this,I had only a few months to study and not every day and I only used this book (and the free practice test that the Gmac mails out) and I got a 500 on the test. It was harder than the SAT but the advice on the video w/ the book and the practice tests ( I recommend that one focus on the tests above all) and you can do well. I did not study as much as I could have
4,Timely and good delivery!!,The book was delivered to me in time and in a good shape.The book is good to revive your basics and get familiar with GMAT.
3,Test Prep material is good. Tests are below average,"This book is good to refresh your concepts and to browse over quickly what you probably forgot since high school, but thats about it. The tests are totally way off the actual GMAT.Especially the Math section on the online tests is too simple, and the actual GMAT questions are a few notches higher.All in all, not worth buying. You could probably get one from a library to use. I'd recommend Kaplan to this one."
4,Good book for GMAT,"This is a great book for practicing questions, it offers a little bit of all types of questions. This book is especially good for starters, but the major drawback is that it doesn't offer too much of mathematical review or strategies. Luckily, i bought the ""EZ GMAT - Math Strategies"" book along with this book. It helped me a lot by applying the math strategies given in the EZ GMAT book to the question in this book.EZ GMAT - Math Strategies"
1,This film is a piece of crap in a brilliant director's career...,"It was tacky and irritating... It could have only been done in the early 80s and in France... The only redeeming quality was Fanny Ardant... At that point of her life she was one of the most beautiful & attractive women ever... What was in Resnais' mind?... I watched this the day after I experienced 'Love onto Death' which I thought was a great meditation on life and death... If you want to witness what a medicore foreign film looks like, please download Life is a Bed of Roses... Avoid paying anything (like I did) to get this one..."
3,Works OK,My gate is a 5 foot wide iron gate and the spring will close it most of the time. Might add another spring to help.
2,substandard,"This product was shipped in a flimsy box that is totally unsuitable for the product. Upon delivery, the box had been crumpled in several places, and the tub was dented.The assembly instructions are cryptic and the design is very poor. When assembled this wheelbarrow lists a bit to one side. I called the manufacturer's hotline for assistance, and they quickly brushed me off telling me that I would need to speak with Amazon. The only reason that I am not sending it back is because I do not want to go through the hassle of getting a large sturdy box to ship it back. The original box is unusable.As for the performance, it is a poor product, certainly not professional quality, and I have a feeling that I would need to replace this wheelbarrow soon. It certainly will not be another Ames product"
2,Not Heavy Duty!,This was advertised as being 'heavy duty' for contractors. I believe they may have pulled the homeowner version and shipped to me. Handles are weak and supports are thin. This is a $49 wheelbarrow.
5,A Must-Have for African-American Researchers,Tony Burroughs provides myriad of valuable information that all African-American genealogists need. Beginners and experienced researchers alike can benefit from this informative read.
4,Two classic Fox musicals make pleasant listening.,The combination of CENTENNIAL SUMMER - a Jerome Kern hit with an Oscar-nominated score and - STATE FAIR -R&H's only score written directly for film (six songs resulting in an Oscar Nom for Original Score and an actual OSCAR for BEST SONG)- are a wonderful pairing. The sound is not great but we are talking pre-high fidelity. The STATE FAIR songs are well-performed and scored. A more interesting album would be to combine this soundtrack with the 1962 Dot Records track of the remake.
5,Bought this vanity as a Christmas present for my daughter,"We're very happy with it. It was packed very well, very easy to put together, and our daughter loves it!"
2,Poor e-book editing.,"The book is well written enough but the ebook text itself has frequent patches of unreadable gobbledygook, sometimes greater than a paragraph in length. Very distracting and those unreadable portions are lost to the reader."
4,The College Student's Research Companion,"I found this to be a valuable resource. it has cut my time down when doing research projects. It contains a lot of useful information, especially for those just returning to college. i would consider it useful if you are interested in getting to the information you need without wasting time."
5,Marine band Harmonica's/ Bluesband (hohner),"Hello, just some facts for others looking to make a purchase. I currently own a set of hohner ""bluesband"" harps. Great for beginners. Cheap set that sounds great, with a variety of 7 different harps. one for each regular note, with the exception of B, being in flat. If you're starting off, get this set instead. Same price as one of a better harp, but after playing you'll know which key's you prefer. That being said, get a marine band after you decide which key's to upgrade. I've a G I've had for a few years now, still sounds amazing, easy to slide, and financially sound."
2,Trying to Correct a Problem,"Been having problems with the sound of 2 different Hohner Marine Band Harmonicas, Keys of C & G, both sounded too high and tiny. Tried buying this one in the Key of A, but that wasn't the problem. It was the Marine Band sound and 2 bad reeds. Bought an older type of Hohner Harmoncia, in the Key of C, it sounds great and is much easier to play."
1,glare on plastic makes viewing impossible,My husband bought this for my bicycle so I could use it as an odometr(Marathon) but the plastic over it causes way too much glare during the day which makes it useless. Would not recommend.
4,Entertaining and Educating,"My wife and I picked up this book in 2004 during our first visit to the Louvre. We have shared it with our young sons in the three years since, and recently our oldest son (7 yrs, bright kid) has started picking it up and reading it to us and to his younger brother (4 yrs). I am thrilled, as it gives them an intro to the world of art, using some of the finest examples from the Louvre (Winged Victory, Mona Lisa, and some that are lesser-known to the general public). You can tell that the text was translated from the French to English, but the translation is well done and accessible, and is written for a pre-high-school age level. Not too long, not too short--probably about a 10-15 minute read. Great photos, with captions explaining the title of each work of art, the artist, and the year created (ranges provided for BC-era sculpture from Mesopotamia, Egypt, etc)."
3,"Funny and cute, but be wary","This little book is cute and funny and will entertain you and your family for about five minutes. It has nice, clear images. However, there is an image in this book that most parents probably will not find suitable for children."
1,Introduction for Beginners,"Not what I expected from the previous reviews, it delivers few good new ideas and for someone who is used to extract the useful information from books, I found little to write out, I summarized the whole 160 pages into less than 2 !. Most of the topics are general recommendations with no techniques to use. Definetly not recommendable for experienced Speakers. The kind of litterature used reminds me of women talk where one simple idea is stretched into a half hour conversation ! There's no Chapters in the book and the Information is not structured, you could open any page and start reading !"
2,A Bit Surprising,"I have read many of Stokes' books and have fallen in love with her writing and characters. This book follows the lives of four college roommates through a journal that is passed between them for thirty years. Typical Stokes format, but the similarities stop there.I have come to associate Stokes' writing with the Christian fiction genre. With few exceptions, I read only Christian fiction so the lesbian story line caught me off guard. I kept expecting Stokes to address the issue from a Biblical standpoint, but it never happened. Also, the profanity was completely out of line with what I have previously read of Stokes' writing. The book had ample opportunity for spiritual growth of the characters, but Stokes chose this time to let the pieces fall where they may. I will be more careful when selecting the next Stokes book."
1,disappointed also,"i too was greatly disappointed with this book, i feel it fell far short of the standards set by her other writings, of which i have read most. neither did i appreciate the swear words contained in this book. don't buy it"
3,Motivation to Be Real,"Four women learn (the hard way) that transparency with true friends leads to intimacy. In spite of the pain, the joys of intimate friendships are worth everything. Stokes tells the stories of 30 years of secrets in these college friends' lives; I could identify with parts of all their stories."
1,Not Christian fiction,"I have enjoyed many of Penelope Stokes' books until I read ""Circle of Grace"". I often recommend books to my avid reading friends but this book will not be one of them. Although it is classified as Christian fiction, some of the content clearly was not. I was disappointed to find offensive language, subtle references to a lesbian relationship, and references to a distant deity with no clear message of a personal relationship to Him. This is improper for Christian Fiction and would be better classified as regular Fiction. The plot would have been just as good, if not better, without these things. Christian fiction needs to be honoring to Christ in content. I hope that this will not become the pattern for Penelope's future writings or I will no longer be able to recommend her."
2,Let down,Stokes let me down on this one. I didn't have the same feeling of the love of God and others as in her previous novels.
3,Not Up to Standard,"Having read all of Penelope Stokes' previous writings and proclaimed myself a fan, I find I must recend that status. While the story line wasn't all that bad, I was disappointed that some of Ms. Stokes' previous attention to the spiritual applications for her characters was missing. There were allusions, but no depth, no open statements of faith and/or guidance in that direction which I have found in her previous books and characters. I notice that she is no longer publishing w/ the publisher of her first books - could there be an element of compromise here? I am about to read her recently released novel and hope to find better fare and a re-focusing which I missed in Circle of Grace."
2,Too slow in developing the characters.,"Good idea for story line . However, too slow in developing the characters well."
1,not happy with this heater.,I am not happy with this heater. I needed to replace the wick not even after 2 months of part time use. This was a first for me and I have been using k.heaters on and off for years to help heat my home in the winter.Edited to update.I ended up giving this away. It would not heat evenly and the wick was constantly giving me issues. I am very disappointed with this product. I do not recommend.
4,Heater works just like I hoped it would.,"Heater is very nicely made. Their company's technical support was very helpful. I would recommend this heater to my friends. I originally bought this unit for emergency power outage use but am now using it to heat a 750 square foot, uninsulated, 2 and a half car attached garage. I fire it up early and wait long enough (5 minutes) to make another flame hight adjustment, then go back in the house ... you've got to give it some time to heat up that much cold air. A half to 1 hour later it's already helping to take the edge off nicely. I would have given it 5 stars except that, I had to reinstall the wick to get the flame within the proper range of operation."
4,Nice heater warms up quickly,"It is very easy to start, runs 8-12 hours on a tank of kerosene. And like others have commented, the handle can be problematic. It is not that it is flimsy as others have said, the problem is it slips out of the holes. I also spent 30 minutes trying to figure out what the wick was. It does come with one, just trust me on that. The directions didn't have a very good picture of what it look liked, but it was installed."
4,seems to work,"As others have stated the handle assembly is a bit flimsy but the heated works correctly. I haven't used it much yet so this winter will be the test.Update,I have run approximately 10 gallons per week through this this winter so far. I am very pleased, it has performed flawlessly. It produces a lot of heat with little odor from the kerosene and will run 7-9 hours on a filling (probably because it is not easy to completely fill it to the same level every time). I am still using the original wick that came with it and it will last through this winter without changing."
5,A monument to the unknown scientist,"By showing the truth behind some of the most famous discoveries in the history of science, John Waller pays a tribute to the countless unknown hardworking people who made these discoveries possible. In this well-documented and highly entertaining book, the reader is repeatedly shown that: 1) science seldom progresses through the sudden insights of geniuses, but is a continuous process; 2) as in other fields of human activity, some scientists got a credit they did not deserve, while others were unjustly ignored. This book is a must to everybody who is interested in the history and the ethics of science."
3,Essentially a history book,"There's nothing really revisionist about this book, it's essentially a history book. If you ever do science, you know that the data are messy, and sometimes you have to smooth over the results to fit the theory.Disclaimer: I've not read the book yet, but have ordered it and will update this review if the facts do not support the above thesis.Further, this is a 300 page book, not an 800 page book (the description is a typo)"
3,burnchester hall,"I got the idea to read this book when I met Dominic Mieville on world book day,and so I read it. The best partof the burnchester hall was when I read the first page because I like the way that he told the story and introduced the characters.I didn't like it when they first got underground because I nthought it was a bit scary."
4,On Death and Letting Go,"Like so many others, I did not want to read or think about death. Ellen Tadd's book changed that. One short sentence has remained with me ever since I read the book: ""Light dispels darkness"" (74). Recalling my reactions, even as I led up to that sentence, my thinking was being transformed to embrace death as an extension of life. In a strange way, I was comforted while I read. Vague childhood recolletions surfaced, how then (and now), I would suppress the onset of an out-of-body experience,or silence the voice of my deceased parents who wished (wish?) to talk with me. If anything, Ms. Taddd account has stregthened my belief in eternal life, moreso in reincarnation. I thank her for enhancing my understanding of the life/death marriage anad their intrinsic love."
4,A Good Read,This is a difficult book to summarize. I enjoy reading others' perspecitves and it made me think about things differently. People think about and experience death in different ways. This is just one approach to dealing with death as a natural process. I found it very interesting. I liked this book and gave a copy of it to my sister after our mother passed away.
3,sticky issue/E-A-S-Y reading,"DEATH AND LETTING GO was light and easy-does-it reading. I found myself smiling and nodding. This book would be good introductory reading for someone who is not-so-comfortable with the subject matter.For individuals more interested in hard, brass-tack reading, I'd suggest DEATHING: AN INTELLIGENT ALTERNATIVE FOR THE FINAL MOMENTS OF LIFE by Anya Foos-Graber. Like the saying goes, ""When the student is ready the teacher appears."" Ellen Tadd is a good teacher for people who are having a hard time even thinking about reading a book about death. Ms. Tadd is tender, a good storyteller, and her book is as pretty as they come. Foos-Graber is a good teacher for those who are well on their quest...people who are ready to study hard."
4,over 200 photos,"this large coffee table book is filled with wonderful photos of all the Navies of the world , illustated with the maps charts and flags it is a great read for anyone who's passion is ships."
5,Fantastic,"I read Lyudmila Ulitskaya's books in Hungarian, and was glad to see that some of her works have been translated into English. Medea and Her Children was fantastic, although not as good as Daniel Stein, Translator which, at this point, is still not available in English. I highly recommend reading it. But make sure that you read Daniel Stein when it becomes available. (Spring 2011). Her other works in English are also worth reading."
1,"I'm sorry, but...","...this is surely the most b o o r i n g book I have ever read. (And I am 60 and average a book a week.) Unless your life is extremely hectic and you read to help you fall asleep, this book is not for you either."
4,An underated classic,"Tawatha Agee may not be well known outside the R&B circle, but she is truly an underated talent. Achieving her first real known fame with Mtume with ""Juicy Fruit"", she released this debut solo album in 1987. The first release ""Thigh Ride"" was a juicy, provocative song that didn't get the airplay and attention that it deserved. ""Did I Dream You"" was the second release that got even less attention. Overall, this is a great album that is really hard to find, and is really worth listening to."
4,Tape,"I agree with the other person. A little bit of tape takes care of the problem of the lid opening. The lid coming open is a problem ALL hamster balls have. If you just put a small piece of tape maybe two, across the seam of where the lid and ball go together, it prevents the lid from turning and opening up during use. I have had no problems since I've started doing this. These are fun toys for your hamster. I recommend a hamster ball to anyone who owns a hamster."
5,Best Pirates action figure,This is one of the best Pirates action figures I have come across. It looks a lot like Johnny Depp and comes with several accessories.
4,Careful....,"The figure is highly detailed. My only caution to buyers is when moving the arms. The way that Jack's jacket is designed, moving the figure's arms places pressure on the plastic joints and care must be used or the arms will break off. The plastic joints are not very strong. I say this from experience, both of Jack's arms broke within the day and I've since superglued them in place......"
4,Talamadh 1,"I must say that I really enjoyed this book. I started reading it with skepticism. I was judging a book by it's cover. I was expecting a lack of original style, which in actuality, I was probably right. Nonetheless, the book was written beautifully and wouldn't let me put it down. I never read the copyright when I had it, so I thought it was an older book. I was looking everywhere for the sequel to this book, but then I finally discovered that it hasn't been published yet. I'm relieved somewhat to hear this, because I was afraid that they weren't going to print the sequel due to lack of sales or something of that nature. I'm definitely looking forward to the sequels and will most definitely read them."
4,mostly it is very good,"I bought this DVD for KD Lang doing Hallelujah, one of the finest female vocal performances of all time, and I'm not even a huge KD Lang fan! I was a little disappointed that it's not in 5.1 surround sound which it was when it was broadcast on Dish Network. It's only Dolby Digital 2.0 (stereo) but still sounds very very good!"
1,wish i could use zero stars,this was to be my christmas gift for my mom and it took us about an hour to realize it won't play...anywhere in america! i'm mad...
2,Christian-biased book,"The author is not suitable to write on Greek Love, since he is miserably infected by religious superstition. In the latter half of 20 th century C.E. , he anachronically believed paiderastia was unnatural."
3,You will take your lumps...,"It's an okay helmet for kids, but for adults, even adding the face guard, it's kind of a joke for anything past the TKD/Karate type sparring. I teach a Krav Maga class, full of gymnasts and parkour students, and this helmet leaves lumps when people throw hard, chopping strikes. As far as knees and kicks to the head go, forget it, I use real tactical helmets.This is a helmet for recreational training only, not for real tactical striking."
2,Not Impressed!!!,I bought these loppers based on the positive reviews here. These things are goofy to use with this ratching system. My family had a landscaping company for years and went thru a bunch of loppers and these are probably the worst I've ever used. Maybe it's just the ratching system that I'm not used to but I wouldn't recommend these loppers.
3,Lopers need muscles,I am hoping they work better after they are broken in because now they do not properly ratchet at every opening stroke.
1,Handle bent on 2nd use,Neat concept but this is not a heavy duty lopper. In order to telescope the handle is hollow. Both handles bent on the 2nd use. Add a little cash and get something better.
4,BRANCH TRIMMING W/ EASE,"This yard tool is a must, especially if you're not highly arm-muscled. Though the ratchet part had it's positioning problems, it wasn't too difficult to deal with, and still these are the easiest loppers I've used."
4,Toro Loppers,"The appearance of the Toro Ratcheting Lopper is excellent. When using it, it seems a little loose, not as heavy duty as I would expect of a Toro product. Quality would probably be better if made in the USA; the price was definitely for a higher quality product. Since it is functioning ok, I won't return it, but won't buy another Toro gardening tool product."
3,Know them both,"Have known Joe Grotto, owner of Joe's Grotto, for more than a decade. Have known Carvin Jones for almost two decades. Saw him today. Will be posting today's performance at [...]. You MUST see Carvin play. Those NOTES he's playing - he strums like a rhythm guitar and dampens (with his left had) the strings he's not playing so he only plays notes, not chords. Very unique style."
5,This is such an awesome book!,"I've just finished reading this and it's just a gem! These are beautiful life lessons in how to become better people, and to help us find peace in our lives. The author speaks to us in ways we easily understand. It's a beautifully written book and I highly recommend it to people from all faiths!"
5,On Earth as it is In Heaven is a wonderful delight,"On Earth as it is In Heaven is wonderfully uplifting. The concept of bringing Heaven into our lives here on earth by reflecting on the parables of Jesus is inspiring. Rev. Woofenden's insights are gentle on the soul. Yet they challenge the mind to probe deeply to do the necessary spiritual work so that the earth may indeed be more like Heaven, and that we may be more like angels. I enjoyed On Earth as it is In Heaven immensely and have purchased several more copies to send out to friends and spiritual seekers."
2,"A Lord of the Rings Type Story, Not Romance","I thought this book was terrible. From the bizarre names, leaders, etc. I felt like I was reading a Lord of the Rings war book. This was not like Medeiros' other books. This book is long too. Way too long. The story drags on and on, battle after battle. The main character Conn likes his foster daughter, then doesn't, he's attracted to her, then he's not. Zzzzzzz. I could only last 2/3 of this book before I gave up. Not worth reading."
2,Disappointed,"Started off enjoying this book, kept waiting for it to get better, but kept getting worse. The storyline just seemed to disintegrate, like the author was grasping at straws or in a hurry to finish a book she really had no ending for.When Conn turns on Gelina on their wedding day (isn't he supposed to love this woman?)for supposedly killing Nimbus (someone she truly cared for and was her friend), without so much as a why or explantion of motive, is the time I really got disgusted with the book. From then on, bad became worse and the ending finally killed what could have been a very good story.I can't see how anyone can rate this book with 5 stars - 2 is being overly generous."
1,This was such a disappointment!,"After scanning prior reviews I can't believe we read the same book! I love Teresa Medeiros but if this was the first of her work I had read I probably wouldn't have read any more. The main characters are totally unredeaming! She sheds her vows of loyalty and undying devotion like she sheds clothing. I hate stories of faithless women. She pledges herself to Conn, betrays her brother, when the brother appears again, she betrays Conn, when she's sent back she forgets the brother etc. Conn is no better. He blames her for everything without explanation or trusting her in any way (not that she's trustworthy). Surely this isn't considered a romance! Maybe it got better, I couldn't finish the book. I totally dislike almost all the characters."
3,It was scary,"Although I enjoyed reading ""Lady of Conquest"", I could not get over the fact that the heroine was a homocidal maniac. I found it hard to understand why the hero kept forgiving her, bringing her back with him, and then assuming that she betrayed him every fifty pages. The chemistry between Conn and Gelina was very real, but their actions seemed very contradictory to what they thought and felt about each other. Medeiros has written some wonderful novels since ""Lady of Conquest"". If you are looking for a romance novel that will make you smile, read ""Nobody's Darling"" or ""Breath of Magic""."
2,"Very, very, very slow","I bought this book on the recommendation of Amazon and was so disappointed. After 150 pages I am still unable to ""get into"" the book. The plot is very predictable and is soooooo slow. I am going to donate this book to Amvets in hopes to at least get a tax deduction out of the money I spent on this borning book."
5,WONDERFULL!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS ONE GREAT BOOK. THE CHARACTERS ARE SO ALIVE!! IT HAS ALL THE GREAT INGREDIANTS, HATE LOVE LUST AND LOYALTY... DON'T MISS THIS ONE..."
5,Passionate and wonderful!,"I loved this book! I knew it was one of Medieros's earlier efforts so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I found it filled with all of the qualities I've loved about her newer books--delightful humor, whimsy, passion and a romance that is truly for the ages. It's one of my favorite books of the year!"
2,"HATE THE ""HERO""","I love most of her books, but what was up with this one. I know; it was one of her earlier ones....but still. This started off ok. But, the guy is old enough to be her grandad. He also, is a fool and a raper. Unless you want to read a sad book that breaks a strong willed women who gets ruined by her hero then by all means read this said story. It is entertaining, yet you want to throw the book, or flush it down a toilet once your done it. I have this to say to Conn- boys can be boys, men can't"
2,Ugh.,"I was disappointed with both the story and the characters. I normally enjoy Medeiros a lot - I couldn't finish this book. After the fourth part, I lost the will to read the book. >.< The characters weren't likeable, and I didn't feel any compassion towards either of them. Read some of her later books - you'll be put in a much better mood than this one evokes."
5,Favorite book!!!!,I Loved this book!!! It is my favorite Teresa Mediros book i found it very well writen and it made me cry and laugh. The relationship between Gelina and Conn was breathtakeing and this story shall remain in my mind forever! I re-read it every month! GREAT BOOK! I found this anything BUT a disapointment
2,Disappointing,"After reading Charming the Prince, Nobody's Darling and Whisper of Roses, I found Lady of Conquest a complete disappointment and did not even bother to finish it. I would not recommend this book unless you have nothing else to read."
2,What went wrong ?,Lady of Conquest starts off well but about a quarter way through the storyline goes to pot.
2,reluctantly drawn,"While Medeiros is my favorite writer of romance and generally excellent historical fiction, this book left me with a bad taste in my mouth and a fear of ever being as ""in love"" as these two characters. This book shows a classic example of a horribly abusive mean-spirited relationship. While these two could have had a good relationship, the choices they made and the truly intense hatred they show for one and other would make me want to end up far from seeing them written into a lasting love. I wouldn't wish their brand of love on my worst enemy. Violence reigns in their story. I would never reread it."
5,Wonderful!,"I loved this book. The writing was moving and evocative, the characters alive and very, very real. Yes, this is a bit different than the usual Medeiros book, but it's every bit as lush and compelling as her other works. Fabulous."
1,DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS SELLER,I ordered the Bemis super wick (#1041) and they sent me a Best Air wick that is not interchangeable. It will not work in my Bemis humidifier. I have attempted to contact the Buy it now store THREE TIMES to no avail. They were happy to take my money and in no hurry to correct their mistake.
2,Good but has to be replaced often,"I do not understand why the manufacturer positioned this unit as they did. The filter has to be replaced more often than expected, even using a humidifier conditioning solution, the top of the filter collects minerals and dries out. Being fair, I have to point out that I use well water on the unit."
5,"Early Flemish Painting - Frere, Jean-Claude","During the 15th century, in a small area of France known in modern days as Burgundy, there lived and worked a small group of exceptional painters. They created some of the very finest and most beautiful works of art ever made. The Van Eyck brothers, Rogier Van der Weyden, Robert Campin, and Hugo Van der Goes, among others, pioneered oil painting. Their work has never, (in my opinion), been surpassed. The paintings are beautifully reproduced in this book, the colors glow with rich intensity. Abandon all preconceptions! Open this book and radically alter your estimate of human creative potential!"
1,worst book i've ever tried to read!,i have always made it a practice to finish any book that i begin but i had to make an exception in this case. the author mainly focuses on politics and the workings of the canadian government instead of telling us about the marriage of joann and colin thatcher and joann's murder. there were so many people mentioned in the book and you had to read everyone's family history. boring!!!
5,"Sahara, Clive Cussler","This is one of Clive Cusslers' best! A great adventure, including treasure hunting, history, and a biological melt down. The movie, Sahara, which is an off-shoot based on this book, with a slightly different twist, is incredible as well. With Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, Rudy Gunn and Colonel Sandecker, you can't go wrong with this one."
4,SAHARA by Clive Cussler,I thought the movie was very action filled. But I am so glad I decided to read the book. There is so much more action adventure in the book and you always find out what the people are thinking. I would recomend this book to my friends.
2,Recent Book Purchase,"Book was listed in ""mint condition"". The dust jacket was in mint condition, but the spiine of the book was dented and the pages appeared old."
2,You get what you pay for...,"Haven't read the paperback yet because I bought a used paperback and it was really used...pages following out made it too tough to carry around (prime feature of paperbacks).So, I've ordered a new paperback of this book and will be very careful about purchasing used books again."
2,give me a break,"Okay, action/adventure isn't my cup of tea, but I found the basic idea of this book laughable. I'm an archaeologist and this isn't archaeology. Cracked me up! I'm also very intersted in Civil War history and the idea that a Civil War submarine crossed the Atlantic and ended up in Africa is positively ludicris. The only thing funnier is who was on the sub (I won't give it away and spoil your good laugh). And then Clive Cussler shows up in the middle of the African desert. The author also explains why Mary Todd Lincoln was crazy, funny, I thought it was because she was bipolar and lost her son and husband."
2,"Yeah right, don't waste your time......RENT THE MOVIE INSTEAD","This terrible book starts out with a stupid ship that dissappears.Other than that nothing good happens.Athought the battle abord the ship on the Niger River was pretty good, this book is a disappointment. I can't believe the author was able to draw out such a long and boring, and uninteresting piece of malarky. Don't even think about going out and looking at even the cover of the book, cause thats uninteresting to. The only reason that i would give this book 2 stars is because the movie was good. It had some humor, action and is interesting. Rent the movie, burn the book... Rent The Movie, BURN THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,A Novel Full Of Hot Air,"I wanted to try out another adventure writer other than the ones I've been reading. I thought I'd give Clive Cussler a try since I read Raise The Titanic.The setups in the beginning were long-winded and gave absolutely no relation to the story whatsoever till somewhere towards the end of the book. It served to confuse the readers greatly until strangely and coincidentally enough the Dirk Pitt chances upon them.The book is full of male bravado and machoism. It was shameless in the way Clive included himself into the novel as one of the characters searching for the lost ship. At the same time, the people who seem not to die or get injured miraculously is Dirk Pitt. Everyone else he knows dies.The plot itself was very round about, back and forth and linear. I hope the movie would prove a better watch. Otherwise, some interesting facts about survival in the Sahara that's about it."
3,A temporary letdown in the series,"I'm continually amazed at the enthusiasm for this novel, especially by those who have read other Dirk Pitt adventures prior to it. Unlike his other novels, Cussler never effectively ties in the historical incidents that begin the book to the main plot. He fails to pay off the subplot about the Confederate ironclad, except for using it as set dressing. Similarly, the aviatrix subplot is nothing more than a deus ex machina to rescue Dirk and Al from their predicament. Also, after the Cussler cameo in ""Dragon"", which made sense in the context in which it was placed, this one presents the first superfluous follow-up and the beginning of an unfortunate habit. All that aside, the story is generally exciting, with a very satisfactory comeuppance to the villain."
2,I wish it had stayed as good as it started,"This was my first Clive Cussler novel -- I have since read two others -- and this had the best potential. The historical story lines were very clever, but Dirk Pitt... he reminds me of the village lout Gaston in the Disney movie ""Beauty and the Beast.""The pace of the story was good, and the ending was pretty good, too. But Dirk Pitt distracted me from enjoying the book too much. I was very exasperated with the character.When I think about it, I suppose that means I was drawn in by the book enough to be irritated with the character. I have recommended this book to one of my friends, who got a big laugh out of it (he's the sort of friend who sees the lighter side of life).All in all, though, I was disappointed in the book."
4,sahara,"The story is packed full of suspense and adventure.The movie deviated from the book. The book version is far superior and offers more intrigue. The movie's character that plays Al Giordino is not anything like the book character. The book character is far more musclar, terrfic sense of humor and together provides the reader with this swash buckling team of adventures."
3,Between a rock and an odd place...,"I don't care for Clive Cussler or his writing style. I hate the way he interjects himself into the fiction, I dislike the arrogance I read into his writing... and yet I buy every Dirk Pitt book he writes. I can't even tell you why.Maybe it's because they ARE simply brain candy, exotic places, beautiful women, over the top adventures, I don't know. Maybe because the good guys always win... again, I'm not sure. I can't even bring myself to suggest you read Sahara.... but maybe you should. It won't change your life or your world or make you a better person, but it might help you pass a few hours without cluttering up your mind. Perhaps that's enough."
3,Fun book...not the movie plot at all,"This was fun to read. I didn't expect it to be anything like the movie and it wasn't, so I wasn't disappointed. I could care less about Mali so I didn't stress out about his characterization of it. I mean, you can't take this stuff seriously because he does say that the moon landing is a farce and that Stanton hated Lincoln (which was not exactly true, they had profound respect for each other).. So I just went along for the ride and had fun with it.It is what it is...this isn't a book that will be in the classics section of the library but it was easy to read and a nice break from my regular tome."
5,an absolute must!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is probably my favorite book now and I have read alot of books. If you like action this book is for u. The ending is incredible. Read it now.
2,Glad I Checked It Out From The Library,"I don't know what I find more incredible:That a man who claims to be a writer wrote this book,a publisher actually published it,readers actually paid for it.I have never seen more childish, adolescent prose in book published by a major publisher. It was so bad, I put it down around page 180, only kept going that long because I kept thinking ""There has to be something to this if this guy's so popular"".Some people who liked the books even though the writing is bad say the action sequences and descriptions of foreign countries make up for it. I disagree. The action was not believable and the descriptions are shallower than seeing a country from group tour bus window."
1,Thumbs Down,This book was awful I do not know how people can read thisgarbage it has a weak action adventure plot that has been overused bymovies and the publishing companys. The same Hero guy saves the damsel then the world has been around since the middle ages has gotten very boring. I have also read numerous other books by him that are maybe threes and fours but over all I just do not think that he is a good author.
3,Not as advertised,"If you are looking for a LARGE PRINT book, do not order this one. It is not LARGE PRINT even though it is claimed to be."
1,Printing is off,Several of the pages are off center. Either the center is cut off or the outer edge is cut off.
1,Lied about condition,I order a book that said it was USED- VERY GOOD. This books binding is very poor. The cover is bent. The book is not worth the money I paid for. I might try to get a return.
3,Adventure in the desert,"This is Clive Cussler, his books are far fetched, incredible and over the top. But they are also a lot of fun, if you adjust your expectations a little bit. They are adventure romps where the good guys (Mr Dirk Pitt in this case) can take anything and solve any riddle (and always get the girl in the process).Reading this will not increase your IQ or expand your literary horizons, but it will provide a few hours of entertainment.Most of Cussler books are similar, so if you must read one, Sahara is one of the best."
4,Quite the page-turner...,"I picked this book up as airline reading over the holidays, due in large part to the fact that a movie based on it was soon to be released. I had never read a Clive Cussler novel before and must say I am a new fan of his work. This is a great action adventure novel that kept me coming back for more. The only disappointment being the lack of strong, believeable female characters. I find it hard to believe that a woman who has risen to the position of Secretary-General of the UN would so casually spill government secrets to someone in the back of a limo, even if that person was a former lover. Additionally, the only adjective to characterize Dirk Pitt's love interest is pitiful. I am sure these disappointing characters will be fleshed out in the movie version, though, and they would not deter me from recommending this book for those looking for a quick and entertaining read."
2,Stretches your credulity to the breaking point,"Ever hear the phrase ""suspension of disbelief""? You'll need a truckload of it for this book. The story is entertaining enough; I can see why it was made into a movie. But you'll need to turn off the logical part of your brain as the invincible, superhuman Dirk Pitt achieves one utterly implausible escape after another.Cussler finally lost me when Dirk and his pal, after wandering in the Sahara Desert for days with no food or water, discover a crashed airplane and manage to rebuild it into a ""land yacht."" They ride it to safety and are restored to perfect health in moments after guzzling some water. Oh, please ...This was my first Clive Cussler novel, and I suspect it will be my last."
1,Can anything be so bad?,What a waste of time. Cussler's Dirk Pitt is the most ridiculous character ever.
5,Dirk Pitt - What James Bond really wants to be like!!!,"Sahara was my first Dirk Pitt adventure and what an adventure it turned out to be. As a result of Clive Cussler's ability to maintain several plots that bear no possible connection, I was unable to put this book down. Only to my surprise and Cussler's cleaver imagination, were all the plots able to come together so cleanly and without a hitch. The only problem with this book is that now I question my own belief of history. What is truth and what is fiction? A must book for anyone!"
3,audio massacre,"This is a classic Dirk Pitt action novel, but, the audio version is so heavily abridged that large parts of the plot are missing. Stick with the print."
4,Another great from the Dirk Pitt collection.,"This was the first of Clive Cusslers adventures and I am pleased to say that I now own the whole collection to date. From start to finish the way he ties the plots and seperate incidents togeather show the true talent of thiw writer. There are several little adventures that when concluded only lead on to another which leaves you exhausted by the end. I would recommend this to any Cussler fans or anyone who likes an adventure book, it is not for everyone though. Thanks Clive and keep them coming."
1,I love a good adventure tale...,"..but this is not a good one. I can't believe people read this guy's books for enjoyment (escape?). I was going on a camping/hiking trip recently and this book was given to me to 'enjoy' at the campsite. The only enjoyment came when I used it to light fires each night. Luckily, I did bring some other paperbacks that were much better and did survive to pass on to other campers. If you have never read this guy's books, beware. They should probably be required reading in beginner-writing classes as examples of how NOT to write!"
2,I don't know how I feel about this one.,"I don't know how I feel about this one. I enjoyed reading it in the same way I might enjoy watching whatever made-for-tv movie might be playing on USA on a random weeknight. My main complaint about the book was its totally bad way of giving information by way of really bad exposition. Most authors seem to be able to reveal things in a clever way that comes naturally in the story.Often it is the equivelant of writing a character who comes out and says ""It's good to have you home; I see that you have sucessfully driven to work and accomplished your tasks there. By the bag in your hand I can tell that you have gone to the store and purchased the bananas, tomatoes, and pie crusts that we needed."""
2,D-uh.....Uh......UHH!!,"I've read three of this guy's books- an easy task as they can be smoothly read, but they are also almost interchangeable- the plot seems to be identical once places and names are removed. This is a good book to read while watching T.V. or over a 2 or 3 hour transit round-trip when you can only give part of your concentration to a novel (Like on a summers day, when the other part of a man's concentration, in all probability, would be focused on your scantly clad neighbours)"
4,A very good book,"This is my first time reading a Clive Cussler novel and I loved it!! Yeah there is romance in there but not so much to make you gag and the action is just superb! Dirk and Al are quite the team: strong, intelligent, and humorous.There is the too much detail thing. My English teacher always says there is no such thing as too much detail. And well I think Mr. Cussler just proved her wrong with that. But anyways it became such a drag with so much detail but I still love the book and the movie for that matter. But they just dont seem to parallel; they just collide. But that's okay because I still like them anyways."
3,Fun read,I received this as a gift a while back. Found it to be a fun read. Short stories sometimes by state. Some chapters are just a page or two. Great read for teens to adult. Would be good for a camping trip to read around the campfire.
3,If you read only one True Haunting book...,"...then you could do a lot better AND a lot worse. At a hefty four hundred and sixty pages long, Hans Holzer's Haunted America offers enough allegedly true ghost stories to spice up any number of campfire yarns. The tales range from heartwarming to horrifying, yet not one story achieves a feeling of verisimilitude. They're just good material for spooky stories to tell. Save for one tale that relates how a family in Tyler, Texas suffered the attentions of a supposed poltergeist. Holzer's clear bias towards a there having to be supernatural explanation undermines what little objectivity he claims to have. Other than that one story, the book is entertaining if taken in small enough doses."
1,I wanted to poke my eyes out,"Let me start by saying I did not read this entire book. In fact I read less than 20% of it(I skimmed through the rest). The reason is, this book was so boring and dry I wanted to shoot myself after the first few pages. If you are a science nut or a math wiz, you may enjoy this book. If you are looking for a good, easy to read book giving evidence for intelligent design - look elsewhere. I recommend The Case For A Creator by Lee Strobel or The Origin Of The Universe by Emerson Cooper. I have read them both and they are both much better than this book.Bottom Line: Save your time and money and buy something else."
4,Star Cookie Tree Kit,"Cookie cutters are good size, instructions easy to follow. I have a sugar cookie recipe from ""Betty Crocker's Cookie Book"" that I like better though. Although the recipe included in the kit instructions is not bad, by any means."
4,Cute tree,I made this Cookie tree for a Christmas party this year. It turned out really cute and received lots of compliments. It wasn't too complicated to make and came with easy to follow instructions. But it is extremely time consuming if you only have 1 oven. I didn't care for the enclosed sugar cookie recipe. But all in all I'm happy with my purchase.
2,Over Priced,The product was very good; just what I wanted. However; it was bad enough that the vendor charged double what the manufacturer priced it at but to add $10.00 to ship it was too much. I will not be ordering anything more from this vendor. Amazon should be more aware of this type of gouge.
5,new holiday staple,"This Cookie tree was a huge hit. I made it twice this year and it turned out great both times. Cutting out and decorating the stars turned into a great activity for the kids (ages 7, 5, and 2.5). Even better, the Wilton cookie recipe is really tasty. We will make this again and again in years to come."
5,A view on preservation of our fishing,"Mr. Wigan is an excellent writer (see his The Highland Estate) who is concerned for the natural resources of the sea. He researched many situations about fishing and overfishing including the decline of the Gulf Coast Redfish (Red Drum) due to overfishing by commercial fishermen and how this sad situation was changed by forward looking men and laws that have now led to a resergence of this game fish. He has many other examples, but this is the one with which the Americans should be most familiar. The book is well written and deserves a reading by those who are interested in the sea and its riches."
5,So glad I can visit the cement ship anytime I want!,"I hope to be able to visit the cement ship for a long time to come. Having the good fortune to live in Seacliff and being personally involved with the person who was responsible (Rose Costa) for having the cement ship refurbished after the floods of 82-83 is a great honor. Unfortunately, Rose passed away last year and the ship is in need of repair again. The state parks have no money, so they say, and I am trying with other people (Friends of Rose) to pick up where Rose left off. The book was delightfully enlightening of the S S Palo Alto's history!"
1,What Happened to the Rao's recipe,I have always been a fan or Rao's Marinara sauce and willing to shell out the premium price of $7-$9 a bottle. However of late (I would say within the last 3-6 months) the recipe or process has apparently changed. The sauce is no where near as fresh tasting as it once was. The sauce is now more homogenized and bland to the point that I will no longer shell out the premium price for a product that is no better then sauces selling for $2 a bottle. It is sad that the company has cut corners in the way that they have (perhaps they have expanded production and are using a new supplier). I hope that they return to their original recipe or drop the new manufacturing source.Considering the price point and the average quality I would rate the current product as poor.I would be interested in other opinions.Sign me an unhappy customer.
1,OK unless U have read other marketing books,"Nothing new just repackaging of basic marketing concepts. Wake up!! Women r no different. They want a good deal too just like men do.Price it low & give good service. No Bull, just good service"
1,What do Two Old Ladies Know About Selling Cars??,"All fluff and no stuff! What a waste of paper. I ask again--what do two old ladies know about selling cars to women, men, etc.? Answer: NOTHING.Marketing is an art and a science, a discipline these two old crows do not understand and they have the nerve to write a book--what next?? Suggest they leave the marketing to those with a background, basis and understanding of the subject. Further, suggest they leave marketing to women to some real women and men who understand the topic--the fact that you are two old ladies is not a qualifying factor.Get a real job and stop writing these waste of time booksThis Book is a BAD read--I mean really bad"
1,Price it low--there's no magic,"How to sell cars to anyone, male or female: price the car low, give good service and treat the customer right. With the internet, everybody has the same info, most people buy the car from the lowest price dealer--dah!This book is not worth your time. Instead if you really are going to perseverate on this topic (which I believe is falacious, because selling cars to women is no different than selling to any other group) READ PATRICK DAVIS'S book. At least the Davis book makes some sense, provides tips (for selling to anyone) and is an easy read.Forget about MaddoxSyme book--the only thing this book demonstrates is that these 2 know nothing about cars and even less about selling cars. I give this an F on all counts."
4,Murder and mayhem in a B & B,"This is the first in a series of Bed and Breakfast Mysteries by Mary Daheim. In this book Judith McMonigle, a middle-aged widow, has started a bed and breakfast. Eager to fill up her reservation book, Judith plays hostess to the Brodie family, a collection of eccentric characters whose house is being fumigated. They invite a fortune teller as ""entertainment"" for their weekend, and when the fortune teller dies, she is found to have many connections with different members of the family. During the murder investigation, Judith becomes reacquainted with an old flame who is now a police investigator. She, of course, deduces the killer before her former boyfriend, action which may not qualify him as a future boyfriend. This is fun, light reading, in the ""cozy"" genre."
2,Not the best for a cozy,"I will not continue reading this series. The characters were not endearing to me, and the writing was choppy. To be honest I struggled through it. At one point I wanted to put it down, but I kept on because I rally wanted to find out who the murderer was. When the murderer was revealed, it was such a let down. The description of what really happened was just plain boring.I cannot recommend this book. I found it a waste of my time, and I really hate that I did not get if from the library to try it out. Such a disappointment considering I was looking foward to a good bed and breakfast cozy mystery."
5,A Culinary ad Readerly DelightReviewer: Renee S. N.Y.C.,"Just discovered this series of cozies, and after having read the first one, I am eager to go on to the rest. I liked the not-Seattle setting and thought the characters of Judith and Renie were hilarious. Maybe that is because I AM ""of a certain age"" (one reviewer I read had trouble relating), but I thought these feisty ladies were sharp, vibrant and a hoot. The mystery wasn't bad eitther, and honestly enough plotted that you could figure out who the murderer was, if you picked up on all the clues. In our present culture of youth, it was nice to see a story in which the formerly young still had a place in the world. This book was a delight, and I do recommend it."
1,Not so great,"I've been trying to get into this series and it's just not working. I've read other books in the series also and Judith and Renie have driven me crazy. They are annoying and nosy. The books jump all over the place and the final solutions just don't come together that well. The storyline and characters are just not that intriguing, I'm not even going to finish the last one I started."
3,Rather Hard On The Senses,"Unfortunately, this book is about two middle-aged women who think being rude, most often for no apparent reason, can pass for wit. The mean-spirited sarcasm wares on you, making you not care about them in the end."
2,What a disappointment,"Being a big fan of B&Bs, I was excited to delve into this mystery series....and was extremely disappointed. I thought the plot was too slow, the suspects too numerous, and the humor too non-existent. I felt like I was in the middle of a poorly written B-movie, with all of the suspects gathered around the table, and I had to guess which stereotype best fit the bill as the murderer. Plus, I am not a fan of the cranky relative bit that seems to be popluar. Her mother was not charming and funny - just annoying.Unfortunately, I purchased the first 8 in the series, on the recommendations of other readers. Now I'm sorry I didn't read this one before I bought the rest!"
1,Were fun reads ONCE...........,"I really liked this series at one time, back when they were fun to read. But, the premise the writer depends on now is lacking anything worth the time to read it. They are just RE-hashed over and over and getting totally absurd now. You would think a series would improve with time, NOT so with this one."
3,"Nice, but...","While I can't fault Ainslie's playing (it's really good), the singing just sounds contrived. Not to sound racist, it just sounds weird to have a white voice trying so hard to emulate a black one. It just doesn't do it for me. If you want to hear these songs, listen to them as recorded by the original artist. The diddley-bow playing is interesting but only goes so far - there's just so much you can do with one string.My hat goes off to Mr Ainslie for trying this hard, but I'd rather hear an album of instrumentals or originals sung in his ""natural"" voice.""Terraplane"" gets three stars due to his excellent guitar work."
4,COMMON PLOT,"We have all seen horror movies of similar plots from Texas Chainsaw to 2001 Maniacs. This one was done better than most. First I would like to give kudos to Scott Rockenfield who provided us with an exceptionally great and original soundtrack of both rock and blues. I would also say that the supporting cast outside of the 4 main characters did an excellent job, especially the guy with the twitch. Now as for the plot...Could we leave out the ""we didn't pack a spare tire for the beer cooler"" routine? It doesn't work. Instead make the spare tire flat. It accomplishes the same thing without making everyone look stupid. So how is it the gas station run by a blind guy had the exact same tire and rim, already inflated and balanced sitting out behind country service station? The slasher part needed to be better. A little Rob Zombie type action would have fit in at this point. From here the movie goes from 4-5 stars to 2 stars, just above an Asylum movie."
3,Good but not as good as SLS,"This CD is good and in the same style as their previous band, something like silas. But I miss the voice of the woman in it. It doesn't has the magic as SLS did."
4,This stuff is pretty good,I got 2 bottles of this for my volkswagen jetta which requires 75w90.When i did a fluid change I noticed right away a smoothness in my shifting which was impressive. The only problem is as soon as winter peaked around the corner my shifting got very rough on initial startup. after the engine warms up i am good to go. I will be switching to a new brand name and to one with a heavier oil. I believe this is a pretty good oil I just don't think it is the right one for my car.
2,Messy and ugly,I purchased this belt and tested for color fastness when it arrived against blue jeans .... left discoloration on the jeans ... this is not a pretty pink color ... the color shown on the page is actually nicer than the color of the item.
4,Girl gear pink tool belt,"I recently purchased the GirlGear pink toolbelt for a gift for my best friend who just completed a beautiful deck, singlehandedly at age 56! I also bought the pink hard hat and protective glasses and she looks terrific wearing all three. The toolbelt is a great design with lots of space for tools. It's heavy duty leather and looks like it will last a long long time. The only (slight) negative is that the hyperdying to make it pink also creates some pink residue on work clothes (assuming this will stop with wear) so wear your old work jeans or dark pants.A great product and well made."
3,okay,Has everything I'm looking for in a tool belt but i'll have to make some adjustments to the waist size. I'd give it 5 stars if I could make it about 5 inches smaller. I'm just going to have to make some adjustments to it myself because other tool belts are designed for men and so they're just plain huge. The pockets are just the right length and I'm happy with everything but the waist size. I'll update if I notice any bleeding but most of the pants I wear when I do need a tool belt are black so I doubt I'll be posting anything about the issues with color bleeding.
4,Girls Tool Belt,I ordered this toolbelt for my little sister for Christmas this year. When I received it I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. My husband even gave it a try to see how it held up compared to the size of his. He thought it would be a good size for what she is doing with it (some minor remodeling). Hope she likes it.
3,Turns your clothes pink,"I like the concept of this belt. I like the layout of the pockets and the smaller size of the belt. However, the pink dye in the suede turned my clothes pink. Maybe I was a little sweaty and the moisture released the dye - I can't say for sure. My solution was to duct tape the back of the pockets where they touched me.The pockets in this belt aren't huge and I quickly realized that I needed more space for all of my tools and accessories. For the casual user, this would probably be large enough, but I was renovating an entire house with my husband as our full time job."
4,Awesome Pink Tool Pouch,"My boss's little grandaughter, Taylor, is a real tomboy. Her Pappy Jim, is an electrician and owns our company. He was babysitting one day during Spring Break and she decided she must have a tool belt like all the other electricians. She did however insist hers must be pink. They came back to our office and my co-worker Skeet, opted to purchase this pink tool bag for her. She was thrilled and will make great use out of it.Thanks Again,Karen @ D&J; Electric"
5,Gift,We gave this away as a birthday gift and she was very pleased at the way it looks and the construction.
3,A story of the mysterious disappearance of Roanoke Colony,"The book is set in the New World on an island. This book tells a story about a girl named Virginia Dare, who was the first English child born in the New World. Her mother died when she was five, and then she was adopted by an Indian woman who renamed her Ulalee. When she was grown, she was the prettiest girl. Every man wanted to marry her, but she only fell in love with one, whose name was Okisko. On their wedding day, her adoptive father said Ulalee had already been spoken for by Cipo, the ugly medicine man. Ulalee and Okisko decided to run away from Cipo, but they forgot he was a powerful medicine man. They also had forgotten how mad they had already made him.This is a good book, but the real excitement starts in the middle. It is a nice short book and I would recommend it to people who like suspense and like to read."
2,Legend written in 1901,"The White Doe: The Fate of Virginia Dare was written by Sallie Southall Cotten in 1901. Mrs. Cotten was a very active woman in North Carolina history. Her book is written in the form of poetry and is available from an antique books website. It is my understanding that the legend of the white doe has been around for a very long time. I don't know if Mrs. Cotten was the first to write the white doe/Virginia Dare connection, but this is a very old story and I have discovered several versions in just brief browsing on the internet. One of John Jakes novels was based on an old book Johnny Tremain. I haven't read the book I am reviewing, but how much can one borrow from previous authors?The Legend of the White Doe"
5,I like this story!,I last read this book when I was nine but I have loved this story. I like the way the author comes up with explanations about what happened with the lost colonists. It mixes history and legend too.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this phone because it was highly rated by Consumer Reports, but so far I've been disappointed. I've been using it for a couple of weeks. I'm frustrated by the extraneous static/noise on the line from time to time. I am also having a problem where I dial a phone number to call someone, and nothing happens ... and I have to dial again. Thinking about returning it."
5,Great Phone,"I love my new AT&T E2116 cordless phone. It is easy to use, light weight and the letters and numbers are easy for me to read. Also, the ringer is loud enough for me to hear. Love it!"
2,Too bulky; low battery life,"I bought this to replace a GE phone. The phone and base are a lot bigger and bulkier than my old phone. The worst part is the batteries are bigger and heavier, but the life is only four hours and takes 16 hours to charge."
1,Product is no good,This phone does not work it fades in and out.It is not worth sending back I threw it in the garbage.
1,Doesn't work well,"The phone refuses to connect upon first hitting the talk button in response to a phone call. Then it makes a very grating noise before clearing up. And, for some reason, the caller ID will not display. Finally, everyone tells me not to use the speaker feature because my words are indecipherable. Other than that, the phone is fine . . ."
2,bad voice quality,"The voice quality on this phone is terrible. Whenever I call home from another location, I can hardly hear the person using this phone. It sounds like a bad long-distance call in the days of my childhood.The best feature, though, on this phone is the speaker phone. The volume is great for hearing the caller."
4,pretty good,"The phone, so far, seems to work well. The only minor problem is that the display screen is a little difficult to see."
1,Do NOT buy this phone!!!,"This is by far the worst phone we have ever owned. When we dial a phone number normally or press redial, it is apparently too quick for the phone to handle and the call doesn't go through. If you dial too slowly, you also get an operator message. It takes 3 or 4 times to dial most calls. Most recently when trying to dial out, I would dial a number, and the phone would connect me with a totally random number. Additionally, this phone has the clunkiest call-waiting signal we've ever heard. It is impossible for your conversation not to be totally disrupted with this overly long yucky sound. This phone has other bad features too: if a long distant caller phones, you can't automatically phone him/her back because there is no 1 in front of the number on the ID like with the panasonic phones. Save yourself the hassel and don't buy this phone!!!"
1,Never worked right,I stopped trying to call out after messing up for a week. It would never dial correctly. I have had AT&T before and they were fine. Do NOT buy THIS one.
2,Chain Dialing problem,"Please be aware that chain dialing is not supported in this phone.If you use a calling card for long distance calls, you will have to input the numbers MANUALLY. There is no way to access them from the phones memory while making the call. I had to return the phone..."
2,Poor Quality Phone,"In the past, I've been happy with AT&T phones, but this phone is really poor quality. I have to dial a phone number three or four times before it actually connects (this does not happen on any other phones in my house), and there is quite a bit of static heard during calls. I bought a hands-free plug-in ear piece to go with this, and the connection is horrible - it cuts out all the time! In general, I am very disappointed with this product. Spend a little extra money and get a better phone!"
4,Good telephone,For the money spent this is a good little telephone. The only drawback I find is that I have to enter numbers I am dialing slowly or else the call will not go through. Not a real problem since it causes me to slow down and probably dial more accurately. The sound it quite good--both incoming and outgoing.
4,good phone for the price,"paid about $30 for this phone. it does what it's supposed to. got good range and all. overall, not bad."
2,Rack System for mobile DJ,"I really think Gemini needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. The wheels on the rack system are way to small to handle anything put into the box, the frame started to come apart when installing the amp in the bottom. I had to go to Lowes just to get brackets and corner connectors just to keep it together."
2,Not Road ready,"Ordered this item from a seller on ebay. First one they shipped out was badly damaged. Second item was damaged, but I am trying to get seller to replace only the damaged parts. The key thing is that this ""ROAD"" case cannot even survive shipping empty. Gemini does a poor job of packaging it. Only a thin cardboard box wrapped around it. But then again it is suppose to be a Road case. I got it because the price was cheap. I would recommend you buy something better. Unfortunately that means at least twice the money.If you want something cheap, don't mind trying 3 or 4 times to get an undamaged item, and don't mind fixing it as needed then buy it."
5,"Not pretty, but functionally strong !","After years of the loose and flimsy, this product is strong, durable, relatively-silent, and easy to install and deploy. I paid less than $25. for it, but it is worth twice that."
4,Better Basketball,I bought this DVD along with the latest Better One on One Offense (which i highly recommend). This DVD gives you so many drills to practice and do that I have never even thought of! It shows you when to use the move and in what situation. I recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking to improve their ball handling!
5,Bad Movie! Go to your room!,"Every time you go to say ""What?"" Joel and the bots are there to make you laugh. The only thing I really didn't like about this episode is how ***SPOILER ALERT!!!*** it ends earlier than expected and Joel, the bots, and you are forced to watch a short at the end ***END SPOILER ALERT!*** Overall, a great Joel-hosted MST3K."
5,Smart and gutsy,"Elliott deserves huge credit for having the guts and smarts to expose the fuzzy nonsense handed out to us for years by the old aesthetic ed establishment. Even more, Elliott's philosophy makes perfect sense to real teachers who have to put the National Standards into practice because Elliott's book tells us why and how to make the Standards happen."
1,"Elliott's ""Old"" philosophy of music education","Since the publication of Bennett Reimer's third edition of A Philosophy of Music Education: Advancing the Vision, (2003) Elliott's book becomes passe. While Elliott single-mindedly advances music education as performance education, Reimer is inclusive of all the ways people enjoy music, and proposes a music education that is inclusive of the way music really is in our world. His is a brand ""new philosophy"" of music education, while Elliott's now seems dated and tired indeed. The reviews and ratings of Reimer's book are of the previous edition. Everyone who reads the third edition will find it revelatory -- a new way to conceive what music education has been and needs to be."
3,"A revision, not a sequel","While it was great to revisit the material in the first edition of this tome, I was expecting a little more. It's hard to imagine that there weren't enough iconic new houses built to justify another book, and there are certainly more than a few creations of the architects in the first volume to warrant another book. Instead, the authors have given us a revision of sorts, but not one that justifies its expense of production or cost to purchase. It's a pleasant read, but only at its remaindered price."
4,Good keyboard,"This is a great standard keyboard.I would have rather bought a wireless keyboard though. Also, the keys are sort of ""high"" for my liking. But still is a very nice keyboard, nothing wrong with it. It's really all about personal preference."
3,No Win 7,"I was seriously considering purchasing this keyboard. I contacted HP customer support and determined that this keyboard is NOT Windows 7 compatible. So...if you're interested in using it w/ this OS, it's not gonna work."
2,Took 2 to get a working one,"First one had non-responsive numeric keys.Second seems to work OK.Kind of mushy keys.Mediocre board, as are most these days."
2,ahhhh frustration,"First keyboard sent was not the one I ordered, second has a sticky hyphen that only works part of the time, but I couldn't send it back and be without a keyboard for yet another 2 weeks. Very frustrating experience.L."
3,Universal Stroller,"Good value for your money. But, accessibility to stowage area or basket is difficult once the infant seat is attached."
2,Didn't fit my carseat,It might be a nice stroller but it doesn't fit my carseat properly. I wish it more clearly explained what carseats it fits.
2,Strollee sucks,ProsCan carry around most car seats.Has triple fold for compactness.Looks niceConsPoor qualityRickety feel when turningwobbles left to rightBROKE WHILE IN USEI admit I used this product a lot but the top handle should not have snapped while strolling along in the mall.The metal part of the handle just snapped in half; there's no way to repair it.I had to carry the baby all the way back through the mall.Don't buy this.Kolcraft or Graco have similar items that have much better quality and underseat room.
3,not nearly as nice as the Combi Flash,this one is just ok...not compatible with nearly as many car seats as the Combi Flash. doesnt seem as durable and doesn't have the parent organizer. overall not too excited about this product
1,disappointing,i hated this book. At first i was excited to see this gorgeous warrior but at the end he just became annoying. I liked both characters at the beginnig but they became irritating. the heroin had like a pinkie sized scar on her cheek which she is constantly freaking out about. She also refuses to tell him about her father being held hostage even thought she obviously can't do anything about it and he obviously can help. At the beginning she is like this strong female character who has her opinions but at the end she basically just does whatever he tells her to do. I wouldn't recommend buying this book or reading it.
3,Tiger and the Tomb,"As a fan of historical romance novels, I was really intrigued in the beginning of the book. However, I did find that the story itself moved very slowly in certain sections of the book. I would recommend the book for those avid romance lovers because this book does have the elements needed for love and romance."
5,Finally--Bear's quotes all together,"you don't have to be a sports fan to love this book. The quotes are inspiring. If you're looking for a motivational book, this is it."
5,Very enjoyable and helpful book,"Wow, there is so much Truth shared in this book. I really enjoyed it and found it to be a nice road map, of sorts, of the path to awakening. All paths are welcome! ""Coming Home"" is written in such a beautiful style and it's very easy to grasp formerly abstract thoughts and ideas.The last chapter, ""Designing an Experiment in Contemplation,"" was worth the price of the book. The author explains in very simple terms the four dimensions of contemplation and how they are like the Advaita Vedanta analysis of consciousness...waking, dreaming, dreamless sleep, and Turiya. Turiya = primal radiant Awareness, Oneness.My heart sang reading of Mr. Hixon's experience (pgs. 207-209) with the ""golden radiance .... bright as snow in sunlight....a sense of union....crossing the threshold into nothing but pure transparency and universal awareness..."" If those words speak to you and stir your soul, then you'll find this a fabulous read."
2,strange,I wish the straight tube was longer. It's quite strange to try to vacuum with it. Otherwise product is okay.
5,Great product!,"We put this shade on the ""sunny end"" of our screened porch. It really does the trick! It lets in air but shades the area. I bought it because we also have Coolaroo beds for our dogs. We've had them for years, and they are wonderful."
4,so far so good,"So it was important to me that I have some privacy up here in the hills of tx, where every neighbor can look up/down slope and know your business... I also have allergies and TX is a brewpot for them, so wanted something that, once installed, would hold up pretty well against mold growth...I actually bought my blinds at Lowes. Once we got the measurments right for putting them up, it was a bit difficult to tighten the screws and pull everything to base due to the design of the shade, but we got it done and I'm satisfied now.NOTE:I've had the one shade up for a week - the other two have been lying outside on the porch and it's been raining non-stop here. So far no mold growth, but def check back in a year to see if they're holding up. Another option (which I wish I would've found first, honestly) is to just use [...] and string a curtian bar up, pull back when needed. They are pricey though, so let's see how this hangs for now..."
4,Nice Shades,"Nice, I don't know if it is keeping it 32 percent cooler, but nice and not gaudy. Very neutral colors."
1,Shipping cost must be wrong!,"Shipping cost is stated as $87.52 for a shade which costs $53.93! NO FREAKING WAY! shipping cost is based on weight, $.97/lb. weight stated as 87 lb. Surely this is a mistake, maybe 8.7 lb. @.97 = $8.44 shipping cost would be more like it!"
2,World of Difference....,I purchased 3 of these roll-up shades and installed them on my deck. The difference is tremendous. It took the blaring sun from making our deck brutally unuseable to being very useable during the afternoon and evenings. It also makes a world of difference as to the amount of sun that was beating in through our French doors into our home. We can now leave our doors open and enjoy the breeze coming in without the sun heating up the room or shing in our eyes. We are so glad to have found them..
1,no refund,I returned this unit for exchange because it was the wrong size. Never received the exchange or a refund.
2,Good fabric. Bad design.,"The fabric is quite acceptable. It does exactly as is represented. However, the design needs much improvement. With the least amount of wind, i.e., breeze, the shade will not properly roll up. Also, the straps holding the pole in place (at the bottom of the shade) easily slip off. The shade and the pole are then free to do as they please; in my case, the pole fell to the ground, and the shade flapped in the breeeze. The pole however, is quite capable of smashing into anything within reach. A fine product for a zero wind area."
1,Very junky,"We have a Coolaroo shade on our picture window. It is high quality fabric, fastens down well, and we can see outside but light is still well blocked. When I ordered a couple of Coolaroo shades, thinking I would receive the same quality product, I was appalled when I actually received and opened the packages. I think it would probably work better to go to a local Home Depot or Walmart and purchase some of their shade cloth and tack it over the window. These shades have the same type of fabric as the bulk rolls of shade cloth sold everywhere. It's floppy and does not lie down properly unless it is tightly stretched and fastened down. It will not be possible to view the outside well through these shades. The shades also are cheaply made in every other way. I doubt the plastic parts will hold up well in hot climates. The plastic bar at the bottom of the shade wants to slide right out and the fasteners for that bar are plastic and poorly designed."
2,A Clunker!,"After reading all the highly favorable reviews about Loaded Dice, I was anticipating reading a highly entertaining book. Sorry to say, this book, while being a fast read, didn't have much going for to make it recommendable. In my opinion, it is, at best ""fair."" The plot was very predictable, the dialogue is often unreal and the secondary characters are rather poorly developed. Even the main character -- Tony Valentine -- didn't 'ring true' for me. This was my first book by James Swain and may be my last -- although I have several of the others in this series. I know issuing a critical review on Amazon often results in many negative ratings. I'm willing to risk this if it helps prevent you from making the same mistake I did, which was reading a book that was disappointing."
1,squirt gum review.,"This prank failed to meet my expectations. It is just a cheap cardboard sleeve with a flimsy plastic tube inside that has to be refilled with each use. After a couple of uses, the cardboard wears out, because the cardboard gets wet with each squirt. The first day I got it, after just three uses, it could no longer be used, and I had to throw it away. I would not recommend this product."
4,Everybody's favorite grandfather,"I have read ""La sonrisa etrusca"" with relentless fascination and daunted nostalgia. I completely got excited at the relationship between grandfather and grandchild, their quiet, yet boundless chemistry. There are fewer granddads left like him, honorable, proud, vain, corteous, charming, humorous, altruistic and bragging of the winnings of years past. The book itself is a realistic signature of generational relationships."
5,It's BROOKE !,"Arrived on time and as advertised.Very satisfied with this transaction.If your a Brooke Benton fan, and I are one, he does no wrong."
5,The light is within us all,"Secrets to Eternity is filled with so much light,that it is a blesing that God has given us all the imformation that we need to know in this book, as in all of the books Annalee has written with the pen of heaven.My address 650 north shasta willows CA 95988 Ray castelluccio I have letters from Annalee Skarin."
2,Don't Bother,"Much like Greg's Yardbird's book, this documentation on Mafred Mann is fundematally weak. Greg' prose, dare I call it that, is farily pedantic. This work is purley a catalogue of vinyl releases without any real insight into the creative process behind the music.It is sad that there has not been a real book about this band - becasue this is NOT it!"
5,Hamster Ball,"You may not get the right color, but this ball is perfect for normal hamsters. My hamster loves to run around in it! Does the trick! Shipping was also very fast!"
1,Missing Hamster,"We have had several hamster balls in the past and this one just doesn't measure up. The 2nd time we used it, it came open and Fribble was missing for two days. I now have to tape it shut everytime we use, which is a pain."
1,It was a hinge,"Seller is either a rip off or stupid because It wasn't Stanley and it wasn't solid brassit was an inexpensive steel hinge with a brass color coating marked ""penrose""hinge leaves were too loose to use it in the application I wanted as the doors were interior solid core and too heavy for the hingeI added the hinges to my extra door hinge bucket"
5,Heart over Head,"Firkusny studied with Janacek...almost all reviewers agree that his interpretation is truest to Janacek's intent. Yet in head-to-head listenings, it's the Schiff performance that I prefer.I find the Firkusny performance to be clinical and dry as compared to Schiff, who is more lyrical and poetic. Firkusny may be playing it how Janacek intended, but musicians are artists and are free to interpret a piece any way they like. For this piece, I choose Schiff's interpretation."
3,Intro to Nutrition,"This book was easy to use. I needed this book for a pre-nursing class so I didn't have a choice in wanting to buy this book. Lot of intresting facts, and well put together, my only suggestion would be to not have this book in paperback."
4,Very Relaxing,"This cd is good if you don't own a lot of classical music already. My husband and I do, but this cd is still more on the mellow side of the rest of our collection. What's good is that all of these pieces are light."
1,Elevator Music,"While the collection of music seems good (and similar to many other collections for newborns and babies in utero), the specific recordings are about the most boring renditions I've heard. Classical music isn't necessarily supposed to be relaxing, and I bought this CD on the implication that it is meant to stimulate my unborn child's mind. Can it be doing that while I, the mother, am bored out of my brain? I'd rather find more dynamic recordings, or play the entite opera or symphony, than force myself to listen to this homogenized collection."
4,enjoyable,"I have enjoyed this cd thus far. If you have the money to spend, this is relaxing and enjoyable, however you can get similar music for free on your local classical station. So if you would rather save your money...just tune in on your radio dial. I am glad I bought the cd for the familiarity of the songs, but I also love just plain old classical radio."
1,dissatisfied,"I was very dissatisfied with this product. The pictures are shown in the ad on a dark background. When you get them, they're on a white background, printed in very pale colors, with very bright glitter. It makes them hard to see. They don't look at all like they do in the ad."
2,too much money,Before you buy this product. go to the dollar atore or other websites. because the price and how many you get is a bad one
4,From the Tooth Fairy.,"I use these stickers at some houses to let the little girl know I've been by... It is my Tooth Fairy signature--1 per tooth is left with a little money. I was running low (there are only 2 pages of stickers in this book), and needed more! Found them on Amazon; much less expensive than the supermarket. They arrived in great condition very quickly (prime!) and are still my favorite signature item. The girls love getting a glitter sticker from me almost as much as the coins."
2,12 Stickers?,You hardly get any stickers in the book. My girls will use all of them up in 2 minutes. They are pretty stickers. But at > than 10cents a sticker I don't really think it is worth it.
5,Glitter Fairies Stickers (Dover Little Activity Books),I bought the book for my scrapbooking projects I loved the fairies my only regret is they are almost gone. May have to buy some more books!
1,Deserves Zero Stars!,"NOT what is pictured at all, two half-sheets of fairy bodies without heads, with some stickers cut at the trim. Useless."
3,Crocheting in Chicago,Although the sweaters are easy to make I feel that many of them have a dated look. The yarn suggestions for these sweaters are those sold by CGOA. All yarn requirements are given in yardage with no ounce equivalent so it makes it a little more difficult for you to use other yarns than those sold by CGOA. For one of the sweaters I did want to make I checked the cost of the CGOA yarn and the yarn for this simple tunic would cost $120. I suggest Melissa Leapman's Crochet with Style as the patterns are modern and the yarn is readily available in many craft stores.
4,Used to make life size targets,"This paper was shipped in quick time, is used to make full size ""man"" targets for practice. It staples to the back boards nicely."
5,Very GOOD product!,I needed something for my son to do a timeline. I was looking for something wide and with a good length. I saw this was the least expensive and we LOVE it. I will be able to use it for my kids to color and draw and possibly even paint because it's thick enough. :) VERY happy with product and it's well worth the price.
4,Looks just like the picture.,"It's a metal sign that has been distressed and looks exactly like it does in the picture, only bigger. Looks good hanging on the wall."
4,You can get this volume and three others in the series for very little more.,You can get this volume and three others in the series for very little more. See my review of the whole set:Busoni: Piano Transcriptions [Box Set]Scott Morrison
2,Worked for few months then stopped,Watches looked great and reasonably priced but stopped working after few months. After changing batteries the dial stopped changing colors.
3,"""Just the facts ma'am""","This book is a difficult read. Most writers infuse something of a personality into their writing, even a textbook. I read a lot of books, mostly non-fiction (programming books, networking books) with some fiction thrown in here and there. The authors may know about the subject and clearly they do, but I found myself reading the text in a monitone voice and my eyes glazing over every couple of sentences. Thats because each sentence is just another fact, freeze dried and stuck next to another fact and eventually you get a very wordy paragraph. Add them all together and you get pages and pages of facts.I felt like someone took a vacuum and sucked out all of the life out of the text. Seriously, I was tempted to look at the preface to see if the authors added the instructions to ""just add water before reading"". It really is that dry.If that is your reading style, then this book is for you. I couldn't read more than a couple of pages before having to take a break."
2,"Had to buy it, enough said.","I had to buy this book because of a class...I can't even comprehend how can professors force this book unto students...it is boring to say the least. Paragraphs are eternal with little graphics. If you are not forced to get it, you will do yourself a favor by buying something else."
4,Old School Retro,"MC Skat Kat was the Kat who you heard on Paula Abdul's song ""Opposites Atract"" and later put his own album out. This album has a very early 90's feel (was made in 91) and is a pretty clean album . Good beats, the lyrics are rather childish at times, but very fun. Not to mention, its not too often you see a cartoon cat surronded by his ""bitches"" on a caddy ;)Overall, Im glad I bought it used. Not usually my thing, but definatly cute stuff on this disc."
2,I'm sure it works fine but there are cheaper versions at your hardware store,"Just buy any bacteriastat at your local hardware for about half the price. You don't need to use this brand for your Essick Air humidifier, no matter what they say."
5,"It's perfectly fine, if the price is right buy it","I find that with products like these, the real issue in determining whether to buy them is whether they are what they claim to be. This stuff is the real thing, it's for killing bacteria in your humidifier water. Worked fine. Good price. Obviously compare the price at the local big box store, but otherwise, it's good stuff."
2,Use caution!,"I bought Essick Air #1970 Quart Bacteria Treatment for the new humidifier I bought for the office. When it arrived, it was inside a bag, and when I took out the bottle, it was wet - it had obviously leaked sometime during the shipment. I was taking it to the sink to wipe it off, when I noticed the warning label. If the product comes in contact with your skin, you must rinse that skin (my hand in this case) for 15 to 20 minutes! And you're also supposed to call poison control or something like that (which I didn't). Apparently the stuff can cause severe burns. That was enough to make me throw it in the trash."
5,Thumbs up,Ordered it for my mother. She likes it so well I ordered 2 to have one on hand.Will order same product in the future
5,Great product,Have been using this for 2 years now and it works great. Keeps our wick fresher longer. Can get t least 2 seasons out of a wick.
3,treatment,I've never noticed the difference in any of these but this one is recommended for my unit. I've already ordered more.
5,Christian teen loves this album!!,"I first saw this group at a Teen Summit taping concerning urban Christian music. They were tight! They are definitely a group you wanna see live. You can tell they are singing from a relationship with God and not just trying to entertain. Track #3 is a good Christian party song. I also liked the song that talks about being holy! It's about time people realized that we are to live a different lifestyle then the people who don't know God!! They have some really beautiful worship songs at the end especially Victory is in the PRaise! Anyway!! :o) Much success Spiritual Pieces!! You are loved in Richmond, Virginia!! MAy God keep you and protect you!!"
1,porque tantos cortes?,Le cortaron tantas partes importantisimas que la novela quedo hecha un asco .... la novela Corazon Salvaje cuando la miras en su enteridad es fabulosa... el dvd que compre lo tire a la basura ....nada que ver me dio tanta bronca!! Los ejecutivos de televisa estaban borrachos cuando mandaron a que cortaran tantas partes .....QUE HORROR>>>IDIOTAS>
1,Not worth it!!!,"If you are looking for a beautiful and passionate story you'd do better by looking for the original version of Corazon Salvaje, with Edith Gonzalez and Eduardo Palomo. Notwithstanding the issues with the edition of these dvds, the story is just not worth it.Corazon Salvaje"
3,MY SUGGESTION FOR A BETTER CONDENSED VERSION,"FIRST...I RECEIVED 3 DVDS, INSTEAD OF 4. BUT THE {SHORT VERSION} OF THIS NOVELA WAS COMPLETE THRU THE 3RD DVD. I RECOMMEND THIS SHORT VERSION ONLY FOR FANS WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE $200.00 COMPLETE BOX SET & WHO CAN BE SATISFIED WITH ONLY HALF THE STORY. MY SUGGESTION TO THE EDITORS IS THIS...EVEN A FOURTH DVD WOULD HAVE GIVEN US SO MUCH MORE THAN HALF THE STORY. WHY DID YOU STOP AT JUST THREE??? YOU WOULD MAKE A BETTER SALE OF THESE NOVELAS IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US A LIITLE MORE STORY FOR A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PRICE. WE WOULD HAPPILY PAY MORE FOR THAT."
5,It is good,I recommend watching it as it is really good. It is sad that many Russian/Soviet movies based on Western literature never really made it to the West. This one is shot on the Black sea and much more faithfull to the original Christies story (including title) than any of the famed Western movies including the 1945 one. Some actors are stars and legends in Russia.Boris
2,Only for pure devoted film buffs,"Have just finished watching this movie so this review is based on initial impressions and not with the benefit of some time thinking about the film. For people contemplating purchasing this version of the classic Agatha Christie tale I would say you would have to be particularly devoted, especially considering the price. Despite the film being made in 1987 it is poor in technical quality but gets points for artistic merit. The English translation is unnecessarily clumsy and the quality of the disc replication is also poor. The disc I watched seized in the middle and then sent me forward in time some 20 minutes. So one murder was never seen. I've tried in two different blu-ray players (zone A + B) and one multi-zone DVD player and all don't work.So summing up, if you want a classic, have the $ and can put up with some of what I've described I would go ahead and purchase this film. Otherwise, just pass."
4,very Russian,"This program is very Russian. They have taken the Christie plot and produced it in a totally Russian style. The only English things about the production is that some of the men wear vests with their suits or smoke pipes. Also the ""English"" subtitles are literal translations from Russian in Russian grammar. These are amusing. The end of the story is very morbid in the Russian style.The only improvement I could think of is that they should have woven excerpts from ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" into the sound track."
1,"Horrible Service, order at your own risk","Do not order the movie if you don't have capabilities to play it in the PAL format. The service was good up until I tried to play the DVD on my player. The sender had asked me to sent the DVD back and after several emails with no reply on status of my order i had to request help from Amazon rep. Only after I spoke to the Amazon representative I received a reply from the sender that I am going to be reimbursed not only for the initial order but for sending the DVD back. Note, the description on Amazon doesn't mention anything about the DVD capable of playing only on PAL format. Bottom line, do not order the movie if you don't have the DVD player that capable of playing DVDs in PAL format. Plus, it will take you a while to get your money back. Good luck!"
2,The Peddling of Common sense,The Rev. Gitmo Dollars is the most recent in a long line of charlatans (like T.D. Fakes) who are having a field day getting rich by exploiting the crisis Black women are facing these days. This book is basic common sense craftily designed to get the bucks from the confused. Go to a good friend's shoulder and you can save your money on Rev. Dollar's cadillacs.
5,Nice product,Great product to have on the go and was delivered on time. Would recommend to anybody who always wants to have their favorite perfume handy
3,Illustrated RZ,"It's a nice book for the Zelazny enthusiast. It contains several short stories and lots of pictures. The best things about this book are (1) the Shadow Jack story which isn't part of the ""Jack of Shadows"" novel, and (2) the Amber artwork.Be careful, however, because there are two versions of the book: paperback sized and magazine sized. The magazine sized book is clearly the better of the two because it is pretty much all in color and easier to read. The paperback version isn't as nice because they cut out parts of the stories to make them fit in the smaller format, plus much of the book is black and white."
2,Only for completists,A mixed bag. There are a few comic book adaptation of his stories (Halfjack) while others are re-printed with color illustrations. These are quite garish and don't hold up that well on the glossy paper.Maybe for the completist but offers nothing new to those already familiar with Zelazny's work.
4,a bit of everything,"great read before bed 40k book. A short story a night sending one off to blissful dreams of Chain-swording the entrails out of a gene stealer or blasting a war boss point blank with a Leman Russ. A very insightful look into the many ways through many branches of service the God-Emperor is protecting Humankind. ""For the Emperor!!"""
4,Decent Collection of Short Sci-Fi,The stories are fairly even... only a few stand out and none are particularly bad. I enjoyed reading it as a 40k player... more fluff!!
3,"Good, but flawed.","Having an intrest in Egypt, I picked this book up and finished it in three days. At first I liked the book, but after a while it became the same thing over and over. I liked how the author showed the common aspects of Egyptian life, but the dialog and style was so simple it got on my nerves. Also, how could the son of Seti be subject to so much abuse by commoners? I never could figgure out this aspect. Another flaw of the book was they way in which characters kept entering and then leaving only to pop up later. Ramses sister is a good example of this. Over all, I liked this book but won't read the next four in the series."
3,An Easy Read,"I wouldn't depend too much on the historical accuracy of ""Ramses: Son Of Light,"" but the pacing is good and it's cleanly written. Christian Jacq gets right to the point without wasted words. It's not deep, and it's not meant to be deep. Got a long flight or road trip ahead of you? This is the book for you."
4,"Fun to read, but with no depth",This was a fun and addictive book. I would definitely recommend it on a rainy Sunday! Take it for what it is ... just fun fiction.
2,I was disappointed by the entire series,"the series promises much more than it can deliver. there is very little plot development and character development. Ramses is the pharoah-to-be, a morally upright if brash person, and all the people who are against him are evil, the ones for him are the good guys, who have their personal flaws.i agree with the author of the review ""Just Missed the Mark"", that somehow, without good reasons given, Ramses always seems to come out on top no matter what happens and despite of all the plotting of his enemies. he's THE only one invincible, morally-upright, just, caring guy with the gods-given authority to lead. no one else gets to win, just Ramses.this series disappointed me. an encyclopedia could have been more exciting."
3,Sweet & Sour,"This book has good points and bad points, enough good points to keep reading, but not by much.Many parts are WAY too predictable, or ridiculously unlikely. I wish I had a dollar for every time Ramses met up with a friend by an extreme stretch of coincidence. I feel often like the author throws in whatever in convenient to move the story with the least resistance.Also, I have studies Ramses II extensively, and will be the first to admit that he was an impressive man, however, some of the things the author has Ramses do are just plain unfeasible.SO, I'm reading along & it seems *just* about when I get captivated, the author throws in another improbable, if not impossible coincidence, which has tempted me to just put the book down.However, I don't put it down. Once again, I guess it's good points override the bad, but not by much.Honey Hellfire"
2,nice try but dissapointing,"I was hoping for some insight into one of the most fascinating figures in ancient Egypt but instead got a boring and very obviously fictitious, one-dimentional character who I'm sure bears little resemblence to the real Ramses. The supporting characters are even worse.The situations Ramses finds himself in and survives are almost laughable. This is more like the young readers, prime-time TV version of Ramses early life. Still, the book was easy to read and I could finish it in one day. I'll give book 2 a chance before I give up on the series. Maybe the story gets better."
3,dont' expect to learn from this book,"Dont' expect to learn much about the life of Ramesses II from this book. Just as the rest of the series,while it is a good book for a lazy day at the beach, it is full of historical speculations and mostly historicaly inacurate."
2,Very dissapointing,"I was looking forward to learning something about Ancient Egypt, whilst enjoying a good story. Unfortunately the characters in this book are cartoon like. Ramses is brave, strong, handsome, intelligent, moral, honest etc.. he doesn't have a single flaw. Whilst his brother is greedy, devious, unattractive, dishonest, etc.. he doesn't have a single redeeming feature. This is pretty much the way all the characters are painted. The story is similarly simple and unrealistic. I do not believe this is just poor translation, it's too fundamental, it must be poor writing.The overall effect is that of a comic book version of the Pharoahs. If that's what you are looking for, or if you plan to read this to your kids, then it might be worth the money. Otherwise I would leave this on the shelf."
5,An enjoyable read - make sure you get the whole series!,"This is the first in a five part series that really manages to blend history and full-blown fiction. Jacq's Egypt comes alive and jumps off the page, stealing you away to a world where magic might just be real and all those dry history stores come to life. I was really surprised at who ""the good guys"" and ""the bad guys"" turned out to be, and found myself really feeling for the characters in the pages. I highly recommend reading the series in order - you might just catch yourself rereading it, like I did ... wow, I just realized how cheezy that all sounds, but they really are great books."
4,Great historical fiction!,"I have written a review about this book when I first read it and I must say it really is a wonderful fiction piece. I read this novel during the freshmen year of highschool, and now as a Graduate Student who has a more in-depth understanding on literary works, this books still continues to hold up and I find it to be a wonderful text. The casual reader will not be turned off by the length of it, as it is not quite long nor does it convey itself as a rather difficult read. Anyone who has a passion for Egyptian history will appreciate this book."
4,Ramses Determination,"Ramses: The Son Of Light is a very interesting book. In the beginning, Ramses is portrayed as a very inmature young boy. Although he is somewhat inmature, he already has some dreams in life. Ramses father played an important role in his life. Each encounter he had with his father seemed to make him stronger and more determined to become pharoah. After Ramses realized that he wanted to follow in his father footsteps, he seemed to force himself to grow up. There were many people who tried to stand in his way but he never lost touch with his dream to become pharoah. Ramses brother, Shanaar tried to make him feel as if he was smart and strong enough to do everything execpt become pharoah. After being faced with so many negative things from his brother and some of his friends, Ramses proved himself to be a very and determined man. Ramses showed everyone that he was capable of being pharoah. The is a very wonderful book, you must read it."
2,So much potential wasted,With the cover promising the work of an expert Egyptologist I had hoped that the writing in this book would bring alive the feel of Ancient Egyptian times. In this it fails there is very little description to help the reader paint mental pictures in the way Colleen McCullogh did so successfully in her histories of Rome. Instead we get a soap opera that over the following novels descends into a tale of unrealistic magic and mysticsm. Don't buy this book save your money.
1,Highly romantic yet far from the truth!!!,"I must say that, the book as a novel, contains a romantic tale eleborated by fictions yet not facts... As I am being an Archaeologist, it challenges my education and imagination, at one point it is unbeliavable to say that Ramesses himself had met the heroes of his age such as Menelaos, Helen... I suppose Jacq must start to be more objective and nonfiction, otherwise he will start writing tales for children. On the other hand, his passion for Egypt has turned this novel into a barbaric source with the way he eleborates the ancient Greece and other near eastern civilizations such as the Hittites."
2,"Interesting subject, one dimensional writing","I was hoping for much more from this book. Well-written historical fiction can be a delightful read, but this isn't it. I don't think you can blame it on the translation; it's really not a close call. The characters are flat and one dimensional, the interplay between them is alternately stiff and sophomoric, and the story is riddled with cliches. In places, it almost reads like a children's book. Jacq apparently is an egyptologist, but this book doesn't inspire confidence in the accuracy of its historical foundation. I don't give it the lowest possible rating because it is based on an interesting subject and on those occasions when the reader wishes to switch off his/her critical faculties (e.g., on a plane or at the beach) it may be a pleasant diversion."
3,"Okay for a light read, but...",... I wondered about some of the historical accuracy. (Has something been lost in the translation here?) Good entertainment value though.
2,What a rip!,"This is Volume 1 in a 5 volume series (at $14.95 each). At $14.95 for all 5 volumes, it might be worth it. This is either a very bad translation, or VERY badly written."
2,Interesting but too light.............,"I have always been interested in Egypt and was thus looking forward to this book. Jacq does an adequate job of recreating the feeling of Egypt, but I became bored quite quickly. The storyline is very light, with few thought-provoking passages. The character development is weak, and the dialogue predictable and lacking in depth. It very much reminded me of the biographies I read in Junior High school. Jacq certainly can't compete with the the likes of Michener or Rutherford (Sarum) in bringing the reader back to times past. I won't be reading any more of this series."
2,"Easy reading, but for history buffs has no value!","If you like Wilbur Smith etc. go ahead. But otherwise don't waste your time. I have read the 4 books so far, just out of curiosity to see how much the history was twisted. Ramses turned out to be a super hero and a lot of historical facts were changed in his favor. I wish it would have been a much more ""factual fiction"". I enjoyed it as a fiction, but got mad because of contradictions."
2,Could have been better,"I don't know why this book was an International Best Seller. Perhaps the French know something we don't. I found this book extremelly boring. The charachters were too simplistic and the action was too eratic. I had expected a lot more from an Egyptologist and someone who had been writing books since he was a teen. The setting was weak--I never felt like I was ""in"" Egypt. I won't read the sequel. The only thing positive I have to say about this book is that it was simple to read. Unfortunatly, it was so easy, it was like reading a children's book. I don't recommend it. Sorry Jacq!"
1,What a stinker!,"For those of you thinking you're going to get an insightful look into Ancient Egypt through a well-written work of historical fiction, stay away. This is an extremely amateurish book. For one example, the author insists on telling us about the characters, using long strings of adjectives, instead of letting them speak for themselves. It's ridden with cliches, impossible to get involved in, and composed in the style of a very cheap romance. The publishers should be ashamed of themsleves."
1,Yawn! What a disappointment.,"I was truly disappointed in this book. I COMPLETELY agree with the reviewer who called it ""Ramses for Dummies"". Perhaps it is the translation, but there is no character development, no meaningful dialog, and since any person with any knowledge of history already knows how its going to turn out, the plot really doesn't matter. Furthermore, the language and motivation of the characters resembles too closely those of modern times. I don't know how an author can make such an inherently interesting subject so DULL! I only finished it because I was on a plane and trapped without anything else to read.For those of you who like novels set in ancient Eygpt, I recommend Lynda Robinson's Lord Meren mystery series. These books are infinately more enjoyable, and so well written that I enjoy re-reading them, even though I already know ""whodunnit"". P.S. -- For another good historical series, I highly recommend Lindsey Davis' Didius Falco novels, which are set in ancient Rome."
4,Good for those who are curious about Egypt and the Pharaohs,"An entertaining tale on ancient Egypt by the time of Pharaoh Ramses II (circa 1200 B.C.). Can't tell about the accuracy, but it is certainly very well written. Difficult to stop reading, once you get started. I'm looking forward to read the next volumes of this wonderful saga."
5,Fascinating,This book creates a mystique and feel for ancient Egypt. It makes even a teenager as myself feel fascinated and curious about the ancient Egyptian lifestyle. That is why I gave it 5 stars.
5,Very Readable,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. In fact, I read it in 2 nights. The story flows. The characters are ""knowable"" and its easy to develop a ""bond"" with them. The times and customs are also outlined rather well which sets the stage for this reading. The author blends historical facts in with the characters superbly. For those who wish to learn about history but cannot seem to get through the cumbersome, fact filled text of most of the historical books, this book is a great way to learn about ancient Egypt and her Pharoah Ramses II."
4,"Ramses, from boy to man","Ramses is a very interesting and exciting book. This book showed how an young boy can be transformed into a man. Jacq did a wonderful job with this book. There were always something going own that kept you wondering just what was going to happen next. In this book, Ramses proved himself to be very strong-willed. Ramses began by being a boy but quickly advances to a young man.By the middle of the book,Ramses was very mature and knew what he wanted to do with his life. Ramses used his physical and mental abilities while he was trying stand out in his father eyes.Ramses quest was for him to get his father to see that he had all the qualities to be a Pharoah. I think that his father always knew that Ramses was strong and that he would always do well. Ramses faced many problems with people doubting him but he stayed focused on what he wanted to do.This is a wonderful book, you must read it."
5,It is amazing!!!,"I have not read other egyptian fiction beside christian's yet but...I have to share that I was more than just enjoying this book,...It takes me too really feel as I was brought back to ancient egyptian time and she the story,... the languange is not difficult to digest so that it will be enjoyable for first timmer.... It will encourange younger people to read and learn some history,....I don't know about the accuracy on the historical facts but it will give interest for sure.... As a novel it is very enjoyable to read and I can't wait to read the volume2... For whatever purpose whether novel, history,....I recommend this book,... On the story it gives an introduction lives of Ramses,..."
1,Scraping the Bottom of the Pyramid,I totally agree with the reviewer who identifies himself as A Reader From Troy. Cartoon characters exactly. Is it the fault of the author alone or the translator as well? Whoever has compared this author to Dorothy Dunnett should really have his head examined. Second graders would like this one.
2,Reads like a romance novel,"After reading Pauline Gedge's books (her books on Egypt are a must read), I was looking forward to more historical fiction on Egypt. However, I was sorely disappointed by this book. At first I thought it might be the translation - at one point Ramses says ""Right on."" One would think he was a modern American teenager rather than 2nd in line to the throne! Reading on though, I realised that it couldn't just be the translation -Ramses ends up in a fight with some grooms in the stables - you would think they should recognize him from his dress and manner! I couldn't finish the book. Unless you like romance novel style books or you are younger, I would go with Pauline Gedge's books - start with ""Child of the Morning"" or Lady of the Reeds."""
2,An after school special in ancient Egypt.,"While having a rather animated tone that could interest some that would otherwise run away screaming at the thought of a ""historical"" novel, the book carries it too far. Besides the afore-mentioned innacuracies (the contemporary presence of Helen of Troy, etc.)the novel's biggest problem for me was how the characters talked. It was like a after-school special set in Egypt, with Rameses coming off at times like a reject out of Dawson's Creek. Many of the characters were overly played as stereotypes -Seti as the father who never understands, the cranky older brother, manipulative ex, and so forth - to begin with, and sounding like petulant teenagers did not help the situation."
1,Scholastic reading club nominee...,"...or at least that is how this, uh, piece of historical fiction should have been marketed. The plot is a juvenile mystery in which the greatest of Egypt's pharoahs (albeit in a younger guise) and his friend, Moses (yes, THAT Moses), are the sleuths. The prose is moaningly bad even for the 'tweens crowd for which this novel should have been aimed, and the characters are riduculously flat and clichéd. It also offers little to no detail of society or daily life in those times thus failing to believably ""set the stage"" and transport the reader. If you're really looking for some decent historical fiction, try Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series. Not the same time period or topic, but you adults in crowd will not feel intellectually insulted with each passing paragraph. I rate this a one star only because I cannot leave half a star. Why would it earn even half a star? Spelling."
2,The first two were captivating but it's downhill from there!,"I bought this book because I'm interested in Egyptology but rather than reading just hard facts I thought I'd make my read a little more colourful. So I started off with lots of enthusiasm as I read the first 2 volumes. Half-way through the third volume and I was beginning to find the story a little over-the-top every time Ramses and Nefertari gazed at each other and felt their love. They kept rediscovering their love and their feeling kept growing the more intense.....it's was just too ""corny"" for me to handle. I know the book has a lot of history in it but I'd rather it wasn't told in a too fairy-tale manner. The good thing is that the story moves at a great pace....especially towards the end in the fourth and fifth volume."
1,Avoid wasting your money.,"If this book took the French Reading public by storm then we must certainly wonder what happened to the famous French intellect. It is too bad that Jacq didn't bother to learn something about Egyptian history -- a university in Memphis?! The son of Seti I being set upon by stable hands?! Ramses needing a 'job'?! Is Jacq simply a fool or is he demented? -- ad nauseum, and that was only the first handful of chapters. The book is a waste of time and money."
1,YIKES!,"It's an extremely easy and fast read but terribly misleading. Historically inaccurate. If you read this go into it knowing it's PURE fiction. Honestly, outside of it's misleading, the writing was so remedial I found it uninteresting. More like a soap opera than an opportunity to learn ANYTHING of the time. The only thing historical about this book would be the names Ramses and Moses...which the author does a fine job of bastardizing rather that bringing to life in a manner that is believable."
3,got bored with it,Ramses was too perfect for my taste. He excelled at everything he tried. I got about halfway and decided I just didn't care.
1,Do The French Actually Think This Sort of Writing Is GOOD!?!,"I guess there is no accounting for taste. I am seeing reviews saying this book is suitable for a 12-15 year old audience. Yes, perhaps ones that are not very well read.If you don't have a good grasp of what good fiction is or what history really is about, these books are fine. However, if you dont want to insult your intelligence, my advice is don't bother with this series."
3,would be good for kids....,"This book was borderline-interesting, but luckily with the large font and huge illustrations that winnow the actual story length down by 50% you won't be reading it long. I don't understand the PRICE, though, $14.95? I'm glad I borrowed it. I will say, though, that this book would be great for junior high/ highschool age kids. It does a good job of somehow relating the ancient Egyptian daily life to our modern lives. Jacq talks about bad complexions, distaste for overweight people, ""cosmetics"", teenagers graduating, sneaking out and drinking to discuss what they'll do when they grow up....I'd say it would create interest in ancient cultures and Egyptology in young minds and might be best appreciated in that age group. For adults, however, it proves to be a somewhat mindless, fast read.Oh, and I'd read the sequel, you know how it ends in a very tricky position for our hero, but I already know how the story comes out!"
3,Ramses - too good to be true?,"I agree wholeheartedly with some of the other reviewers; the standard of writing is extremely basic and in many respects the book is not well written. Never-the-less, if one wants a nice easy read with little use of the grey-matter required, this could be your book! Ramses as a character is too good to be true... ok, he became arguably the greatest ever pharaoh, but geez what a pain! Still, worth a read as long as you don't have to buy it!"
1,elementary school level,I was also disappointed in this book. It is written at a grade school level! Nowhere in the same league as other pieces of historical fiction.
4,Quite nice,"i think that this is quite a good book revealing an insight of the power of Ramses. Although this is a purely fictional novel, some of it may be based on history. The novel is simple and can be appreciated by most."
2,A mixture of historical fact and contemporary language,"I was excited to find a novel based in Ancient Egypt written by someone who has an advanced degree in Egyptology. I was disappointed by some of the contemporary language used in the book. For example, when Shanaar walks into Ahsha's office and makes a comment about Ahsha having been promoted into a coveted ""corner office"". This phrase I equate with modern upward mobility, not Dynastic Egypt. This, I realize, may have to do with the fact that I was reading a novel traslated into English not written in English and it often happens that things get lost in the translation."
1,beware of historical fiction,"If you are going to read this tripe be sure you first have a background in history so as not to be taken in by this pure fiction.If you are willing to believe in time transporting so Hellen can stop by on her was home form Troy and Homer can lounge around Alexandria while he ""writes"" his stories.If you can swollow all that, you can have a ball with the whole series."
1,MUCH ADDO ABOUT NOTHING !,"Much has been said about this book. But, like a great number of French writers costumely do, this book is written in a boring narrative."
3,"Engrossed reading, retrospectively speaking.","i tend to agree with most of the comments from the other readers, however, the readers have to read jacq's other writings on Ramses to appreciate the era and ambience of the saga, and for info, the saga encompasses 4 books and 1 book on jacq's intepretation of life and to a certain extend, literature of ancient egyptians. and not 5 as written by stillsammy."
5,intriguing,"christian jacq has definitely brought one of histories most intiguing personalities to life. His colourful portrayal of ancient Egypt gives one a rare insight into how the rich and famous of that time lived and died. one can easily imagine oneself standing there and witnessing the deviousness of Shaanar, the majesty of Seti and Tuya and the beauty of Nerfetari. this book also truly potrays a vivid picture of Ramses' iron rule over Egypt."
4,"Captivating, it turely gets you hooked on the series!",As a lover of both Ancient Egypt and historical fiction I realy liked this book. Although it embelishes the facts a bit it for the most part is thought to be true. Once I read this book I went on to read all but vol.5 wich I am now buying. If you like fantasy and/or historical ficton this is a series you should try!
2,Dissapointing,"Very dissapointing. I expected another bright book like Uarda but instead found a writing style similar to that of a 14 year old: poor in vocabulary, depth and wisdom and over-compensating with insignificant episodes one after the other. Useless to say, I won't purchase any of the next 5 books in the series."
3,Not Much substance,"I know the description of this book mention it's length and the book did not cost much, but still I got nothing from the book. I do wish I had had someone like this author to help me at the shelter I was at when I left my verbally abusive husband. I was hoping to get a spiritual side to my dilemma and some people who might like a simpler book may get something from this. If it's free it might be worth the effort. I did give it a three since some may get something to go on here, I am just into more meat."
3,Keeping the faith,"An interesting read for those looking for guidance. This book however advises the reader poorly. Stating that the marriage covenant has already been broken by the abuser, and basically offering a 'way out' for the abused and calling it Christian advice."
2,"LOOKS GOOD, BUT VERY UNSTABLE","I bought this Ab crunch and to my greatest dissapointment, I could not fix it without additional tools unlike other exercise equipment I bought at the same time. After many trials, I got it fixed just to discover it is not stable due to one of the feet not touching the ground. For a product of this price, the manufacturers should have paid more attention to detail. Please use with care to avoid accidents."
2,Bad design. I wouldn't buy it again,"Next time I'll build my own turnbuckle and cable. Stanley's design is terrible. I gave it a 2 rating ONLY because I liked the corner 45 degree brackets. If you buy this product, first thing to do is throw away the cable clamps and buy REAL clamps at the hardware store. Their clamps are horrible. It's hard for to believe Stanley would put out such a garbage product. C'mon Stanley, you can do better than this."
2,Not enough for examination,"It is a good book for beginners. However, the part of NAT is not easy to read. The steps are not shown in details. If the author can show a real example from the installation, create a firwall object to antispoofing like Microsoft Press. I think it will become a bible of checkpoint firewall.Checkpoint added a lot of new questions into the CCSA NG examinations. The questions are very good. It can fully test your practical knowledge. I got only 64. The passing marks was 69. So this book cannot provide a full pictures for the new requirments."
2,Not much romance,"I was kind of disappointed with this book. The ghost of Lady Allyson tricks Derek in going back in time to help her get out of a disastrous marriage. But, when he gets there she doesn't remember him and spends the whole time being mean and humiliating him.When he finally has had enough and washes his hands of her, she decides to be nice to him. It isn't until the last few pages of the book they come together and that's rushed by the author.The premise of the story was a good one, but was not executed very well."
3,hitch extension,"Well I wanted it to extend out my 2"" ball so the trailer tongue would not hit the tires when turning well the picture showed 3 holes one to attach it to the ATV hitch mount but the ball would only fit in the middle hole not the one on the end.I am not sure what that hole is for.So it works better than not having one at all but I was dissapointed because the ball would not fit the outer hole.They should have pointed this fact out.It is heavy duty"
5,Best Political Book I've Read - Exposes Carter Completely,"This tightly edited classic wisely uses a straightforward, chronological approach in bringing the 1980 Presidential election to vivid life. It is not overly long as these authors' book on Bush vs Dukakis '88 election was. Well worth the hassleof buying used.Carter's lack of political instincts and his often contradictory personality (usually conciliatory yet capacle of pettiness and vindictiveness) are well illustrated here. The '80 primary elections are wonderfully covered, even minor candidiates such as Howard Baker and Robert Dole are covered. Teddy Kennedy's only presidential campaign is thoroughly dissected. The authors evenhandedly cover the Reagan and Carter and (remember) John Anderson campaigns. Buy it!"
3,Fair account of the 1980 elections,"Germond and Witcover, who wrote a series of election analyses, do a so-so job on this one. They cover all the major events, up through Reagan's inauguration speech, without very strong commentary - just the facts. They do a good job of showing the manipulation by both sides as well as looking at how their media colleagues blew a few events out of proportion, knocking various contenders from the race. Fairly dry read but it has its interesting points. Somewhat recommended."
5,"full of useful info from those who have ""been there""","""Speaking Successfully"" is a great book. It's well organized and full of useful info and tips from those who have ""been there, done that."""
5,One of my most treasured sources of resource information,"""Speaking Successfully"" has become one of my most treasured sources of resource information. The wealth of ideas makes it invaluable for my articles and presentations. It should be a MUST for every speaker. Thank you for taking the initiative in putting this work together."
2,Cheaply made harmonica,"I was very disappointed with this harmonica - so I sent it back to Amazon as it is cheaply made and sounds like it. The comb has protrusions which cut your lips when playing. You can't disassemble it for cleaning or repair.If you want a decent harmonica in this range, buy the Hohner Special 20 Marine Band, or better still, the Lee Oskar equivalents which have superior tone and quality and can be taken apart easily for cleaning and adjustments."
4,Good workout-moderately strenuous for intermediate/advanced,"I ordered this because one reviewer claimed it was by far Amy Dixon's hardest workout. This may have been true at the time ""Super Fit Bod!"" was published (2009), but as of now, I'd say it's nowhere near the level of difficulty of ""Breathless Body"" at level 3. Still, it's pretty good--moderately strenuous for an intermediate/advanced exerciser. I don't use heavy hand weights since I don't want to bulk up my arms, but using them might make it more challenging if you don't mind that. Next time I will try strapping on a 20 lb waist weight for the no-impact sections to see if I can sustain a higher heart rate throughout. Be aware that you need a step--preferably a long, rectangular one, for this workout. Final judgement: Not super-intense as I'd hoped, but I'm glad to have this in my collection!"
3,High Impact,Amy Dixon is one of the best DVD instructors--unfortunately I didn't know this routine had so much jumping in it--the modifications always seem too low key for me but I can't do high impact--otherwise its a great workout.
5,AMY DIXON / SUPER FIT BOD!,Amy Dixon is an inspiration for what she does.She is an excellent teacher and amazing person.She can bring your fitness to a whole new level.
2,Least Favorite Amy DVD,"I love Amy Dixon's DVD's and her training style. However, this DVD fell flat for me. First of all, I didn't know I'd need a step bench (I just do the moves without it though), and I didn't feel the exercises were very inspired or fun. I didn't feel as sore afterward as I do with her other DVD's and for some reason I felt maybe the production of this one was rushed or not planned out as well as her others. I still use it, peppering it in with her other DVD's- mostly when I'm tired and don't want as strenuous of a workout- but it's not my favorite or one I'd reach for otherwise."
4,Good but not as advanced as I hoped,I really enjoy Amy for several reasons including real body types in her videos and clearly communicated moves. However after having coquered Breathless Body by Amy Dixon I was anticipating tne same level of challenge which was not the case. I will still keep it and use it does not putthe fear in me like her other video.lol!
5,Fat Incinerator,This dvd will make you work but don't give up because it will produce positive results! You will need a step bench and weights to get the most out of the work out.
2,"Sturdy, but poor design","I liked the look of this caddy and how it would hold the CPU firmly min place (I thought). Turns out that it IS sturdy, but because of a design flaw, it simply can't receive more than a couple stars from me. The rollers are held in place with wing nuts. Those wing nuts are right next to the place where the CPU sits and when the unit is tight in place they rub against the CPU and cause scraping problems. It also causes the CPU not to sit properly in the caddy. One other thing, the caddy is not long enough to allow enough of the CPU to sit in place. Oh well. I'm not returning it since I still think it basically works, but I can't recommend it."
4,Poorly made but does the job,"I dont know if the manufactures have ever put one of these together and had to try to manipulate your hands to tighten the wing nuts but it is next to impossible. I finally got the thing put together (which is pretty easy), set the computer inside of it and the next instruction is to tighten the wing nuts around the computer. Well that really isn't possible so I did the best I could and it works just fine. I just wish there was some other way that they could build the holder that isn't so awkward. All in all I gave it a 4 because it works, but wouldn't really recommend it, I would look for something that will actually allow you to tighten the wing nuts."
3,Inexpensive Caddy,"Pros:*Inexpensive*Easy to put togetherCons:*When being rolled, the CPU case still tends to slip inside the caddy, even with the rubber inserts provided.*The photo gives an impression that the caddy is silver/chrome, or shiny, at least -- when, in fact, it has a dull, greenish color (but it's under my desk; so, who cares?)."
2,Poor Quality in Wing Nuts,"I bought three of these nifty looking items and they should have worked well except that some of the wing nuts in each package would not screw on past the second rotation. Made it impossible to attached the wheels securely. I had to go to the hardware store only to discover that the threading in the items was not permitting the wind nuts to screw on fully. I bough several washers and hex nuts and managed to get the job done. Pity. The product is otherwise well make and looks fine and hold the computers well. Not suitable for newer, narrow slim profile desk tops as the minimum width is too wide to hold them surely."
1,BEWARE: Computer slides right out the back of this holder.,Reasons this doesn't work:1. The holder is too small in length. You have to center the CPU in it and it doesn't stay centered because when you try to move the unit the CPU slides. If you have a small CPU it may be okay..but I bet it will still slide. There is nothing 'holding' the CPU in. Don't be fooled by thinking it will 'clamp' onto the CPU. It doesn't and if it is done too tight...when it slides it will scratch the CPU.2. The CPU when moved slides out the back. Not a good thing to have your system slide out and tilt..this may cause damage.3. Of the 8 wingnuts that came with it only 2 actually fit completely on. The others were manufactured with defects. I guess no one tests that part of the product before shipping. I needed to purchase my own.4. I am now looking for another one and feel I wasted [...] on this item.
4,Excellent - Except for the Wing Nuts,"I read the reviews before I ordered this computer tower caddy, so I was expecting at least a couple of wing nuts that didn't fit. There were three, that no matter where I tried them on the various posts, they just didn't fit. I solved the problem by spending $1.50 at my local hardware. I took a wheel with me for measuring and got the right size. Then the caddy went together beautifully.It's very sturdy and easy to wheel. The computer doesn't slide around in it. I'd have given it full marks if it wasn't for the company's inability to include quality wing nuts."
2,Not for heavy rigs,"I have a decently hefty CPU rig and I purchased this stand to get it off the floor. The stand's concept looks pretty legitimate, but in practice with my CPU it was flimsy and was difficult to fully squeeze to fit the width of the case. I was only able to get the stand to perfectly hold my CPU with the help of another person, however, taking it back out again requires two people as well."
4,just what I needed,"Needed a small CPU cart on casters, this fits the bill perfectly. The stainless look is nice and fits well with my contemporary/clean/modern decor."
4,Does the job...,"This CPU caddy does what it is supposed to do. It is easy to assemble, looks good, and works well. I would not recommend paying more than $20 for it."
4,Does the job,"Nothing too exciting about this product, but it performs well and was easy to assemble. I like the idea of having a caddy on wheels so I can pull the desktop out away from the wall or easily move it to clean underneath. It's a good product."
1,This is a piece of garbage Don't buy,The morons who designed this product decided to paint over the threads on the bolts that hold the assembly together. This makes screwing on the wingnuts by hand impossible. So I had to use a monkey wrench. And since the bolts were held loosely into place by the very same paint....the force from twisting on the wingnuts caused the bolts to freak free from the assembly. So now I have the assembly put together but I cannot tighten it to encase the computer. My hands hurt from squeezing the wrench so hard to put on the wingnuts.I think I got a returned product myself because I noticed that someone else used a wrench on my wingnuts - they were all dinged up.DO NOT BUY. THIS IS A TERRIBLE PRODUCT. I FEEL CHEATED. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. AND THE 20 MINUTES OF MY LIFE I SPENT TRYING TO ASSEMBLE THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE. IT BELONGS IN A LANDFILL. I HATE IT THAT MUCH.
4,Does the job,No PC should be on the floor- This is the best looking caddy and reasonably priced- easy to put together in 5 mins
1,"Flimsy, worthless","This stand is quite a bit smaller than I'd imagined, and the metal is quite thin. I was expecting something more industrial strength, given its appearance. When assembling the stand, one of the screws would not go in all the way. I forced the nut and ended up punching a hole through the metal. One of the clamps was now loose and hanging, and the stand was no longer mobile. I might as well stack the CPU on a couple of phone books. It went straight in the garbage - not worth the effort to return to Amazon."
1,Extreme Shipping Costs,"The price of the paper looks great. However, the shipping costs were extremly high. The S&H were almost expensive as the rolls of paper."
5,I enjoy your show,"I'm not writing to review a video, I would like the address to submit a video of my son and his pet guinea pigs."
4,Solidly built mousepad,"I just recently brought the Allsop Metal Art Mousepad and I am very happy with it. The reason I brought this mousepad was that my desktop area, where I use a mouse pad, is uneven. I wanted a mousepad with a solid bottom so the top surface would stay flat. I am a online gamer, (first person shooters) and I use a Logitech MX510 mouse and was not sure how well it would track on the pads surface.So far am very please with the tracking and the mouse seems to float on the service of the mouse pad. The surface is larger then my other mousepads another plus. My only complaint is the metal boarder on the edges of the mouse pad is cold to touch."
1,why one star?,"Because it claims to be exactly what it isn't. Supposedly a superior tracking surface, for doing artwork, gaming, etc. It would be a really great mousepad --if it worked. Dragging a basic Logitech mouse over the surface, it would occasionally jump like mad, having become confused. This is probably due to the hard, semi-shiny surface (why it is like that I have no clue, as shiny surfaces are always bad for opticals). I then placed the much cheaper, same brand, mousepad which I got for a friend, on top of the metal one, and voila-- smooth and no jumping at all, the kind of thing you would expect to see in the advanced pad. Trust me, you and I would NOT want to do artwork with the metal mousepad. Yea, I'll return it either today or tomorrow...and get something more standard that actually tracks properly. *sigh* To sum up: standard cloth mousepads are your best bet still."
3,installation,"I purchased seven of these lights to go under my kitchen cabinets .These lights are almost impossible to install per the instructions. The lights mount with three screws. One screw has no access to the head to put a small ,home use, screw driver on. The other two screws require a screw driver to go on at about a 20 degree angle to the screw. Trying to turn these screws into 3/4 inches of wood holding the screw driver at a 20 degree angle is almost impossible. I feel these lights have a bad design problem when it comes to installation. The lights work very well after they are installed. Over all quality is very good."
3,Fair: Reader should be familiar with basic market indicators,"This books promotes search of futures trades with ""elephant"" moves, whether trending or in rapidly moving markets. This is not for day traders. Using the systems in this book, one would only be seeking a few trades per year (similar to Ken Robert's methods). Be prepared to do a lot of homework, filling out forms, etc. to search for trades. Also, to properly follow his system, be prepared to invest in software (i.e., METASTOCK, etc.) and at least an EOD futures data service (book recommends real-time futures data). If you don't want to do the homework, the author's company apparently provides a hotline for current updates."
2,Too Complex,"In all honesty, I didn't try the system or even try to test it. The entry consists of a checklist of 24 chart-based technical indicators or conditions for both weekly and daily prices-- thus 48 items in all. These are explained, sometimes clearly and sometimes vaguely in 19 chapters. Altogether, it is one of the most complex systems ever published. Though it may or may not work, its ""kitchen sink"" approach makes it too complex to understand well, and if there is one requirement for a good trading system, it is that the trader should be able to comprehend what he is doing and why at all times. If it starts to fail, you will never know why. While each of the technical methods presented is sound, Alexander's use of all of them at once makes for a mess rather than a good system."
2,More like 2 Star Futures,"The book started with so much promise and unfortunately, just fizzled out with very basic, very vague and ineffective TA. Just a very basic primer on moving average crosses, reversal and entry bar patterns, stochastics, MACD, OBV and some other minor items. I did find the Lindahl buy/sell pattern setup to be fairly unique .. though hardly remarkable."
1,Under capitalized trend followers: BEWARE,"The author is not as is claimed above, innovative in any sense of the word. Forget about the horrible reputation Windsor books has for one moment if you can. Let me point out one small detail the author forgets to mention in this waste of paper under the guise of a ""book"". You need at least a miilion dollars to properly trade a good trend following system. Quite a few people I am sure will become upset upon reading this. To them I can say, I hope you don't put you're life savings into your futures acount. This is a tough business. And if you are thinking that good trend following systems consist of moving average crossovers and all the other useless indicators commercial packages consist of; than I have another thing to say to you, I hope you have already paid of the mortgage on your house. Please people, leave trading to those who have the brains, time, and resources to do it right."
5,Excellent Read,"I'm on a WWII binge right now, and Lavender Road completely captured me and involved me in the lives being lived in this tiny section of London at the beginning of the war. Wonderful characters and spot-on descriptions of the suspense of waiting for the invasion make this a page turner. I couldn't put it down - I'm so happy there are sequels!"
3,A foreshadowing of things to come,"Joe Henry's long out-of-print first album should be a welcome addition to the collections of fans of the ""mid-period"" music of ""Short Man's Room"" and ""Kindness of the World."" This album is more reminiscent of those albums than ""Murder"" or ""Shuffleton"" which immediately followed it. ""Heaven"" could sure use a strong dose of the distinctive guitar playing of Gary Louris, though."
5,Finally working fans on my S2000...,"I had a problem with my S2000 where the fans would not kick on early enough. It never overheated, but I always had to run the AC to get the fans to turn on. With the new switch it finally works right!"
5,My Pups LOVE This Whimsical Plushie,"The shape and noise intrigue my pups so much so that this is their favorite plush toy overall. The toy makes an adorable soft grunting noise, is larger than I expected (which is a 'plus'), and is made of quality plush fur that does not shed. The tail is made of pink felt and so I expected it to wear quickly but even it has endured quite nicely."
4,Great solo Jazz guitar,"""Virtuoso #2"" is much mellower than ""Virtuoso #1."" This is the classic Pass style which combines chord/melody arrangements with single note passages. The momentum is occasionally broken with rubato single note cadenzas, but this occurs less frequently than in ""Virtuoso #1."" If you want to hear pure chord/melody jazz guitar pick up, ""Soliloquy"" by George Van Eps."
4,hot solo guitar,"i really appreciate this album. joe pass grooves, and i have probably listened to this version of giant steps half a million times. very much recomended for guitarists: not sure if you'd enjoy this if you don't play guitar, but hey, give it a shot: they're great arrangements of great tunes."
4,Very nice watch,"The watch arrived soon, came with a small scratch on the glass, tough, but that's no big deal, the watch looks great anyway. It's about 40mm diameter, wich I think is a good size for a men's watch. The metal is chrome-shining, not the matte look that it has in the picture. The time set and the use of the chrono function are not too intuitive, but I figured it out after reading the manual."
5,durable latch system,We have used it in our dog kennel for over a year. It has had steady use and constant exposure to the elements. It was easy to install and has been reliable.
4,Good charger,This charger works great. It charges my phone without overheating even if I leave on for the rest of the night.
1,Does not work with a Motorola Q,Even though it is advertised to work with a Motorola Q when I tried to charge my phone it said not a compatiable charger
4,perfect for what i need it for.,"ive got a decent little scooter. love to go to the grocery store, mall, etc...this lock is perfect for public locking. generally i only use it if im 'running in' to grab something quick...love the feel of it. reminds me of locks i had when i was a teenager...i use hardcore locks at home and at work, but this is perfect for around town use.love it."
4,It's ok.,I bought it last year and so far it worked well. But the color of the rubber already faded just 1 month after my purchase.
4,works,"The pictures of the product are accurate, and this lock works. The combo slides around well and its easy to use. The lock had even held up to the harsh beach environment. I haven't seen any rust on it yet. You could get a fancier or thicker lock, but I like this and would buy it again."
3,Gets the job done,I live in an area where no one would really put in the effort the break a bike lock. So yup gets the job done.
1,Not A Sturdy Lock,"The chain itself is thick enough, the only problem with this product I found was the lock. The springs inside the lock are thin and if you pull the chain while it's locked then the springs bend and the whole lock is falling apart. I wouldnt recommend buying this item as it will not prevent from stealing your bike, moreover thevies wont even need a bolt cutter to steal your bike."
3,"Bulky, but effective","This chain is rather bulky for carrying around with you on your daily commute. Furthermore, the combination dial has cheap feel and spins roughly. However, the chain has plenty of length and will effectively secure your bike."
3,required reading for all hackers,all golfers need to read roberts book to get to the reality of the game. Its a game. we sometimes tend to allow the golf gods to convince us we're in a life threatening position on the golf course. not true. take a nice slow deep breath and have some fun. read roberts book and get a tee time and have fun.
5,Especially for golfers,"The Robert Bruce Woodcox book The Golf Gods Are Laughing is the best golf book I've read. And I've read a good number of them. From a golfer's viewpoint, it's hilarious. My non-golfer spouse isn't as impressed. I'm looking forward to sharing it with my foursome, brother-in-law, sons, friends, etc. >"
5,Must reading for every golfer,"Robert Woodcox covers the full spectrum of the golfing experience in a wonderful, acrid and hilarious potpourie of anecdotes, tips, and history. Robert manages to touch (or tickle) the deepest recesses of the golfing soul in a profound way. Read it and you will come away with a true sense that you are part of the aggregate soul of golf. Robert Schenkkan C.E.O. Black Sheep Innovations Inc. (Makers of the ""Gbag""; the future of stand up golf bags)"
5,"If you play, you'll laugh!",Purchased this book at the Orange County airport where the author was signing. He has a great grasp of the futility of the process and has great fun with it in the book. At least 5 good laughs in every chapter. I can relate!!! Benjamin-a fellow addict
4,Hilarious. Lot's of laughs for the soul of the golfer.,"I recently bought this book at the L.A. Times book festival. I too am an addicted golfer. The confession, obsessions and insights of a golf addict is a most appropriate subtitle for The Golf Gods are Laughing. The funniest thing I've ever read about the game. JW. California."
5,One of the best mixes ever,I've been listening to this cd for about 5 years now and am still not bored with it. It is uptempo and relentless with a great arc.
1,nice look on the picture but not the product,"The glass bottles are full of voids, scratches, non smooth glass surfaces. I have returned mine for an exchange, but the replacement is the same."
4,amazing bag,"This is the cutest, big drawstring bag i've ever seen!!! I just got this earlier today. I couldn't tell at first if it was a big bag until I opened it up and oh WOW --- it's B-I-G!! LOL It's super cute because of the design. The only thing I worry about is the softness of the fabric because big soft bags could get a bit heavy to carry around but it's totally cute and its unique style caught my attention. I would rather leave it open when I get to use it though cause it looks kind of puffy if I lock the drawstrings (just like how it looks like in the picture). I can't wait till I get to use it!!! I fell in love with the color. I know it says coral but it looks like baby pink to me with brown handles and trim. I highly recommend this big fun bag!"
2,parts missing,Bought the latch and the 3 strikers on the left of the picture were taken out of the package and the package was retaped and sent to me. I did make the striter out of band stock but was very unhappy about it.
4,A future hidden gem,"Has this guy got a voice to be reckoned with or what? its absolutely marvellous.i dont find it easy wording how the cd makes me feel but as a whole it rarely goes over the mid-tempo mark, yet stay's uplifting,soulful and at times heartfelt. most of the track's are top shelf which leaves it quite hard to pick standout's......but at a push i'd probaly go for 'land of gold'."
5,Have You Got Your Ticket?,"The word for Shawn Smith-his music, his voice- is revelatory. My best recommendation to get this LP is that even though I've been a huge fan of this guy since Brad's ""Shame"", I'm getting it just based on the 30 second soundclips here."
2,Stupid commercial.,I can't stand it that I fell for another one of these hotwheels/matchbox sets. They always look so cool on the comercial and they are always cheap plastic out of the box.
4,Holds color a long time,"We use this paper to print scientific posters that often stay up in our hallways for years. Using this paper, they barely fade at all. If we use the semi-gloss, they fade within a few months. So while semi-gloss gives a nice look for short term purposes, like taking a poster to a conference, this ""cheaper"" paper is much better for long-term use."
5,Cool Dog: with Rainy & Jimmy,"Cool Dog is a movie with Rainey & Jimmy, Jimmy is a ten-year old to bring Rainey a twister. Rainey, is a dog which Jimmy loves so much. In the end of the movie, Rainey was died who had Jimmy to resumed his dog. His family was going New York (N.Y.)A friend and Rainey walked and 2 N.Y.P.D. (POLICE MAN) NEW YORK POLICE DEPT."
1,Missing,I would like to review this movie except it is kind of hard when I have not received it yet.
3,mwa.... so-so,"Possible spoiler alert.I didn't particular like this movie. Too melodramatic for me. Where's the fun in that!? Combined with some, what seems to me unneeded and totally phony fantasy. Why did Rainey need to drive a car? But..... kids (10 and 6 yol) watched through it and had some laughs. Rating 3 stars because of that that. My 6 yol liked the scene where Rainey is shooting tennis balls at the bully."
1,My mistake.,"Probably would be a good movie for K-3rd grade. The dog was the only actor that acted like he knew what he was doing. Cannot not figure out how this should not be a freebie. Even then it's not worth it.I have to be more careful about selecting movies, I guess. Too much of an infatuation with German Shepherds to let my good sense prevail."
2,Thank goodness for the dog,"The only redeeming factor about the movie is the German Shepherd and he's the only good actor throughout. The human actors are downright awful, the writing is repetitive and predictable, and the end is simply ridiculous."
3,Clean cut kids movie but cheesy,"The acting in this movie is something to be desired-to say the least! My young kids enjoyed this movie and got a few laughs out of it. My son says he ""liked the movie and thought it was good"".It is about a boy who has to leave his awesome dog behind when he moves. The dog finds his way to the boys new place where dogs are not allowed. The boy is then kidnapped and as he is being put in a crate to be shipped to Mexico the police come an rescue him. The dog is deamed a hero by NYC and everyone is happy. My husband and I thought it was so cheesey that it was funny. I gave it an OK rating because the kids truely enjoyed it."
2,kids loved it,my 9 year olds loved it. they would give it 4 of 5 stars; me 0 of 5. this is a super dog
2,Yuck.,"My three youngest kids (16 months, 3 years, 5 years) enjoyed this movie, but my 8 and 11 year olds commented that it's ""so stupid and the acting is really bad, but the dog is cute."" I can't believe we had to watch it all the way through for family movie night. Good for little kids, but adults and older kids don't like it. The dog is the ONLY good actor in the movie!"
2,it should be called a toy,"this gun is like, 20fps it doesnt even fell like a fly touching ur skin from point blank and the baterrie runs out like the first 5 seconds. and in on goes like ten feet, but u can take off the lazer sight to use on other gunz. but the only good part about it is that it looks cool. i dont recomend this gun."
1,crappy gun,I bought this gun and was so excited to get it. When I tried it it wouldn'tshoot 20 feet and .2 gram bbs just rolled out of the barellOverall: don't buy this gun
2,bad gun,"First of all the gun is the weakest gun i have,i can shoot my self on the finger and it will only hurt about 5 seconds.Second of all the dot sight that it comes with is way off.Third doesn't shoot right half of the time,it will shoot two or one and some times it will go as far as about 3inches.Lastly the mag doesn't have a spring,so the bbs will just roll around in the mag make alot of noise and that you would have to shake it to get the bbs to fall in the gun to shoot."
1,dissapointing gun,"i bought this gun thinking that it might be pretty good for airsoft wars. turns out that i only got 3 minutes of shooting and i charged it all night. 16 hours for 3 minutes. also, a very bad range. it shot 10 yards and it hurts your ear when you shoot. i didnt like it too much at all. the flashlight was great and so was the red dot sight, and the fact that they include the screwdriver for attatching things was very helpful. the rest wasnt amazing."
4,well it a p-90,well lets start with the shipping it has good timing it got here in about three days the gun it self is a great looking gun but it is gravity fed and that sucks the scope is just a prop but it has great fps and dont be fooled the big bag of bbs it says it comes with is actually a small bag the target you get is awesome and the glasses that it comes with well you better have a small head but it is worth the money and i would buy it for myself and would reccomend it to anyone
4,Good for beginners,When you get this gun in the mail it looks better than the pictures. It seems bigger to. The shipping and Packaging could be better but the gun is very good. The one problem I have with it is that sometimes you have to shake the gun to get BB's to shoot out. very loud motor. Short sling. Its gravity fed too through the removable mag. Comes with 2 mounts one for flashlight and another for scope. Its all plastic and only fully automatic. Brand: Unkown. The seller says it is a WELL but it doesnt say that anywhere on the box. It is a good gun for begginners and backyard wars. shoots 54.6 feet. ON the box it says 18.2 yds. fps could be better. It is only 180 fps. Mag can hold 500 rounds though. Great gun for $41.95
1,Junk,"It's nice looking,has good weight, does not fire well,bolt fails too return most of the time. I would not recommend."
4,Great entry level airsoft,My p90 arrived within a week. The magazine is removable but does not include fake bullets like Tokyo Marui. I'm happy with it.
3,Good first AEG or Prop,"This Gun is Astheticly pleasing, it looks futuristic and the plastic isn't too terrible. The attachments are cheap and don't really serve a purpose, they are CHEAP plastic. The supressor is there just for looks, the red dot is poor, and the flashlight is bright if you get a working one. The gun shoots okay, low FPS (.12s are okay to use with this) accuracy is okay for a plastic gearbox, NOWHERE near as much accuracy as a marui or a JG, but alright for a cheapsoft AEG. the magazine is gravity fed so: ""cover me i'm reloading!"" *SHAKE*SHAKE*SHAKE*.Pros:Good-LookingOnly Cheap P90 on the marketCons:Plastic gearboxLow FPSGravity fed magazineMediocre accuracyAll in All get this if you want a p90 but can't afford a Kart, Echo1, or JG. This is in no way a performer."
2,Pretty bad gun,"This gun may be good for a beginner. For like shooting cans and stuff. This gun sucks out at battle. The bb's don't shoot out some of the time. You kind've have to point the gun down to get all the bb's to come out, which restricts you from aiming. Plus the gun feels too light for me and feels like it's made out of cheap plastic. However, the bb's do come out fast. Not hard though. Unless you really like P-90s and their rate of fire and don't want to pay much, I would look somewhere else."
2,You get what you pay for,"I wish i had not wasted money on this terrible piece of garbage. the silencer makes the gun more inaccurate, the bullets go 15 feet and the red dot sight is mounted to high on the gun. Please buy something else, save your money you don't need this piece of garbage right now."
3,sucked,i got it for the sight and flash light but the gun sucks so get a good amount of mid caps for it
2,"Buy it for looks, not function.","First and foremost, the gun I received isn't what I bought. It looks slightly different than the pictures in the ad, and the box says ""Well D-90"" instead of P-90. That having been said, the gun that was delivered actually looks a bit better than the displayed pictures (the orange barrel is smaller/less noticeable).My overall impression: The gun looks good, as a costume accessory. When you charge it and fire it without batteries, the mechanical firing mechanism makes a decent (if a bit loud) automatic fire sound. But it doesn't fire AirSoft ammo well at all. The gravity-feed design feeds poorly, so any attempts at automatic fire really come out as intermittent sputtering of BBs.I would recommend this *only* as a costume accessory... if you want something that fires BB's, I would recommend you pass this one by."
3,dont use .12 gram bbs,"Gun shoots ok. Shoots terrible with the 12 gram bbs. The 20 grams make for better shooting, but the thing that sucks about this gun is that it doesn't feed bbs consistently and it jams a lot. I probably wouldn't buy this gun, go for something with a feeding clip."
3,P-90 review,Not the best gun. clip has a high ammo capacity but rattles loudly when you move it and you have to tilt it back to fire It says 30$ but with S&P costs 55$ :( Good attachments. flash light is great so is scope target is cool. with scope or laser on it is hard to accurately aim because the tac. rail is set too high. Good buy if you don't mind the stealth disadvantage.
2,Decent Replica - Bad Airsoft - You get What you Pay for,"I purchased this airsoft after being a longtime fan of the Stargate series. Unfortunately there is really no middle price break for a P90 Airsoft, you either have the $30~50 range or the Toyko Mauri at ~$300. If you are looking for an airsoft that can play reliably at large games (similar to paintball) please purchase something else. The range is terrible, accuracy is also terrible, and the bb's are gravity fed into the back of the clip. This means that you have to hold the gun level or nose up to get any bb's to feed.Pros:1-1 Scale Replica of a FN-P90TR as seen on StargateLow PriceShoots BB'sROF is decentCons:Accuracy is terribleRange is terribleBB feed is terribleConclusion:You get what you pay for."
4,pretty good,"NOTE: ONLY REASON THIS IS KIDS REVIEW IS CAUSE I BOUGHT ON ANOTHER ACCOUNT.this gun is pretty good when charged, but my charger came broken so i had to use my bro's charger. what amazed me though was the shipping cause i got this 2 days after i ordered it. when charged this gun works very well, though not REALLY powerful, its powerful enough to get the job done. it not a good long range gun, but its not close range, its middle range. this gun does mess up after a few shots, such as a dud shot ( shot that doesnt go far), innaccurate shot( its not a real accurate gun, it just someetimes messes up and gets very innacurrate), or it doesnt shoot but shoots next shot. this gun isnt very accurate, not made for accuuracy, but its still kinda accurate. overrall, i would recommend getting this gun, but if youre really looking for a very good gun u should get like a tokyo marui or classic army gun theyre good but expensive."
3,meh,So the well p90 is an ok gun to screw around and play with but for airsoft it kinda sucks. I knew full well when buying it and i put no blame on airsplat. The gun has a gravity feed clip that i worthless and so i bought a high cap wind up for it but sadly it doesnt fit. this gun only works with th clip that comes with it. if you want a p90 for serious airsofting but dont want to spend too much get a Kart P90 and if money is no issue dont get anything but tokyo marui or classic army. other than that the gun is sturdy and well made only downside is gravity feedPS the laser is not a laser pointer but a laser dot scope.
2,dont buy,unacurate it probaably curves bu 45 degrees after about 3 or 4 meters magazine must be the worst of its kind i had to modify mine on the first day to make it usable however it is a good test subject for modifications its chaep can be as low as 20 dollars and it has a lot of unused space inside
3,Buy with caution,"This is an ok airsoft gun for the causual or begging air soft player. The range is not as long as indicated. It is ok for a back yard match or close encounters. Of course the weapon it is molded off of has the same weaknesses.I purchassed two of these at the same time. One was perfect, the second one had 2 major defects. On the defective airsoft gun, it had to major defects. The Red dot would not work, and the Silencer would not screw on do to poor workmanship.Also the red dot scopes are for looks, you cannot adjust the aim point.I would not suggest this product except of you were buying for looks"
1,this gun sucks it has about 100fps,this gun sucks has only got 100fps do not get suppreser does nothing no suprise theredo not get gun is bull crap
5,its good enough,this gun is worth the $38-$39 you'll endup paying with shipping b/c it has the 500 round mag.u can go through a whole day of airsoft and never have to reload.(trust me). it ok on accuracy. it deoends alot on what ammo ur using. dont use .20 gram or higher or it will have very short range(20-30 feet) but if u use .12 or .16 gram it will be good range and decent accuracy. th only thing about this gun that i dont like is that itfeeds the bbs into te gun near the rear of the gun so u have to point the muzzle ito the airto feed more bbs in and u cant fire straight down for more than 5-10 shots. other than that its a good deal especcially with te bb trap and flashlight and everything.
1,"Looks nice, but that about all.",The package for this came in quickly and I was very excited to open it up. The body of the gun is rather nice and feels good when holding it. after fiddling with the gun and it's accessories I hurried to get it charged so i could play around with it. Sadly after I did charge it I was soon regretting purchasing this.I had seen that feeding would be a problem with the way the BBs are stored but did not expect it to be as bad as it was. Mine seems to jam or quit feeding after 2 BB fly out.The range and power are absolutely pathetic. I was only able to leave some dents in the included paper target even at close range. At first I was getting the around 25 feet per shot but that quickly turned into 5 feet. I thought it may just be that the battery was not completely charged but after waiting an additional 4 hours it still produced the same underwhelming effect.Bottom line; This gun Looks nice and feels nice but performs terribly
2,Well P90,This gun is terrible. The first day I got it it jammed then I found out to never use the crappy bb's that come with the gun. A while later I fixed it and I used good bb's. It shoots ok but all the trouble I went through made it a bad buy. The customer service I got from airsplat was terrible. But if you are looking for an ok CQB gun this might be it if you use good bb's.
1,"anyone planning on buying this, read it","ok ok im not scott, im jake, his son. ok first of all, ive bought this gun. worst mistake of my life. the manal is in chinese, the stupid magazine does not feed, it rattles. the range on this is 50+ feet, the fps is so low i literaly can catch a bb coming at me. w/ 1/8 g bb's (.12g) there is no accuracy. they just zip and wobble in every direction. the construction is so chinsy i cn break the gun by squeezing it between my hamstrings. i will tell u that seriously, with my knoledge of airsoft, 3 nine volt batteries, 3 old alarm clocks, 1cm copper tubing, red and black wires, a low torque compression spring, and a 1/4 horsepower clockwise motor (as well as some tape [electrical and maskinng]) i culd make a better airsoft gun."
4,Great Gun,The gun is great i have no problems with it. I did a test about fps problem people say.At a range it shot 200 fps with 0.12 gram BB's and it shot 300-400 fps with 0.20 gram BB's. so i prefer 0.20 gram BB's. any way the gun is awesome so get 0.20 gram BB's
5,Airsoft Well P-90 w/ Red 'scope' Laser sighting,"The P-90 is a really easy to operate, one piece functionality unit. The mock scope is a amber ""plus"" symbol, which is not projected, but rather a line of sight kind of addition. I found that this replica design definitely mirrors the real one plenty good. The push rate of fire was much more than expected, and the mock suppressor definitely assisted in adding some additional distance. The top loader 'cartridge' well holds a surprising amount of 'ammo', to keep your firing rate on a level of top output. I would suggest rubberizing your units casing though. I made the mistake of leaning this temporarily, only to have it fall over, damaging the battery door, and 'suppressor', but I'll be happy to buy another and use this one owned for a banger one or for back up parts. I would also suggest buying lots of ammo, because this baby blazes!-Shinobi 009"
2,"Weak, BB's don't flow, and inaccurate","This is my first ever BB gun purchase and I am pretty disappointed with the 200 ft/s speed. Adding the ""silencer"" doesn't help accuracy at all and the BB's tend to stray off target. The bullet drop effect is huge on this gun since it is very weak. The only good thing is the price since it's pretty cheap."
3,p90 review,this gun is good the goggles are their comfortable and the targets good as well as the gun its self.The one big flaw is the mag its a 400 round mag and tilting the gun up to keep shooting so i think you should buy at least 3 68 round mags.Also buy a speed loader just in case.Other than the mag its a realy good gun.The flashlight is good the scoope isn't the dies quickly on the scoope.
3,OK for a toy,I got this for my teenage son to shoot targets in the back yard. It works ok but it really has no accuracy to speak of. He usually resorts to full automatic and then sprays the cans and targets to knock them down. I'm also not real sure about the charger as I think there is no automatic monitoring in the circuit and can probably damage the batteries from overcharging. The psuedo-English instructions were also quite comical. Overall it's OK for a toy.
2,STARTER ONLY,"This ""gun"" is horrible if you want to go up against anyone other than your friends who have been in the sport just as long as you have-not very long. This gun will REFUSE TO SHOOT WHEN POINTED DOWN, will jam often, and is very weak, not to mention the small range. However, as far as starting weapons go, this is not bad, as it is cheap, Comes with nigh-unbreakable ""goggles,"" although they are a bit smaller, and the battery charges VERY fast, whatever the box-which is mostly in chinese or broken english-says. Not to mention the target works, and the broken english the instructions are written in is actually good for a laugh."
2,P90 Review by Scout Sniper,"I got this P90 in September of 2010. When it came I as so excited because it was my first airsoft gun. It was sunny that day so I went outside to try it. After that I was very disappointed because it is not a very powerful gun, the silencer sucks, and the scope is inaccurate. In the description of the gun, it didn't have a velocity. I'm guessing it's about 250 fps with .20's and 200 with .12's. The only good thing about the gun is the battery life is very good. I would not recommend this gun to a friend"
5,"Brilliant Comedy, If You Can Fog a Mirror You Will Laugh Out Loud","Louis C.K. is in a league of his own, even other comics recognize this. As for this performance, I have seen it a handful of times and still laugh till I am teary eyed. If you are at all a fan of stand-ups then Louis C.K. is someone you should become familiar with, and Hilarious makes a great jumping off point into his other (equally faunny and accessible) works (Louie, Shameless, Chewed Up). Bottom-Line a Must Own for fans of comedy."
3,"ok, not his usual great.","I found this stand up special much less funnythen Chewed Up and the other one. Still good...maybe it was 'cause some of the bits he'd already done.Not actual much HILARIOUS stuff on this one, but still funny."
3,"OK, but not his best...","This is an OK performance by Louis CK. It falls short of some of his better work. If you haven't seen ""Chewed Up"" and ""Shameless"" not to mention a lot of stuff you can find on Youtube, start there first. ""Chewed Up"" and ""Shameless"" will have you rolling with laughter through the entire performance. I found myself not laughing as much or as hard with ""Hilarious"" which is a shame because I was looking forward to this for a long time. It definitley has its moments and he is still a brilliant comedian in this. I would prefer ""Hilarious"" over almost any other comedians performance, but it falls just sub-par for Louis in my opionion."
3,Meh...,"I'm pretty surprised to see all the 5 star reviews of this special, because for me, it was ok. Louis CK is an extremely funny dude, but I felt this material was a bit raw. It's like he had the outline for a good show, solid topics and all, but then just went on stage and was winging it. The setups were there, but when it came time for the punchline, it just didn't pop. An example from the beginning of the show was the Hitler vs Ray Charles comparison. That had SO much potential, and it was kind of funny, but he could have done more with it. Some jokes had my dying, but most of the special seemed to drag. An hour and 24 mins is a LONG special too, so that could be part of the problem. That's a ton of time to fill. I'd much rather a comedian do a shorter set and have me rolling the whole time, than give me an hour plus of OK material.If you already like Louis CK, its worth checkin out, but don't expect to be blown away. If you are knew to him, start with ""Shameless"" - that special is top-notch."
1,"Great performance, poor media choice.","My beef is not with the content, but with the way I chose to view it. Amazon instant video is aweful. Your only aloud to view it on your pc, kindle, or other portable devices. You can't burn it to a dvd. What did I pay $10 dollars for? For $10 dollars I should be able to do what I want with it. Who are they to control what I do with it. F*** Amazon instant video! I will just buy dvd's from now on."
1,Faulty dvd,"If I could watch this DVD, I would give it a different review, but considering this disk could not be even read it's hard to do so. No, it not the region of my DVD player as I have a brand new Blu-ray, and the other DVD I purchased with this one worked fine. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to this guys comedy based on recommendations.It's also disappointing that it won't allow you to send a review in with zero stars. The one star in this review is in fact a 'zero'.Cheers"
5,Hilarious,"If you want to laugh until there are tears coming from your eyes and you abdomen hurts, this will exceed your expectations."
5,Timeless!,"C.K. does it again with such a classic stand up of his style. It will never grow old with me and I can watch it time after time. The way that he relates such topics to everyone else in the world, including me, is key. His look on life to show what is funny is unique and I am glad to see that he has succeeded in the last couple of years. He deserves the honors and is humble about it. His stand up never gets old and I will continue to listen and watch his work."
1,Northville Cemetery Massacre,"I'm not into these kind of movies anyway. Bought the movie because my husband is singing the last song at the end of the movie about truckers. But if you like ""B"" movies about Bikers then this is your movie."
2,Two Stars For Mike Nesmith,"The only reason I purchased this DVD was to hear the musical score written by ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith. Apparently, the producers of this low budget bomb approached Nesmith asking if he could create the score for free. He was so taken by their nerve that he agreed. It's the only redeeming aspect of the film. The acting - if that's what it's called - is quite painful as is the plot. The cover of the DVD boldly states ""the ultimate biker flick"". Thanks, but I'll stick with ""Easy Rider"". Anyway, here's a quick synopsis: ""The Northville Cemetery Massacre"" is a terrible movie featuring an interesting music score by the most underrated songwriter of all time.So just roll with the flow wherever it goes even if it rolls out of here.....la de da........."
3,The Good the Bad and the Ugly,"The Washburn AB10 Thinbody Acoustic Bass plays very well, which is the Good. But it has no where to put the shoulder strap, which is the bad. I called the Washburn company and they were no help at all, which is the ugly."
4,A famous county regiment,"A brief 196 page on the history of the Herefordshire Regiment. Includes many black and white photographs, 16 maps, and 5 appendices. These include the Roll of Honour, Honours and Awards, Lineage, Succession of Honorary Colonels and Commanding Officers, Camps and Services. WW1 and WW2 are covered in some detail. This is the book to have for this regiment."
3,She outdoes herself again,"Cathrine Fisher is one of my favorite authors, and she makes world full of history and myth, making a one-of-a-kind story.But it' rather confusing, with two theives, Jackal and Fox, and everyone knows that i can't keep two people with similar names straight, and conversations are realistic, but you can't be sure who's talking when.Another problem is the strange mix of ideas and contridictary remarks the different characeters make, escpecially Seth, the Scibe.Never the Less, most of the story progresses smoothly, and it remains capitvating the entire way through. It's also mysterious with gods and hidden gardens, and fallen stars.If a man plans to fail and he achieves it, has he succeeded?-loser anonymous"
4,Judging a book by its cover,"I hadn't read a real tried-and-true historical romance in quite some time, and I have to be honest - I only picked this book up because of the cover! It caught my eye and I figured, 'why not'? And I'm glad it had such a pretty cover, because it was a very enjoyable read. There was a slight supernatural slant to it (it is the last one in a series about the Talisman Ring), but it was minor and you could really ignore it if you wanted. The characters were wonderful, and the plot (though a predictable romance) was fun and engrossing. Anyone who likes Julie Garwood, Catherine Coulter, Julia Quinn, or Amanda Quick will probably enjoy this book. I'll most likely read more by this author in the future, and would recommend them to anyone who's a fan of this genre."
4,"Very enjoyable, if not perfect","Perhaps not quite as good as I'd anticipated -- I've loved the series -- but still very enjoyable. Marcus is overly starched and emotionally repressed. But the St. John talisman ring, Honoria Baker-Sneed, and a ridiculous coachman come to his rescue -- whether they mean to or not. Honoria is a remarkable woman, taking care of her brood of younger siblings, who add a marvelous element to the story. In Honoria, Marcus has met his match -- but he almost loses her because he can't ""get in touch with"" his emotions. There's little trust between them early on, and plenty of misunderstandings, but eventually of course, they manage to work it out."
3,Very good,I think Karen Hawkins humour is why I keep reading her books. I can't seem to put them down. I enjoyed this one immensely.
5,Enjoyed the book.,"I love Karen Hawkins and tried to read almost all of her books.Her characters, both the men and women, are strong."
4,Really good compilation!,This is a really good compilation by the Longines Symphonette Society. I enjoy my copy very much.Track Listing:Love Child - Diana Ross and the SupremesI Was Made To Love Her - Stevie WonderEvery Little Bit Hurts - Brenda HollowayAin't No Mountain High Enough - Marvin Gaye & Tammi TerrellThe Track of My Tears - Smokey Robinson and the MiraclesMy Guy - Mary WellsAsk the Lonely - Four TopsDon't Mess With Bill - The MarvelettesDo You Love Me - The ContoursHere I Am Baby - Barbara McNair
5,one of Frank's Reprise best,"This is a must own, whether you are a Sinatra fan or not. September of My Years and Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim (my favorite all time album by anyone!) are Frank's best on Reprise. Put on ""When the Wind was Green"" or ""It was a Very Good Year"" and pour yourself a libation, then just take it in. Marvelous! I've many favorite vocalists, but Frank is in a class by himself! Recommendations on the Capitol years are ""Only the Lonely"" and ""Come Fly with Me."
5,Magnum Opus,Possibly the greatest concept album even recorded. A tightly selected group of songs about the panoply of emotions stirred by turning 50 or 60. Essential and superb. The remastering is excellent. This album proves why Sinatra at his bestis by a large margin the greatest singer ever.
4,September of My Years,"I'm a big fan of Frank Sinatra, and I think that this album is one of his best. RG Marr"
5,Romance at it's best!,"My mother bought this album for me many years ago because it contained my favorite Frank Sinatra song: It Was A Very Good Year. I replaced it with the CD and have recently began playing it when my husband and I are enjoying time in our hot tub. Candles, moonlight, the stars, and Frank -- it doesn't get better than that!"
5,September of my years / Sinatra,"This is probably the best CD ever made by Sinatra !He is in great voice, mature and so fabulous --as usual note his phrasingyou Will Love it !"
5,Perhaps Sinatra's last indisputably great album. . .,"I am an avid fan and collector of Frank Sinatra's recordings. While he certainly had other great moments later in his career, he never again recorded an entire album of this quality, in my opinion. ""September of My Years"" is a must-own album for adults of all ages and most musical tastes.Most of the songs are classics in their own right, but it is Frank's stunning readings of them that brand the songs as his own for all time. His finely aged voice is in impeccable form (as good as on his greatest recordings for Capitol), and his interpretations are as masterful as any he ever did. No one except Billie Holiday, in my opinion, put a song across as effectively or sincerely (no pun intended) as Frank. Also, Gordon Jenkins' arrangements are an ideal complement to Frank's vocals.Buy this album. You will not regret it. It is, perhaps, one of the greatest sets of recordings by any 20th century artist."
5,"Ah, ol' Blue Eyes' best","This has to be Sinatra's best album, perfect for us ""baby boomers"" who remember the past with nostalgia. Great listening if you can endure the memories..."
5,Simply the best.,"I have over 400 Cd's of all types of music. I have to rate this particular work by Frank Sinatra and Gordon Jenkins (arranger), as SIMPLY THE BEST.Frank was the master of the melancholy song. ""Once Upon A Time"", arranged to fit Frank's style, is a masterpiece. Also, ""When The Wind Was Green"" is a beautiful song. All the tracks are a testament to Frank Sinatra's great talent."
5,LOVE IT! the best Sinatra album Ive heard,"close to turning 50 myself, these songs bring to heart a man's journey. Sinatra is at his best here, so happy I found it"
5,The Crooner,What can I say about Frankie that hasn't already been said? Loved to see him in the musicals. His voice makes you melt.
5,Love it.,I love the ballads and Sinatra does them best. Love this album. Why do these ratings REQUIRE a certain number of words?
1,didn't get it.,"never got the book, and was never contacted or replied to about why my book was never sent."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"I had to return this book because the instructor changed the text and he refused to grant me a refund because I didn't give him notice 5 days after receiving it. I had to file a claim with Amazon and then he agreed to refund it, minus a 30% restocking fee. So, now I waiting to see that refund come through.Amazon was great and gave me a $20 discount on my next purchase. BUYER BEWARE!of this seller he is not a fair business man. I would deal with Amazon directly, they were great in handling this situation."
1,What!,My book was literally in two pieces. It falls apart and I can't take it to school because I am afraid I will lose a piece. Will not rent books from amazon again
4,Delivered as described,Received quickly !!!!! and it is in great shape. Seems Im missing the DVD that came with it to do some studying. Other than that would order again from seller
3,Psychology,"Said it was a hardcover book that I was ordering, but when I received it it was paperback. That was the only disappointing thing, because I ended up paying way to much."
5,Psychology texbook-Great Reading!,I bought this book as a text for my psychology class. Book is great! Delivery was faster than expected. Great service~good price!
2,Watery but cheap,"I thought this was a great deal for the price but it's a little watery , looks to be about half strength"
3,OK,"If you liked the TV series, you will enjoy seeing the episodes again. It is an easy, no-brainer way to wind down."
5,"Bright, lively, short pieces","I have used several songs from this CD as beginning choreographies for my students. They are short, with well-defined phrasing and verses that are easy to choreograph. I have also used several numbers (including the fun drum solo!) for restaurant and hafla dancing, and the audience always wakes up for these perky Lebanese pieces!"
1,Trash,"Yep bad , broke in less than 30 daysStay away from this one.. Have 3 wireless receiver connecting both sides of the house, those work well, not as fast as promised.."
5,Looking forward to watching,"Billy Asad is a wonderful teacher. This DVD is much anticipated, I'm looking forward to watching it for the first time!"
5,eagle pendant,I ordered three different eagle pendants from three different vendors on Amazon.com. They all were delivered on the same day and were all very pretty. Thank you for quick delivery and fine products.
3,Good,A little flimsy but will work for what I need it for.Have to be careful so as not to break the little drawers.
1,Arrived Damaged,"We ordered 4 of these, 2 of them arrived with cracked frames. It's not worth the hassle to return them and they're functional but definitely very flimsy. Be careful with filling drawers too high as they will get stuck and contents will end up in drawers below."
3,"Kinda flimsy, but works good if using lighter objects","I bought one of these to store a wide variety of coins. It has good sized trays to store several various items in it but is not made to be fully loaded in my opinion. I have it about 1/2 full of coins and the top part is already bowing a bit. If you have something lighter to store in it, it would work absolutely great. Anything heavier than a bunch of coins is out of the question. Hope I'll be able to fill it up."
5,Very Nice Chain Lock,Item arrived very quickly. It was easy to install. It looks nice and I am very happy with the results.
2,Not worth it,"Mostly Hollywood. I would have liked it to be more focused on foreign --at least Spanish-speaking-- cinema. Very disappointing. It does have a good broad amount of Anglo cinema and it would allow readers to adopt better phrases and words to talk about plots. The descriptions are not critical. Merely summaries of plots that you can get from imdb, wikipedia, etc."
3,Sundry Puzzles,"This is a little book filled with puzzles. The majority of them are vocabulary-related puzzles that involve unscrambling letters. Some of them are math-related puzzles that involve pre-algebra. Some are logic puzzles.There is a puzzle for every day of the year, and answers in the back. The answers include a % of Mensa ""testers"" that were able to answer the questions.I keep it in the bathroom. Most of these puzzles are a little too easy. With a pencil and paper, most of them would be achievable for a bright sixth grader. An adult who is interested in puzzles will complete the majority of these puzzles in their head in a few seconds. This is probably because the book is quite old, and most of these puzzle ideas have been taught in school for a while, now, so... the ""puzzle"" part is stale."
5,Creative pleasure!,I have purchased several of the Mensa books. There is a challenge to outwit the Mensa and I offer it to my friends on occasion in the form of a game.
1,Book for my grandson,My grandson is a very intelligent young man. He is in his first year of college and I am sure he'll be a candidate for MENSA when he gets a bit older. He loves the book.
3,Meh,I've been reading these daily puzzles for a few weeks and they're ok but not great. Some of the puzzles are too easy and I've read several that have more than one correct answer but the answer key in the book only shows one.
1,Age of Lavazza coffee pods,"I have just received my box of Lavazza Espresso Point Aroma Point Espresso pods from Aroma Cafe Culture Inc. They were produced in Italy on February 11, 2009. Aren't these coffee pods too old already?"
3,Nine kills and then suicide.,"Graf Spee was a pocket battleship (12,000 tons) that raided freighters and convoys. Since she had heavier armament than most guard ships for convoys, she was considered a menace to merchant marine shipping. The Graf Spee was a dedicated ship and at the start of war, she sank 9 freighters without a loss of life. Then she met the one heavy and two light cruisers sent by the British to hunt her down. She severely damaged the Exeter, but could not shake the two light cruisers. She stayed in Montevideo harbor until forced out and then scuttled herself. The opposing forces must have breathed relief, since she outclassed all of them in fighting ability.This is a story of the pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee. It is a good, though sometimes tedious read about the three month exploits of a raider on the South Atlantic ocean. A nice read of World War Two."
4,Ello Review,"Ello is a very creative toy that lets kids use their imagination. With Ello, you can make other things becides people. You can make Frames, knick-knacks, a small shelf to hold small objects, and anything else you can think of! My sister and I have been playing Ello for 3 years, and we still use it!"
4,Above review is a lie,"The above review says this is the best nirvana story he's ever read. Well this isn't a story, its a guitar book. It tells how to play Bleach album on guitar."
4,Thought-Provoking Dance Music,"I had forgotten why I liked this album until I listened to side 2 of my cassette. Favorite track: ""United"". I remember when I would constantly play this track and none of the others! I am not one to suggest purchasing an album on the strength of one song, but this would be the exception. There are other tracks that are worth an honorable mention: ""Let It Reign"" and ""Pennies From Heaven"". They are sure to rock your speakers."
2,Too narrow,"I don't have thick legs (I'm a male), but these pads are way too tight. Supposedly they are adult size, but maybe they're sized for adult women."
4,Perfect slide,"These slide great on the gym floor, my only issue is that contrary to other reviews I think they are kind of big around my knee and I constantly am re-adjusting in between plays. But I can slide like 5 feet which is really great for the rec league I play in. At first they are pretty stiff too, its almost hard to bend your knee, but after one or two uses they break in pretty well. Also love that they are pink :)"
1,Too hard,"For my purposes, I needed a cushion. This knee pad is nothing like a cushion. More like a flexible plate."
5,Grammaire progressive du francais,"Though the grammar is not so entertaining subject, but with this book you'll find it much easier to study it. Plenty of consolidating exercises."
3,drawback- no answer key,Good book but without the answers it forces you to purchase another book and go back and forth between the two. I prefer Hachette books which include the corrections.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this truck in March for a child's birthday in July. Gave the gift and it doesn't work not at all. Changed batteries tried everything and just won't work. I contacted seller and they will not refund my money because it has been over 90 days even though the truck is trash. I wouldn't buy this item or from this seller again.
5,Great multipurpose pot!,"Although this pot was designed as a soup pot, I use it for lots of things--soups, stews, chili, curries, noodle dishes, etc., because it is so easy to serve from--lots of room to get a ladle or large serving spoon in and out of. It is a great addition to my Le Creuset collection. This was the usual outstanding purchase transaction I have experienced with Amazon--they kept me informed every step of the way, shipped the item immediately, and the item was received in perfect condition."
3,critter cruiser-hamtrac combo,"I bought the critter cruiser first, and I love watching my zoe zoom around in it, she goes fast, so she crashed a lot, but I thought by buying the hamtrac it would be a perfect combination, unfortunatley not.. if your hamster is like mine, loves to go fast the critter cruiser will slow them down, they don't turn well on the trac, and it becomes frustrating for your pet, and for you. Take the wheel out of the cruiser, and that works fine even if the hamster goes fast.. but sometimes it might fall over, you have to watch over it.cautiously.."
3,"Looks cute, doesn't work",My gerbil is entirely incapable of pushing this little car along on carpeting. This may work better on the ham-track or linoleum but will not move on a medium pile carpet.
2,It's okay...,"I bought it because I thought it was really cute, and I thought my hamster would love it. Once I got it home, I put my hamster in it and he didn't have any fun with it. It only goes forward and backwards, it breaks really easy, its difficult to clean, it can't go over bumps, and it is hard to get your hamster out of it. With the money I spent on this, I could have got a hamster ball, hamster food, and some bedding. Trust me, do not get it!! It is a waste of money!!"
1,Not worth it!,Overprice plastic junk. Hard to get small pet back out. Cheap item w/ expensive price. Should have returned but little girl really wanted her mouse to have a car. Ended up in the trash as it was trash in a few weeks!
2,Hamster didn't like it.,"Our hamster didn't like this nearly as much as he does the ball, it does look cool, but for actual use, I would just go with the ball!"
2,cheaply made,"Cheaply made, the center of the car was wider than the width of the wheel and it didn't even touch on both sides in order for it to fit into the half moon shaped holes. I read it said it ""snapped in"" into what? It did not snap into any holes, growl grumble grr, in fact it looked as if it relied on the the car to squeeze it together in order to hold it up let alone hold any other weight. Do not waste your money. I gave it a two just because it was cute ;)"
4,"Very cool, but not for rats!","The cruiser arrived promptly and in great condition. They sent me a blue car, which was lucky since it was a present for a boy! The only problem was that I had been hoping it would work for his rather large pet rats - it did not. Be forewarned if you are hoping to cram other critters besides mice or small hamsters into this car!"
4,Definitely worth the price!,"My kids absolutely love this car! In fact just about every kid on our block seems to love it too. I read the reviews before I ordered ours so I was prepared for it to be made of thin plastic. For the price its to be expected, so I'm sure to be the one to put the hamsters in and out of the car instead of the kids. The website doesn't clearly state that the color may vary. Ours is yellow, not the pink I was expecting. It works well and none of our hamsters have had any problem using it. The only issue now is that the kids want more so the hamsters can race!"
1,Junk -- doesn't work on Hamtrac,"This doesn't really work on Hamtrac. We made the recommended adjustments and it just doesn't operate--it falls over. My daughter won't let me return it, but it's only good for using on a long, flat floor. Save your money and buy the plastic balls."
1,piece of crap,this toy fell apart in a day...barely even used it. really bad product...buy this if you like throwing your money down the drain
4,A cute pet critter cruiser,I thought the car was adorable. I think my granddaughter's hamster likes it too. It seems durable and the bright color is attractive.
4,Need a taller hamster!,"My three year old loves this for his hamster and it is a riot to watch both him and the hamster. However, it only goes forward and backward and the hamster can't see where he's going. But they both still love the activity!"
4,My book fell apart too,"Is there a reason why the don't make spiral bound songbooks? I know it doesnt look as nice. But, it seems it would function better that way."
5,Tori Amos is a gifted writer and a rain drop from a cloud of mystery,"Sometimes I question whether or not Tori Amos is a genius or not, however when i first listened to this album I was blown away by her sense of pure honesty and profound goodness, her words speak to the soul and hang from the heart and her memorable gentle touch is brilliant. She is a wonderful pianist and her lyrics are vivid, intense and often overwhelming although her music never fails to amaze me. I believe my favorite songs on this Cd are Crucify, Girl, Precious things, and Little Earthquakes. Her ability to use her words to blend the truth together has inspired me."
1,Dull.......,"In these four movie sets from The Midnight Horror Collection, there is usually one film thats fairly good, while the rest stink. This set, by far, is the worst collection to date.There are bad movies that entertain, then there are bad movies that never should have been made. That's this set, save for one.The one that's just ok is The Dead Sleep. It's a bizarre story that tends to lose itself from time to time in it's complicated plot. It's about a guy who has been dead for five years that dreams his way back to his daughter to explain clues he left when he was alive and was haunted by his own ghost, which in reality he was being dreamed of as the ghost five years later. Did I hear you just say ""What?"""
4,TRACK LISTING - - 8 VERSIONS:,"Tracks:1. Fantasy - (extended mix)2. Fantasy - (demo mix)3. Fantasy - (Masters At Work 12"")4. Fantasy - (Herbie's Hub-A-Dub)5. Fantasy - (Masters At Work dub)6. Fantasy - (Shelter 12"" mix)7. Fantasy - (Shelter 4 A.M. mix)8. Fantasy - (Funky Ginger mix)"
1,No details available,i need a hinge but I do not want to buy this one purely for lack of information. I do not see the dificulty in mking it easy to find out some particulars about the equipment.
5,"quality and price ,best on web.","only drawback, I have to drill key hole on pasenger side cover my self.thats why price is so low. Other than that I am very happy with this deal.MOHDz."
4,Jesus Diaz CD,"I like the CD very much, it arrived on time and as advertised. I love theCd and play it often."
4,Weeder that works,"This device allows for the removal of many types of garden and lawn weeds without bending over, a simple push of a spring loaded button ejects the weed. Does not work well in hard dry clay soil 'tho."
4,Still like it better than the others I've tried.,"I am about to buy my second Speedy Weedy. The first one lasted for 2 summers and I loved it. The yellow plastic housing for the prongs cracked and one of the prongs was lost. It actually works reasonably well with only two. I have since purchased a different brand of weeder with less plastic, but have not been very satisfied with it, and I have tried several other models belonging to a few of my neighbors. I am about to buy my second Speedy Weedy because it just works better than the others. I can only hope that the makers of the Speedy Weedy will see fit to produce it in the future with an alternative and stronger housing for the prongs. In the meantime, I will be a bit more cautious in the rocky areas of my property."
2,Fragile Plastic Attachment,"The four steel prongs are indestructible, but unfortunately they're attached to the handle by a flimsy piece of plastic. This tool works OK for small weeds, but if you encounter anything with a thick root the plastic can't take the strain and breaks, rendering the tool useless. This happened to me yesterday."
1,not for me,Wish I had returned it right away. In the lawn it takes too large of a clump. have not found it very effective in flower beds. The reviews that influenced me to purchase were very positive so perhaps it is my technique. I will try again but so far not impressed.
3,doggone weeds!,Speedy Weedy works ok. It seems to pull out only certain types of weeds. It does really well with dandelions. I was getting ready to chuck it cause it was too late to get a refund. The area that I live in is really bad with weeds and we have all different kinds of weeds. Sometimes it doesn't get out the whole root. All in all its ok.
5,Great for toddlers!,This series of books is wonderful for little ones. My 18 month old son has loved them since he was a year old. The large flaps are easy for him to manipulate and the he loves to act out what each page says! A must for parents of toddlers!
1,This is not near as Good as the first,"This movie was so bad I cant even tell you what it is about, I think that they could have done better with The Gates of Hell Part 2 cause I LOVE part 1. I also ordered part 1 from you guys recently I hope it is uncut"
3,"One of Fulci's ""in-between"" movies.","While not as good as House by the Cementary or the Seven Doors of Death, this movie is better than some of his earlier works like The Black Cat.It is gory, if you can get the full uncut version, but it is also boring at times as well. Many people will not be impressed with Fulci brand of filmmaking but to those who are, rent this first before buying."
4,"AGAIN I SAY THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ""DAWN"" OR ZOMBIE!","All you have to know is that this film has nothing to do with Zombie, or Dawn of the Dead for that matter. The zombies in this film are ghosts that are awaken because of a ceremony that is preformed at the beginning. The special effects are some of the best I have every seen. A woman crys blood, another throws up her own major organs.There also is a scene that involves an angry father,a screaming daughter, a terrified and helpless boyfriend, and an industrial mounted electric drill. From what I gathered from this scene, it looks like Fulci actually used a persons head to pull this fx off. It is outstanding. So if you like Fulci, and enjoyed Dawn of the Dead, and Zombie, and can realize that this film can stand on it's own to be totally original, and have nothing to do with the other two prior, then it is a must see."
3,"Liked it, didn't love it.","When it comes to horror, reality often gets thrown to the side, but the need for strong storylines and dialogue remains as it does for all movies. Being a horror junkie, I did enjoy this movie, but I was never even remotely frightened by it's ""spectacle over sense"" approach. The horrendously awful dialogue and cheesy melodrama of this flick do not lend themselves to one being sucked into the story. Gore does not a good horror make, but since the gore is SOOO extreme, this film is at least worth a gander. I would strongly recommend finding a widescreen digitally remastered copy because the pan&scan version I rented was so cropped and murky, that much of the atmospheric cinematography was simply lost. I recommend it, however, for those who saw and enjoyed the likes of Zombie, The Beyond(7 Doors of Death), and/or House By The Cemetary, all also by Lucio Fulci."
3,"Not as good as Fulci's Zombie, but has its strong points","This movie takes off to a slow start, holding too much boring commentary, as well as, a bunch of gypsy mumbo-jumbo. Once the movie gets started it has its strong points, including a girl puking her own entrails. It definitely follows Fulci-style films with gore; however, it lacks the true commentary and thrills of even mainstream flicks."
2,"Sorry Jack, Chucky's back( But not so good than in the first","Sequel of Tom Holland's Child's Play ( 1.988 )but not so good than the first one. Here, Andy is trying to find a new family when his mother is in a institucion. He find to good "" parenths "" Joanne ( Jenny Agutter from An American Werewolf in London ) and Phil Simpson ( Gerrit Graham). But, how the slogan says, Chucky's back ! And is gonna tried to pass his soul to Andy's body no matter what he must to do...."
2,You Can't Keep A murderous Doll Down,"Child's Play 2 picks up where the original left off. Little Andy has been adopted by a family(his Moom is undergoing psychiatric treatment). And, surprise surprise, Chucky has been re-created by the toy company. Little Chuck is back to life and continues his search for Little Andy. The movie is a real 'jump scare' type of movie. You know what's going to happen and where. Geritt Graham gives the best performance in this pretty mediocre and disappointing follow up to the fun original. Christine Elise, as the bad girl foster daughter Kyle, doesn't pull it off. She looks the part, but it doesn't ring true. This is a pretty messy effort. The end climax in the toy factory is a highlight. The best set piece in the entire series. Ho hum. Easily the weakest entry in the mediocre series. But wait, there would be more. A better entry will come in the form of ""Bride Of Chucky"". Not too good."
3,It was okay.....,Its not that i hate it its just not the better than the original or the bride of chucky...let me explain now can you get a more corny death than this?he kills a teacher with a 1 meter ruler!!!! but theres one cool death like the humaneyeballs crushed with doll eyeballs in the creating machine scene!and when there in the factory the story gets a little serious around chuckster!if your a chilsplay fan youll like this!(fact)in videohound 95 they gave this WOOF!which means horrible!
2,Can't hold a candle to the 1st,"It is true that sequels are inferior films. And this is a perfect example. I mean how can you watch the second and then watch this one. What a let down. Chucky 1 scared the white off me, this one was too cheesy, except the end. I think way they killed him in this one was very horror movieish. very good ending. Though, Chucky did not need any squels!"
2,Scarier than the first two!,"I thought this movie had awesome special effects, but it's not the best one I've ever seen. Little Andy (Alex Vincent) is getting stalked by his old childish Good Guy doll Chucky. He's evil and more powerful than ever! Everyone's in for a surprise!"
1,"Blah, blah, blah...don't waste your time here, unless you are a diehard ""Chucky"" fan.","Sequels should only be employed to succeed great or at least good horror movies. With the original ""Child's Play"" being an average horror flick at best, the sequel was bound to be a step down. To say that the acting in ""Child's Play 2"" is a step down is an understatment and the result is undynamic character and a movie which fails to stimulate any interest from a sophisticated horror movie audience. There is no Catherine Hicks or Chris Sarandon and the plot focuses even more on Andy and his relationship with Chucky which really doesn't work in my opinion. Overall, this movie is just plain boring and has nothing additional to offer from the original movie. For those of us that appreciate true horror cinema, avoid this movie as I do not recommend this movie to anyone but the diehard ""Chucky"" fans."
1,"Don't watch unless you really, really like the Chucky series","Well, I was never completely sure of what was the worst horror movie ever made. It's not Child's Play 2, but it's somewhere down there. This is a movie that has no style,and is basically the same as the original. As for Brad Dourif, you got admit the guy has some guts working on every Chucky movie."
1,Public Service Announcement:,"WARNING! Do not watch this movie or you will collapse with boredom You'll probably fall asleep and miss the finale,the only good part.Try Child's Play 3 instead."
5,THE BEST CHUCKY MOVIE EVER,"Chucky returns in this sequel to part 1.This one is better than part 1 and 3.the plot is better and Chucky turns more villianous than part 1.Andy lives with foster parents who are nice but strict and also a female rebel named Kyle lives their.so Chucky wants to put his soul into Andy but Andy has to save himself.the music score by Graeme Revell{Idle Hands,Bride of Chucky} is eerie and the best score.and John Lafia that made Blue Iguana makes a suberb sequel.the gore in the movie is a lot and even more violent than part 1.the best horror-comedy.Rated R for Graphic Violence and Gore and Language."
3,"Sorry Jack, Chucky's back!","This sequel picks up where the first one left off.Young Andy is now in foster care after being taken away from his mother. He still has nightmares about his killer doll.Little does he know that the company has completly reconstucted Chucky. After Chucky escapes from the factory, he tracks Andy down to his new home. He begins to do things that get Andy in trouble and nobody listens when Andy tells them ""Chucky's back"".When Chucky and Andy have their final showdown at the doll factory, Chucky finds out that it is now too late to transfer his soul. He is now human. This enrages Chucky and his goal now is to kill him.Not as good as the original, the sequal is decent at best."
4,Sorry Jack-Chuckys Back,"better than the origional, but only by a little...its faster paced and more suspensful and scary.Andy is taken into a foster home and chucky follows him and terrorizes him while his foster family thinks hes going insane.A cool movie and the ending is so cool! the acting is pretty good too and u actually like some of the characters. Chucky is more heartless in this movie than in the 1st one. Good movie. One of the best in the series"
4,Best Out Of All 4 Chucky Movies,"""Child's Play 2"" is the scariest and most suspensfully entertaining one out of all 4 Chucky movies. It has the most action, suspense, and horror along with a great plot and ending. Although you should see the first one before this one so that it will make sense."
2,"Been there, done that. And yes, the kid still sucks at acting","Almost the whole movie is about Chucky trying to become human. This isn't being creative so much as just extending the ending to the first movie. After given a new lease on life, chucky seeks out Andy and tries once again to put his soul into him. Though Chucky still has fun killing anyone who gets in his way, he somehow manages to be less creepy and more one-dimensional this time around. Not recommended."
4,"Swearing, abusive doll...is very funny!","This is funny. The ""Chuckey"" doll just keeps swearing and trying to kill people! He's a evil little thing! This would suit people aged 11-25. Not for (1) People aged 1-10 (2) People aged 26-101 (3) People older than 101. Funny, very funny!"
3,Just as funny and entertaining as the first,"Chucky gets resurrected after being torched by Andy and his mother, and he goes on a murderous rampage again in order to get the Andy again. Lots of scares and humour all the way. A worthy sequel."
3,"As a sequel, this is perfect.","As a sequel, this movie is perfect. Here, Chucky is scary as hell, there is more bloody deaths, and Don Mancini put a little more of comedy in the script. The only thing I miss in this film, is the original cast from the first movie."
2,sorry jack! an unnessary sequel,"It's been a few years since Andy's run in with Chucky.Andy has a new life with a foster family,surprise surprise Chucky comes back for Andy wanting to put his soul into Andy's body.Chucky is killed again at the end,they should have killed the series off with this one."
1,I Don't Think That This Movie Isn't Very Good For Kids.,Well...I Don't Think That This Movie Isn't Very Good For Kids.I Don't Like It That Much.I've Seen Scary Movies In My Life.Well This Just Takes The Cake.If I Had A Top Ten Of The Scariest Movies.Then That Movie Would Be Number 1.So To Make A Long Story Short.Just Between You And Me.I Think You Should Buy This Movie.And Judge For Yourself.Oh And A Little Advice.If You Had Kids.Then You Might Want To Tell ThemTo Go To Their Rooms.
5,better than the 1st,I liked this much better than the 1st but I liked the 4th much better than the 2nd. I like this one the 2nd most because I like the part when he kills the teacher. I had to watch it over and over again so i decided to buy it. Its got the best music that would keep you watching it over and over. I think this movie should be watched by all since its a great seqeul to Chucky fans.
3,"Cahill good as usual, but too short","I totally enjoyed the book, being a big Cahill fan, but was disappointed at the shortness of it for the price."
5,Great dog stories for kids,"This author is terrific for kids about 8-14. Lots of excellent dog lore, great stories. Wish there were more books available, especially his all time best, ""Lad, A Dog"". Check your used bookstores for that one"
2,Don't Waste your Money!!!,"The 38c was the first DE razor I purchased. It is a nice simply designed and solidly built piece of equipment; the problem is that for a few dollars more you can get a much better Razor. A Progress or better yet a Futur. Maybe your could just save a few dollars and get an HD; you see where i am going with this; it is just too middle of the road. If you want weight and length just get a Futur, if you want the older style get a Progress or and HD.The performance is strictly middle of the road also; it does make a great travel Razor though; you won't be that pissed if you lose it.Lose your Vision or your Futur, you might hurt somebody."
5,Back to better,I purchased this for my husband and now I need to get one for myself. I had forgotten how close these razors shave. My husband is MORE than happy with it. He thanks me whenever he shaves. great product.
4,GREAT RAZOR,"REplaced parker razor this razor seems to be better quality and gives better shave,im glad i ordered it."
5,Great Shave!,"This was my first DESR in about 30 years. I had forgotten just how hefty they can be. This particular razor has a good weight, is easy to clean and looks great. The long handle makes it easier to use for head shaving. The package includes a Merkur blade, which shaved well, although I've since switched to another vendor. If this is your first safety razor I recommend you buy a blade sampler and try a selection of vendors. There really is a difference in sharpness, ease of use and durability among them. The bright chrome finish and rotating parts are holding up well, although it takes a bit of water and some occasional polishing to keep the top plate free of soap residue and shiny.I'm very happy with the razor and I won't be going back to my old Fusion."
4,a great razor,I've never used a DE razor before but decided to make the switch when my current batch of replacement Mach 3 blades was close to running out. This razor is really easy to user and after watching some instructional videos I had no problem picking up basic wetshaving technique.The angle on the blade is just right for a close shave and even when I cut myself starting out it was never as bad as a disposable razor cut. The body of the razor is very solid and easy to hold. The weight is good and it feels like a product that will last me for years. It's way more fun to shave now and it's much smoother afterwards. Took some adjustment but after about two weeks I had no more issues.
5,A great product!,This is a great product for users just starting or that have been using a safety razor for years. Comfortable in the hand. Also you cant beat a Merkur Razor.
3,Funny but kind of corny.,"Our kids watched this without me and then said, ""It's stupid. Well, actually, it's kind of funny."" Then when I said I'd watch it myself, they sat down to watch it again with me.If you're a fan of Treasure Island movies, this will be number 4 on your top 3. Best if you can borrow it from someone or from the library but still worth watching...once."
3,"historically interesting, slightly biased show","I requested this as a gift after reading the other reviews. I thoroughly enjoy the Syfy series Ghost Hunters and thought it would be similar in nature. The episodes were more documentary-like and, while historically interesting, I thought they were biased investigations. I was entertained, but not to the point of ordering the other DVDs. Most likely, I will give this away rather than watch it again."
3,Ghost Hunters-Legends,"DVD was on one of the English Civil Wars, not US Civil War; misleading, but a good DVD all the same."
1,Ghost Hunters: Echoes from Beyond the Grave. The Possession/Priest and Professor,"I was disappointed with capital letters. Very bad ""ALL"". I do not recommend this product.Tessie Martínez"
3,VERY high energy...,I probably should have known better than to purchase this CD as it is strickly geared for YOUNG people. I gave mine to my daughter & she loves it. Not for older folks.
4,workout cd,I don't really remember what's on this one. I purchased to install in my MP3 for walking/jogging and it's fine
4,Duleek Delight,"What the product information doesn't tell you is that this is what is known as a ""Duleek"" Knot or a Knot of Protection. The actual pendant is well made and looks very nice (especially for a male) but the box chain that comes with it is only 1mm thick, which looks absolutely ridiculous against the 4.5mm pendant hole. The chain and pendant come in a ziplock bag which is inside of a green jewelry pouch of mediocre quality.This is a nice pendant to get, and Silver Insanity is a company I would highly recommend, but expect to buy a complimentary chain with the piece."
2,Economic and Technological,"I was hoping for a least a modicum of color or human interest, or some detail of what the personal dimension of steamboat travel must have been. Regretably, there is quite alot of information about boilers, water displacement, rates for moving merchandise, and every other dry statistic to bore a non-specialist. The sub-title says it all, and I should have paid attention."
4,Good microSD card,"I use this in my LG enV, and it's great. The microSD card comes with the SD adapter, and I can then transfer the files either directly to my HP desktop or to my laptop via an SD card reader."
5,Glide Floss Holder and Refills,"Like the other reviewer I found that I started flossing often where as before I didn't. I found this at my local food store sometime around 2002 and I'm still using it. I had another brand that didn't hold up, but this unit keeps going and as the other view mentioned I actually floss since owning this hand held flosser or rather the unit that these refills are used in. I was looking for the refills and see that they don't carry the product anymore, so I guesss I will make my own. I don't like flossing with just string and having my hands in my mouth, one reason why I like this hold it is stronger than the one time use flossers. Maybe the taker over team will put this back on the market."
3,Okay,"A lot of the bulk of the book is simply a list of colleges with programs and interviews with industry folks. If you are like me - already in the business - looking to learn something new, you can accomplish more just by networking and talking to folks."
3,"Not bad, vocals are severely lacking however","I love music. I especially love classical music. When I find musicians who have taken classical music and presented it in a new way, I'm always excited. EVOC has done exactly that with these tried-and-true opera classics. The orchestrations are wonderful and the musicians obviously very talented. The vocalists, however, sometimes really don't deliver. All in all, it's a fun CD and I will certainly enjoy listening to it again and again."
4,this works!!,"Kudos to the EVOC! I am a classical music nut, but my first love was RnR (which I still love, but very particular). I was delighted to find that this group's concept actually works very well. Not at all like, say, BOND...who are an insult to both classical and RnR, and to music in general.The EVOC is great fun, yet still beautiful when called for. They really know and respect the importance of artistic interity in music.The array of instruments used is highly impressive. I love the idea that they are introducing this music to many young people who may not have gotten exposed to it otherwise.Another great group who is committed to this cause is the Ahn Trio.I'm not a big opera person, but a great aria can be wonderful.MUSIC IS THE BEST - FZ"
4,East Village,I enjoyed the music and the contemporary style or interpretation of classic opera music as performed by this group. A very nice complement to the same music performed in traditional style.
2,Interesting but ultimately unsatisfying,"This is unquestionably a talented group, but to what end? There is a surprising monotony to their arrangements of these classic opera excerpts (start softly, build to power guitars, soften again, etc.) They will remind you of Queen.The revelatory moment for me was listening to the La Boheme aria Che Gelida Manina. If you know the opera, a decent recording of this area will move you. I would be surprised if the EVOC treatment had a comparable effect on anyone. It's pretty, but it's not moving. In the end this recording comes off as a novelty, without much depth. Too bad, because it seems like a lot of heart and musicianship went into it."
1,HORRIBLE!,"Anybody who likes opera and good voices should not be misled by the title. I'm glad the composers are not around anymore to hear their beautiful music butchered by a no talent rock band.If you want more modern interpretations stick with Amici or El Divo. Hate, hate, hate this album."
4,Not Yer Mom's Opera,"Make no mistake, this is not traditional opera. This cd is a rock band with a string quartet paying tribute to some well-known arias. The vocals are not florid (thank you!) and are well executed. AnnMarie Milazzo is a powerhouse. The songs rock--but not as in heavy rock or virtuouso rock. Their interpretations of these beautiful arias are done with real attitude and heart without being too over the top, maudlin and arrogant. It is clear that these musicians respect both Rock and Opera. I subtracted a * because there's some overusage of vocal chops and male vocals are at times a bit too 'Broadwayish' for my taste. If you demand perfect diction in foreign languages, adherence and rigidity then this is not the cd for you --but it is certainly much more fun than Jessye Norman's attempts to sing pop."
1,Beware of this!!,"If you have any idea of buying this C/D, think again. I can say without reservation that this is probably one of the worst pieces of junk I have ever heard. It is clear that this group of no talent wantabes decided to capitalize on the current favor that opera bands are seeing in the music world, ie the only reason I can see for opera company in the album title. A really bad,bad,effort and something anyone who appreciates good music should avoid. It is an insult to the ears and I can now see why they won't allow buyers to listen to tract samples before purchasing...."
4,An Overlooked Gem,"Wow, I just re-bought this on CD and I forgot how good this one was. People knock the John Lawton era albums, but I think they are actually better than the final three with David Byron. Heep got a shot in the arm with a new vocalist, and Trevor Bolder's bass work is outstanding. 'Wise Man' and 'The Hanging Tree' are probably my favorites, but 'Who Needs Me' is good also. The title track is a little weak and way too long though. Overall this is recommended."
4,I just like this album!,"I've read an opinion UH without Byron couldn't release such as powerful albums as with him. I don't want to argue, just have a look on album covers and see who composed most materials for UH brilliant albums. In my humble opinion Firefly is the best post-Byron era album. It is much more better then, say, Innocent Victim, High and Mighty, Fallen Angel or Conquest. Yes, both organ sound and vocal are different, but not worse than before. But, anyway, it is good old Uriah! The title song is classical final UH one, long and epic, with strong melodies and good composition. Wise Man is wonderful ballad. The rest of songs aren't bad as well. Finally, Firefly isn't a brilliant like Demons... or Birthday..., but it has a real UH spirit. Buy it!"
3,Melodic Heep,Many good songs from Hensley. This was more closer to Demons & Wizards just nothing real heavy. Lawton did 3 LP'S with Heep. When you look at the lead singers they had Heep has been very lucky they have had good pipe's belting out there songs. Yes they have been blessed by the VOCAL GODS. Maybe some of the LP covers could have had better art work but music wise? They have an always will hold there own.
4,A return to form.,"Uriah Heep ""Firefly"" #166 (1977).This was kind of a return to form for the new Uriah Heep. The 10th studio album brought in David Bowie bassist Trevor Bolder and Lucifer's Friend vocalist John Lawton. Strong moments in. ""The Hanging Tree"", played this a lot on my college radio show. ""Wise Man"", the excellent title track, the boogie of ""Who Needs Me"", a Lee Kerslake number and ""Sympathy"". ""Innocent Victim"", came out in late '77."
3,solid,"This is a solid Heep output. New frontman Johan LAwton has a great voice, and fills the shoes of David Byron appropriately. Unfortuntely, the dance of musicians would continue to plague Heep for a long time, and Lawton was soon gone, coming their weakest album to date, CONQUEST."
4,VERY VERY GOOD !!!,"Simply put, this 1977 release is hard rock at its best, played by intelligent British musicians and featuring eight songs (these are still the good old-days, when band released albuns with few, but great songs, instead of releasing albuns with fourteen to fifteen songs filled with fillers !!!!!). The atmosphere of this album is something unique, I hear the album over and over again. Very good."
4,THE BULLET HITS THE BULLSEYE!,"i've been using the bullet for years and find its ""dirty"" sound just what i need. some may feel that this mic is too heavy, but i don't think it is. and since shure added a volume control i like it even better. if there is one thing i could say about the bullet that needs changing, it's the cable. it is really not secured strongly into the mic and if you happen to accidentaly step on it while you're playing, you stand a good chance of ripping it right out of the microphone. if it wasn't for that, i'd give the bullet a five star rateing. jersey slim"
5,Awesome,This thing just howls. Absolutely no downside. Great Shure sound and fits the hand nicely. You really should get one.
2,Like holding a brick - TOO BIG FOR SO LITTLE,"I've been playing R&R and Blues harp in various bands, for about 30 years now, and I've got a bunch of different types of microphones. This is at the bottom of the pile, let me tell you! It's way TOO big and HEAVY to play for any length of time and make the moves that give your playing its tonal range. The earlier magnetic resonance 520D mics like James Cotton used to play, were interesting for their sound quality, but the Astatic D35 and other Shure mics, out-perform this ""brick"" by far.....The new Peavey might be a winner...I tried to sell my Green Bullet, but couldn't even get $50 for it on a popular auction site. Now, I wouldn't give you $10 for this ""collector's"" gem, it doesn't work for performers, but looks authentic enough ha ha! The joke is on whomever thinks this is a cool mic."
5,"Very original, the whole family ""loved it""!","I have listened to a number of original artists and found very few with the talent or originality that this performer has. If you are looking for easy listening with a message that has a beat and you can listen to any time this is it! The music is great!!! George Thomas, Los Gatos, CA."
5,Great work is by Mark Twain,"This is probably the greatest novel about Joan of Arc, the author is later revealed as Mark Twain."
2,Teach yourself Zulu,"This book is attractively printed and the tape is useful for learning pronounciation. However, I found the teaching style was not good. It jumps straight in to trying to teach all the different noun classes at once, which is enough to baffle and discourage any beginner. There are other much better books on the market, such as Phezulu, and the Sanibona series. which introduce the most common noun classes first, and teach more complicated gramma later."
4,amazing place to start if you start early,"I really do like this book. I did not know what to expect for the LSAT, and the princeton review put me at ease. It is something that I breazed through in about a week. But, the book does encourage you to use it as a supplement to other practice tests."
5,An outstanding addition to your music library!,"Beginning with the spirited first tune on this CD, ""Breezy Point"", Jane takes you on a joyful journey of established old time tunes such as ""Needlecase"", ""Rock That Cradle, Joe"" and ""Indians Et a Woodchuck"", and her own wonderfully written tunes, such as the beautiful ""Bea's Waltz"" and the delightful ""Snowcones in December"". A master of the fiddle, Jane weaves a terrific mix of tunes, accompanied by a host of talented musicians. I highly recommend this CD as a very worthwhile addition to your traditional music collection."
3,Good for the money,"These are the more generic brand of strings, they dont really have as good of sound quality as theyer making it sound. However these are good for what you pay for them, they are also a good string for beginers or students. But you would never see a professional using these and thats because they are not very good, there are better strings for when a student or beginer whants so take it to the next step. I have used these ever since I started playing the cello and I just dont think they measuer up to other brands, but for the time i started and was only begining they were a good string for my level."
2,OK for beginners,"I am a violinist of 15+ years. I remember using this brand when I first started playing. I also remember breaking strings all the time - my mother can attest to this. Once I started buying my own strings in high school I bought Dominant; though more expensive, the quality of the sound improved and the strings didn't break as often. My 9yr old sister just started playing cello. I will be gifting her a full set of Dominant strings. Oh, the joy of being the baby and getting spoiled rotten. :)"
2,Okay,These strings are definitely not the best of quality. They don't have a really warm tone and are easy to break. They do work though in a pinch.
3,Good for the price,"Sound and feel are subjective and they will vary greatly on different cello. That being said, I thought these stings have quick response and produce bright sound, as expected from steel core strings. This set of strings sounded terrible on my wife's cello. But on mine, the A and D worked very well (very similar sound quality to the more expensive Dominant or Jargar strings). I didn't like the G and C because they were too bright and had to change them. It is a good buy if you have a limited budget, as these strings are inexpensive and durable. I would recommand trying them because of the price, and trying is the only way to know if you would like them."
5,*Believe In Angels*,"I really enjoyed watching this.Makes you believe angels are watching over you.I will be giving this one repeat viewings.It gives you faith and hope.No matter what situation your life is in,always have faith."
4,Movie review,This movie is a nice Christmas movie. It is a little low budget and far fetched but it is a lighthearted Christmas movie with a great story and ending. I would recommend this movie to other Christmas movie fans like me.
1,The Christmas Past,Item unsealed and when opened found the wrong movie in it which was not the Christmas Path but Beyond Chrismtas. Will file claim.
2,Inadequate,"Well when I purchased the product the condition said Used-Like New... and when I received the product this was not the case...the first page was ripped this didn't bother me too much because it is not needed, but as you look through the book a lot of pages were crumpled as if they had been wet."
4,a book at it's best,This book is very detailed and at the same time easy to read. It is quite helpful for my bio 100 course I am taking this semester.
5,great deal,"i need this book for my college biology class. at my school they sell it for $167... but here on amazon i bought it for about $8. totally worth it. sure the corners are a little beat up, but it arrived right on time and i have no complaints. and some of the important parts of the book are even underlined by the previous owner. which is always a plus! lol"
2,Hate this book,Terrible textbook...good luck if you take a class using it. Long boring chapters that really ended up putting me to sleep....
5,A LASTING IMPRESSION,I first heard Mark Curry and this album around 1993. Maybe it was the situation I was experiencing but this album has left a most wonderful impression in my mind. Every song has meaning and touches you in a way you won't forget. I have bought and listened to other albums by Mark Curry but nothing compares to this one. Enjoy!
2,meh...,meh. the 20 year old me was much more impressed with his songwriting than the 37 year old me is. good job by the seller though. arrived quickly and scratch free.
2,the sheep are not safe at the winery,"mark curry is a social misfit with a bad eye twitch. Where is Mark curry? Last I saw him, we were locked in the trunk of a car trying to get to the winery for a refund on inflated livers. Martha's Vineyard dreamers drink away their dreams."
5,my favorite cd of all time,"i have gone through 4 of this cd wearing them out since 1992. other than track 2, the entire cd is an amazing rollercoaster. pop this in your player, poor yourself a drink, and dive into the world of mark curry!"
1,Burg. eel skin,"I recieved the burg. eel skin cig. case- very nice to the eye- but the first day I rused it, the front pouch already ripped- looks nice and classy- but is cheaply made.New Ladies EELskin Cigarette Case Lighter Holder Wallet #MWE342"
4,Murder on a house tour,"I like all of Catherine Aird books, and this is a classic. When a young boy finds a body hidden in a suit of armour while on a house tour in Aird's fictional English county, suspician falls on the family of the Duke of Orman. Was it the Duke or his son? The Ditzy Duchess? The ne'er-do-well nephew? Inspector Sloane, stuck as always with Defective Crosby, is out of place in the Stately house, but, as the Chief Superintendant said, You can expect the tradional at the Duke's Estate."
3,Sloan takes on Nobles in this Aird winner..,"After a hyperactive child wanders where he shouldn't in an old castle and finds a body in a suit of armor, the Calleshire C.I.D is called in, and Inspector Sloan begins to piece together what happened to the poor librarian who was stuffed in the armor. Meanwhile, Aird shows us her humour as Sloan and Crosby interview the Earl of Ornum and his eccentric family. Soon, Sloan and Crosby discover that murder's afoot as another body is discovered. Aird certainly knows about medievil weapons as Crosby gets in a few good cracks. Good, enjoyable mystery."
3,Beware!,"I read this book long ago, and a have a fond memory of it, and its Inspector C.D. Sloan, but that's not why I'm writing.PLEASE NOTE: If you don't want to know the solution to this mystery, don't read the review entitled ""Two Murders, One Book."" The solution is revealed in the review.Catherine Aird is a very delightful and witty writer; she and her readers (whatever they end up thinking of the book) deserve to be allowed to enjoy the process of discovering whodunnit together, without having their sport spoiled."
3,This one's for Disney,"I was not expecting a fantasy. This is a delightful on, and done with such sincerity, it is difficult not to get channeled in. If you love the sea, Scandinavian lore, and a long and interesting yarn that will stimulate your imagination, this is perfect. It creates a place and a trip to long for, it almost seems possible, but...."
2,its ok.,The movie as stated in the first review here is correct on every thing but i would give a extra half star. Since i cant it gets a 2 star. The movie does have action but is more geared on telling its story. The problem is at times the story is rushed and half way though the shooting style trys to be grimy after the 2 guys head of to the crime route. So the film is mixed and doesn't know what it wants to be.I say rent if you can find it for rent or buy used...You might be able to rent from amazon and stream to your computer
4,photographs with no commentary - primarily Mexican,"This book contains photographs without commentary - it is not a study of Mexican Baroque/folk style but rather an opportunity to experience something of the Mexican style without traveling.The churchs are all Mexican with the exception of one in Antigua Guatemala. The northernmost is in Zacateca, the southernmost in Mexico is in Tlacholula - some 20+ locations in all.Many of the black and white photos lack sufficient differentiation in the book so that some sections of the photo lacks detail. The composition of the photographs is excellent.Photos of particular interest to me: The Church of Santa Maria in Jolalpan with its very brightly painted exterior, the Day of the Dead colorful skeletons, the very ornate Chapel of the Rosary in Puebla, the vine/saint motif in the Church of Santa Domingo in Oaxaca.If you are interested in folk religion or religious architecture, this volume is recommended."
3,"Charming, but disappointing","This book has great subject matter, the photographer has a super eye for detail and the broader architecture of excessive Mexican churches. But ultimately, the book is insubstantial, and the monochrome printing does no justice to the material."
3,"BROADWAY WITHOUT THE shOW, pEO-PLE","this is good, but she needs a show of her own on stage to shine. See her in concert and see Chenoworthin ANYTHING and Ringwald in sweet Charity for GOOD b-way, people!"
5,Peaceful and Pleasing Music,Kimo brings a bit of Hawaii to all of us.His artistic and technical abilities on the Guitar are awe-inspiring.You can really tell his love for ki ho'alu.Mahalo to Kimo for what he has done here!
5,Beautiful and Relaxing,"I absolutely love this CD. Actually, I love all of Jim's CDs.His music takes you right to the beaches of Hawaii. I listen to this CD after a rough day, or while I'm doing homework for college."
5,excellent -transports you to the islands,Living in a big noisy city this CD keeps me mellow. Jim finds a way with his music to make you feel like your in the islands. Each melody has a story of it's own and Jim plays so you feel it. Please keep playing!
2,organization good - BUT WAY TOO HEAVY TO CARRY,"I like the organization of the calendar (and Amazon, show more interior pictures, please).I liked the colors...but the beast seemed to be about 3 lbs in weight...way to heavy to add to laptop, blackberry, etc.They should use lighter paper, take out the phone book section (who uses that in the 21st century anyway.)I sent it back.... too much stress on overworked shoulders already"
3,Excellent information; highly annoying presentation,"Having seen the content of several other Florence/Tuscany DVDs (many of which clock in at 20 minutes or so total), I'd give this 5/5 for content. Attractions in Florence, Carrara, Vinci, San Gimignano, Siena, Maremma, Elba, and Pisa are presented along with travel tips (mostly where to stay and how to get around, with almost no attention paid to where to eat). Unfortunately, the narrator, Ian Wright, is so annoying I had to knock it down by 2 stars. He's like Jamie Oliver meets Carrot Top."
1,Forget this one!,"We just finished watching ""The Ian Wright Attempted Comedy Hour"". What a disappointment! We have watched this young man in the past, and found him an okay host. This DVD is terrible. Ian seems to relish visiting Florence looking like a cross between a hood, and a rag picker. His behavior is terrible. He is insulting, and crude, but seems to think this is quite amusing. He is an example of what no country would wish for as a traveling representative."
5,I Want To Live Here!!!,"I want to live on Hurago! Talk about tropical paradise. True love, evil handled appropriately. I loved how the author made the island a character all by itself. It's a paranormal -- definitely. Suspense too. And let's not forget the romance. Major kudos here!"
4,Works great with my Slimline computer,I purchased this for my Gateway SX2800-03 (which is a slimline machine) and the optional bracket fit perfectly. The port works and is compatible with Windows Vista 64bit home premium.This is a great option for anyone trying to upgrade in a tight case.
2,Had to ship back,I received a different one than the one I ordered. Ordered the red one and got the green one. Checked some reviews on it and decided to return without using it.
1,"Crash, Crash, Crash!","I never could get this to work in a brand new HP Pavilion with Windows 7. Maybe it was compatible with computers from a year or so ago, but it certainly doesn't appear to work with the latest technology. I had nothing but crashes during each attempt to capture video. I'm going back to the old computer with the old firewire card until I can find something that works with PCIe."
5,Awesome !,I use the tascam fw 1884 daw for music upgraded to win 7 was having driver problems with my old pci card . This card with the Texas instruments chip solved my problem . Have not had a drop out yet ! Musicians will love this card I do
2,Wrong Power Supply Connector - MOLEX and no Adapter,"Although the for this item has been upgraded to PCIe, they still retained a legacy power supply connection. A legacy (white nylon Molex) power supply splitter was supplied that is essentially useless on many newer PC that have moved on to SATA and the newer black plastic lower profile power connections. Since the external power supply connection is REQUIRED on this card, they should have included a $.25 adapter to permit the card to be attached to a newer style power supplies. Now I've got to spend my time and my effort to track down a special purpose widget that SHOULD have been included in the FIRST place. The shipping/gas to procure the adapter is going to be more that the cost of the adapter. Dumb move SIIG - really dumb."
5,Works fine right out of the box,"This product worked as advertised right out of the box, never minding that the instructions seem to insist on a separate power hook-up."
2,"Interesting, but I preferred the book!","My review mirrors the experience of another commentator, Lisa Flaherty, (Review January 12, 2000). Like her I had moved from Alexander, to Shackelton, to Lansing,and recently attended a wonderful exhibition of the Endurance expedition at the Field Museum here in Chicago. It was there that I first became aware of the 35mm footage and the fact that color slides were also taken by Hurley. I bought this video at Museum's store and was disappointed. The 35 mm film ends abruptly after the demise of the Endurance and there is a good deal of ""filler"" which has been described by several other reviewers as reminiscent of early National Geographic footage.I do love historical film and it was interesting to see members of the Endurance struggling to free the ship, evacuate the dogs, and the like. But, for me, the still photographs carry the greatest weight and I could have done without this purchase."
2,SOUTH,"I was disappointed in this video. I expected the original film footage of the expedition, but the ""tinny"" piano in the background and the subtitles were distracting. I think I would have enjoyed this video much more had it been narrated. That the film survived the expedition and the rescue is remarkable. A better showcase for this extradorinary film would be beneficial."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:South's authentic footage of Shackleton's Transantartic expedition will appeal to enthusiasts of polar exploration, but it's not a very accomplished documentary and the last 20 minutes of nature footage are really pretty boring: you should only see this if you've already seen the documentary ""The Endurance"" or read the book and want more."
2,So what WAS the title Paulette Struckman was seeking?,"In her own review of ""South,"" Paulette Struckman mentions another Shackleton movie using original footage but narrated. I believe that's the film I've been seeking. Did she ever find it? Does anyone else know that title? It's not ""South,"" and it must have been released in the early 1990s. Please help. Thanks!"
2,Missed the most important part of the story,"The film was weak on the journey Shackleton took to get the men rescued. Too much side info, animals ect, and too little about the ""Man"""
3,It is ok but it makes you lost sometimes......,"It is a fairly good book however in some parts i got lost in.Especially chapter 3, for example page 43... ""create another C++ source code file and call it test_drawing_functions.cpp. Type in the source code that I porvided above for main(). What main()code? There is no code right above with that code and not even in the previous page... This made the entire chapter a blure to me and i still did not get a single code right in that chapter. This author really wants you to remeber everything in the first 2 chapters (i.e - The beginning part of each source code and definitions.)"
4,Great Introduction,This book offers a great introduction to various kinds of computer programming. It is very easy to understand and the CD that comes with it provides hours of entertainment. It has helped me understand the software I own better and appreciate the hardwork that goes into programming. I am even considering taking courses in programming!
3,"Good book, hard to use software, absolutely inappropriate language for beginners","Book - 5 stars.Software (Quincy IDE + graphics programming library) - 1 star.Although book itself is very good, I would never ever use C++ to teach computer programming to beginners (language is too complicated, it is really hard to figure out what is wrong once you made a mistake etc.)They would be much better off using Python, Java or practically any other language (especially one with decent free IDE)."
1,Caution-Small Magnets May Fall Out,"Please BE WARNED: There is not a recall on this product, BUT the very small magnets on the feet can fall out!!!!"
4,A charming story that needs a few more pages to finish.,"I plan on reading this book to my 6th-grade students as a read aloud. I enjoyed the simple sentence structure and the lack of tedious detail that sometimes finds its way into similar books. I did, perhaps, want for a bit more detail at the end of the book. It tends to leave the reader wanting for a more emotional twist or more pathos to carry the reader into the Christmas season with a more enlightened heart. The book is entertaining and full of the voice that has enchanted an entire generation of young and old(er) readers."
4,A helpful book!,"I while ago, I bought this book, along with a copy of Marvel vs. Capcom 2. If you are interested in buying this book, then please read on.This book helped me A LOT with the game. Basically, one can say it is a beefed up version of the instruction manual, but I beg to differ. It has every single character descriptions, move lists, and tips. It is especially helpful with secret characters, since you would have to learn their moves on your own. On the downside, I noticed that it had some mistakes. Nothing really major, but just some mistakes in the move names. Also, the way the book is made is pretty cheap. After a month or so, it starts falling apart.Overall, if you're completely new to Marvel vs. Capcom 2, look no further. Otherwise, you might want to check elsewhere."
2,Basically a large Manual that already comes w the game,"The sellers who think someone is stupid enough to pay 50 for this used should be commited to an asylum.The guide is nothing more than a book on moves, and little about strategy. The reviewers who say otherwise are hoping they can convince you to pay them a lot of your hard earned cash for their guide.If you have any experience with fighting games, you don;t need this. If you are a newbie, read the manual that comes with the game, or use the 50 bucks you are thinking about spending on this guide to buy an older capcom fighting game to learn the moves on.Very little about strategy at all. It tells you to try and link super moves into a combo. Anyone can do this on their own with a little practice. the guide is nothing in depth at all."
2,It is not worth a cent for the whole thing!,I agree with the dude from Texas who said not to waste you're money and gave it a rating of one star. I am only giving it a two star rating because they actually gave the effort for making this book.
5,An Amazing Album from the Greatest Living Jazz Pianist,"Mike ""Jonesy"" Jones, the multi-tattooed jazz demon from Las Vegas, hits us with eleven tracks of the most astonishing piano-work you'll ever experience. This album was recorded shortly after Jonesy moved to Sin City from his native Buffalo and became a desert dweller - it has all of the awesome skill of his previous records but feels a little freer, more exuberant.Still not sure? Download ""On The Sunny Side of the Street"", go on - risk a dollar. I no longer have to convince you to buy the rest of the album, that one track will do all of the work for me.Enjoy!"
2,"Not what it's ""crack'd up"" to be (great food)","This album really *tried* to push the bound-aries of post-rock, experimentalism, but I really put the *'s areound ""Tried"" for it's ""*great food*""Look, Mr Muggy is a band with an average amount of potential but a Boat Load of spirit, which leads to memorable, yet discountable tracks like ""Another Muggy Day."" Although henceforth yet hitherto, they have embodied the persona of MAD_B's Lesbiana before MAD_B even existed. I call it the Creme de La Creme (if you you know what I mean)The angular guitars and fuzzy vocals remind me of kareoke - but good kareoke. The problem with good kareoke is that it's terrible compared to normal music.2 stars"
1,cute but too generic would be better w/out background vocals,"I got this from my fiance' about a year and a half ago which he got from someone and he never listened to it, he was going to throw it away, but gave it to me instead, and it the record company was a no name record company, which are my favorites usually, but this time I was dissapointed. As much as I love girl singers even in the background, the backup girl sounded more like she was at a karaoke party. She has a cute voice in her own way, but by no means should she have any business in the recording studio."
3,Their Best Album!,"I couldn't disagree more. This is not a bad album, probably their best one, a lot better than ""Alan, Elvis & God"", with great power pop tunes like ""It's Strange Believe Me"", ""daisyhead"", and ""Uncut"" this cd rocks from start to finish. I saw this band live in 1995, opening for Warren Zevon, in Portland, OR. They were great!Cheers,Mike A."
2,Item received was not in the condition as indicated,"Items Ordered Price1 of: Hey Mom, Can I Ride My Bike Across America?: Five Kids Meet Their Country [Hardcover]By: John Seigel BoettnerCondition: NewSold by: Kokou's books (seller profile)Actual book was used and lacked dust cover."
2,No,Do you want to watch a man talk about how great his neighborhood is and demonize suburbs for 49 minutes? If so you should watch this but be wary of the few minutes where an expert interviewed and has something worthwhile to say.
5,Versatility,"Buying this piece of glass was the right thing to do. I have taped outside social events in wide angle and it has performed very well. Plus, the extra wide angle exposure is great for scenic shots. There are no ""fuzzy"" issues at the edges and you get used to the extra weight. All in all, a very fine investment that adds much needed versatility to the camcorder.Canon WD-H43 0.7x Wide Angle Converter for HV20 & HV30 Camcorders"
3,Huge!,"Like everyone else has said this wide angle lens is huge and heavy, but a quality lens always is. Before I had this I always had to stand back from everyone because the HV30 doen't have a very wide angle lens built in. I am an amuture camera man and mostly film my little boy. When he started walking I could only get the upper half of his body and not his feet. Most of the video I am walking backwards just trying to keep him in frame. I like the fact that I can get up closer now and not cut his feet off. I almost retured it though becasue it is pretty heavy. I don't know if it was worth the $150 and extra camera weight, but i'm stuck with it now and at least I have a wider angle."
5,Quality built Wide angle len,Very nicely built wide angle len. Fit perfectly onto my HG10 camera. Now I can shooting video at close range and able to capture wide angle. Very nice indeed. Yes it kinda heavy if you shoot video only using one hand to shoot. But I also use my left hand to help support the camara bottom when I am shooting video. So it is not an issue for me as far as heavy go.
4,the huns of august,"Barbara Tuchman writes a compelling narrative, but her biases are not controlled. One of these is against the Germans. Because they were so pig-headed and incompetent, she must struggle to explain their initial success. This book is a useful corrective to those biases. the Germans were not Nazis. Their expectation of British indifference to Belgium was based upon earlier precedent.B identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the four characters around whom he builds the story. For many his most important observations are those about the deficiencies of the Royal Navy, behind in the science of organization and some technology.B. can show how Petain was in many ways right person for 1917 but quite flawed.not for those who like their history in black and white."
1,Not up to standard anymore!,"This book is simply a reissue of the 1963 edition, and it's really a pity that the publisher has decided to re-print such a flawed and bias account of the main antagonists in WWI.There is no clear line of argument and attempt to characterise each general. To me it seemed that the author was jumping around all over the place. Particular annoying are the references to WWII, which don't really underline any of the arguments brought forward.The sketchy characterisation of the ""swordbearers"" does not warrant the title of the book, since for lengthy passages the book dwells on the larger events and then halfheartedly tries to return to its intended objective."
4,Great pan but small.,Absolutely love this pan. Ridiculously expensive but we LOVE it. Only down side was it was smaller than expected. Can't make multiple pancakes unless dollar size. Great for eggs though and super easy to clean. Love this brand and plan to buy more when we strike it rich!
1,Fraudulent claims. Contains same chemical as Teflon.,"Swiss Diamond non-stick cookware is made with same chemical, PTFE, as Teflon. Also, it is not durable. The non-stick surface scratches easily with a common fork. You can research this from any major search engine, look for ""Swiss Diamond teflon"" (but without the quotes in your query.) They claim that they use a nano-composite of real diamond crystals and PTFE. You can also search for ""PTFE"" for more info. Scratching the surface with a household fork causes microscopic bits of the composite material (PTFE and diamonds) to be released into the food being cooked, whereby they are swallowed by consumers."
3,Chet Baker - When Sunny gets Blue,"I bought this CD sight unheard, because I love Chet Baker and love that particular song. I think this may have been the last recording CB made, and he probably shouldn't have. It sounds like his brain was pretty well fried by then. The sidemen are all excellent, and Chet's playing is still good in spots. There is one vocal, and he definitely shouldn't have tried to sing at this point. It was sad to hear what had happened to such a superb talent toward the end of ""the longest suicide in the world."""
1,Worst Chet ever....,"This could possibly be the worst Chet Baker album I've ever heard. I am a HUGE Chet fan, and the fact that Steeplechase released this album is a travesty. I am surprised that someone actually gave this record 5 stars. He solos are extremely erratic, and he doesn't make a coherent statement anywhere on this recording. There are much better recordings from later in his career(Check out Live in Bologna, or Chet's Choice on Criss Cross records.) Please, skip this one. You'll be glad you did."
3,Very good book.,"If you're looking for a truly great book on what you need to know on a trading floor than you need to look for this author's book called simply ""The Bond MarketThe Bond Market: Trading and Risk Management"""
4,"Just as awesome, but less savory scent...","This is fine shaving creme, and I had to try it based on an ongoing Wodehouse obsession, but other scents are better than Eton College. Sandalwood is the cheapest (usually) and best smelling (to me). Get this for fun, but for your first creme get TOBS Sandalwood."
4,Smells yummy!,"This smells so much better than the Sandalwood version. I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and both he and I enjoy the scent. The soap also lathers up nicely. I would recommend this product."
2,"""smells like cheap Avon"" per my wife...","I have and use Talyor of Old Bond Street ""sandalwood"" and really like it so I thought I would expand the experience of a good wet shave by trying other scents. I opened this and didn't really care for the smell. To perfumey is what I thought, so I had my wife take a whiff and that is where ""smells like cheap Avon...yuck"" came from. Sorry, I'll have to pass on this one. I can't speak of the lather as I don't want to smell on my face, but would assume the same good quality lather and shave."
1,Dissapointed,This is the second time i ordered this product and received a different product in it's place. I will never ofer a product from this provider again.
2,Steppenwolf,"Looking for a great comprehensive history of Steppenwolf? Looking for tons of great footage from the 60's & 70's, interviews with all the original band members, great stories about being on the road, hanging with the other rock stars of that era?Well keep looking. This is about 95% John Kay talking and not much else. NO concerts from those days and only a few minutes of archival footage are included. If you are into his current band, songs, and concerts then you might find this interesting otherwise save your cash."
1,Disappointing to say the least,History of lead singer John Kay's life -- which is okay but not what a fan would hope to see in a DVD format that you would hope would finally be a definitive review/history of the BAND.
3,could have been better,"As much as i enjoyed the dvd and the interviews with Johnand the ex members, what this dvd is lacking is archivalfootage. There is plenty of it on you tube, so why not on here?It gets irritating as John narrates about the early days,then it cuts in and out thru out the narration with the 2003 version of steppenwolfplaying the songs. There is an excellent clip of vintagesteppenwolf from 1968 with the great rushton moreve on bassfrom playboy after dark making the rounds. That could have been on the dvd.They were on tv quite a few times in the 60's and early 70's.The new steppenwolf could have been placed at the end of the storyor as a bonus feature."
3,Let the customer know what is damaged,When I buy a used item I want to know the truth about the condition of the item. The first cassette was visually damaged; totally not usable in it's case. The next eleven have so far been usable. If I had not known how to splice the tape and totally rewind it onto new reels I would have returned the tapes. I salvaged the tape only because I knew how to repair and rewind onto another tape. This seller need to be honest with people.
5,moe bandy,"I HAVE BEEN AFTER THIS ITEM FOR AGES .THIS IS MOE AT HIS BEST ,WELL WORTH THE WAIT.JUST WISH I HAD ACCESS TO MORE OF HIS ALBUMS"
5,It's pretty obvious what Union shills are rating this a zero,"Consider these facts:10% of Private sector employees are Union40% of Public sector employees are Union50% of Union membership nationwide are public sector employees$800,000,000 in Union political expenditures yearly go exclusively to the (D)'sUnion dues for public employees now go directly to the Unions via tax deductable, therefore tax payer subsidized, deductions the members never see.These Unions, now dominated by public sector employees, have a vested interest in bigger government and higher taxes. In other words... Socialism.Read all about it:"
2,Very Redundant,"This sounds like one woman with a very large grudge. Yes, labour owns the Democrats and big biz owns the Republicans. No surprise there. How many different, (and same) ways can you say the same thing?"
1,Election Year Drivel,"This right-wing swipe at ""the left"" is so transparent. She's angry at the big bad union bosses and the way they do business. Aren't we all!Chavez is obviously cheerleading for the Republicans in this election year tome. Her ""contribution"" is to remind us of the worst elements of labor unions and how they ultimately support the Democrats.With all her demagoguery, thank God she never became the Secretary of Labor."
1,Election Year Drivel,"If you feel you must read this, wait until it hits the discount stand when you should be able to buy it for $1.98."
1,More lies from the far right,"Just as the far right radical Bush administration lies about WMD, the war in Iraq and 9/11, comes Bush administration cast-offs lying about the only protections working Americans have against the Enrons of the world. Chavez in a recent interview shilling this book couldn't even say what the current minimum wage is. That's the kind of liar that writes a book like this. No need to believe anything in this long, deceptive and extremely boring book. Dishonesty is again the hallmark of the radical right."
4,"Great Product, Good Price","I was surprised by the amount of tea that I received for the price. Plus the variety is great. My husband found the tea to be less tasty than I, but he is normally a coffee drinker and I am a dye hard tea drinker. He did state that the calming tea did help him sleep better. I have been drinking it on the way to work in the morning to help start the day in a stressful work environment calmly. It really seems to help. I am even considering having a mid-day tea, to ease the stress for the remainder of my day."
2,Expected more from Yogi,"Love many of the Yogi teas, but was really disappointed in the taste of most of these. The Chamomile is good. The Kava Stress Relief and the Calming were the worst for me...bleck, couldn't even finish the cup when I made those. And 6 boxes..sheesh, what was I thinking not buying a box locally first to try? Oh well, there are plenty of other Yogi teas to enjoy :)"
2,not worth the money,Kinda funny and there were some neat clips but not worth $15 for such a short thing.
3,Mixed feelings,"Interesting trip back through time, but rather over-priced for such a short dvd. Still, it is worthwhile for fans of old-style American cabaret dance who are not on a budget."
5,"bought 6 pack from homedepot, instant on","These bulbs are great, they really are instant on unlike some cfl's that I have bought. I do need more than 60watt equivalent in some rooms though. These actually are brighter than a 60W incandescant bulb and the color is pretty warm.."
4,Interesting person and scholarly presentation.,"This book deals with a remarkable woman who had a remarkable life, and it is definitely a serious, scholarly presentation. If you are interested in thoughtful, sociological and psychological theories of biography and interested in the remarkable things that happened to people in the early days of this country, this is a fine, well-researched book."
3,NOT VERY GOOD,"I thought this would be a good made-for-TV type movie but I was really disappointed. I kept thinking the director was holding back the actors, not giving them a chance to really get into their characters. In the end, I'll keep it in my DVD library but doubt I'll watch it very often."
5,Very funny.,"If you liked the movie Christmas Vacation, but didn't care for the bad language & sexual overtones, you will appreciate this movie. Good, clean humor showing that money isn't everything. Great for the whole family."
2,Holiday Movies,"No, I didn't care for this movie. I usually like all Christmas movies but didn't like this one at all."
3,Hectic movie,"the family holiday was a silly, shallow, simile of a make believe family who in the end becomes a real family, I think...though marriage was never mentioned, and I believe all families should start with marriage..."
4,Cute Christmas movie,"This is a fun, wholesome movie, shot in Spokane, WA, that incorporates the best of two homeless kids, a very cute dog, conniving adults who are all looking for the same thing - family. There is sometimes corny but cute dialogue - and of course, a happy ending."
4,Christmas movies,"I enjoy watching Christmas movies before and during the holidays. I checked on Amazon.ca to see what was available, and chose this one because of the story line. I really enjoyed it, the story line wasgood and just a really good 'feel good' movie."
3,Slow to go,"The Family HolidayThis film is fairly good family entertainment. It is slow to get going, and does not have a great deal of content, but all in all a cute, clean, funny, heartwarming holiday fare."
4,A Pleasant Holiday Movie,"The Family Holiday was an amusing, lighthearted family movie. I thought the children did a decent job; William Schultz especially stood out. Kevin Connell made an excellent villain. As far as TV Movies go, it was a decent one."
4,A good and enlighting read.,"A wonderful account of a mans passion for life and his integrity that could not be compromised. As mentioned in other reviews, I did see the movie Braveheart and wished to make a comparision. I am please to say that although they were differences there were no discrepancies. This was a easy read and I recommend it for any history buff. I am in the process of reading another account of William Wallances life. I understand that there are a couple of books in publication with regard to The King's Enemy and I plan to read them all. My ancestors are from Scotland and my interest lies in absorbing as much about this country before I visit. Once again a good read!"
4,Nicely told,a nicely written synopsis that can be read on vacation and enjoyed for hitting the high points and amusingly trailing off into interesting theories and ideas.Brief in scope but informative enough to satisfy your curiosity about this fascinating subject.A very nice read.
3,A brief history of the Scotish rebel William Wallace.,"An easy read for someone who is interested in William Wallace (Braveheart) and the medieval history of Scotland. Book gets bogged down in the family trees of the Scotish nobles and their varying politics. Edward I depicted as a less than desireable ruler of England and Scotland. The description of the battles is of interest, and the reason why Wallace failed, where Robert the Bruce later had success."
4,To catch more trout you have to learn what they eat,"Trout eat things. Sometimes its nymphs, sometimes its Duns, sometimes its Terrestrails. This book discusses the insects that Trout eat and gives you clues on how to determine what they are eatting and how to match it when you hit the water. This fisherman introduction to bugs is scientific enough to get you started into further research if you would like and basic enough that you don't have to learn Latin names in order to understand what type of Caddis you are looking for. This book is also a good resource for learning how to tie flies that will match the hatches that you are experiencing. The only downfall in my opinion is that the pictures are not in color and therefore you don't get as exact of a photographic match of the insects as you would would color photography."
5,CD delivered,Chose 5 rating for delivered in good condition and no scratches. The music sounds good and these are songs I have not heard in a long time. Thanks Amazon.
5,If you have a breathing disorder,"I am a non-smoker with COPD and allergies. Due to my job, I have access to just about any medical reference I want. I wanted a guide for medications and conditions to help me be better informed about my problems. I found this guide to be very useful. Dr. Adams presents excellent information on both diseases and conditions as well as medications. This book is a couple of years old, but still as up to date with medications as possible, and still quite useful. I am hoping he will update this guide soon, and I would purchase it if he did. I also have his newer guide to asthma, and it is quite good as well. I would recommend this if you need a reference for lung problems."
4,The Marriage Bed,I disagree with the other reviews that say this book had no romance what is more romantic then two people finding there way back to each other.it shows us that the path to love can sometimes be painful but it you keep working at it that you can find a much strong love.I have read so many books where the man never acknowledges his faults and the books ends where the woman just forgives John saw that his actions had cause pain for his wife and that he could not go back and change what he did but try and be a better man to me thats what love does it makes you try and be a better person for the one you love.
1,I hate the hero too,"oh my gosh, I seriously hate the hero too. He's lame and a loser. He's not sorry for anything he's done to the heroine. Spoiler. He's just like oh I cheated, I'm not going to apologize for any of that because it's in the past and I can't change it (of course that would mean everything bad he did is fine in his mind because it's happened already and thus is in the past and unchangeable). He's actually like a real life cheating husband except worse because after he tries to tell her that all those other women didn't mean anything to him and that it was all just S-E-X he mentions that he only really cared about or had a deep relationship with one of the women he cheated on her with. I wish she could have gotten a divorce from him because I could see her a lot happier with some other guy than forever stuck raising her idiot husband and his mistress's son. The hero never see's things from her point of view. He's like a tiger woods except with a wife that can't legally leave him."
3,Disappointing...Really 2.5 stars,"I am a fan of Laura Lee Guhrke's books especially 'And He Kissed Her'. I really tried to get into this book, but I couldn't overcome my dislike of the hero's infidelity. The hero, Lord John Hammond, is portrayed as a slightly tortured soul; however, he never develops into a sympathetic enough character to justify 8 years of infidelity. 'My wife kicked me out of bed for a month so I took a mistress to satisfy my physical needs'. Give me a break."
3,Uninspiring but decent,This was fine. The writing was never atrocious. The dialogue tended to lack contractions which made it feel awkward sometimes. There was some heat in the romance but not much. The story and characters were interesting enough to keep me reading to the end although I kept waiting for the end to come and thought it went on about 50 pages too long.
2,"""Horrible Ending""",I lot of what I enjoy most about reading romance novels are the happy endings. I was so dissapointed in the story when the mistress shows up at the end. It really took away from the reconcilation that was happening between John and Viola. I think it would have been a better story if the mistress faded out of the story with no attachments. There was a lot of forgiveness envolved in the story....but enough is enough. I don't read romance for that kind of drama. That was a bit upsetting for me. This book is not a keeper. I gave it a two because the ending destroyed any likes of the entire story.
4,The first half of the book needs work...,"The plot of this book really interested me and I was looking forward to reading this. I think that LLG did a great job with the Hero, I saw definite character growth. Even though he was a ""cheater"", he didn't think that he was a bad person, he was just incredibly self-absorbed.I think she could have used the first half of the book for more ""realizations"" rather than wasting it with the fighting and temper tantrums (especially the heroine) that weren't sexy, funny or even interesting. I think the heroine did some growing up throughout the book but I felt like LLG flipped a switch and the heroine went from hating the hero to loving him again.The last third of the book redeemed itself and overall I liked the concept, but I think it had more potential. If you can get through the first half, it's worth it."
2,Can't. Take. The. Adultery.,"It was really hard to read this book because of the husband. He doesn't deserve her, he REALLY doesn't deserve her, and she, despite whatever he calls her - unforgiving ice queen and what else - has the most unbelievable patience and kindness and forgiveness on the planet. It was sickening. And that is not to say that love isn't about forgiveness, but really, if I were her, I would have shot him and been rid of him... the epilogue nearly made me sick. I can't say the writing isn't good, because Guhrke isn't a bad writer, but there's just something so distasteful about the man that it is unreasonable to like him. The last line of the book is about how a man like him could be so lucky - and really, he doesn't deserve it at all. I was left with a very bitter taste in my mouth that the epilogue just cinched, so read this at your own peril - I didn't have a taste for tolerating adultery before and definitely don't have it now."
2,Cheaters - not in romance,"I do like Gurhke. Having said that this book was one of her worsts for me. The writing style was great but I hate and let me say again hate cheaters. If I pick up a romance book I want it to be about the H/H and not those people commiting adultry. Whats so romantic about that. And John was going to ""woo"" his wife to get back in her good graces when did that ever happen. I just can't say anything that I did like about the book. But if you like Heros that cheat then this may be the book for you."
1,Zero Stars!,"I bought this book because I usually love Guhrke's writing. Unfortunately, this book left me ANGRY!As a woman who has dealt with infidelity in my own marriage,reading about it in such blatant and UNROMANTIC terms was horrible. When Viola spilled her heart and feelings out to her douchebag husband I literally sobbed and wept because I knew exactly how she felt. I knew what it felt like to be betrayed.I read romance novels to get away from the real life crap, I don't want to read about my own life in a romance novel.John was mean, uncaring, unloving, unrepentant, and despicable. Sure, he was charming, but that is NEVER enough to cover the multitude of sins he commited against his wife.Do not read this book. The romance is slim, the ""hero"" is unlikeable, and the end just doesn't do the heroine justice. She deserves better than what she got."
3,Take a chance,"I rated this book a 3 star because I'm not sorry I read it. It may not be the best historical romance I've ever read but it isn't the worst either. If you like reconciliation, forgiveness and sweet love, I think you'll like this story."
5,HMS & NASCAR are great examples,"""Together"" fits most organizations affiliated with NASCAR. I'm proud of them & proud to be a fan. Oh, ""Them"" being both HMS & NASCAR. Still would like to see #24's ""Drive for 5"" happen."
1,Never received,"I never received this dvd from the seller. I sent them an email asking for the tracking information, and still did not hear back from them. I guess I will take it up with Amazon now."
2,Very Disappointing,I am an Altonya Washington fan from the Ramseys series. I decided to read her previous books that I found on my mother's shelf. This book did not flow well. Usually I finish her books in a day or so. This one took me over a week to complete because it was dreadful for me to pick up where I left off. Thankfully her writing improved tremendously since her sophomore book.
4,LOVED IT,This was a great read keep me up way in the late hour. The story starts off jumping from the beginning. The charters and sub charters are great. I was feeling them. The love scenes BOY OH BOY is all I can say to that. This is my first book by Ms Washington bust best believe me I will go get her first book this weekend. The only reason I couldn't give this book a five the end of the book was the way the ending dragged out way to long for the ending. All in all a great read.
3,Left something to be desired,"While the SEX scenes (not love scenes, she didn't know him) were hot, the rest of the book was mediocre. The first half of the book read like a football roster. The author used titles so much(Chief Captain Maurice, Captain so and so, Co-Captain xyz, Team Captain abc, sub captain, apprentice....)that it broke the flow of the storyline. Darius, the lead male character was a successful business man whose pants were constantly ""sagging"". He had sooo many insecurities that he continuously pushed Selena away and she she'd bounce right back either begging him to keep her or accepting a lame excuse for his behavior."
5,Sweet Stevie,While you may want to pick and choose his 70s and later stuff on iTunes. This CD is the perfect early Stevie Wonder collection. Not a bad track here. Give it a listen and you'll know why he was given his stage name.
1,Not satisfied,"The product i received was not exacly as pictured. yea, it will work ""I think"" but it should be slanted as pictued, to allow antenna to stand streight up. This one is going to stick out to the left."
5,I'd buy another one......,I purchased the credit card holder for my husband and he is very pleased with it. It's the right size for his pocket and the right price for mine.
1,Fan's view,"Very disappointed in this product. It is leather however, the plastic holders in the wallet began to come apart immediately. I guess it is true . ""You get what you pay for."" It was relatively inexpensive. I should have known not to buy it."
5,"Snap, leather add to longevity","The credit card holder is accurately described as high quality. These are not sold locally, but you won't find a better value at a local store. Usually these credit card holders last a short time for me in my back pocket. Leather outlasts plastic, but I particularly like the snap that keeps the wallet closed and probably ends the problem of individual vinyl credit card pockets getting chewed up in my back pocket. This is a very good product, and the seller has dealt with me fairly. I recommend both."
5,"Pretty functional, good deal for money.","The leather is not premium (and should not be for this price), but the wallet does hold great number of cards in pretty compact size package. If you are like me - have to carry tons of cards and hate thickness of other wallets, and also like to see all cards without pulling them out then this is the way to go. The only drawback - business cards do not fit plastic inserts, so the only place you can have them is in the leather pocket on inside part of the cover. If you have to carry a lot of business cards that wont work for you. But for me it's not big deal as long as I can have 3 of them and they are not getting dirty. Overall I'm satisfied and definitely recommend this product."
4,Great but one drawback . . .,"Great credit card holder - good quality and put together well EXCEPT for one drawback that prevented a five-star rating from me. The plastic card holders are permanently fixed to the case, not inserted with an extra flap, as with other card wallets. It is neither removable for ease of use nor for later replacement, when edges begin to tear. It would have been appropriate for this info to be included in the product description. I had ordered two inserts with half the capacity to replace the bulkier one in this wallet; no can do."
5,Probably the best $23.95 I ever spent!!!,This book lives up to the promise made on the cover. The authors DO lead you every step of the way with practical tips and advice. I liked the checkpoints at the end of every chapter. The 23 things to ask for to get a better severance package is well worth the price of the book. Easy to read in very straight forward language... I really recommend this boo
4,accommodation,"I'm a great admirer of Munitz. It seems to me he is hitting on the same theme over and over, yet when I contemplate his ""boundless existence"" I am enthralled. As to the question in the title, he has re-defined the word ""meaning"" so as to develop a ""yes"" answer to the question, and I was let down."
2,THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUEST FOR MEANING,"Milton MunitzDoes Life Have a Meaning?(Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books, 1993) 114 pages(ISBN: 0-87975-860-0; hardcover)(Library of Congress call number: B821.M79 1993)A retired professor of philosophy explores the ins and outsof the philosophical quest for meanings in human life.He concludes that we can create many forms of meaning during our lives.He also attempts to explain a new concept: Boundless Existence.This seems to amount to a recognition that the universe exists.Such an awareness does not provide much additional meaningas far as this reviewer can see.You will find better book here on the Internet:""Meaning in Life Bibliography"".James Leonard Park, existential philosopher"
4,Great Book on Korean Buddhism,"The book provides a great glimpse into the life of Korean Buddhist nuns. Book is entertaining and insightful as you learn about Zen nunneries and Korean Buddhism through the eyes of a French woman. Book is even more interesting as you are also given the life story of an older nun, giving the reader a view of developments in Korean Buddhist nunneries throughout the 20th century."
1,Incomplete information,"This particular product description lacks necessary information for me to consider buying it... there are no dimensions, except width. Then Product Dimensions say ""16 pounds"", but Shipping Weight say 14 pounds. I am replacing an existing heater, so have an existing hole, so dimensions are very inportant."
1,Don't Even Think About Buying This...,"It may look cute but this is an awful product in both build quality and for fish keeping alike. It is simply way too small to keep even one fish in (well under a gallon), the ""office furniture"" takes up way too much room in this already tiny tank, and it has very sharp edges too - which are sure to injure your fish. It's impossible to clean, feels very cheaply made, and it just isn't good for any kind of fish. You're much better off getting a 10 gallon tank from your local fish store for not much more money and your fish will be much happier and live longer. An awful novelty product that should be avoided at all costs. For a better alternative I suggest any of Marineland's eclipse tanks. Marineland Eclipse System Three orMarineland Eclipse System Six Aquariumwould be great alternatives."
