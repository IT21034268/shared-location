5,Good for Violin Lover Starters,"I heard about BOND with my nephew and I fall in love with these group! They bond to my heart and my fascination of violin music. This is a new concept in violin performance. I recommend this DVD, because you can enjoy music and see the passion of the performance of these girls. I buy a new violin. My children see it and play with them the violin, dance and sing. I am going to buy other BOND presentation. It is a good choice.Vivian"
5,I love this concert...Bond rocks!!,"Ever since I started playing the violin, people were raving about this orchestra band called Bond. I borrowed my friend Paulina's DVD of the Royal Albert Hall concert and I loved every minute of it. I recommend this to the people who love violin and would enjoy watching the girls play electric orchestra instruments."
2,Expected more...,"not as good as Celtic Woman or Hanley Westenra ... I would say not half good. I can say they have great talent, but artistically ... wrong managed. Stopped watching after 30 min."
4,Bond ROCKS!,"What's not to love? Four beautiful women playing beautiful music! My only criticism is that it's way too short, but I'd imagine they'll be coming out with a new DVD soon, which I'd definitely buy!"
5,Bond performance,Good quality of music and great show. Lively modern mix of classical and rock music. If you like electrified classical music you will like this.
5,Melodramatic and Exciting music + Interesting Performance + Attractive Ladies + Beautiful picture = What else can you ask for?,"The music goes from melodramatic to exciting. The performance is interesting. The four lady musicians are attractive. The DVD is a beautiful picture. What else can you ask for?The only bad thing is most of the time the sound from the instruments of the 4 ladies is drowned out by background music.Still, they do make classical music sound exciting, and contemporary."
4,Bond,"Although I can't place my finger on it, I feel it lacked something for me to give it a five star rating. The concert was entertaining. The ladies are extremely sexy and talented. If you like this style of music or this group, I would still recommend it."
2,Skillful But Goofy,"The one time I attempted to watch this concert was immediately after watching ""Miracle"" by the 12 Girls Band (both concerts were on the same DVD for some odd reason). I was able to sit through only a few pieces before having to eject the DVD. While ""Miracle"" showed the 12 Girls Band to be a class act exhibiting skillful musicianship, elegance and femininity, Bond came across like some goofy teenage girls lacking class, elegance and femininity. OK, so they are skillful musicians; not good enough."
1,Unoriginal,"Listen once to ""The 1812"" and you will understand my one-star rating. The 1812 Overture is, admittedly, a little cheesy, but nothing deserves the treatment Bond give it.Classical instruments do not need a dance beat and electrification to be cool. Listen to anything by the band Apocalyptica, or even Godspeed You ! Black Emperor (who use celli)--there is music out there that pushes the boundaries of traditional classical music, and does it well, without resorting to electronic beats and scantily clad women.If you must order this, order Apocalyptica's ""Cult"" with it, for purposes of comparison."
3,Imagine a live pre-recorded concert,"This DVD is not a LIVE concert! At least not 100%. Although the 4 gifted string performers are actually playing music in front of a live audience at the Royal Albert Hall, the music track is superimposed on top of the live performance, which makes the concert feel and sound more like a music video. There is only one song that is played 100% live, and for that experience alone, I still rated the DVD with 3 stars. It is enjoyable and entertaining to watch Bond anyhow. Just understand that it is not a full live concert experience for which you will be paying."
1,Buy a different coffee maker!,"I purchased the Bosch TKA 2801 about two months ago and it's been nothing but trouble. To begin with, it feels cheap, with plastic moving parts that feel like they're about to fall off at any moment, and often do. But worse, unless one is very careful with the unit, more coffee will end up on your kitchen counter than in the carafe when the coffee is brewed. It's no fun to clean that mess over and over. I called Bosch customer service and was treated very rudely, but after complaining I was referred to an outside service agent that has been quite pleasant to deal with so far. They've offered to pay for me to ship the unit to them and they're sending me a completely new unit. Hopefully the new one will function better, although I'm not holding my breath given the poor design overall."
3,Come Here,I am pretty sure that Kath Bloom's COME HERE was in the movie BEFORE SUNRISE. It is a haunting amazing song.If that is the song on this CD then that alone makes it worth it.waynehazle.com
2,You get what you pay for.,"The dimensions of the miter slot are not provided for this item. Probably because it is undersize. The dimension is 1/4"" deep x 3/4"" wide. This means that any standard miter gauge or sliding shaper jig, will ride high and rock side to side with no table support. The miter gauge supplied is all plastic and is a grand total of 3"" long.It is also difficult to adjust the extension table sections low enough so that they do not interfere with the sliding miter gauge or shaper jig.The only plus on this set-up is a large, easy to access on/off switch.I don't understand why anyone would manufacture an item with so many shortcomings, when it would be just as easy to make the thing right in the first place.The best use for this product would be to mount a non-functioning router, and give the set to a child to play 'Carpenter' with.PS: Shipping was very expensive, ie: 50% of the cost of the item."
2,indian-spiced braised lamb shanks?,"Kind of a lazy book; the title suggests a comprehensive reference, but what you get is a whatchagot stew of arbitary recipes & once-in-a-while Indian Pudding & Johnny Cakes.The number of Recipes-to-number-of-pages ratio is quite low, & plenty/most recipes not especially ""New England"" -- just because a salad calls for boston lettuce does not make it a regional specialty. Pimm's Cup? Asparagus salad with lemon vinaigrette? grilled chicken sandwiches with russian dressing? pear and candied ginger clafouti? tomato & goat cheese salad?There's one clam chowder recipe & it is an abomination. LIkewise her take on boiled dinner...a quarter cup of soy sauce? You have got to be kidding.Since when does Martha's Vineyard belong to Rhode Island?And is Connecticut actually part of New England? All of CT? Anything outside of an easy commute to NYC? More Yankees bumper stickers than Sox as a geographical demarkation?There are other New England cookbooks that are much, much better."
3,Ballet Music,"It was only recently that I came to know the music of the Russian composer Anton Stepanovivh Arensky (1861-1906). He was Rimsky-Korsakov's student at the St Petersburg Conservatory in 1879. After graduation in 1882, he began teaching music, with Rachmaninov and Scriabin among his students. He became a conductor, and was appointed Director of the Imperial Chapel in 1895.Arensky wrote Egyptian Nights in 1900 for a one-act ballet which was performed in 1908, choreographed by Fokin.It is loosely structured, with some 15 ""pieces"", many of which are ""dances"", some of which are supposedly based on authentic oriental melodies. Most curiously it includes a rather long waltz!! However, the music is pleasant, with some nice melodies but, though rather exotic, it is definitely not a ""Scheherazade""!!Unfortunately, the sound is not deep or rich but rather ""hollow"". I noticed this same problem with many CDs recorded in Russia, as this one was."
2,The history of Marketing and recent developments.,"Webster gives a lot of detail of the history of Marketing in this book. It includes all the recent develpments in Marketing and how it has affected the customer. For those interested in how Marketing focuses on the customer, this is a great way to understand the marketing of a particular product. That said, this fact packed book is about as dry as can be. If you read this book, you will see how the reader has to slog through this material. Lots of facts and theory, but little in the way of interesting the general public.One market for this book is to university students in Marketing. This book is a great summary of where Marketing will go in the future, and this could help the student. Few people would find this book interesting, other than sales people and Marketing."
1,A Bummer & An Insult to One's Intelligence,"I didn't like this book when I was a child. I don't like it as a an adult. It is a farce, plain and simple. The reviewers who panned it for its absurdity were right on target. This poorly written tale just constructs a nice little fantasy about a martyr instead of a real child and it sounds like ""Ozzie & Harriet Confront C.P."" Although the anecdotes about the aminmals were cute, the whole book is written in a condescending tone. The racist name that one rabbit was given was insulting. Read ""Karen"" and ""With Love from Karen"" instead as these books complement your intelligence instead of insulting it like ""Wren"" does. I didn't like this book at all. I agree -- ""Wren"" really is for the birds."
3,Water Shoes,"They are okay for just going into the water, they do loosen up quite a bit. No padding on bottom, so not very good for water exercise classes."
2,Not for walking on rocks!,"These shoes seem to be constructed well and I like how they look, but there just is not enough cushion on the sole. Walking on rocks under the water (or on the way to the water) hurts almost as much as going barefoot. They're fine for walking on sand, but that's it!"
3,Speedo Women's Water Shoes,The shoes fit well but the sole is thin making it hard to walk over stones or climbing up onto shore. I purchased them to protect my feet while tubing down a river. They would be better used on a beach or boating.
5,My search for the perfect athletic underwear is over,"I spent a lot of time trying to find supportive athletic underwear that doesn't bunch up or get sweaty. These are the ones! I use them for Crossfit, running, hiking, etc. They're pretty snug, but keep everything under control and cool. However, I would not want to use these as every-day underwear; they are much too tight for that. The longest I've worn them is about 4 hours on a hike.I'm not certain but it appears these are no longer made by Under Armour, at least under the same name. Luckily I purchased 10 pairs--I've had these for about 9 months and they are holding up perfectly when washed (cold water) and air dried. I'm a size 29 waist, 5'10"", 145 lbs, and the smalls are perfect. Absolutely zero leg ride-up even when squatting, running, etc."
5,Awesome,I got these shorts in order to get gear for my first mud run. These are awesome. They kept the mud and sweat out of all the right places. I would def recommend.
4,Genuine as per picture shown,"Good buy and the colour is what I really want. Can't be any better. The compression, stretchability and feel is fantastic. Pricing is also reasonable."
5,Awesome shorts for long hikes and bicycling,"I use this compression short regularly for longer hikes and bicycle rides. Won't go back to using cotton undergarments for sports - No Chaffing, mostly dry even after long hikes/rides, dries overnight."
5,My guy loves these,"I purchased these for the man in my life. Compared to other similar items, these rate the best quality and just overall fit/likeablility. They are holding up well with frequent use and frequent washing. I would recommend these to anyone!"
5,Love it!,"Bought two of these compression shorts, it is a great buy! It may cost a bit, but it is worth the price cause it will get the job done no matter what!"
4,Swamp walking,This is a great undergarment to keep my fat thighs rubbing together on long walks. I found these more comfy if I wore them without underwear.
5,again,its under armour you can not go wrong if you do not own a pair then you need to trust me get some
4,Awesome!,"Be sure that you check on Under Armour's website to find sizing. I'm about a size 30 waist and thought I needed a small, turns out that I actually needed a medium size. They feel so cool and they're so flexible. Sometimes I just want to wear them as regular underwear! Great quality product, way to go Under Armour :)"
3,"Great Product, but Over priced on Amazon","These are great for hiking or anything else active. But do not buy them here, even if you don't pay for shipping they are overpriced here, you can find these $20 or less at a local sporting goods store. Other then that they are a very good product. But only 3 stars because well price matters and I look to amazon for deals or at least competitive pricing."
4,good,"if your going for more of just an under layer and not a layer of protection from sliding, id go with teh performance breifs."
5,Product fine but arried very late,"it arrived extremely late, to the point where i wondered if i had been robbed. Be prepared for an extra 2-3 weeks on the shipping estimate."
5,Review for Compression Shorts,These work so well. I got a black pair for Christmas and needed a pair of white ones for my white soccer shorts. They help so much in recovery and I couldn't recommend them more.
5,muy bueno el producto,"excelente el producto lo recomiendo, llego en buenas condiciones. el empaque es muy bueno, no estaba abierto y a tiempo!!"
5,Sleek & Comfortable Design,Would recommend over any other brand not because its Under Armour but the fact that it is really great and stays tight to hold everything in place during exercise when using the treadmill or doing some Insanity Workout DVDs. Great Product if your considering this its worth the extra buck because of how durable it is.
4,Good quality so far,"These are nice, although I wish they'd be a little longer and the waist not so high. When I go running I have to fold the waist down. They seem to bee good quality, although they are pretty expensive."
5,GRRREEEEAAATT,"love them, wwear them all the time, great for working out, if u have any doubts, dont hesitate, and buy"
2,"Extremely comfortable, but rips easily","These shorts are extremely comfortable, and do their job. However, I have had several pair that rip in the inner thigh. My most recent pair ripped after only 3 months of use, being worn 1-2x per week. Simply not worth the $."
5,Work like they should,"I bought the compression shorts for running and general workouts. The fit comfortably, and are exactly what I wanted. Under Armour makes great stuff, even though it can be costly."
4,Good Service!!,"Great Product!! very useful, good quality, i love it, the price it is ok, and the size two. I will buy it again!!"
2,Wrong Size,"I ended up with two garments two sizes too large on a reorder. Same UA top quality, but not the right fit."
5,Fit and work Great,"These are very comfortable and fit and work great. I wear them under my 10"" UA shorts so they don't peek out the bottom like some of the other compression shorts.The compression shorts really help avoid the leg rubbing of shorts or creeping when on the treadmill or elliptical. I'm ordering more."
1,Suspected Fake if Bought from Dealer: FogDog,"I know this is a product review, but I need to bring up that I have bought over 20 pairs of these Under Armour Heatgear Compression shorts in the past, but if bought from this company, I suspect they may be fake. The material in the shorts as well as the band are rougher and seem of a lower grade material then what I've bought directly from ""Under Armour"". Two of my three pairs bought here have had the bands separate from the shorts with normal washing/wearing over a 2 month period. For reference, the oldest pair I have from ""Under Armour"" has lasted over 3 years with normal washing/wearing!!!"
5,Excellent product,"I bought these because I play Ultimate Frisbee, I bought one initially and loved it so I bought another one. I wish they were a little longer but they work fine nevertheless."
5,Worth Every Penny,"This was my first purchase from UnderArmour, and I'm sure it won't be the last if the rest of their products are as good as this one. The fit is perfect as well as the support. I'm not knowledgeable enough to talk about the technical features so all I can say is that I'll buy a few more as I can't imagine wearing anything else. It feels that good."
4,Good for the price,"Bought this as a lower-cost alternative to Futuro's ""Infinity"" knee support (see my review of that). This is reasonably supportive, does the job I need it for, smaller (so it works better under clothes, etc) but less comfortable than the ""Infinity"". Not as good kneecap stabilization, either. I use this for shorter and less vigorous workouts and sometimes normal day-to-day activities; bends more easily than the larger support so more comfortable to sit. Pretty much stays in place (if you measure and get the right size...). Box says ""hand wash"" but I use washer/dryer cold/low and it seems fine. Latex rubber so those allergic need to beware."
2,Not stabilizing enough!,"I ordered this Futuro Stabilizing Knee Support because I wanted a beige colored one(I have a black McDavid knee brace and it did not come in beige), but I was a little disappointed with it. I don't get the support I get with my McDavid one. I will still use the Futuro, but not for walking for a long distance."
1,Bad Inventory,"Your inventory of Futuro Knee braces is bad and is being investigated by one of your Customer Service persons. I speak with confidence because I have worn the same brand, style, and size brace for years. The first shipment of 2 braces consisted of one correct package but the other was a ""small"" size clearly marked [package and product lable] as ""medium"". When the exchange shipment arrived, both packages contained ""small"" size braces but the lables and packages were clearly marked ""medium"".Both shipments have been returned in the last few days. In my mind this is obviously a manufacturers problem. To this day Amazon has been trying to resolve this issue. I am waiting for instructions on how to obtain the proper items."
4,These Guys Just Keep Getting Better!,"Little Charlie and the Nightcats continue to showcase their brand of California Jump blues with their new release ""That's Big"". The Nightcats style has always involved a unique combination of swing, jazz, R&B and Chicago blues all combined with often comical real life lyrics. On ""Desperate Man"" for example, vocalist/harpist Rick Estrin laments over being in love with a woman he just can't stand. While the title track ""That's Big"" places the big woman, as the object of his desire. There are a couple of guest appearances on the CD that are noteworthy. Rusty Zinn plays guitar on the instrumental ""Bluto's Back"" and guitar and vocals on the slow paced R&B number, ""It Better Get Better"". While Icepick James Harman joins the fun singing backup vocals on ""That's Big"". This disc has it all, guitars, harp, organ, sax, piano and plenty of wit and fun. Another winner for Chalie Baty and Rick Estrin."
5,West Coast Jump Blues at its best!,"If you are a blues fan and have yet to experience the West Coast Blues scene or Little Charlie and the Nightcats in particular, BUY this CD! 'Little' Charlie and Rusty Zinn offer up some smokin' solos on ""Bluto's Back"" that boggle the mind. Once you hear this offering, you'll be back to the store buying all the rest. Great party music! Also recommend Rod Piazza, Rusty Zinn, Kid Ramos."
3,Could not get past the leading lady,"I am obviously in the minority here as Many other reviewers loved Janet Gaynor in the role of Esther/Vicki, but I didn't buy her as a Hollywood star for a minute. She was too old for the role in the first place, and her hair and makeup were absolutely matronly. She looked like a little mouse next to the statuesque, stunning young woman Norman brought as a date to the party at which Esther was waitressing, For me, Miss Gaynor, in her early thirties at the time, strained credibility too much playing an ingenue. It can be done. See Bette Davis in the film ""In This Our Life"" , playing 21-ish when she herself was 37. Wardrobe, hair and makeup!"
3,What a disappointment!,"The film itself is great, of course, as an idealised view of Hollywood in its golden period. What a pity that it's taken from a battered old print of dubious provenance, despite the claim that it has been ""digitally remastered"".Our local ITV station ran a much better print than this about 20 years ago."
1,Beware,Buyers should beware of this video since it is of very poor quality being taken from a less than perfect 16mm. print. We are accustomed to much better prints these days and this one is being sold under false pretence.
4,"Original, Compelling Drama","""A Star Is Born"" the 1937 release is excellent drama and with the theme of fame and popularity. It is done in Technicolor, and is not the musical version with Judy Garland done in the 1950's. This original stars Janet Gaynor as a promising Hollywood starlet known as ""Vicki Lester"" - she came from a farm family, and her original name was Esther Blodgett. Sometimes her character tends to be an overly sweet hayseed, but she keeps her vital with excellent acting. Frederick March stars as the established movie star, ""Norman Maine"" who falls in love with and helps Esther start her career, but he realizes as her star rises, his is fading. He is a heavy drinker, older and a proud man. Seeing that he is sinking into obscurity, he cannot play second fiddle and commits suicide.This version stands up well even today and has great stars such as Gaynor and March as well as supporting cast of Adolphe Menjou, Andy Devine, Carole Landis, and Lionel Stander."
2,"I AGREE THAT THIS IS NO ""RESTORATION""","At paying full price at $29.99 at Barnes & Noble and reading that it was a restored print from George Eastman House, I was expecting a lot more than what I saw. The DVD from a few years ago was better than this, though still flawed and needing further restoration. I give 2 stars only that the story is still one of the greatest regarding Hollywood of yesteryear. The transfer to Bluray is a shear disappointment, sound & picture, especially when one of the trailers for ""Nothing Sacred"" with Carole Lombard that is included in the Features portion is in so much better shape than this film. That film was restored. Someone needs to call Martin Scorcese, Thelma Schoonmaker & their teams to get this one back into pristine condition. I'm not wasting money on this classic again until it is fully remastered the way ""Gone With The Wind"" was done. Flawlessly."
3,Blu-ray is a big disappointment,"The Blu-ray doesn't look much better to me than previous DVD releases I've seen, which isn't saying much, and is a shame. Its been transferred from an available print, but not ""restored"", just cleaned up somewhat. I'm not particularly a fan of this dark and artificial film, but I'm a HUGE fan of Technicolor restorations on Blu-ray which can sometimes be jaw-dropping; this isn't one of them. Its possible that there isn't any better source-material extant and nothing better will ever be available; the original Technicolor materials are often long-gone, especially for the earliest pictures like this one."
5,Boosts milk supply quickly,"This product is great. Your milk supply will increase just like promissed in 1 - 4 days. The only down side is the taste. I recommend positioning the dropper way at the back of the throat so you don't taste it as much when you drop it in your mouth. After a little while, the taste doesn't bother you as much. It really works, so I truely recommend it."
1,Yuck!,"Absolutely disguising, I had to hype myself up to swallow it down and it didn't even work for me. If there is a pill form, try those because this was GROSS"
5,Lots of Milk!,"When I started using this, I was a bit skeptical. But within a week I saw a differences. I use to only be able to pump 2 oz at most and after starting with this product I would get 6- 8 oz every time I pumped. Its great! Yes the taste is bitter but the milk starts flowing!"
2,Didn't Really Work for Me,This product was recommended to me by my lactation consultant and was said to be much stronger than drinking the Mother's Milk tea and more effect than using the More Milk Plus capsules. I followed the directions exactly as followed in terms of not drinking fluids 15 minutes before/after taking this and tried it for a over a week. I barely saw any increases in my milk supply at all. Maybe this just didn't work for me.
5,thank you!,Great product Just as promised. It really does work . just dont drink anything before or after using it. I highly recommend it
2,Motherlove More Milk | doesnt work,This stuff tates horrible smells horrible and does not work. My daughter has actually had less milk production since shes started using it. After weeks of hopeing it would start working she has completely quit using it and has thrown it away. I would not recommend this product to anyone.The company who shipped to me were great!!!! I received the product way before i expected I would.
2,Little results - if any,"Wife didn't have any luck with this product. Much more luck with the fenugreek. She also claimed this tasted like ""goat ass."" She has a way with words. The do not drink before and after instructions are a pain. That and the taste of goat ass that you can't wash away makes this a lowsy product."
3,upset tummy,Day two and my baby has been fussy & my stomach has been upset both days. The taste is horrid and it doesn't help that you can't consume anything for fifteen minutes after taking it. But........it is effective in increasing your milk supply. My milk came back within two hours after the first dose.
2,Contains Alcohol,"I'm not going to go into the effectiveness of Motherlove's More Milk Plus but want to warn - Careful, this particular formula has grain alcohol. I bought without knowing or realizing it. I have been using the one WITHOUT alcohol and ran out so bought this on Amazon and noted that it tasted different - it burns (like taking straight shots of vodka) and tastes bad. Upon checking ingredients it shows 42-52% grain alcohol!My preference is for the one without alcohol because it tastes sweeter (actually got so used to it I ended up liking it very much - imagine my distaste when I first put this in my mouth). Not only that, it makes me uncomfortable worrying about traces of alcohol in my b-milk.So 2 stars for this but I'd give the one w/o alcohol 5 stars because it helps with production."
2,didnt seem to do any good,"had twins. bought this when having trouble with one not nursing as well as my milk slowed down. did not really seem to make a difference in the amount of milk. tasted gross, I would take it in a shot of water. contains alcohol from the natural herbs. I think its better to nurse often to get better milk as that made a bigger difference on its own than when I used this in conjunction with more nursing, probablly from the alcohol?"
2,Alcohol taste is horrible!,"I did not see a increase in supply with this product. I did notice that my pumped milk was more fatty after sitting in the fridge though. I was taking a double dose and took it round the clock, never missing a dose. I am past a year of breastfeeding and that may be why I did not see a boost. The alcohol taste is completely disgusting. I felt like my breath reaked of the alcohol afterwards and I just couldn't rid the taste from my mouth for several hours. If I try it again with future children, I will definately make sure I get the alcohol free version!"
3,"This is More Milk, NOT More Milk Plus!","Title and image say ""More Milk Plus""; this is ""More Milk"". Difference is that MMP has fenugreek in it and this doesn't. I found out the issue when I received it; fortunately it works out for me as my baby may be allergic to fenugreek (we're still tracking the source of the reaction down.) Not sure how it works yet, but I'm a bit miffed at getting something that wasn't what I thought I ordered.Doesn't taste particularly nice, but tinctures generally don't; just squirt it down the back of your tongue or add it to 1-2oz of water or juice and it helps."
4,works well but sweat smells diferent,"I've been using this product for over a week after having supply issues at 11months when i started working, it workds for sure, tastes like crap like everyone says, the only weird thing that i haven't read anyone else say is... my armpits smell diferent! like the maplely smell the product has... i tried taking the pills instead and the same thing happens, ut doesn't bother me that much i just find it funny"
4,It helps...,"...but it's disgusting. It's taste equivalent would be what I imagine stuffing your face full of dandelions and old socks would be. It says not to drink but 1-2 ounces of liquid after you take it but it's a nearly impossible task, unless you like suffering. I would recommend it only to those who don't gag very easily. But if you are desperate for help with milk, hold your nose and droppers up!"
1,Dumping it down the drain,"This product obviously works well for most but it made my twins extremely fussy, gassy, and spit up like crazy. Not only did I hate to see them screaming with discomfort, but it was the hardest day I've had yet as a new mom to twins. Yes, I said ""day."" I took MMP as directed for only one day. The babies fussed all day and night leaving me no time to pump to even see if there was an increase in supply. I cut out the MMP and went back to plain fenugreek the next day and everyone is happy again. I'm pretty sure it's the blessed thistle that caused the issues. I tried previously adding blessed thistle capsules to my supplementation routine and we had similar issues, although not anywhere near the degree as with MMP. I hate leaving a negative review for a product so widely loved and touted, but I didn't find anything about effects similar to my experience so I felt the need to share."
2,"Original poem not used, images were of modern players","There are several altered versions of Thayer's classic poem in existance.This book uses one of them.I love this poem, and I wish the author had stuck with the original.Especially when Ernest Lawrence Thayer is listed as the author!Also- the images of Casey and the spectators are of modernday participants. Casey is wearing a helmet and his name andnumber are on the back of his uniform. Not like a playerin 1888 at all.Leroy Neiman is a great artist, and that is the only reason I give this2 stars."
2,Bodybuilder to Screen,Steve Reeves.The Hercules-Movies started Reeves' career and showcase him rather good.The digital quality is dabateble as well as the storyline. It's almost not worth the time it takes you to watch it.
3,Poor Public Domain Recording,"I remember watching this classic on Saturday mornings (some years back). Okay - my purchase is a nostalgia trip. This is my evaluation of this recording of a public domain movie:PLUSESMindless entertainment featuring the premier bodybuilder turned actorNot a DVD with movies on both sidesFOIBLESPoor construction of DVD entries/featuresMovie ""special features"" resolve to opening screen (choice of either feature)First feature, Hercules, goes black screen and does not resolve to menu after playingSUMMARY: What can you expect for less that $4? Use a torrent download if you want a better production."
3,A Good Start,"There aren't a lot of books available about traveling in Europe with children, so I snapped this one up awhen I saw it. It has helpful information and good tips, but I was hoping for more. I found it lacking in giving specific activities that would interest children in given cities. The list of suggested book for kids was excellent, however. This book is a good start if you're heading to Italy with your children, but it won't be the only homework you'll need to do."
2,Not realistic,"I was very disappointed with this book. I took 2 books it was ITALY DISCOVERY JOURNAL I turned to and it is the one my kids enjoyed the most. Pat had great insight about how to make your kids part of the experience, they will always remember this trip as with ITALY DISCOVERY JOURNAL they were part of the decisions."
1,"Unless your kids are over 12, leave them home with Grandma","There is nothing, I repeat, NOTHING in Italy that would appeal to a child under the age of 12. This book is a waste of money. If your kids are under 12, take them to Disneyland/World and save yourself a lot of money and whining."
5,Most excellent,"This CD is quite a bit different than these guys first CD, but it is the same in that every single song is worth listening to. This CD is a little more mellow than the first, but is still very upbeat. This is one of my favorite albums, it just doesnt get old."
4,Operation Sorespot,"This is a fictional account of a true event in history, but it is loaded with factual imformation. If you enjoy reading conspiracy theories you will love this book. The questions raised in the book are quite interesting. The reader should have fun trying to separate the fictional events from the factual ones. Many have described it as a real page-turner."
1,substandard quality,"I have ordered this item 3 times, while the shape makes cutting easier than normal end cutters such as channel lock the quality of the metal blade is not good. The item listing claims to be for heavy use and all3 I ordered chipped within a couple days of use making the tool useless."
4,Nice end clips,"These are nice trim-duty end clips. I wouldn't want to snip anything larger than 18gauge wire, but they are great for trim work."
3,"Not my favorite, but enjoyable.","I have enjoyed Anne Perry's books for many years, but Slaves left me rather cold. The journey several characters make to America at the beginning of the Civil War seems so unreal, perhaps because I am a Southerner whose great-grandfathers fought on both sides of the the great divide. I think, though, that the lack of shame and consequences of a 16 yr.old girl's running away with a much older man, even crossing the ocean and becoming involved with the soldiers, is the greater cause of my dissatisfaction. Where's the outraged mother? Where are the conversations concerning her ruination and lack of future prospects due to her sullied reputation? Why did the Union officer not even think of sending her back home? The book seems hurried and Perry sounds out of her depth."
3,Slaves of Obsesseion,Quite in keeping with the series. Good character development.A good read; as usual with Anne Perry! One can actually feel the quality of life in that era and the attitudes then prevalent.
3,"Good start , but a rushed ending.","I didn't find this book to be one of Anne Perry's better books. It began with the same pizzaz as usual in a William Monk mystery, and grabbed my attention straight away. However, by the middle of the book the plot began to get tepid and by the end of the book the ending seemed rushed and unbelievable."
4,Is it Lyman Breedlove or Lyman Breeland?,"This book was an intricate victorian mystery with historical overtones and I enjoyed it. But I was confused during the whole book, looking for Lyman Breeland to be revealed as some kind of dual personality or undercover spy, because the flyleaf write-up on the hardbound version refers to him as Lyman Breedlove. What gives? I spent the whole book looking to solve this puzzle and by the end it was obviously a (major) publishing faux pas. Anybody else find this?"
2,This seems like an excuse to get Hester back on the battlefield.,"Not one of the stronger entries in the series, SLAVES OF OBSESSION suffers from too many set pieces and not enough of the emotional complexity usually found in this series. Far too much time is spent on the philosophical battle between Union and Confederate issues; battles better detailed in many other works, and not enough on developing a strong narrative. The trip to America for Monk and Hester to recapture an American and his runaway English teen on a charge of murder is relatively ridiculous and only serves as an opportunity for Perry to showcase Hester's nursing ability. It's an interesting scene, but really just fills pages and does not move the narrative forward. Even the mystery's solution resolution left me less than satisfied, a perfunctory ending to a pedestrian entry in the series."
3,Tedious,"The transcriber of these songs has done a meticulous job, however for practical purposes, we'd like to incorporate the vocal (or melody) WITHIN the piano part. This collection is meant more for pianists who will comp for a vocalist; the pianist should be able to read split-hair rhythms and multi-layered, counter-rhythmic voicings. My piano students would like to play these songs, but would find this version tedious & discouraging."
4,Very good,"Here you'll find Elton John's music transcribed down to a tee. This is a welcome change to nonsensical 'interpretations' that conspicuously sound exactly the same as the melody line. You want to play 'Bennie and the Jets' from the starting heavy chords to the verse to the jazzy piano solo, here you go. Blue Eyes, Rocket Man, Someone Saved My Life Tonight (excellent song)... it's all here. In some instances (like Honky Cat for example), there's just no point in bothering to learn the music EXACTLY, because Elton John just improvised within chords in the first place. So it's best for you to do the same unless you want to pore through pages of the same music phrased slightly differently. Next time it would be better to include the more 'precise' songs in Elton's catalogue.Anyway, this is a great collection. Some of the songs aren't very well known but get the album they're on and you're away. Hours of fun."
4,updated from the 1928 version,"this books whose 1928 version is highly sought after, capitalizes on the former, but includes more modern topics of relevance to today. the lions share of this text is unchanged as to style and philosophy. highly based on advanced calculus. for an exhaustive review see the following: [...]."
2,The display is only partially working.,The batteries are new and the watch TALKS .. but the numbers only partially show up on the display. The watch worked perfectly for the first few days then it started acting up .. I changed the batteries and the problem still exists.
3,WHERE IS CONDITIONING?????,"I love this CD, but where the hell is ""Conditioning"" thats one of his best, and its not even on this collection!"
4,"A Voice out of Texas History , bold and exciting","Interesting Texas stories told with a twang that rings true. Bigfoot was pure macho. He came to Texas to kill the man who killed a family member of his, and ended up killing many men who were trying their dang-dist to kill him."
4,Quite a story,"If Big Foot Wallace actually experienced these events he was a great frontiersman, Or was he a great storyteller? Everyone interested in western history will enjoy this book."
5,Very nice cut and quality,Fits me as if it were custom tailored. I highly reccomend this item. I have paid twice as much for shirts nowhere near as good as this one.
5,TREMENDOUSLY AWESOME MUSIC - MY FAVORITE ALBUM!,"I listened to this CD multiple times and I never got tired of it. I'm serious I even experienced several *astral projections* because it perfectly resonates to deep relaxation centers and it's hard to explain but it's gorgeous and incredible. I call this album ""mind candy"" because it gives me most delicious sensations and I ""go under"" very quickly and experience profound deep relaxation - to the point I really did have astral projections. It's the most amazing albumn I have EVER heard and I own a lot of CDs of this genre. THIS ALBUM IS THE ONE TO GET YOU WON'T BE SORRY - it's simply FANTASTIC BEYOND DESCRIPTION!!!"
2,maya,"I loved the cover when I saw it, and I was very excited to receive it. I like this artists music, but was not too thrilled with this CD. It was not what I thought it would be, and very ""jungle like"""
2,OOOOOMMMMMMMM,"Buy this at a discount price, it's not something you want to buy for $14.00 at a music store."
2,Sometimes you miss.,"As a fan of almost all the genres and sub-genres of music Brian Eno has had his hand in since 1972, I regretfully say that, other than for it's collectibility, this pricey set should not be sought by any but the most determined collectors. The packaging is 75% Japanese in both presentation and content, so it's not easy for foreigners to assimilate. Too, Eno, contributes musically to only 1 of the 2 cds, so it's ""half an Eno at thrice the price of one"". Perhaps he has achieved by issuing this a reduction on the demands for his attention and time. With a few more like this and some of it's Eno-involved predecessors since 1994, the wolves may stop circling his door for a while and he can breathe again and create something that has had time to gestate and mature before release."
4,"Pretty good value, well made doll, need patience !","I bought this doll for my daughter 2 years ago and just recently purchased this as a gift for a 7 year old. The food is pretty difficult to get into the dolls mouth, but the girls don't seem to care. They think the mess is fun (keep a wet washcloth and maybe a kitchen towel handy) and really get a kick out of the doll using her potty. You have be pretty patient to get the food in properly and then sit the doll just right in order for her to pass the pretend food.The bottle part is no problem, but lots of other dolls that cost considerably less will drink a bottle and use a potty.If you are the patient type and don't mind a mess at the kitchen table, then this doll is ok. If you want your daughter to entertain herself then get a cheaper doll that can use the potty."
1,wasted money,"I was looking for a doll-that-wets to help me potty train my 3 year old daughter. The doll was quite expensive, the only one with the feature I was looking for in that particular toy store. It comes without any instructions, or maybe they were missing from the box, but I really doubt that. When you give the doll water it instantly starts peeing, better when it is laying down than when it sits on the potty. No matter how you turn it and how you close or open the valve, IT LEAKS. I could not see any tears no matter how I turned it. Overall, big waste of money, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST IT. It makes a big title of glory that doesn't need batteries, but it absolutely does not rise to the expectations listed on the box, and I would personally get a battery doll that works, than this one."
2,Don't believe the marketing hype,"Water begins leaking out of the hole in the bottom almost as soon as you start feeding the doll, so be sure to have a diaper on. The Born brand diapers cost more per diaper than regular baby diapers and cannot be reused. Once they get wet, they must be thrown out. It would be better to make your own. My three year old daughter was horribly disappointed by the ""baby food"" which looked like water with small white particles floating in it. At least you can submerge the baby for a bath. It looks cute. It does come with a potty, but is not anatomically correct, so it may or may not be useful for potty training, depending on your child."
3,Ossessively searching for the perfect interactive doll!!,"I bought and interactive doll by Mattel a few years ago. It had ""real eyes"" that blink, gurgle and cried etc (I love her). She is a soft vinly with a soft body. Proportion andsize great. I keep thinking they will go a few steps further by developing one that can give facial expressions and wiggly its toes and fingers. Baby Born with Magic Eyes a bit more pricey than it should be (compared with some others similiar that I have seen since). I also bought the Amanda doll and Annabel. Annabel was priced three times the market value (I found her price later at less than $50.00) I definitely did not find her a good value compare to others I have seen and for the functions she has. However, Baby Magic is not too pricey. Great as an additional doll for any child collecting dolls--I would not discourage anyone from purchasing her."
5,"The Last Supper, 1497 is Magnificient!",This product was purchased for my daughter and son-in law for Christmas. They love it! I will buy more paintings from this company and highly recommend to others.
5,Of Mice and Men,"This book takes place in Soledad,CA. It taking about two migrant workers Lennie and George. George is ""small and quick and dark of face"". ""Lennie, a huge man has the mind of a young child"". George like a father that taking care his trouble son Lennie. Lennie is a trouble maker, he made a lot of trouble. Finally George can't help Lennie and he use a gun point on the back of lennie's head.Read on to find out what happened next.I give this book 5 stars, beacuse I like John Steinbeck's books."
4,Of Mice and Men,"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck was set during the Great Depression in CA. In this book there are two characters called Lennie and George. They are the two migrant workers, who had travel together and they want to save some money and buy a ranch of their own. George is a small person, ¡quick and dark of face¡. He always takes care of Lennie and he act like a father to Lennie. Lennie is a huge man and has a mind of a child. He always gets into trouble. Every time when Lennie gets into trouble, George always gets him out of the trouble. Lennie acts like a son to George. Will George and Lennie make their dream come true or will Lennie¡s weak mind and strong body destroy their dream?The book Of Mice and Men is a good book. I will rate it as four stars. In this book, it has a lot of conflicts and events. Also it tells us how important friendship is event if it is a very hard time. Friendship will help you get through anything."
5,"""OF MICE AND MEN""","The book ""Of Mice and Men"" by John Steinbeck, takes place in Soledad, C.A.,during the Great Depresion.The two main characters of the book are George and Lennie.They are good friends.Their relationship is complex and is like father and son.One of the theme of the book is "" Friendship"".This is the case of Lennie and George.But do you think that this relationship will be forever?Personally,I recommend this book because it is interesting,and it is a really good story, I give 5 stars to it.I learned that friendship is valuable and when you have a really good friend he/she can become more than a friend ""a Family""."
4,Preatty Cool Book!,"I thought the book was preatty cool. I liked it because it's a good story about friendship and how these two guys who have been through everything together were forced to break their friendship because of a tragic accident. It was a very sad book, but overall I thought it was preatty cool!!!"
4,"Very good book, could of been improved though","I just recently read John Steinbeck`s classic ""Of Mice and Men"", and I enjoyed it very much. Steinbeck`s technique of making books come alive is very visible in this novel. The story between the two main characters George and Lennie was very touching, and their experiences on a farm were richly described. But I think that this coming-of-age tale could of been so much better if it were longer and more elaborate. Other than the length, ""Of Mice and Men"" is a fantastic book."
3,Disappointed by the Novel!,"I watched the movie first, starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise and was so captivated by the touching story that I just couldn't get it out of my mind till I can buy a copy of the book and read it for myself. But boy, was I disappointed!! Although the movie followed the novel very closely, I was expecting more from the novel. The story was great but I really feel that the characterization of George and Lennie could be more developed in the novel."
4,"The first ""classic"" I liked.","I was reading cambridge histories of China when I was 11, but literary ""classics"" had never impressed me. (Although I've liked ""classic"" poems & short stories for years.) This was good & the ending was sad, but made sense. It was even foreshadowed. If you think this should've had a happy ending stick with TV sitcoms or kids books. If anyone else knows of a ""classic"" this readable I'd love to hear about it."
4,Even the toughest of men need friends.,"This book was on the requirement list to enter Honors English I in my town's high school. I found the book very intriguing. It shows you both life at its worst, and at its best. (Please don't ask me to elaborate :) !) The book also gives you an outlook on human nature as a whole. I found this book to be one of the most touching stories I have ever had the priviledge to read."
5,A wonderful masterpiece,Of Mice and Men was a wonderful book that went to the heart of the readers. Steinbeck did a great job of making the reader feel the pain of the tragedy that never should have happened. I give this book a 10 because it was heart warming but sad and it also gave you a good insight on how each character reacted and what they were like.
4,Of Mice and Men,"George and Lennie are very good friends. They are always doing things together and travel together. Lennie is the one who always makes trouble and Veorge always helps him. But now, Lennie just causes a serious problem that Veorge even can't help. Lennie is a huge guy, has a ind of a young child, and George is small and quick. Two of them are totally the opposite, not only the way they look, and the way they act, but they have a same dream. I like this book and I will recommend you to read it, because it is great and it will always give you surprise. Also, you will learn their friendship."
4,Companions,"George and Lennie were the best of friends. Lennie was a huge man. He was a hard worker. Lennie was not very smart. He got himself into alot of trouble because he could not understand many situations. Lennie's main concern was to pet nice things and that is what got him into the most trouble. With his size, Lennie did not even understand his own strength. George took care of Lennie. He did all the thinking that Lennie could not do himself. He had patience with Lennie, while other could not. No matter what he still stuck with Lennie and took care of him. Together, they had a dream and wanted so bad to reach it that they felt it was always within one step their grasp.This book showed the greatness of friendship. I would recommend this book to my friends because it shows the meaning of friendship and patience. This book is about dreams and how important they are in pushing someone to reach them."
4,Friendship,"Fiendship is very important to everyone. In this book Lennie always does something wrong, but he never know what is wrong. George is his only friend, always protects him from danger. They belong to each other. The ranch of Soledad is where they work. In this new work place, Lennie really keeps George in hot water and George has to make a hard choice. They have a sweet dream of land , which belongs to themselves. Will this dream come true? I like this book, because Steinbeck's story is so exciting that I held my breath until I finish reading to the end."
5,De Ratones a Hombres,"Two men travel together looking for work. They meet some workers named Curley, Slim, Candy, Carlson, and Crooks who live in a ranch.Lenny and George have to solve many problems in their lives. Lenny has to go through many difficulties as he is mentally challenged.In this novel we can see how the people from low social classes are treated inferiorly.In this tragic novel only one gets out alive!"
4,Of mice and men,"This is my favorite Steinbeck novel. It is a beautiful story and a must read. One of the few books that I would like to read again. Simply put, this is the story of a TRUE friendship between two men, one of whom is mentally challenged. Read it!!"
5,A Lesson in Human Tragedy,"This piece is ultimate Steinbeck. The author has limited his characters to two major ones and a few ancillary ones. The book is short, however, the tale is told thoroughly. The reader feels so very sorry for George. George is a study of loyalty, decency and patience and how one feels so utterly responsible for the life of another human being-in this case his childhood friend, Lennie, who is somewhat mentally challenged. This book is a sad account of the fragility of human beings and how one person will be loyal to the other person til the end-even if he needs to commit murder to show it. The character, Candy, is so very pathetic too and his comments about "" a stranger killing my old dog"" are so very sad! One tends to think that it was because of Candy feeling badly about a stranger killing his dog that George does what he does. This is a beautiful book!"
3,Of Mice and Men Audio CD,"Two things prevents this product from receiving 5 stars. One is the fact that the copy I received was scratched and skips in many different parts. The second reason is that the CD does not have any sort of guide to let one know where the audio starts and stops. If one is listening to it continuously, it is not a problem. Gary Sinise does a good job reading the different parts."
4,Authentic tragedy,"This is an authentic, somber tragedy, set in early 20th century California. We follow a dreamer, and his companion who is a child in a giant's body. They travel from place to place on foot to find work then to finally end up on a farm where dreams and life come to an end.Stienbeck depicts these pathetic, hard, and lost lives with an eye for detail. This is a simple story with a simple dialect. A good read.LORD BlessScott"
4,Wow - not hating Steinbeck,"I've always made a big deal about how much I do not like Steinbeck or Hemingway, but after reading a couple of both of theirs this year, I have to admit that I LOVE both. As far as Steinbeck, I know that I still despise The Grapes of Wrath, but this is an incredible book. Especially short and easy to read, the writing is simply superb. The characters are well-developed, the dialogue is simple and to the point, and the descriptions are detailed. This book deserves it's frequent consideration as a classic. And while I still can't imagine ever liking GOW, I can no longer dismiss Steinbeck."
4,"of mice and men,tweety,kmb,at maces lane middle school","of mice and men is a great book.my favorite character is lennie. lennie is my favorite character because he is so kind, he listens to george and he loves rabbits. lennie is always talking about livin off the fat of the land and tendin the rabbits. lennie is always getting himself and george into trouble and george always get them out. george has to take care of lennie because he has no one else. lennie has to be careful on the ranch because the bosses son curly sufers from little man sindrom and he hates leinne because he is so big. this book is filled with suspence so i would recommend you to read it"
3,Um...,"This book is about George and Lennie traveling together to soledad for jobs and hopefully they can own a farm by themselves. So they work hard. Lennie is a huge man, had the mind of a young child. George is small and quick. They're best friends. George always tries to protect Lennie from getting hurt. He helps Lennie to solve his problems and everything else. In the end everything is just not what i expected. This book is kind of interesting because it tells the meaning of friends and loneliness through life. And how white people discriminated against the Blacks back in the days. I do recommend this book if someone is looking to know how it's like to feel discrimated, loneliness and friendship."
3,"""of mice and men""","""Of Mice and Men"" by John Steinbeck is a very interesting story where two men with different personalities live their lives in a form of a ""family"". George and Lennie are the main characters of this story, between them exists a good balance because George is the one who posesses the intelligece and Lennie is the one who posesses the strength. George always tries to keep Lennie away from problems but can not guard lennie from the things that Lennie likes.""Of Mice and Men"" is a really good book so I`m going to give it 3 stars because from there you can learn and be excited at the same time .I think that you are never going to expect what is going to happen there, so try to read the book and then you will see that my recomendation is good"
4,the american dream,"the story of two young men George and Lennie,who travel together and share the same dream of being their own bosses and own a ranch which is the american dream.The story takes place at the Salinas river banks and at a ranch in California.It's prety good except for its lenght and sort of tragedyyou should read it do to its moral lessons.one of the major themes is lonelinessoverall a good book"
3,An okay read,"This is usually read by many high school students and that's how I came across it. Of Mice and Men shows the peculiar relationship between 2 men one being mentally ""slow"", they travel on farms together. This is a good read and it is entertaining. I only gave it 3 stars because I didn't finish the book with a strong feeling about it."
2,Of Mice and Men,"This book is about two hobos named George and Lennie. In the beginning of the story they are on their way to a ranch to earn a stake. When they get to the ranch they meet Candy, the one handed man, Slim the team leader, Curly the bosses son, and Curly's wife. Curly is always loosen his wife and can't find her. She tries to flurred with all the guy at the ranch. Lennie is in the barn petting his dead puppy when she comes to flurred and then something happens! You'll have to read the book to find out what happens."
3,Not all its cracked up to be,"This book is about two guys named George and Lennie who travel together. Lennie is retarded and George takes care of him. The ending is very sad. We read this book in my language class because its supposed to be really good, but I don't see what's so good about it."
4,Ms. Farvour's B 2/3 class,"John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is a wonderful book about life in the 1930's. Steinbeck tells about two men trying to make money and live on their own land, as many men drempt of back then. This was shown through one metaphore of Lennie (one of the main characters) wanting to tend to the rabbits. The rabbits really represented them being free.The characters in this book were really unique. George and Lennie are the main characters and they always stick together. Lennie is mentally sick, yet George sticks with him. The characters were a very beliavable pair because how they acted and their dreams of being free were very realistic.This is a good book to read for young americans and i gave it four stars. Although it is only 107 pages long there is a lot of content and makes you want to keep reading it. Many people dislkike the language in the book, but other people dont realize that this book shows the language that everyone hears in our society every day."
1,Grossly Overrated,"After the title I am with those that find the characters, story, ending, everything about this book without any interest. Personally I'm unable to fathom the good reviews this relatively boring book gets."
5,"George, Lennie and Gary Sinise","This audio production for ""Of Mice and Men"" by Gary Sinise is nothing short of brilliant. Over the years, Mr. Sinise has made John Steinbeck's work a part of his life, being involved with it in various mediums: live plays, a film, and this audio recording. As a result, he seems to have developed a deep connection to this story, and a lively and powerful rendering of the characters is what results. It is the perfect performance of a perfect book."
4,OF MICE AND MEN,"Have you ever read abook where you could relate to the characters? I have and this is why I liked OF MICE ANd MEN by John Stienback. Ialso like this book because it kept my attention. There weren't many chapters so it made it seem like it went faster.I enjoyed this book but theres one part I don't like. Just as the book got good one of the main characters accidently kills another. I wasn't expecting this.This author has a way of describing characters that made me relate to them. This made the story more interesting, so did the climax. I couldn't put the book down and the climax was the best part. this authors descriptive writing kept my attention with a great chapter book."
4,Of Mice and Men is a classic that should be read,As an English teacher I believe this is a novel that we should all read because of its iconic status in American literature. Many allusions are made to Lenny Smalls in film and literature which would go totally misunderstood if one had not read the novel. It is a quick and easy read.
3,book was good but the service was so slow,the book was fine but it took 2 weeks to get it and when i called to ask why i was told that was just the way it was im afraid i had to buy another copy so my daughter wouldnt fail her class so if you need something order it real early or get it from a bookstore close to home
5,Great book! One of my favorites.,"I love this book. This was my first Steinbeck novel, and I thought it was great"
5,Surprisingly good!,"This books is on most reading lists, and it is easy to understand why. Beyond merely a 'classic,' the book stands next to 1984 as literature that remains good reading long after it was written. The language is modern, the symbolism deep, and the story short but compelling.I've read Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, a book I did not enjoy very much. If you have enjoyed one of his previous books, regardless of the experience, I suggest picking up this book. If you haven't read his other works, I strongly suggest picking this one up first."
4,A must read,"This is one of these books that are on what I call the ""Moby D"" list.There are book and movies that you have to read and or see so that you can be a well rounded individual. At least in theory. I plan to make another list of books that everyone should read before they die. This is one of them so hop to it. Insightful and endearing and a easy read for a young adult. Great character studies."
3,Of Mice and Men,"This story is about two guys that stay together as they travel from job to job. Lennie, a big, dumbfounded guy, is always getting into trouble and his best friend George is always bailing him out. George can't look out for Lennie for the rest of his life and that means Lennie has to make his own decisions. Lennie gets into trouble and he doesn't even know it. He is always saved by George, so he doesn't have to worry about the consequences. But he will soon find out what the real world is like."
3,"Overated, yet a good novella all the same.","Of Mice and Men is a good novella with good characters and a creative plot. Steinbeck does an excellent job at portraying the lives of migrant farm workers, and develops an unlikely relationship wonderfully. The story itself has an interesting moral, and one of the largest hyperboles in the history of literature. However while i did say it was a good novella, I believe it would have made a better novel. The novella itself is crammed and packed with hidden meanings and themes (a literature teachers dream), yet i was left wanting more. It fell short in character development and story. While we were informed of the desperate flight from the first town, I would have liked to have had the escape described in more detail. I was just left wanting more (it doesn't help that steinbeck isnt my favorite author)."
3,Nice,"Of mice and men is the story of George and Lennie, two Californian workers that go from field to field in search of work. They're very close to each other and George takes care of Lennie, who has a mental disability. They finally seem to find an opportunity to settle down but their plans don't turn out as they wish. It is a rather short story, very easy to read."
5,Of Mice and Men Book,This bok was a great value and was perfectly described in the description. There wasm't a single flaw with it and would definitely reccomend buying it from amazon for the great deal.
3,Nice read,"This book is very nice to read because it shows many how people can get along and live with each other for a long time. I am a student in High School and I read this book with my sand it was fun to read. It wasn't hard to read at all but it was more difficult to analyzed. The characters in this book have very deep meaning and detail that can only be uncovered by actually analyzing it. This book may seem very boring if you read it from cover to cover without stopping to think about the time period, the characters, and the setting. I would recommend this book for someone who likes to read about things that were made in the past because it refers to many things of the 1930's. I enjoyed reading this book and I liked learning about the theme in it. I would recommend for a teenage audience and up."
3,"Well done audiobook, but disturbing story","Gary Sinise does an amazing job of bringing the story and characters in ""Of Mice and Men"" to life in the complete and unabridged audiobook.Having said that, the story itself is rather disturbing and one wonders why it became required reading in so many high schools across the land.It's a an interesting time peace, reflecting the Great Depression in California, but these are rough characters, with rough language and behavior. There are so many more uplifting works of fiction out there for our young people to read or hear."
2,Are you kidding me?,"Of Mice and Men was an assigned reading in my class. At first I thought it was good (in the first chapter), but then I read on. The book did not suit me. I would not recommend this book to anyone, because I thought it was a bad story. The author's writing style was good, but the plot was stupid. Some of the characters were believable, but others were very inrealistic. The ending was very sad, and you would have never seen it coming."
2,Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck,The book is about two guys going from field to field for jobs. George is a small man that protects Lennie. Lennie is a very big man with the mind of a child. The story takes place on a field in California. I disliked the book because to me it was stipid. George is always yelling at Lennie and telling him what to do. Then what George does to Lennie at the end is sad and mean. you would need to read the book yourself to make a decision on it.
4,The Best Book I Have Ever Read,This is a great Book plain and simple. It displays a great ironic message of love and friendship. The story is deeply moving and evokes terrific emotion. As the story moves along you feel you know and love the characters yourself. You really feel for the characters and their situations. I love this book.
5,Outstanding novel,"I thought this book to be one of the best novels that I've read. I also did a duo interpertation of this book for speech and my partner and I did very well we took sixth in state. Anyone who gave it less than at least five stars can't see the true meanings and feelings that the author intended for this book. It show's peoples differences with one another, but how they can still be connected. This book was awesome."
4,"Of Mice and Men, Shelley","It was a good book and I enjoyed reading it. I got into it when I started reading it, but I thought it had to much foul language, and I didnt really like the way it ended."
3,"Well written, but very depressing material","If you love well written books and don't care if the ending is happy or sad then this is the book for you. However, if you are like me and enjoy well writen books, but must have a happy ending then you will want to avoid this book. Steinbeck has a wonderful writing style with excellant descriptions of nature. Of Mice and Men also very accurately depicts what life was like during The Depression. Unfortunately as it takes place during The Depression it is very depressing. Of Mice and Men tells the story of two best friends George and Lenny. George is the leader of the two, while Lenny who is mentally retarded is the willful and very sweet follower. Both are 30 years old, but neither acts his age. While George acts older and more mature, Lenny has the IQ of a four year old. This problem is the theme of the entire book. I hope you enjoy Of Mice and Men."
3,Good Book,"I thought that Of Mice and Men was a good book. I enjoyed all of the action that took place. Especially when they arrived at the ranch to work. Between all of the fights, the girls, the puppies and the work it was very interesting. I thought that it kept you wanting to read it. I also think that Linnie made the book because you never knew what he was going to do or what was going to happen next. I enjoyed the book and I hope you will too."
4,"Has everything in it emotional, suspensful,romance,drama","A great read from start to finish. I loked the characters and there emotion from the start to the shocking ending. This book has everything in it romance,suspense,drama,humor. The book is written great and it deals greatly with the depression. It shows how real friends act and how they deal with the emotion they went through."
3,A VELEZ - MY REVIEW,I honestly thought that the book was interesting. It was a class requirement but I would've borrowed it from a library or bought it from a bookstore. It is a literary classic about two men trying to survive the great depression. The book also has great context and include passages where you could make world -to -text connections. The format of the book is sequential and foreshadows various times in few events. It also is short (great for those people who don't like to read long novels) and manages to compress a detailed story. If you are still pondering about purchasing or reading Of Mice And Men after reading this and maybe other reviews just give it a shot its worth reading.
3,"Good Story, Tragic Ending (M. Pantoja)","In the book Of Mice And Men, two men named George and Lenny, encounter many difficulties regarding their friendship. Lenny is mentally challenged and totally depends on George. In the beginning of the story, they work in a farm but unfortunately lose their job, because of an incident regarding a woman in a pretty dress. Later on in the story, they find another job in a new farm. In this new job, they come across a woman whose hobby is to flirt with every guy she sees. As soon as the flirtatious woman notices Lenny, she starts flirting with him. Dumbfounded, Lenny reacts by telling George. This woman's action is what led to the drastic decision George has to make at the end of the story, concerning his and Lenny's friendship. This is a great book that is easy to read and is very suspenseful, because u never know what the outcome of the story will be. I know you will enjoy reading this book as much as I did."
3,Don't remember making this purchase,I really don't remember making this purchase. Was it a download? When was it? I wonder where it went ?
2,Bought it used and part of the back of the book was torn in half,"This is a great book, especially if you actually understand the symbolism. However, I bought it ""used and in good shape."" It was NOT in good shape. The last probably 25 or so pages looked like a dog had chewed it to shreds. I could read some of the pages, but others were completely confusing without the other half. I would recommend this book, but I would not recommend that you buy it used."
2,Boring,"I was made to read this for English and thoroughly disliked every moment of it. I thought the plot was boring and it wasn't nearly as good as everyone appears to believe it is.The only reason I am not giving 1 star is because when I look back on the story I can sort of see it being realistic, but then again every time I hear mention of this book I pretty much get nightmares."
4,of mice and men,Of Mice and Men was a very good book in my opinion. I liked it because it was about two guys pursuing a dream. George is a very smart person who knows what he wants out of life. Lennie on the other hand isn't very smart and gets into trouble alot. George basically take cares of Lennie and trys to keep him out of trouble. They both start working on a ranch in California and try to earn money so they can have there own place with a few acres. The ending is very good and unexpected that is what makes this novel great.
3,SAD BOOK,tHIS BOOK IS NOT TOO BAD OF A BOOK ONCE YOU REALLY GET INTO IT.iTS ACTUALLY INTERESTING WHEN YOU GET INTO IT.iT STARTS OUT GOOD AND THEN SAD IN THE ENDING. tHIS BOOK WOULD MAKE YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO TREAT CERTAIN PEOPLE OR ANY PERSON.tHIS BOOK WAS ALRIGHT BUT IT GOT SAD AND IT MADE ME MAD.aLTHOUGH IT DIDNT REALLY HAVE ANY ACTION IT WAS ALRIGHT.THE BOOK IS NOT BIG THE CHAPTERS ARE SMALL AND THE WORDS ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO READ.tHERE JUST WASNT ENOUGH SEASONING IN THIS BOOK.
3,"Student on ""Of Mice and Men""","The book ""Of Mice and Men"" was about two men that had been chased out of their old town. They are sent out to find a new job so they can fulfill their dream of having their own land. When something goes wrong at the ranch, Lennie must hide out until George comes back to get him. Lennie ends up killing the bosses' sons' wife which leads to an unforgettable twist that will shock you. I really enjoyed the book. The only thing I didn't like was there were a few boring parts that described the scenery but there's a reason for that. this book if for young adults because of the Aurthors writting style. I like this book because it makes you think and you have to remember everything you read."
3,of mice and men,Well this is my first time to read one of John Steinbeck book.Mice and men was so great it was really an interesting one. I hope you would like it too.
3,Of Mice And Men,"OF MICE AND MENOf Mice And Men was a good book. The author does a good job describing the characters and the scenery at the beginning of each chapter. Lennie was a tall man and liked soft things. He liked them so much that it got him into trouble. I would recommend this book to older kids because of the language. John Steinbeck wrote a great book and it was very interesting. I liked how Lennie carried a dead mouse in his pocket and George yelled at him and threw the mouse away. My favorite part of the book was the fight between Lennie and Curley, the boss's son. Lennie and George have a dream of getting a ranch of their own with rabbits and a few pigs and they are going to live off the fat of the land. But first they have to raise a stake at a nearby ranch. That's when the problems start"
3,OF MICE AND MEN,"Of Mice and MenI thought Of Mice and Men was a good book that gives insight to the depression. The author tells it how it really was and allows the reader to understand the people, like where they were coming from and how they got to the place they were. The other thing I liked about this book was how the author takes the all too real setting of the story and makes it a light and almost humorous. With a great ending, this seemingly boring book enters the hearts and minds of its readers. In closing I would give this book, on a scale of one to ten, an eighth."
4,Read this book!!,I thought that Of Mice and Men was a pretty good book. It told a story of a relationship between two friends. How they traveled around together and how they tried to find and keep a job. If you don't like cussing in a book then this is not the one to read. Otherwise it was really good.
3,"Good book, clever plot, lacking something...","We were asked to do a research project of John Steinbeck, the author of ""Of Mice and Men,"" so I have some knowledge of his background and life. I personally felt that he could have done a lot more with this book, even though everyone in the US (practically) read it. The characters, to me, lacked a personal touch, and even though Lennie and George traveled and lived together, there was something missing in their relationship, along with their relationship to everyone else in the book. They lacked a closeness, a togetherness. The story to, me also felt like it was held together by just a few plot ""enhancers."" Although Steinbeck described the setting and plot thoroughly, to me it lacked a past, present and future. ""Of Mice and Men"" did hold my interest and kept me reading past our deadline. I would recommend this book to a reader that doesn't want to get too ""involved"" with the book."
3,My opinion,"I just finished the book and I think it was interesting. I liked how the author developed the main characters.One had,characteristics the other one needed so they complemented each other.The character that I found special was George because he was a leader who guided and protected the dumb character. The themes in this story were interesting and real.As regards the plot ,I enjoyed it because there was suspense , sensitibity and violence.I believed tha the ending was very good since it was real. However, I didn't like the long descriptions the author included.I didn 't find it easy to read it because of the language used by the characters ,but I realize it was suitable for poor workers with no education."
4,Of Mice and Men,"This story is about two rural farm workers, Lennie and George. They try and acheive their dream of owning their own house on an acre of land. They are close to reaching their goal with the help of Candy, and old swamper on the farm, but Lennie ""done another bad thing"".I liked this book. It showed the theme of friendship throughout the whole book. It is very realistic. I would recommend this book for young adults.Ms. Redmon-Period 6"
4,of mice and men,"In John Steinbeck 1937 novel there are two men one named Lennie who is a tall, big, squared man who faces mental problems and his friend, George, who has known Lennie for as long as he can remember. George is a skinny man that sometimes gets annoyed by Lennie's mental problems. Lennie and George live and work on a simple and plain ranch and have many dreams and stories behind ranch they work at. The ending of this book is very shocking. I suggest that kids of the age 13 and below should not read this book. If you want a steady pace and shocking ending book, then you got to read ""Of Mice and Men""."
3,Do I like this book? Why or why not.,I like this book because it's showing a nice relationship bewteen a retarded black person and a white person and how they interact with each other and how they treated each other back then. Also how every one was treated back then. And how Lennie was treated by the characters in the book.
5,Of Mice and Men,"John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is definitely now one of my favorite literature novels that I have read in English class. This book was one that I could actually picture in my head and imagine what was really happening in the story. I found myself not wanting to put it down until I finished reading it completely. George and Lenny, otherwise known as John Malkovich and Gary Sinise, were great characters and each perfect for the part that they contributed in the story. These two characters had a remarkable relationship and the way Steinbeck portrayed it told me a lot. They shared good times, bad times, and sad times together, but no matter what, there was still a connection between them. Though I was required to read it I am now very thankful that I did. It was a great novel and I would honestly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good piece of literature."
5,A Touching Tale On Man's Tragic Fate.,"A story of two men contrasting in physical & mental conditions but united in a deep & trusting bond whose dreams are shattered by life's sinister twist;is handled very well by Steinbeck's gifted touch for the realistic.His lyrical catch-scapes prove daunting & impenetrable though,hindering the flow of the dialogues bet. the characters,where the strength of the novel lies.His style of prose fits more for a screenplay,& it's no wonder that the film of this work was done so well.The end is a dissapointment when one has seen the film;nevertheless,the work is a moving portrayal of human relationships in the inevitability of man's destiny & his helplesness in trying to avert it."
4,what would have happened after?,"Great book! My question- what would have happened after George killed Lenny? My class is doing a mock Trial of a time when they come to get George for murdering Lenny. As his defense attorney, I will show how Lenny's murder was not pre meditated as George was mostly convinced by Slim."
5,Surprisingly Good=)!!,"This book was one that i wish i would of read when i was suppose to in 9th grade. It was once we reached the middle of the book i realized how good it was. I am one of those students who hate reading those long novels about nothing important. Even though my teacher said it was one of the shortest novels we would ever read! After only reading the middle to the end. I just had to check this book out for myself! Once you begin this book, you may think it starts off boring..but keep going becuase youll never want to put it down. It teackes you about loyalty and friendship in real life situations. This is a book i would read over and over again!.Try this book out..you'll really like it!"
5,Timeless...,"The books appears to be merely entertaining until you reach the end. Memorable characters. Excellent ending. Colorful setting. This is some of the best American literture.Also of interest: you know the big dog in Looney Tunes cartoons that always asks the smaller dog to tell him about ""the bunnies"". That character is taken from this book."
3,Of Mice and Men,"At only 107 pages ""Of Mice and Men"" is a short but to the point book. The story goes though the feelings about the ups and downs of relationships and how far they will go until someone breaks. Lennie and George are the main characters. Lennie is mentally Challenged, and really big and strong. George really wants to pursue ""The American Dream"" also he is kind of tells Lennie what to do, to keep out of trouble. I like George a lot; he is the smarter of the bunch. But I do not like Lennie at all; he does things that I don't really agree with. The story has much detail but yet is short enough to be a novel. The characters are not the smartest of all people. The book is okay in my opinion, not one of my favorites because I didn't feel it had a good pull on you, but the ending is what saved it, it has a totally unexpected twist of an ending.brandon_m"
3,Josh Welch,"All together the plot of this...interseting tale of two men(one slower than most) was alright. But there was a reocuring item,Lenny always getting into trouble with women but i guess this was an interesting and dependent part of the plot. The main focus of the book was how this very exploratory man with below average intelligence,Lenny, is being basically cared for and looked out for by his friend,George,who is just tryin to make money so someday he can have his farm with his dumb but sometimes helpfull friend. I myself thought the book as alright but not the best. The whole book is actually not very long and does not tell a whole lot about their past."
5,Always good...,When asked I tell people OF MICE AND MEN is my favorite book.My youngest son had to read it for ninth grade English class and was exclaiming over it. I have read it numerous times but not for many years. I bought a copy and read it again. It is always good. The dark themes remind me that the misfits of the world have a place but too often it is a place with tragic consequences that effect us all and always will.
5,"Heartwrenching, Beautiful","These are the two words I have to describe this book. It's a short work of genius, and it fully immerses you in its world for the all-too-short time that it lasts. With its masterfully crafted characterization and storyline woven so perfectly, it has you tightly wrapped around its proverbial fingers until its heartbreaking conclusion."
4,Of Mice and Real Men,This was a very brief but very engaging story wonderfully read by Gary Sinise. It is very touching and I didn't want it to end the way it did but I knew it had to. Great Story.
3,Beau m and thomas laperch,"The book ""of mice and men""was a very odd book. ITs about 2 charecters lennie and george. Lennie is a big burly man whos mentally retarded. George is traveling with lennie and looks after him altohugh it sounds like he doesnt like him he cares for him and still takes care of him even though he gets him in to trouble.The setting is an old ranch in the early 1900s. It takes place in over a1 month period.When lennie and george have to run away to a new ranch because lennie grabed a girl and got scared and she yelled rape. Then when they got to the new ranch they met the bosses son Curley. Who starts a beef with lennie right away because hes jelous that he bigger than him. We kinda liked the book because it had an intresting plot and intresting charecters. I give it 3 stars"
4,Kevin M. and Jonathan D. at Maces Lane Middle School,"The book ""Of Mice and Men"" is about two men trying to survive in the great depression. One of the characters, Lennie, is a mentally retarded person that cant remember anything and likes to pet things. The other man, George, is a smart guy that is burdened with taking care of Lennie. These people are trying to make money to live on a farm. They come and work on this ranch where they meet many surprising people. This stories themes are dreams because Geaorge and Lennie dream about living on a farm and other dreams. Another theme is violence because it tells about some violence in the book. This also shows how life was in the great depression."
4,Tay McW--- KeL MiL...Mice and Men,"Mice and Men is a violent and dramatic novel. The two main characters were Lennie and George. Lennie was a big, kind of ""slow"", quite retarted man and George was smaller and smart. One theme of this book was loneliness. Curly's wife would always come to the bunk house to talk to someone and be with someone because Curly was never there. Another theme of the book was about dreams. Lennie and George dreamed of living on a farm with cows, chickens and rabbits. Conflicts occured many times in this story. Lennie killed birds, mice and even a person. He never meant to do the things he did it was all out of curiosity of feeling on soft things. One more conflict of the story is when Curly doesn't like big people because he's small. Curly took Lennie the wrong way and causesd them to fight. Therefore, this book was interesting and exciting."
5,A tale of two men,Time after time steinbeck has been able to tell a story and capture my attention with great words which flow off the pages. Mice and men is a great story of two men and their lot in life. You'll laugh and cry as you read this tale. And it will challenge you to ask questions you never though were there to ask.
5,Review of;of Mice and men!,"This is a tragic story about two friends that travel together. There friendship is unique. These two frineds, Lennie and George make a very good team together. Lennie is a very big and strong person and is very slow but George is much smaller guy with the brains. It talks about their life in farming and how they travel together to make there dream come true until it takes a twisting turn."
3,We are doing a summary of Of Mice And Men.,Of Mice And Men is a very good book. It has so many different characters and a surprising ending.
2,Don't read this book unless you're forced to!,"Jeez, was this book strange! By looking at all these great reviews, I felt I had to add my opinion. Steinbeck's a talented writer, that's obvious from the first page. But it had no plot or anything.I guess you either love it or hate it."
2,The conclusion should have been happy instead of terrible.,John Steinbeck uses too many cuss words in this book. I think George should have watched Lennie more so he wouldn't get into so much trouble all of the time. This book isn't really worth reading if you have a choice. It's too short and the conclusion doesn't make much sense.
2,Is There A Plot Here?!,"I had to read this book for my English class at school and I started out with an optimistic attitude reflecting this book. The beginning of the book was rather slow but, of course, I had to read it and was willing to give it a chance on account of it being such an essential classic. As I read further, though, I feel that the book could have develloped further than it did. What had been a trace of a plot at the beginning of the book had all but shrunken into a totally unnecessary conclusion that, I feel, had no thought or reflection on the main goal of the book."
3,A Long Journey,"Of Mice and Men is the story of two men working together. The first man, Lennie, was really tall with big hands and feet, but he is off in the head. The second man, George, was short and kinda of grouch; he was the more intelligent one. The two men stay togeher because when Lennie's Auntie died George promed to take care of him. Lennis is always getting into trouble for petting things and killng them. One day they got ran out of town and from there on they are always on the move. I really like the novel but I don't think in should of ended like it did. Lennie was my favorite charachter because he kept me laughing. I would recommnd this novel for people who like adventure. I would give this book three stars because it is pretty good."
5,It was a very riviting book. I could not put it down.,I loved of Mice and Men. The relationship between George and Lennie has a very special meaning. The twists and turns of the story kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down.
4,Of mice and men,"In ""Of mice and men"" there are two main characters .George , the small and smart one. And Lennie the big, strong and dumb one. These two lifelong friends travel around looking for work.They both just lost their jobs because of Lennie's bad behavior. Now, they have got new jobs and George are vigorously trying to keep Lenny out of trouble .Lennie does not get into trouble intentionally , but he is so retarded that he doesnt understand much , this leads to a number of incidents .The story of the book is good because it has many unexpected twists and turns.Especially @ the end when George does what he do . Recommended to people who like reading short novels and generally like good books ."
4,A+ story telling,"Of Mice and Men is an incredible story from then american south west. It tells the story of George Milton and Lennie Small' two travelers looking for work on ranches.George is ""small and quick and dark of face"" while Lennie is big and bulky. George is the more dominant person because he is the smarter person. Lennie needs George because he is mentally handicap. They both have the same goal: to own a small peice of land and live of the fat of the land. They make some friends while making some enemies. The story has a gripping climax and will keep you reading. Two thumbs way up!"
1,ugh,"This book is dull, and I do not know why people like to read it and then to make it into a MOVIE and a PLAY. Boring writing, mild characters, slow almost motionless plot."
1,Ick,"I was forced to read this poor excuse for a book for English class. It was awful. I hope Steinbeck's other books are better than this. This book read like a hazy dream more than a novel, and a BORING & UNCLEAR hazy dream at that. I hope this review convinced you to spend your time on worthwile literature as opposed to this."
1,All they do is swear every other word!,"If your looking for book that gets a little dirty, but reveals a true part of history, you've found what your looking for in John Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men/"""
1,I don't recommend this book.,"This Book tells a story about two friends who are looking for a new job near the Salinas River in California. Lenny, who is mentally retarded, and George, the smart one. They had to escape from their last job because Lenny got in trouble. In the new job the story will be repeated, but this time for the last time. The only reason I gave this book a star is because is has a good plot, and because this is happening in the world right now, it is a reality. The main factor that called my attention was the vocabulary and quotations of the characters. This is why I give one star to the book."
2,The Forgottens And Lonely People,"John Steinbeck who is the author of this book ""Of Mice And Man"",wrote about the forgotten people like the lonely migrant workers.Lennie and George are two migrant worker with different personalities. Lennie is a huge man with an ironic mind, he all the time gets in trouble accidently,George is a small man,but has a quick mind. These two left Weed to Soledad where they attemped to realize their dreams which is to get their own land and have a good life, not to spend their money at a cat house. Since they are not lonely like the other migrant workers. Lennie and George have each others.This book is wonderful and at the same time sad.I recommand this book because it exlains the value of friendship ,how the migrant workers are lonely,how they live and what their dreams are.In this book i love the innocent Lennie as well as George who did his best to protect his only and best friend."
3,A Negative Downfall,"As an assignment to my 11th grade American Literature class, one of the requirements has been to read Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck. I found this novel to be strange and extremely obnoxious. One is introduced to two characters, George and Lennie, right off the bat. As a reader I found myself placing my body and mind into the characters positions. You easily fall in love with the relationship between the two of them. George has this dream and a life that he is able to incorperate Lennie into. Lennie is a sweat, compassionate man with a mental disability. This novel sets you up for Lennie's repeated downfall. Therefore, I find myself to be disgusted with the book."
4,Nice Book,Its a sad but very good book I think it was writen well. I am yet a middle schooler and like this book you might as well read it now and read it again in high school any way good book.
5,I don't think you should be able to read this until you're 30!,I am so very glad that I read this book as an adult for the first time (and had no real idea what it was even about). I read it in one sitting - it is only short and the language is very easy. That is not the challenge of this book!Under an hour to read and oh my god - the ending still makes me gasp...But it is a book that you could probably only read with the intense emotion once and that time should not be wasted on a 17 year old! Once you know the ending it will stay with you forever.This book it a masterpiece.
4,Review of Of Mice and Men,"Of Mice and Men is an amazing tale of two men on a voyage to live big! George is a man of low tolerance, and is traveling with the slow, but warm-hearted, Lenny. I think the book was a well written story of how you can't take advantage of anyone, especially if they don't know that you are doing it. Also, that you can't be too hard on a person who doesn't understand, because then they never will. I think it was a good book because it provided many lessons that included those ones. John Steinbeck introduced, and protrayed the characters in a manner that was very intriguing and realistic. The way he showed Lenny to not be prejudice against Crooks because he didn't see the difference in them privded a good connection with how real people should act. All around Of Mice and Men was a very good book and I would recommend it because it can change the way you think about certain people."
2,ELI THE KING,"I thought that this book was a good book. It was very interesting.I also thought that it had to much swearing in it.sincerely, The King Eli"
3,file review,"This is a lovely, innocuous little ebook.it takes up hardly any space in my readers memory and it seems to perform just as well as ebooks of much more modern titles. Amazing thet they could foresee the technology from way back then but there you go"
2,J.Mills,This book was an alright book. It starts out with Lennie and George in a town called Weed. Then Lennie's obsession with soft things gets them in trouble. They go to another ranch where they meet a few people. Then Lennie gets them in trouble with these new characters. I didn't like this book that much because I don't like to read and it was a boring book. I would only recomened this book to people who like boring books and people 13 years of age and older.
2,Disappointment,This book is not exactly to my liking. It could of been more interesting. It was only was in depth for certain topics. The main reason why I read the book was for the way it showed how even the most of different people can become the best of friends. George the main character Is Lenny's(the second main character)proctector. Lenny is not a person who can defend himself George looks out for him. One more reason why I read the book is because it shows how real friends protect each other and stand by each other in all circumstances no matter the obstacles. by TJones
3,A story about loyaltie trust and the american dream,This story is one of the best ive seen of recent times.John steinback done well in this book by providing many parrallels and making refrences to lennys animal / child like features and behavour.Perhaps the best parralel in the book is beetween candys dog and lenny.
2,Not the Best,"I picked up this book for English class and after reading it I can respect how many people really enjoyed this book and I can see why. It is written well and it does keep your interest. John Steinbeck's style is very unique and it is semi-enjoyable to read (although every other sentence contains a swear word.)The story is about two men, George and Lennie, who always look out for each other. Lennie is, well, ""different"" in that he loves to touch soft things. He has the mind of a two year old. George does his best efforts to look after Lennie, although Lennie does get into a lot of trouble. After being chased away from their previous town, George and Lennie get new jobs in hopes to someday own a ranch of their own.Though this book was written well and the plot was good, I didn't like the story line. It was very depressing and was annoying for me to read. Maybe I'm just one person in a million who didn't enjoy this book. Try it out and see what you think."
4,Pretty Good....I've seen better DLC MLMS,"The book Of Mice And Men by: John Steinbeck was a pretty good book, not the best i have seen but pretty good. In the story there are two hobo's named Lennie(retarted) and George(sane). They have a dream of living off the fat of the land. They go arould the country looking for jobs to get a little bit of money for some support. They end up at a ranch working with alot of guys their age and enjoying the stay, but not for long. Lennie has been getting george in trouble all of his life, and now was not any different. In the end Lennie kills Curly's wife and George has to kill him. In the end, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head, with Carlson's gun. I would recomend this book to everyone who likes funny, but depressing books, John Steinbeck is a very good writer."
3,CHRIS FOX AND COLLIN G MLMS,"This book wasn't bad. The only problem that we had with it was that the literature was hard to understand. The characters in the book however, were funny and entertaining. George and Lennie ane two best friends during the early 30's. George is a smart character who could live well on his own but decided to stay with his best friend Lennie. Lennie is a "" mentally challenged"" man who is very strong. In this story there are 2 main themes. These themes reflect loneliness and dreams. George and Lennie are very lonely and they dream of having a farm with lots of animals. The main conflicts of the story are Lennie's mistakes and trying to adapt to another character Curly. Neither one of these conflicts are resolved. george helps Lennie adapt to his life but during the story he still encounters conflict. Lennie eventually causes so much trouble that it may be too much for George to take. Overall, we liked the story line and the humor in this book."
3,It's the friend whom cares!,My thoughts are this book can be less foul language also even readers whom to like this book not to get much facts down in your mind. I would have to say age group 15yrs.and older because it's words may be hard for some people so that's what I recommend. Mostly this book was okay for me that I know of.
4,Of Mice And Men,The story oif Mice and Men is a good book because there is never really a dull moment. I expected the book to be about mice. I later found out it was really about. This book was about two lowlife farmers who are trying to get their own stake. George is the brighter one who is in charge of the operation. So the book takes place in a rural area in California. I t is a fiction book. It's a rally good book so you should check it out.
4,"A sweaty palm, edge of your seat kind of book. : )",George and Lennie are two guys who are travailing and looking to earn enough money to buy some land.They get to work on a ranch and meet an old man named Candy and a young man named Slim. Then the bosses son Curly starts some truble becouse he is smaller than Lenny so he is mad. It is all taking place in a dry and dusty and hot time. So it will make you sweat to read this book. it is a good book for the more mature audiences due to the language.But it is a great book! check it out at your local library today.
5,This is a good book for anyone old enough for the content,"I liked this book, Of Mice and Men, more than any book I've read in a while. This book was a fast paced easy to understand book that was great for a person like me who doesn't like books all that much. It was a great plot that didn't make me want to go to sleep and had a very unexpected ending that left you with plenty to think about after it was all said and done. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes to read or hates to read, I don't think that it matters. Anyway fantastic book!"
4,It was a very moving book,We had to read this book in English class and I really liked it.It was touching and it made me cry. I really liked Lennie
4,Good but depressing.,"In a world where everyone is on prozac, high school's decide to include such tragic books as Steinbeck's Of Mice And Men in our curriculum. People don't really have a right to complain about the youth of America's obbsession with death when they are the one's causing it."
4,The book was O.K. I sort of liked it,I thought the book was o.k. but it didn't really make any sense. The chaacters were all strange and they had no real part of the book except to revole around Lennie and George. But I think people should read it to find out abou how things were in that time.
4,Tough and Touching,"The wonderful narrative style that Steinbeck uses here helps to make the book even more brutal and touching. Unlike others, I feel that this book is not too short. In its brevity, Steinbeck has still effectively portrayed the difficulties of the life of ranch hands in the 1930s.The special relationship that Lennie and George share is especially heartwarming, and is the focal point of our compassion. Lennie's childlike innocence is also enduring and when we see how he has unknowingly killed Curly's wife, we cannot help but feel that George's decision to kill him instead of letting him face the wrath of the mob is the right one. That way he will still die preserving his innocence.All in all a deeply moving novel that is both heartwarming yet tough and brutal, like the life of a ranch hand."
4,Pretty good book :),"I think that this book was one of Steinbeck's better books. But I think that Lennie's character is too childish and stupid. Also, I think that George is pretty cool, but sometimes too over demanding and bossy, to Lennie. For the most part though, I thought it was a good book. I would recommend it to someone who has a special younger or older friend in their life. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it an 8.5. This book is not recommended for those that are overly sensitive people (see ending). Hope you enjoy the book; try chekcing out some of Steinbeck's other works. Enjoy, and happy reading!"
3,Jam is Poo on Mice & Men,"I read this book at school and to begin with I found it rather boring. Although later on, I found it extermely exciting and quite sad aswell. Some of the language was hard to understand and I only recommened this book to a more mature reader. I think the characters are realy interesting and remind me about real people. If you are confident, when it comes to reading, this is a fantastic book."
5,Great Character Sketch,What is great about this novel is it's simple plot yet complex psychological interplay of the characters who affect each other like a woven mesh. All of them have good intentions but tragedy was inescapable. Real life stuff. Great read.
4,Awesome tale of two farming men.,"George Milton and Lennie Small are two on the road workers. Barely surviving off of less than minimum wage, they have a dream of owning their own farming ranch. Lennie being retarded, is protected by George, making them continuous ""farm buddies"". Then one day Lennie gets scared of a girl trying to seduce him, and accidentally kills her. Lennie runs away with a search party after him. Written by John Steinbeck in 1937 it is widely honored around the country!"
4,I think this book was well written.,"Steinbeck tells a spectacular story about two men. One is George Milton, the other is Lennie Small. I will not tell you everything that happens, but it is worth reading. I like the foreshadowing he used with Old Candy's dog (you will have to read the book to understand)."
1,Of Mice and Men,"Of Mice and MenOf Mice and Men was a good book, I recommend it to anyone who likes a good short book. It's full of fun and adventure. But it had its ups and downs. It is not a bad book, I think that I would read it again, but not for a while, I would like to watch the movie first so I can compare if it is even close to how the book goes. I only like one character and that's Lennie, he is very funny at some points, and sad at other points in the book. Over all it was a good book to read if you like to read books."
1,Of Mice and Men,"Three crucial pages were torn from the book: The ""Introduction by Susan Shillinglaw""(Director of the Steinbeck Research Center); ""Suggestions for Further Reading""; and ""A Note on the Text."" Since I was reading the book for a class discussion, these items would have aided me greatly during the discussion period."
1,of mice and men,I read of mice and men because I had to for school otherwise I would have never read this book I thought it was going to be boring and nothing changed it was still boring. The story is about lenny and george and they travel around from job to job trying to make money. Lenny likes to touch things and always gets them kicked out of ever town they go to. Then they have a plan to get their own land and stop working for everyone else. This was a boring book. It was written by John Steinbeck.
1,AHHHH!!!!!!,"I had to read this book for my 9th grade English class and i must say this is the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life! it had the worst ending possible, I had to keep putting it down because it had the slowest plot in the world and had very flat characters. (Amazon suggests you buy this with To kill a Mockingbird which was the other book that was required for me and I highly suggest that book because it is a great book and one of my all time favorites.) AHHHHH!!!!! this book made me soo mad. They killed of my favorite character!!! and george did it how could he do that! Slim was my other favorite and so was candy but even Slim wasn't cool in the end. I hated this book so much. Don't read this its bad. Read to Kill a Mocking Bird its good. If you want to read something of John Steinbecks read the Grapes of Wrath."
2,"George, Lenny, and some dead mice.","This book was required reading in high school, and we all made fun of it. I guess it's an O.K. book but I don't recall it having much of an impact other than humor value. But I'm not a big Steinbeck fan. I guess we all have our prejudices."
2,Eli's the king,I think that this book was very weak.There should of been more killing.I also think that lennie did the right thing by killing the girl at the end.The book wasn't very good.To much swearing.
2,Of mice and men,"What confuses me more than why I was forced to read this book in school was how anyone could call it a masterpiece or a classic for that matter. I'll admit the relationship between Lennie( mentally retarded) and George was sweet. Although as the book so uneventfully progressed, things turned terrible between Lennie accidentally killing Curley's wife and George shooting Lennie. As in both The Pearl and Of Mice and Men, Steinbeck seems to love writing about innocent people getting shot. Steinbeck is a pessimist to say the least and I will never read his works again."
5,Beautifully written book,"This is a very beautifully written book. It's the first Steinbeck book I've ever read, I started yesterday night and just couldn't put it down until I had read it. The words are vividly descriptive and the characters almost come alive in your mind. Steinbeck sort of fades in and out of scenes by describing what is happening in the surroundings, making it a very pleasant experienced to read this book. He picks you up gently in the start of a chapter and puts you down just as gently in the end.The plot is brilliant, I love the story about this odd couple travelling together, the dilemma, a story told with a vivid and subtly humorous language.This is absolutely a 5 star book."
5,The book that made me an avid reader,"602 reviews of this book have been written to date, with an average rating of 4.5 stars! What more needs to be said?The story and popularity of this book are of course well known, so I will briefly tell you my Of Mice and Men story:I was in grade eleven (but taking grade ten English), hated school, had loser ""friends"" who I studdornly refused to disassociate with despite the fact that I knew deep down they would ruin me, when we had to do a reading assignment for English class. Not wanting to be bothered by it all, I chose the shortest one that I could find: Of Mice and Men. My teacher tried to get me to read a longer book--why then was Of Mice and Men on the list then???--but I refused. Well, I read the book and loved it, loved it so much that I have been an avid reader ever since."
4,"Of Mice and Men, a book review by me",I thought Of Mice and Men was a good book so thats why i gave it a 4 out of 5 stars. The people in the book were relastic and they seemed like they would be the type of people that lived back in the 1930's. Also how they talked seemed like that would be how they talked back then. In this book there was racisim so that is the social issue in this book..and yea..i don't really have anything else to say but it was a pretty good book.
4,Professional Book Review of the book: Of Mice and Men,"I liked the book alot, for being a required book to read in a junior english class, it wasn't a bad selection. My favorite character is probably, George, cause I mean he stuck with Lennie almost to the very end and he put up with all this problems.The plot of the book is interseting because the time period their really wasn't much to life when your a traveling ranch hand. I like the slick ways of Slim, he's also an interseting character. But, most of all out of the whole book I want a old dog that can't see and can't even walk because their so useful...joke. Good decision to kill that dog it probably was in pain.But the book dispite it's few slow parts I believed it to be an awesome book."
3,"Was very interesting, yet pleasing","I enjoyed this book alot. It was a good plot. I loved the characters George and Lenny, They were very expressive about what they needed to do and say. John Stienbeck did a great job writing this book."
3,"Good, but to short","The book of mice and men was a very good book, but it was not one of the best I have read. It was way to slow-paced and to short. I would recommend it to other kids our age, especially those studying the depression. This book is probably believable for the time frame, but since it is written like a play it can get very confusing in the long dialogue scenes. This book has a lot of great symbolisms but that alone does not make a good book. You would be better of checking this out from a library then buying it."
3,of mice and men,"The book Of mice and men was a really geat book, i read it befor in eighth grade but it meant more and i could understadn it better. The book was put together well , but i didn't like the was it ended Steinbeck could have went into a little more detail of the way George went on without Lennie.i like the was he showed the relationship between Lennie and Geoge, and how george took care of him and how Lenny took care of George. Steinbeck to me had to hve a creative imagination to write such a great creative book."
4,Classic for a reason,"This book is a very brief but moving tale that will leave you thinking. Stienbeck's mastery here is in character development. He creates a cornicopia of characters in a genius way, quick and to the point. Somehow, in such a short amount of time, he creates characters you feel you've known your whole life.The scenery is well built as well, and the story itself is interesting and timeless. It could be set in 2006 just as easily, and still be relevant. It's a very relaxing read, and flows smoothly.You wont want to put this book down, and you'll only be busy about an hour reading it. This book is just as entertaining as I'm sure it was in 1937, and can be called a classic."
5,audio book,I loved this book! It was read by Gary Sinise and I love his voice. It arrived quickly and in the condition I was expecting. I'm very happy with my purchase.
5,When I read this book it showed me how love is so important.,This book is a really good book and I recomend it to kids to read. It is really showing and it really grabs the reader. Overall this book was well written but has a few flaws in it.
4,"a very good book, just some stuff I had problems with","I had to read Of Mice and Men as summer reading for my freshman year in high school. It's a very good book. Overrall, I enjoyed it. There were just some little things I couldn't handle. Because I'm very sensitive, I wasn't comfortable with certain scenes in the book. I had trouble reading those parts and I couldn't understand why it happened that way. John Steinbeck did a good job on this one, on the other hand. It's well-written and interesting, it just has some flaws. I still own the book and I still read it every now and then. But it will never be classified as one of my favorite books. I recommend it for anyone, but if you're like me, and you have trouble reading about violence and troubling scenes, you might want to hold off for awhile. I don't want anyone to miss out on a book like this, but I don't want anyone to become upset over it, either."
3,"Good, but not the masterpiece I was hoping for","This is the only Steinbeck I have read to date (except for The Pearl) and I started it expecting a masterpiece, given that Steinbeck was a Nobel laureate. It is certainly a good enough, solid story, reasonably well told, but no masterpiece. Maybe it's just that the plot element of a person killing another he loves as an act of compassion has been used too often since (e.g. Betty Blue and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest).So read the book, by all means, but don't harbour the expectations I had. It's a short little book, not complex at all, so it won't be hard work even if you don't like it all that much."
4,Great book,"The book show the real life of two men. One who are crazy and another who try to survive and helped his crazy friend. It show's the real world of our times, but in another century."
3,Not to my expectations,"Classical short American book, The story develops in the California State ranches during hard economic times where migrant workers long to attain the American Dream having not a cent in their pockets, The development of the main characters, George a wise migrant worker and Lenny a mentally disabled fellow at his care is rather good as well as the depictions of the settings around the town of Soledad in Central California which surpasses the quality of the plot which was all the way fitted to suit a climax in the tragic ending from whose I could not grasp its underlying message. Friendship, the American Dream, Justice, and racism are all element and values that have shaped the American nation to the current time and are subtly touched in this book as a part of the scene where the action takes place"
5,A True Classic,"One of my all-time favorite books. Appropriate for maybe thirteen years and older. But don't at all think this is a book intended for teens, it's got some adult themes and has a crazy ending worth reading."
3,"Thanks for sending ""Of Mice and Men""...","The book was shipped very quickly, and I appreciate that so much. This was required reading for my daughter, who is a freshman in high school. I also appreciated the fact that it was much more economical, than purchasing a new copy. The book was a little rough, as far as appearance goes, but it is definitely usable! Thank you!"
1,dont read this book!,"My english teacher read this book outloud to us. It was the worst thing ever. I feel asleep every day he read it because it was so boring! It seemed like it took forever to finish so dont read this book unless you want somthing really, really boring!"
1,Over-rated,This book is kinda over-rated - it's by Steinbeck 'n everything but I couldn't read past the 20th page.
1,"If you like John Steinbeck, you are insane, please seak help","This book was quite possibly the worst book i've ever had to read. No wait, the worst ever was The Pearl! What is wrong with Steinbeck? Why does he feel he needs to kill main characters? I would seriously recomend that you never read this book ever. If you have to for highschool, I feel extremely sorry for you. In cnclusion I just have to say George, just let Lennie tend the Frickin' rabbits and Kino, throw the pearl away already!"
5,I loved this book.,"I read it in the 9th grade which was about two or three years ago. I loved it. I thought it very well written. I love George and Lennie. I love George's hate/love relationship with Lennie, and how he takes care of him and look out for him even though Lennie gets him into a lot of trouble. I loved the ending and how Lennie was thinking of the farm that George and him have dreamed about. I cried at the end of the story it was so amazing yet terribly sad. You really connect with how the characters feel at or by the end of the novel.thank you for your time,Loran"
5,Beautifully read . . .,For those who have never read Of Mice and Men AND for those who have - this is an exquisitely read version of Steinbeck's classic tale.
5,Reluctant readers will read it...,"Having taught at an inner city school with extremely reluctant readers, I always found joy in witnessing kids get into this book. I have had students confess they had never before read a ""chapter"" book, but they actually read this one.Steinbeck's characteriztion, his timeless themes, and his crafty step into a deeper world of symbolism and realism reach to students...I highly recommend reading it with the audio tapes as well. Gary Sinise does an outstanding read...There simply is no better George."
2,mlms.peteyboy/ps,"""Of mice and men"" is not a very fun book to read it has very bad racial and verbal langauge. for a book to do a report on it would be a very good selection it definitly shows the characters piont of views by explaining thier body language as you read so you can imagine how they feel. it gives importance of characters by putting them in situations that require them to take action.It is mostly a very good book with very interesting characters."
2,HORRIABLE,We read this book and my entire class disliked this book even though it's a classic i think i was wayyyy to young to enjoy this book as many other people did
2,Bad Ending,"I hated the ending of the book, it was awful and depressing. I thought it was going to turn out better!"
4,It's Wierd,"This book is wierd because in the end the main character shoots his mentally challenged frined in the back of the head, and hes tellin him a story abot his happiness"
1,"If you didn't like the pearl,you won't like this one","Of Mice and Men had a good begining and a good plot. It would have been a better book if Steinbeck had made it longer and put more effort into it. When you read his books you get the feeling that he started out with this great idea, and then got bored so he just finished the book real quick."
1,of mice and men,"this book may be easy to study for english literature, being short. However, this story is not interesting in the least, with a plot that builds up and then is thrown away totally at the end."
5,A wonderful Tale!,This book is a tragic tale of two farm laborers who wander around to own a land of their own. They both are an unlikely pair. George is a short and smart man. Lennie is an enormous man with a childish mind. They both are very different yet they have formed a family. They ran away from their hometown to escape the law and started to work on a ranch in the Salians valley but trouble awaits them every corner. This is a great book for the ages of thirteen or over. If you love adventure and fun then you should read this book!
3,"Jade kenny , Student from MLMS","The Book ""Of Mice and Men"" was overall a delightful read. It was about two men Named Lennie and George, who are searching for there dream. Lennie is a very tall guy who doesnt know his own strenght. He is kinda slow and retarded but he has a good soul! Then there is George who is bossy at times but wants the best for Lennie. Throughout the book Lennie gets him and George in alot of trouble so they are always on the run! The end is very shocking so i wont tell you what happens. You will have to read it and find out for yourself!I recomend this book to teenagers who have a dream about living the good life and People who love a thrill in the end!"
5,SWEET DREAMS,"Lennie is big with a mind of a kid and George is a good person,always is taking care of lennie, he is small and black.They have a big dream.This book talk abaut lonliness, love,friendship,discrimination,alienation,disappointment,death,and dreams.It is a good book,i like it because i learned abaut the dreams, something tha everybody has, but some of they came true. I recommend this book because a lot of people have learned somrthing from this book and it is easy to understand the life of the migrant workers.Read it."
4,You must read this book!,"Of Mice and Men by John Steinback is a great book to read.It is a book about how George, a small quick guy helps Lennie, a big guy, who is not very smart.Through the story George always helps Lennie.This book makes you want to keep on reading to find out what happens.My favorite part about Of Mice and Men is that it has a sad ending.It's not one of those boring story's where it has a happy endind.This book is more unique."
5,An unbelievable work of art!,"Of Mice and Men is truely one of Steinbeck's most well-written and moving novels. The story is a simple one, with a few others branching off of it. The main plot consists of a smart, young, productive man taking care of a friend who is extremely strong, large, and partially slow. It is a tear-jerking story that I feel everyone should read. If you end up liking this, the movie with Gary Sinise is just as good, if not better! A must read!I conclude with only one negative comment. If you are sensitive about profanity in books, I suggest you not read this. It is packed to the brim... Compared to the book, though, the movie is profanely mild, in fact. A surprising move for Hollywood."
4,"My review for ""Of Mice and Men"".","I strongly advise everyone to read ""Of Mice and Men"" by John Steinbeck. This is one of the best books I've ever read. It has everything from comedy to drama. This is one of those must-read books. Here's a little review of the book. There are two main characters in this book named Lennie and George. These two men are best friends who travel together wherever they go. The story starts off when Lennie and George have to run away from their job in a town called Weed. They travel to a new job on a ranch where many things happen. At first the story doesn't seem too interesting, but you have to read to the end for the very best part. And trust me, it's worth it. I won't give it away, but the ending will definitely make you quite emotional."
4,Of Mice And Men,"The story is about two guys who go to a ranch to find jobs. George is a small guy who is smart. Lennie is a big guy who is very slow. Lennie gets in lots of trouble with wanting to pet soft things like mice and velvet. When they get the job Lennie gets in lots of trouble with other workers at the ranch. There is a girl on the ranch, which gets Lennie in lots of trouble at the end of the story. I think it is a good book to read."
5,"Powerful, wonderful","Never required to read this book in school. Now, in my mid 50's have finally read it. It is superb. Great character studies. A short book, but one I will never forget. Makes me hungry for more Steinbeck. Is densely packed with incredibly colorful descriptions, yet still leaves room for one's imagination to fill in some details. Probably can appreciate more now than would have in high school. Steinbeck was a genius."
4,of mice and men,very pleased with the service and a great book. i had to read it for english many years ago and I fell in love with the story.
2,Suitable only for Steibeck's fans,"In this classic novel, John Steibeck tells the story of two friends in 1930s California. George and Lennie are Itinerant farm workers.They work for making their dream come true, having a farm of their own with animals, etc.The story develops in a farm, where we know many characters, all of them, have dreams.The main theme on the story is dream, But also violence and loneliness are important. All of the characters, are, in extreme situations, where the only salvation is work, and dream. I did not like so much the book,I find it a bit dense, but the story, theme, and how the story is tell, makes the book, a good book, only suitable for Steinbeck's fans."
3,"Ok, once someone explained the meaning to me","I don't see the reason for the ending, but the plot and the setting were pretty good"
2,"Ramone and Teaira MLMS,CAMBRIDGE,MD","The book ""Of Mice and Men"" was a good book because it shows how someone could take care of another person that isn't very intelligent. It shows how someone could not be smart but still work hard. I liked this book because it showed how someone could committ a crime but for a good cause. I would recommend this book for soft-hearted people. Ramone P.The book ""Of Mice and Men"" didn't really interest me because in a way the title didn't really fit the story. Also, the point of the story was not clear. The title didn't fit the story because the whole book wasn't about mice and men. The only thing in the book about mice was when Lennie kept picking up mice and having them as pets. This book kind of interested me on behalf of Lennie because he wasn't very intelligent; he was retarted. I recommend this book to any one who is in depth with retarted people. Teaira T."
2,"The review of book ""of Mice and Men""","This story took place in the Salmos Valley,Californiain a small town called Weed,during the great Depression.Lennie and George were like son and father.Lennie had a mind of a child and George was like his father who always took care of him.Lennie always gave troubles to George,but George understood him because he knew Lennie didn't know what he was doing .Curley was the boss'son.curley's wife gave big problem to Lennie.George did something to Lennie,he didn't want to do it,and Lennie also didn't think that he could do something like that to him."
4,Exceedingly thought provoking,This novel surpassed all my expectations. It was assigned as summer reading and I'm so happy that it was. This is not a story with direct characterization that tells you everthing right away but a story of characters without names and forshadowing. This book can lead to a discussion for hours. It will make you reconsider your values and judgements.
4,Good book,"It was a short and interesting story, not complicated and easy to read. You would like it too. I recommendIt."
5,Great,"What more do you want? its a simple paper back book, looks good, decent enough cover, what else? its a book"
3,Recomendation,"Of Mice and men is a book that I first raed for literature at as an obligation, but after I've gone through the first part with a ""long"" description of the setting, I really started to enjoy it. When you go through the story, John Steinbeck applies his unique tecnique to descrive the characters in a very vivid way, basing the story on a couple of intinerant workers, one of them mentallty retarded, fact that was going to kill him in a near future. The story touches as main themes, reflected in mostly all characters; desolation, discrimination, dreams in common, lonliness and violence (in various aspects). As a matter of fact, this makes a very moving story that can be enjoy by young people such as adults."
4,"I will pet him, and stroke him, and squeeze him...","This is an easy classic to knock off the list in two hours. Like many people I saw the movie first, though a good 15 years prior. I'll admit John Malkovich popped in my head many times, but I was able to form my own images also. It's amazing how even a simple and short story can can draw you in so deeply. It was easy to smell the country air, and visualize the ranch. I suspect this book is disliked by some, and removed from a few libraries because the ""N"" word is dropped many times. But hey, that's a sign of the times. Great book overall. Quite moving at the end."
4,Of Mice And Men,"I like Of Mice And Men by John Steinbeck because the definition of the characters was so realistic. I also liked the fact that it was in the novella form so the possibility that the story might drag did not happen.I would recommend Of Mice And Men not only to afficionados of Steinbeck, but to virtually anyone who enjoys real-life prose."
3,EPISODE 1: The Lennie Menace,"The book is about two guys, George and Lennie, traveling through California to get a job on a farm. Their plan is only prevented by Lennie's mentally retardation, which runs them into a lot of trouble.This book differs from other books, read in class, not only by the colloquial English, but also by the story in itself.Most of all I like the way Lennie is described in the book although there are certain passages in which the description becomes untrustworthy. Some of his statements don't fit to his behavior and the other way around. In my view the ending is not chosen very well. There must be other, better possibilities for them, except .... !All in all it is an interesting and entertaining book, which gives you the opportunity, among the entertainment, to gain more information about the social circumstances during the time of the depression in the United States."
3,Ms. Farvour's B 4/5 Language Arts Class,"Overall, I give this book 3 stars. The recreation of the 1930's in this story, gave me an idea of what it must have been like back than, with the men traveling around going from job to job and how the men would make some money and blow it off at the bars. Steinbeck showed the friction between the whites and blacks. Slavery was, and sometimes is now, a very big issue.Steinbeck described each character in a unique way. He made every character with different personality, individuality, and unique characteristics.This novel is a good book for young adults, I suppose, because this teaches us a new way of reading. We don't just read the book and discuss it, the book makes us read between the lines. The book aslo extends our vocabulary, which comes of good use."
5,A good book of a strong friendship.,"I think the book ""Of Mice and Men"" was a really good book. It is one of my favorites. I like it because it emphasizes the great friendship of these two guys that are trying to make a livng after the depression when money wasn't worth much. I thought it was interesting how John Steinbeck chose to have the setting of this story in Salinas and that's where he was born. I think George is a strong character and his good qualities are useful in my years to come."
3,I thought that this book was good but it needs more detail.,Overall I thought that this book was good. Although I did think that it needed to go into more detail about the characters and their actions. I also thought that this book taught a good lesson about friendship. I didn't like this book because first of all I thought that it was too short and that the book moved too fast and didn't embellish enough on the past and present events that had occurred in the book. Overall I thought that it was a good book.
4,This book will appeal to anyone who likes a little adventure,"I would definitely recommend this book to anyone , espeacialy people who love books with traveling and books with a little violence involved in it. It can be a little confusing at first but when you start getting into it, it is a fantastic book!"
3,Of Mice and Men,I like the story Of Mice and Men. The story starts out in a field of weed. They get kicked out of weed cause of Lennie (a big strong working man that is slow) he touched a girl with a red dress. George is a guy that is short and takes care of Lennie. Lennie is a guy that likes to pet dead rats. George gets Lennie out of trouble or else he would probably be dead.
5,"""Of Mice and Men""","The story, Of Mice & Men was a laid back but humorous. I thought it was a great book. The characters all were individual. They all had their own distinct personalities. Lennie was my favorite character. He was a big guy that wasn't to bright. Actually I felt bad for him. I also felt bad for the mice he killed. Well the story is mostly about two guys working on a ranch, but dream of having a place of their own. Lennie who was strong but had a mind of his own, wanted rabbits. He couldn't get off the subject bout those rabbits. I really liked the book but the one thing I didn't like was how it ended. I was hoping that they would get Lennie's dream about having a place of their own and livin off the fat of the lan."
3,THE REPORT,"My reportTravelling across America in search of who are now they do it on cycles, in cars, by bus or in time honored tradition of foot and thumb. The wanderers of today may wear the long and speak a different jargon, but their trip is one that men and woman have taken for as long as this country has been pushing at its frontier."
4,Read this book!,"Great book about a friendship between two men. It's worth reading. The only thing that could have been changed was the development of the characters. Don't read a lot of the reveiws because some of the readers thought they should tell the entire story including the ending,"
5,"One of, if not , THE best book i've ever read!","Of Mice And Men is one of my alltime favorite books. It is so thought provocking, and is a book that should be read by every one. So If You haven't read this book, do yourself a favor, and read it!"
3,what I thought about Of Mice and Men,"I think the story is action packed. Where Lennie killed his puppy and Curley's wife, George killed Lennie, and Carlson killed Candy's dog. All that made me excited. I didn't really like the part where George killed Lennie. They could have run off to a different state or something. Above all I think the story was great."
2,Not that Great,"If you have any experience with Affiliate programs and/or online marketing, this book was really irrelevant for learning anything new. It's a good introductory book, but that's about the extent of what its good for."
3,"Not bad, Needs more songs.","Squirts EP, Go!, is pretty cool but it definetly needs more songs. This CD is rather boring without more NEW songs on it. Squirt, make some new songs!"
1,"Scratches, chips easily!","Bought this seat at Home Depot about 6 months ago. Love the style but unfortunately the seat became chipped. Tried to ""paint"" the chips, but to no avail. It looked horrible. After purchasing a few wood toilet seats by Bemis and having them each chip easily -- I'll now try a plastic seat."
3,Paint scratches off surface,"The matt paint white top coat of paint scratches/chips off where you open/close the lid.The chrome hinges become calcified very quickly & no cleaners can remove this, so it looks awful.Put up with it for 3 years & now I'm going to replace the entire thing."
1,Seat lasted less than 1 month- Bemis won't replace!,"We purchased this from HD, lasted about 4 weeks. Bemis won't replace- told us to buy a new one! Terrible customer service! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!"
1,Movie Only Good for Nap Time,"This is a real yawn fest. After the main character walks in front of her place of work for the 100th time and says the same ""catch phrases"" a 1,000 times, my eyelids could not control themselves any longer. The DVD extras weren't much better. There was a makeshift documentary about Morrissey fans and commentary from people involved with the film. I don't even know what they did or who they were but the makeup artist sticks clearly in my mind. I don't think the main characters were even in the room for this ""special feature."" Boring and Lame."
2,Lukewarm at Best,"I saw this in a little theatre in Manhattan, hoping for a more polished, Morrissey-rich experience, but this was a pretty sub-par affair- and frankly it's annoying to see a film this poor with even decent distribution. Terrible camerawork and spotty acting over-all. Bad editing and annoying Cali pop-punk soundtrack, only saved by the presence of Quasi. I was really disappointed- when people put such little effort and inspiration into something, and they get support, one less person with a real vision gets heard. It was occasionally worth a laugh, but overall I found myself angry at the Gods for opening up the Pandora's box of indie films without keeping the hacks out. We have enough of those in Hollywood."
5,the BESTEST FILM EVERRRRR!!!!!!!,this is an absolute MUST SEE for both the morrissey-obsessed and morrissey-hater... Jackie Buscarino and Eduardo Acosta are hillarious!!!!!!!!! i think i could watch this movie 100 times over.
1,The WORST movie I have ever seen,"I saw this movie in the theater about 4 weeks ago. It, by far, has to be the worst movie I've ever seen.The acting is bad.The plot is thin. (Hello!?! A lesbian rape scene?)It serves as the perfect ""How to stalk Morrissey Guide.""I suppose this film was supposed to be a farce. It fails miserably. I laughed at places where there was supposed to be no laughter. I just couldn't help thinking that Morrissey would absolutely cringe upon seeing this film.I think it's great that Morrissey fans are going out and creating art, but this film misses the mark.Props to Jose M, who stars as Morrissey. He always looks good."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This is the most painful 85 minutes that you will ever sit through. The movie sucks. Nothing about it is funny, just stupid. I think I could make a better movie with my camera phone. stupid."
1,TOTAL PIECE OF TRASH! JUST SAY NO!,"I would like to give this movie no stars but it was not an option. Don't be fooled by the indie reviews and look of this film. It is HORRIBLE! I'm a huge John Waters fan and enjoy camp and ""bad"" movies. Even John Waters would be bored with this one. The director spent too much time on looooong shots and scenes that go nowhere. Repetitive dialogue from the main character also gets annoying. Too bad! The movie could have had great potential but failed at the hands of an un-creative director."
1,Waste of life.,this movie has not only a horrible story but has NO smiths/morrissey music at all and the guy who plays moz doesnt even look much like him even though they cover his face in shadows. the longer i watched this movie the more i though how much of a waste it is to watch/buy/think about...anything! it sucked! don't buy it. dont even bother seeing it. believe me.
2,I Fell Asleep! Morrissey is NOT in this movie!,"I was completely disappointed in this ""film.""This film was LITERALLY put together by Spongebob Squarepants studio assistants and was a complete waste of my evening. Not funny, not humerous (other than 4 lesbian high-schoolers and the main character's ex-boyfriend who is friggin' hilarious in the few scenes he is in), and nauseatingly slow-paced.I won't go into a long description, but essentially, some girl is totally obsessed with Moz and stops by some of his old haunts in an effort to find and marry him. She is an outcast and made fun of by everyone.The extras are actually more interesting than the movie! Clips of Moz conventions and psycho-fans are pretty funny. The extras actually have a couple of Moz photos/distant video-cam clips.I LOVE Moz but HATE this movie. Please, borrow it, rent it, or steal it but DONT waste your hard-earned cash on it. You will be disappointed. And remember, MOZ IS NOT IN THE MOVIE!!!"
1,Truly Disappointed,"Allow me to summarize this film for you.A self-centered, rude and unlikeable Morrissey fan licks Morrissey posters and basically deludes herself into believing that she is going to marry him.I understand that the film is intended to be funny and over-the-top, but the humor is merely vulgar and mean spirited.Before someone accuses me of simply not like Morrissey or of being a victim of Hollywood formula, let it be known that I am both a huge Smiths/Morrissey fan and an admirer of independent films. Despite these facts, I couldn't bring myself to enjoy any aspect of this film."
3,Wrong Size,One pair is perfect. The other pair is marked 2XL but I can't even get them on they are so tight. Obviously they were marked wrong at the factory. It is really irritating but not much I could do about it since I already threw away the packaging it came in.
5,Absolutely adorable summary of wildlife in the desert!,"This fun book tells ""lyric-like"" tales of some of the main creatures found in the southwestern desert. You can almost hear music when you read it! It's very clever! I highly recommend it for toddlers to second graders. The illustrations are great too. A really cute book!Desert Songwriter/Patty Horn"
3,good sex,"Hustler pushes the envelope and is good porn.They have interesting writing,and always write about interesting currant events.they stay in touch with the times."
4,A most useful tool for the online job hunter!,While there are many books about job finding on the NET. Ms. Smith's book is written for the average person not the net-head. You'll learn how to navigate the net and bring home the information you need to become a successful online candidate!
2,Other books cover more and in more detail.,"There just is nothing new in this book. None of the information is bad, mind you, it just a rehash of similar titles. It never goes beyond the obvious."
4,Too Easy.,"The other two reviewers raved about this, so maybe it's just me, but the title should be ""The most simplistic recipes ever created"". There is actually a recipe for a toasted cheese sandwhich. If you do not already know how to make this, then this book may be too advanced. Pass on this unless you can't come up with a can of soup, chicken & bag of veggies on your own.I give it 4 stars only because it is Betty Crocker and it has great pictures."
5,Nice!,I really like this cookbook. It's not overwhelming. I have already made a recipe and it turned out really good!
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"The kit I received is not the one in the picture, it says it should fit a 99 civic, but does not even come close. The instructions are EXTREMELY vague and do not provide any clarity at all as to what brackets to remove or use. IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT!!! I attempted to contact customer service and i got what sounded like a crappy home answering machine. Now I have a disassembled car with no radio and no way to mount it. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN! Do yourself a favor and find another mounting kit if you have a 99 civic, this is not a mounting kit for a 99 civic. Such a scam."
5,many resources,many of the names are still out there for resources. would prefer a newer edition for assisting client in our area
2,Just so-so,"I ordered these tights, mainly for the price and the well-known brand. I am 5'5'' and about 130 pounds... average woman's height and weight and ordered a medium. They are very long - probably about 2-3 extra inches, which bag up at the ankles. The fit is also quite old-fashioned; high waist-ed. I would buy these if fit and looks are not all that important to you. I also run in colder weather, about 20 degrees in the winter and found they had very little insulation, if any.Overall, I was not pleased with the tight and would have sent them back, if there was not an additional $9 return fee from Roadrunner Sports!"
1,didn't get mine either,I ordered these for a Christmas gift. They were backordered so I got a new ship date. They cancelled the order after the end of the new shipping window. No explanation- just didn't send them. I'd be cautious about ordering from Fogdog.
1,don't order from FogDog -- you won't get it,"I ordered these tights on Dec. 17. I waited, and waited and waited. They were a Christmas gift for my sister. It took a full month -- until Jan. 12 -- for an email from the company. They mysteriously canceled my order. Thanks, guys! Guess there's always next Christmas."
4,NIce collection,"If you're a fan of this band or any of the related bands (Field Mice, Trembling Blue Stars, any Sarah records band) this is definatly a release for you. Most of these b-sides and comp tracks are very rare at this point and tough to track down. The songs that didn't appear on the albums were just as good as the ones that did. Twee as f**k!!!"
5,Fast and fun,"Andy Borowitz is a precious national asset - a hip, modern-day Will Rogers whose hilarious new send-up of corporate culture and the nation's ongoing corporate corruption scandals adds up to insightful and hilarious social commentary."
3,Not riveting.,"Clever, but a bit shallow. Andy keeps me entertained on Twitter and Facebook, but this was a wade through deep mud."
2,Andy should stick to his great columns!,"I love Andy Borowitz' humor in ""The Borowitz Report"", and always read it. This slim book just doesn't have much substance, however. It should have just been used for a couple of ""Reports""."
3,Who Moved My Soap? not Andy's best....,"I enjoy Andy Borowitz's daily newsletters much more than I did his book, 'Who Moved My Soap?: The CEO's Guide to Surviving Prison: The Bernie Madoff Edition"". The book was rather silly and simply did not get me laughing. I had greater expectations for Andy's book and they simply were not met. I appreciate all the time and effort Andy puts into his work and making it available to the masses."
2,not andy's best.....,I find Andy B to be a very creative and humorus writer....his periodic blogs are timely and funny. This effort however is not his best - it's a joke that goes too long...loses it's punch. It's mainly an opportunistic marketing ploy to take advantage of the Bernie Madoff scandal...and imprisonment.
3,Wrong Edition,This is not the 2009 Bernie Madoff edition of the book. It is the original 2003 edition of the book. While it is a funny book it is not the book advertised.Who Moved My Soap Prepack 6: The CEO's Guide to Surviving in Prison
2,Overrated,"The funniest parts of this book are the ones used to get you to buy it, the rest was lame. I found myself yawning. The only good thing about this book is how small it is, the boredom ends in a couple of hours."
4,Nothing Boring about Borowitz,"Borowitz has written a truly funny book, and it's extra special because it's a satire of another concept others have taken so seriously. It's not so funny, though, when you really get ""surprised"" from behind in prison, if you know what I mean."
1,Terrible...,This trick is terrible. Not what I expected at all. The picture is completely decieving and is not a cup. I would not recommend this at all.
5,Great CD - You will NOT be disappointed,Excellent Service. Fab CD. If you have never heard Walter Jackson sing then that is why you probably don't have any of his cd's yet. Phenomenal!
4,"Pretty good, but not all new to me","I bought this book when my twins were 9 months old and I wanted some guidance on daytime napping, and a lot of friends had recommended Healthy Sleep Habits... I didn't mean to buy 'Your fussy Baby', since mine are too old for that- so be careful when you buy this package that you get both books. I had already read a lot of books on sleep training, and while there were some really good tips here, I found 'The Contented Little Baby Book' by Gina Ford more direct. Weissbluth allows for more discretion which I think a mother needs, and overall I think this is a very good book to be read in conjunction with other philosophies, and you can adapt what works for your style and babies. A must-read if your baby doesn't sleep very much and you think it is OK that way- it's not!"
3,"another baby book, but with a difference","the interesting thing about these books is the amount of time he spends on the research that he and others have done on baby sleep and colic. however, in _your fussy baby_ he recommends that if you have a fussy baby you go straight to the final chapter which is basically a recap of the book. I did this and it made me feel TERRIBLE because I didn't understand his approach, so I thought he was basically saying that I was a failure at soothing my baby and it was my fault he has problems sleeping. So, don't take his advice about that, just read the book in the order it's given, and you won't have that problem."
4,"Hesitant to use, but keep coming back to it!","I read this book with my first son and didn't want to try it cause it felt cruel and too rigid. But, nine months later no one was getting any sleep and when I tried the sleep methods in the book my son went to sleep in his crib and slept through the night. It took a couple days to get him used to the situation, but I wished I would have done it sooner. When we had our second child I thought I knew it all, but new sleep problems arose and again I turned to this book found the answers, didn't like them, but did them anyways and guess what? They worked."
4,A Great Book for all Kids,"This book is a wonderful book for people who are intested in the beach and WWII!! I liked this book because it was thrilling and exciting! It always keeps your attention and you always know what it happening! Nell Wise Wechter did a wonderful job! You will find that the introduction is just as good as the book! If you have not read this book, you should! Now I know why it is on Battle of the Books for the year 2001!"
4,"Move Quickly to Get ""Movin' Right Along""","Texas tenor saxophonist Arnett Cobb's ""Movin' Right Along"" was recorded the day after his excellentMore Party Timeon February 17, 1961, and features the same band too -- Bobby Timmons on piano, Sam Jones on bass, Art Taylor on drums and Buck Clark on conga. (One track, ""Fast Ride,"" is from 2/16/61 and has Tommy Flanagan replacing Timmons and Danny Barrajanos replacing Clark. Amusingly, ""More Party Time"" also has one track from 2/17 -- why didn't they just put all the 16th songs on one album and all the 17th ones on the other?) If you like your jazz laden with the blues, with plenty of lone star state swagger, then this is your kind of party. But you'll need to move right along and get this CD if you are interested, it is quickly going out-of-print."
5,Laura Todd is hunting for treasure . . .,"well, actually she's hunting for a mysterious heir who's going to inherit a fortune, if she can find them. Devlin Rafferty is hiding in Ireland, trying to heal emotional wounds that threaten to tear him apart. Ultimately, Laura finds her heir, and a love she never believed possible on the Emerald Isle. But is Devlin's love strong enough to overcome his pain? I laughed, and I sniffled as I read Laura and Devlin's story, Sex, Lies and Leprechauns . I'll be watching for Renee Roszel's new releases, and her extensive backlist."
1,Kindle version almost impossible to use,"The content of this book seems to be good, but my problem is that the kindle version has no table of contents, no index and no search function. It is therefore impossible to quickly find the section that you want or the topic you want - you have to page through the entire book until something useful appears. This is a fatal flaw for a reference book."
1,Kindle version is impossible to use,"I agree with a previous reviewer. The Kindle version is impossible to use, because it has no table of contents or index or any way to look up a term. If you search for ""prime number"" for example, you get 75 hits but there is no indication which one is the definition. Recommend that unless this book is tagged with a table of contents that you stick with the paper copy."
5,Best High School/Basic College Math Dictionary available,Simply put this is the best math dictionary out there for the high school level and for most college students. Maybe there are some more appropriate ones for upper level college math/science students. I have found the descriptions and links in the text very clear and appropriate for most students. I greatly prefer this one over the Oxford math dictionary.I highly recommend it for high school math students (and make sure you keep it until you are done with college). When more detail is needed beyond this text there's always google.
1,Horrible negative stars,The DVD was unwatchable the sound was intermittent.Positively the worst purchase I have ever made on AmazonI suspect the DVD was a Pirate copy
1,Truly awful!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read some reviews here and elsewhere that sounded positive, but honestly this film was AWFUL. My friend and I seriously discussed leaving after the first 20 minutes (somthing I have never done before), but decided to stick it out and hope that it would get better. It did, but only marginally. I ended up wishing that I had walked in the first place and not wasted my time and $9.00 on this sea of stupid lines and pointless ""plot"". It was insulting to both Hawaiians and Trans-gender people and most of all was NOT FUNNY, truly. I like Drew Barrymore, and Adam Sandler when he is playing a character with a brain in his head--and there is chemistry between these actors(...). Rent The Wedding Singer instead. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY--if you are over the age of 11 this film is too immature for you. And if you are under the age of 11 you will be bored."
2,Lame attempt to make a great movie,"I was expecting a lot more out of this movie then what I got.It's basically about a girl who lost her short-term memory in an auto-moblie accident and some guy tries to get her to fall in love with him, yadda, yadda, yadda...There was a lot of jokes that fell flat on their backs' in this movie, after awhile it really begins to annoy you.The acting is nothing great and the diolouge is flat-out horrible.Sandler doesn't give a good performance and Barrymore is okay.Basically, it's a repeatitive movie that delivers lame jokes and the same thing every ten minutes.If you're looking for a good movie, look elsewhere.This is a very lame, unfunny, boring and stupid movie. Save your money for something worthwhile."
1,blah,"Once again all the funny stuff was in the previews. This could have been such a funny movie, but wasn't. Don't bother."
1,wow..................,"Can Adam get much worse? This is a naturally bad and stupid movie. Adam Sandler needs to give up, he is not funny anymore. All he does is play the same type of character in all of his movies. Don't buy this film, or anymore Adam Sandler movies to come."
3,"not enough silly comedy, more drama then expected.","Not a bad movie, but not nearly as funny as it should have been. Pretty much all of the funniest parts were in the commercials, not suprisingly. And the parts that were funny, were carbon copy's of other funny scenes in other sandler movies. It's fun when you recognize a line here and there from other movies, but when there's entire scenes...it gets old fast. It also gets old seeing all the same people in all of his stupid movies. It's cool to see a cameo here and there, but it's always all the same loosers. If I could have avoided seeing it, I would. Kind of a disapointment. Dan Aykroyd had a minor role. The only thing good there was he mentions kallahan auto parts, which in the movie tommy boy, was the company he was trying to forcefully takeover from tommy kallahan.I miss Happy Gillmore :)"
4,50 First Dates,"Adam Sandler plays a guy that is about to giveup on love until he meets Drew Barrymore whohas a short-term memory loss, where she forgetseverything the next day; she can only rememberanything that has happened before the tragicmoment in her life that messed up her brain."
3,For girls !,"I have been quite disappointed. Stealing the idea of ""Memento"" with humour, I thought it will be great and funny. At the end, I found the plot very flat. The end is cool though but well, this movie has been done to make your girlfriend cry. Sandler still plays the same kind of characters as usual but with maybe softer lines. Drew Barrimore is of course HOT HOT HOT but well, something is simply not there. Is it because of a weak script? the direction and the edition are not fantastic either. To conclude I will say it's still good entertainment and not a bad movie but It's for sure NOT the best Sandler movie and certainly not the greatest comedy!"
3,Mostly well done but ultimately troubling,"This movie combines themes from ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Memento"" to make a romantic comedy about a woman who never remembers the prior day, and the man who falls in love with her anyway. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore do terrific jobs as the leads, and the supporting cast is excellent too. The only problem with the movie, and it's a big one, is Adam Sandler's motivation for continuing to pursue Ms Barrymore after discovering her ailment, and the underlying sickly feeling that he is continuously taking advantage of a brain-damaged woman. Even though the movie is well-done on every other level it cannot escape that fact, and ultimately seriously undermines both the romance and the comedy."
5,HILARIOUS!!!,"Just from watching the previews, I knew that it was a good movie. Little did I know that I was wrong. This is the best movie to watch with a boyfriend/girlfriend. It's classic Adam Sandler comedy along with Drew Barrymore charm!"
4,Forgotten Love,"Adam Sandler, typically a vulgar, careless person, expressed a totally different side of his acting abilities in this film. Instead of playing an entirely comedic role, Sandler was a loving, caring man who developed a relationship with a beautiful woman, Drew Barrymore. Barrymore as well, playing the part of a gorgeous young lady plagued by the occurrence of a car accident, does a beautiful job of portraying her character. She falls in love with Sandler, but the car wreck causes her to relive a single day of her life over and over, causing her to forget all about her meeting with Sandler. Once Sandler figures out her handicap, he desperately tries to conjure up a way to help her remember him and their relationship to preserve the love they feel for each other. I highly recommend this movie. It is worth seeing multiple times.-Cdawg"
5,Loved It--Just Loved It (What an adorable movie),"I saw the previews on TV for this movie and finally talked my husband into renting it. (He usually pick out all the movies and they are usually kick-em-up types or blow-em-up ones.) My husband rented 3 movies that night, and this one was a ""token"" chick flick ""for me.""He put off watching it the first night, but the second night we watched it because the other movie was way too long. We were both moved by this movie and came away absolutely ""in love"" with it. My husband even had to admit that ""my movie"" was an ""us movie.""This movie is just really fun to watch and takes you on a journey that involves so many emotions--just what to look for in a good film."
5,Touching Film,"Adam S. and Drew B. make a bangup team in this movie! Drew is beautiful and quite an innocent soul. It had a satisfying, yet surprising ending. A good twist.It's refreshing to watch a comedy with characters who HAVE character. Makes for an uplifting viewing.Drew B's character wakes up every morning thinking it's her father's birthday . . . the same day in which she had an auto accident that injured her memory.Adam Sandler falls for her and figures out a way for them to live happily ever after.Heartwarming and hilarious!"
4,'Feel good' movie,"Every time I watch this movie, it makes me 'feel GOOD'! It proves that LOVE will find a way (although sometimes it takes a genius to figure out what that way will be).I loved the romantic parts of this movie, especially the idea of the 'first kiss' which Drew Barrymore got to experience over and over because of her short term memory problem.It could have been better without the crude humor but the relationship between Adam Sandler's character and Drew Barrymore's charactor is reason enough to watch this movie.The ending never fails to give me chills..it's heartwarming and terrific!"
4,This movie is histerical!,"Yes Adam does always play the same role in every movie he does but I knew that going in. Overall I found this movie to be cute and sweet. I thought Drew Berrymore's character was great, she did a wonderful job and I thought her comedic timing was great.I also thought Doug(Lucy's brother;played by Sean Astin)he was so funny. I thought Sean Astin was extremely funny in this role.Rob Schiender is funny, but he is also always playing the same weird bizarre/your character scares me roles that he got a bit annoying. Overall though I thought this movie was really good and is a perfect movie to see if you are on a date!"
5,"Awesome movie, already watched over 60 times!!!!","This is the best movie I have seen in a LONG time, I dont know what it is that has made me watch it over 60 times already, and I am far from being sick of it, I seen it 4 times in theatres and I waited the 3 months until the day it was released to buy it, if you haven't yet seen it, watch it, better yet buy it, you wont be dissapointed, and I promise you no matter how many times you watch it, it is still as great as the first time!!!!!"
2,One to Forget in the Morning After,"After ""The Wedding Singer"", Sandler and Barrymore reunite on screen again to deliver this somewhat promising but ultimately average romantic comedy. Remember Guy Pearce`s character in ""Memento""? Well, in ""50 First Dates"" Drew Barrymore plays Lucy, a girl that loses her recent memory each morning, virtually living the same routine endlessly. Adam Sandler`s character falls in love with her and dares to conquer her attention everyday. Cute, and very touching. Anyway, this movie ends up being too repetitive, slow, empty and especially unfunny, mixing drama and comedy yet failing to suceed at both. The directing is nothing special either, and the performances and characters are flat. Fortunately, the flick still presents some entertainment value, so it`s not a complete disaster. But there are much better movies around (Bernardo Bertolucci`s ""The Dreamers"" or Michel Gondry`s ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", to name a few).Watchable and equally forgettable."
1,For small gutter minds,"There is much raunch in this movie trying to pass as humor.And give me a break. Sandler a ""man about town"" banging the tourists evry chance he gets. YUK. Oh but wait! He gets totally reformed overnight and becomes the most selfless, committed, sacrificial man who is willing to wait forever and enjoy a lifelong relationship with a woman who forgets him every day. Sure. Maybe if he would have been a virgin looking for his one true love then it would have been beliveable.And all the boob, ass, homo, vomit, sex jokes are just plain mindless and talentless. ""are you sure you will still love her in 15 years if she lets herself go and sex with her is nauseating"" How would you like that said as you say your wedding vows while the ""preacher"" is looking at his fat wife? It's not funny. It's just tasteless and tacky.The only good thing about this movie is the end."
1,Awful!,"I enjoyed The Wedding Singer, I honestly did. I thought Sandler and Barrymore had good chemistry, the script was entertaining, there were some good jokes... and most of all it refrained from being corny, slow and boring. Now lets take 50 First Dates. Lets take out the good chemistry (what happened? God knows!), the entertaining script (boo, bum and vomit gags only go so far), and any good jokes and what do you have? This film! Ok, it's not as bad as, lets say, Mr Deeds or Little Nicky, but it was a massive disapointment. It came across like a last minute idea Sandler and his buddies had while vacationing in Hawaii and though, ah hell, lets do a version of Groundhog Day here and pass it off as a movie!Do yourself a favour. You want to watch 'a nice romantic comedy'... rent When Harry Met Sally. Wit over crass wins everytime!"
3,"the movie was funny, but the soundtrack sucks","I watched this movie twice, and I got a few laughs out of it. Adam Sandler is nothing like Jim Carrey, but he is funny. he did a good job of serenading Lucy (Drew Barrymore) in the movie. there was another unfunny moment in the movie and that was when the gay guy was wanting to make love to Henry Roth. Homosexuality is not funny. she found out that every day is not Sunday the 13th when a cop gave her a ticket. about the soundtrack. it really sounded stupid. it was mostly Bob Marley and No Doubt. as I have said before, No Doubt SUCKS! if Adam Sandler is listening to that crap, he is going to have a hard time getting laid."
2,Dumbbbbbb,This is one of the worst Adam Sandler movies out there. This is a rental only and not worth buying.
3,cute,"This was a comedy starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore (and the always annoying Rob Schneider). Drew plays a woman who loses her memory each morning when she wakes up. Adam gets to try each day to make her fall in love with him, over and over again. The acting was pretty good, and the movie had it's funny moments, but really this was just a stupid (but cute) comedy."
3,Love the movie not the Blu-ray version,"I really love this movie and i can't stop watching it over and over again.However, I was a little disappointed with the quality of the Blu-ray version. Felt like it's just a dvd quality."
4,It can't get any more romantic than this!,"To be so much in love, to try to get your loved one to fall in love with you again and again every single day... what more can I say? It's all told with Sandler's performance..."
5,Equal Parts Romantic and Comedy,Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore give memorable performances in this very funny romantic comedy. Don't worry guys this isn't a total chick flick just kinda. This movie was shot in the very beautiful state of Hawaii. Of course the Sandman makes this movie very worth buying.
3,I will waste my time and your's,"This review is not going to say anything that hasn't been said about Adam Sandler movies before, but I believe this is fitting, seeing as Sandler hasn't given us anything new since Billy Madison. Don't get me wrong, this movie has its funny moments, coupled by a really, really cute love story that will lead to some ridiculous conflict, which is eventually resolved and where upon Sandler ends up with the woman of his dreams. Of course, this sums up just about every Sandler movie out there, but I did think that the ""Memento"" twist in the story was kind of interesting. So, I won't say this is a bad movie, because it's not, but you could get the same story from any of Sandler's movies. I realize that this review is pointless, but I'm bored and feel like criticizing something... viva la internet."
3,A gift,Bought this as a gift. The person bought for enjoys Sara Evans music. They requested this CD so I bought it for them.
4,awesome movie and picture quality,"im sad that the regular dvd had more special features than the blu ray version, i loved watching the music videos and such on the regular dvd, this one is just blah but good"
5,great date movie.,"my husband and I went to see this movie, and it had some great laughs, we love adam sandler and drew barrymore in the wedding singer and loved them just as much in this movie."
3,Somehow manages to be heartfelt,"Imagine the Bobby Goldsboro song 'Honey' - you know the one! A tearjerker about a loving young couple, and the have a puppy and the woman dies and... well imagine instead the lyrics went something like 'He was a flirt but changed his ways, she was so lovely it changed him so. She was such a special girl, couldn't remember anything, but, what the heck. She was in a car accident, it was just so very sad, have to say. Her father paints the garage white everyday, 13th of October paper out, all the time. She always thinks it's Sunday, her husband is a stranger to her, every morning'. Well, that's '50 first dates'.Yet, on screen, it's quite a nice story, and with some side characters to act the fool it is quite entertaining, but not one that's too memorable, but more heartfelt than the goofy poster lets on. About six out of ten."
1,Scratched and skipping,I thought it would be fun to bring along some movies set in Hawaii on our family trip. What a disappointment when we missed half the movie bc the item sent was so substandard.
3,Humore meets drama,"Characters like 10 second tom just make you laugh, cry, and listen! They add a light to the film and make it speed up like a big tornado whirling you away to Hawai where this movie takes place. It starts like a regular romantic comedy but then turnes into something wonderful. Adam Sandlers in this movie is a man who keeps dating but just can't fingd the right person until he goes to the cafe. There he sees the pretty, cheerful Drew Barrymore. He falls in love with her instantley. But then he finds out she has a memory problem and she won't remember who he is the next day. And then goes a series of efforts to make her remember him. The movies really predictebel and I'm getting a bit tired of these kind of movies. Adam Sandler is very talented but he plays too much of the same person. It's like these movies are all one long movie. But I can't resist watching 50 first Dates. But again how can you mot resist?"
4,Some hilarious parts,"I can't say much that the other reviewers haven't already said. This movie has some freaking hilarious scenes - my most favorite one is where Adam Sadnler's character is at the diner and fake crying because he is acting as if he doesn't know how to read, wailing and moaning and sobbing to catch the attention of the girl he wants."
4,Even Adam Sandler was OK!,"I usually despise Adam Sandler. I find his brand of humor cheesy and distasteful. However, I must confess this movie captured me. Drew Barrymore is extremely charming, probably along with Ever After. The soundtrack, which uses mostly songs from the 1980s covered by current artists conveys perfectly the nature of this movie. Rob Schneider, another person I can't stand is actually extremely funny. And Sandler is great, measurate and endearing. Even the scatological jokes work! This is a great, enjoyable date movie, one you can have to fall in love in it again. If it is 4 stars it is because a couple of Sandler's routines irritated me a little bit but the movie was surprisingly good. Rent it or buy it."
4,"extremely funny, surprizingly sweet and rather sad.",The first semi serious movie that i have seen played by Adam Sandler and co-stars Drew Barrymore and after watching the movie i found it to be better than i expected not only is the movie outragesly funny bad a rather sad side is added to the story enough to make some cry. The movie has the same humour as Adams previuos movies but it just as funny none the less.The movie starts with adams character going at with all the girls but dumping them soon after until one afternoon he finds himself visiting a calm ocean side restaurant where he meets Lucy(Drew Barrymore) who day after day he would fall in love with until he has to think of an appropriate method for her to live her life the best she possibly can.#with a combination of witty and desgusting characters makes the movie a very enjoyable watch with the same original humour of previous Adam sandler movies but is just as enjoyable i would highly recommend you watching the movie yourself.
4,alot like life - funny & tragic,"I won't bore you with the plot of the movie as I assume you have an idea what it's about if you've come this far. I found the film stood up quite well as a romantic comedy. It was both delightfully funny and a bit sad at times (just like life). I am surprised that some of the reviewers have taken the film so seriously and are disturbed by how the critical events are portrayed. It's just a film and it's meant to entertain. It did a great job of that, with the terrific on-screen chemistry of Sandler (although I can't stand him in most other films) and Barrymore."
3,"Ummm, only ok","Fast foward through the first 10min of the movie and it actually becomes watchable, not that it ever gets good. That is my only advice, heed it and you'll do well my son."
2,What happened?,"I made the mistake of going into this movie with The Wedding Singer in mind. I LOVED that movie, but this one cannot begin to live up to it. What a shame and a waste of time. Appealed to my 14 year old mainly do to the inane one liners and oftenRAW comments. What does the size of the Walrus' member have to do with anything in this movie other than an attempt to add filler to an otherwise dull and overplayed plot."
3,Romantic Comedy that forgot the Comedy!,"Maybe the writers of this film had amnesia a la Ms. Barrymore's character. They forgot to put the comedy in this film. The film has its moments, but way too few to warrant more than one rental. It has none of the hysterical Sandler that we've come to enjoy."
2,Unnerving,"I don't know why, but this movie disturbed me. Perhaps it was the concept of the film. Or me imagining that happening to me what was happening to Drew Barrymore's character. Whatever it was, it kept me from enjoying the movie. I did not really find it sweet or cute or funny in any way. It was just odd. I know that people do experience such an awful form of memory loss, but to me, that makes a good dramatic film. Not a romantic comedy. I mean, I can understand why people would wish to make light of the situation and make it romantic and whatnot, but for me, it didn't work. And the parts that were supposed to be funny, really weren't. It was all kind of desperate actually."
3,Silly But Touching,"Adam Sandler's movies are oh so goofy. His idea of humor can be annoyhing at times. However, intermixed between all the childish behavior is that true love is oh so beautiful. And Sandler does show his vulnerable side.Fortunately this movie is relatively short because it is not long on depth. Nonetheless, the characters are all kind of amusing. If you are in the mood for something not overly ellaborate and light-hearted, this flick will fit the bill."
5,Already a classic!,"This movie is nothing less of a classic. It's the kind of feel good movie that reminds you there really are good and loving people in the world, eventhough the man of your dreams is also well known for the ""Turkey Song""."
5,50 First Laffs,it was a lol. (laugh out loud) i tell ya. it isn't rated R it's a 13. pg-13 that is. i loved it it was like so funny i couldn't like stand it it was like that good i could not stop laffing. i like to spell laff and laffing the way i am spelling them. and i love this film and my brother met adam sandler.
4,entertaining,"Even though nothing in this movie resembles reality, the plot is funny and entertaining. Adam and Drew have chemestry. Overall it is a good natured romantic comedy that makes you daydream about the silly things that people do for love."
3,50 First Dates,"While the movie does have some funny parts, and some people will like the romance in it, the whole concept of the movie is rather boring. The girl wakes up and does the same thing every day, thus, most of the movie is repetitious.For the most part, I did enjoy it, and am glad I went and saw it, but I have no desire to see it again."
2,so-so,"i think the love brids are hyping this movie up, this is a review from someone that doesnt by into the love movie Douche thing: Not adams best, very repeatative movie. I dont think he will ever make another Happy gilmore, or Billy madison movie."
5,im still lmao,"I love this movie! It was very funny, yet sweet and touching. Altough the ending was a bit shocking to me,I'll be first in line to buy it when it comes out. Adam and Drew work great together. Hawaii is beautiful, the soundtrack rocks, and this movie is awesom! GO SEE IT!! GO NOW!!"
4,Sandler rewards his fans,"As a previous poster had mentioned, I too am on the fence about Adam Sandler. For every fun movie (Wedding Singer) there was an equally unfunny movie(Little Nicky). I'm glad to see him back in fine form in this selection.I mention that Sandler rewards his fans, it also seems to me that Sandler has to be one of the most loyal friends. In nearly every movie you will see reoccuring bit actors; from Allen Covert, Rob Schneider, Blake Clark and Peter Dante. There was also an homage to friend Chris Farley and the movie ""Tommy Boy"". If you notice carefully Lucy goes to the Callahan Institute funded by Callahan Motors in Sandusky, Ohio. For a fan of ""Tommy Boy"" this was a rare treat.The slapstick was toned down in favor of sincerity without being schmaltzy. The chemistry between Barrymore and Sandler that worked in ""Wedding Singer"" definitely works again. The ending will leave you oddly touched. Kudos on the soundtrack as well."

4,Cute love story wrapped in a comedy.,Adam Sandler has always surprised me. I don't like silly movies so I tend to avoid actors who appear to be the type who play silly parts. Every movie I've seen with Sandler is funny but not silly. I've come to the point where I tend to seek out Sandler movies now because I enjoy them so much.Recently I took an inventory of our DVD collection and I could not find my copy of 40 First Dates. I found it for a low price here on Amazon.com so ordered it to fill that slot in m library.
5,fifty first dates,"i love adam, drew,rob, missi and dan and everyone else in the movie.i love how adam sandler uses all of the same people in his movies.i hope they all keep making these great movies."
3,50 First Dates Review,"It's charmingly romantic and funny. And, like so many of Sandler's lowest-common-denominator comedies, it's suffused with slapstick and gross-out gags. The chuckles here are few and far between. The movie's sole selling point turns out to be its sweetness. Director Peter Segal tries to find humor in the situation, but he misses more often than he hits. It's like trying to make a comedy about Alzheimer's. The occasional bouts of scatology and crude sexual humor function, if you'll permit the oxymoron, as vulgar grace notes, decorating a surprisingly graceful and, in the end, impressively daring romantic comedy. (...)"
5,Adorable,"Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler turn their adorable charm up to full blast and its enough to carry this film over the bridge of believabilty. I can't imagine the pressure trying to make someone fall in love with you everyday-then again-maybe it's something that we all should strive for. Surely a task like that would lower the divorce rate. Whenever I run across this film I can't help but smile. That's a good thing, right? Highly recommended."
2,perfume,This did not have a fruity smell at all and had to be thrown out because it is definatley not something I would ever wear again.
3,Seemed a little diluted,"Mackie By Bob Mackie For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 OuncesThis seemed a little diluted from what you normally receive from a department store, but still the same fragrance. For the price - not a bad deal."
2,"Very potent juice, too much for my personal nose","This is a beautiful fragrance for those who adore something heavy, almost syrupy, to wear. It's a very deep, sweet and spicy scent, kind of like Estee Lauder's Spellbound, which is also too heavy for my own personal taste. But some people review this most enthusiastically, so it's worth giving it a try. The price is right, so not a huge loss if it doesn't do it for you."
5,Great product,This is by far my favorite perfume. Glad to see I can still purchase it! And at an affordable price!
4,Bubblingly Beautiful,"Just plain great. Temporary Residence ceases to amaze me with each release, and this is no exception."
3,As I expected this older book was in older condition.,As I expected this older book was in older condition. But my purpose was sentimental so it was fine. I gave it to my adult daughter. When she was little I borrowed it from the library to help her deal with her older brothers teasing. It was a fun memory for us.
5,Best. Cookbook. EVER.,"After all the decades of my life, I have found the perfect cookbook. The recipes are simple, but it is all in the doing. For example, the way to prepare a pot roast is clear and very simple, but it is all in the way to do it which leads to the best ever potroast that I have made five times now. The amount of cholesterol in this book may make you blanch, but cover the eyes of your doctor and just do it. Eat lots of salad in addition as penance and you can get away with the wonderful recipes of this book from the 40's."
4,How to play with the devil,"A beautiful rewriting of Faust. A bad guy is killed by anotHer crook when coming out of prison and finds himself in hell. But he is a perfect image of a judge who fights against corruption. So Satan proposes a deal : get into the judge's body and destroy his reputation. But it will not work that way and the bad boy will completely destroy Satan's plan. He negociates then his promotion in hell as a trustee, one of the bosses. He is in a way saved from damnation but in hell itself. Very entertaining and interesting to see how Satan miscalculated his project : a bad guy put in the body of a good guy is transformed by the transfer, and even some of his bad guy's natural reactions fire back and produce the opposite effect : it increases the good image of the judge. In other words one is bad or good according to the surrounding circumstances in which one lives, according to the picture the public has of this one, a good or bad representation.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
4,Judge for your self,"Nick (Claude Rains) never satisfied with the amount of soles caught, has his hat set for an incorruptible judge. He will recruit Eddie Kagle to replace Judge Fredrick Parker (both played by Paul Muni) in exchange for a second chance at life.If you were, raised Catholic then you will recognize the title as you have a devil on one shoulder and an angle on the other and you are struggling in the middle.There is great interaction between Paul Muni and Claude Rains. This move takes unexpected twists and turns. I may remind you a little of ""The Devil and Daniel Webster ""(1941). However, no one can play ""Nick"" as well as Claude Rains.I rather like the way they return to the surface. I never trusted those types of elevators. Before you write off Anne Baxter as just another personality in this film, remember that she was also Nefretiri in ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956)The Devil & Daniel Webster - Criterion Collection"
1,Beware this version,"This version of the film, from ROAN, should be avoided. The hour and 41 minute original is here chopped to an hour and 30 minutes. A mutilated film is no bargain at any price."
1,my 2 cents,"This is a good story along the lines of ""Here Comes Mr. Jordon"", with a slight variation. But the DVD quality of the Gotham release is horrible. The picture quality is almost unwatchable and the un-even mono sound has a steady hissing all the way through the movie."
1,"Stay Away From Passport - Large ""PIP"" Logo On Screen","Both Passport DVD's I've had the misfortune of viewing (this one & Plan 9 From Outer Space) have a large ""PIP"" logo on screen for the entire movie which is extremely distracting & unneccesary. For quality, get the Roan edition."
4,A Gangster goes to Hell and meets the Devil.,"If you can't sleep or it's raining outside and you don't have to work tomorrow, here is a good late night movie to watch. Paul Muni plays a gangster, ""Eddie"", who has just been released after four years in prison. A gangster pal, ""Smiley"", picks him up in a car. Suddenly, Eddie is shot and he ends up in Hell. Claude Rains plays the Devil. The Devil decides to let Eddie go back up on Earth. He puts him in another body, a look-alike who is a Judge. All that Eddie can think of is getting even with Smiley for shooting him. But everyone else looks at him as The Judge who is not himself anymore. Ann Baxter plays ""Miss Barbara""."
4,Ironic fantasy about gangster reprieved from Hell.,"A brilliant dark comedy about a dead gangster restored to life in the body of an honorable man (his look-alike). Paul Muni plays the protagonist well, but the film is stolen by Claude Rains as the Devil---one of Rains's all-time best performances. It's an absorbing film, splendidly directed, with an intelligent script that's immensely funny. Deserves a new life."
4,Devil or the Angel?,"Paul Muni plays a gangster brought back to life after he was killed by another evil guy named Smiley Williams. Muni makes a deal with the devil (Claude Rains) and he's brought back as a man who's a judge running for governor! Muni doesn't know Cluade Rains is the devil because he just calls himself Nick, and he says he's an ex- con. Anne Baxter plays the fiancee of the judge and Muni likes her a lot. Lots of people see the change in Muni and soon are wondering if it really is him. There's one scene where Muni wants a drink of liquor and a cigar. But since he's now in the judge's body he coughs it up and feels horrible. Later, Muni finds out that Nick is the Devil and starts distrusting him. Somehow even thoguh this is a little serious, it is also quite funny. THis is a good movie! ENJOY!"
2,The angel slipped,This is a light weight film with a heavy weight star. The film is not worthy of the great Paul Muni.
3,interesting but flawed,"Writing a convincing movie of this genre is difficult. The biggest problem is that Eddie in the judge's body acts like Eddie. In real life, the ""judge"" would be committed. This aspect was overdone. The concept of the devil not being all that smart is an interesting concept. I dislike the juvenile delinquency theories presented. I know that I am being hard on a movie that could have been a brilliant study on the nature of good and evil. It is still worth watching. Paul Muni is good though the script compells Muni to exaggerate. Claude Rains transcends the script and is outstanding."
4,Interesting Movie,"Saw this old movie on TV and had to have it to show my family. The quality of the movie wasn't very good since it is such an old move, but the story is great. I liked the theory that we'll be shoveling coal in Hell if we have that misfortune to go there. We got a lot of laughs as well as a good moral to the story."
1,Even Claude Rains is subdued,"Paul Muni won an Oscar, but not for this surprisingly dull movie. Claude Rains, lovable rogue in Casablanca, isn't lovable or rogueish as Satan in this movie. Anne Baxter is whiny. I bought this for my daughter, because she loved it. Oh, well."
5,$99- what!?!,"I have this cookbook and I love it and want to buy it for another couple. The recipes are really fun, very good, and well organized. But $99-- what the heck? Doesn't anyone sell a new copy of this for less??"
5,Great book!,"Finally, a cookbook that lets us cook together! The recipes are great, the instructions are clearly described for two people, and the meals are delicious. Cooking has never been more fun. The pork roast is fabulous. We're looking forward to preparing the Ultimate Valentines Day dinner. We also loved the ""Marinating the Chef"" concept."
3,First of the Corum Chronicles,"This book is the first of the Swords Trilogy, part of the Chronicles of Corum, which in turn is part of the Eternal Champions cycle (Michael Moorcock is very prolific!).The book follows the adventures of Prince Corum, who seeks vengance on those who murdered his family, and destroyed his race, the Vadagh. He finds that his quest is part of a greater struggle; between Law and Chaos, and that mortals are just the pawns of the gods. Along the way, he makes a bargain with a sorcerer, finds true love and confronts the ruler of the first five plane: The Knight of Swords.Not bad as swords and sorceries go, but the pace is very rushed. Better than Moorcock's Sci-fi stuff though..."
2,Not as hoped,"This is a perfectly sized steamer for a pound of shrimp or veggies. The quality is good as well. I really thought I had a winner with this steamer. However, the steamer basket did not fit well into the lower pot--seemed too big and sat up on an angle on one side. You'd think quality control at the manufacturer would catch something like that. I promptly returned it for a refund."
1,Don't Buy Me *They did help,"I purchased this item last year and have used it about 5 times. While steaming some tamales last night, not only did the pot turn my oven covers completely black (currently soaking in baking soda and vinegar) but upon further review the bottom lip of the pot is completely separated from the remainder of the pot. What the heck? I am going to throw this in the dumpster now. Unless you guys will refund me. * After posting this I got a positive email from the company. Thank you guys"
4,Good pot,"I purchased this for my college dorm since we didn't have any pots large enough. I'm very satisfied with the pot itself and I use it all the time, but the steamer is much too thin and I really wish it had some legs for support. Overall good price for your money, but if you're getting it for the steamer I'd look for something else."
5,air ratchet,air ratchet workes on 4cfms of air witch is about all my compressor can handle. it has good speed and power also workes in tight quarters witch is what i need when i work on my equipment.couple that with good service and quick delivery. works for me.
5,Vincent: Insightful and brave journalist,"I met Steven Vincent days after In the Red Zone had been submitted to the publisher. His personal reflections from 9/11, when he stood atop his apartment building and watch the second plane hit, brought tears to my eyes. But that was nothing compared to his remarkable insight into Iraq from his journeys there. Fresh from returning and putting his thoughts into written form, he regaled me for hours with what he learned and what all Americans must know about Iraq. I cannot recommend In the Red Zone more highly."
5,Running With Sally's Brilliant First Album,"Evocative of, yet arguably exeeding, the lyrics of Bob Dylan's Time Out Of Mind and the master musicianship of Wide Spread Panic's Ain't Life Grand, The First Sally melds rock with funk and country in a challenging, roaring, at times careening, completely enjoyable musical experience. The album captures the energy of one of the best live acts in the West. Trevor Clendenin and Chris Sheldon's vocals take center stage amidst musicianship pushed to the limits on such Sally staples as Cadillac, Cowboy Vai, and especially the Denver radio favorite Porno Music. Do -not- miss the chance to listen to this first work from Colorado's best rock and roll band. Also check out the Sally's website for tour dates throughout the Mountain West and for a release date on thier soon forthcoming second album."
4,Adoptable Dog: My new fav book about my new fav pet,"I found this book to be exptremely informative, easy to understand, and fun to read. There are a lot of unknowns when it comes to adopting a dog -- especially for us first-time dog owners. This book really tackled the big questions I had as well as had easy-to-follow step-by-step training exercises.The author is obviously very much in favor of his own training methods, but he at least explains why he thinks they are the best in order for the reader to research and make up their own mind.I would recommend reading this book to anyone thinking about adopting a dog!"
3,Not as good as other books.,"We read the Mystery and Mount Vernon and love it. This Alamo one was not so exciting. The perpetrator who was arrested was actually a child - which turned me off a lot. The historical information on the Alamo is good, and we love the characters in these books. Will probably read more, but get them from the library rather than invest in them."
5,BEST MACROECONOMICS TEXTBOOK AVAILABLE,"Among all the textbooks I have seen in economics, I have found Mankiw's to be the best. It is clear and concise, addressing all the important intermediate issues in macroeconomics. The description of concepts is simple, and the book benefits from a three pronged approach to teaching - graphical, mathematical, and anecdotal. The student is free to choose whichever one he feels most comfortable learning from."
5,Vintage Barry White,"My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed this CD. Excellent condition, packaged well, more than expected."
2,Cute but uncomfortable,"Despite the relatively low heel, this cute little number is uncomfortable for walking more than a few feet. Fine for sitting down and looking nice."
3,Rainy Day Movie,"This is the type of movie when you do not feel like doing the work you should be doing, it's raining and you need a little comedy, a little mystery and a good story line. That's Topper Returns. I've always loved Rochester and I enjoy the part when he says ""I'm going back to Mr. Benny. Nothing like this ever happens with him."" This can be watched with the family without putting your hands over little eyes and ears. I am positive you'll get a chuckle out of this one."
5,Topper is Tops!,"... it's become my favorite video. Joan Blondell and Carole Landis--the ""poor man's Betty Grable""--are great as the two party gals who go to a spooky old mansion to claim the inheritance that Landis has been awarded. Billy Burke as Mrs. Topper is a scream and so is her side-kick maid, Patsy Kelly (no one could do a double-take better than patsy) and Rochester, as Cosmo Topper's man servant is hysterical. The beautiful camera-work, the women's gowns, the top-notch special effects and the hysterical sight-gags ranks this with the best of Abbott and Costello comedies. A terrific excuse to while away an hour and a half when you're feeling down or bored. Best Scene: the playful seal and Rochester."
5,topper returns,"What can I say, my wife and I love these types of old movies. Its great to get out of the every day stress and have a few laughs."
5,Topper Returns,"Topper Returns was great clean fun. The actors were great. I loved every minute of the movie. My only complaint was a film problem with a short section of the tape itself. It in no way reflected on the quality of the acting, the problem was a bad tape."
5,Wonderful!,"I love this movie! I hadn't seen it in years, but remembered loving it, so today I watched it. I love it. It's funny, mysterious, and dramatic. Plus it's always nice to watch an oldie and realize how different they are from today's. I would definately reccomend this!!"
4,music for piano and drums,"this music is a must listen for people who are piano's lovers and appreciators. the music that stimulatives, bring relaxation and brillian all at onces"
1,NO!!!!!!!,THIS TOY ISNT APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR GROWING CHILDREN AS THEY TEND TO SEND THE WRONG MESSAGETO CHILDREN(OR AT LEAST MOST)THAT CHILDREN SHOULD DRESS LIKE US BRATZ. NO! PARENTS SHOULDN'T ALLOW THEIR KIDS TO DRESS LIKE SLUTS SO DON'T BUY THIS DOLL! THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING IS THAT THESE DOLLS ARE IN THEIR BABY STAGE OR ATLEAST SO BUT THEY DARE DRESS SO SKANKILY!
2,Bratz babyz are OKAY,A lot of people say that these bratz babyz are sooooooooooo cute but I don't think that they are that cute.My cousin Emily just got Bratz big babyz Cloe and she kept telling me and my sister that it was sooooooooooo cute.I think the baby was okay but it wasn't wonderful and she even asked me where the nose was because it was soooooooooo small.A lot of kids say that they are cute but the bratz babyz don't even have real hair and there eyes are huge. I think a lot of people just like them because they are bratz because if MyScene made the same babies that bratz did a lot of kids wouldn't even buy the MyScene babies.So kids need to stop saying there cute because if MyScene made the same babies kids that hate MyScene would say the babies were ugly.
1,No Thanks-But Barbie is Cool!,"I like baby dolls, but not this one. I love Phoebe and Roxxi, so maybe I would get the big baby versions of those, but no other big Bratz babyz. This doll is not soft, so so much for hugging and cuddling it. It's kind of cute, but I would get big baby Phoebe and Roxxi only.As for your FALSE LIES about Barbie, people are still buying them, Mattel HAS NOT given up, and Barbie will still be aroundfor years to come! I love both Barbie and Bratz and nothing willchange that!"
1,the baby wears thong panties!!!,"My 5 year ol got this for her b-day. The pig-tails pop off her head easily, and under her way to short hoochie mama skirt, she was wearing a black see through mesh thong!!! This toy is obviously not meant for any child who has morals and values."
2,this toy is NOT a baby:(,"this toy is cute but... NASTY! a baby dosn't look like that and... even a 16 year old wouldn't wear that crap! this toy is kind of cute but not for a little girl.IF YOU WANT YOUR DAUGHTER TO BE A STRIPPER, THEN BUY THIS TOY!"
4,what do you expect?,"It's a bratz babyz doll. It is what it is! Much less skanky than regular full-size bratz. My 8 year old loves it and most of her fellow 2nd grade girl friends have these dolls too. Seems VERY durable, I would be totally comfortable giving this to a 4 or 5 year old."
1,Babyz? An adult wouldn't even wear that outfit!,"Are you seriously trying to tell me that this is a baby? A 15 year old wouldnt even wear that slutty clothes. Nor would a 20 or 30 year old! Do you seriosly want your kids to have this toy, and start to dress just like the ""baby?"" If you do, then go ahead, waste your money and your kids life. Plus these are the most discusting and ugly looking toys i have ever seen. Someone really needs to sue the desinger of Bratz."
1,IS THIS THE MESSAGE YOU WANT TO SEND LITTLE GIRLS???,"This is the message you want to send to little girls???I HATE THIS DOLL! That shirt dosn't even cover up her navel! She is wearing a mini skirt for heavens sake! I got this doll for my 9th B-day from a friend and I thought I was going to barf. Hold on untill I turn 30. If you want your daughter, or friend to be a stripper, be my guest, but this is sending the wrong message to girls of all ages. She is also wearing a thong!! YUK!!!!!!!!"
5,How cute!,What agreat idea! Usually I absolutely Hate Baby Bratz Dolls But this is a doll you gotta buy! I'm countin on ya to buy the doll reader!
1,Thong on a doll recommended for a 3yr. old???,This is completely wrong. What type of person would give their 3yr old daughter a doll that is wearing thong underwear. I was blown away when I figured this out.Never would I recommend this doll!
1,i agree,i definetly agree with the person below me! It teaches kids to be like these dolls. Thats why i buy my daughter barbies and kellys and strawberry shortcake dolls. (by the way i am an adult not a kid i just dont have an acount :-)] i hope pretty soon the world will figure it out that bratz arent good for kids! mabye preteens and teens but NOT kids under 10. It just killed me too hear in the paper that barbie isnt getting bought any more and mattel has given up!!
1,trick sale,"This product is a 6inch caliper, they post 9 1/8 of the overall size of the piece, they have to specify what coustumers need to know."
3,"meh, so-so valve caps","they are not plastic, they are a recycled paper/plastic product, so they have no shine. I love the game of craps, and i got these to match my craps theme. they work and fit fine, just wish they had a sheen to them."
4,Good Triumphs,A delightful tale of the calamities that beset an 18th century English vicar. The story is fast moving and told with wit and humor. The language is archaic but this adds to the charm of the story rather than being an annoyance.
5,loverly story,"i found the book in a car boot sale it is over a hundred years old ,it was a bit hard with the text,being old ,i had to read the book twice for it to sink in ,what a story best one yet,especialy that it was written so long ago,i havent read the new version, but if its like mine you will enjoy it happy reading ."
5,BEAUTIFULY PUT TOGETHER!,"Her songs are beautiful they flow and the music and words are something you can relate to personliy i enjoyed it very much and you should listen and buy it. some songs that i really injoyed were white houses, annie & who's to say."
5,Another Great One!,"Vanessa has done it again! I have been listening to this CD almost non-stop since I picked it up today and I LOVE it! The songs are even better than the songs on the first album (my favorite CD of 2002). You can tell that she has matured as an artist and I can't wait for more. Make sure you check out ""Who's to Say"" it's great."
5,this album takes awhile to get used to,This is an even better album than Be Not Nobody - the lyrics and vocals and everything about it is superb! It's not radio-friendly pop like Be Not Nobody was. Fav songs on this cd are: Annie and Half A Week Before the Winter.
5,better and better,Vanessa has definitely changed and it shows in this incredible Cd. I havent taken this CD out of my player yet. It is quite different than her first.. but similar at the same time. The songs are deeper and darker.. this is very apparent later on in the disc. The content is very real .. nothing about this is fake or pretentious. This is a calm cd and moody as well.I saw Vanessa in concert 11-03-2004 at Joe's Pub... if you getta chance I recommend going to check her out.. shes unbelievable.If you like Vanessa's whole debut and not just 1000 miles.. then I think you'll love this cd as well. You can expect her material always to be true to who she is and not some industry garbage. If you truly appreciate piano and real vocals and true talent.. take a listen...
3,thoughts on harmonium:,"Vanessa carlton is 1 of my fav performers. I enjoy the 1st song white houses the most. the rest of the album is quite dark in sound to her last 1. however, if you are a fan, I recommend you add it to your collection!"
4,What?,What is all of this about a commercial? Don't be silly. Great work by a talented artist who still needs to grow a bit.
3,and a half...,"Somehow I managed to find a used copy of this before the actual release date (prompting curses from the indie store clerk, as it was a cd he was wanting!)... don't ask me how but it made me happy.The album is fun. Most of the songs are enjoyable in a pop way. The lyrics feel shallow, but they also feel innocent... even when they're not innocent subjects. And thankfully the music usually manages to match the innocent tone. It's definately not meant to be a serious album.""Harmonium"" will probably end up being a fling cd... the sort that is enjoyable for a certain season in life but then can be moved on from and pulled out for nostaligic purposes. It won't, however, be an endearing classic."
4,Vanessa Carlton,"""Harmonium"" is obviously a great name for this album.It shows such a difference from her debut album ""Be Not Nobody"".Music ranges from 'Private Radio',which has a poppy,Hilary Duff like sound about dancing in the moonlight with some sort of fling,to ""Who's To Say"" which offers a deeper message, of falling in love at too young of an age.The best songs on this album are without a doubt ""C'est Lae Vie""(""This Is Life""),""The Wreckage"",and ""Papa"".Whether you like Avril Lavigne or Maroon 5 this album is for you."
4,Worth waiting for!,"I have been waiting for this CD for quite some time, and it was worth the wait. I think her first single ""White Houses"" is an awesome song, and the video is fun! She is very talented, and her growth as an artist is shown on this CD from her last one. In my opinion, there is still some room for growth though, as she continues to develop as an artist. Very much worth buying and listening to overall."
2,"beautiful piano, horrible voice",she sounds like ashlee simpson but over nice pianos. Maybe they both went to the same ballet school
1,Shallow little girl,"Carlton thinks she is so damn profound, oooooo you came up with one of the most self important pseudo intellectual album names ever in ""Be Not Nobody"" Be Not Nobody? Try ""Be not educated."" This girl is a shallow child, and it shows in her daft music. Just because you drop a name like Steinbeck in a song doesn't make you smart, or worldly. Here's a cookie, now shut up and go play with your even more narcissistic pseudo-intellectual boyfriend Johnny Third Eye Blind. These two are cut from the same lame ass hipster mold that you can find in any of the coffee shop of Berkeley, pontificating on their own genius and never realizing that they are not special no matter what people tell them. You want real ""intelligent"" music; try John Lennon or Tori Amos. Listening to Carlton's lyrical drivel is like grading a freshmen Philosophy paper, it's trite and irrelevant."
1,Vanessa is...,"One of the WORST vocalists out there today. I can't think of a more irritating ""singer"" than Ms. Carlton. Thankfully her latest CD bombed so hopefully I won't have to be subjected to her pre-school-like vocals."
5,wow,"Will and always will be a nessaholic forever. i love this album more then her first album..there seems to be a extra track on the european version of the album. Its called ""the streets have no name"". favourite tracks are white houses, whos to say, afterglow, san francisco, private radio and the streets have no name."
3,"""White Houses""","sweet innocent vanessa carlton? I think not. Analize White Houses.Hint hint, the boy was her first mistake. interesting topic to write about, but i thought she was so innocent."
5,harmonium reviewwwwwww!!,"this album is absolutely amazing! don't worry vanessa carlton i didnt rip you off! I heard the whole album on MSN then went to download the song called Who's to say. after that it was so amazing i went to buy the album! Now who says downloading is a bad thing after all :)anyway the piano is really cool. vanessa carlton is looking better than ever too. and the video inside the enhanced cd is absolutely amazing too! after watching it, it changed my impression of vanessa carlton and i respect her a lot as an artist.. thanks for the great music!-brandon"
5,Great Second Album!,"My daughter and I loved Be Not Nobody, and we love Harmonium too! My daughter hasn't stopped listening to the cd since I bought it, and neither have I. We strongly recommend it to everyone."
5,Harmonium: The Second Coming of Vanessa Carlton,"Harmonium is such an incredible record, and it completely exceeds my initial expectations for Vanessa Carlton's sophomore album. It is a little different from 2002's Be Not Nobody in the sense that we are allowed to take a deeper look into Vanessa's beautiful, and sometimes dark, soul. I would have to say that most of the treasures on this record are the more upbeat songs. Some of these songs that steal the show are the bittersweet White Houses, a summer song about friendship, love, and loss, and Who's to Say, a song about choosing between family and a relationhip. Also, though a little dark, Annie shines on Harmonium. If you are not already a Nessaholic, you will be once you hear this talented ivory tickler show off her gift. Harmonium is in stores now, so go out and pick it up now!"
5,Vanessa Carlton's Harmonium,"This is the best album I've heard in a LOOONG time. I love the energy of ""Private Radio"", the beautiful reflectiveness of ""White Houses"", and the sarcasm of ""Ces't La Vie"". I recommend this to anyone who wants music that's real and isn't poppy fake. :)"
4,Harmonium !!,I just got this cd for Christmas and its real good ! I didnt expect this from Vanessa ! Its way better than the first one ! But there is some songs that I dont really like ! But i guest those song will grow up on me and ill love them !! You definitly have to buy it ! WOOT For VaneSsa!
4,Harmony Ridden,"This is one of those ""I bought the first one--liked it--but will I like the next"" cd's. But I took a gamble, purchased it, and I'm glad I did. Harmonium is a total mood piece. It puts you in this dark place with hope on the horizon. Like a million beams of sunlight streaming through. White Houses is plain fun ear candy. And San Fransisco is intelligent, catchy, and moving all at the same time. Vanessa pounds on the piano with such fervor in some songs, you feel like she's moving mountains. Then touches the keys so lightly you barely hear the melody. A grand album. Two times the charm."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,It sounds somewhat incomplete and boring to me to listen similar kind of tunes through out the whole thing. Still better than figure head type musician but not as good as I hoped. Felt this is the limit of her or the producer so I don't plan to buy next album if same producer.
1,Shameless Self-Promoter,She's featured on Time Warner cable commercials in West Tennessee. Her voice is actually quite irritating and the fact she is promoting this CD on an ad in this manner is a huge turn-off.
1,I gave it a chance but....,"The only reason I am writing this is because of that Time Warner commercial that keeps playing on TV was driving me insane! Now I mute the sound every time it comes on. I kept thinking, ""Why are they showing this local musician on this ad?"" Then I found out VC is a very popular singer, so I gave this CD a chance by listening to the preview clips above (maybe the ad did not do her justice, I thought). Well, the same weak,thin, and out-of-tune voice is still there. If you're over 14 years old and like this music, consider yourself tone-deaf (I'm a classically trained guitarrist who has played longer than VC has been alive, BTW). I think she does have some ability on the piano (I'm assuming that's her on the piano), though."
1,I don't get it.,"all right. i admit it. i don't get it. i had never heard of her before that irritating commercial started airing 500 times a day. i keep the remote handy just so i won't hear her bland, uninspired, amateurish rendition of a great stones song. this cd is all fluff. where's the emotion? what, does her dad own the studio?"
1,Horrible!!,"If Vanessa plays piano and sings like she does on the Time Warner Cable commercials, than she has a lot of practicing to do."
5,Take a Look,"`The Looking Book' is the perfect title for this cute story about a boy looking for his cat. Young readers will have a great time helping Ned look for Pistachio through twenty-eight pages of colorful, collage-style illustrations.""Of course you know it's not much funTo lose a cat upon page ONE.""The rhyme and rhythem in this book make it perfect for reading out-loud while the kids search the page for Pistachio. They'll find him popping out of a cupboard door, disguised as a castle guard or camelphloged in a monkeys cage. Of course Ned never seems to see him and enlists the help of a courtly queen, a memory-challenged old man and a faithful horse (who eventually gives up on page twenty-six). This book is a fun adventure with great giggle potential."
1,HATE IT,The cover of this CD is misleading. The songs are not the ones listed. I am very disappointed with this purchase.
2,Didn't receive the product I was viewing,"There are two photos here. One, with the authentic head band and the other, comparing the bootleg version with the authentic one. Here's the problem... I was hoping to receive the authentic one but turned out to get the bootlegged one. I'm not very happy with it but I'm not planning to use it for cosplay or something of that nature. Still would've been better to get the better looking one."
3,false picture,the picture that was given was not the correct picture it fooled me into thinking it was the dark blue bandanna. I am not happy with the material at all.
1,PIECE OF S***!!!,"I thought this was suppose to be the authentic headband, instead they sent a bootleg one that looks like s**t!! My 4 year old cousin could make a better looking bootleg headband than this.save your money and buy some sheet metal, get someone to cut it, then get them to imprint the symbol and scratch, then glue it on to some black faric"
3,My Headband That I'm Way Too Excited About,Its a little smaller than I thought it would be and it really has to be bent into shape before you can use it. If not it sits awardly on your head and is uncomfortable to wear. Also its definatly a novelty item. Anyone who is looking for athentisty should look further. But if ur a geeky little twerp like me who has an unhealthy attatchment to a certain rouge ninja you'll love it. I wore it for halloween and I felt the coolest nerd ever. All my friends were jealous :p
1,Thank you Shoryuken.,"Well, the title says it all. I almost bought this because I received a bootleg one with the complete costume. Guess I'll look somewhere else."
5,A guide for those coping with repeated harassment,"Detective Mike Proctor teaches readers the basics of defending themselves in How To Stop A Stalker, a guide for those coping with repeated harassment by potentially violent individuals. From why stalkers follow their victims; to what to do if one is being stalked; the collection of evidence; getting the justice system on one's side; what to do in court, and so much more, How To Stop A Stalker is an absolute ""must-read"", and bears the very highest recommendation for men and women alike -- because statistical data indicates 1 out of 12 women and 1 out of every 45 men will be stalked in their lifetime. In our troubled times of having to also deal with the threats presented by domestic and foreign terrorism, How To Stop A Stalker is even more relevant to the lives of ordinary citizens and could well save your life and the lives of those dear to you."
5,If you are being stalked you need this book,"Mike Proctor demonstrates that he understands the issue of stalking completely. This is the best resource I have found to facilitate effectively working with law enforcement and prosecutors and using the criminal justice system to protect victims from their stalkers. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about stopping their stalker or stalkers. Stand up and fight these bullys - stop living in fear, believing that you are powerless to stop them. You can do it!"
5,Calming and Aromatic,"Heat these in the microwave and have them set out where you are going to sit watching TV while you moisturize your hands after a paraffin dip.After dipping your hands, you can then place them in a plastic liner or plastic bags work well too. Then, place your hands into these mitts.Your moisturizing results will double when you continue to heat the paraffin on your hands. Spas tend to use electrically heated mitts, but these don't need to be plugged in and are also calming and aromatic because of the herbal mixture inside the gloves.~The Rebecca Review"
5,WOW!! GREAT CD CLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY,"My goodness, this is a WONDERFUL cd, I would HIGHLY recommend Clay Aiken!!!!"
5,REFRESHING!!!,"I decided to ""go for it"" and take the plunge and buy this CD not knowing what to expect. Let me tell you, I AM SO GLAD I DID! I absolutely LOVE this CD. Clay's voice is incredible and the music is so relaxing. It is the best album I have bought in a long time. My 5 kids even like it ; ) You will not be disappointed if you love Clay Aiken's voice."
5,RUDE,"Dork Rock...Please keep your cruel, gross and nasty remarks off here. You show your real character and it is so totally opposite of Clay and his fans. Grow up and find another web page to be so rude. We all wish Ruben well but PLEASE, children read these reviews and it is just not appropriate. I happen to think Clay is one of the best vocalist's to come along in many many years..and it is my right to have that opinion, as it is the right of others to respond positively to those singers they enjoy."
5,Clay knows how to do it!,how can anyone use words to describe clay?? WOW!!! i can listen to his songs over and over and over again!
5,Best Pop Album of the Year!,"This is easily the best pop album of 2003. This CD showcases Clay's amazing voice with catchy pop tunes and beautiful ballads. I absolutely love this album -- every song!One of the amazing things about Clay is that my 18 year old daughter and my 68 year old father love him, too! Very few of today's artists have such wide appeal."
5,Even more than I expected!,If this doesn't go platinum quickly I will be surprised. I don't think I can say enough about this album. It's just great!
3,Will The Real Clay Aiken Please Stand Up?,"I am a huge fan of Clay Aiken, but this cd lacks the vocal power that made me come to love his super power voice and soulful range. There are only hints of that on this album. None of this is Aiken's fault. It sounds like the sound mixers and engineers took Clay's voice and put it in a blender and then covered it up with loud instruments. Aiken is a tenor. He seems to be kept inside of a little box, unable to use his full range. He is very capable of using his deep, rich lower register and also very capable of belting out a song with the best of them. There are great hints of Aiken's full range through his throaty growls and power notes. The best songs on this are Perfect Day, Touch, Measure of a Man, No More Sad Songs, When You Say You Love Me(which should be a country music lovers dream), and I Survived You(which is very well written lyrically)."
5,Measure of a Man,"This is a fantastic first album for the ""real"" winner of American Idol. This album has none of the American Idolish songs and Clay's vocals are outstanding. This album will set a record for one of the quickest selling albums in music history. Don't delay -- get your copy now!!!"
5,Clay is a one of a kind!,"I love this CD. the song ""measure of a man says it all!"" There are so many people out there that judge people for what they have an not who they are. All of Clay's songs touch your heart! FINALLY someone that is in the spotlight that doen't dress and act like trash! He said ""I will never do anything that I would that I would be ashamed of"". There are not to many performers out there these days that can say that! He is a one of a kind! He has a truly loving and caring heart! Clay Aiken is what this world needs and this CD is the best CD I have heard in a LONG time! If I had kids I wouldn't be afraid for them to listen to it! Clay is the best! Keep up the great work Clay! And stay true to your heart!"
3,doesn't do him justice,"I really *Love* Clay but feel that this CD short changed his talent. His voice is incredible, but the music and lyrics lacked depth. Clay is so much more talented than this CD reveals and only his future ones will show this"
5,The Revolution has begun,"After all the hype and the anticipation leading up to this record, I was sure I'd be disappointed. However, after just one listen of the entire cd, I have never been more happy to have been proven wrong. This cd is fantastic! It is such a solid pop album! Every song is good...many boarder on great. He takes risks on some of the song selections, but he still manages to give the fans what they want and love. Is there a slight element of ""cheese"" to the cd? Sure, but if anyone can pull it off, it's Clay Aiken. He pours his heart and soul into each song, and, just like AI2, he makes you feel like he's singing each song just for you. Bravo, Clay! You've made your fans proud, and you left us all begging for more! Can't wait to hear the next one!"
5,Measure of a Man,I find that the judges on American Idol got it ALL WRONG!!! They chose Ruben because they thought he could hold the attention of the people buying the CD's. They were also wrong with Kelly Clarkson. Clay has a voice that crosses all lines and he can sing any song put in front of him and his new CD shows that TALENT. Ruben can only sing one style of song and that will be his undoing. I see CLAY around ten years from now and Ruben a vast memory. I recommend this Album wholeheartdly and and glad that my kids can listed without fear of profanity and other vulgar words.
5,Bringing it back!,Clay's album 'Measure of a Man' is such a treat to listen to. Pop music has gone down hill in the past 10 years and it is so refreshing to be able to listen to Clay's voice and actually hear the way should be made. Let us hope that Clay will bring back the good ole music! The whole album is truly fabulous.
5,The REAL American Idol,"I am so pleased with Clay's CD! I had no idea what to expect from this album; I just knew I wanted to support Clay (because he was my fav on American Idol). However, I was blown away by the songs and that wonderful voice of his!! My favorite songs are No More Sad Songs, Run to Me, Perfect Day, and Measure of a Man. This is not an album full of ballads - there is a lot of variety, but they all highlight Clay's amazing voice. Buy it - you won't be disappointed!"
5,Measure of a Man Clay Aiken,"This is a terrific CD. It is easy to listen to, has perfect songs, and makes you want to play it over and over again. Clay does a fantastic job. His voice is incredible with such power and range. All songs are unique to Clay and sang as only he can! AMAZING singer and fantastic songs! GET IT NOW!"
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"Aiken's fans have been building up for months about how great and fantastic his CD's going to be and that it'll sell multi-platinum copies, et al. Well, Gold is a more realistic view for the simple fact that his CD is just okay. I heard the whole CD at a ""hear it before you buy it"" music store - and I'm glad I did. I was only impressed by the song that was originally released as a singles i.e., This Is The Night. Well, at least he tried, but I'd just as soon spend my money on Neil Sadaka's Greatest Hits or Country Sensation LeAnn Rhimes upcoming CD."
1,Measure Of Bad Music,"Is the music business this desperate to go and sign this poor excuse for a musician to a record contract?A bad CD. Hey Clay, do us all a favor and retire right now, so our ears don't have to be polluted with this garbage any longer."
1,Horrible!,You must be joking. Clay Aiken looks like a fairy. Dresses like a fairy. Talks like a fairy. He looks like he is made out of clay. Ha! Ha! Voice is down right awful. CD is a mess. He is definitely a product of poor American TV and should not be given the oppurtunity to put out another wretched album. BLAH!
2,"Good Voice, But....","Let me just start by saying that I am formally educated in music. Unfortunately, I have the exact same criticism about Clay that many (including Simon) have. He's got a huge voice, but he lacks emotion. He can hit high notes, his voice has a richness, but obvious Clay knows nothing of what he sings about. Song stylists are able to show off their voices and make the audience feel it at the same time. That's the sort of thing that separates the Wayne Newton's from the Bruce Springsteen's....or the Kelly Clarkson's from the Sheryl Crowe's. Mr. Aiken just doesn't have that. Screaming out some notes is not singing, it's just plain screaming. And that's the reason he was voted number two and not number one on American Idol. It's not enough to hit notes, make me feel it...I want to feel what the song is saying. Otherwise, seeing or hearing you perform is not worth the price charged."
3,Listen before you buy!!,"I began watching American Idol because a coworker raved about Clay. I continued to watch because his voice was so beautiful it was heartbreaking. I waited for this CD and thank heaven I listened to clips first on the internet so I knew not to buy it.His glorious voice has been changed to a bland, ordinary, sounds-like-every-pop-star out there voice and the songs are only average. I was afraid RCA would do this to him.On the show, Clay had the kind of voice where the music was secondary, meaning you didn't care what he sang, you just wanted to hear the voice! On this CD the songs matter since the voice is only average if you don't like the songs there is no reason to buy.Listen to the song clips before buying!"
2,pls. try again next time,Just a reminder to Clay. if you want to succeed in the business as a respected singer and performer i suggest that you work w/ only the best composers and musical arrangers in the business.I have someone like David Foster in mind. Dianne Warren and even Jim Brickman.I don't want to see your talent go to waste.Think about it boy. you deserve the best and work w/ the best in the business.
1,Dull As Dishwater,"This album has got to be the most boring, unimaginative CD of the year. All of these five-star reviews are very misleading. I feel that most of them have been written by obsessed Clay fans who feel the need to heap praise on Measure Of A Man simply because ""It's Clay!!!"" Don't be misled! I wouldn't recommend buying this record for anyone as Christmas gift, unless you are trying to make an enemy. A better gift idea would be Speakerboxxx/The Love Below by Outkast, or Elephant by The White Stripes. Merry Un-Clay Christmas!"
1,Clay ? More like mud...,"I'm sorry to every Claymate out there but Clay Aiken isn't really my type. He's annoying, whiny, and not meaningful. It seems like hes marketing to 5th graders and his mom. Invisible is NOT a meaningful love song, its just pure pop. If you want to listen to meaningful male vocals, I would suggest Coldplay, Keane, or Alexi Murdoch.I do think that Clay Aiken has a good voice for Broadway or theater, but when he produces an over the top pop album such as this, he's wasting his talent."
1,Snore...ZZZZZZZZ,While Clay has a great voice this album was a total bore. Every song sounds exactly the same and I am glad I only listened to the album and didn't waste my money. There are about two good songs off the album and I am already want to puke from hearing one of them.
4,A Great First Album,"Dear Amazonians,I think Clay Aiken is a strong addition to the popular music scene. The combination of his youthful good looks and agile voice make for a great pop musician.On a technical note though, and the reason for my four-star rating, during the song ""When You Say You Love Me,"" we can hear Clay clear his voice at the two minute and forty-three second mark (2:43 on your CD player). This is a minor technicality though that I am sure Clay will overcome with his future releases. All-in-all, I think Clay Aiken is a very talented artist who will only improve with time.Go Clay!Take care,--Daniel"
5,Amazing,This CD is AMAZING there is something in it for everyone. Clay is SO talented and I'm glad that he uses it in a positive way. It is nice to finallly be able to look up to someone. THis album is probally the only TRULLY clean pop album that I have ever heard!!! This CD is so good. All the songs are GREAT!! Every song is different in it's own way. I totally give it 5 STARS!!
5,MUSIC Makes Sense,"I haven't had a CD that I haven't skipped tracks. Even if it's the best of. Clay Aiken had come up with BEST of CLAY on HiS FIRST RELEASE. It's combination of not just pop songs but mix of danceable tunes(Invisible), Country (Perfect Day), Oldies (I Will Carry You), Rock Ripped (No More Sad Songs), Sexy (Touch), Edgy and heart twisting(I Survived You). There is a story in every tract and Artist let's you be a part of that Journey. Fans and Avid Music Listener would not be disappointed. Why are you still reading.. GO BUY ONE and HEAR for YOURSELF."
5,measure of a man,"i couldnt wait for clays album to come out, and i was not disappointed. after listening to some of the garbage the music industry produces today, this album is one that i dont mind my kids listening to and this is an artist my kids can ""idolize"""
5,"A Must Have For Your ""Good Music"" Collection!","I was concerned about Clay's ability to enter into the pop world, given the songs we fell in love with on AI. My concerns were eliminated the second I pushed play. Amazing album, that captures many of his talents, without overdoing it. I was instantly captivated by the lyrics, the melodies. Absolutely love all but song No. 4. Highly recommend that you add this to you and your family's collections."
2,Talent without good songs.,"It is obvious that Clay Aiken has talent- there is no fooling about that. He is definitely one of the most talented pop stars out there right now. However, the people producing this album did a poor job showcasing the talent that Clay Aiken holds. Every song on this album sounds the same. The emotions portrayed by Clay are not very diverse; every emotion fits into either the category of ""I am singing about pain"" or ""We are going to get through the pain"". The truth is that this album is painful enough to actually sit and listen to. The only song on this less-than-quality debut that is worth listening to is the title track, ""Measure Of A Man."" This song is in a realm of its own, actually having a worthwhile message.In summation, the talent is there, the album is not. Maybe next time, Clay."
3,Better Luck Next Time,"C'mon Clay, we know you can do better than this CD. I had my calendar marked for the big release date, and couldn't wait to hear the vocals I'd been sincerely impressed with on the American Idol competition. The vocals are there, but the songs are wimpy--I've thought and thought about that word as the description, and that's as close as I can get. Wimpy--most of the songs sound alike, and seem to be the whining of someone left behind.There are a few cuts that display Clay's amazing talent, but on the whole, it seems as if no particular thought went into the choices of the material. Hopefully, when Clay is a bigger star and can pick and choose what to record, the selections will be better. Some of his best performances were when he shed the shy boy personna, and made us rock and roll. (Remember the red leather jacket?!?)Would I buy this again? Yes, I am still impressed with his talent. Would I buy his second CD if it contained the samekind of bland selections? No, sorry, not me."
3,Disappointing,"After having read some of the other reviews on this site, I was wishing that I could respond to this CD with the same kind of enthusiasm that others had. Unfortunately, determined as I was to love this CD, I was sadly disappointed. Someone made the decision that they were going to turn Clay into something he's not - a pop star - instead of letting him be what he is - an amazing voice. If you want to hear Clay's talent showcased, buy his ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" single. If you're looking for an album by an artist with a beautiful voice and a producer who really knows what he's doing, I would highly recommend Josh Groban."
2,Don't like the songs. They do not compliment Clay's voice.,Sorry. This CD was a great disappointment. The songs are terrible. These songs are not meant for Clay's voice. He needs to sing better songs than whats on this Cd. Where's the power of Clay's voice. He needs to pick his songs carefully in the future. Very disappointed with this one.
3,Not As Good As I Thought It Would Be,"The guy can sing however the material picked could have been better. Sounds like the 80's group Chicago sound for some reason to me. No real strong love songs here. Bridge over troubled water isnt on here and neither is On The Wings Of Love. Those both songs I think would have made cd somewhat better. I dont dislike it, it may take a while to grow on me thou."
3,Listen before you buy.,"If you think this is the same voice you heard on the show you're wrong. Somebody has turned that beautiful voice into a bland, ordinary one that sounds like any pop singer out there. On top of that the songs are as bland and ordinary as the voice and they all sound the same! On the American Idol show Clay had the kind of voice where the music is secondary, meaning you didn't care what he was singing you just wanted to hear the voice. On the CD you need to like the songs because there is no other reason to buy it.I gave it 3 stars since it is an average rating for a strictly average CD. If Clay had sung the way he sang on the show there wouldn't have been enough stars in the sky to rate it.Get the AI Christmas CD - he sings ""First Noel"" in the show voice, beautiful!!"
3,"Clay is great, songs are poor","As usual, Clay's voice mesmerizes me. I love to hear him sing, no matter how poorly written a song is. I am not impressed with the producer's song choices, but we can't fault Clay for that. He sings them wonderfully. I recommend the album if you enjoy Clay's voice, but not if you're looking for songs that leave a lasting impression. Hopefully his next album will be better chosen. Perhaps the ""rush"" to get this one out impacted those selections. I look forward to his future works. He is quite the talent!"
1,Of couse he's number one!,"Most Clay fans are buying from 2 - 10 copieseach to help boost his sells! This isunfair giving us a false number of peopleactually buying! But how else can theykeep him in that number one spot withthat slop! Yeah,he's number one all right!A one star rating!!!!"
1,Fantastic,Every song in the album is wonderful and he has such a beautiful voice. I never tire of listening to it.
2,Disappointed in California,"I eagerly awaited the release of this album, but was quite disappointed when I heard it. Other than This is the Night, the remaining songs are very plain and quite forgettable, and you will have a difficult time not skipping ahead to the next song in hopes of something better. I can't help but feel that the album was rushed to market, and that in doing so, good song choices were not made. The songs simply do not showcase Clay's singing ability and range, and many of their lyrics and melodies leave a lot to be desired. I wish I could have written a wonderful review, but unless your an absolute Clay diehard fanatic, I think that you will be disappointed with this album."
5,Wow,This CD is a must buy. Doesn't these songs sung by Clay Aiken already show that HE was supposed to win American idol? I give this cd a 5 stars. AMAZING! I can't wait till his next album
5,A New Pop King Has Been Crowned!!,"Clay Aiken is everything the music world has been searching for! He has morals that equal his dynamic vocal range. From the beginning note of ""Invisible"" to the ending note of ""Touch"" Clay Aiken brings you into a world where good things do happen to the nerdy guys and the runner-up does finish 1st! If you are searching for a true pop superstar...you will find him in Clay Aiken. Every word of every song comes from his heart and can actually be understood! This guy is awesome and I congratulate him on his outstanding 1st album!"
5,"Not bad, not bad at all!","This album is flawed, but is still excellent for a freshmen album. The songs have great lyrics and catchy tunes. This is not boyband. Boybands couldn't sing their ways out of a paper bag and all their lyrics contain may 5 words at the most. Clay actually can sing WELL and his songs are meaningful, especially MOAM. You get a variety from teen pop (Invisible) to rock (I Will Carry You, No More Sad Song, I Survive You) to even Beatlesque (Shine) and SALSA (Touch)!! Of course there are the beautiful ballads too. Get this CD, you won't be dissappointed."
5,Measure of a Man,"I first fell in love with Clay's voice on American Idol. He has a rich, powerful voice with a wide range. I think he can take almost any song and make it sound wonderful. I think he proved that on American Idol. His voice is appealing to people of all ages. I am 62, my Mother is 86, my four daughters are ages 33 to 39, my granddaughter is 12, and we all love his voice and music. My husband is 63 and he admires him as a wonderful, refreshing new talent with a marvelous voice. I loved his CD, Measure of a Man, so much I bought 10 of his CD,s to give as Christmas gifts. I wanted to share something I loved with someone I love. May God continue to bless him and enrich his life. May he always stay the wonderful wholesome young man he is today. That's my Christmas wish for him."
5,That's the most inaccurate review ever by Jaan,"There is no way that Amazon's reviewer can compare Clay to talentless boybands that rely on catchy background music and over-exaggerated dance moves to move CDS. Clay has real talent, something that boybands sorely lack. Even Ruben Studdard, the American Idol champion cannot come close to Clay in terms of voice quality and pure singing talent. IMO, Clay deserves his success, this is a fabulous CD by a very talented singer. And his performance at the American Music Awards was simply stunning, why else would some members of the audience give a standing ovation? Remember that the audience was made up of singers and entertainment industry people, and i'm pretty sure they weren't applauding Ruben's performance, good as it may have been, Clay was just simply spectacular. A great singer and a great CD, they don't make singers like this anymore."
5,Measure of A Man,"I love this album! In order, my favorites are: Touch, Measure of A Man, No More Sad Songs, I Will Survive You and Invisible. In my opinion, these showcase his voice the best."
2,clay has done better,I like clay. But I was not to thrill with this cd. Rueben seem to be more impressive
4,I'm a Purist!,"Clay has THE voice and it is an awesome gift. The studio/production sound is not. Clay's voice comes through despite the over-production of this cd. This over-production sound (they say ""music""?) make so many cds the same. I would love to hear him sing with more simplistic background music, letting his voice carry the songs. Pure Clay! I wonder what type of cd Neil Sedaka would have (or still might?) produce for Clay. Yes, I was looking forward to the complete Clay-rendition of ""Solitaire.""All in all, this is a GREAT CD, especially for his first one. I admire his morality and greatly appreciate a cd that I can listen to with anyone w/o concern for the lyrics. Thanks, Clay!!! I look forward to your next cd...and your next...and your next......"
5,AWESOME!,"WOW THIS CD IS AMAZING! I WOULD BUY 700 OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE SO GOOD! I LOVE CLAY AIKEN! THIS CD BLEW ME AWAY! WOW, WHAT A VOICE!"
5,Clay come through with a Strong Breakout CD,"This CD definitely secures Clay a place in the music industry. He has strong vocals, that would make you think he's been in the music business MUCH longer than American Idol has been on TV. Clay is a singer who has a future, keep watching, he is already good, and will likely get better."
4,Clay Aiken can sing...but not top 40!,"I'll admit that Clay Aiken can sing. There's no doubt about that. But the question on everyone's mind (as was on Simon Cowell's during the second season of American Idol: The Search for a Superstar) is does Aiken really have a voice for pop music? I agree with Cowell: His voice tends more to the Broadway musicals than to actual top 40 chart-topping. His debut is solid, though. I think he should've won the second season - he had the more distinct voice. MEASURE OF A MAN measures up...but just."
2,Darn!,"I really wanted to enjoy this cd, but as many times as I have listened to it......I just cant. Yes, Clay has a good voice, but I hear no emotion in it. Maybe a better choice of songs for his voice would help. I feel, in time, he will mature into a more rounded performer."
1,*1/2 stars,"I didn't care much for Clay on AI (or Ruben, for that matter), but I got the CD anyway since he has a really good voice. Well, there are a couple good songs on this CD, such as ""Invisible"", although some of the lyrics are weird (""if I was invisible then I could just watch you in your room""), ""No More Sad Songs"", and the chorus to ""I survived you"". Overall, though, I didn't really care for the CD. If you were a fan of him on the show, you'll definitely like this album."
2,Middle of the Road,"Invisible is the only song on this cd that is any good,my wife loves Clay,but I always tell her he won`t be around long and neither will American Idol.as far as easy listening goes it is pleasing enough but don`t look for any rock n roll here."
1,THIS IS ATROCIOUS!,"my God! this actually gets zero stars!!! how can anyone listen to this schlock?!?! clay aiken sounds exactly like the backstreet crossed with whitney houston. a CD full of sorry sounding pop hooks and soppy balladry is just absolutely aweful! if you want some good pop hooks and ballads, then get simon and garfunkle instead. and if you feel like some soppy balladry then get david bowie's ""hunky dory""...just make sure you pass on this true piece of crap of an album...seriously, this sucks really really bad"
1,Could this be worse?,"Without the studio trickery, he would be doing community college musicals. The make-over doesn't do it for me either. I wouldn't spend the money and I'd give it away if it were given to me. What new lows will America's talent standards slip to?"
2,Total shock,"Don't belive the hype. 2 good tracks, one being the single Bridge Over Troubled Water. He is so talented but this cd is baaad. What happened? I loved him on the show, but the song choices are lame to say the least. Maybe the next one will be better. Better to burn than to buy this one."
2,Material on this CD is below par!,"I was very disappointed in this first CD from Clay. There is still nothing wrong with his voice, which I admired from the beginning of his appearance on American Idol. But the songs on this effort are rather ordinary, if not downright boring. I would have enjoyed more covers of older or modern standards, such as the effort he made on ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"". He deserves better management!! His voice talent deserves a far better team behind it. I hope future outings have material up to his capabilities."
1,Why?!,"Who buys and listens to his stuff?! I got this CD as a gift and must say I was very disappointed to hear that this is what America likes? His voice sounds so average ""broadway musical"" and not outstanding at all. My bet is he can thank American Idol that he sells any albums at all."
2,Disappointing,"Having watched Clay really get deep in his singing on American Idol, I expected much more from him than he delivers on this CD. The arrangements are weak, his singing is shallow, and the songs all sound the same. For a person of such depth and range in his songs, this is a very poor compilation. I am vastly disappointed."
3,Clay deserved better material to sing!,"I have enjoyed Rubens and Clays Tv performances equally both. They both had something different to offer. Unfortunatelly Clay got stuck with not the greatest composers for this album. Yes they are catchy fun tunes, but that is not something Clay deserves. He needs songs that are not your average pop radio hits. Clay has a voice for better quality songs. Although I do enjoy listening to this album I have to say that it was rushed and not intended for Clay to perform. On the other hand Rubens cd is prety close to a perfection I will not have time to post review for him but it would say 4 to 4 1/2 stars. I hope that for his next album Clay will get lucky and get the right composer for his songs."
1,American idle is more like it...,"Clay Aiken has to be one of the worst singers ever to come off of American Idol. The songs on his debut CD are all predictible and sleep-inducing. Even William Hung is capable of making a better CD than this drab garbage. With boring singles like ""Invisible"" and ""The Way,"" I can't understand how Americans could make this guy a star. Please, Clay, if you insist on making more music, at least have the decency of doing a nice gay anthem like ""I Will Survive"" or ""YMCA."""
4,A pretty good premier CD,"After waiting patiently for Clay's premier CD I was fairly please with the results although I was not fond of the recording sound itself. I think a better job could have been done to bring out that fabulous voice. Plus, they could have mixed it up a bit. All of them had the same basic theme.Out of the 12 tracks, I liked 9 of the songs. Not crazy about I Survived You, Perfect Day or Touch. My favorite ones are Invisable, I will Carry You and No More Sad Songs besides This is the Night.I really think that he sings better live (and that's a talent in itself) but I think this CD is pretty good. I was hoping that they would have included Solitaire. Hopefully, he will do that in a furture CD. All in all, I would recomend it."
4,No Stopping Him,"Love his singing or hate his singing, he is on his way to the top and there is no stopping him."
3,Disapointment,"Love the artist - big fan. Hate the CD, did not give Clay the opportunity to best showcase his talent. Not the best composed songs."
5,DHGM,"CLAY IS THE BEST I'VE HEARD IN YEARS. I just love his voice. It's clear and he sings soooooooo well. Love his album. I'm sooooooooo happy he sold over 600,000 in a week. Wish him the best in the future. I excited for him to do another album in the future. His voice is the best."
2,Not good enough,"I feel that with Clay's incredible range, he can do far better. This CD is too unimaginative and bland. I'm returning mine unopened. Sorry, Clay, better luck next time."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Clay Aiken has an incredible voice, and his performance is mesmerizing. But Clay's voice is overwhelmed by backup singers and instrumentation; that voice of his certainly should be the star of any production, not a secondary feature.Also, the songs on this CD sound like all other pop music to me; I'd like to hear more mature choices in the next CD (a la Josh Groban)."
3,Surprisingly Good!!!,I wasn't a big fan of Clay during AI2 but my friend played the album for me and I bought it the next day. Clay's voice doesn't sound so wierd and broadway once recorded and I really enjoy most of the songs. Invisible is the best song on the album closely followed by measure of a man and no more sad songs. The album does get a bit samey if you listen to the whole thing through but overall a good album and hopefully he'll get a bit more variety on his next album.
3,"It's good, but not great!","After listening to the CD, I was a little disappointed. I think some of the songs were flat and didn't allow Clay to optimize his tremendous voice range. I think it probably was rushed. I wish ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" was included on it as well."
2,Disapointing,"Obviously people voted for Clay Aiken based his incredible covers of good songs during the competition, and a teenager wouldn't have been too familiar with alot of those songs because they we're often classic oldies. But for some reason they have decided to make him put out this cd full of the kind of songs that teenagers will probably go for and is nothing like what he had sung to win votes and gain the oppurtunity to make this cd in the first place. So I lost out and I can't understand why they did that. I just hope his next cd has a wider musical range."
1,a disappointment for a HUGE Clay fan!,"I was a HUGE Clay fanatic throughout all the AI hype. I fell in love with his voice and his personality and dashing good looks. However, this CD disappointed me. The voice that I fell in love with was his ""live"" voice, and I don't like his ""studio"" voice very much. I like 2 or 3 of the songs on the cd, but it makes me sad to give it a bad review, because I was looking forward to this cd since May."
4,Great Album. I love it.,"I've been looking forward to hearing this album for months. I love it! Clay sounds wonderful. Shine, Perfect Day, and Measure of a Man are probably the most well-written and well developed as far as production and writing on the album, but some of the 'lighter' pop material like Run to Me and Touch are incredibly sensual and full of yearning just the same. I could hear Run to Me on a movie soundtrack. There are a few specific production moments that are lame-that seem to be 'riffing' just to try to fit in more with what's out there and it doesn't quite work, but it only happens on Invisible and Touch. Overall, I really, really LOVE this album and I think harder rock, alternative music listeners would too. Several of the songs appeal to an alternative audience-people just have to get past the fact that Clay didn't write them himself, but he sure does sing the hell out of them. I'm thrilled that RCA found a balance between American Idol Clay and Recording Artist Clay. LOVE IT!"
4,Middle Aged Crazy for Clay,"O.K., maybe I am getting old! I was always a rock and roll girl. Give me the Stones or Zeppelin over Manilow or Diamond any day, any way!! But this kid rocks!! I was a Reuben fan at first American Idol glance, but Clay won me over with his song selection, poise and incredible voice. This album would have been better with a stronger producing team, but hey! good first effort. Rock on, Clay!!"
4,An overpackaged gift,"Five stars for Clay, three for RCA.Clay's debut album has the same problem as his single--it's overproduced, and he is overpackaged. He sounds too boy-band-pop-star-ish to me (more nasal-y head voice than full-throated and chesty like he sounds on his demos).On the other hand, the song choices are good for him and go well together. There is integrity in the album itself, and I think he has a right to be proud of it. Overall, though, I think he's more of a live-in-person performer than a studio performer. He gets energy from his audiences, and his singing is a gift to them.Hopefully Clay will find a way to integrate his love for both music and teaching. The next Mr. Rogers? I'd gladly enroll in the School of Clay."
5,As great as I expected,"Clay Aiken has an amazing God given gift! All of his songs are well done and decent songs. They have nice lyrics that in no way would offend anyone. As a mother with small children, I would recommend this to everyone! Clay's phenomenal voice is one I could listen to every day, and have ever since getting the CD last Thursday! He has amazing range and diversity! Do yourself a favor and buy this one!"
5,Great cd!,This is a great cd. Clay's voice is wonderful and the songs really grow on you. The people that gave this cd a bad review were either tone deaf or are Ruben fans that are upset because Clay will sell more cds then Ruben. Clay should have been the American Idol winner and the sales will prove it.
5,great pipes,Clay Aiken's great set of pipes and classic style are a win/win for this CD. The CD has a variety of songs in different styles and is appealing to all ages.
5,Clay is awesome once again!,"What a performance!!! Clay sang ""Invisible"" in 2003 and then ushered in the new year with ""The Way"" from his CD Measure of a Man on MTVs 2004 show. He was totally awesome! Even though Clay has not personally written these songs, like on AI-2 he takes them and makes them his own!Way to go Clay in 2004!!! I would buy this CD"
5,My BEST Christmas gift,"I received this CD as a gift for Christmas, and all I that I can say is WOW! Whenever I had the chance, I listened to Clay during the American Idol competition and my opinion was that he should have won.I enjoy all of the songs that are on this CD, but my favorites are ""The Way,"" ""Invisible,"" ""I Survived You,"" ""Measure of a Man,"" and of course, the smash single from the summer, ""This is the Night."" I can't wait to wear out this CD in my cars CD player and my CD player at work. No worries though, if I wear out this CD I will just buy another one!Buy this CD, because IT IS EXCELLENT! No one else out there even comes close to the talent of Clay Aiken. He will be around for a long time to come!Oh, and Janet, thanks for giving me this wonderful CD! :)"
4,Love him!,"clay's awesome, and he's only gonna get better, his next album will prove that i'm sure, and hopefully it will show off a little more of his voice, maybe throw in a few acappela songs, that would be great, anyway if you like clay you'll like this, and even if you don't like him yet you just might after listening"
2,"Not ""electrifying"" Clay, but ""electrified"" Clay","The most enduring criticism of ""commercial pop"" music is that by the time the producers get done with their electronica and multiple tracking, the singer gets lost in the shuffle. Such is the case here. The Clay Aiken with the dazzling talent and soaring high notes that we loved on American Idol is buried in a sea of ""production"" so that the album becomes another of so many that literally ""anybody"" could have sung. I guess we'll have to wait until he's proven he can sell enough ""commercial mainstream"" to take the ""risk"" of a ""Broadway"" album, or to sing the the hard-to-sing oldies that he became famous for on AI.Love ya Clay, just not this album."
4,Miss Clay's vocal range..,"Some other reviewer posted that people are saying negative things or critiquing his album just due to CNN's comments. Clay is not perfect nor is his record company but it is a great album and I find myself going to back to the orginal A I tapes I have just to hear him sing out the songs like ""Everlasting Love"" and ""BOTW"" to hear that amazing range. Thats all."
5,Clay Aiken Has The Voice Of A Lifetime,"I love this CD and couldn't wait for it to come out. I have loved Clay's voice from the first AI tryout. It just seems that anything he sings becomes a beautiful song. I have listened to the first CD so much my family is ready to kick me out. They are just glad I am playing a new one. This CD has great songs that any age can listen to. I just wish they would stop putting so many back up singers, and loud music to back him. We want to hear Clay. We don't want anything so loud that you can't hear that beautiful voice on it's own. He has such a stong voice - he doesn't need all the stuff many singers use - to make them sound good. He is all class and I will love him forever."
1,You've Got to be Kidding,"For all those who compare Ruben and Clay, there is no comparison. Ruben won b/c he is a true talent. While Clay had to be ""made over"", Ruben is still Ruben. I listened to Clay's first 5 songs and had to turn it off. While he can sing other peoples songs well he cannot hold a tune to his own album. I was extremely disappointed, and would not buy this CD."
1,Overrated,"Give me a break. I do not see what all the fuss is about. I listened to this CD and although Clay sings well, the songs are boring ballads and they all sound the same. I agree with all the negative reviews from the media. This album is nothing to get excited about and I sure wouldn't waste my money on it. You'll get more for you money with Josh Groban's new CD."
1,What is the world coming to?,Clay Aiken stinks! He is a manufactured 'pop star' whose facial expressions on American Idol made him look constipated!These songs are cliched and over-sung. Let's hope Ruben's effort is better than this sentimental rubbish
1,"MANILOW ""WANNABE""","Okay, Clay Aiken may be a dork in person, but the fact of the matter is he won runner up in American Idol and can sing, and that's about it.When I saw him on American Idol, I was disgusted! Clay sings cheesy awful ballads that make you want to hit the ""mute"" button on your remote. What's even more disgusting is his God-awful wardrobe! The fact that so many teenage girls out there are so in love with Clay makes me want to vomit!!! This music is for nerds only! GET REAL!!!!"
5,Beautiful!,"I rooted for Clay all throughout American Idol 2 and knew that his CD would be amazing. I listened to this CD and was not disappointed a bit. His voice is so beautiful, and the songs are very very well written. Great Job Clay! Thankyou for sharing your incredible talents with the world."
4,Sounds like an Opera singer trying out pop...,First off let me say that I listen to all types of music...I really liked Clay on American Idol so I decided to give his new CD a try...It really seems like the studio guys have changed Clay's voice a little bit on the CD...He definitely sounded better on TV...It's kinda weird...All of the songs are perfectly written with great meaning and the music is top notch but it still seems like it his voice does not mesh or blend with the music...Does anyone else get this feeling ?? Anyway...I guess if you are a diehard Clay fan pick this one up...If not...defintely listen before you buy....
5,awesome!,"This CD really reflects the artist. Every track is excellent! If you are a Clay fan, I highly recommend this CD. If you aren't yet a fan, after hearing this you will be!"
5,A Winner,"Love Clay, love his incredible voice, love this CD. Each time I listen, I have a new favorite. Some songs inspire, some make me want to dance, and some just make me feel good. As a fan of all the old standards, easy listening, etc., a future album of all covers would be nice too. In fact, I believe I would be happy to hear Clay sing just about every song ever written."
5,MUST HAVE CD,"OH MY GAULD!!!!!!!!!! THIS CD IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!My mother, my daughter & myself can't get enough of it! This cd will be played for generations to come.Favorite...The Way."
5,FIVE STAR CD!,I LOVE THIS CD. A VERY REFRESHING AND UNIQUE SOUND FROM THE NEWEST SUPERSTAR IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY!
3,A really good pop cd!,"OK, I am more a rock fan than a fan of pop, but I think for a first cd Clay has come through with songs that utilize his obviously very gifted voice to great effect, and songs that his audience will surely identify with. There are traces of the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, and Elton John in these songs. My only complaint is that the drum mix could be a little stronger on most of these songs and maybe give them a little more ""pop"". That being said, the opening song ""Invisible"" is perfect pop, which means I can't get it out of my head. With all Clay has had going on in his life and the rush he had to make this cd, I think it is a fine effort (3 stars to me is a good rating)."
4,Clay does a great job on this CD in such a short time!,"I love Clay. Loved him on AI2, and I think he has loads of talent. I bought the CD the day it came out, and initially I liked it but thought all the songs sounded the same. Then I listened again...and again...and again...and it's now in my car, at work, and at home. I love this CD! Clay does a fine job with all of the songs, and although I was hoping for those stronger songs, vocally, this CD is a great example of Clay's style and personality. I am looking forward to buying Ruben Studdard's CD and comparing which CD I enjoy best. Oh, and I read the liner notes on Clay's CD and saw that Danielle Broisebois sings background vocals on a couple of Clay's songs, which are terrific and encouraged me to buy Danielle's older CD (Arrive All Over You) and I'm enjoying her vocals as well!"
5,Clay doesn't disappoint!,I had to buy two copies of this CD - one for my car and one for work because I can't stop listening to it. Clay's voice is wonderful and never faulters! I haven't stopped listening to it since it was initially released. I can't wait for the second one!
1,This sucks.,Why in the world did they record this mess? He was better doing that american idol material than this crap. Ugh save your money.
2,Superficial,"Ohh come on, tell me, how many variations can he make when he hits the high pitches? 1? Put the lousy production of this album aside, he sings worse than an amateur. His voice is sonorous, but the only thing he's good at is to show it, without any feelings whatsoever. Analogy: a fish that doesn't know how to use its fins to swim."
2,This album proves he is a runnerup,This Album is terrible. He took no chances. Forget the hype and this album. I wish the old napster was in business to save me from buying this album. I liked him on American Idol but this album and the media push to promote him over the real winner Reuben is terrible. Go Reuben - NO Clay
1,"UGH, yuck!","Not a very good album. Many of the songs put me to sleep half the time, and were just down right boring. In my opinion, Darren Hayes is much more interesting compared to Clay. If you want a good CD get something else, this one isnt worth the time or money."
1,"Go to Broadway, please!!!","While Clay Aiken does have an amazing talent for singing, he's album better suites middle-aged America instead of a younger, more ""poppy"" audience. I get irritated seeing people compare Ruben and Clay. They are in two totally different genres!"
2,Clay is too subdued,I was so disappointed in this album after hearing Clay's beautiful voice on American Idol. It's like the producers were trying to force Clay into some pop mold. I kept listening waiting for Clay to really let one loose and belt out a song. Didn't happen. Maybe the next album Clay can be Clay.
4,Clay Measures Up,"Clay Aiken makes a stunning debut on his first album 'Measure of a Man'. This CD sold over 600,000 copies in the first week of release in the USA, and it's easy to see why. Clay's vocals have to be heard to be believed. His version of the Neil Sedaka classic 'Solitaire' is amazing, and he makes this song his own. Other stand-outs are 'The`Way', 'Invisible', 'Run to Me', 'Perfect Day' and the title track 'Measure of a Man'. You can't go wrong with this album."
1,not so much a review of the CD,"k, I love Clay... he ROCKED on AI2.My only problem is the song ""Invisible""- lyrics: If I were invisible, i would watch you in your room"". STALKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!!! Does anyone else find this song as deeply disturbing as I do? He's got a GREAT voice tho! He just needs to think about the songs he's singing before recording them... I mean seriously..."
5,"And, that's HOW you Measure a Man",Perfection! The whole family loves the CD and him! You dont need your skip button with this CD.
5,BETTER WATCH OUT!,"I think Clay's CD is ABSOLUTELY GREAT!I listen to it every day. I would just like to make a point to all the Clay bashers/Ruben Studdards' fans out there. You had BETTER WATCH OUT! If you are intentionally trying to bash Clays' CD to lower its ratings, then you should prepare yourselves for when Ruben's CD comes out. Clay's fans far out number Rubens' fans and when push comes to shove..... What's that saying WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND!? Grow up,take your toys and go home. Oh and by the way Clay's CD is doing just great despite your rude comments."
2,"Amazing performance, substandard songs","During the run of ""American Idol,"" I was just like most of you--riveted to the show week after week because of Clay Aiken's astonishing voice. On the show, he sang and excelled in a variety of musical genres. However, on ""Measure of a Man,"" the producers have done Clay a disservice by giving him only mediocre ballads to sing. I kept hoping for at least one uptempo song--or funky song--or even funny song, to display Clay's amazing range and playful personality. I guess I'll have to wait for a concert DVD to get a full-fledged dose of Clay to rival his AI performances, because this CD doesn't deliver."
3,Disappointing,"I am a huge Clay fan, and this was my first cd purchase in 4 years. I was extremely disappointed by this cd as it really does not show off his fantastic voice. Clay's voice is meant to hit home. These are ""safe"" songs, and a safe cd for Clay. Not one of the songs (with the exception of ""This is the Night"") show off his ability to capture you. The songs are catchy for sure, and many will enjoy them. I was just expecting more, I guess. . ."
4,Aiken deserves better songs,"I love Clay Aiken's voice. I voted for him on American Idol and think that he should have (did??) win. His talent is partially wasted in this CD. Some of the songs are very weak. I would love to hear him sing Elton John or Johnny Mathis songs, because he is that good. Having bought this CD, I hope that he gets better producers next time. He is a Superstar but was given a mediocre song list on this CD."
4,Question,"To Jaan Uhelszki, Amazon editorial reviewer: Have you ever heard'N Sync or Backstreet Boys' interpetation of ""Solitaire""?Hm......."
2,Big Clay fan- unfortunately not of the album,"I love Clay's voice and I bought this album and I will buy the next. I think this album is overproduced and all the songs sound the same. I hope Clay's next album brings more personal meaning to his songs, and let's his voice come through more. I'm still a huge fan, I think his producers missed the mark unfortunately."
3,Thank God he has that voice!,"I waited with great anticipation for Clay Aiken's first CD. While I did fear that the people behind the making of Clay would corner him in a narrow music genre that I really don't care for (100% light pop), I held out hope that they would come up with music that was as imspirational as his voice. Well, thank God he has that voice, because were it not for the fact that I simply cannot get enough of it, I would probably not listen to this album more than once. I still love him and hold out hope that the next one will be better!"
5,"Measures 'Off the Scale""","Amazon, thank you for rushing my CD - arrived yesterday and I have listened to it constantly and carefully - all the way through, then repeating each song over several times; find that I have to tear myself away to listen to the next one. Love the album - think that Clay reviewed himself the best with his talk show comment - ""progression and improvement"" over what he had previously sung. And, I thought he was perfection before.What a beautiful tribute to his Dad's memory!The songs are definitely similar, yet each could stand alone! And each song is amazingly and lovingly offered. Each song makes the listener feel special.Now I know why the Brits yelled out to Prince Charles and Princess Diana as they were leaving hospital after Prince William's birth - ""Do it again! Give us another one!""The ONLY way to improve on any of these songs would be to see Clay perform each - live, video, guest appearane, suit, stripes, sweats - wouldn't matter."
2,Claymation Is a Big Disappointment!,"I was so looking forward to Clay's first full cd. Wow, what a disappointment.... very bland and no excitement in any of the tracks. Only 12 too... what a cheap trick! His glow is sure dimming if this is the best he can do. This is the Night was the best and he repeated it on this album... He could do so much better... Whahhhhh Guess I expected so much more."
3,Amazing voice...not so amazing song selection,"I think Clay has one of the best voices I've heard in a long time, but this CD wasn't what I was expecting. I suppose I was hoping for more of a Broadway feel, and this album is very much a pop ballad CD. Dare I say...sappy? Don't get me wrong, sometimes I like sappy, but it can be overdone. I still love Clay! I hope the next album will be a little more experimental."
1,YUCK!!,"Stop buying Clay's fame!!!!!This CD is definitely not 5 stars! L:ike someone said earlier, read the musiccritics reviews on it before you purchase.Whoever bought 10 copies of thisCD is a FOOL and an idiot! Actually that would make the whole so called ""Clay nation"" who are all purchasing multiple copies of it in their sick campaign to buy Clay his fame. Where is your trust in histalent? Please leave him alone and purchase the CD theway normal fans would buy for their favorite artist and see what happens?You are only hurting him, making him think that he's more than he is and franklyit's embarrassing. To see him strutting and stooping and straining and switching the mike from hand to hand trying to work up some feeling to the songs. lol!it's a big jokein our house. We actually had a party too laughing at this guy.I love Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and a few others, but to purchase more than one or two copies of their CD is totally rediculous! Stop buying Clays way to the top! LEAVE HIM ALONE!!!!"
1,Disappointed,"I am a big Clay Aiken fan and anxiously awaited his full cd. Unfortunately, this cd was not what I expected. Apparently, this was a rushed job because none of songs really appeal to me. The cd is bland, uninspiring and totally not what I expected. I expected more and hopefully his next cd will be better."
2,Ugh!,"I think it's such a shame that an enormous talent like Clay Aiken is pigeon-hold into making an album like ""Measure Of A Man"". Aiken's voice is soaring and wonderous throughout this disc, but the lyrics and arrangements of each track, excluding ""This Is The Night"" and the title track, are downright insipid. Think Backstreet Boys go Broadway. Clive Davis, the album's head producer is a bonafide hitmaker, but even he has to hang his head in shame at allowing this drivel to be sold to Aiken's fans. From the interviews that I've read and seen on TV featuring him, Clay seems like a decent human being, and has a voice that will mealt your heart. But, I strongly advice any serious music lovers to avoid this disc and wait for something more mature and stronger musically from Clay Aiken the vocal wonder."
5,Clay Rox and This is a Great C.D!,"This is an excellent c.d!It's great for helping you relax.My favourite songs on it are ""Measure of a Man"" and ""The Way"".As other people said,he's the real American Idol!The only bad thing about the c.d is that he didn't put the kinda more upbeat version of Invisible.But it's good how there's no music at the beginning of ""Invisible"" though.I would like to get the Christmas c.d where Clay sings ""The First Nol"".I heard a preview on a website and it sounds really good!I'm obsesed with Clay...;-)"
4,no comparison,I would not want to make this sound like a board to defend Clay Aiken but just wanted to say that comparing him to Josh Groban is like comparing apples and oranges. Josh Groban has a very fine and powerful voice too but it's a trained voice that has been under study for years. Clay's is a natural gift from above and has proven what a versatile singer he is and a total entertainer. he can sing just about anything given to him and make it his own.I am a Josh Groban fan too but I very much wonder if he can do just as much as Clay who is effortless in his renditions.It just seemed ridiculous to compare a pop singer to a neo classic style like Josh Groban. would you compare Celine Dion to Charlotte Church and Andrea Bocelli?
5,This album has become a favorite,"At first I was disappointed that the only song with which I was familiar was This Is The Night...... Now, I LOVE THEM ALL... This album is great and I find myself humming the songs all the time... I would venture to guess that Run To Me will become a classic.... it will be around for a long, long time... Also, how can anyone comment about Clay's looks? He is darling!!! If anyone watched any of the Radio Music awards tonight (Oct 27) and looked at the appearance of some of those characters.... you can appreciate this attractive guy!!! He is a sweetie... Ready for another album, Clay... hope you are working on the next one! Maybe the next one can be a mixture of old and new.... Already anxiously awaiting the next album!!! Clay appeals to all age groups... I am not a teenager, but I did buy three of the albums.... (two as gifts)...Anyone who buys Measure of a Man will not be disappointed.... It it truly great...."
4,Good Buy!,"I had seen the final episode of the US Idols which starred Clay and Reuben. After seeing what he was capable on that episode I really stood behind him, although I was a bit hesitant as he didn't stand out THAT much.I purchased this ablum, and to my surprise it's really good. Clay is a brilliant singer! I like most of the songs on this cd and I would recommend that if you're out to buy a cd for someone who is a fan of any Idols show (or just loves pop) then Clay's cd won't disappoint."
5,CLAY - BEST POP ALBUM OF 2003 says BILLBOARD MAGAZINE!!!!,"DOUBLE PLATINUM awarded on Good Morning America from Clive Davis of RCA!!!! WOW!!! So WELL DESERVED!!! Great cd by Clay Aiken!!!!! I love all of the songs, so well done!!! You can hear Clays voice so beautifully! I am so happy for Clay, and for me getting to listen to Measure Of A Man all day long!!! I HIGHLY RECOMEND this cd!!!!"
5,CLAY SHINES!!! WHAT A VOICE!!,"BEAUTIFUL ALBUM!! CLAY MEASURES UP! Could we finaly be seeing a change in the music industry? I think its about time to bring back music thats not about sex,drugs, and singers with potty mouths. Clays a nice young man who does'nt drink, smoke or swear. A good role model for our kids. He's not afraid to express his faith in god or how his faith plays a big role in his life. Clay has won the hearts of millions with his beautiful voice. NOVEMBER 30th IS CLAYS BIRTHDAY. HAPPY BIRTHDAY CLAY!!! ""25"" WE LOVE YOU!!"
4,Measure of a Man,"At first I was a bit disappointed. But I have listened to this CD many times now and find there are some really good tracks. Clay's fan base is so diverse that he and the producers are trying to have something for everyone on this CD. Therefore, there are bound to be some that each fan likes better than others. I hope that the next CD will include some of the great songs Clay did on AL,like Solitary man, Buttercup , etc. I find Clay's voice powerfully moving and entertaining on this CD and I can't wait for the next one."
5,You won't be able to stop playing it,The true Clay fans will love this cd. It has songs that apeal to the country and pop fans as well as people who love the power ballad. This cd shows clays diversity and the true power of his voice. It also showcases his ability to put so much emotion into a song that it will make you cry. One warning though once you put it in your cd player you won't be able to stop playing it. If this is an indication of what Clay can do I can't wait for his next cd. It is an amazing debut cd.
4,From an Idol fan - Seal Beach CA,"Clay has done a great job with 12 ""pretty-nice"" pop songs. He seems in a comfort zone as a song ""stylist."" A couple of the songs sound too digitized or synthesized or some other odd sound. Song #4 would be good for Cher, or a country singer. As a real fan of his voice, I wish he had better songs. The songs are neither 'hip' nor 'un-hip.' Just middle-of-of the road Vanilla songs. (Probably the catalog was limited.) On balance, there are at least 8 good, listen over-and-over songs, that showcase his voice and talent."
2,Clay is Invisible on this CD!!!,"Clay is a true talent... and I am sure he will grow / mature into a great singer. But this cd is full of pop fluff... there are no show stopping numbers to be found here... Clay is not a pop star... he should be in a Westend or Broadway show delivering show stopping number after number. And as one reviewer said... that even ""Solitaire"" wasn't included (which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent)... As for the American Idol creators... we're slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion... and even Clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is INVISIBLE!!!"
5,Clay,clay is an awesome performer and he is such and inspiration to me and my family. he has made me want to be a special education teacher and i want to thank him for it i love u clay eventhough i don't know u!!!
5,Clay is the Man!,"This Cd was fantastic. He has such an awesome voice. I am very impressed by the way that he sang those songs because all of them just got me so excited. Clay should have won, Clay really should have one. And he is going to win again on the music sales because this CD is one of my favorites of all time now."
2,Over-produced junk,"Simon Fuller has done it again, taken an average mediocre-talent and turned them into a media-made powerhouse of hometown glory and over-promoted love ballads. As with former Idol stars Kelly Clarkson (who was the runner-up and ironically had a better selling album) and Justin Guarini, Aiken's album is filled with a rare uptempo ballad, a medium tempo moody ballads and crooning slow colorless ballads. Even his linear notes are all-too-predictable, thanking his family and God -- sure to make any middle-aged housewife or grandma swoon.Overall, Aiken's ""Measure of a Man"" undeniably shows an aspiring talent at work (there is no denying his voice), but the lack of creative inspiration or even -anything- out of the box perhaps shows that Aiken hasn't actually measured up to the man he could be quite yet.If you're an aging house-wife or a grandparent you'll absolutely love this CD, but if you have any musical taste whatsoever you'll avoid it completely."
3,Disappointing,The album is overproduced and lacks the clarity and focus of Clay's live performances on American Idol. The record producer has watered his beautiful voice down to sound just like all the other boy pop stars and then drowned it out with overdone background vocals and orchestration. The only reason to buy this album is to give him a shot at another chance.
5,Best Album of 2003,"If you really want to know what the experts say, read the review of Clay's album on Billboard.com where the music reviewer cites this album as 'The Best Album of 2003'. Doesn't get any better than that, does it? I'm no expert, but I love listening to anything Clay sings. Do wish though that the producers of this album had included 'Solitaire' along with a couple of other classics. This is the voice of an angel...with the right material he will soar beyond the heavens. Looking forward to the next album!"
5,His Angelic voice shines thru!,"I HIGHLY recommend this album for ANY Clay Aiken fan! I have watched Clay from day one, when he entered that room with Simon, Randy and Paula, and declared himself the ""American Idol"". In my opinion, he IS the American Idol! I could not wait for this album to be released and I am NOT disappointed! The first three songs are wonderful---one of my favorites being ""Measure of a Man"", the title song of this CD. This is only his FIRST album and I predict the next to be even better! Congratulations, Clay, for the release of your first album! I look forward to watching it soar thru the charts!"
4,It's all based on what you like...,"Personally, I find the reviews on this site to be Clay haters arguing with Clay fans, and vice versa. What I think needs to be done, is take a step back, and look at this CD in a different way.Do you like this CD? Obviously if you hate Clay, there's no way you're going to like this CD and that's that. If you love Clay, you aren't going to hate it.Look at it like this. This CD is all Clay. He puts his message, personality, and voice into the music. If that is what you like, then like it. If you don't, you don't. Don't be biased either way. Look at it from the middle point. We aren't getting anywhere arguing.Clay fans, buy this CD. You'll adore it.Clay haters, don't. You'll dispise it."
5,Great Cd!,"I could not wait to buy this CD and it was well worth the wait. I have listened to it a dozen or more time and love all of the songs. Even though this cd was rushed I think it was great, that means his next cd will be even better."
1,OH NO CLAY,"Yes, there is no question about Clay's talent. That's a given. However, this album just doesn't show it. His singles were fabulous and then they disappoint us with this album. You can't even tell where one song ends and the next begins. It's all the same stuff. C'mon now~give the man the songs that he is so capable of delivering with spine tingling sensations!"
2,Disappointing and Drab,"I'm a big American Idol fan so I bought this CD. But if you are not an obsessed die hard of Clay Aiken...you will be disappointed. I think he should accentuate the twang some more and go after a country audience. This CD was nothing but schmaltzy, drab, and mediocre. So don't listen to all the raves without realizing that Clay's nutty fans think he's the second coming."
1,HAHAHAHAHAHAHA,"I'm sorry if any of you teen enjoy this lispy southern high school reject like 'em but i think it's all crap...don't get me wrong, i appreciate all forms of music and clay does have an ok singing voice but his style belongs on broadway doing a musical...he would be the BEST Sandra Dee on Grease i'm sure...it's funny to me how you can all like him because of a show..."
1,WIMPY!!,"Sorry Clay, I kept an open mind...but this CD is a corny, wimpy collection of out-dated pop. Clay should have stayed the red-haired, freckle-faced, 4-eyed christian singer that he once was. They have turned him into to a blonde, spiky haired howdy doody. My friends and I say......""CLAY NO WAY""!!!!!"
1,This cd proves why Ruben won,This cd is hurrendous. Ruben is SO much better. Want a good cd - check out soulful.
5,Finally....,"A CD I can listen to without skipping ANY songs. I like them all. True, this is not much of a departure from what we would expect from the AI2 Clay Aiken, but this is only the beginning of a long and successful recording/performing career for Clay. Many of us have been disenfranchised for so long from the music industry. Is the industry paying attention? Have they heard us loud enough? We want soul and beauty back in music. We want someone who isn't spewing filth and profanity to our children. And we want someone who has a conscience beyond making money. Clay has answered all those requests. This was money well spent...my favorite is ""The Way"". Can't wait to hear Clay on movie soundtracks and see him in solo tours."
4,Easy on the ears,"I love Clay and have since I first saw him on American Idol. What I mean by ""love"" is that I love his voice, his personality, his stage presence, and, I think most importantly, his values. His album is a good, solid first effort. But (and I hate to say ""but"") it's missing something. It's definitely well produced, and his voice is beautiful as always. But I think what's lacking is in the songwriting. Alot of the songs sounded the same to me, and they weren't as different as I thought they would be to what we've been hearing in mainstream pop for the last several years. I will defintely listen to the album, especially during my work day. But I think Clay's team can do better for him next time around. And, where the heck was ""Solitaire""?! I had heard it was going to be on the album, and was looking forward to hearing the long version, but it was nowhere to be found. :-("
5,Surpasses the Hype!,"This cd is way higher than my expectations! I can't quit listening to it! Clay's voice shines through, there's no overproduction.....it's just Clay. And that's what we all fell in love with! I'd recommend this cd to my best friend, little sister, or my grandmother! Definitely something for all ages!"
5,One of the best,One of the best cds i have heard in a long time. Far surpasses his AI2 performances. This is one cd that is consistently excellent material throughout. I'd recommend this cd to anyone!
4,A CD to enjoy many times and for many years to come,I have listened to Measure of a Man by Clay Aiken three times and have not skipped any of the songs. I don't think that I have EVER done that with a CD. It is very enjoyable and he did a terrific job for his first time out and I am looking forward to future CD's because I know they will only get better with experience. I am reserving one star for later when hopefully RCA lets Clay be Clay!
5,This CD is AWESOME!,"The first time I listened to this CD, I was a little disappointed because it wasn't really the same type of thing that Clay was doing on American Idol. I've listened to it non-stop despite this fact, and I have to admit it - I love it! There are some really cool songs. I love upbeat ""Invisible."" ""No More Sad Songs"" is probably one of my favorites, it reminds me of a powerful Paul McCartney ballad. If you have the McCartney CD, 'Flaming Pie' and enjoyed it, this seems kinda similar, but DEFINITELY more powerful and something you will not get sick of as fast! I also like the fact that there are songs that you can relate to that avoid negative images that the record companies try to impose on us as listeners. We can always trust Clay to only give us what he knows we REALLY want. THANK YOU CLAY!"
4,"Amazing Voice, but kind of Generic","Don't get me wrong; Clay has an AMAZING voice. There's a reason this guy was #2 on American Idol. But his songwriters need a shot of creativity. His lyrics, though heartfelt I'm sure, are about the same generic topics that every pop star sings about: love and loss. These are generally great topics, but not when it's the whole CD. I hope his next CD, if there is one, will have more variety concerning his song topics. I'm still giving this CD 4 stars because his voice just blows the majority of the faults away. I'd buy his Christmas CD if I had the money."
4,A record producer's wet dream,"Five stars for Clay, three stars for the producers who chose his material, thus it gets four stars. This guy can sing ANYTHING and sound totally original and breathtaking every time. He will be as big as Sony (is that who produced this?) let's him be. There are two hits on here: Sad Songs is awesome, as his signature song that he sung in the finale, this is the night. The rest are a pleasure to listen to, simply because Clay can do no wrong. He is undoubtedly the next Manilow or Diamond, a cash cow for the record company if they wouldn't hold back on giving him their best material. Hopefully this album will prove that he won't let them down and his next one will be packed with top material."
5,Measure of a Man,"I just got my cd today and I love it. I think it has something for everyone. The songs are beautiful just listen to the song Measure of a Man and you will see what I am talking about.Clay is a breath of fresh air, as I am sick and tired of not being able to listen to the radio or buy cd's where it is not littered with filth. I love the fact that Clay is taking a stand against this kind of garbage being fed to our kids."
5,Amazing CD for an amazing talent!,"Clay's CD has everything one could want. A stunningly beautiful voice, great lyrics, great songs. Clay's voice is highly recognizable when listening and does bring emotion and life to each song. You can play his CD over and over again. My favs are Invisible, I will carry you, The way, This is the night, Measure of a man, etc, etc. All the songs ""Shine"". I will never get tired of listening to this, and can't wait to see what is in store for us later. Everyone should buy his CD. You won't be dissapointed!!! Clay - a beautiful voice, a beautiful talent, a truly beautiful man."
3,Expecting Different,"Clay's new CD ""Measure of a Man"" was nice but I was expecting totally different types of Songs. He is such an awesome singer and I was expecting high volume songs not low. His single CD was such a BIG Hit and I hope this CD doesn't bring him down.Still #1 Clay Fan!!"
5,Go Clay!!!,"Even though he didn't win the season 2 American Idol, it's kinda like he did. There are many reasons why I say so. His album has done dropped and people acturally buy it. He's done had more videos then Ruben as on 3/3/04. He is already on tour. So, in many ways, he was a winner all along. I love this cd and I listen to it ALL the time! I'm not going to do a song by song review like I usually I do. I will however, tell you my favorite songs:This Is The Night (Bonus Cut), The Way, When You Say You Love Me, and Insivible. I will pobability have more favorite songs and when I do, I will edit this review for an up-to-date review on why I love Clay!! Go Clay!! If you LOVE Clay you will LIKE Kelly Clarkson (Season 1 winner.)"
4,Clay is Amazing,"I wasn't sure I was going to like this CD because I knew it wouldn't contain older pop songs like Clay sang during AI competition. After my very first listen, I loved it and haven't stopped listening to at least some of it since October.There's a little bit of everything in this CD; something for every taste. My favorite cuts are The Way, When You Say You Love Me, Touch, Invisible, Measure of A Man, I Will Carry You and This is The Night. Clay handles the vocals like he's been singing for years. He sings with passion and feeling.Clay has said in interviews that he wants to record songs with meaningful lyrics and great melodies. He was true to his word and I will never doubt him again."
5,Well Done,"I haven't liked much recent American pop, but Clay sure is a good singer. I watched him perform ""Invisible"" on the Billboard Awards... I was completely blown away. Simply amazing. A friend had also sent me his This is The Night/Bridge Over Troubled Water single earlier this year. Amazing as well. Good work, Clay. Hope your future albums are excellent as well."
5,This is what a pop album should be.....,"Clay Aiken has arrived...and with a definate flair for pop...This man knows how to sell a song...he understands when to hold back...and he understands when to hit the ""money note""...Songs like ""Invisible"" and ""Touch"" are great pop songs, very radio friendly. ""The Way"" and ""Touch"" have just the right amount of sex, which sells a song. ""Measure of A Man"" will give you a glimpse of the future of this mature individual. And of course, his signature song ""This is the Night"", still gives chills as one of the first glimpses into the soul of the individual.Each song on the album is unique, however, together, they create an incredible debut album.This is an artist, with so much more to offer. I can't wait to see what Clay Aiken will give to pop music next."
4,Breath of Fresh Air,"Like the man himself, Measure of a Man is a breath of fresh air. Perfect Day is the most distinctive track, diverting from the power ballad style Clay Aiken has perfected, and sure to be a hit on the charts (reminds one of Elton John a bit?). This is the Night continues to evoke strong emothions even several months after we first heard it. My only criticism is that Clay is a top-notch vocalist who should take more risks with his style...he will surely succeed...with pipes like his, how could he not?"
4,Great Debut Album,"I can honestly say that I was pleasantly surprised by this album. After avidly watching American Idol, I had expected Clay's first CD to sound... well, like Barbara Streisand or the like. Being a fan of rock/punk/pop, that did not seem like such a good thing; however, this does not sound anything like those ""outdated"" musicians and can... no, SHOULD be enjoyed by anyone who can call themselves a lover of music. Even if you do not usually listen to pop music, definitely give this a chance."
5,MOAM,"I have honestly never bought a CD that I liked all of the songs on . Well, that has changed. This CD does not have a bad song on it. Clay shows that he has arrived. He has stayed true to himself and is here to stay. Highly recommend!!"
3,Clay needs a songwriter!,"I am disappointed by this CD only because I know Clay is capable of sounding so much more powerful. His incredible voice is drowned out by background vocals and music too much of the time.I think his future albums would benefit from some stronger songwriting and better arrangements. I too, was expecting more ""Solitaire"" sound! Maybe some help from Neil Sedaka, Neil Diamond, Richard Carpenter?!?So far my favorite cut is ""No More Sad Songs"". I have to admit, the more I listen, the more I like."
5,A Rising Star,"You know that an artist is popular when he garners so many reviews from so many people that love and hate him but this guy is a rising star!It took a lot of guts to get up in front of a panel of judges to audition for American Idol and then even more guts to sing in front of Simon and the rest of America!This album contains songs from different genres of popular music so there's something for everyone. I personally love them all! Give it a chance. I'm sure that you will NOT be disappointed.We gave Clay a chance and look where he is now!And for those of you who keep saying that he's ugly, take a good look at yourself in the mirror and see what's inside."
5,A TRUE ARTIST CLAY AIKEN,I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM AS SOON AS IT HIT THE STORE AND AS SOON AS I LISTENED TO IT I LOVED EVERY TRACK. IM SICK OF LISTENING TO THE STUFF THE DISC JOCKS THINK ARE GOOD SINGERS. RAP AND THE YELLING AND CURSING FOR SHOCK VALUE TO SELL SOMETHING AND CALL IT TALENT. I LIKE ALL TYPES OF MUSIC AS LONG AS THE SINGING IS GOOD AND THE MUSIC IS GOOD BUT SO MANY POP AND ROCK STATIONS DONT KNOW WHAT IS TRUE ARTISTIC WORK ANY MORE. IM NOT SAYING ITS ALL BAD BUT TOO MUCH OF IT IS. CLAY WAS WONDERFUL TO LISTEN TO ON THE SHOW AND EVEN BETTER ON THE NEW ALBUM. ITS RARE TO FIND AN ALBUM THAT ALL THE SONGS ARE GOOD BUT CLAY HAS DONE IT AND I WILL NODOUBT BUY EVERYTHING HE PUTS OUT IN THE FUTURE.I CONTINUE TO LEAVE THIS CD IN MY CAR PLAYER AND LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER.
5,Clay Aiken Debuts at No. 1!,"""Measure of a Man"" has debuted at No. 1! Billboard has named the CD as Best Pop Album of 2003!Why don't you buy one or more of Clay Aiken's CD? I guarantee you that you will love the lyrics, the music, Clay's wonderful voice, the high and low notes, the emotion that he brings into the 12 tracks, absolutely takes you to another place.""Perfect Day"" and ""Shine"" are very Beatlesque songs. I'm sure these 2 songs will do very well. ""Invisible"" is a catchy song and is already doing very well on the radio in the States; hopefully, our radio stations will play it more often soon. My favourite of the 12 is ""Measure of a Man"". A wonderful song that makes you stop and think.Buy Clay Aiken today - you won't regret it!"
5,Every song is outstanding,"The song choices for this CD are excellent. As the album was playing, I couldn't decide which track I liked better. Not since the Beatles have I been able to say honestly that I loved each and every one of the songs. Invisible, The Way, When You Say You Love Me, Measure of a Man, and Touch are incredible. I hope this is only the first of a long string of great albums. Well done, Clay, well done."
2,nothing out of the ordinary,"This man really does have a great voice, don't get me wrong... but I don't think this is an album that people should waste there money on.Yes, I am a fan of Josh Groban but this is not what the deal is about. I just think that this cd has some crappy songs with crappy lyrics. I mean 'Invisible' is about Clay wanting to watch me in my room. That kind of freaks me out. I don't want some guy on my wall watching me ge undressed.Clay got on American Idol to become the famous person that he is. If it wasn't for that show then he would still be a nobody teacher. He has a normal voice. Nothing that someone in a church choir doesn't have.I think that if you are going to blow your money on real music, then you should buy Josh Groban. Yea, he does sing in different languages, but if you translate them they have great meanings. And you can even get addicted to Italian. At least Josh can speak another language. heh."
1,DOESN'T MEASURE UP,This CD disappointed me. I was expecting more from Clay but I guess this is what happens when you rush your work. I hope his next one is better because this one sucked.
1,Not even one star to be honest,"This is just an album full of oversung sappy, cheesy lyrics. Horrible production from the AI machine. Where do they find these songwriters?And could Clay over enunciate a little more?Yes, he won't sing about sex, but he's singing about being invisible and watching someone in their room. <@@> Scary!"
1,Absolute Rubbish,On behalf of Randy-Paula and the producers of american Idol I humbly apologize for besieging America with this crap.
1,Invisible is the only worthy song,This CD is just full of rockish country same old stuff. I really do not think clay makes a good pop star at all and this CD proves it.
1,Disaster,"It's easy, there're only a few possibilities why you like this album:1. You're a little gal in your early teens, and u think he's, well, cute.2. You know zilch about music. You're trying to be a victim of the mushrooming commercial music that I'm so sick of.Did u ever feel a rush of blood oozing to your heart. NO? Then his songs probably dun impress you much."
1,I'll tell you why he's bad!,"Clay Aiken... why is he so big? Answer: he was on American idol. Did he win? Answer: No! Then why is he bigger than Ruben? Answer: it's a miracle! Number one, you have to admit, he looks sort of like a clown. Two, even his feet are huge! They look like a joke. But, I realize that this has nothing to do with his singing. What do I think about his singing? Awful! Every song sounds the same, and if he and everyone else would only realize how NORMAL he really is, you'd know that nothing of his is worth buying. If you want some real music, go buy Michael Buble's debut album, there's a guy with REAL talent. Clay Aiken is just a screaching clown that somehow scored a record deal. I will give it one star only for the fact that there is an actual CD in a case, that someone had to make."
1,UH OH,"UH OH CLAYMATES!!! Clay's album has fallen out of the top twenty sellers on Amazon.com!!! Quick, better buy ten more copies to get him back up there! Because we all know you can judge the greatness of a record by how many copies get sold. (NOT!)"
1,When a good voice meets bad music,"This album is a complete waste of Clay's voice. All I can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad Air Supply meets bad Barry Manilow. I can't understand what motivates these outstanding reviews for a album that's not worthy of them. These songs are about exciting as Muzak. Except if Clay's music was playing in elevators, I would be forced to take the stairs. I hope by the next release Clay has the music to complement his voice."
5,A awesome CD,I can't stop listening to this album. Every day my favorite song changes. There are no duds on this album. Clay's wonderful voice in combination talented songwriters make this CD a joy to listen to.
5,Against All Odds- Real Music is Back,"I've read many of the reviews posted on Amazon- most of them echo what I felt when I first heard this CD-- it's the best CD I have bought in a long time. I listen to MOAM at least 2 to 3 times a day- Clay Aiken's voice just makes me feel happy- sounds corny; but in the world we live in today it's nice to feel that again. I didn't realize how snarky, and snotty the music industry was until I read some of the ""critics"" reviews of this CD- I guess I just don't get it- what's wrong about a pure & honest talent??Do yourself a favor-buy this CD- The Way, Shine, I Will Carry You, I Survived You- in fact the whole CD is excellent-- I never skip a song- I start my day with this CD & I end it with this CD.Clay, next time make it a double CD- & quickly."
5,The Real American Idol,"I followed Clay through the American Idol process from start to finish and all I can say is I hope this is just the begining of what should be a long and successful career. This CD was fabulous and well worth the wait. There isn't a bad song on it and his voice is simply mesmerizing. I think there are several songs on it that could be hits for him. Anyway you slice it, I will buy as many CD's as this young man records. Not easy for a forty something woman to admit. : ) I am going to purchase the Idols Christmas CD just for the Clay song. My advice, buy it, you won't be sorry."
5,a mix of james taylor meets elton john! breathtaking,"I personally found that this is one of the best cd's i have ever listened to. Clay aiken is not only the true american idol, but a wonderful young man with a very positve outlook and message. How refreshing. I recently tried to get concert tickets to his tour with kelly clarkson in N.C, only to find them all sold out. Instead I will will be driving to washington d.c to take my 3 year old for her birthday to his concert at the mci center. His voice is so beautiful and almost reverant. I would give this cd 10 stars if it were allowed!!!!!"
2,I was a Clay Fan,I was a Clay Fan until I hear this karoake music. This album does not take any chances with this self imposed pop idol. Hecame in second and now I can see why.
2,Very disappointing,"I really hoped this would be fabulous, but it just isn't. All the songs sound the same. Same tempo, same back ground and back-up. RCA or whoever told Clay to sing all the same type of songs was way off base. When done live, one song only, then Clay does come through as we know him. Where is ""Unchained Melody""? One of the songs that got him to the top two on Idol should have been included."
2,Only Enjoy hearing him on TV,"I really like clay Aiken but I found this CD ""Measure of a Man"" very boring. I was quite disapointed with some of the songs and the album in general. I enjoy watching and listening to Clay on the TV. I also think he is a very sweet man and I like his singing just not this CD."
1,clay hot man,"Dear Mr.Clay,You CD is a great CD. You voice is plesant to here. You very talentd singer. You hot man and not fat like the Rubin dude. I wish you look and hope make another grate CD soon. You win all Garmmys. Bye bye."
2,What have they done to this poor man?,"The first time I saw Clay on American Idol, in his audition, I said to myself ""theres the winner"". The first time I listened to Clay's album, I said to myself ""theres a winner who has been turned into a junky commercialized pop-culture phenomena, exploited with traditional sappy songs that were handed to him by writers, and oversung in a way that only a person who has sung 100 songs on TV that all sound exactly the same can.""Poor Clay- in a small dose, he has a fine voice. Heck, he could make a really good Broadway performer with his ability to belt 'em out. It's prefabricated crap like this CD that makes me want to spew.A star for Clay's talent, and one for pity. This album truly deserves no credit, because none of it came from the heart."
4,Only onward and upward for Clay,"This is an excellent debut album. The songs were selected before AI2 completed and an exhausted Clay was already recording two weeks later. I have seen how Clay has grown as an artist/performer over the past months. If this album can go double platinum, I shiver to think what the next one will do. There is a lot of time to work on the songs and production. I love all the songs, but MOAM is my favorite. Everyone in my family who has heard the album has asked for it as a Christmas stocking stuffer."
3,hope for better next time,"After reading many of the reviews I can see that there is a market for this CD....but, for those of us who truly appreciate this amazing voice and unique personality, we know he can do better and needs better management. Those who say this is the best CD EVER please listen to Josh Groban's first album. I am happy that Clay is a wonderful idol for the young kids, everyone knows we need this...but for those of us who really know music, please give us an album that really uses Clay's voice and is not drowned out by noisy busynoise music and a variety worthy of his talents."
3,"good songs, lacking feelings","It's pretty obvious that Clay only sings his producer-written songs to show off his skills in singing. By doing so, many of his songs are oversung and without true artistic feelings towards it, which makes many of his songs sounds very dull and commonplace. I was slightly dissappointed with how his voice sounded on the CD, it wasn't as good as I thought. Although many of his songs are very catchy, Clay makes them sound nothing unique and even destroys alot of the good music. overall, this CD did not attract me as much as other people, I just thought it's a little overated and common"
3,Where's the Clay we know and Love?,"His voice is awsome, but where are all those true ""Clay songs""? I didn't expect him to get sunk into the pressure of being a ""Pop Star"" We fell in love with the Clay who could sing anything with great emotion. Why is he producing songs that all those other pretty boys are doing? Clay, next time remind us why your better than them."
3,Nothing Outstanding,The CD is o.k.. I did not like the songs that were used. Clay has a much better voice than this music allowed.
2,"depressing, clay should rethink his songs","my wife and I bought this cd over the weekend and the one word that comes to mind is depressing. It has none of the great tunes I expected from the likes of clay. he was always known for his use of ballads, but come one, how many songs does one need about losing your love or making it on your own without you....blah blah blah.I expected some powerhouse tunes, and wish he could have done some music for perhaps an upcoming Disney movie..."
2,Bland pop crossed with Broadway wannabe,"While I love a few tracks on this CD and admire the writers and producers involved (Darren Hayes, Desmond Child, Cathy Dennis, Danielle Brisbois, Aldo Nova), almost every song sounds the same. And Clay has this annoying habit of ""finishing"" each and every song as if it were performed live. Maybe it's just me but I kind of like (or am used to) fade outs in pop songs. I definetly like Clay's voice and there are standout songs that actually effected me (the title track especially moved me) but I have to say Kelly Clarkson's debut CD is head and shoulders a better produced collection than this middle of the road, unoffensive, generic collection of milquetoast. I expected more from Clay after his first single. Better luck next time."
1,It hurts,It hurts to see Clay fall like this. The momentum leading up to the CD release was so great that it only leads to disappointment. It's not Clay's fault. I blame it on the media and hype surrounding the release that Clay could not do anything but fail.Please do not waste your hard-earned money on this trash. Josh Grobin's CD is much more satisfying.
1,Very Disappointed,"I just purchased the new Clay Aiken CD and I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in my life. I feel like this man's beautiful voice is no where even near 10% of what it is capable of on this album. Most of the songs don't even sound like him. I have waited for this to come out because his voice sends goosebumps up my spine when he hits ""those notes"", and I skipped through every song on this album and found none that even came close. I hope that Clay speaks up and says, this is not the measure of me, and his next album show cases his God given talent. When you hear songs like ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" that are amazing and then listen to this album, you cannot even begin to compare. The only reason I gave it one star is because of the song ""This is The Night,"" other then that, I would not have rated it."
5,Music to my Ears,"What an absolutely ""wonderful"" album. Perfection plus.....Clay so knows what we want to hear.....Every single song on this album is beautiful and sung with such emotion. I don't know if I ever will be able to pick a favorite out of these. I love them all. Okay, when is the next album going to be released?"
4,Aiken's album is tops for me,"I have read a couple of articles on the new Clay Aiken album, Measure of a Man, and I have to say I am very dissappointed in how people are bashing the albums songs. Personally, I love the album, I think that he can sing any song and make it sound fantastic, because he has an amazing talent. Maybe everyone should stop critizing him for not being what they think he should be, and start appreciating what he truly is, and gifted singer with a strong solid voice."
2,"Hun, Clay is sooooo lame","Hun, the CD is nothing special. It is not an essential CD like the Beatles, Supremes, or Aretha. He will be a one CD hit wonder huns."
1,What did they do to him???,"After listening to the first few songs of the album I've been waiting months for, I had to look and make sure I picked-up the right one. It doesn't even sound like him, which is ironic since most of his audience liked him for the way he sounds!!! The songs could use some help, but at least they used songs by serious song writers, such as Desmond Child. Let's just hope that Clay can hang around enough to go his own way and sound the way he did before."
1,What a shame! What a waste! What sabotage!,"This CD is a spectacular disappointment. Clay has a huge, pure voice, and this CD works hard to cancel it out. Overproduced and underbalanced, every song is marred by a pervasive, tinny whitenoise, as if the drummer was told to keep the cymbals hissing through every song. This fuzzes up Clay's pure, clear tone, and cancels out every nuance of his emotional and musical resonance. It's as if the producer/arrangers didn't trust his voice to carry. What idiots. Clay seems like a smart kid; hopefully he's smart enough to choose another producer for his next CD."
2,Not a Good Measure,"I will prepare myself to face the wrath of other Clay fans, but I think this CD is a disappointment.Clay's voice has been watered down on most of the tracks (about 3 of them sound something ""like"" Clay). This is probably an attempt to attract the crowd Simon thought Clay couldn't attract; but the producers/writers may have garnered Clay new fans at the expense of the old ones.I do not think he would have sold one million pre-sale copies had many of us heard the entire CD. This CD is Justin Timberlake lite (and that's no compliment).No Diane Warren or Sedaka style songs. Someone should have listened to his demo CD (or AI for heaven's sake)in order to put together a debut worthy of Clay's voice.If this continues, I will be an ex-Clay fan. Or, should I say, I will remain an AI Clay fan, forever waiting for him to come back to form.Anyway, I know many of you like the CD, but for me, what a let down."
3,great background/working album,"No doubt, Clay's voice is amazing. The content on his debut album is only minimal though. You can tell the songs that were chosen were being shopped around to many other artists, and not hand-tailored for Clay himself. Frankly, I'm tired of hearing gay musicians sing about women. It just sounds really unconvincing. We've seen this previously with Will Young's album, the American Idol winner for Europe. But all around, Clay's debut album is easy-going and worth to have playing in an office or while working at home."
1,Yuck,"Clay Aiken's bombastic, over the top singing style is bad enough to make Baby Jesus cry. If you're not a tween or a demented middle-age soccer mom, I recommend you pass on buying this album.Patooey."
2,Not good enough,"Clay Aiken has an outstanding voice, but it isn't showcased here. This is another bland pop CD full of predictable top 40 songs. I wish him all the best, but I certainly hope his next effort will reflect his amazing talent and show more imagination."
3,Awesome pop cd,"This cd delivers exactly what was intended. It's a really good pop cd - combining catchy tunes with Clay's incredible voice. Background is a little too loud, but Clay's voice soars above. Especially love Clay's emotion in ""The Way"" - awesome. This is a great first effort. Many more to come. Thanks Clay - you really delivered."
5,A Powerful First Album,"A showcase for Mr. Aiken's exceptional voice, this power-pop album will have you singing along in no time. Every cut a potential Top 10 hit, there's something for everyone here, from the power-chord-filled ballad 'Run To Me', to the Beatle-esque 'Shine' and 'Perfect Day', to the country-flavored 'When You Say You Love Me', to the breathtakingly beautiful love ballad 'The Way'. A tiny disappointment for this fan: Mr. Aiken's lower register is barely in evidence. Still, that doesn't stop this album from being 100% en-JOY-able."
3,"Too rushed, too safe!","First off: I DO like Clay and admire his wonderful voice! This cd, however, was a small disappointment.Though there are some nice surprises on this cd, you have to wonder if this cd was really the one Clay wanted to make given that it was rushed out only months after he came in 2nd in American Idol Season Two. Did he really get the songs he's ""dreamed of"" to make the album he's ""dreamed of"" in such a short time? Doubtful.Some of the songs have great hooks and there's several upbeat tunes--and there's guitars! Some of the songs have rather bland melodies and an alarming lack of heart and soul that endeared Clay to America.So what's missing? A little bit of soul. Interesting and varied arrangements. And backing vocals. Additional vocals can add texture, variation, and a bit of depth & soul to a song.Compare Kelly Clarkson's cd, where you hear a bit of soul and immediately get the feeling that SHE made the cd she wanted to make."
4,not the best but still worth it.,"Well, like some of you I first listened to this CD and was not impressed. There are some good tracks, but they seem to go down hill as the cd goes along. I was particularly dissapointed with the very lifeless rendition of ""This is the Night."" After an amazing live performance of this song on the show, the recorded version is dead and boring. Clay has an amazing voice but this cd certainly doesn't seem to portray his passion for the music like his live performances did. Still, I do love his voice, and he is an amazing singer. Hopefully this will not be the end and the next cd will bring out more of the mind-blowing vocals that we all know as Clay Aiken. Long and short--If you love Clay it's worth buying this cd, but don't expect an Idol-like performance."
1,A Matter of Spellling,"Does it matter how you get there? It's impossible to say if Aiken would sound different atop the virtual Mount McKinley if he had worked his way up and wrote his own songs. I think it would, because the sameness of the tracks are as alive as echoes in an anechoic chamber. How do you spell ""sucks""?"
5,A Stunning Debut,"If your musical tastes run to terrific songs sung by a stunningly beautiful voice, this album is for you. It's a quality product from beginning to end. A bit retro without ever sounding dated, each song on the album allows a different facet of Aiken's talent to shine through. If you loved Journey, you'll be thrilled with Run to Me. If you remember Beatlemania, you'll adore Shine. And yet, Aiken is always, uniquely himself. If you know anything of his history, you'll know that No More Sad Songs, while seemingly a breakup song, probably has a different meaning for Aiken. If you know anything of his values, you'll understand why Measure of a Man is the title track. This is, without a doubt, the most enjoyable pop album I've heard in a long time!"
5,SIMPLY WONDERFUL!,"Every song in this CD is wonderful! AIKEN proves that real talent still exists and after purchasing this album (along with his earlier single BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER,)it is no wonder why so many people love him. I look forward to his future albums! AIKEN is my IDOL!!!"
5,GREAT MUSIC !!,"I think Clay Aiken is the best thing that has happened to music in a long time. This CD is great and I listen to it over and over again. Clay is a fantastic singer, a great person who is sincere, giving and a wonderful all around good human being. I am looking forward to many more CDs from him. I am also looking forward to attending his solo concert tomorrow evening at Sioux Falls, SD. Can't wait."
5,Measure of a Man - beautiful,Clay's first CD is wonderful. It showcases his range and the uniqueness of his voice. Invisible and Touch are upbeat and can easily be danced to. The Way and Measure of a Man highlight Clay's ability to do ballads like no other. When You Say You Love Me has a bit of a country flavour and Shine and I Survived You are on the edgier side. The CD just gets better and better everytime you listen and Clay sings every song with passion and emotion. A great first album.
5,Measure of a Man- beautiful,"Clay's Cd is just magnificent. I can honestly say there is not one bad track on the album. Everytime you listen to it, it just gets better and better. Invisible and Touch are upbeat and make you want to get up and dance. When You Say You Love Me has a little bit of a country flavour and The Way and Measure of a Man are pure ballads. And Clay just doesn't sing the lyrics, he is the lyrics. It showcases his amazing range and the uniqueness of his voice. Listen to the CD a few times and you will agree it is a wonderful first album for Clay Aiken."
3,Disappointed,"I wish Bridge Over Troubled Water was included. I love Clay's voice, but most of the songs lacked something. He is SO talented."
2,clay you deserve something better than that,"I just tried listening to the cd again and still could not find myself liking anything in it. they all soumd alike and boring, the arrangements are so horrible and mediocre and for anyone used to good music this just doesn't make sense.In fairness to Clay who has an awesome and powerful voice, you do not deserve this crap of songs and i hope that he would look into these seriously. please realize that the fans are a varied bunch from the teenyboppers to the older ones with very discriminating tastes. i happen to be one of them, and though i loved all of the AI2 performances i was really expecting something that would be appealing and enjoyable. sadly i find nothing here that makes me want to listen to it again and again.I hope the second cd will be of better quality w/ good vocal and musical arrangement, better songs that would showcase Clay's singing talent."
1,Clay please dont become so commercial!,"First let me start by saying that clay was y favorite American Idol, I thoght, and still think, that he should have beat Ruben, Now he very well could have been a member of the bubble gum band N Sync .the One Star is for clays great voice, the lack of the other 4 stars is for his giving into that teeny bopper sound."
1,Recycled and Reused,"Measure of a Man should read Measure of a Boy. His ""so-called"" music is only been recycled from previous performers such as N-Sync, Backstreet Boys, etc. Isn't there anyone out there with an original voice or original music that they write themselves? This guy is not even worth watching as I witnessed one night on Jay Leno's, Tonight Show. Give me Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, even Luciano Pavarotti! At least these guys can and did sing with soul and a lot of heart, something this kid should learn before he releases another song. Even my 15 and 17 year old kids just can't get into this guy's singing. Sorry Clay!"
1,New material,"I am a huge Clay fan, but I am extremely disappointed in this CD. The man can sing like no one else, but he had to sing songs that were less than stellar, to say the least. Give him some great songs to sing, and he'll do right by them."
2,"Great Voice, Empty Soul","Admitedly, he has a mesmerizing voice. HOWEVER, he still lacks the ability to have a grasp of the nuances and emotions to be shown in each songs that he sings. He's a born singer but he needs to get all the technical skills in singing before he could be labeled as the 'American Idol'. Unlike Clay, Josh Groban, though not yet fully polished too, could easily control his 'pianissimo and forte' and melt your heart. You don't have to worry if he would make any embarrassing kinks in his performance. As another comparison, Kelly Clarkson's performance is so firm and solid. She's qualified to be a true artist, while Clay isn't."
3,what the heck?!,"Being a big fan of pop music and American Idol in general, I was QUITE disappointed to see that Clay did a cover of D-Side's ""Invisible"" He does the tune well, but just a shame to see a cover of a single from a boyband that JUST ALSO released that as their single as well in the UK! *tisk tisk*"
3,A Disappointment,"I began watching American Idol because a coworker raved about Clay. I continued to watch because his voice was so beautiful it was heartbreaking. I waited for this CD and thank heaven I listened to clips first on the internet so I knew not to buy it.His glorious voice has been changed to a bland, ordinary, sounds-like-every-pop-star out there voice and the songs are only average. I was afraid RCA would do this to him.I gave the CD 3 stars because it's an average rating for an average CD. If Clay had sung on the CD the way he sang on the show there wouldn't be enough stars in the sky to rate it."
1,Sucked!,"There was not one song on this CD that impressed me. I expected more from Clay Aiken. His voice was drowned out by the music half the time and the lyrics did not capture my attention. In other words, there is not one track that I found myself humming or singing later.I force fed myself the whole CD just to get my monies worth. I was very dissappointed. Not worth buying. Hopefully, his next album will be more entertaining or at least bearable. I am a fan."
3,A Truthful review.,"I like Clay Aiken. He is a darn good singer. But this album is just average. It is not ground breaking. I expected better from him. Almost all the songs sound alike. (""Shine"",""I Will Carry You"", and ""Run To Me""). The songs didn't give him the ability to show off his voice. The album sounds rushed. The best songs on it are ""Invisible"" (because its catchy and up tempo), ""The Way"" (It sounds like it could possibly be a classic- its definately a great song), ""Measure of a Man"" (it delivers a strong message), and ""This is the Night"". It pales in comparison to Kelly Clarkson and Fantasia. Their albums are much more put together."
5,AWESOME CD!! :),"Clay Aiken has got to be the BEST singer in the world! I LOVE this dude! His first CD, 'Measure of a Man', was absolutely AWESOME!! It includes hit songs such as 'Ivisible', 'The Way', 'When You Say You Love Me', 'No More Sad Songs', and 'Measure of a Man'. Not only are all the songs on the CD an awesome showcase and display of his voice, but they are all appropriate; no cussing or inappropriate references. I'm so proud that of him for being clean and staying true to his values. Kudos for Clay! Go out and buy this CD today! You will not regret it! :)"
5,EXCELLENT ALBUM by CLAY AIKEN!!!!!,"I really like Measure Of A Man so much, and the thing is I have kids and I can play it loud and don't have to worry about anything bad being said! My daughter loves singing along with Clay. GREAT CD!!! My mom likes it so much too!!! Clay thank you so much for this, truly!!!! Thank you so much!!!"
5,Clay is the best. Jaan is not!,"I bought MOAM as soon as it came out and I love it. It's amazing that the disc isn't worn out already. When and if it does, I will just buy another one. lol :) Clay sings with such feeling and each song touches my soul. As for Jaan, I am really upset. If you do not like Clay, why are you giving a review of the album? You have no idea what you are talking about. I agree with the others: Amazon should let you go. Besides, those who have yet to discover Clay (who hasn't) may be swayed by your comments and that would be a shame!"
2,"3 decent songs, rest of it-blah","I like ""Touch"" best, ""This is the Night"" & ""Invisible"" are also pretty good, but I'm over ""Invisible"" by now. The rest of the CD just runs together for me. I get no feeling from Clay, although he has a good voice, he has little emotion and tends toward glory or held notes to impress. My least favorite of the 4 idol CDs I own, even Justin's gets played more often."
1,Disappointed but still a fan.,"Can't hide my disappointment with this CD. I was looking forward to it, especially after attending the Idol concert in Raleigh. Unfortunately on this CD Clay is overpowered by background singers. There is also no diversity. Most of the songs sound the same to me. As an older fan I was hoping for some classic numbers like those Clay sang on the TV series. I won't be listening to this CD again. Hopefully whoever is responsible for it will learn from the experience and can produce something which will let Clay shine and reach out to his entire audience on his next CD."
1,bad music at its best,this is the worst album i have heard since barry manilow . clay did a snow job on the american people witrh this crap he put out songs with no meaning at all. give me back my money clay. kelly clarkson was far better then this junk that no one wants to listen to. go back to georgia red clay.
2,Really bad :(,That a bad star for clay aiken this c-d is really borring and all the songs sound the same. One listen of this album is enought to say don't waste your money into this c-d. Really peace of nothing.
2,Doesn't Measure Up!,"This CD is a huge disappointment. Clay has such an awesome voice, and this CD does little to show off his true talent. The songs are average at best and lack the kind of melodies that would truly show off Clay's gift. I've read many reviews of this CD and the most recent stated the same. It lacks any luster and will probably get lost in a pile of old CD's. Good luck next time Clay on producing some more appropriate music for your awesome voice."
1,Nice guy and great voice,but I liked him better on American Idol. I'm glad that others like it his cd and that he's doing really well on the charts.
1,Go Back in the studio and Try Again,I agree with the woman who reviewed this album. It just sounds like Backstreet Boys and Nsync music recreated in 2003. Been there done that. Clay needs to step his game up if he wants to last in the music industry any longer.
4,AWESOME!,This CD is great. is still think he deserved to win. and it shows. if he has all of his albums like this there is no way he will ever be matched.
5,I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT!!,"I can't remember of any other CD in recent years that has had such a mushroom effect as this wonderful CD. It's popularity just grows and grows. I can see why. I have listened to this CD for a month straight - I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT!! What wonderful vocal ability!It is of no wonder to me why this CD continually registers in the top 10 best sellers here. It deserves it.If you want to hear wonderful, uplifting, fresh music, and generally just amazing singing, then buy Measure of a Man. You won't be disappointed."
5,MEASURE OF A SUPERSTAR!!,This is absolutely everything I have been waiting for! It has ballads- pop songs- and to my pleasant surprise-- a bit of a rock edge to it. I am normally a heavy metal girl- and that is why my friends and family have a hard time understanding my Clay obsession- but he truly represents a man whose talent goes beyond what was presented on American Idol. Very Impressive Clayton!!
4,Decent debut,"While I did not really follow American Idol or any of that, I decided to give this CD a listen after hearing ""Invisible"" on the radio and seeing Clay's video on TV. I was really surprised at the voice coming out of this young man! His debut CD is very polished sounding. I really like the beat of ""Invisible"", ""I Will Carry You"" is very positive song and I smile when I hear ""When You Say You Love Me"". The rest of the CD is not groundbreaking, but still worth a listen because of Clay's very smooth, powerful delivery. Thanks"
4,Late to the party,"I never watched American Idol and I rarely listen to pop music, but I clicked on this CD one day and listened to the clips just to see what all the fuss was about. I liked what I heard, bought it, and I have played it every day since then. There's just something about it, there's not a bad track on there. Is it the most well-crafted, lyrically sophisticated CD made this year? No, but it is entertaining, catchy, and let's face it, Clay's voice could make the phone book sound good. There isn't anything that is going to appeal to everyone. If you like what you hear from the clips, you're going to like the whole CD."
5,THE MAN HAS BEEN MEASURED,"After listenting to this CD since 10/14/03 numerous times daily---I enjoy each song every time I listen to the CD. ""The Way"" ""Run to Me"" ""Shine"" ""Touch"" are my front runners right now but I enjoy all the songs. Why is Clay so intesting--his eyes, his mouth and his incredible voice!! Can the guy sing-YES! I saw Clay in concert during the AI tour--he has that quality that comes out and WOWS the crowd and holds you thru each and every performance and he has done the same with his first CD! I will continue buying his music because of his wonderful qualities!!!You go CLAY! And if you have not heard him sing ""Noel"" on the Holiday CD you are missing probably the best verison of the song I have ever heard!!! Makes you want to stand up and shout to the heavens!Clay measures up in every way as a true entertainer in every way possible!"
1,Stinks,I am sorry but this CD just does not work. You are better off buying the single mp3 that you want to listen to. Buying the complete CD is a waste.
2,clay- not all hes craked up to be....,"he sings good, but he sings bad songs, the only good song is The Way."
1,Why I Hate Potato Chips,"Actually I love Potato Chips...this just plain SUCKS. What is wrong with you people?! Must you follow and do everything a ""reality"" show tells you to do? And this guy supposeldy freakin' LOST! There's something wrong here folks. When society is reduced this low and forget such classics and Beethoven and Mozart Concertos, Classic rock like Floyd or Zepplin, even modern music like Dream Theater and Nightwish...there is something wrong with American Society.Just like with Potato Chips...you don't know when the frell to stop!"
1,Deja vu (like a bad dream over and over again!),"Wow! Can you hear it?? Listen - listen very carefully! The music here is the same as Kelly Clarkson's album, only with different lyrics and Clay singing instead of Kelly! Can I sue somebody??"
2,Overhyped mediocre debut,"There is no artistry is this first endeavor. Some of the lyrics are painfully odd and Aiken's delivery lacks depth, texture, nuance, finesse, and diversity. Yes, he is a guy who can sing, but he is not an interesting singer. He is certainly not original, nor do I get a sense that there is any real emotion behind the delivery. I feel like I'm being sung at rather than sung to. I admit to never being a fan of glory noting brand of singing, and Aiken only solidifies that conviction.I didn't find him interesting on AI and he is even less so on this debut. Aiken has proclaimed that he is not an artist, just a guy from a reality show. So far, he's confirmed the limitations of his musical aspirations.As for his sales. Well, McDonalds sells alot of burgers... that doesn't make the burgers any better quality. Nothing's wrong with those who enjoy a fast food burger, please enjoy, but don't insist it's filet mignon."
3,Clay is much more talented than this cd lets on,This cd is alright...average...i was disapointed that all the songs on the cd sound the same i sometimes i think i've been listening to the same songs for the last 10 min. I was also dissapointed that the back ground music floods out his voice. He is so talented and this cd doesn't let that show through. Yet there are 3 or 4 songs that i really like and would recommend it if you don't mind all slow songs.
5,Claymania,Buy It!!!... He's such a great singer he is my American Idol!!!you will not be disappointed.
2,Don't believe the hype,"I don't think this guy sucks completely but he is pretty overrated. I read articles saying that he is the next Elvis Presley. Hahahaha, that's funny. I can see him being the next Richard Marx but he's never gonna be up there with the king.Triumph The Insult Comic Dog said it best...""Ruben or Clay, which one to pick? It's like choosing what puddle of vomit to lick""."
1,HE HAS A HARD TIME BEING CONSISTENT,"Think back to the final 32 on American Idol II, all trying for a spot in the top 10. I remember Clay being in the group with Kimberly Locke and Ruben Studdard. Clay had this habit of over enunciating which cost him a slot in the final 10, losing out to Kimberly and Ruben. However, Aiken was extremely lucky, got a second chance, he blows us away. Now, comes his first album Measure of a Man....can I just say, if Clay were trying to get into the top ten with any of these songs, he'd be sent home again and hopefully, he wouldn't get a second chance. This first release proves to me that there should never be another wildcard again, someone more deserving, talented, and consistent should be here. Simply because a person has a range of loud and louder doesn't make them a great and consistent singer. I will give him Clay credit, when he is on, he is on, but he can only yell for so long when singing, that must take a lot out of his voice and it shows."
1,You will agree,I broke out in a cold sweat listening to this album. I don't like this album and you will surly agree.
5,As Perfect as expected!,"Just fantastic! You won't be disapointed! The ""true"" winner of AI2 shines!! There isn't a bad song on the album! I couldn't pick a favorite! What are you waiting for?? GO GET IT!"
5,Great debut from a promising young artist...,I found this CD excellent. I always enjoy hearing talented singers. The songs on this helped make my drive (I listen to music in the car) a very relaxing experience. He has a very good voice and a lot of natural talent. I think this was a great album to test out his wings and improve upon. I'm sure he'll only get better. I'm looking forward to his follow up work!
3,He's bigger than this offering.,"Simply put, Clay Aiken's voice is bigger and better than this CD. While the song choices are fine, they don't show off his talent to the fullest, and that is where the disappointment lies. What was Clive Davis thinking when he picked these somewhat mediocre melodies? Obviously, he didn't know what he had in Mr. Aiken. I don't think he knows what he has in any of the American Idols, quite frankly. These people can sing with the big dogs, why doesn't he let them? But back to Measure of a Man.The voice is a ten (at least). The songs are a six.If you love the voice, buy the CD, you won't regret it (you'll only wish the songs could match the voice). If you just love Clay Aiken, buy it, you won't regret (you'll only wish the songs could match the man).If you're wishy washy about either, don't give up. Wait to see what else Team Clay comes up with."
5,Measure of a Fantastic CD,"I love this CD and do not feel that 838,000 people are wrong about it. Why do fans of this CD have to take such abuse, i.e. we are tone deaf, don't know anything about music, etc. We just happen to like this CD and especially the singer, and are looking forward to many more Clay Aiken CD's. The boy can sing."
5,I LOVE CLAY AIKEN!!!!!,"I loved Clay Aiken the moment I saw him during the American Idol season 2 auditions (before his dramatic change) and has proved to be the best. I have seen him twice, during the American Idol seasonal tour and the Kelly Clarkson/Clay Aiken Independent tour and he just keeps getting better! My favorite song on his album is ""Measure of a Man"" because, I feel, that he is talking about God. I also love ""The Way"" because it's a really romantic song and the music video is absolutely wonderful. I HIGHLY recommend this CD to any American Idol fans or ""Claymates""-not that I am one. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Slightly disappointed,"I have to say, I too am one of Clay's ""older"" fans. (Just under 38). He has been labeled as a broadway kind of singer, and the tunes he sang on American Idol were true Clay (belt-em-out) style. I don't hear this on this album. I do like the album, but it wasn't what I expected. I would love to see him do another album, maybe of some show tunes or the like. Don't get me wrong, I could listen to him sing everyday, all day. It just doesn't get any better than that voice... Would love to see Solitaire on the next one. Also got to say I'm loving the articles. Way to go for standing up for yourself and who you are, even though I loved the belly shot on Rolling Stone. I do give you some serious credit. Fighting the big boys can't be easy. Keep the albums coming."
5,Simply the best,"Clay Aiken has a voice that touches my heart and soothes my soul. I love every song on this CD, so it's a tough call to name a favorite when they all gave me chills...and a few brought tears to my eyes. ""Run To Me"" is so very haunting and beautiful, and ""Measure of a Man"" and ""The Way"" are both touching and tender and exquisitely performed. An awesome debut, well worth the wait."
5,A Great CD!!!,"I love this CD!!! It is not too Broadway at all, which is what i was worried about. Although I am sure that Clay could have a sucessful career on Broadway, this album proves that he can sing pop just as well. The songs fit his voice very well and the album is very easy to listen to. I like Rueben as well as Clay and I don't see why you can't just buy both albums. Why pick one when American Idol 2 delivered two amazing and talented performers."
5,AWESOME CD FROM THE FIRST NOT TO THE LAST!,"Clay has captured the hearts of America, especially mine, from day one! His ability to sing any song well made him my ""American Idol"" and this CD is nothing less than perfect! He knows how to make my heart melt! Every song on this album makes you appreciate his voice even more with every note. I found myself eagerly anticipating what the next song would bring! Every song has a wonderful message and is appropriate for any age! I love his pure natural talant! I'm proud to be a Clay Aiken fan!!!"
5,CREAM RISES TO THE TOP,"It is evident that the previous reviewer who uses profanity - totally uncalled for - has used this forum to simply bash Clay. He has not purchased the CD nor listened to it. Let's grow up and use this for the reason it is intended - to review the CD, not bash the artist.The CD is awesome, and as time will tell, cream always rises to the top....."
4,A Good Start for Clay,"Clay Aiken has a wonderful soothing clear powerful voice. His CD is upbeat and fresh without all the usual sexual overtones found in most songs. I wouldn't label it as romantic, but it deals with relationship issues. It's an excellent CD to listen to in the car before work or while doing things around the house. It's one you can let you kids listen to without wondering what they might hear. With Clive Davis producing you can expect even greater things from Clay in the future."
5,WOW!!!!,"This cd leaves me speechless, breathless, just amazed. Clay's voice has matured so much since his first audition and this cd emphasizes this. The songs are beautiful. It's worth every penny and every second of waiting and more!!!!! go buy it!!! :D:D:D"
5,Best CD I have ever owned,All I can say is WOW! I think this is the best CD I have ever owned. All the songs are wonderful. I have already listened to it several times today.
5,AMAZING..,"I knew this would be more than a typical cd. It has more meaning than most pop cds. Compare this Clay to the likes of the world's most popular artists, ie, Justin, Britney, even going back to *NSYNC, and one will find that Clay has more depth and range than any recent artist. His songs are not bubble-gum, not by a long shot. They have so much meaning. They are all song beautifully and I guarantee you can listen to this through and through, over and over again. His voice is so soothing, the songs so beautifully written. He is definitely going places with this cd. He is no longer a part of the American Idol franchise. He has been able to break away from that and start his own path. Congrats Clay."
4,"Awesome, but not his best!","I love Clay and I like this cd, but it's not as awesome as it could be. It doesn't show off his voice which is a shame. He has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard and that is missing on this cd. Hopefully, his next cd will be better."
4,2 months later.....,"I bought this cd immediately because I watched some of AI2 and was mesmerized by Clay Aiken's voice. Truthfully, I didn't expect much at first, as it seemed to be a hurriedly put out album. (I expected it to be cover after cover.) But, the first time I listened to MOAM, I was impressed! To those who criticise the lack of ""edginess"", you can get all the ""edginess"" you can bear from some of the rest of those ""artists"" out there....So going on two months later, where is that cd? In my home, my car, my husband's car....you get the picture. Clay should win a grammy for this cd!"
4,a good start,"out of the 12 songs on this CD, i happen to like 8 of them. i really love track 4 ""When You Say You Love Me"". one of the stand-outs is ""Shine"". on track 8, a good song called ""I Survived You"", Aiken sounds good; but, i can't help but think it would sound better by a country singer. the three songs i didn't like as much were ""I Will Carry You"", ""No More Sad Songs"", and ""Perfect Day"" but who knows? i might grow to like them in the months to come. on ""No More Sad Songs"", Aiken at times sounds a bit like Tom Jones. ""Invisible"" and ""Touch"" are excellent, the CD's opener and closer numbers. Aiken has a touch of drama in his voice and his crystal clear vocals on these songs show us what he's capable of. now, next release, hopefully the mood will be a bit more up-lifting as a whole because i prefer to hear him sing mid/up-tempo songs instead of ballads...but he can belt them out, which you'll notice right away on ""I Will Carry You"" or ""Run To Me""."
4,Very good CD,"I have been a Clay fan since he first showed up on AI2. I had been waiting inpatiently for his first album. When I first listened to it I really enjoyed it, but as time goes on I am a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I think it is a great album, especially for his first one, but I think that they could have emphasized his voice better. I feel like it was more pop music and back-up singes than Clay's voice. Not all the songs are that way, but quite a few of them are. I buy Clay's CD's because I want to hear his beautiful, soul-stirring voice, but this CD leaves me a little disappointed because it doesn't showcase his voice as well as I would have liked. I would still recommend this CD to anyone. It is very good and I will continue to listen to it and enjoy it. I look forward to his next one."
4,Yeah for Clay!!!!,"I really enjoy the Cd, I LOVE Invisible! I heard it in concert, but I love this version so much....I've listened to it over and over. I would have preferred more up beat songs, because I tend to enjoy them more (thus 4 instead of 5 stars)....but Clay can really sing and has such an awesome incredible voice. I also have to say I appreciated what he wrote inside the CD jacket and all he gave thanks to:)"
3,Nothing spectacular,"This is the first CD that I have purchased in over a year, and had really been looking forward to its release. Clay has a beautiful voice, but in my opinion a few songs with a little upbeat tempo would have been nice."
4,Try NOT to like it,"Oh My God! I bought this album knowing I would just hate it. I bought it thinking that he was a cross between Neil Diamond and Pee Wee Herman. I? Was wrong! Aiken has chops. Major chops. This Aiken dude has incredible range. He hits them money notes brilliantly. Even though the lyrics are inredibly banal and unoriginal, Aiken rises above them. He shows incredible promise on this album and then some.Standout songs are Perfect Day, Touch, Invisible, The Way, and No More Sad SongsThrowaway song-Shine"
5,What a debut,"really thought for a first album this kid from north carolina that no-one even heard of a year ago...this was pretty sensational..wasn't sure I was going to buy it but they were playing in the music store..the song was ""shine"" and I really found it ""music to my ears""..now I can say that ""the way"" and ""perfect day"" are Clay's best on this cd..the song ""measure of a man"" is very good also..hope all the other skeptics out there like it as much as I do..would not want to see such a real talent fade away."
5,A Legend is Born,"Once in a great while an artist comes along that sets the world on it's ear.Elvis did it. The Beatles did it. Heck, people who grew up in the 80's can argue that Duran Duran did it. Now it's Clay Aiken's turn.Make no mistake that this album is Pure Pop Pleasure. From the very catchy kick off track ""Invisible"" to the extremely sensual closer ""Touch"" there isn't a bad song in the bunch.Clay's voice soars and stirs the soul. Measure of a Man is without doubt a triumphant debut."
5,Marvellous piece,"I am really impressed and love the cd. So great to have one in my collection. His voice is so marvellous and powerful. No doubt, his songs are going to touch everyone hearts. He is the one !!!!!"
5,Not a fan of American Idol...,"but I found myself really liking Clay Aiken while flipping through channels one evening. He may not have won, but he has won the hearts of Americans all over. I eagerly anticipated this CD. Bought it on release day and loved it immediately! Definately one of the best recording I have heard in a long time. And it's a CD that you can share with anyone and not be afraid of them being offended in any way. Here's hoping that Clay is around for a very long time!"
5,"""Measure of a Man"" is Excellent!","Clay Aiken can sing any song beautifully. Every song on his CD is beautiful and sung perfectly. You can always feel Clay in your heart when he sings. I recommend this CD to everyone. Every age group can listen to this CD. Clay puts his heart in to every performance (as always). For once I bought a CD where I can listen to every song and not have to skip through to one that sounds good because every one is good. My favorites: ""Run To Me,"" ""Perfect Day,"" and ""Meaure of a Man."""
5,Who cares????,"Who cares if Clay got his beginning from a TV show? Who cares if Clay is very effeminate? Who cares if he doesn't write his materials (that's a songwriter's job, not a singer's)? And who cares if he looks like Howdy Doody?THE ONLY THING THAT MATTER IS CLAY CAN SING LIKE NO ONE HAS EVER SUNG BEFORE. His voice just reaches out to you and when you let down your guard, it sucks you in and never lets go. If the world lets this one slips away, then it's a very sorry world. A singer like this only comes once in a lifetime."
4,Decent Debut,"Clay Aiken is one of my favorite singers from American Idol. My negative complaints about this album are: some of the songs on the album have corny lyrics and the album is overproduced. Overall, this album is a decent debut. Favorite songs: I Will Carry You, The Way, Run To Me, Shine, This Is The Night, Perfect Day, Measure Of A Man."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I am an avid fan of Clay, and in my opinion, this cd did not give justice to his talent. It was a big disapointment. The emotions and the magic were just not there. I hope RCA realizes that its the golden voice of Clay that gains admiration, and that they should not change Clay's style of singing, as his voice in this cd is just mediocre. I could not even believe that it was him who was singing..."
2,Disappointed,"My wife and I are huge Clay fans. We were both very disappointed in the songs on this CD, with the exception of the title song. The background percussion was often overpowering. We also didn't like the ""boy band"" type songs on this CD. The only thing that is positive about the CD is Clay's amazing voice (to the extent it can be heard over the background noise)! We hope Clay's next CD will be produced by Neil Sedaka and focus on Clay's wonderful voice, with only minimal accompaniment."
5,An Amazing C.D.,"Clay has an absolutely fantastic voice and ""Measure of a Man"" showcases his voice beautifully. Clay is a true artist and a natural talent unlike I have ever heard before. I will purchase any C.D. that he releases!"
5,a gorgeous cd,"Clay Aiken's voice is golden - anbd this cd proves it. you will get ongs with edge, ballads, feel good songs, angsty songs. worth every penny you will spend on it."
2,Clay Should Have Stuck with the Ballad Type Music,"Don't get me wrong.....I am 100% Clay fan....but....this CD was a disappointment. The songs are more teeny-bopper type of songs. ""David Cassidy"" re-visited. His choices of music on American Idol suited him much better. Hopefully his NEXT CD will bring him back to that format."
2,Ehh,"I know this guy's considered ""(...)"" or w/e by alot of people but I'll be honest, I'm a teenage guy and I actually liked his first single, it wasn't half bad. This new song ""The Way"", just sucks. And the video doesn't help either."
2,Can't believe how plain this is!,I am in shock at the blandness of this debut CD! I don't see the real Clay Aiken in the production at all. What a disappointment.
1,A total waste of time and money,"Oh Great just what America needs, another souless, overhyped no talent John Mayer wannabe. I haven't and won't buy this cd but workong in a record store I had to check it out and see what all the fuss was. The songs are poorly written and meaningless. Clay himself sounds as if he belongs in a highschool production of Grease. Don't waste your time and money on this. If you actually like this kind of drab souless music just pick up John Mayer's new cd, at least he sounds like a talented singer rather than a aspiring drama queen with a sore throat."
2,Clay's Voice Should Be the Music,"I absolutely love Clay's voice, and I couldn't wait for the release of this disappointing debut. But the nuances of his voice that make it so phenomenal are hidden underneath the ""music."" I would rather hear Clay singing acappella or singing just about anything other than these songs. Why cover up such a beautiful voice?"
4,Good,"I am a big Clay fan. His voice is enchanting. However, much like Kelly Clarkson's CD, Clay's CD is somewhat lacking. I feel that they could have done much better. Almost all of the songs are basically about the same thing - very Celine Dion-esque in a sense that they're very....""you're gonna be alright"", if you know what i mean. The best song in my opinion is 'I Survived You'. Bottom Line: It's a good CD, but a little redundant."
3,Clay's awesome talent deserved more than this...,"Don't misunderstand me. I'm a Clay fan and voted for him every single night during American Idol 2. His voice is out of this world. He can perform any song... His voice range is so diverse and pure that no matter the pitch of the song he nails it flawlesly. My real dissapointment is with the CD itself. I mean, Clay's voice is so wonderful that he deserves better songs than these ones. Even his interpretations in American Idol were better choices for him. I hope that for his next CD his managers do a better job selecting the right songs for such a glorious voice."
5,Measure Of A Man,"I love, love, love this CD very much!!! Clay Aiken's vocals are perfect and sings so well! Clay Aiken deserves a whole lot more radio airplay."
4,"Very good, but not perfect.","I really liked this cd, and lots of the songs were fun buy Clay kind of threw away some talent on the songs Touch, and Perfect Day. Other than that, it was great! Clay Aiken is kind of a geek, but he is still very entertaining, and I'd like to hear more of him in the future. I would reccomend it to lots of people! It rocks!"
4,Catchy,"Before I begin I must say that I'm a fan of Idols. However I only watched the final show of the American Idols in which Clay was a contestant, so I really didn't know much about him.Why did I get this cd? Well from what I saw he had potential. And I must admit that I was right. This cd is perfect for a gift for someone who is a fan of Idols. Clay has an amazing voice. Why did I only give it 4 stars? Well it's a good cd and all, but it doesn't have that gold quality. Don't get my wrong, I play this often when in the car but there's not a great variety between all the songs. 'Measure Of A Man' is definitely my favourite!If you're into this light-hearted, catchy music then you'll be right at home here. However if you want something deeper I'd suggest looking elsewhere. I don't regret purchasing this cd."
5,listen again to appreciate,"I did not like the songs at first but listened again and found three songs I really like- Touch (wish they would play this on the radio), Measure of a Man, and a country music sounding Do you love me?Look forward to hearing Solitare again soon!"
5,It's about time!,"It's about time an artist gave us music that everyone can enjoy. The pop music business, for the most part, thinks all people want to hear about are negative images. I have a feeling sales of this CD will prove people want positive music. It's refreshing to be able to actually understand the lyrics and not feel uncomfortable listening to them. Three generations of our family have been ""taken"" by Clay Aiken and can't wait to hear more. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Superstar!,"Clay Aiken will be around for many years to come! His first CD, Measure of a man doesn't have a bad track on it. Every one of the songs is suited to Clay's ballad style voice. I think it is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. Invisible, Shine, Measure of a Man, all great...Clay is here to stay!"
5,Even better than expected!,"Clay Aiken's outstanding voice and song delivery are showcased perfectly on this cd. His vocal power and range are phenomenal and the songs themselves are terrific as well. At long last, a person rises to the top of the charts who is in actual possession of real talent! At long last, a major label has produced a cd with the recognition that the content of the music can be mature without being trash or treating vices as though they're, indeed, acceptable. It's been a long time since I've listened to pop for the simple reason that I was tired of wading through the filth and innuendo to hear a few bars I liked. Clay Aiken appeals to true emotion and feeling. This only came out today and already, I'm anxiously waiting for the next CD."
1,EGAD!!!,"Listen up and watch that video for ""Invisible"" to see what pre-fab crapola Clay Aiken is up to. Remember when U2 had a spontaneous street concert and were shut down by the police? Well, Aiken's video for ""Invisible"" wants to convince us that his song ""Invisible,"" which isn't about much, has such political relevance and cachet that the police and a HELICOPTER have to suddenly rush in and hold the fans at bay. It's all calculated, guaranteed to provide his voice -- which deserves better -- to seem dangerous, although that danger has been carefully accounted for. Oh, Clay's not dangerous, except to ask people to open up their wallets for a song that is designed by a hit factory and make it SEEM politically relevent. Thanks a lot, Clay. If you were invisible -- oh wait, you already are."
2,the worst thing a musician could be----boring,"Clay Aiken is the kind of polished but staid crooner that fills so many hotel lounges.His voice is absolutely unremarkable, he takes absolutely no risks, and his music absolutely sends me off to sleep.The best word to describe this CD is 'ponderous'. Like any of Clay's songs, its so holier-than-thou it makes you want to gag. At one end you have rap thugs talking about pimps and hos and crack deals and AK 47s, and then this guy comes in from the other side, blindfolded, and then goes on and on about how good and pure and untainted and sweet life is...........Hello Mr Aiken, or should I call you Saint Aiken, do you not see how wicked the world actually is? And you just want to close your eyes and sing all your meaningless sentimental platter to a world that has already seen so much?But enough said. Don't buy this CD. Save your money for some real music."
1,Why?,"Why do people like this fake music that is written by people other than the person who is actually singing it? This American Idol stuff is uncreative and for impotent minds. Reality that lacks reality. I lisetend to a few songs on here and sure Mr Aiken is a good singer, but there is no way I will buy into this facade. I will only listen to real music, and what I mean by real music is musicians that write and perform their own songs."
2,Yawner,"My thrifty (stingy) friend who'd not even throw away month-old newspapers gave me this CD, and told me I could keep it. I should have been suspicious of this unexpected generosity...My hunch was right on... Every song sounds the same, stale, corny and sleep-inducing. I'd rather re-read month-old newspapers-unless I have trouble sleeping, then I'll whip out the CD and I know I'll fall asleep within 2 songs, or faster."
5,Clay measures up!!!!!,This young man is so talented.I can't pick a favorite..I like them all.I can't help but notice that a very few amt of those who wrote reviews on Clays album dtd'nt like it.No artist gets a 100 percent in his favor but Clay sure comes close. I've also noticed that those who say they don't like it really don't like it. Read those reviews too. It reads more like they are anger. Why do they express them selves that way? Could it be that they wanted it to fail? I'm a 65 year old grandma... not a clay mate..I'm a clay grandma and I love this cd. Grandma Pence
3,Somewhat disappointing....,Invisible is an amazing song....the rest of the songs don't really compare to that single.
2,2 stars only because I'm in a nice mood.,"I guess the big questuin is: can he sing? He is technically proficient, but that's not enough in my book. He's just another cookie cutter singer in a sea of mediocrity. He's got the chops but there's no feeling or passion behind it. The music he's given doesn't help matters either, but then again the cliche lyrics suit his voice just fine. What makes artists like Bob Dylan and Tom Waits so endearing is not their vocal prowess (or lack thereof), it's the personality they infuse their music. Give Clay ""Visions Of Johanna"" or ""Blue Valentines"" to sing (I know, Don't give him ideas) and the songs would be rendered lifless and as exciting as a used kleenex. Songs like that you can't merely sing. You have to give it something special and I don't think Clay would be able to hack a real song like those. He's just another singer."
1,Television Trash,"Is this what the music industry has turned into? As if the zombied brain dead haven't ruined it enough for those of us that know how to turn off the television. Music is about capturing the intangable, not fashion makeovers for the poor little geek. Explore artists with creativity and not this junk that is being spoonfed to the masses. You know you'll just end up using this CD as a coaster in 2 months anyway."
1,Disappointed,"Have always liked Clay Aiken, but the songs and Clay's singing style all sound the same. It is an extremely non-versatile and very boring effort. Compared to Kelly Clarkson excellent Thankful CD, Clay himself should be ""thankful"" that his fans helped him debut at #1. ""Measure of a Man"" is truly a disappointing CD."
3,Good...but,"I voted for Clay on AI, and preferred him over Ruben. However, this album is slightly dissapointing and over-rated. Clay has a good voice but most of the songs seem like typical fillers. Invisible is a corny, hokey song. Measure of a Man and Run to me, however, are excellent songs, and Clay shines vocally on them. But, songs like The Way, No More Sad Songs, and Shine are extremeley generic and boring. If you're a fan of American Idol buy Diana DeGarmo's BLUE SKIES, its awesome, and ten times better than Measure of a Man."
1,The Amazon viewer dared give an HONEST review,"Why don't you people shut up your attacking of ever honest reviewer and actually listen to this drab piece of junk. So Clay can sing and he seems to be a nice guy. That does NOT make this mess a good album. It lacks everything that makes for a good album like originality, emotion, oh and how about having the album reflect the singer. This album has nothing to do with Clay. He didn't write one single word and therefore it is nothing but kareoke, which is exactly how it sounds. You obsessed people need to get a clue. Clay is not the messiah, he isn't even a real musician. A good singing voice alone does not an artist make. There are hundreds of equally talented singers out there doing commercial jingles. Clay got lucky by being noticed by a tv show, however a tv show is all this is. Real music fans will NEVER fall for this"
3,One Song Wonder?,This CD is ok. Only song I really like is Invisible. Rest of it is bland pop. Clay's voice is not that appealing. Boy band fans will like this album.
2,clay's CD,"I was disappointed in this CD. Clay has a good voice, but this CD wasn't as good as I expected."
5,Fabulous CD,I love this CD and the more I listen the better it gets. I certainly got my money's worth with this CD. Great going Clay!!
2,Realistic Review from a Gift Recipient,"Hello, I was given this CD by a co-worker who wanted to Clay Forward with proceeds to go to the Aiken Foundation. I tried to be objective and as one who listens avidly to Streisand, Groban, and I am also a New Yorker who attends Broadway Plays, and the Opera, I was very optimistic. Clay Aiken is still young and has time to develop his voice. I was not impressed by this disc at all. It is light and popsy and not a very good first showing. I wish this young man luck in the future, he'll need it unless he gets better production help. If not, maybe I will catch him in one of the Broadway shows that I attend. He is at least THAT good.Thanks for the CD Sylvia."
2,What's the fuss?,"Invisible is a great song, the best song on the cd. The rest is just blah and sounds the same. Clay has a very nice voice, but this cd is just plain boring. Broadway Clay could never have become a recording artist without the AI hype. He's certainly no Josh Groban, that's for sure."
1,shameful.,shame on all you pieces of crap for feeding the well oiled machine of manufactured pop crap.......i hope you all realzie that clay's lyrics and beats were all written by 40 year old men......im not disputing that he has an excellent voice ......but so do miillions otheres..........the only reason hes popular is because america is a rotten pool of television..........i love QUALITY television........which is so so rare...........but by watching American Idol and prompted this garbage to number one on the charts..........you are destroying artists with actual MUSICAL talent who can play there instruments......my only comfort is that this douche bags 15 minutes will soon be over.......anyways..........support bands with some talent........thank you for your time
2,We are a nation of morons . . .,"It's hard to believe people buy this schtick. Between Mr. Aikens' overly dramatic singing and the really middle-of-the-road songs, there isn't anything here worth hearing more than once. Mr. Aiken might make a decent interpretive singer if he had more experience and better material. Maybe next time . . ."
4,"clay's debut album not exactly what I expected, but good",I just loved Clay's singles cd and could not wait for his full lenght one. I played it for my husband and he did not even know it was Clay for the first two songs until I told him. It dosent sound like him in some of the songs. It dosen't have that powerful Clay sound that we all became to love. Don't get me wrong its a wonderful cd but I was hoping for the same power in his voice like his first singles. It's like the made him change his sound a bit. I still love his music and will continue to buy it.I am sure his next one will be even better as he is so new at this right now.
5,Music Lover in Wi,"I bought this CD the day it came out in Oct and I am still playing it every day. I can't remember ever owning a CD that I would listen to every song and still play that CD everyday five months later! Well worth the money I spent on it.It is a shame that people are using this review area to bash Mr. Aiken because he is out selling the person that actually won American Idol. I didn't watch the show so I can't say why someone would feel the need to do this? I bought the CD because after hearing Mr. Aiken's ""This is the Night"" on the radio I fell in love with his voice. I am looking forward to his next album!"
5,simply wonderful,"I like this debut very much. Clay did not win American Idol but he is a success after the show. Clay reminds me of a young Barry Manilow. I like that Clay is a clean cut guy and that his cd and lyrics are clean as well, that's a nice and refreshing change in celebrities and music. This is a wonderful cd. I can't wait to see Clay's career flourish and I hope to see Clay Aiken have a wonderful career for a long time to come. He truly deserves it.There are no lyrics printed on the cd booklet and I don't think you really need them either, it would have been nice but its not necessary. You can hear Clay sing the lyrics clearly and fans like me can sing along with him. Still I wish that the record label had printed the lyrics, that would have been a nice addition. The cd booklet also pulls out into a poster of Clay."
5,I loved it,"My favorite is ""The Way"". Great song for him and he delivers.""I Will Carry You"" is another goodie. There are a couple of songs that seem a little odd for him (almost country-ish....yuk), but he still does a great job with them.Buy the CD!"
2,Generic Pop Fluff,"I was so disappointed with Clay's new CD. Not with Clay himself - I have been a fan for months and will continue to be so - but with the songs. Clay's amazing voice deserves a better showcase than these hastily written, one-dimensional tracks. I had heard a rumor that one of the songs would be Clay's masterful performance of Neil Sedaka's ""Solitaire"" - but it doesn't appear on the CD. It's the best performance I've heard from him, but apparently it wasn't ""mainstream"" enough for the producers.I hope Clay will be able to shed the ""American Idol"" moniker that is following him so insidiously. He is not your average pop star, but unfortunately this is your average pop album. Clay - and all his true fans - deserve better."
5,TERRIFIC!,"This CD is packed with absolutely wonderful songs, I can't stop playing it! There's a little bit of everything, so if you don't like one, just skip to the next track. What am I saying? How could you not LOVE CLAY AIKEN!"
5,Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!,"I enjoyed every song on this album. Clay and his producers did a great job picking out songs that showcase Clay's wonderful voice. The songs were all unique and I predict that there will be several number one songs generated off this CD. Congratulations Clay, you did a fantastic job!!"
4,It grow on you!,"At first hearing the album sounded kinda bland. But some of the songs really grow on you, just like Clay. Have a listen to ""The Way"", ""When You Say You Love Me"" and ""Run to Me"" - they're songs you can sing/sway to, and I'd certainly take this album with me on long drives."
5,SPECTACULAR!!!,"Clay Aiken shows that you can still sing songs without the language. His respect for himself as well as for others is projected very well through his music. I am proud to be from Raleigh and can't wait to go to a concert with my daughters, yes I am a mom. To be able to capture an audience of all ages is just amazing."
4,Miss Sue's Review,"This is an exceptional CD. In today's world, a clean-cut guy singing clean-cut songs is, indeed, rare, and needless to say refreshing. Clay's clear voice excels. His voice and the lyrics complement each other. As in all CD's there are some songs you like more than others. I have my favorites on this CD. I strongly disagree with a rating I read in our local newspaper giving this CD a D+. All I can say is ""to each his own."""
5,"***CLAY is hot....""THE""only true american idol****","Oh my god!!this cd is great..it has awesome lyrics,music,melodys,and tunes.whoever doesnt like this album is crazy!all the songs are spirtual lifting and they really touch ur heart!not to mention clay is so cute and has a great voice...he is a good guy.if you dont like him u have to like this grat cd..with beautiful songs!thank u clay ...for makin my day.....theres no mistakin,i luv aiken!"
4,It definitely grows on you.,"I am a very big fan of Clay Aiken, and I look forward to seeing how he grows as an artist. It does feel a bit overproduced, but at the same time, I'd buy a cd of Clay sing twinkle twinkle little star, just to hear his voice."
5,THIS IS AN AWESOME CD,"IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY BOUGHT THIS CD, YOU NEED TOO!!!!! Every song is so excellent and Clay's talent is proved over and over. Beat that Ruben! Also, The American Idol Holiday CD is awsome!!!"
5,Unbelievable,"This CD is absolutley excellent. I adore Clay and I don't know of any other singers with such a pure, and REAL voice. I just hate how singers today are for image. Clay's not about image at all, even though his has improved! Anyway, my favorite songs are The Way, I Survived You, and Measure of a Man. The Way is SO romantic, it's perfect, he sings it beautifully. Then I think that I Survived You is about how his biological father abused him when he was a child. It was obviously very sad, but it made me think. Then Measure of a Man was very good too. I definitley suggest you buy it!"
4,"Excellent, perfect pop!","This album is so perfectly done! Solid mid-tempo power ballads and that one uptempo last song ""Touch"", which does sound funky. It does have that late-'80s feel, reminiscent of what Michael Bolton was doing during his reign of hits. Clay makes you feel every word, every lyric, as if he's gone through those situations with his loved one. ""Invisible"" has that Bon Jovi feel with the loud, bombastic guitars. Would have sounded good in 1986 too. And ""The Way"" sounds so beautiful with its gorgeous landscapes. Liked the title song, the country-flavored ""When You Say You Love Me"", ""Run To Me"", ""Shine"", ""Perfect Day"", the Whitesnake sounding ""I Will Carry You"" and others. This is a star right now and he is just selling like crazy with this album! Hope that the next album is just as exciting as this one!"
5,"Unbelievable Talent - Great, CD for a new artist! WOW","Clay is an amazing talent. This has rapidly become my favorite CD. I listen to it over and over when I am traveling, which is all the time. If you enjoy listening to inspirational songs by a pure and wonderfully gifted young artist, this is the CD for you! Enjoy."
5,great cd,This album is just wonderful. Each song is a winner. The more I listen to it the better it gets.
4,"good, not great","As AI watchers know, Clay can sing anything. But his best performances (Solitare) were the ones where instrmentation was sparse and his voice, the star. Clay's at his best here on tracks(Touch, When You Say, MOAM, Perfect Day) where his voice carries the day; at worst (Run to Me) when the beat, music overpower the song (smaltzy over-processed pop). He deserves better than adult contemporary songs which try to dress him up as the new Micheal Bolton. On future outings, hopefully the label will let Clay experiment with more diverse songwriters and styles (maybe even something accapella, RCA?) that allow more of the power, range, and phrasing that makes Clay's voice special to shine through more. I do, however, love ""The Way""! RCA has a witty, personable star with a VOICE on its hands. Don't let Clay/his voice get lost in the glitzy world of over-stylized pop."
3,Good But Not Great,"This review comes from a major Claymate. I went to a release party on October 13 and couldn't wait to get my hands on this album. I was so sure it would blow me away...but it didn't. The songs are good and his voice is, as always, fabulous, but the album is lacking. When I listen to each track I find myself anticipating that the next track will be ""the one"" - yet it never is. This album could have been absolutely great if it only had one or two songs to really do his voice justice. Clay's album desperately needed a powerhouse ballad and I'm very disappointed that there isn't one on Measure of a Man. Don't misunderstand me, you will not regret purchasing this album. However, if you are like me and enjoy Clay most when he is really belting out a tune, you too will feel that something is missing."
1,another American Idol disaster,"Why don't you people buy albums by REAL artists and REAL singers, not these prefabricated generic posers.Try listening to the Aislers Set, the Clientele, Belle & Sebastian, or the Shins.NOT Clay Aiken. Not N Sync. Not Justin. Not Brittney. I'm not trying to be a music snob here, but this guy is about on the level of somebody singing the national anthem at a high school football game. He stays in key but has no feeling or uniqueness to his voice. And he looks a little too much like that banjo kid in ""Deliverance"", if you know what I mean."
2,Mediocre Material for a Stellar Singer,"What should we do with Clay Aiken's amazing vocal abilities and unique style? Apparently, tone him down, give him barely passable bubble gum pop ballads (with laughable lyrics), and do everything the studio can to make him sound as generic as possible. Clay, find new handlers!"
3,A bit worse than I was expecting....,"Not a bad album overall, but I was hoping for a bit more. It's a hard call to make. For example, Kelly Clarkson's debute featured Top 40 pop hits that were so far removed from her American Idol performances you'd think she was just another fremale star that made it up the ranks (her first single ""A Moment Like This"" is nothing like the album that came over a year later); I didn't care from that at first, but she turned out three chart topping hits. In contrast Clay's first release isn't all that removed from what we've heard of his American Idol performances, there's no major transformation here, it's just Clay doing what he does best. Also his first single (released months ago) ""This Is The Night"" is very much in sync with the rest of this album. In fact it's one of the stronger tracks, so hopefully this will give you some ideal of what to expect."
4,An average CD,"As a fan of the American Idol franchise, I can say that this CD does not measure up to Clay's voice. I listen to Kelly Clarkson's CD ""Thankful"" and I see a CD that had some effort put into it. However, because Clay and Kelly are separate artists, their styles are different. Clay's voice had ""soul"" during his performances on AI 2, but on his CD ""Measure of a Man"", I hear no feeling put into it. Songs like ""Invisible"", ""I Survived You"" and ""Measure of a Man"" are the best songs on the album. Clay, here is some words of advice, on your next album, dont follow what the music company wants you to do. You can sing very good and don't need to be poppy."
2,Just not the same Clay,I had to turn the bass all the way down and turn the treble all the way up just to find a glimpse of Clay's voice. This album just has too much clutter for a great voice like his. I guess I will just have to wait until the corporate excutives get out of the way for Clay to find his voice again. They must have thought that the music was more important than his voice.Can I get my ten bucks back?
5,Just what I expected,"This guy is the real deal. I expected this CD to be great and Clay didn't let anyone down. He'll be around for a long time. I hope to see him write or collaberate with other writers on his future projects.I think both Clay & Ruben have dealt with whatever controversy there has been with class and respect for one another, I just wish their fans would follow suit. The reality of the situation is... they both won. At this point, who came in first really doesn't matter."
5,Was there any doubt,"Clay is the new-age Frank Sinatra. I have listened to nothing else since I got the CD on 10/14.Clay is an amazing singer who appeals to many different age groups. In my home alone, we are 3 people...13, 40, 74.I don't have a favorite song as they all showcase Clay's talent. This album is well worth the money."
3,Just a little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed when I listened to this CD. It doesn't even sound like Clay to me. It sounds almost over-produced, if there is such a thing. I think the music overpowers his voice; however, I will take the advice of other reviewers and listen again. My favorite track is ""Measure of a Man."""
2,So-so,"Well many people have made this point. This album was rushed. Clay's voice is just fine, but this album takes no chances. in a word it's ""boring"" It is as vanilla as vanilla can be. Clay and his producers need to remember what got him here..Clay is a soft and easy crooner. What do we all remeber Clay for??? The song,""Don't let the sun go down on me."" Face it Clay, you're the next Barry Manilow...and what's wrong with that? Barry is still touring and his records are still selling. So Clay, take some time, find a good composer like Josh Grobin did and sing what you do best, don't sing what teenagers want because you know what my friend...you're past that."
3,Clay Deserves Better,"If you're looking for the powerful, astonishing voice you heard on American Idol in this CD, keep looking. The pipes evident during the run of the show, and frankly, that made us fall in love with him in the first place, appear only sporadically in this album of mostly forgettable fluff.Clay is better, and deserves better, than this."
5,WONDERFUL CD!!!! GREA JOB CLAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!,"WOW!!! Great Album!! I love listening to this CD over and over and over again! Thank you so much Clay, Love ALL of the songs, it is hard to pick a favorite, but I will try, I really love Measure of a Man, The Way, I Will Carry You, Perfect Day, Touch, When You Say You Love Me, Run To Me, No More Sad Songs and of course This Is The Night!!! Great job sweetie!! Clay will be making Christmas shopping easy this year!!! My goodness, I will be buying some more of this cd!!!!! 5 STARS!!!!"
4,Nice Job!,"I received this CD as a gift at Christmas and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised how good this recording is and enjoyable to listen to. If I had not received ""Measure of a Man"" as a present, I have to admit I most likely, would not have bought it. Only having gained my knowledge about Clay from the constant media barrage during the ""American Idol"" frenzy and having only seen the final episode of the contest, I really had not heard much from this singer before the CD. I do admit I was impressed by Clay during the ""Idol"" finale (and, yes, he clearly deserved to win as Ruben, although a seemingly nice fellow, sings out of tune). ""Measure of a Man"" is a solid collection of pop rock and a nice showcase for Clay's pleasant tenor. His voice, though a bit generic, shows some good stylistic touches that really help to elevate the quality of the material.A good job by Clay Aiken all around and a very listenable CD."
5,Music at its best,"This album is a must-own for all those people who want a role model to look up to and admire. His personal views and emotional convictions can be heard throughout this album. Clay's strong, powerful voice combined with the wonderfully worded lyrics make this project an essential to every music collection. Most every person can find a song to suit their musical tastes on this album. Up-tempo songs like ""Invisible"" and ""I Will Carry You"" start the album off just right. ""Measure of a Man"" and ""Run to Me"" are really thought provoking and amazingly real. And it's not just a few song that are great, but the whole album is awesome. I don't get tired of listening to each song over and over. There is always something new and exciting that I discover each time I listen to this album. I can't wait to see what other amazing music Clay introduces to the world. Until that time, I'm going to listen to my Clay Aiken cd again and again and again."
5,Well deserving Superstar.,"Clay Aiken is one of the most talented singers out there. Not only does he have a voice from heaven but is an all around nice guy. What I love the most about this guy is that he's not afraid to be himself. He doesn't follow the fads and raunchy behavior the music industry is so used to. Clay is so unique, refreshing and is a joy to listen to. I am a fan forever!!! I absolutely love his voice, music and of course the man."
3,Ahhh.....the hype,"Sweet little Clay Aiken. Well OK, not so little, he is after all older than me. Everyone loves him, he's the most popular idol ever. He can sing alright. And hold a decent tune. But his voice.............. ahem....well it tends to get a little squeaky at times. Don't throw your rotten tomatoes at me yet you Aiken fans. Basically, his voice isn't anything to rave about. Solitaire is good yes I know, but a more powerful voice would do more justice to it. I feel this CD is getting raves mainly because everyone finds Clay so adorable. The more he doesn't realise (or at least he claims he doesn't) how adorable he is, the more the American public love him for it. And oh girls they just love a guy with a big heart don't they? He helps out disabled kids.So this is your typical pop or ballad CD. Purchase it if you've fallen spell to Aiken, but pass if you haven't. It won't be a great loss to you."
2,Stay Far Away From This One,"Only the Clay-maniacs will like this one. It is simply horrible. I give it two stars, being generous, because I like Clay and I think he can sing. The material is bad. Did they MAKE him sing these poorly written songs? If you bought the single 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' then you bought the best of Clay, this I am sorry, is not."
1,This album deserves NEGATIVE 10 STARS!,"Why would any lucid human being waste their money buying this junk? This isnt music. This is contrived and manufactured. I don't watch american idol and i never would because it's a awful t.v show that degenarates everything good about music. The ONLY people who buy this are clueless teenaged girls who know ZILCH about music, and and middle aged woman who buy this for their kids to TORTURE them!! Way too sappy, way too bland. This is safe music for people afraid to listen to music that takes risks and challenges them intellectually. Clay Aiken should stop covering songs from The Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel. He's destroying those classics with his ""broadwayesque"" voice. The Beatles were actual artists who took risks in music and were innovative. Clay is nothing like that. Just another talentless popstar getting his 15 minutes of fame and then will fade away into oblivion. The sooner the better!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I never watched American Idol before this season (Season 5), but when I saw Clay Aiken doing ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"" in the season finale, I was captivated. He seemed aloof yet sexy, and I wanted to find out more about him so I decided to go back to his album. I was disappointed to find that not a single song he has recorded conveys the same personality I saw onstage - where is the mystery? Where is the charm? Where is the feeling? These songs are nothing better than manufactured, assembly-line pop drivel and even from what little I've seen of Clay Aiken, I know he can do better.Guess I'll just have to get my ""Idol"" fix from the original music Taylor Hicks has recorded - if you want to hear a finely-crafted, well-written, beautifully understated album along the lines of what Clay SHOULD have done, check out Taylor's ""Under the Radar."" It is simply amazing."
2,I'm waiting for the day...,"when Clay Aiken is freed from his American Idol contract and gets to do some real music.The only cool songs on this album are This is the Night, No More Sad Songs, and I Will Carry You. For the most part though, this album is a mixture of bubblegum pop and Broadway - ...which should never be mixed because everyone knows Clay Aiken dosn't want to be a pop star/teen idol. I don't believe his real fans want him to be one either."
1,UMMM,"Ummm, he sounds good and all but some setbacks. The first song sounds good but when listening to words it sound awful. Like someone else said it sounds like he is stocking a girl. His voice warbles sometimes and just other stuff."
2,Yuk! What Happened?,"I like Clay and bought the cd, but save your money and download the songs from the show, they are MUCH better. He is so good and this cd is so bad. What happened? Just a rush to get it out? You have the talent, just pick better songs next time."
1,Not worth Buying,This style is for broadway. The songs are blend!.. He will not last making those type of songs!
1,Ewww Eyeflutter!!!,"Ewww last night on Billboard Awards, Clay was doing that gross eye-flutter thing again! Ick! I bet he was pretty sad when Beyonce beat him out for Female Artist Of The Year. This CD is horrible and so is Ruben's. American Idol stinks. Listen to the Foo Fighters instead, you will be much happier."
3,Too Bad,"I eagerly awaited the release of Measure of a Man only to be terribly disappointed. Clay has remarkable talent; he was unfortunately misguided on this CD. The CD does not showcase Clay's amazing vocal range. I hate to agree with Simon, but prehaps Broadway would not be a bad place for his great talent.I wish him luck and look forward to his next release."
4,"Good for what it is, but could have been better","Okay, Yes, I'm a fan of Clay, and in being one, I like his music. I thought that this album was good for what it was. It was a teen-pop album. Anyone who watched one eppisode of American Idol, knows that Clay is capable of so much more. I do not believe that this album lives up to his potential as an artist. After listening to his rendition of ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters,"" this album lacks that energy. I would have like an album that challened Clay. But with all of this said, I still like the album."
2,Love Aiken Disappointed in Measure of A Man,"I am still a fan of Clay Aiken because he has a beautiful voice. However, the song selection, style of his ""made-over"" voice was disappointing. I was looking forward to hearing that smooth sexy voice of American Idol songs he sang. It was not there. Whoever decided on these songs did no justice to Clay Aiken. Maybe next time... Sorry Clay."
2,2 stars cuz hes ok I GUESS,u know that INVISIBLE song? he strikes me to be a stalker..lol this isn't really a song to sing to if u know the message behind the song....LOL scary!...im not a fan of the American Idol show but i luv to hear about the cheap cheap hilarious people that go on the show like william hung....LOL NOW THAT KILLS ME..really clay aiken i dont know what to say about you but that invisible song really makes me think twice about you
1,AND YOUR AMERICAN IDOL IS...,"not Clay Aiken. I am so sick of all of these people saying Clay Aiken is the ""Real American Idol"". If I remember correctly, HE LOST. Did you hear that people? HE LOST to Ruben Studdard by over 100,000 votes. I personally like Clay, I think he is extremely talented, and seems to be a genuinely nice guy. However, this album is just horrible. It's slow, bland, and just boring. All the songs sound the same, and the lyrics to ""Invisible"" are just a bit disturbing. I hope on his next outing he will have better material, he deserves better than this stuff. If you want to hear American Idol at it's best, go pick up ""Free Yourself"" by Fantasia. She's the best idol of all of them."
2,Stalker Love Ballad?,"""Invisible"" is definitely the creepiest song I have heard on the radio in recent memory. The lyrics seem to describe a stalker. Tell me you aren't weirded out when you hear:""If I was invisible/I could just watch you in your room/If I was invisible/I'd make you mine tonight"" and ""I keep tracing your steps/Each move that you make"". There are definitely some hidden messages running through the background of this song.. Quick! Hide your children!I haven't heard all of the songs on this record, but I have heard many (on the radio, watching Aiken's performance on SNL, etc..), and from them I can deduce that this is yet another generic pop compilation churned out by the bloated record-machine that is American Idol. Clay does have a great voice, though, which is a refreshing change from most of today's pop.Lyrically and musically, I give this cd a 1. Clay's voice brings it up to a 2 1/2, which unfortunately is not an accepted rating."
2,"Uh oh, Clay.","No doubt, Clay has an incredible gift. And I'll admit his single ""Invisible"" is a nice change on Top 40 radio. However, he would be better served on Broadway."
2,Whats going on??,I dont like this music at all maybe its just me and if you like this then you probably really think its just me but all music sounds the same well most bands not all but its just trash that we listen to and then after a few years you never listen to it. I dont know i dont have his cd and I'm not going to get it you can if you want to but I like things that are original
3,Not the Clay I was hoping for,"Okay, I know many of you Clay fans will be disappointed with this review, but my goal is to be helpful and write an honest assessment.I love Clay's voice, but the style of music on this CD didn't showcase the voice I love. There was too much straining and too much of a boy-band sound to the album. My guess is that teeny-boppers as a group may enjoy it more than some of us mothers and grandmothers who are big Clay fans.In addition, it was disappointing that the background music over-powered our Clay's voice on many of the selections. I wondered what the producers were thinking here. This is a voice we want to hear, not cover up.My CD found a good home with someone who will appreciate it more than I did. I am very much looking forward to Clay's next CD, and when the selection of songs is made, I truly hope that there are songs that will showcase his beautiful voice, and arrangements that will not obscure it."
4,Great album,"This is a great album for a young artists first. You can hum and sway to the music. Clay has a wonderful voice and it should be ""showcased"" better than in pop rock songs. I know he will mature and his next album will include songs that feature that voice like it did in his rendition of Bridge Over Troubled Waters."
3,The Sky's the Limit,As most first albums/CD's go the artist has just jumped in a churning flood and is trying to swim for air. Although this may not be the best it is far from the worst. Clay Aiken has an amazing voice - period. As he grows with the business so will the choice of songs. He is on his way up and will only get better because with Clay the sky's the limit!
5,Measyre of a Man AWESOME congrats CLAY,"This is an awesome album...way to go Clay ...We have waited for months for this album and now that it is here we are all learning the words and singing right along with Clay...Can't wait to see him in Concert, and hear more songs from this amazing young man. He thrills all ages..What an amazing ambassador you have..Clay is also OUR American Idol in CANADA as well..Please come here on your concert tour too"
5,"Great cd, didn't care for the show, but the music is good","This cd is great, his voice is infactuating. I bought this cd and immediately bought one for my entire family. I recommend this cd to anyone, who wants good happy music. Who would have thought me, a fan of death metal, glitch, and trip-hop would have listend to a clay aiken cd, and liked it.Of course i'm lying though."
2,Not That Good,"I gave this cd 2 stars and I was very generous. Clay has alot of things to be thankful for, mainly the vicious hatred of Ruben which translates into super stardom for him. Just today this runner up had a sandwich named after him at a local restaurant. If Clay was just a young artist just starting out and there was none of this controversy, there is no way this cd would have gone double platinum. I do like the single invisible, but it is not good enough to carry the entire cd. He needs more depth to his voice and to learn that he does not have to scream on every song. These songs are a collection of mushy love songs one blending into the other.I wonder how he feels knowing that it is not his talent that has sent his career sky rocketing, but a very generous case of affirmative action. Anyway he will get richer while we all continue to hate."
3,Good But Definitely Not What He's All About!,"A good, solid POP Album - predictable, fluffy songs. Should sell a few million and have a few great hits. Not at all what I expected though. No More Sad Songs, Perfect Day, and The Way are the most outstanding by my preferences. Touch is a throw-away I could've done without - I wish Bridge Over Troubled Water had been included or his perfect rendtions of Dont Let The Sun Go Down On Me and Solitaire from the show. Overall though, I enjoy it more with each listen.I look forward to him becoming his own and his future CDs that end up showcasing his true self will be more satisfying. But this is still worth owning and listening to!"
3,Too safe - Elton John meets Michael Bolton,"I loved This is the Night & Bridge Over Trouble Water, but I have to say I was hoping Clay & RCA would take a few risks on the new album. If you like adult contemporary, this album will be right up your alley. At times, I find it confusing as to what song I'm listening to, as they all sound very similar. Would I recommend the album? Just because of the artist's fantastic voice & shear talent, yes, I would recommend it. Would I pay $13 for it? No, wait for a sale."
3,Mixed,"This kid has a voice and style, but he needed a better mix of songs and a lighter hand on production for this debut album. Too often, he had to compete with the accompaniment, and this is unfair for a man with a voice as special as Clay Aiken's. He also needed a little more variety in the songs. I'd keep Invisible, I survived you, This is the Night and the title track and then mix it up a little, perhaps with some covers. Still, not a bad first effort - a solid B, I'd say - and I think the world will hear more from Clay Aiken. BTW, maybe he shouldn't dismiss Broadway so readily. It's not a bad training ground."
3,could have been better,"I love Clay but dont think that this CD is the best that it could be. He gets an A minus for his voice but the songs only get a C from me. Surely they could have written some better songs for him to sing. I think they tried to ""pop"" him up too much. He would have been better off with Neil Sedaka producing for him, too bad he had to go with 19 entertainment. He does sound fabulous on the Christmas CD, he sounds like the Clay we were all blown away by in the competition. Unfortunatley the songs that were selected for his CD dont show off his unique voice like they should have."
3,Where's the beef?,"I love Clay's big, powerful voice. Unfortunately, I did not get to hear it on this album, because the material is so weak.I bought the album because I enjoyed Clay's work on American Idol, but I will be more particular in purchasing his next album, checking out the songs before I buy. Give me something that packs a punch, such as Unchained Melody, please."
2,Is this the same Clay?,"Wow, this album is a HUGE disappointment.#1 This does not sound like the same Clay that we fell in love with on American Idol, He sounds like a half rate Boy George.#2 The production is awful, it sounds as if he is being backed by karaoke tracks.#3 Where is the soaring, clear and beautiful voice we know he once had?Shame on those who were in charge of letting this cd be released in this condition.It seems as if all the hype is put into the show, then all care is forgotten when it the time comes to record an album. Welcome to the real world Clay, I hope the next album supports your wonderful talent."
1,Overrated,"Unless you like syrupy power ballads that all sound the same, I would save my money. Mr. Aiken is overrated and over-hyped."
1,Wasted Talent,"Here is a guy with an exceptional voice. What is he doing singing boring, emotionless music that could be sung by countless no talent others on the BMG label. I hope the guys at BMG can rent David Foster to help Clay to get it right next time. Clay could be as good as Michael Buble or Gosh Groban if only he had someone who could bring out his incredbile voice."
4,Sublime Voice; Songs don't always measure up,"Clay's voice soars to new territory on this CD, particularly on songs like ""Touch"" and ""Run to Me"" and ""Invisible"", which could otherwise be categorized as ho-hum pop music, if Clay wasn't singing them. The lyrics are a little corny, but Clay makes them sound sincere. The vocal range of most of these songs is not very great, and thus they don't properly show off Clay's unique tenor to-die-for voice.I wish that the ""experts"" who molded some of these songs would have kept their involvement in the project to a minimum, and left the songs pure, instead of processing them with pop synthesizer sounds. I can hear that on any modern day pop album, and it is not very special. On the other hand, I can only hear Clay's voice on a few CD's. And his true voice is great enough that it shouldn't be crowded by synthesizer warble."
1,Best CD!!!,"I think the Measure of A Man CD is one of the best CD's I have ever purchased in terms of versility and enjoyment. It has some great break up songs, a couple with a light Christian flare, total melt down songs of devotion and a sultry, sensual ballad that will keep you hitting repeat.....that would be track 12!!!!! Enjoy, I love it!!!!"
1,I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH PREACHING THEY DO,"This album is not good. It's not the voice I heard on American Idol, the voice on this CD is not even good enough for Broadway. The power exhibited on American Idol is lost in this CD, I'm sorry folks, call it what you want but this CD isn't Clay Aiken. The attempt to turn him into a Pop King has taken away that beautiful voice. BRING IT BACK and forget about pop. Billboard may have said it is Pop Album of the Year but they forgot to say they took the voice away to make it pop."
1,I Was SOOOOOOOOOOOO Disappointed!!,"I love Clay Aiken to death, but I was really disappointed with this CD... I really feel that it is too commercial. I love his voice and he ""curled my toes"" when I saw American Idol. He and Ruben were my picks. I was sad when Clay didn't win, and I liked the ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" CD single, but I didn't like this. I won't pre-order any more... I'll wait to hear clips."
2,Doesn't measure up,"Ok, before you click on the button that says my review was not helpful, hear me out. I like Clay. I was rooting for him every single week on American Idol. And this CD really isn't that bad. But it isn't that good either. I can be a Clay fanatic and say it's wonderful and perfect but technically there's really nothing there. Every song sounds exactly the same. As I listened to the album I grew extremely bored because I felt like I was listening to one very looooooooong song. Clay is great when you listen to him in doses but song after song of the same melodies with his detached and emotionless voice just gets dull. And I hate what they did to his voice in most of the songs. You can easily tell they ran his vocals through a computer. He has a great voice. They should leave it alone. Maybe in the future when he has more control over his career, if he has a career, he can do things his way.The weakest song on the album is ""Measure of a Man."" That's pure dribble."
1,Good Try,"This is at best, a good try for a first CD. But, I was somewhat dissapointed with the selection of songs as well as with the vocal arrangements. The vocals could be a lot stronger coming from a talented singer, such as Clay. I think a lot of people are buying this CD and making a lot of hype because they are glad to see someone who does not fit the mold make it big. I'm sorry, I have to agree with the critics. ""He should stick to show tunes""."
1,Nothing personal at all....,"...Clay has an amazing voice...very clear and strong. Honestly, I just don't like the songs or his style. It's not that he can't sing. I guess he just doesn't sing the music that I like to hear. I was given this CD as a gift...why?...I don't know. It was a gift from a secret pal and I guess whoever pulled my name at the beginning of the year doesn't know me very well. If you like Clay's kind of music, you'll love this CD because he sings it well. Me? I guess I'm just more of a typical R&B fan. Love Ruben's CD...love Tamyra's CD...love Kelly Clarkson's CD...but just couldn't get with this one. Nothing personal. I probably just never should have listened to it. My bad."
4,Worth a listen,"I have to admit that I bought this album wanting to love it because I loved Clay Aiken so much on the show. I loved his voice and he seems like a very kind and good person. And though I won't go so far as to say it's the best album to come along in years, I enjoy it. I especially enjoy ""Measure of a Man"", ""The Way"" and ""When You Say You Love Me"". I am a little disappointed that he doesn't sound exactly like the Clay I heard on the show. It was that voice that made me buy the CD. However, he does sound great, and I would definitely consider the album worth a listen."
4,"It's good, but Clay could do better","I am a great fan of Clay Aiken, but the reason I like him is because of his unusual voice and sound. I don't think this album showcases that style and sound in the way it could. He needs to get more orginial sounding songs and stay away from the Backstreet Boys/trendy/pop stuff. He's just too good for it. Good job, Clay! But you can do so much better. Think Elvis Costello or Lyle Lovett. Two very orginal singers who have real staying power. Not poppy but real music. ""Invisible"" will be a hit but it won't keep him around for 50 years."
4,Very Impressive,"Before I bought this cd, I already knew Clay had an amazing voice--but WOW! Beautiful ballads, especially ""Measure of a Man"". ""Invisible"" was a great first single that got a lot of radio and tv play. No offense to Ruben, but Clay's single was much more popular, and I think he should have been the winner. Good job, Clay!"
5,Clay's debut is just plain great!,"Even though Clay was runner up on American Idol, he proved his talent and ability with this great album. If you like pop/adult contemporary music, this album has something for you. The album starts off with great songs such as ""Invisible"", ""I Will Carry You"" and ""The Way"", and the latter two will be singles for sure. The country-pop of ""When You Say You Love Me"" leads into the almost intense ""No More Sad Song"". Then comes the beautiful ""Run To Me"" and the inspirational ""Shine"". This is followed by the great ""I Survived You"" and Clay's #1 single ""This Is The Night"". Then comes a trio of simply wonderful tunes: the glorious ""Perfect Day"", the passionate ""Measure of a Man"", and the sensual ""Touch"". Clay's voice is remarkable on every song, and there truly is something for all pop fans here. Billboard didn't name this the best pop album of 2003 for nothing."
5,Totally Awesome,"Clay has a wonderful, unique voice which most singers do not have. It is hard to believe that such a beautiful comes out such a tall skinny dude!"
4,Great Album,"Like everybody else, I rushed out to buy Clay's Album. It took listening to it twice to start catching on to the songs. Like others, I wish there had been a couple more songs that I had known. There are a couple though, that I think will be hits. Congrats Clay! I look forward to your next album!"
4,It measures up,"Refreshingly different from today's mainstream POP music. Clay has a beautiful voice--but it gets washed out sometimes by the overproduction of the background music/vocals. I would love to hear Clay do the complete version of ""To Love Somebody"" like he sang it on AI. Although ""Invisible"" and ""Measure of a Man"" are getting all the airtime on tv and radio, this CD has other songs that I think are much better (try tracks 5 and 12)."
1,Cynical cash-in,"Sorry, but this album is probably the worst I've heard all year. It's so bland it's impossible to distinguish one cliched, tune-free track from the next. The cynicism of Simon Fuller and the whole American Idol team is exposed again - they knew that Clay's first album would go multi-platinum however useless it was, so have made no effort whatever.They clearly have no interest in developing Clay as a long-term artist. If they did, they'd have given him some good material so people would come back for more the second time. Here in the UK, the first Pop Idol winner Will Young has just had a massive success with his second album - in part because his first one was actually good, and the public were not duped into buying a half-baked CD like this which isn't worth the plastic it's packaged in. It will be interesting to see what Clay does next - if I were him, I'd start writing my own songs. Whatever his talent, they couldn't be any worse than the ones on *Measure of a Man*."
1,Big disappointment!!!,"Bought it and was a bit disappointed. I thinkthat Clay should stick to his own style andstop trying to be someone he's not. The songsjust didn't do it for me.Certainly not the Clay Aiken that sold platinumwith his first CD. Wonder how that happened???????Spend your money of something worth while, butif you just got to have it, burn yourself acopy from a Clay fanatic who is sure to havea few extras on hand."
3,what i think,"i'm writing of what i think of this cd . its a ok cd i will abmit clay can sing have some good songs on here and he seems like a nice guy.The only i don't like is what i read in the johnkarsan review what he said about kelly clarkson. i have to say kelly is not a fake she is the real deal. Kelly is the most nicest , beautiful, humble person ever thats haves a amazing vocie .kelly clarkson will be for a long time and will continue having hits like her renctly song breakaway . so please don't bring down her agian thanks and sorry if i offend anyone anyways good cd clay.i can't for her new cd coming out nov.30th and clays chirstmas one to coming out the 16th of november ."
3,Disappointing,"Being a Clay Aiken fan, I bought his CD with anticipation. While I wasn't happy with his first song on the radio ""Invisible,"" considering it the new Stalking song of the milenia, I hoped that the rest of the CD would be a chance for Clay to show us all his show stopping voice, charming manner, and hair raising emotional performance style.It wasn't.The song I most wanted on the album, which in my opinion, is the best song Clay performs, ""Solitaire"" was not available, and you need to buy the single to get it.Save your money for Clay's next album."
1,Measure of a man........Clay Aiken,"I had waited for a long time for this CD to come out and I was really looking forward to buying it. I'm no young kid (age 69) and think he has a beautiful voice, however, I was so disappointed in ""Measure of a man""! I was hoping he would have some of the songs from ""Idol"" or at least popular songs that I had at least heard before. I still think he has the most beautiful voice that has come along in a long time, but I'll tell you, before I buy his next CD, I'll sure make sure to look at the selections of the songs before I buy it!! I think he should pick his own songs next time instead of letting other people!!!!"
1,measure of a man=1 star......clay aiken=5 stars and more!,"Clay has an amazing voice! and I voted for him on AI, but this album just doesn't makes him justice, yeah this songs, well some of them have meanning and thats great but the beat and just the flow of the album is way too slow(and I love ballads and slow stuff also fast stuff) and this kind of pop music trying to be contemporary is just not for him, he is a true sing a true artist and he has an amazing beautiful voice, but this album is just not for him, maybe 'Invisible"" I think it's the only one that kinda makes him jsutice but the rest no, sorry Clay I'm sure you'll make it huge with ur next album."
1,just ok,"Clay is ok but he's no Fantasia or Ruben, and never will compare with them, sure his fan's say he's the true AI, but all I ask is where is his million dollar contract that they give to the winner's, sure we all know about clays padded sell's,(what else is new) but where is his industry nom, did they forget about him, it look's that way, maybe one day his writers will write him some desent songs, that people other than his over zealious fan's can say there ok, but that's about all you can say about clay aiken's music is it's just ok, anything else would be a lie."
3,Get's boring,Clay Aiken has a nice voice but after awhile the cd tends to get boring. He could have made it better.
2,Big Disappointment in Claymation!,"Wow what a disappointment! All the advance hype and Clay sure doesn't deliver with this cd. No excitment, no wow knock me over.... very bland. If he wants me to buy again he needs to really put some zip into it. This is The Night was on this cd and it was still the best maybe that's why he made a single out of if. And only 12 tracks......very very disappointing!"
1,so sad,"I see why clay was'nt nominated for a grammy, this cd is not grammy material, this cd is strickly for those who have bad taste in music, all though I think clay has a desent voice he need to get better writers for his music...but I guess all that matters is his fan's are happy, however Kelly, Ruben and now Fantasia there the real product, getting a million dollar contract is the icing on the cake, that's how you can tell the winner's from the losers."
3,Okay,This album is okay. It's not one of those that you would add to your collection of classics but it's not too bad at all.
5,Clay Aiken at his finest,"No matter how many times you listen to this CD you are astonished by the strength and purity of this man's talent.All the emotions are here, displayed with style and class."
4,A great pop album!,"Finally a male vocalist comes out with a pure pop album that just send me to heaven. There are a few weak songs that stops me from giving this 5 stars. But there are some gems here such as ""When You Say You Love Me"". Great album and wishing him more sucess."
1,clay is such a joke,"he might start rapping on his next cd and chances are you might hear him, ruben and pharrell do a joint together anyway clay's an okay singer but ruben was better too bad they got rid of frenchie davis to quote funkadelic the girl is bad."
5,AARGH!!!,"I PITY THE FOOLS THAT BOUGHT THIS ALBUM!! DON'T WANT TO HEAR NO MORE CLAY AIKEN!! IF I HEAR THE SONG 'INVISIBLE"" ONE MORE TIME...I AM GOING TO GO TO LA. AND FIND THAT LITTLE TOOTHPICK WHITE BOY AND BREAK HIM IN HALF!! UGGG!! DON""T BE MAKING NO MORE RECORDS CLAY!! I PITY YOU IF YOU DO!!"
1,I AM A TRUE MUSIC FAN,"I know good music when I hear it and this debut by Clay Aiken isn't good music. Additionally, I read in these reviews that someone believes Clay is receiving 1 star ratings because of his Christian beliefs. Hello, he has a POP album and I had no idea he was a Christian and I think most people reviewing wouldn't associate Pop with being a Christian. If this is the case, shouldn't Mr. Aiken be singing for the Lord instead of Pop music? Looks like Mr. Aiken is a sellout. I purchased the album based on his AI performance and all the 5 star reviews here and it is a let down, I feel totally defrauded by all this false hype that has been going on. Most of the five star reviews here are false, don't believe them or you'll be turned into a sucker as I was."
1,Ug!,"First of all, to the reviewer below me who called him ""a true American idol""--no, he's not. Even I know he lost, and I don't even watch that show. Next, his song ""Invisible"" is one of the worst I've ever heard. It shouldn't be ""If I WAS invisible""; it should be ""If I WERE invisible."" Plus, if you were invisible, you'd ""Watch me in my room?"" Mommmmy!"
4,Great!,I love this cd. I have found that I just want to listen to it over and over. I can't wait until Clay has another cd out.
3,Missed the Mark,"I thought Clay Aiken was a diamond in the rough on American Idol,he has an enormous talent that is not brought out in the songs on this album. I liked a few of the songs but on the whole found my interest waning while listening to it. He is capable of so much more, it's as if his promoters were in such a hurry to market him they didn't see the whole picture of the type of songs he should be involved with. I think he would sound a lot better singing more the style of the old standards than the teeny bopper tunes. Hopefully this is just the start of a very long career for him, he has so much to offer with his talent, I wish when Neil Sedaka offered on AI to produce his first CD they had taken him up on it, the song writers on this CD were mediocre at best."
5,AWESOME!,"Clay Aiken's debut album is absolutely incredible. Every song is good. Invisble, I Will Carry You, Measure of a Man, just all the songs are wonderful. His voice has so much range. The songs are ones you can listen to over and over. Buy this CD, you will not be disappointed. Clay Aiken has a refreshing sound and will be around for a long time."
5,Excellent first CD.,"I agree that the songs aren't groundbreaking AND that they are still great! Clay sounds fantastic on everything and I can't begin to pick a favorite! Shine and Perfect Day remind me a little of the Crowded House days, The Way would be a perfect slow song at a high school dance (swoon), Measure of a Man has depth and feeling, When You Say You Love Me has a fun pop/country sound with a beat that just makes you feel happy (would LOVE to hear the rumors of a Clay/Faith Hill duet come true)! I Survived You is wonderful. Each song just gets better with every listen!! I am really glad they didn't try to saddle Clay with a bunch of oldies. Maybe someday, but not now. I look forward to his next CD and hope that Clay continues to add ""edge"" and a little ""funk"" without compromising his values. Until then, I will listen to this CD until it wears out and eagerly await his solo tour!"
1,i'd rather pour acid into open cuts than buy this cd...,"i strongly recommend that anyone who ever considered purchasing this cd, spend your 15 bucks at arbys, because this cd is garbage. i used to love clay aiken, i even voted for him, but his ego is too large for my liking. this cd honestly would only appeal to deaf people, merely because they wouldnt be able to hear it. i almost fell asleep listening to it, every song is the same. maybe clay should consider flipping patties."
2,Next Time Pick Better Songs,"He just had to rush to beat Ruben to a street date, and boy can you tell it. You will be disappointed in these cookie cutter song choices. Clay can sing but I would rather have a cd of the songs he sang on the show, these are really bad. Believe an honest review and not a Clay-fanatic. There are three good songs on the cd (one being the Idol cd single This is The Night). After doing every daytime show, morning show and Jay Leno, he should sell a million copies easy. Remember a million people saw Gigli too. Buyer beware"
1,Michael Bolton Jr,"WOW, this album is horrible!!! How can anyone with a fully functional brain buy this nonsense!!! This is contrived tripe targeted to people who don't know any better. I can't believe this type of CRAP is what people call music these days. This is safe, middle of the road JUNK! Music is going downhill and it's because CRAP like this is what sells these days. Whatever happened to taking risks in music? Not just pandering to people who are afraid of listening to music that actually challenges and provokes thought.Stop being braindead drones america and reject this manufactured sewage that american radio and record companies are trying to pass off as music. Awful just awful.......*gags*"
1,Nauseatingly sugar-sweet,"Ulch, can we say ""boy band""? As much as I like Clay's voice, I have to say the complete opposite for this CD. With cheesy titles like ""I Will Carry You"" and ""No More Sad Songs"", this album screams ""teeny-bopper dream come true"". I've listened to each track a few times in hopes of maybe hearing something different and/or enjoyable, but no chance. 1 star."
1,Clay Aiken Who?,"That's right. With music like this he's already forgotten. And to Mr. A music fan from Phila, Pa, Clay Aiken's album was released at a time when there was no other competition. Hello!!! Noone good or really popular anyway is releasing albums at this time, so sure he'll be #1. I'd like to see him go up against Eminem, 50 Cent, Norah Jones, or even Britney will smoke him in sales and she can't even sing. So keep reading , Mr. Music Fan from Philly a.k.a ""Loser"", those same two and only two magazines that like Clay. By the way, my radio stations doesn't play crappy music like yours."
5,Can't get enough!!,"I ran out in the rain to go buy this album over lunch today and I would have made it through a tornado to get to this CD. After listening to ""measure of a man"", it only confirmed that is was worth it. If you watched Clay during American Idol, you heard the frequent comment about Clay's ""broadway"" voice. Well, he has toned that down and his voice is just candy for the ears. (not that it was ever bad) Also, the selection of songs on this CD are wonderful. The songs are ones that you can find yourself really paying attention to and can relate to. All I can say is what a great marriage of song and voice. Clay, congrats!! I am your fan!!"
5,Buy this album!,"This is a terrific album. Combine Clay Aiken's georgeous, soaring pop tenor voice with some great songs and you end up with an album you want to listen to again and again. On most albums there are a few good tracks and others that aren't so great, but every track on ""Measure of a Man"" is good and I am never tempted to skip over one song or another. ""Invisible"" is a fun pop-rock song, ""The Way"" is a romantic ballad, ""Shine"" is inspirational with beautiful lyrics, ""Perfect Day"" is a surprising and unusual ballad, ""Measure of a Man"" is great, but then so are ""No More Sad Song"" and ""Run to Me."" I am impressed with this first effort from a singer who - I hope - has a long career turning out music this good."
4,Jaan's Review,"Note to Jaan: The word ""discernable"" is spelled ""discernible."" Wrong again ! You really should read or research before you speak....or write."
5,Clay Is The Man!,"I think he is the best! He really is a STAR on my list and ""Shines"" completely in his new album. It's refreshing to have a talent like this in the music industry and I hope he makes another album. Absolutely heart felt and amazing."
5,Very Worthwhile Listening,"I normally buy CD's for one or two songs, and then burn my own compilations to play in the car.This is one cd that goes in the car stereo as is - too many good songs to choose only one or two.Good music, wonderful voice, crazy hairstyle - looking forward to the next cd from Clay."
4,Clay's CD a Piece of Dark Chocolate,"MOAM is well-orchestrated and extremely well-sung pop music. I defy anyone not to enjoy the blending of those two elements, especially on ""Run to Me"", ""Shine"", and ""Perfect Day."" The uniqueness about Clay Aiken's voice is that he can lift you to the heights of heaven with it.The only odd thing is the undercurrent of darkness in the lyrics. Clay can absolutely bring someone to giddy joy with his voice. The subtle angst in the songs seem mismatched, yet the whole production is well-executed; imagine if Hanson smeared on a little dark make-up and collaborated with The Cure. That and the loss of the warm rapport Aiken had with a live audience on AI2 can be a little jarring.Yet overall, the CD charms you with its own uniqueness, and there's no reason why you wouldn't buy one for your friend, and a second one for you when the first one gets too scratched from overuse."
5,Highly Recommended,"I am addicted to this CD. I thoroughly enjoy every song and find myself humming a different song each day. Clay's voice is beautiful and these songs highlight his range and wonderful earnestness. The words are clearly enunciated and as any fan knows, Clay can belt out notes with the best. A couple of the songs are reminiscent of Chicago in that the choruses are catchy and inspire you to sing along to them while driving in your car. My personal favorites are The Way, Perfect Day, Measure of a Man, Run to Me, I Survived You, and Shine. Several of these songs seem to tell a story and you can imagine them being played in a movie soundtrack. I have been a fan of Clay's since American Idol and I am so happy and proud of his accomplishments in this debut album."
4,Great job Clay,"If you are a Clay fan, you will like this CD - a lot actually. Song number 12 rocks--and should definitely be the kind of music Clay creates in the future. I am glad I bought this CD--what a refreshing change: clean but good lyrics. Most of the songs are a bit slow, but, Clay's voice is amazing.Thanks Clay."
5,Measure of this Man!,The CD was even better then I could have wished for! My only complaint is that I wish there have been more songs to listen too! Just listening to the CD makes my heart sing and my soul melt. It has all the flavor that a person could stand! Can't wait until the next CD is released! Clay just keeps getting better with every song he sings!
5,Can't stop listening,There is not one song on this CD that I have to skip. I love every single one of them. Thank goodness someone has brought back good pop music. And Clay Aiken has more talent in his little finger I think that any of the so called pop artists out there today. Good for you Clay this CD is a real pleaser.
5,Best Album of 2003,"I am amazed at the number of reviews posted for this album. It has become my favorite and plays once or twice a day in our house and/or car. Actually, had to buy two as my CD changer loader/ejector is broken and you have to unscrew the top, and do all sorts of gymnastics to get CD's in and out....it was easier to buy another for the car. This is an album that gets better with age, it grows and grows on you. It is an album to sing along to, an album to play softly in the background and an album to listen to with headphones. All the songs are good, I don't skip ANY of them, which as I (and other reviewers) usually do. Measure of a Man and The Way are probably my favorites, although Shine is marvelous - well, darn - they are all marvelous and I hightly recommend this CD to all ages. I eagerly await more albums from Clay and predict his career will be spectacular."
4,Really good!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this album but, it was a lot better than I expected! The songs really flow together well on this album and he has a style all his own! It may not be for everybody but I really like it!"
5,IT IS INCREDIBLE,"Clay's Measure of a Man CD is wonderful. I usually buy a CD and end up skipping 3 or 4 songs everytime I listen to it, but not this one. I love every single song. Clay has an incredible voice. My 4 year old loves him too. We get in the car and he says ""Mom, please put Clay on"" and I am only too happy to do it. He is a great role model, and we need them today. And he is singing music that anyone can listen to and love, from my 4 year old to me (34) to my mother (I'd better not say). Thanks, Clay, for being real! and for sharing your beautiful voice and attitude with the world."
5,Good start,"Whoever said Clay needs to sing covers of old Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mathis, and other older songs, you are wrong. Clay is establishing himself as an artist, not a kareokie singer. Singing cover tunes would be bad right now. I'm glad he stayed away from cover tunes. He is proving himself and breaking out on his own. These songs cover everything from soft rock to country to pop. He doesn't even have the same vocal styles as Frank Sinatra and Johnny Mathis and Barry Manilow. He has a much stronger instrument and it is used to his advantage in songs like The Way, Run to Me, Perfect Day, and Measure of a Man. Other songs, like When You Say You Love Me, Invisible, and Touch are more uptempo and sexy. Frank Sinatra and Johnny Mathis did not have a lot of range. Clay would only waste his voice if he sang songs from them. In any case, these songs are a perfect showcase of his talent and versatility."
5,CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!,"I can't get enough of this marvelous CD. I have to admit I play it over and over again, every day. It is mesmerizing.To those who say the album does not reflect this singer (i.e., he is not a song writer so he doesn't know squat), I say WHO CARES? How many artists out there today actually write their own songs and have lived every word of them?? To naysayers who do not believe a good singing voice makes an artist, well, I think there are about two million people out there who would tend to disagree with that assumption!!I have news for all of you doubters. This IS real music; music that has been sorely missing from the airwaves for years. So,you'd better get used to it - Clay is here to stay.AND I, FOR ONE, WILL CONTINUE TO BUY HIS MUSIC AS LONG AS HE CHOOSES TO GRACE US WITH HIS REFRESHING STYLE AND MARVELOUS VOCAL ABILITIES!Buy Measure of a Man and see for yourself what REAL SINGING is!"
5,"To the reviewer who wrote""Dont buy this CD""","Dont you buy it either Honey, you take that money and buy you some reading material on how to spell, or better yet, get back into school, its very clear you are brainless.As for MOAM, it is one of the most refreshing CD's to come on the market in eons, I can understand the words even, isnt that amazing!! You go Clay!!"
5,Wonderful and entertaining,"After eagerly awaiting the release of measure of a man, I purchased it after attending a meeting on Tuesday night. I listened to it on my way home enjoying each song. I would listen to one and say it was the best but then listen to the next one declaring it the best. My favorite on the CD is When You Say You Love Me. Each song displays Clay's talent as a singer displaying all of the ranges that Clay can sing. I enjoyed the CD so much and listen to it over and over on my way in to work and also while at work and on my way home from work. I did lend the CD to my daughter and she too loved it(I will purchase her own CD for her.)I hope Clay will come out with another CD soon maybe singing alot of Neil Sedak's music and even some of Barry Manilow's. Again, every Clay fan will be highly entertained when listening to the CD. Keep up the good work."
5,THE BEST CD!!!,"everyone MUST go out and buy this wonderful cd by super star Clay Aiken!! it will leave you breathless and wanting more!! don't delay, it will sell out fast!!!"
4,gets better with time,"When I first heard this CD, I was very disappointed. It seemed that most of the songs were slow songs. About a week later, I decided to listen to it again. The more I listen to this album, the more I enjoy it. I would have liked some more upbeat songs like ""Invisible"", but the songs are really great. It's a good ""middle of the road"" kind of album. My kids and I are having fun with this album but I hope his next one is more upbeat."
5,Great Album,"It's just such a wonderful thing to have an incredible talent now bringing us family friendly 'pop' content that we can enjoy as a family. And to have an artist that touches the hearts of 12 year olds, as well as 60 year olds, when was the last time we had this. This album will touch the heart of every member of the family, from child to grandparent, while being a new pop album. No one else out there can claim that now. And the songs on it are wonderful, the voice is so amazing. This guy will be around for many, many more years to come!"
2,Not happy,"The quality of cotton used on this product is not good. It came out of the dryer covered with wrinkles, despite the fact that I dried it on a permanent press+wrinkle guard setting. I must iron it and who wants to iron a t-shirt???? I am very disappointed in the Columbia Sportswear company for putting out such a low-quality product."
3,colorful but unimpressive,"My 5 year old daughter who loves teen titans got this toy today. She likes it, but she has no idea who the ""bad guy"" is, and i am wondering why the ""launcher"" can be folded out into a bridge, and what is the orange thing 1/2 way up the tower on the back that doesn't really do anything? The directions on how to play with it are pretty vague i had to poke around with a screwdriver to figure out why the launcher wasn't launching when i pushed the trigger. The trigger gun has to be completely clicked in in order for it to work (it does not mention that in the directions) Why no teen titans to go with the teen titans playset? the bad guy doesn't live in the tower last i checked. She's been playing with it for about 15 minutes and is now back to playing with her hamtarro house with her mr. incredible toy from McDonalds. If they had included a teen titan in the playset it would have been more fun for her."
2,NO DURABILITY AT ALL,The launch tower does not stay connected to the launch pad but for a minute or two. I am glad that I bought this at discount and feel bad for the folks who paid full price. My little guy has been begging for this toy for months and he is frustrated with it. I will most likely return this and purchase the t-tower which is a bit less expensive.
1,not worth the money,"My son really wanted this toy, he recieved it as a gift. The tower falls off if you look at it wrong, I will have to epoxy it to the base. It is expensive and does not come with any teen titans. Buy the figures and build your own tower/fort for them."
1,Teen Titan Tower falls apart,"This toy is absolutely terrible. I gave it one star, only because zero is not an option. My son really wanted this toy, and when he got it, he played with it for about 5 minutes, and walked away. Even a four year old can see how lame this toy is. It comes with a trigger that is supposed to eject some kind of orange ramp to launch a car. Nice concept, except the thing doesn't come out all the way, so my son ends up pulling the thing out. There are missiles that are supposed to attach to the side according to the instructions, they don't. The tower keeps falling off of it. All around, I can't believe how poorly designed this toy is for the money. You would think I bought it at the dollar store or something. I would urge all who consider buying this toy, to talk your kid into something else. IT'S TERRIBLE!!!"
2,Poor Design,"Surely the developer of the game had to notice that the tower would not stay on. I also notices that the bushes (or whatever they are)do not attach where they are located as shown on the box and they will not stay attached either. If I glue everything on, it will probably be o.k., but why wouldn't the manufacturer have just made the connection for the tower more durable? Toy is actually fun and hold my childs attention, if you can keep it together."
1,Disappointment!,"We were very excited to give the Titan Tower to our son for Christmas...and are now very disappointed. This toy is of very poor quality. The pieces will not stay together and my son has no interest in it, saying it is not fun because it keeps falling down. I wish I had kept the receipt so that I could return it."
2,OK Toy,"I have to agree with alot of the other posts on this one. Santa brought this for my daughter, who loves teen titans, for Christmas. The instructions, what there is of them, is very hard to decipher. The orange launch thing would not work and I had to take apart the little red switch that the control thing fits on to make the organge track pop out. (the red switch was not in the right position from factory). Even then the orange track does not fold all the way out. Also, like alot of other reviewers the tower tips over very easily. I just don't feel like I am getting what I am paying for these days when it comes to toys."
1,Teen Titan Tick-off,"I got this for my son because he wanted it and on tv the toy looked strong... But, the tower doesn't stay on and I took the advise of someone that reviewed the item and crazyglued the tower on to the base. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product if you can help it. My son has all of the characters to Teen Titans and their different cars he doesn't use it at all anymore, but he plays with the action figures."
1,the toy that falls apart,this toy is not well made it dosen't stay together. When the child plays with it the tower comes off the base. It is altogether not thought out I would not recomend or buy this toy again.
2,Falls apart all the time,My son would love this toy if it stayed together. All the parts come off. It is constantly falling a apart and that is not because of rough play. We have even hot glued it together which works for awhile.
1,Definitely NOT worth the money!!!!!,"My son is 6 and loves the Teen Titans. This item was on his Christmas list as one of his ""big"" things. As I was putting it together ""for Santa"", I was very disappointed at how poorly it was made. The sections wouldn't stay together at all. The little rockets/missles barely shoot out of the thing. In the back, there is a trigger thing that is supposed to launch the little car. Well, it barely touches the car at all. Not only that, the instructions were bogus and not very clear. For the money, you'd think it had lights and noises etc... Nada. My son was really disappointed. So, if you're child is wanting this try to discourage it. My son still plays with it but it's really not worth it at all."
3,Cool Toy not built to last,"I must agree with several of the other posts. This toy was very cool. My son is a huge TT fan, however this toy just doesn't stay together all that well. It is constantly falling apart and my patience in putting it back together is growing thin. Overall, the toy was played with for about 2 weeks and then he took it apart and put it away. My recommendation would be to find another toy to purchase, its fun but just too much work...hope this helps.Eric"
2,Not Sure This Actually Works,"I tried this brand of oil of oregano when the brand I usually buy only had the huge bottle available and I found that out of my price range.I wish I had splurged, though, because I don't think this product actually did anything; I didn't notice a difference in how i was feeling. I think it's worth it to buy the Gaia brand Oil of Oregano, instead."
2,Is there oregano in this product?,"Have tried the more expensive product from North American and it cleared up mine and my husband's stuffy noses within 24 hrs. Occasionally you would get a slight after burp with that product. With this product, I've been taking for a week and I still have a stuffy nose and never an after burp. Plus the capsules are huge compared to p73."
5,A beautiful book,"""Divine Chuckles"" is a treasure. ""Spirit""'s wisdom, warmth and humor has something great to offer anyone who chooses to listen."
4,The Best? Really?,"I'm not sure the ""Best Of"" tag is appropriate as this compilations is just tracks from three albums '87, '89 and '91. Really? That's the ""best"" you can come up with for a guy who first performed in the late 60's? Anyway, I'm a fan. Here he stretches out a bit adding some Afro and Latin influences to his always excellent musicality and musicianship."
5,Super!,"This group have crossed the lines of the typical merengue rythm. the lyrics and the musical compositions are so different and unique. These guys have a style and flavor that other groups don't have. I had the oportunity to see them live and ""MY GOD"" they are really, really good. their show is incomparable and their dance steps are a mix of the NY, flavor combined with hte true caibean Sazon. Good luck to you guys."
5,This CD is da BOMB!!,Elder is very talented and I know that he will go far in his musical career. Congrats! from Mari at SourceOne!
2,T-shirt shrank half-way up my torso!,"Ok, so I'm exaggerating a little bit, bit not by much. Where the Iron Maiden shirts used to be printed on Haines heavy-weight t-shirts, this shirt was printed on a Delta t-shirt. Shrank to the point where it looks like a belly shirt almost. Cheap, low thread count t-shirt. When ordering these rock shirts, be sure to ask the seller what kind of shirt it's been printed on. If you're like me, you like to keep your rock shirts around until they get nice and faded. The DELTA shirts won't last that long. The eact same thing happened with a new RIde the Lightning shirt, and I'm a little frustrated. The HAINES and GIANT brand shirts tend to be high quality and don't shrink. *Please note that this is not an issue with the seller, but with whomsoever is making Maiden's licensed stuff now."
5,Old School Metal!,"Love this band&ALWAY'S WILL,Seen him a dozen times&will continue to do so along with my teenage Son,rather take him to see an old school metal band than a rapper any old night!"
3,useful but needs improvement,"There are so many books on Struts out there these days that it is very difficult to find a good one. I tend to learn best by example, so I found this book useful. I think it could be improved in two ways:1. Examples can be more cohesive.2. Authors should not resort to a proprietary toolkit in their presentation."
2,Aggravating,"The first part of this book started off pretty good. I was able to do and understand the simple login application. After that, it made me feel pretty stupid. I completely lost focus due to lack of examples and the ever compounding lecture on tough topics. When it came to the final Artimus application, which is basically a huge conglomeration of just about every possible thing you can do, I was completely lost and couldn't get it working with WSAD. I gave up, i'm getting a different book."
1,Not worth it,"Listen to the other reviews. This book is just an encyclopedia of waste. At least an encyclopedia has pictures and examples; this book has neither. After the first 2 chapters, it's all downhill. It is a very frustrating read because there are absolutely no examples. It's all theory. Don't waste your money and don't listen to all the fancy quotes on the book's back cover. This book just doesn't cut it."
2,Could have been,"A book from the author of Struts, can you possibly go wrong? This book shows you can. The book does not have a flow to it, to me it seems just scattered topics piled on eachother. And then, the grand finale, where all you have ""learned"" is applied in a real world type of thing... By the time it got there, I got so annoyed I did not care anymore. The examples rely on so much non-standard struts stuff, I have trouble with the title even."
2,Imcomplete and poorly written,"I have purchased and read alot of programming books, and by far this is one of the worst prepared books I have seen. The author drags out the developement of a simple login system over 4-5 chapters. Thank God he provided the code on the web server, as he only give complete code listings on certain classes, and leaves the reader to piece together other classes. After chapter 5 I put it down and went back to the ORielly series were I actual learned something. The book has the information in it if you can put up with the repetive approach and fragmented code. Please re-think and re-write. Not a book for the first time strut user."
1,TOTAL LET DOWN - FULL OF ERRORS,"Book is incomplete and full of errors, even simple errors where toString is in the code and not used properly and throws an error - he left off the ""()"". And we are supposed to learn from someone who can not use toString? The code from web site does not compile per book instructions. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this, no matter what the paid-reviewers say. This is one of the worst written book, code fragments and no full listing of code. The site provides code that does not compile correctly with vague insrtuctions as if it were going to actual work. Stick with O'Reilly series. Please Ted Husted, find another profession..... ( I picked 1 star because zero was not an otpion)"
3,devil in details,"This book is a good introduction to struts. It explains well about the architecture and concept. The problem is that it does not explain the details well and some of the examples are just wrong. Especailly if you are looking for version 1.1 info. I think that the book was put together in a hurry. It is better than the documentation in Apache's website but still far away from being a 5-star book. ... If you are new to Struts, you will still have to spend a lot of time to figure out the details yourself. Also the 'Programming Jakarta Struts' book from O'Reilly is disappointing.I wish the author could spend more time on the details and gave accurate and complete examples not just pieces here and there."
3,Struts Good. Book full of Errors.,"Struts is a great framework, but there is a shortage of good documentation. This book is written in a nice style, but there are far too many errors to give it a good rating."
2,Ordinary Stuff!,"Not impressed with the Authors' writing style, at points it really puts you off. Not very good use of wordings/language. You feel it a lot especially when you are an active reader and read good material from good sources."
1,Complete waste of money,"If I have to rate this book, I would rate it below 1 star. This is complte waste of money and I would suggest DON'T waste your money on this. If you really want to buy book on Struts, go for the one which O'Reilley has. Apart from numberous errors, this book doesn't cover anything new other then just basic and that too is not worth reading it."
3,"Good start, bad finish, mediocre middle","I very much enjoyed the first eight chapters of this book with the first four being the meat of what Struts is all about. The remainder, however, seemed a bit disjointed and haphazardly put together. My biggest criticism of this book is the 18 pages of errata available on-line which itself has some errata. I would have expected a more polished tome of this detail and length."
2,No longer worth reading,"This book is woefully out of date with respect to both struts and the extension packages that the author created and published. Most if not all are deprecated and standard struts components are available to replace them. I made the mistake of developing code for Struts 1.3 using this book as a reference and will end up rewriting the application as a result. There was probably a time where this book made sense and it may have value as a historical reference, particularly to the author's extensions. But there is no good reason to have this book as your Struts reference."
1,Real Bad Book,I've read it over and over and I can't understand anything. Struts Html Tags are glossed over without examples. Just 2 lines on how to use the tags but the object/bean that it refers to is left to your imagination. If you understand the javadoc that comes with Struts then this will be clear to you but then you don't need a book. The O'reilly book is 1000 times better.Serves me right for buying a book without browsing and just relying on the reviews.
3,"Good introduction, but not enough","It compares Struts 1.0 and 1.1 very clearly, if you care.I have some questions about something like how to use Exception Handler, how to use multiple message-resources... Unfortunately, I only got some concept explaination, but no more detail and code sample."
3,Too complex,"I need to learn struts asap... this book while being highly recomended by professionals who have previous experience with struts, is of no use for the begginer. it takes you into a great deal of details while not giving you a quick example for you to start coding... jakarta struts for dummies was the most helpful to me. it had small segments of code and line by line explanation."
4,"Better than most, but no Struts book seems to cover it all","When I needed to learn Struts, I went first to the online doc, but found it wanting. I then went to the O'Reilly book on the subject, assuming it would be as good as other O'reilly material, but it just wasn't. I did my due diligence and picked Ted Husted's Struts in Action, and I haven't regretted it at all. It covers what needs to be covered, in a methodical logical fashion. Sadly, this is more than I can say for most tech books, not just the ones on Struts. Virtually every Struts book I looked at covered some things I didn't want to know about and left out stuff about things critical to me. Struts in Action was a valuable learning tool and continues to serve as a great reference."
4,Informative,"Although the book has lots of information and has many details, there's really no substitute for actually programming a MVC application with Struts. Struts is simple enough that most of what it offers can be learned by writing applications and looking at the API, which is open-source. The fine grained minutia is not in the book and has to be discovered manually. But, if you own his book, you can just ask Ted!Also, before embarking on a trip with Struts as the framework, it is vital to understand the MVC pattern. That pattern has its advantages and its disadvantages."
4,Close...But not perfect,"We were given the task to design an enterprise application. Of course, ya need a framework and where else do you turn? Struts! This book was one of the better I looked at when it came to concise, clear, and detailed information. It explains why to develop with struts and gives an explaination of how to develop an overall structure that is worth every penny. BUT ... I sure do like examples and, although there are quite a few, none really give the ENTIRE process from A to Z. That would have helped even more! The examples you get are A-C, then G-L, then P-Z. So the info is there, you just need to understand how to implement it."
1,A Not So Nice Song From A Not So Nice Spice,"Will the real Melanie C please stand up? From athletic, hyper, popster, to cursing, loud, rock chick. Personally I find the new Melanie C to be annoying and way over the top. Not only is this song poorly written, but it's poorly sung, poorly orchestrated, and just poor overall. C'mon now Melanie dont you think you could do a little better than this?"
1,absolutely tasteless song for a tasteless Spice!,Get a life Melanie C and I think you are better of with the Spice Girls where we cannot hear your annoying voice!! And please stop being ARROGANT. A one star is really too much for it! A minus five stars would be fair.
5,Melanie is the best!!!,"I don't know why I took so long to buy this single or any of Melanie's other singles.I think Melanie is the best artist out there, I've loved her and her music since her spice girl days.This album is great.I really love ""Angel on my Shoulder,"" its a nice touching song.I would also recommend buying the Goin' Down CD 2(if you don't already have it) because ""I Want You Back"" is the greatest song ever.It's my fave and if you haven't heard it, you should."
3,reading 7 for number 11,"I purchased this talking watch, along with another -also talking- for an elderly of 85 and BLIND. The watches are quite beautiful, well designed and fit for its purpose of telling the time. Until, by accident, I discovered that it announces ""seven"" for the number 11, be it hours, minutes, am, pm. In disbelief, I discovered that the other (talking)watch I just bought is ALSO doing the same.I've notified the vendor and Amazon for further investigation: fabrication defect or design flaw.NOT, I'm pleased, NOT Made in USA."
4,Talking Watch,"The watch speaks the time clearly, and it is easy to set. What I didn't like was that the watch is not water resistant.The company that actually sells the watch (Maxiaids) is outstanding. I had a problem after receiving the watch, and they exchanged it with absolutely no hassles. They even paid for the return postage."
3,A little hard to understand,"My 97 yr old grandfather likes it, although he finds the female voice difficult to understand on certain times. Once he got used to it, he knows what time it is, regardless. Works as advertised."
4,Works for me,"Actually, it was a stocking stuffer for a blind friend who also has the problem of low sensation in his hands. The design passed his test because he could use it. I couldn't say that for other products that are designed for the blind yet didn't work in a design sense."
3,It's okay...,"It kind of reminds me of PAC-MAN. Running in a tunnel with giant face of a cat. It's a great kids game. But kind of redundant for an adult. So unless you loved this as child, or if it's for a child, I don't really recommend it. They put out another game like this called ALIEN released by FOX games for the Atari 2600 about the movie.-Thanks"
4,Don`t listen to the review...,This album jams! Yes it is old school influenced but it is a lot catchy fresh techno-pop JAM!
4,Get out your roller skates!,"This is one of my favorite CDs that I've heard in the last year. If you don't end up loving it, you're at least guaranteed to think it's pretty funny.This is just one of those records you can't really intellectualize. You hear it, you love it or you hate it. It's all about fun fun fun and, for me, took no work at all to enjoy or ""get into"".For the late 90's, this was a very bold album to produce. So much pressure is put on electronic artists to sound absolutely new and completely groundbreaking, and this record isn't only tinged with 80's influences-- it often sounds like it was made IN the 80's.Most of these tracks are wonderful, I only find two to be unlistenable ""Soft Machine"" and ""From: Disco To: Disco"". The second to last, ""Sometimes"" is one of the most-played songs in my apartment.Get this CD!"
2,"Works fine, but expensive","The filter works fine, and I was about to order another. I paid $5.75 for it 7 months ago, and now it is almost $30. I mean we all expect to pay a little more when we buy items later on, but more than 5 times as much?"
2,Works but HUGE price jump!,"I purchased two of these filters severals months back. And am now seeking to replace my last filter. I agree, the filter does the job; however, I didn't pay $30.00 per filter. Am now considering on trading out my Bosch for a bagless euro shark."
5,Wonderful,I have a 10mth old girl and she just loves this book. I found the seller great to purchase with. I had no hassel at all. Makes buying fun when you don't have to worry about delays.
3,"Only watched Knots and Crosses, hope the rest are better","Let me state first that I am a fan of Ian Rankin and have read almost all of the Rebus novels. I tried watching Knots and Crosses this weekend. It is LOOSELY based on the first novel, but completely omits the past of Rebus. I dont think 67 minutes is enough time to properly portray the novel. Furthermore, while the acting is excellent, I just cant see Ken Stott as Rebus. If you've read the novels, I think you will be disappointed also. If you havent read them, give them a shot. As for me, I dont know if I will watch the rest."
4,Great disc,"This disc was played everyweekend at our parties, so much so it was almost a ritual. Not quite as good as Love Machine but still an awesome disc."
1,No Thanks!,"Maybe this movie is okay for the art-house crowd, or those interested in mental illness, but for me, it was just plain boring. Didn't do a thing for me. Unwatchable. I've seen worse, but wish I'd known what type of ""comedy"" this really was before we paid for the rental.Not recommended."
1,Awful,Horrible movie. I didn't even finish watching it. It reminded me of a low-budget B-movie and that is being charitable.
1,Special,I found this movie slow paced. The plot failed to catch and keep my attention. I am glad I did not buy this title.
3,just okay,"I'm not sure why, but I expected more from this movie. It had potential, though it never quite made it the acing was fine I just did not care so much for the story. The moral behind the story was very good and I did not mind watching it for free"
3,"Quirky, strange but interesting","I don't want to give details here because it would spoil the movie for you. I just want to say that this was an interesting, creative movie. It wasn't at all what I expected from reading the DVD cover. There was a twist I can't go into detail about without giving a spoiler. Regardless, I found myself very interested all the way through. Watching this movie was kind of like working on a puzzle, and the viewer has to solve it. The lead actor was excellent and the story was, well... strange but intriguing. I don't know anything about the behind the scenes issues with this movie, but I'd guess it was low budget, independent film because of the style of shooting and the quirkiness of the story. I would say that this would be a movie to rent if you have already seen those on the top of your list."
1,Not worth 1 star,This book is not worth the poor trees that died or it.The Chandlers are con-artists and bullies. Save your money and seek the truth.
1,12 years too late,"If it wasn't already evident that the 1993 child abuse allegations were based on money (greed) then the release of this ''tell all'' book certanly clarifies the situation. Let me tell you if my nephew (or any other relative for that matter) had ever being abused (whether or not it was by a celebrity or not) I AM NOT going to release a book which will bring myself ecomic gain at the expense of my ''damaged'' nephew.This book is full of half truths and whole lies, it amazes me that in ''the home of the brave'' the only way to make a buck is by capitalizing off somebody elses ''missfortune''.This book is 12years past its sell-by date and the odour is overpowering, the only place for this book is in the trash"
1,Trash the book!,The book is all nonsense. Want to read a book about Michael? Read Letters to Michael Jackson.
1,All That Glitters The Crime and The Coverup,I was just wondering if I could please have my money back. When is this man going to confess that his brother worte this while the whole thing was going on if not before.All I can say is YUCK.
1,You really shouldn't believe everything you read!,"To the reviews that are claiming this book is the absolute truth, how do you know? You have a Uncle here that has not talked to this kid in over 12 years? Was not in the picture when the kid was hanging out with Mr. Jackson. You have a family here that extorted money from Michael jackson plain and simply. Thats why this kid now an adult refused to testify in the 2005 court case. To the readers who really believe this book ask yourself if my child was molested would I take $20 million and let the person run free to molest others? I for sure wouldn't! Food for thought!"
4,Better than I thought,"I would consider myself a ""radio"" Damn Yankees fan, having only heard their radio hits like, ""Don't Tread on Me,"" and, ""High Enough."" After hearing this Essentials CD though, I see that there's more than meet's the ear. The only song on here that I can't seem to get into is, ""Come Again,"" but all the others are real rockers for me. From the milder, ""Silent is Broken,"" to the fast and heavy, ""Piledriver,"" this CD never stops! The guitars, vocals, bass, and drums, all rock. I tend to give conservative ratings, so that's why I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars, but otherwise, I would highly recommend it for any other ""radio"" fans like myself."
1,What a waste of time,"This book is a total waste of time an money. I have to read it with my English class for 7th grade and it is just plain stupid. Trust me there is alot of other books out there that are much better than this. This is the worst book I have read in years. It is just so unrealistic, Beowulf defeating a monster Grendel (which has already killed hundreds of men) not using his sword but his own hands ?!? How naive and stupid is that? Besides I think I heard a story like this a hundred times before. Trust me, you don't want to waste your time, or your monwy on this book."
2,Fun. But wildly dissimilar.,"In many ways, this Beowulf is a lot of fun for kids. The writing is direct and clear (although there are plenty of vocabulary stretchers). The action is fun. Beowulf's heroism is unquestionable.But, I don't understand why one would publish a Beowulf retelling and stay just close enough to the original to be confusing (as opposed to John Gardner's wonderful Grendel, which told the story from the monster's perspective). The most disturbing divergence was making Unferth a petty bad guy in enamored of evil. In doing so, Nye sacrifices much of the nobility of the original.I don't know if there are other kid-friendly tellings of this story. But, I would look for one of those, first."
1,Do not be deceived!,"This version of ""Beowulf"" should NOT be compared, at all, to the original text of ""Beowulf"". Students should not be taught that THIS story, as re-created by Robert Nye, is reflective of the ""Beowulf"" written about 1000 AD. The story developed and shared for hundreds of years is characterized by Christian concepts and ideals. This version, written by Robert Nye, reflects our societies overwhelming desire to rewrite history, de-Christianizing it as they go along. Robert Nye has replaced the Christian God of the original ""Beowulf"" with the mythological Viking god ""Odin"". The original ""Beowulf"" tale supports the historical significance that Christian beliefs and ideas had on the overall society of England and throughout Europe. Robert Nye has done a great injustice in adjusting an historical document to reflect his own convictions, or lack thereof."
4,Beowulf: A New Telling,"I used this book with my sixth grade class to explore our theme of ancient heroes. Nye's retelling kept my class totally entranced with Beowulf and his adventures. ALthough it does not follow the original it does introduce young students to the hero, and those students who were more enthralled read other versions. When Nye's retelling is compared with the orginal it opens up discussions...even for sixth graders!!"
4,Good way to introduce a classic to students,"As an English teacher, I do not like reading abridged and ""translated"" versions of books; however, Robert Nye does capture the essence of the story in a way that holds students' attention. Furthermore, his version allows me to engage the students in occasional excerpts from the unabridged text, thus allowing for meaningful experiences in critical analysis."
3,AN EASY READ Maybe TOO easy,"I ordered two copies of this book because I thought I would have to sit and read it with my 10 year old. She finished it in less than an hour. Needless to say, I didn't have to read it with her. She wanted more detail, so I am going to buy the Hearney (I think that is how you spell it) translation. I think that will be a better fit."
3,"Short, sweet, but not so to the point","I believe that this book could be classified as one of those stories that you are glad you took the time to read after you finish it, but getting to that final stage of completion is more of a task than it may seem.Surprisingly, this is one of the few short stories (90 some pages) that I have ever read, that seemed to droan on for a good half of the time. Never the less, there were some profound moments in the story in which I felt I had been given some truly great moments in literature. My only qualm was that it needed to be about half (or cut it down by a fair 20 pgs) so the reader would not loose so much interest. Do remember though, it is only 90 pages long, so it is not one of the more monotonous scripts out there."
4,DEZ influenced PRINCE on the bounce rock!,"PRINCE songs like ""Sister"",""Sexuality"",""Delirious"" and ""Horny Toad"" and anything else similar are sounds of DEZ. DEZ didn't write them but the music touched PRINCE,he never had that sound before the DIRTY MIND album. But he did use it when DEZ left to do The MODERNNAIRES for ""Let's Go Crazy"".DEZ is no longer that wild man,Chinese-bandana wearing,axeman. He's still the axeman,but a born-again one. 13 songs,all of them with heartfelt lyrics to make you think like ""Like A Merry Go Round"" he talks about the ups and downs that life brings us. ""Peacehopejoy"" maybe the heaviest song on the CD while most of the disc is mellow but great guitar work.At the end of the album,behind ""Real To Me"" he gives thanks to fans and JESUS CHRIST and asks you to come along. The CD does not bore,musically,lyrically and spiritually. DEZ would tell you,it's just ""The Way I Feel"". DEZ I feel ya!"
1,Why not finally release MODERNAIRE on CD?,"I really wanted to like this CD - and I even bought it at retail to support Dez - but...it's rather unlistenable. Flat. Unmemorable. Rote. Why not just finally release his amazing MODERNAIRE track from Purple Rain? After hearing that song back in '84, I waited patiently for the Dez solo CD...and waited and waited and waited...this ain't it."
4,FANS OF JOEY SANTIAGO,"This is a great album for fans of Joey Santiago and his work with the Pixies. If you love his guitar play, then I would definitely suggest buying this."
4,A useful reference,The strengths of this book are the tips to getting yourself out of trouble. The interesting part of this book are the interviews with the major players in the history of the MAC. Gives a chance to those people to voice their opinion of the state of the MAC.
2,"""Bible"" is apt...","I have to admit, from the outset, that I am not a Mac person. I am a PC tech trying to service one of the only Mac's I will probably work on this year. I have a copy of the Mac Bible. It is huge! That's not bad if it is useful. The problem I am having is finding what I need while I have to wade through the barrels of verbage that are useless to me. I finally had to resort to scouring the Web to find my answers. I guess I'm used to the more direct, almost cookbook approach to troubleshooting and setup. To be fair, and thats why I gave the book two stars instead of one, I realize that the different chapters are written by different authors, so the content and style will vary. Unfortunately for me the sections I needed were written by authors I would rather not consult in the future."
5,A most comprehensive and even funny Mac book,"I taught computer classes at a high school and had every sort of Mac from the SE/30 to IMac in the same room. This book helped me with every computer, with every problem, and stopped many classroom disasters. The format is easy, the index very complete, and you will never need another book for your Mac but this one! The fact that it is concisely and even humorously written is a bonus!"
4,More and more cuteness...,"There's something about the lovely young ladies of Ai Yori Aoshi that tugs at the heart strings. Each has their own distinctive personality; so much so that they are basically graphic representations of literary archetypes themselves.The eighth volume of the series is pretty much more of the same that readers have come to expect of Kaoru's possible love interests. Several stories revolve around Chika-chan's innocent infatuation (and her talent at extremely cute, chibi-plushies) and her eventual move to the mansion. There are also a few chapters dealing with Aoi and Kaoru exclusively. It was especially touching to see him subtly introduce Aoi to his Mother in a scene that has been played out just as well in other grand romantic series (Maison Ikkoku comes to mind).All in all, volume eight pleases in the various aspects it encompasses (cuteness, fanservice, romance, drama, comedy, etc.)."
4,Starring who?,"The blurb up on the initial description has the stars wrong. Josh Duhamel and James Caan? Woops!Fun to watch, the era is attractive."
3,Vegas pilot,"M Chiklas is ok in this,Denis Quaid is ok as well. This is not as good as The Shield though."
2,Not worth your Time,"Poor acting, silly plot, and bad writing! The first one was not so bad...went down hill from there. Not worth your time."
5,I love this show,"I love this show, it looks like it is going to be cancelled, such a waste. If they'd give it time, I think it would grow into a real hit. The story lines are engaging, the acting is wonderful. The premise is unique and interesting. Shows which are different need a time to grow, it is a pity this show will not be given that chance."
4,This is turning out to be a really good show.,"I've been watching this on Amazon Instant video because it's on too late for me...I get up at 5:30 on work days. I wasn't sure I was going to like it at first, but as the relationships developed & Dennis Quaid stopped scowling so much, it's grown on me. The bad guys aren't always so bad & the good guys aren't always so good & everybody is about as un-PC as you can get. It's grown on me and is a great relief from the sanitized view of most TV these days when juvenile sex gags & humiliation pass for comedy and nobody dare offend anyone while offending everyone."
3,ok show,i dont' hate it but it doesn't quite peak my intrest. may end up watching it later if i am bored.
5,Ranchers vs Old Vegas Mob,Great series featuring the beginnings of Las Vegas. Dennis Quaid is delightful as the Sheriff and I gotta love the mobsters too.
5,Capacity is key,These bags can hold so much debris that I still haven't had to replace the original since I bought the vacuum about 5 months ago!
5,I'm a VERY lucky man!!!!,I had this album on vinyl when it was first released in 1982 and regretted the loss of it for years!! I've been searching online for it and could only find it available for $250+!! I finally found someone selling it for a reasonable price and I GOT IT!! This is by far one the most important musical purchases I've made in years. This CD is astounding...Chaka at her best!!
1,Ordered it and sent it right back,"I opened the box, took them out and immediately ran into problems: the attachment to the headset was way too tight and it was impossible to sit them all the way in. This is important because you want them to sit as close to your eyes as possible. After using considerable force, I was able to clip them halfway on....and then it stuck. I didn't even bother buying batteries before sending them back."
5,Underated soul Diva,Barbara Mason is a very underated singer. I never heard of her and purchased this cd by chance it really surprised me that this material wasnt recognized since Im always up on my music. the one song that really stands out is bed and board which is sang with depth. then there is the splendid song with the futures we got each other which really puts you in the mood for some good old soul music.
3,Follow the brick road to commercial abbandon...,"I'm a fledgling Triumvirat fan who was turned on to them through ""Spartacus"". After hearing the useless crys that Triumvirat were ELP clones, I had to get ""Spartacus"" myself. The the Triumvirat seduction was complete. Just the prog I was looking for.Flash forward a couple of weeks to my local indie store and I found ""A La Carte"" assuming that it was in the same prog vein. Oh, how wrong I was. I was ready to snap the disc in half as the feel-good Supertramp meets Elton John assaulted my ears. As I stepped away and came back to it, ""A La Carte"" started to grow. After all, ""Spartacus"" has plent of groovy and catchy moments so this wasn't much of a streatch.Now, after digging it for about a week, ""A La Carte"" it ok by me though it won't be up there with ""Spartacus"" or even ""Pompeii"" it's a good pop-post-prog album in it it's own right."
3,read the description,"I have no issue with the seller, but I did not read clearly. This is ONE 10 pound ankle weight. I could not even lift it out of the box. The sellers were great and gave me a refund upon return."
