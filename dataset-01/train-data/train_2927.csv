1,Disappointed!,This is the only book I have ever returned! I teach and completely not what I expected!!!! I wanted to share with the children truly how the candy cane came about!!! Very disappointed!
3,I wish it were better,"Joel Samberg has done some fine research here, but his writing struck me as being not up to the task at hand. He's fine with his plot descriptions but overly prone to wrapping up each little discussion with a cutesy comment. He also tends to rely way too heavily on the Academy Awards as a barometer of quality, and he sprinkles in all sorts of material that really should be attributed, such as casting gossip and generic remarks about what kind of reviews the movies received. As a reference book, Reel Jewish has value but I can't say I thought the world of it."
3,Yellow? not green ivy?,"The spinkler looks fairly heavy duty.It's winter. I won't be testing it for a bit. But the photo shows a green base. Yes, Ivy is green.What was delivered to me was yellow.I've tried to contact Amazon for a correction and am getting no where.Yellow was not offered as a choice in the ordering process.A truely unpleasant surprise for Christmas. TK - St. Louis"
4,Topical Bible Index,"Great study tool for your Bible Tool Box. Easy to navigate, fun to read. Knowledge is power. Love Kindle reference tools! You can carry 7 books including your two Bibles in one little tablet."
3,It could be a little better,I've used this pole for a few years. It tended to break at the pole joints under side stress when picking it up to place it in the boat. I used some PVC pipe down the center and duct tape to hold the joints together. It looked cheesey but worked.The best features of this product is the mushroom top that helps to spread the weight off a single point and a wide base. There is a small hole in the top of the mushroom into which you can screw a snap. If you have a snap already on the cover this will help keep it where you want it on the cover. The wide base keeps it from moving or falling as you are finishing putting on the cover.This year I took the best of 2 worlds and got an aluminum adjustable height pole and fitted the mushroom top and base to it. This is a little more expensive but worth the cost in aggravation.
3,Does the job - adequate,This is plastic and I was expecting metal. It is adequate for the job and not a bad value for the price.
2,Soft toilet seat,"Do not like this product very much. The embroidered picture is very nice but the seat itself is not very soft or comfortable. When you sit on it it wrinkles and takes a while to get the smoothness back. For the money I paid, I expected more padding in this seat. I would not recommend this product."
4,They're forming in a straight line.,"Several punk bands have covered a Ramones album in it's entirety. Screaching Weasel were the first band to do it, recording this cover version of the Ramonesfirst albumin one 14 hour session in October of 1992. The band sticks closely to the original arrangements of the songs, but they play them faster. Some people might criticize them for not changing things up a little, but it works for me. The CD adds four bonus tracks recorded in June 1996, which were originally released as the Formula 27 EP. This is a fun punk album."
5,excellent,"I love the game especially when boxing Mike Tyson,I was happy to buy this game and it reminded me when I was in seventh grade and I now found it and enjoy playing video games."
5,Great Retro Game,We've been looking for this retro classic for awhile and it was definately worth ordering it!
3,Great,This game came just as it was advertised and worked perfectly. My husband loves it. I would recommend this to anyone.
5,YOU DON'T GET TO BE MIKE TYSON!,"This game is kinda cheesy but for NES it's one of the best. The first thing is you start out as some little guy that doesn't have a special move. The other boxers on the game all have a special move and all you get is a big right hook. This IS a game you can play millions of times and you eventually end up memorizing the other boxers' weaknesses and get to fight ""Iron"" Mike Tyson himself! This is a Nintendo Classic."
4,Back into a groove!,"This album is well worth the wait, Fish fans! Fish has provided us, once again, with great tunes, destined to become anthems to his cadre of eager fans! This album is worth purchasing alone for the phenomenal ""Brother 52"", and if you are lucky enough to get the CD enhanced version, a video clip of ""Brother 52"" is inserted as well. ""Tara"" is a sweet song, written for his daughter, and tugs at the heartstrings of all parents. Another wonderful choice is ""What Colour is God"", which will be a treat to see live. This album is getting Fish back to basics that we all know and love him for!"
2,discontinued,"This would be a nice addition to a kitchen except for the fact it has been discontinued and no one seems to make the filters for it anymore. So in 3-4 months when the filter no longer works, you'll be left with just the sprayer. It does hook up to the old sprayer hose easily though."
5,Nokia CA-53 Cable,Product just as advertised. Quick service from vendor. Cable works great. Will do business with them again.
2,Big disappointment,"I have a copy Macromedia Director 8 Bible from the same authors, and thought I might learn new Director capabilities like Flash Componets, 3D Lingo, and Javascript syntax from this new edition. To my great disappointment their treatment of these topics is on the verge of nil. Almost nothing compared to tutorials one can find on the web. Avoid this book if you are looking for information on the new capabilities of Director MX 2004. As a matter of fact, there isn't any single volume that satisfactorily treat all these new stuff. There are some very good books on Director 3D, but none on Flash Components and Javascript syntax. You are still on your own when it comes to these topics. Good luck."
2,Not for 3D graphics,"I rated it 2 stars only because my project is primarily with the Shockwave 3D portion of director. There are lots of wonderful 3D things you can do with Director since it has an excellent cross platform 3D engine (if you can figure out how to use it). However this book won't help you to do that. Since Director itself does not document this or provide tutorials, you have to seek this information out on your own."
3,Almost good,This book is good...but i would really like it it has a little more picture on the steps.
5,The Best Flora Purim Album Ever Made!,"I wish I could give this CD collection TEN stars. ""Stories To Tell"" is my favorite Flora Purim album, by far. Many claim ""Butterfly Dreams"" is her best but my favorite is ""Stories To Tell"". Flora was at the top of her career when this album was made and her work is simply outstanding....OUTSTANDING!! The cast of musicians on this CD will startle you. Absolutely the best Latin jazz musicians in the world played with her. I will leave you guessing as to who they are. (OK, just one hint, Carlos Santana does some of his best work ever on ""Silver Sword"".)If you buy just one Flora Purim CD, this MUST be it. I repeat: THIS IS THE BEST FLORA ALBUM EVER MADE (in my humble opinion of course)!!!"
2,Same spice aroma in all teabags,Had great expectations from this tea. There're very few products that feature first flush Darjeeling.But you can feel the aroma of Kashmir spicy tea in all kinds of tea included in the sampler.
5,Essential Rachmaninoff at a good price.,"Buy this box set. Biret is great. She plays Rachmaninoff straight up and doesn't taint the compositions with any wild ""interpretations."" And the recording quality is five star, too. I bought this in order to snag some lesser known Rachmaninoff that I loved (Cinq Morceaux, Moments Musicaux, etc.) and I really got what I paid for. Take a look at the huge tracklist - this is the Rachmaninoff you've been missing out on."
4,What a voice!,Hard to imagine that this beautiful voice belongs to a twelve year old child! She has great depth and feeling - a magical CD.
4,a great 88th Division memoir of WW2,"This book is often overlooked as being ""just a travel book."" In fact it is a fine WW2 memoir (if you read past the first few chapters, of a soldier int he 88th Division in Italy. Quite well done, andrecommended for those looking for information on the war in Italy."
5,Good Resource.,"The Rand McNally ATLAS OF WORLD GEOGRAPHY includes an introduction about how to use the atlas; over ten pages of questions and answers about each of the 7 continents of the world; a section about the universe and solar system; more than 35 different tables and charts outlining islands, mountains, volcanoes, earthquakes, oceans, lakes, rivers, climate and weather patterns, and population; a section that includes all the flags of the world's countries, and slightly more than 110 pages of maps. The book is a fairly inexpensive and makes a great resource, especially in a classroom setting. It really comes in handy if one doesn't have internet access and is writing a report about culture or geography; it makes a great starting point. Its also a great book to study when cramming for JEOPARDY!"
3,"Good, but by no means great.",The Golden Darjeeling I bought before was better in terms of both aroma and aftertaste.
4,Funky Prog Rock Revisited,"It has come back with vengence in the form of Dreadnaught. With great guitar and bass lines that make you want to move. Every time I put this album on, I hear new things. I have seen them perform live and the album shows no shame. If you want to hear something new and funky- check this album out. They definitely give props to every music form. Good job guys!"
3,Paid way too much!,"Quality ok, not clingy, lace not itchy, but would expect to find same nightgown in discount store at half the price."
1,This camera stinks,"I bought this camera and it broke 3 weeks later. I'm so glad I spent 6 bucks on the warranty and got my money back. Now i'll go out and buy a real camera. I was living in the dark ages and never bought a digital camera. I broke down on the morning that I was leaving for a weekend trip and headed around the corner to Radio Shack to zip in and oout with a new camera. This one SEEMED like it was exactly what I needed so I was satisfied at first. In and out in 10 minuted. I took it with me and was disgusted. Focus is terrible. God forbid you want to take an action picture or a picture with low light. All you'll get is a blurry, grainy mess. Anyway, one day I simply hit the power button to turn the camera off, and it completely froze, for good. Nothing. Took it back to Radio Shack, got my money back, and I'm gonna buy someting that's actually worth $300. Well, at least I got to use a camera that weekend for free. Don't buy this camera."
5,GREAT CAMERA LOUSY SUPPORT,"CASIO IS EXTREMELY HESITANT TO PROVIDE WARRANTY SERVICE. CAMERA WAS MAILED IN OCT 25 FOR WARRANTY SERVICE. PLAYED TELEPHONE TAG WITH SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOR 8 WEEKS AND FINALY GOT WORD THAT CAMERA WAS ACCCEPTED FOR WARRANTY SERVICE AND WAS BEING TURNED OVER TO MAINTENANCE AND I ""SHOULD"" RECEIVE CAMERA IN APPROX TEN DAYS. THE KEY WORD BEING ""SHOULD"". I AM NOT GETTING ALL EXCITED JUST YET. . AS MUCH AS I LIKE THE CAMERA I DEFINTELY WOULD NOT BUY ANOTHER CASIO JUST BECAUSE OF THE BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE ASPECT."
2,Very Poor Picture quality going to return,"Today I bought this camera (z50) from compusa and going to return it tomorrow, I have Sony 1.1 MP but still it gives good pic quality compare to Casio z50 5.0 MP. I am completely unhappy with this camera,I don't know why they have made such camera, It seems QC dept forgot to test in low light (evening, night) mode, The LCD diplay is very noisy in low light mode.If you buy this camera you must compare pic quality with Sony Cyber shot or Kodak easy share."
3,Felt Cheated,"I have all of O'Donnell's books. Many I have read several times. Cobra Trap did not live up to the usual action line of his previous books. I even thought there might be another author writing the story?O'Donnell developed so many great endings, each story was easly visualized and enjoyed. Cobra Trap was a fair story, it's just I felt cheated. I knew an ending had to happen, just not that way."
2,Bad Surprise,"'Cobra Trap' is a collection of stories about Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin. All the stories except the last one, 'Cobra Trap' flesh out stories Peter O'Donnell first created as comic strips. I've read some of the graphic novels, one in fact has the story, 'The Bellman'. This story is more fleshed out in greater detail in this book. These stories are a good read and a good peek into the lives of Modesty and Willie. The Last Story, 'Cobra Trap', I warn you not to read if you like your favorite characters to live happily ever after. In fact I try to forget I've read it by re-reading their adventures over again. It was very well written, but shocking and much too sad. If Mr. O'Donnell had left that story off when he wrote the book, it would have been a very good collection of stories."
5,subtheme here,"This movie is brutal, and personally I found nothing comedic about it. Since the plot has been described elsewhere, I won't repeat it; but underlying the plot is a statement about the status of women across cultures. The family life of 2 women are compared, one from an almost medieval Islamic culture, and the other from a modern Western culture (France, probably the most 'liberal' of Western cultures). The message here is that neither culture is much better than the other in its treatment of women. The treatment is different, but one is not better than the other. Throughout the movie, we see Western women lied to, taken for granted, belittled, ignored-- in fact, the movie's final conclusion seems to be this: all over the world, men just suck."
4,Refreshing and empowering movie,"Although there are some stereotypes and few surprises, the movie was a delight to watch. We can identify with each character - their strengths and weaknesses -, both males and females, and watch them grow throughout the movie.Highly enjoyable with the appropriate mix of drama and lightness here and there."
5,A Loving Tribute,"A nostalgic look at 30 years of the modern Monopoly. Yes, it's been thirty years since this game hit the streets. As movie actor Vin Diesel says in the introduction to this book: ""We were all drawn to the bame because it allowed us to become these characters, vastly different in appearance and in actions, but what kept us hooked was the search for the character that represneted our higher self. Playing D&D; was a training ground for our imaginations and an opportunity to explore our own identities.""This book is not on playing the game, it's not exactly a history, it's just a look back. There are parts and articles by Gary Gygax, creator of the game, by various people who have been involved with the game, there are photographs of people, events, bits of the game and more."
1,Save your money.,"This book is low on content and high on typos and other errors. It looks like it wasn't even proof read before it went to the publisher. It's filled with typos and grammatical mistakes. As far as content three of the chapters are actually interesting. I especially enjoyed the history of the Forgotten Realms. For the most part though this book is atrocious. The bit by Gary Gygax, creator of the game, was written six years ago. I would think for a tribute they could have at least tried to obtain some new content. To sum it up this book is nearly as good as the D&D movie (i.e. Terrible.)"
3,What did you expect,"I read a lot of negative reviews of the book before I purchased it and I was almost scared off.The book was exactly what is was supposed to be: a trip down memory lane for a long time player of dnd.Coffee table books, such as this one, are not meant for a rabid cover to cover reading.I loved seeing the pictures of/from old adventures, the history of dnd, and seeing famous people who play(ed).Admittingly, it was a bit costly, but I defrayed that cost by buying from Amazon, so I still think it was worth the money."
4,I'm very happy of my purchase.,"The book is very interesting, the shipment was quick but I had to pay 5,50 to Poste Italiane when I recieved the book."
1,Info and picture not same thing for this item. Hard to order.,Hope I get the right item. I followed links to seashell padded vinyl toilet seat lid. Prouduct picture is of Humming birds??
2,"Great View, but bad support","I was headed to Fry's to buy a different monitor when I saw this one and loved it. Great color, brilliant picture and a fast response time and not much more money. Unfortunately Fry's was out of stock, in fact all of CA Frys were out of stock. So I go online and order it and it arrives about 5 days later. Plug it in and thats when I realize its not as great as I saw in the store. First I upgrade new drivers for my top of the line video card and the monitor itself. But I soon come to realize it takes over 30 min sometimes over an hour for the monitor to finish warming up. During that time it flickers, shakes, and has lines running through it.I also have a bright dead pixel in the middle of the monitor. NEC won't exchange it unless it has 4-5 dead pixels so it looks like I am stuck with a monitor that takes an hour to warm-up and has a dead pixel, pretty sad for almost $600"
5,NEC 1970GX,"Great monitor!! Beautiful text and color...you won't be disappointed if looking for that PERFECT 19 inch LCD display monitor.I liked this over the Sony SDMhs95p because the image was much clearer. Also the NEC has a height and pivot ability to which the Sony does not. And, the Sony has a poor ""picture stand"" that is both unstable and not durable enough for myself or for children's usage.I prefer to buy from a box store just to make sure there are no pixel problems. This monitor had no broken pixels...beautiful color in every way.I checked out Viewsonic, Samsung, Sony and NEC. NEC wins by far!Thanks NEC for finally meeting MY expectations in a clear, easy to read monitor."
3,"Handy for Pilots when a passenger asks, ""Where Are We""?","This is basically a small (8 1/2 x 11) Rand McNally road atlas that has airways and VORs and some airports printed over the road maps in black line art. I am a corporate pilot and use the Jet Route version. I really like having it in the cockpit. It is very handy when a passenger comes up and asks ""Where are we?"", or when they ask the name of some geographical feature. The VOR's have frequencies next to them, but due to the age of the data (1994) many are no longer current. It would be nice if the publisher updated the airway/navaid info. It provides the usual road map information for travel after landing, but the maps are not very detailed due to the small scale. It works okay for major highways and has a selection of major city street maps in the back. I would rate it higher if it were updated."
1,Disappointed,"No offense to the author, but I was a little disappointed with this book because it seems like basically she is just telling the same story about Abraham and his descendants that you can read in the bible."
5,Believe me! it's a great book,this 's a good biography of Anne. it's very interesting book so i can't turn my eyes of it..
5,Worth the Price,"This is probably the most comprehensive book on Blunt Force Trauma on the market. This book is not for beginners or for forensic hobbyists. But for all forensic anthropology/osteology academics out there, it is worth the price."
1,Sad Disappointment,"Moo 2 was such a well done game, when this initally came out my buddies and I were extremely excited. I expected Moo 2 with my playable races better AI perhaps unique tech tree and overall better graphics. I was sadly disappointed, the graphics was the only thing going for this game the rest was a totally and utter failure.They completely changed the dynamics of the game and ruined everything about it, MOO 2 is one of my all time favorites though after this title Masters of Orion will never have the same aura. The developer truly ruined one of the best strategy games ever made."
1,So sad,"I waited so long for this game. I played MOO2 for so many hours, the thought of sequel had me beyond excited. But, this game is horrible . It's not fun.The interface is impenetrable and the game-play is boring. Avoid this game at any price."
2,Master Of Orion 3....too technical to enjoy.,"Master Of Orion 1 and 2 are both very good, but 3 became too involed with advancing technical studies. Also, visiting other planets were mapped out for you; little creative thinking involved. I meant to buy Imperium Galactica 2, which, when I bought that, I enjopyed very much. Maybe you will enjoy MOO 3 more that I did."
4,"Compelling, both in plot and style","Two stories unfold in parallel, but, as we proceed, become more closely entwined. London investigator Saz Martin is hired to find mystery woman ""Septemeber."" Hired by a man with whom the woman has dinner ever other Friday nite, but, who doesn't even know her name. Meanwhile, comic Maggie has rocky relationship with ""the girl with the Kelly McGillis body"", who harbors some mysteries of her own. The writing is very stylish, funny, wry, ironic, perceptive, surprisingly profound. In another forum, I compared it to Raymond Chandler, but updated and with no y chromosome. It's style works very well; it suits both the characters and the story. The characters are likeable, though they don't always do the things we'd like them to; in other words, they'll a little like all of us. If you like Katherine Forrest or Claire McNab, say, then this may not be your cup of tea. Try it anyway, though; you might just be pleasantly surprised."
1,"defective parts, assembly difficult","I ordered this based on reviews, some of which said it was easy to put together. However, the holes in the rods do not fit well with the other parts that go in and some rods do not have holes at the specified spots to put the screws in. If you are trying to assemble this with a new baby, it is a nightmare. Will be returning it."
1,Deluxe? I think not.,"So we bought this after having purchased similar organizers from retai stores in the past.It was shipped to us and packaged great. The product it self is junk. Half of the screws would not thread into their intended holes and the threads had to be retapped. One of the holes where you insert the wheels will not hold the wheel so it keeps falling off. The center piece of the top separator was not sewn on one end. I think this would be a good product if it didn't have so many manufacturing defects. I would not recommend this to anyone, you're better off looking at other products."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS !!,"Do not buy this cart !This is such a waste of money.It's not sturdy at all, made out of some cheap material !I do not recommend this cart at all !!"
4,Very useful!,"This is very useful for me as I place it next to the play yard which has a changing table on it. Even though I am not using the changing table from the play yard, it is good for me to put the diapers and all the bath stuff. One though though, it is shaky and the whole thing don't feel very stable."
3,dissapointed,"I ordered this item because the reviews were good and I needed something small. When I recieved it I was really excited and immediately wanted to put it together so I could start organizing my baby stuff. To my surprise, the screws wouldn't fit in the holes. I must of got a defective item, but they should really make sure the screws fit through the holes before sending it. I was really disappointed so I returned it to Target and bought the munchkin closet organizer. I'm really happy with it."
5,Great product and can be used for other things for years,"I loved this for when my son was sleeping in our room. I didn't have to go back and forth to his room in the middle of the night.We are now using it for my daughters dress up items, shoes on bottom, dress in the middle, hats and accessories on top."
3,OKAY but not great!,"This cart is just okay. It definitely does the job of neatly storing many baby items however, just as other reviewers have mentioned, this cart has its flaws. First - it takes a little while to put together. Then, the cardboard pieces that are provided to place in 4 of the pockets are just thin pieces of cardboard. i still feel it does its job and looks quite nice in my nursery."
2,"4 CHEAP CARDBOARD INSERTS TO LINE BOTTOM OF ""6"" SECTION FABRIC CART","The frame is sturdy enough. The material of the cart is similar to parachute fabric, so that's sturdy, but this company includes 4 flimsy cardboard type inserts to line some of the bottom sections. They should have been hard plastic inserts. That would have made the bottom of each section more stable for holding baby oil, powder, and lotions, etc..Removable plastic inserts could also be wiped clean. That would have been more sanitary than this cardboard.It's disgusting when these manufacturers have a good idea and then decide to go cheap. Charge a few bucks more and make the product good and durable. What's so difficult about that? Don't these manufacturers want more than a one time customer? I wouldn't buy from them again. As a matter of fact, I would discourage my friends from purchasing this product."
5,I love love it,"I love this product.....I am on a budget with this baby and needed something to orginize the nursery and baby clothing. Despite the reviews when I ordered this product, I bought it anayways. I know how picky people can be!!!. I hate to put things together and I did put this together prefectly in about 20-30 mins and it is sturdy for me!!!I would Buy again!!!!Mommyof3iniowa"
1,Very flimsy and hard to put together,"I had another model of this same product for my first child and it worked okay, so I got another one for my upcoming second child. This one is VERY difficult to put together and the screw don't work well with the metal frame. Once together it is very flimsy and doesn't seem like it will hold up very long at all. Don't waste your money. Look for a more solid organizer."
4,love it,"i absolutely love this. It organizes his clothes well and now i use it for my mom's room. My son stays in my mom's room during the day, when my husband and i are at work. Its really convenient coz i just fill it up with supplies she needs for the whole week right after we sort out laundry. The only set back is the wheels..it always comes out and is not as sturdy as you would want it...but otherwise does the job well.."
1,disappointing,"I specially ordered this book and was very disappointed. The writing is very dry, the characters not at all fleshed out, the details missing. It doesn't come alive like other historical novels I've read."
3,Halloween collectible decorations,Nice selection and photos of old Halloween decorations but would be more interesting if the items were dated rather than a collectors current price.
3,Great for those who are interested in Oliver history.,"This book is a complete history of the Oliver tractor. It starts with Hart-Parr and goes through AGCO/White. There are lots of pictures and original advertisements. The book would have been a lot more useful if some of the pictures had been in color. I would have rated it a 4 or 5 maybe if there were color pictures. All-in-all, I found this to be a very interesting book."
4,Excellent!,"This was a great album with great songs such as ""Through it all"" and ""Do me right"". I let a friend hear it back in the 80's and they loved it but couldn't find the album anywhere! I am glad I finally found it again online."
2,"Bland, unimaginative twist on Zeppelin","I bought this album in hopes of finger-blistering flamenco and fluid acoustic renditions of my favorites. Instead, i received a CD with the most straight-forward, carbon-copy of the originals. Each song is almost exactly note-for-note. DeVinck takes the stength out of each track with dulled versions of Page's original riffs and solos. I was not expecting a masterpiece or top-notch classical guitar when I bought this album, however, i expected a little more talent and creativity to be displayed (like the string quartet tributes 1 & 2). Anyways, i say pass on this one, but you might like it... if you like elevator music."
1,A Tedious Sequel,"I didn't like one single thing about this movie. I really liked the original. Even the idiotic Exorcist II is better than this bomb. The dialogue was forced and very boring. The characters were underdeveloped and completely uninteresting. George C Scott spent a lot of time yelling but it came off as pointless noise. The ""light hearted banter"" between Scott and his priest friend in the hospital seemed like it was written by a junior-high school student. The plot was pathetic and the whole thing wasn't the least bit scary or even remotely entertaining. This had absolutely none of the ambience or creepiness of the original. The big exorcist scene at the end was so unimaginative, tired and stiff. I would never recommend this loser to anyone. I had a hard time believing that William Peter Blatty had ANYTHING to do with this, it was so poor. The only thing even close to interesting in here were the scenes with Brad Dourif."
3,The Exorcist 3,I think this film is better when not compared to the Exorcist. This movie is along the same lines as that classic. The plot involves Dective Kinderman and Father Dyer 15 years after the origanal. Brutal killings start popping up int the style of a killer that was put to death the night of the first exorcist. Jason Miller returns to the fold as Patient X.The movies is intresting and more in the tone of the first film.
4,Flawed yet fascinating continuation of the Exorcist story.,"Exorcist writer William Peter Blatty adapted his novel Legion, an honest attempt to further study the nature of faith as well as good and evil, and, thankfully, he managed to capture some of the novel's powerful concept. There is also several good seat jumping moments sprinkled throughout what is essentially a character driven story. Until the end, when the special effect exorcism takes over. That part isn't in the book, if I'm recalling it correctly, and it cheapens the over all feel of the movie. Nonetheless, this is an intelligent thriller that wants to do more than just shock and scare you. Highly recommended."
3,"Sensationalism, suspenseful, but still.....","The movie is almost unrecognizable from the book. It was made to draw a blood-thirsty audience, but what's missing is what is so difficult to portray on the screen: Kinderman's philosophy. After heading the homicide department for so long, he still maintains his belief in things good and beautiful, in spite of the horrible killings happening in Georgetown.The movie (as well as the book) disagree in places with the original ""Exorcist"", but because of the storyline, it can be forgiven. Although in the first movie, Damien Karras and Kinderman never had the chance to really get to know each other, ""Exorcist III"" claims that they were the best of friends.I think the casting was great. If Lee J. Cobb couldn't do this film, then George C. Scott would do just fine. The brief appearances by Jason Miller were great, and added to the especially frightening parts of this movie.I still say the book is much better, though."
2,Too slow pace for my liking,"Strange as it is,most of the time any movie that have the Part 2,3,etc.... are normally a disappointment and EXORCIST 3 is one of them.It has it's moment and a good story line but it's just too slow pace for my liking.Music scoring is not intense and most of the time it's talking talking and more talking.Horror movie making sure have come a long way comparing what's available now.In my opinion EXORCIST 1 is still the BEST !"
3,Exorcist 3...Overrated,"I saw part 1....part 2 and then part 3....Obviously part 1 was the best.....Honestly part 3 was so boring...There were barely any horror scenes...Just mostly talk, conversation and arguing between the old lieutenant, the priest and the gemini killer... I mean even part 2 had more graphics and scenes than part 3....."
1,Why did they even waste their time?,"This movie is absolutely NOTHING compared to the original! I think its an insult to the first one for the people to have even considered making this movie. They could have saved a lot of money,time,energy and humiliation by just not making this movie!"
2,THE HERETIC IS WAY BETTER THAN THIS!,OH MY GOD THIS FILM WAS AWFUL. IT REMINDED ME OF A LONG X-FILES EPSIODE. THE SCREENPLAY WAS HORRIBLE. ESPECIALLY THE PART WHERE LT. KINDERMAN IS TELLING DYER ABOUT THE FISH IN THE BATHTUB. THE MOVIE WAS GOOD AL THE WAY UNTIL AFTER THE JESUS STATUE OPENED ITS EYES. AFTER THAT DOWNHILL. BORING! THE HERETIC WAS 10 TIMES BETTER THAN THIS FILM. THE HERETIC IS THE MOST UNDERATED FILM OF ALL TIME. THE ONLY REASON PEOPLE LIKED THIS ONE WAS BECAUSE IT TRIED TO SCARE YOU. THE HERETIC WAS MUCH MORE INTELIGENT. SO ANYWAYS THE FILM SUCKED THE BIG ONE. EXORCIST 1 AND 2 ARE THE BEST. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP!
2,Even worse than Exorcist II,"Although this third sequel had a few return characters, unlike the second sequel, it was as confusing as number 2.Even George C. Scott couldn't save this film.There was no ending, no closure.I wouldn't buy it or even accept it as a gift.Stick with The Exorcist original and leave it at that."
3,This film reinstalls the darkness that part two destroyed.,"Exorcist 3, the only TRUE sequel to the Exorcist (as authorized by William Peter Blatty), continues the story with a most interesting plot and a very frighteneing new character, who assumes a very ""familiar"" face.Lt. Kinderman returns( originally played by Lee J. Cobb now George C.Scott)and is faced with more supernatural crimes in the heart of Georgetown.Personally, I prefer returning characters to be portrayed by the original actors, but hey, you can't blame Mr. Cobb for being dead!The book on which the film is based ( entitled ""LEGION"") is great, but the film tends to fall short a times...but still, after part two, this one deserves an oscar. If you expect the original, you'll be left unsatisfied, so view it with an open mind and you're bound to enjoy it."
5,William Peter Blatty's genius continuation of true horror,"Exorcist Three, with the amazing cast of George C, Scott and Brad Dourif should be among the greatest of psychological-suspense-horror. If there was anyone else who could play Lieutenant Kinderman, and if there was anyone else who could play the latest incarnation of the demon, I'd like to see it. William Peter Blatty at his best. And that's the truth."
4,great scarry flick,this movie will scare the poop out of you... watch it with the lights on and a copy of the Bible in your hands.
5,Best Exorcist,"This film has great sound, performances, and visuals. You can tell the author, William Peter Blatty, had the control over this one. Very eerie!"
4,Better Story Then The Original,"The first time I saw this was on TV. Needless to say, it was edited for content. Even with it being censored, I was drawn into the story. The best scenes are the interviews between Scott and Dourif. Dourif's performance as the Gemini Killer brings out the same uncomfortable laughter that Jack Nicholson causes in Batman. A great job of writing and directing by William Peter Blatty. I hope the book comes back into press, so I can read it."
4,"On it's own, a very good film","First, do not think that when you buy this you will get simply another 'Exorcist'. It is in a class of its own. This movie draws you into the characters more. Based on the novel 'Legion' by Blatty, it is more subtle than the first. The evil permeates every facet of the film, in nearly every scene it can be felt. Brad Dourif is disturbing, George C. Scott is intense as Kinderman. Reading the novel gives a better understanding of the motivations of the rest of the cast, but even without that, one still gets the odd sensation that maybe not everything is as it appears. I think the best way to describe the movie was that it did not necessarily scare me, but it did disturb me."
3,Gemini Killer + Pazuzu --> Father Karras,"Unlike Exorcist II, this Exorcist III - Legion, seems like a much better sequal to the Exorcist I. In terms of the scary parts, I didn't recall any subliminal shots but there's indeed a couple of ""jump"" moments really got me. There's not many visual scary shocking effects as the first Exorcist, but if you follow the conversation and dialogs well, they do really make you feel scary. Worst part of this dvd is lacking of extra features. It, in fact, only contains the theatrical trailer and closed caption subtitle. Period. If there's director's commentary feature, it will be greatly appreicated. Overall, not bad but Exorcist I is still the best.*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for Exorcist III ***1. Film Rewatchability: LOW2. DVD Featurability: VERY WEAK3. Picture Quality: VERY GOOD4. Sound Quality: VERY GOOD(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 5-Sep-2004)"
2,William Peter Blatty tries again,"I found Exorcist 3 to be better than Exorcist II but not as good as the original Exorcist. Exorcist 3 is somewhat of a continuation of the first film only without the character of Linda Blair and her mother. This movie is a bit of a snoozer in some areas but the end is pretty wicked. I would only recommend watching this if you want to know what happens after the Exorcist or Exorcist II. However, if you haven't seen Exocist II then do yourself a favor and skip on to part 3."
3,"Boring, lacks momentum","Quite disappointed about this sequel. The story and the screenplay both have some ambition, but the whole film lacks momentum. Too many scenes took in the jail chamber, too many ""philosophical"" dialogues. It's a pity to waste the mysterious feeling of the hopistal."
5,Excellent service,Book arrived on time and perfect condition!!!! It's a gift for a friend I know he will appreciate the excellent condition!!
3,Average,I am not sure how the whole program is but on a few the answers seem a bit juvenile but sometimes sitting at a computer flipping through the reviews was easier than reading from a text book. I ended up studying with books I got from the library and only used this product once for 5 mins. Can't say if it helped anymore or less.
3,Was fine,"I didn't like the lack of control i had over the cards, just mixing them and such. Other than that this was an okay product. I did however ended up returning them and buying Barron's ASVAB flash cards. Overall I would not recommend these to anyone."
2,Not very useful,"Didn't find it useful at all. The answers are way too generic and don't match what's on the test. You can't print out cards to carry along and study, you're just stuck with a very primitive user interface. There are no sample tests - I would have preferred something where you're presented with a question, answer it, then have the program explain to you why the answer was wrong. That's not what this does.I found other ASVAB books much more useful."
2,Meh..,"Not much in this. Disjointed, poor dialogue. Not sure exactly what the overarching theme is here, especially with the music."
3,Poor transfer to dvd,"The movie itself is a Jean-Luc's classic so it is recommended for Godard's fans, but beware: the Fox Lorber transfer is very poor. The copy is very dark with burnt out blacks and dim colors. Also the master film copy wasn't the cleanest with visible dust and particles. 5 stars for the movie and 2 stars for the transfer, hence the score of 3.5."
1,suck-ola,too big and awkward for my cats' claws....also not very sharp. :(Would recommend some of the cheap-o pairs I used to own for my guinea pigs claws over these in a heartbeat.
5,"MUST BUY this one! After you read it, you won't let it go.","You'll want to start this project right after you read. This is the same quality as LANDSCAPE QUILTS with Nancy Zieman & co-author- the Best Quilts on earth.Most beautiful reverse applique gated gardens, clear instructions with pictures, and paper TEMPLATES to help you get started. How to arrange colors for a garden, even mountain-scapes and stain-glass like designs included, and you don't have to include the gates if you don't wish to.There are pictures to inspire as well as a couple projects to start with. I am keeping this one next to my bedside!"
5,beautiful,"Great ideas. Beautiful pictures. Even if I never make a thing from this book, I love having it in my collection."
1,Yawn,"Anyone who thought that the character of Hal Jordan was gettingstale need look no further than this book to find out that there areindeed worse things. Hal Jordan's character maintained a loyal fan base for thirty years, but Kyle Rayner's character gets old, stale, and boring after the first panel. Who cares about this Gen X slacker who had a power ring dropped into his lap without doing anything to earn it? I certainly don't."
2,I beat this game in a matter of a few hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I thougt there would be a better story line, and what I found was very disappointing.The boss (McGruder) was easier to beat than the boss in the Matrix-Path to neo. I mean, I paid good money for this game on the premise that it was a quality game; obviously I was wrong."
1,It's a Third Person Shooter folks....,Not a First Person Shooter. This fact is not mentioned anywhere.A big disappointment....
1,Gun,I did not get a chance to play game. It had a virus on the #1 disc and I returned it. Am awaiting a replacement game.
1,AAAARGGH!,"It's dreadful. Dreadful! ""Epic storyline"" is so boringly confusing I didn't get further than the first mission. It was too hard. How am I supposed to shoot twenty people with something that can't aim. And why are we obsessed with guns. Oh my, it's got a bullet that can kill someone."
3,Short & Sweet,"I bought this game knowing it was a short game but worth a play from what everyone has told me ... & it was exactly that.Graphics were good for it's time, not way too fancy but its good enough & the environments were very well done.The gameplay wasn't too complicated from what I can remember. The targeting could have been better but wasn't bad at all.The ""quests/objectives"" seemed redundant after a while but still wasn't too bad either. To be honest if they'd have added a bit more variety & made the length of the game longer it would have definitely garnered a higher score!If you are looking for a cheap game that won't dissapoint for the price this isn't a bad game ... but I wouldn't spend more then maybe 15 bucks on it nowadays."
3,Lots of fun when you work around the flaws,"Let's get the flaws out of the way: your video hardware may not be supported and if it is than make sure you have the latest drivers; GUN feels like it was ported from a console to the PC (the game play is scripted); and GUN doesn't support all of the modern sound cards, so I had to turn my audio hardware acceleration to Basic to prevent game crashes. On to the good -- it's a blast toting a six-gun, acting as a marshal, and generally experiencing the Western Myth. The quick draw mode is intuitive, and the variety of weapons provides enough tactical challenge to keep me interested. I definitely got my money's worth!"
3,Bad Ending,"I thought the game was fun and challenging. i did not like the ending. what was with the wolf? i liked the gold mining option, wish there would have been more gold. i did expierence the slow down when there are more than 4-5 enemy gunman on screen. all in all it was an ok game."
2,Not much good to say,"Overall I loved the setting. I wish more companies would try themes other than the standard fantasy and science fiction. If they had developed the game into a full, open world rpg it could have been really fun. As is, it is a mixed bag, o.k. for a diversion but not worth spending a lot of money on."
1,Lame,"Hello! This is the lamest pregnancy journal ever. I was nervous about buying one online, where its basically sight unseens, and this book confirmed my fears. The other negative reviews basically cover it, but needless to say, I won't be using this. It tries to be warm and cuddly & day-plannery all at the same time, and they fail. My suggestion - get an empty journal for your thoughts, and get the Practical Pregnancy Planner for everything else."
2,The Great Count Down,"I'm just starting out, and VERY excited! After looking through this book it has some very helpful information, but I'm disappointed in one MAJOR issue. I just bought this book today, and I'm due in March of 2010, the problem is that there is no calendar that goes up to 2010. They have placed a cheep loose leaf page in the front of the journal, but it only goes up to '09. So if like me you're looking forward to the week by week (calendar) countdown look somewhere else."
4,Just what I wanted,"I used this same planner for my pregnancy last time, and just bought a second one for this time around. It works great for me. It is small enough that I can carry it around with me easily, it has a lot of space for notes for each week (unlike many which have a large space for weekly pictures and just a small spot for notes), and has the same categories week after week, so you can really see how thing progress as the pregnancy advances.I don't look to a pregnancy planner for pregnancy, delivery, or parenting advice, I just want it to act as a pregnancy journal, and medical record keeper, etc. so I don't have much to comment on re: the actual information in the book. It has some, I just have never paid it any attention. I just like the format, the size, the layout, etc."
1,Guggul from India,"Well I got this at a good price and when it came in the mail and I opened it the bottle was expired. Great, if I would of known it was coming from India I would not of purchased it."
1,Don't do it!,Really awful - don't waste your money. (One star is the least the system will let me give).
3,Disapointment,"I was most disappointed in the 2-Alarm Kit I bought yesterday (January 29, 2011). I had bought it many times over the last several years but found that today's bowl of chili didn't taste as it used to. It was rather 'bla' and is missing a distinct chili taste. I was also disappointed with the coupon for $10,000 give-away vacation trip that closed nearly a month ago!"
1,Used to be good ... not any more.,"Wick Fowler's Chili used to be my hands down favorite, but the last three times (third time was the fortunate last time) it was clear the recipe or ingredient quality had changed. The recipe now seems to have to come off much darker and grainer and the flavor is thick and unpleasant. I will not be purchasing Wick Fowler's Chili ever again - I'm sure I can do better with a made from scratch effort which will not take any significant increase in time, but a more sampling."
1,Not Much Taste,picante but not with enough flavor. I would say hot and bland. I can do much better with my own spices.
1,over priced store.....,I really like the chili kit - buying it for years - and still doseems to me this place is very over priced - unless it's just notfor sale in your area.
1,If I could rate it 0 I would,"Not so good. This doesn't taste like chili. The other folks in the house ate it and enjoyed, but I literally could not eat it. There was something ""funky"" with the spice mix. I think it may have been the flour or the fake onions. Not worth any price."
5,Yummy Yummy Yummy,"I am a native Texan and I've had so many different chili's I can't even remember how many. This is the BEST EVER! We sadly moved from Texas to Seattle 6 years ago and I tried many times to make chili this good myself since I couldn't find a store up here that sells Wick Fowler's. So, YAY for Amazon! I bought some before Christmas (bought during a trip to New Orleans) and my family was in heaven again tasting the awesome flavors of Wick Fowler's 2 alarm chili. I used up the last of my supply for the Christmas party chili - even my native northwestern neighbors loved it. I was so happy to find some on Amazon, now we will be enjoying great chili again without traveling all the way back to Texas."
5,Couldn't find this ANYWHERE,I had used this product for years......then I couldn't find it at any of the stores where I shopped for groceries. I was delighted to be able to get it at Amazon. It is a wonderful chili mix.
5,GREAT chili :),I have used this chili mix since I was in Austin Texas. It is the best mix a person can get. Makes awesome chili and is very easy :) Now that I'm in West Virginia I have to buy this online instead of the grocery store.. I'm just glad I can still buy it :D
4,Hot chili,"This stuff makes the perfect hot (as in spicy) chili. Follow the directions (use ""chili grind"" beef from a butcher), and you can't miss."
3,"Good for approaching transition, not judging suitability","I purchased this book in order to find out what developmental milestones a child should achieve before graduating from one daycare room to another. This book had a chapter specifically focused on transitioning from the baby room to the toddler room. I have a special needs child, but wanted to know what the standards were. This book is about preparing for the transition. It does not cover when the transition is appropriate."
4,Read before calling your Pediatrician,This book is a lifesaver! It answers so many common questions that new parents have. As well as saves time in determining whether to call your pediatrician or not. I usually give this as a baby shower gift because it is a MUST HAVE in every baby library!
5,HARD,Uhhhhhhhh....... HARD!!!! this game is insanely hard but I reccomend it to everyone that likes a challenge. I can barely get to the 3rd level but its pretty fun there are so many secret areas it always keeps the game new and fresh it never becomes old and repetitive it is probably one of the most hardcore games on the NES so you have to get this game if you dont already have it
4,Excellent....... Make sure you know what your buying!,"The Wii Sports pack does not include the Wii sports game that comes with the Wii system. It is three attatchments for the wii controller. One is the golf club, one is the tennis racket, and one is the baseball bat. These three attachments make playing the game more real because your acually swinging the baseball bat or golf club. At first these attchments will be hard to put on/off, but after a few uses it becomes very easy to detach/attach them. These attachments are not neccesary for playing the game, I reccomend buying these if you have a few extra dollars. Don't pay too much, If you wait till December you can usually get them for between $11-$15."
1,product listed wrongly,"The game is fun but, when I purchased this product it was listed as a game.... It is not its the assoc. that go with the game, then when I returned it I was charged for shipping even though this was not MY mistake, its listed wrong, and I probably won't buy from Amazon again...Very upset about this...."
1,Still haven't received the right product,"I wouldn't know how this product is. I ordered the 2 liter carafe and was sent a 1.5 liter carafe instead. Contacted customer service who assured me they would send out the 2 liter one. Got another 1.5 liter one today! Does the 2 liter carafe exist, and if so, why can't I get it?"
2,Less Than Average Performance,"The carafe kept the coffee warm. Preheating did not seem to increase its performance. I have had the carafe about six-months, now the coffee dribbles out the pour spout taking a good while to fill up a mug. I have looked and probed for material build-up in the pour spout and cap but have not found anything of note. Looks like I am in the market, again, for another carafe. My suggestion to you it to look at other products."
4,Coffee carafe,"Lives up to most of the claims. It does hold a full pot of coffee, keeps it hot for several hours. Because the temperature probe is shorter than the line the pot of coffee reaches, the accuracy of it is not great."
3,Holds a lot but doesn't keep it particularly hot,"This holds a full pot of coffee, but doesn't keep it nearly as hot as the smaller carafe I own. Good for a few hours, but beyond that, you'll need to heat the contents again."
3,Kept it HOT but the red button broke...,Had it less than a year and worked fine but the button for pouring just stopped working broke somehow!!! Trying to get a replacement from the manufacturer. Keeping fingers crossed as I paid the $40+ for it and had it less than a year.
1,Cold Coffee,I purchased this coffee carafe from a local store. It keeps coffee hot for about 2 hours then cools down fast. I will be taking it back to the store. Thought the theometer might be off but coffee is luke warm after 2 hours so the theometer is correct.
1,Smelly and useless,"I purchased this carafe on Amazon's Habit site. It had an odd smell inside prior to use, so I cleaned it throughout and filled with hot water to warm it while a pot of coffee brewed. When I opened it to empty the water out, the smell was still there so I washed again and let it air dry for a day. Next try, same thing, but I was thinking I was just being picky, so in the coffee went. Yes, the carafe 'flavored' my coffee.At this point it was too late to return, so I left baking soda in it to deodorize it and tried again. I took the top apart and washed every nook and cranny. Long story short, the smell doesn't matter because the carafe will not keep anything hot longer than an hour."
3,KINDA ANNOYING....,I remembered watching this as a child and I love animated shows and movies. I am a kid at heart but I really could not handle this one. I love Halloween and I thought this would be a good one to watch with my one year old but nah!I could only stand to watch about 10 minutes of it. It was kinda annoying. I love monsters and stuff so I thought I would love it. I mean it's okay but I only give it a three star!!!
4,Oldies but goodies!,My husband use to watch this when he was little... I surprised him with it and he just loved it. Now he will be able to share it with our daughter.
3,Bit smaller than 1:55,"I bought this pack only for the king (kid already has lots of mcqueens).Just be warned that these cars are a bit smaller than the 1:55.Product description doesn't specify the correct scale.BTW, my 3 yo kid loved it.I think he still didn't realize or maybe he doesn't care about the fact that the king is smaller than others from his collection."
1,not worth purchasing - it is stupid,I guess that I was the only idiot to purchase this video. THe title sounds really interesting but the video and the title do not coincide. So don't buy it.
1,Junk.,I bought a spider e99 for 80$ and it said the condition was good with only a couple small scratches well all the paint was flaking off and the whole thing was rusted I probably put 100$ into it and it still sosnt work DO NOT ORDER any used paintball gun here you can never trust people
1,stakmore folding table,Very poorly packed. Arrived badly damaged. Little information about refund or replacement. Will never order from this company again and can give only very negative warnings to anyone who might ask for a recommendation or comment.
4,"Good album, best one I have heard from Sam Newsome","This is a very good album. I had heard some of Sam Newsome's earlier material on CD and it was okay, it didnt quite hit me like his playing does live. This album is a bit closer to the mark and I really enjoyed it. Elements of world music blended in there but it is really driven by jazz never loses that focus, while giving you that extra taste. I'm really lLooking forward to listening to some more of his work."
3,you need to have time for this one,"I am more of a READER, even when I read of things metaphysical I am inclined to approach them on the level of intellectual understanding, not practice. If you are like me, this book is not for you. If you are so interested in learning to WORK with quartz crystals, for healing, Astral travel, chakra alignment, meditation etc, this is most likely one of the best books for that. Mind you, you will need TIME, which I dont have. Sadly. So I cannot tell you if it works.. but for some reason I have a feeling it might. Maybe some day I try it out."
3,not his best,"If you are looking for rodneys's best, buy ""Hangin with rodney"" it just is much better, i bought ""morning wood"" after bought ""hangin with rodney"" and i was not nearly as amused."
5,Rodney Carrington Review,Explicit - VERY! I did not care for a few of the tracks but it was a very funny album
1,Borrow before you buy,"I found this to be a severe and solid slap in the face for my investment. I really enjoyed Hanging With Rodney, but found this to be sad and sorry. The only pleasure I anticipate will be when I trade this in for something else. From the first moments of the CD I had the distinct impression that Mr. Carrington was not only intoxicated, but feels that swear words can take the place of genuine humor. I would strongly advise anyone interested to borrow a copy of this CD from someone prior to buying it. Be Advised."
2,Suffers from the same thing most new comedy does...,"The biggest problem with comedy recordings today is that most comedians seem torn between telling jokes and being rock stars. It must be the lights or the power of the microphone or something, but whatever it is, I wish someone would tell them that THAT'S NOT WHY WE BUY THEIR RECORDS.I immensely enjoyed his 1-track CD length ""C'mon Laugh You Bastards"", once I let myself go and get into his rhythm, which is admittedly a slow-starter kind of show. Yeah, it had some guitar-playing at the end, but it was toitally in service to the audience before him and comedy in general.THIS CD, however, has LOADS of music and not anywhere near enough straight-ahead comedy. And with a guy who slow-starts, that ain't all good, pardner. I know he makes a ton of money on he country music circuit with it, but it doesn't make it a great comedy record."
2,This accessory does not work with WII Cars: Mater-National,I bought this accessory with Cars: Mater-National game but the game does not work with this accessory. It was dissapointing!
3,Feels good for kids; could have been better,"This for sure feels better than just tilting the wiimote to turn the car. Kids really love it since they feel as if they are driving when they use the wheel. However, it needs a little getting used to since you are kind of turning the wheel in the air rather than on a pivoted point as in other game wheels.One other problem is the lack of wiimote cursor once you put it into the steering wheel. This could have addressed by simply making a small hole on the side where the IR sensor is. That way you dont have to take the remote in and out of the wheel often.Bottomline: Can live with out it, but cheap enough if kids like it."
4,Drives as Promised,"This wheel is pretty decent, especially for the price. Who can beat $9.99 with free shipping? Some people argue the wheel is not necessary, of course not, but that is not the point is it?Pros:- Great value- Good tactile feel, not slipperyCons:- Actual wireless eye is covered, which is not necessary during any games I have played. It seems like it should have been cut out though.- The controller fits in the wheel fairly snuggly, which is either a pro or a con I guess depending how you view it. I hope it loosens up some.Personally I recommand Excite Truck for a good starter game to use with the wheel, it is an instant hit."
3,Wii wheel,Bought this as a Christmas gift and it turned out to be much smaller than expected. Still works well for what it is intended for. Offers more life like experience when playing the Wii.
5,An Oldie but a Goodie!,First of all this book is not a new book but was first printed about fifty years ago. I stumbled onto my copy at a booksale a dozen years ago and have used it many times since. It is a wonderful resource for traditional New England Yankee cookery and is a great resource fo people who care about or study food history. It is full of wonderfully simple and delicious tradional recipes and captures the rich culinary history of the recent and not so recent past (the Pilgrims could have written some of these recipes!)
4,Yoga for Pregnancy,As a prenatal yoga instructor I found this book very helpful in getting ideas for my classes. I love the fact that there is the symbols in the corner to show which positions are good for what trimester. This makes it easy for anyone to regulate which positions should be done. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is just starting out in yoga or who wants to stay fit and flexible throughout their pregnancy.
3,a so-so resource,"I teach yoga, and had a 6month pregnant woman join my 2ndlevel class.I wanted to be sure to treat her tenderly.This book does have suggested postures to use for prenatal, dividing them up into trimesters, but it was weak in theory.I was hoping to understand the theory behind why she should not lay on her right side, or why she should not lower her head below her heart.Overall, as long as you follow the photos, it appears to be safe."
1,A Complete Waste of Money,"As a childbirth educator, I bought this book with a great deal of enthusiasm, but found it a complete let down. Not only were the images black and white, the binding was haphazard and the content was very mediocre."
1,False Advertising,I ordered this book based on the cover advertised on the net. The cover of the book advertised on the net was printed in 2005. The one that was sent to me was printed in 1988.I am filing a claim. This is not what was advertised and not what I intended to pay for.
1,Sorry I wasted my time and money!,"This watch arrived D.O.A. I think the battery is dead. Also, the band is so big it slides all the way up to my elbow and it doesn't look like any links can be removed."
5,Blastin'!,"This is the best B-3 funky jam album I own (and I have a lot of them). I am not sure which (*cough*) album the other reviewer is talking about. If there is a better Reuben Wilson album, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. All of the tracks are strong, with Orange Peel and Hot Rod probably leading the way. It takes the funkiest of Wilson's short late 60s- early 70s career. If you like funky B-3, this album is a must have. If you ever see this album for sale, buy it!"
4,the funky (cough) album is coming...,The funkiest Reuben Wilson album we're alluding to is a 1975 release on the Cadet label entitled 'Got To Get Your Own'. It's supa-bad! And it's coming out in July '08.
2,Not Swissco brand but a close Imitation,I ordered 3 and 1 has a small crack and 1 has the damaged bristles. It matches 90% of original Swissco product but the bristles are slightly harder.
3,Maybe OK for very fine children's hair,"This really didn't do much of anything. It seems well made and ergonomic, but the bristles were far too soft to actually go through my hair and massage my scalp. I bought a multi-pack of the cheap plastic ones and I'm much happier with those. For someone with very fine hair and a sensitive scalp (young children or the elderly), I think this would be a good choice."
3,It's cheaper elsewhere,"I have this brush and used it for the first time yesterday. I don't think it's best for thick curly hair (as it can tangle your hair), but it does leave the blood flowing in your scalp. I got a nice tingly feeling after using it. I found the exact same brush design at Sally Beauty supply for $1.99. If you have one near you save yourself a few bucks and buy it there."
3,"Good enough, but fills up with water.","We liked this brush. It felt really good on the scalp and in the hand. I'm hesitant because it fills up with water. It has drain holes, but I noticed the next day that it had condensation inside the brush. I'm concerned about mildew and mold. It is also more expensive than some of the other brushes."
3,Scalp Massager,"Really pretty ... the colors and everything, but it seemed to me this would be a little less ""stiff"". Its strands are harder than you would think, I use it sometimes, but don't love it. Not the best scalp massage at all. Would not buy it again."
4,Could not be happier,"Love this product, finally something that doen't tear the skin but yet massages well even through thick hair"
2,Voguing,"I selected this bra as it was one of few that came in a nude colour and, what looked like a nice pretty fabric and cut. In reality, when it arrived, it felt and looked more like an industrial catapult and when on, made my chest suitable for a 1990s Madonna Vogue-athon. I was rather disappointed as I have found 'pretty' nursing bras hard to find however, I have returned this one in favour for the Elle MacPherson bra which I have found extremely comfortable, flexible given the amount of back fastening options and it comes in some nice colours too."
5,Good listening music.,This kind music reminds me of the sock hops that were so popular during the '50s. I never grow tired of listening to it.
1,Childs toilet seat sold as adult size,"I was not pleased with this toilet seat. I was looking for the seats once offered by Cabelas, which they no longer carry. I found these, although at twice the cost at $85 each. But still this is what I needed for my Alaska Cabin. I ordered it and when it arrived the seat was so small that its outer edge only just caught the top of a regular sized toilet bowl, and it did not even extend far enough forward to fully cover the leading edge of the toilet bowl. People want to sit on the seat, not the actual toilet bowl.Nothing in its description prepared me for its very small size. I am not pleased.Michael Hicks"
5,OEM quality product,Got 2 of these pumps. They are sold by Beck and Arnley but they are made by Pierburg/Germany. Remove the original ones and these fit in perfectly. Recommend this product!
3,It doesn't give the best instructions and your own rules may need added.,Instructions can be vague. We got barbies and dresses to add to the fun. It can take a long time because the dice only goes to 4 getting around the board seems to take forever one player kept getting sent to the home without ever getting past the first turn. we will ignore the go back homes in the future.Can be fun but improvise.
5,Christmas Day & The Barbie Game,"I played this game with my five year old niece on Christmas Day '07.It was the highlight of the day.She opened it & wanted to play it immediately!I'd played it approximately 30+ years ago & had remembered it very wellas a very fun game.My niece was immediately learning math,dealing with the harsh reality :) of not having enough money forthe exact dress she wanted to buy & waiting til she earned more money.The funniest part that we still talk about was that she was NOT amused that she ended up with ""boyfriend"" Poindexter (a boy with light orange hair & small eyes).She wanted Ken. Ahem. My disclaimer would be..that you'd have to have a talk with the players that you don't have to have a boyfriend in real life in order to win the game of life..but in this game it is required before winning. It's a very fun game.. a replica of the original."
5,vintage board game,The Barbie Queen of the Prom game was for my granddaughter's birthday. She found my old game from when I was her age and loved playing it. It was great beiing able to get her one of her own.
4,Good silly fun,My wife has this as a child and wanted it. We've had big silly fun playing it. Good harmless fun.
2,"Dull, dull, dull - and sexist to boot!","I think I thought I was buying a remake of ""mystery date"". It's clear that most girls in the 50's had low expectations both of what ""fun"" was and about chosing your man. I bought this for my 6 year old and her favorite thing about it is the pastel colored dice.Unless you clearly remember the original game and thought it was the bomb, don't waste your money."
2,Free Soul Collection album,"Because I was expecting another smooth jazz CD, as the awesome Nite Flite album Ascension, this CD is was a disappointment; it's a soul album. It's imported from Japan, with booklet in Japanese and English"
4,Insightful!,"Say the boss drops dead and suddenly you're the acting boss. Or the company reorganizes, everyone above you is fired and guess who's in charge. Imagine that your career suddenly becomes one of those movies where the plane starts to go down and some poor, benighted sap finds himself in the pilot's chair trying to land a 747 on a stormy night on what is either a landing strip or just a long, broad swath of plankton in the water. Can you land it? What do you do? You're responsible. Suddenly people look at you in a different way. Your friends no longer completely trust you, your enemies are working actively to undercut you and your ability to come to terms with accidental leadership will make or break your career. It is full of little motivational tips, kind words and straight talk covering everything from managing complex and difficult teams to firing people (tip: avoid Christmas Eve). The book is thin, a quick read and a good one."
3,Finer mesh?,"This does strain most sediment from the wine, but still some remains. I guess it would restrict the flow of the wine into the decanter too much if it were a finer mesh. You still have to take care, but it is much better."
5,Good product,"This was purchased as an accessory to a decanter, and it went over very well! It's good to catch the sediment before going into the decanter."
2,whatever mother says,This book is written like a newspaper article. It has all the details but not really in a 'story' form. It's hard to follow but extremely interesting.
3,"Riveting Tale, Poorly Written, Anticlimatic","I could not put the book down due to this fascinating story. However, I did not like the author's writing style. It was at times very juvenile, and the author put certain passages in italics that were really corny and took away from the story. Such as *not an exact quote* her favorite color was red, a crimson red like blood would be italicized. That passage was near the end of the book and something like that should have been near the beginning......or not at all! But I digress. Anyhoo, there were other ""highlighted"" passages that subtracted from my enjoyment of the book. And the fact that he didn't do a follow-up by now on the case was extremely disappointed. It feels like he just got to the end and said f*ck it, I'm finished. Sloppy ending to a fantastic story. I wish a better writer had done this story justice."
2,eh,I found that after seeing an A&E apecial on this that there were some inaccuracies in the book. It was also very easy to put down even though the story was completely mind blowing. Could have been written a lot better.
3,Resolution?,"In response to another reviewer, not every book is meant to be nicely tied up in a bow at the end; especially books that are based on true stories. Life has no resolution, and after the horrible torture suffered by these children at the hands of their mother, the whole concept of resolution seems rather trite to me."
3,Sick,"This is about the true crimes committed by Theresa Cross Knorr, a mother of five kids. As her daughters grew up Theresa became jealous of their beauty. She convinced her two teenage sons to help her commit horrible acts upon the daughter and even to burn one alive!*** This one gives nightmares! I simply could not tell myself this was real! To murder strangers is bad enough, but to murder two of your own children is unspeakable! An insane mother who could be called a modern age Baroness of Blood! ***"
4,A Real Pageturner,"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I am still stunned that this woman is alive today and that someone hasn't shot her dead. Her poor children will never be right. All I can say is that I would like to be in a room with Terry for about 1 hour. How was she even allowed to have children. She should have been spayed long ago."
4,unbelievable is the only word I can think of.,"It's unbelievable to me what some people are capable of. The amount of evil that ran through this woman is again unbelievable. This book was a page turned, but only because you're waiting for her to be caught and for her children to finally find some peace."
2,IF YOU LIKED THE BOOK OR DIDNT LIKE THE BOOK...,"before i read this book, i saw the story on cold case files. i read other reviews and many people have commented that the book has no ending or resolution. if your interested in the story of this horrendous crime then i would try and find the cold case files program online or on A&E. you will get the full story and the end result. i saw the broadcast about four years ago and i still to this day cant shake it from my memory. unlike the book, you wont be let down."
4,Captivated,"I have read this book not to long ago, and I was horrified to learn that a mother could perform such brutality on her own flesh and blood. I am a mother myself and I can't even begin to understand the evil that lied within her. I think that Terry was such a brave soul to endure such a terrible childhood. She not only survived this but she went on the have a life of her own and she never forgot her sisters. I hope that Theresa and her sons are in prison for the rest of their lives. They can't even begin to pay for their crimes."
3,Where is Mother Now,I thought the book to be rather interesting. It was so appalling that I almost didn't believe that these things actually happened. I would like to know where Theresa Cross is now. Did she get convicted? What was her sentence? The book left it up in the air. I would like to know if this crazy women is still out there.
3,"Okay book, terrible ending","I liked this book for the most part except for the ending. After taking the time to read the book, it ended when Theresa and William were arrested. It completely left out what happened to them and what happened to Robert! Was Robert ever charged in the crime? Did Theresa and William serve any jail time? I had to go online to find the answers to these questions. I don't know why the author left out the ending unless maybe it was published before the trial ended but if that's the case, he should have waited. After reading such a horrific story about the abuse these children went through, you want to know that justice was served to their abusers. I would not reccommend this book."
1,Painfully bad writing.,"I realized that since this was a true crime book that it would not be showing up on any required reading lists for freshmen, but maybe it should be on such a list...as a lesson in how NOT to write. While, as another reviewer noted, I respect the amount of work involved collecting all of the facts, but Wensley Clarkson should leave the writing to a more capable author. I am mainly disappointed in this book because the story itself is a horrifying course of events which show us the tragedy that some people endure at the hands of others, but is served up like a traffic accident. The style used to tell the story reminded me of a sensationalistic tabloid article, but not as good. If it's the type of story itself that interests you I would advise avoiding this book and opting for something by David Peltzer instead."
3,YUCK!,"This is about the true crimes committed by Theresa Cross Knorr, a mother of five kids. As her daughters grew up Theresa became jealous of their beauty. She convinced her two teenage sons to help her commit horrible acts upon the daughter and even to burn one alive!*** This one gives nightmares! I simply could not tell myself this was real! To murder strangers is bad enough, but to murder two of your own children is unspeakable! An insane mother who could be called a modern age Baroness of Blood! ***"
1,Don't waste you time; there's no resolution to the story.,"This book is a waste of time and energy. The plot centers around a mother's murder of two of her children. However, the author doesn't take the mother to trial, nor do we find out if she's acquitted or convicted.Save your money!"
1,Doesn't Do the Story Justice,"I found this to be a poorly written and superficial account. ""Mother's Day"" by Dennis McDougal is much, much better, and provides a lot more background."
3,Terrible Ending,"If the author was so anxious to get the story out, I feel he could've at least waited until after the trial. I read this a couple of years ago and to this day have not been able to find out any information on this case at all. But, the story is absolutely horrifying and like other reviewers here, I couldn't put it down, although it made me sick."
1,Not a good read,The reason I gave this book such a low review is because it was so poorly written. I felt like I was reading something intended for a second grader. I was very diappointed by the author and the way the book was written.
3,Terry's Fight,"Many readers have accurately said this book is not the best written account of crimes so hideous they should be fiction. I still have the book but it has been a while since I've read it. What I can add is the fact that two unidentified bodies of young women were found several years apart and it was the implausible tale of Terry (who turned out to be their sister) that led to detectives uncovering their identities and ascertain they were brutally killed by one person -- their own mother. It took Terry an inexcusably long time to get police to believe her and that is too often the case, especially if the victim is female. It was her strength and determination that finally brought to life her ordeal and the ordeal of her brothers and sisters leading up to the tragic ends of both her sisters. Although it is not a complete account it should still be read by all who have a need to know not all mothers are good but are rather the epitomy of evil."
3,Is there justice?,"The author writes the story before the trial takes place; therefore, the book leaves you in suspense of what happened at the trial and if the mother got what she deserved. The book tells of all the possibilities of court but is not able to say that the mother was put to justice. Some possibilities make you feel like the court system may not make this woman pay for what she had done. Very disheartening."
2,ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!!,"I read almost the entire book, only to find out that there wasn't an ending?? I couldn't wait to find out if Teresa was convicted, and what her sentence was, only to find out that the author ended the book before that could be determined. Was the author so desperate for a pay out that she couldn't wait alittle longer to give her book the proper ending?? I am beyond disappointed. Infact I am disgusted!!"
2,better editing needed,"As a person who loves to read true crime stories, I was disapointed by the poor writing. The book was very confusing due to many inconsistancies (such as saying she was a mother of 6 in one part, and a mother of 5 in another), misuse of terms (for example interchanging the titles stepbrother and halfbrother, two very different things), and using improper words (referring to the girl as being ""mortally wounded"" when in fact, she survived the injury). It is too bad that this tragedy was not given the care and attention in writing that it deserved."
3,Interesting Story; Poorly Written,"This author's writing style is very amateurish and strange. The book is fascinating because the story is so bizarre and hard to believe, but this author should have realized his literary limitations and sought some editing help. After having read the book I was very surprised to learn that this author has actually written many books; I don't know know how anyone can stand to read them. Certainly after having read one I will never read another.Even more disappointing than the poor writing, though, was that the ending leaves you hanging. This book was written too soon. It ends with the beginning of the trial so it doesn't give information on conviction and sentencing. There are other books out there on this same story and I would safely assume they would be a better choice than this one."
5,"Now, I know the secret!","After reading this book 8X, I can truly say, I've found the Messiah, I've discovered the secret which has been hidden for ages, and now I know where this 'great power' resides. The power to call things that be not as though they were. The power to decree a thing and see it established. The power to be what and who God says we are. The power to create the life that you want. I also now understand what William Shakespeare meant, when he said: To Be of Not To Be? I finally got it, after searching for many, many years of my life. I implore you to read this book, and read it as many times as is necessary, until you too can say, I have found the Messiah. I am now ready to boldly proclaim, that me, and my Father are one, but My Father is greater than I. Enjoy this book,keep it close, this is a keeper. In closing, I bid you peace, love and much happiness. Always remember, ""YOU ARE SO DIVINE."""
2,scattershot...,"Better than this scattershot collection, is the 3-CD box set ""Rock & Roll Legends"" featuring Bobby Darin, Gene Vincent & Jerry Lee Lewis (in fact, Lewis covers BOTH Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode"" and the Big Bopper's ""Chantilly Lace""). Bobby Darin slams it out of the ballpark with a live version of ""Splish Splash"" AND provides the set's most sumptuous track with ""Once Upon A Time."" Pop in these 3 CDs and construct a perfect home stereo impromptu party set!"
4,"Review on ""The Davissons""","I feel fortunate to have a few copies of Russell Lee Davisson's book, ""The Davissons"". As my grandmother was a double Davisson in that both her parents were Davissons and it was from her that I came to love to hear about our family heritage and learn our genealogy, I am very interested to know more about this family and their time in America. Mr. Davisson's book is very informative and I too like the drawings that are in it. I am glad to have my copy as well as a few extra to give to new found cousins who also exhibit an interest in this family history."
3,"Good illustrations, Family history, Gaelic Propaganda?","Obviously, this book is not going to have wide appeal. I bought it more to put on display than read. My grandmother had done the genealogy work long ago so I already had the information.Russell Lee Davisson has done an admirable job of making a rather dry subject come alive. The illustrations are the best part, putting a face on some locations. I would have appreciated some anecdotes, or greater historical background of the time periods. At the end of the day it is a list of names. It is, after all, a genealogy book. The book itself is nice looking, and goes on display well. Nothing fancy.Some of his conclusions are a little odd, and his references to ""Gaelic Propaganda"" reveals a strange prejudice. As a student of the Scots-Gaelic language with friends in Gaelic speaking Scotland, I found this off-putting.All in all, a nice book if you happen to be a Davisson"
5,Probably the best pop-up book ever,"I used to love this book so much as a kid. Really creative scenes and many different actions. I remember the eyes moving in the pictures, swirling vortexes in the kitchen cupboard, the octopus in the sink, the skeleton in the closet... Wow. I was even sometimes a little scared to look under the flap."
2,Headphones,"These headphones only work with a certain outlet, so be sure you have this outlet/connection on your TV. I don't think many TV's have this outlet. I had to return the headphones paying postage both times."
2,Pretty disappointed,"I bought this item so my other half could sleep while I watched TV at night in the bedroom. Firstly, the jack would not fit into the tv in the bedroom so I though I'd try it on our other four tv's. It didn't fit any of them. So, off I go to Best Buy to try and buy an adapter but after going to four of their departments, no one had one. Then off I go to Radio Shack where I did find an adapter for $11.00 which did fit. Once I turned on the TV though the sound from the headphones is so low that it better be quiet in the room or you wouldn't be able to hear your movie. The only thing I like about it is the extra long cord but then again, that seems to tangle very easily. All in all I'd give it a thumbs down!"
1,Started great... quit at 8 months,"This was the perfect gift for my roommate. He once complained about the cord being so long, but he can lay back on his bed to watch TV in comfort, so not really a problem. The problem is that these headphones worked great for 8 months and then just quit. Nothing was changed. They just stopped working. I'm hoping that the seller will give us a replacement. If not, I'll be looking for something else, somewhere else."
1,why make this item,This headset is sold as a long cord tv head set The plug on the end of it is a 3.5 mm the plugs on the tv's are rca plugs I went to radio shack(why did i have to) to buy an adapter that cost around $10 i went back twice and they did'nt work Unless i have missed some thing this should not be sold for a tv.It did fit my walkmen but who needs a 24 foot cord for some thing that fits in your pocket
3,Tangled up in Sound,The headset will do but it is constantly a tangled mess of thin very thin wire.But the price was right and I can deal with it.
4,Terrifiic,"Love books about anti-heroes and, Jook's hero is a real piece of work. It's a quick entertaining read. I'm from Los Angeles and the book really gives you that LA Vibe. I love Gary's writing style."
3,Not at all realistic,"Being a fervent Bushie - the name used by British fans of the leader of the free world - I was somewhat disappointed at the lack of historical accuracy.I was after a representation of GWB in his prime, when he was single-handedly winning the Vietnam War by flying in drunken circles over Houston - this being a far braver and more difficult act than the simpler option of actually serving on the front line.Still, I gave it 3-stars because at least it arrived in the post, unlike my earlier purchase of the GWB Drill and Medical Attendance model, 1972, which was an empty box."
1,Not Honest,"While President George Bush was a Naval Aviator, George W. Bush never served as an Aviator. Don't lie to your children."
5,So Glad She's Back!,"There are three sister's music I have been waiting for years, Anita Baker, Sade, and Rachelle Ferrell. I'm still waiting on Anita, Sade's release is on November 15, but right now I have Rachelle's CD to play over and over. My, my, my , but the girl is bad!. Within two week of this release, this CD was on Billboard's top ten jazz list. From #10 Satisfied that is now getting airtime to the title track #1 Individuality it is all so good. She has the jazzy, R&B, bluesy thing all wrapped in one going on. One of my favorites is #2 Sista. But pick anyone of these eleven satisfying cuts and you will not be disappointed. Sistergirl is back!"
5,Rachelle Giving us MORE and MORE!,"She is one of the greatest LIVING american jazz vocalists/songwriters/singers. If you love music and want to hear a GREAT voice, this is a must have. In the words of Q-Tip,""...it's precise, bass-heavy, and just right..."" Trust me on this!Sister, Individuality, I Gotta Go, Gaia...this album was SOOOO slept on. If you like good music, then get this album... and also, see if you can see her live, there is no one like Rachelle... Great singer!"
5,Intoxicating,"WOW!!!!!!!!!! I need more stars to rate this CD.Individuality, what a perfect title for this CD. An idividual she is. Who can you compare her to? (No one)It is rare that I like an ENTIRE CD on the first listen. Well folks, this is one of those CD's. If you're a person who enjoys fresh, raw uncut talent, then look no further; Individuality is a must have.Although every song on this CD is worth listening to, I have a few instant favorites.Gaia (splendid duet with Jonathan Butler) I Gotta Go Reflections Of My Heart (Iridescent) I can Explain (POWERFULL)I can't believe my local newspaper gave this CD a mediocre review. Personally, I think they need to clean the wax from their ears.PLEASE spread the words to all of your friends, tell them what a GEM this piece of work is."
5,Will see her in N YC on 8/4/04!!!,"The best tracks on this CD in my opinion are 'I Forgive You"" & ""I Can Explain"". I will not be able to describe the vocal prowess and utter talent that exudes from this womans' brains, throat, fingers and toenails when I here her sing these two songs. Ms. Ferrell sings extremely well. She is what most would like to be....A VOCALIST! If you have never heard her sing, make sure you purchase this CD. She is smooth, mellow, funky, soulful and sweet.I will get the opportunity to witness ""The Voice"" in person in NYC tomorrow. I do not care what she sings ....as long as she sings ""I Can Explain"" !!!! I LOVE HER!!!BUY THIS CD, DAMN IT!! :)"
5,A WONDERFUL SOUNDING INSTRUMENT!!!!,"I'M A NEW FAN OF RACHELLE FERRELL...SO, FAR I HAVE NOT BEEN DISAPOINTED...SOUND IS GREAT, AND HER OCTIVES ARE AMAZING. HER VOICE IS AN INSTRUMENT, NOT WITHSTANDING......ABSOLUTELY GREAT!!!!"
5,An everyday concert for your soul,"After some time has passed Rachelle Ferrell has given to us Individuality (Can I be me?). This album is a concert for the soul. Rachelle ferrell has put forth the essence of true emotion, strength and rebirth, for anyone who ever needed true inspiration to stir your soul get this album and be refreshed."
5,What a Voice,"This woman has a voice that is indescribable. Vocally, I do not think that anyone can touch her or Teena Marie. Their voices are definitely God given. This CD is excellent and Rachelle is an artist in a rare form."
5,Waiting soooooo long....,"I've been pacing my floor anticipating the release of this CD and, needless to say, I am overjoyed! Rachelle has truly outdone herself with this one! The inflections in her beautiful voice still move me and the music definitely gets me groovin'. From the first track Individuality (Can I Be Me?), a declaration of the celebration of self,.....to the last track I Can Explain, a cry for the love that may be lost, which is heightened by Rachelle's piano playing. This CD is excellent and recommended to all good music lovers. My favorite track right now is Gaia, in which Rachelle is accompanied by Jonathan Butler. But, with an album as great as this, I'm sure I will have another favorite soon. Enjoy!"
4,Very nice product,"It's great, holds a lot of DVD's and CD's. Doesn't take up a lot of room, is not so high you can't reach the top shelf and it's attractive too. What more could you ask for. I liked it so much, I ordered another one for the rest of my DVD's. Great product!"
2,Childrens' Book,Skimpy on facts and other information. It's the type of book one would expect to find in a middle school / junior high school library. Not what one needs if they're looking for a scholarly tome!
3,Not what I expected,"It was a Christmas gift for my 10 year old grandson.When he tried to put it on, he could not, it was too small. Therefore, it is NOT a deluxe REPLICA football helmet."
4,Mr. Lucky boxed set,"Now somewhat campy, bit still very enjoyable, particularly from a 60s nostalgia standpoint. I remember seeing Mr. Lucky when it was originally broadcast and the Henry Mancini score (including the end music) was a hit album at that time. The best part of the show may be, however, picking out guest actors such as Jack Nicholson before they became full-fledged stars. (Just a quick note to one of the earlier reviewers--T.H.E. Cat was a show from the later 60s starring Robert Loggia and was not broadcast before Mr. Lucky.)"
4,"Exotic Cars, Here!","Name an exotic production car and it is in here. Along with beautiful color photos and a write up. Also contians performance data, which I find myself using for reference when comparing these marques. Which is faster? The Ferrari Enzo or the Lamborghini Mercialago? Good question!Get the book so when you open your mouth you will have the facts!"
5,Wonderful Healthy Snack,"This is a perfect healthy snack for 10AM or 3PM, great for those counting calories and on high protein diet."
2,Full cassette material needed on CD,"This is not the same as book/cassette original issue. Keith Wayatt is an excellent guitar advisor but he has been cut back here. Keith, please tell them the original is the best.In its current form there is plenty of better choices including the Wolf Marshall books and several specialist blues books, including those by Dave Rubin."
1,RedNeck Blues,"I purchased this book because it claimed to contain Lead Guitar styles of Albert Collins, Albert King, B.B. King, SRV, and T-Bone Walker. I first thought they put the wrong CD in the book because the style sounds more country. In addition, the CD has has limited tracks with total playing time of 20 Minutes. The tracks aren't that good. The CD sounds more like Cletus and his friends playing at the local ice house. Not worth the money."
4,Good book for someone starting out,"This contains a lot of good information that you don't learn in driving school or company training programs.Such as:- background into the different types of hauling i.e van vs. reefer, moving van, car carrier, etc.- OTR, dedicated, local routes- company driver vs. owner/operator- truck driving ""culture""- truck maintenance- every driver's friend - your dispatcher- what you need in your truck i.e. clothing, tools, foodThis is not a book for the experienced driver. Although the information contained in this book can provide some useful reminders."
3,Not mainstream music,"I have both albums, and I prefer the MIU album of the two. MIU is not a mainstream/commercial album. To truly appreciate this album, you must listen with purpose. If you are simply ""passively"" listening to this album, you'll miss out on how good it is. Best song is ""Winds Of Change""."
3,MIU Album,"MIU is definitely not as bad as they say, it opens with Brian singing his legendary falsetto. It has some cool BB type songs like Kona Coast and others. Plus great classics like Come Go With Me and Peggy Sue. It's just like with Pet Sounds, not what you'd expect from The Beach Boys. I think Bruce could have done a better job producing Light Album. It's enough to put anyone to sleep, although I like the song Good Timing."
3,NOT SO BAD AS THEY SAY...,"Although generally regarded as one of the worst Beach Boys albums, I was not frustrated after I heard the M.I.U. album. If you are a Beach Boys fan, don't hesitate to buy this two-fer issue - the album isn't so bad after all, and it's Pet Sounds compared to Summer in Paradise."
2,"""Worst of The Beach Boys"" Vol. 1","I usually can warm up to any album after a while, but these 2 I just dont vibe with at all. Bad lyrics, less than memorable melodies...one listen and thats all you'll ever need to see what I mean (Match Point!!) . Its worth owning just to say you have the whole catalog, but probably will never leave your shelf. 2 stars for a pretty funky ""She's Got Rhythm"", ""Good Timin'"", ""My Diane"" and depending on the mood I'm in, the 11 minute ""Here Comes The Night"". The only reason I like ""...Night"" is because it was the only track on LA that Brian was involved on. Defintely for completists only."
2,Mike Love's Bad Idea,"MIU in my opinion can be summed up with the words of Dennis Wilson,""This album is an embarressment to my career."" Brian Wilson had little to do with this album. Mike Love writes some of the worst lyrics imagineable. The low point is on ""Matchpoint of our Love,"" comparing love to a Tennis Match. Almost everything on this album seems forced, except for Brian Wilson's ""My Diane,"" which is a great song, but gets lost in the rest of this mess of an album. I would give this album 1 star for the one good song on it.LA album is another album that isn't very good, and had little to no activity from Brian Wilson. ""Good Timin,"" dates back from 1974, and is a good song, and the other good songs are Dennis' ""Baby Blue Eyes,"" and ""Love Surrounds Me."" I would give this album 2 stars for the 3 good songs on it."
1,Bad Stuff,"After a brief return to the band, Brian Wilson again left the band. The band's follow up to the quirky and sometimes brilliant Beach Boys Love You is the absolutely insipid M.I.U. Mike Love is a good singer and occasionally co-writes a good song, but more or less, his involvement in transcendental meditation clouded his musical vision. While one applauds Mr. Love's devotion to TM, the idea to go and record an album at a TM base in Iowa will rank as one of the worst decisions in musical history. M.I.U. suffers from bad songwriting, bad production and an overall lack of quality and it is obvious that Mr. Love is better suited to being just a singer than a bandleader. If you can listen to dreck like ""Woncha Come Out Tonight"", ""Pitter Patter"" and ""Hey Little Tomboy"" repeatedly, then you are better than me. The L.A. album is a little better than M.I.U., but not by much. These albums are for completists and the die hardest of Beach Boys fans only."
3,"It has it's moments, but the boys finally run out of steam here",Enjoyable and still the Original BBs. Yet the good songs are rarer and the production is dated. It's still better than was was to come in the next few years...
3,Beach Boys M.I.U. album,"The Beach Boys M.I.U.album suprised me in a good way.Some of the cuts are done well.Winds of Change is my favorite with good harmonies.I would rate this album based against other Beach Boys albums,so I would give it 3 out of 5 stars.Maybe if they would have spent more time on these songs,they could have been better.Overall ,I love the Beach Boys and collect all they have done. The other album on this CD is The Light Album. I give it four stars for great harmonies on Good Timin,Lady Lynda,Full Sail,and Baby Blue.I gets me a singing along.P Campbell Colorado"
3,Not A Good Place To Start A Beach Boys Collection,"This new two-fer of M.I.U. Album/L.A.(Light Album) is probably for Beach Boys completists only. The two albums both have their moments, but they are all few and far between. Al Jardine's cover of ""Come Go With Me"" is probably the highlight of M.I.U., and ""Good Timin'"" and ""Baby Blue"" are the high points of L.A. Since these three songs are on the Good Vibrations box set, anyone who owns that might wonder why they should get this twofer. Well, it is interesting to listen as a band that had just released one of their greatest albums ever(in 1977's Love You)does a double face plant with these two albums. Although, to be fair, there are a couple of decent songs such as ""My Diane"" and the above mentioned ones. And while neither album is great, they are both at least easy-going albums that can be pleasant to listen to once in a while. Once in a great while..."
4,Great cd,Hi for whoever is reading this im not some kinda musical guy that know music into depth but i really love C and Noah's voices I had the privilige of singing on the same stage as Noah's brother from the Moshav band and his father Benzion and they're such amazing nice people and you can hear that in the voices on this cd. One point i thought was that a lot lot of their stuff sounds alike but it's really good so i didn't mind that I learned a lot about music from listening to them and i'm sure that if I hopefully do well God willing I probably owe part of it to them. The cd is really good and their other stuff is also amazing
5,exactly what I wanted,these removable decals were just what we were looking for. And the price was right. How could you go wrong?
3,Destroyed by the sun,I've had this for about a year now and it did not stand up to the harsh southern California sun. It's faded and cracked. I'll have to buy another one but I guess for under $3 bucks it's not that bad.
2,Not for church or presentations - can't turn off beep,"Not much is needed from a VGA switch, and this does do the job, but I can not use it for what I bought it for because of the loud beep every time you change inputs. For some people it might not matter, but this ""feature"" which could have easily been left out makes it unusable for a lot of situations."
4,Functions adequately and reliably,"The StarTech 4-channel switch functions as designed. However, as it has an electronic switching mechanism, it must be receiving power even when ""defaulting"" to the first position. Further, the remote capability seems to require almost a 90 degree relationship with the switch before recognizing your wish to change channels.Having said that, I would buy another should the need arise."
5,Fun and easy read,"Contrary to what a few reviewers said, I don't feel that the author violated trust by writing about her personal/professional experiences with the Ovitz family and other celebrity families. There are tons of books written about all kinds of people-famous or not; so it's not like this is anything ground breaking. She only gave an honest account of her brief tenure as a nanny in Hollywood, which few of us will ever know of. But this book is more than just juicy gossip about some Hollywood celebs; you can get those from the internet or from the tabloids. No, it's also about a young woman discovering who she is (and who she's not) - and about how our society often takes for granted the role that caregivers provide, especially those that look after our future generation. Having lived in L.A. for many years and being exposed to the entertainment industry, I applaud her for her honesty, humor and most of all, her ability to have stayed sane in Hollyweird :)"
4,This is an entertaiining story that should have been told years ago,"This was a delightful and well written book. I gave it a 4 but it really was a 3.5. I say this for only two reasons. One the experiences occurred over 20 years ago so not as interesting if they were more timely. The other is that I would think there would be more gossip and name dropping to share in her story. However, I do give the author credit for telling the story with a lot of class. I couldn't have worked around people who were so fake and out of touch for one day. It was nice to hear how kind Sally Field, Debra Winger and Rhea/Danny were to work for.Nice read."
4,Predictable,Hollywood version of The Nanny Diaries. Predictable but engrossing read not requiring a ton of attention. Leaves one wondering about the movie stars not named.
3,Coming from the same side,"I had previously read the Nanny Diaries so when I saw this book on the shelf at the store and though lets see what this book is all about. Being a former Nanny myself I related several of own experiences to hers. I think her account was not over exaggerated by any means.The writing and her thought process seemed quite naive at times, it was a quick and fun read overall."
3,not the best book I've read,"She kept making the same mistakes and then blaming it on the people she worked for.Sometimes you have to live with your mistake.I felt like she wrote the book just to complain.If you like hearing people constantly complain then buy this book, if not then buy a Dan Brown book.He is an amazing author."
1,Don't Bother,I bought this book as I had read in the papers that she had been the nanny for Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. She was not! Not only that but her experiences as a nanny are about twenty years old - hot Hollywood gossip it's not. I wouldn't waste my money on this money. The Nanny Diaries is a far better read.
4,Interesting!,"I thought this book was very cute to say the least. But at the same time, I couldn't help but wonder if everything was true! I don't think she blamed her employers at all. She blamed herself quite a lot for not being able to stick up to them. And with good reason too! Look what happened when she finally did!"
3,Sally Hansen's Hollywood Nanny stories,A light and entertaining read. Not many Nannies get to work in the rarefied atmosphere of Hollywood stars. The author records intimate details of her thoughts and feelings workin with 3 celebrity families. It was a very enjoyable read.
4,I was hooked on it until I finished it.,I really enjoyed this book and was hooked from the start. Probably had to do with it was a hollywood story and I really enjoyed the Nanny Diaries and was looking for something along those lines. I was disapointed when the book ended!! I would definantly recommend to my friends.
2,Could've Been Better,I came away from this book feeling bad for the children. I just don't think its right to have their early childhood and their parents personalities dredged up for book sales just because there was no signed confidentiality contract. I somewaht sympothize with Suzy's experience but I also dind't see the purpose. The book was not thta enthralling.I'd also like to point out that she stated that she changed the children's names. I want to know what good did that do? She kept the parents name the same.
2,Everyone in this book needs to grow up!,"I bought this for the airplane, and it's a perfect airplane book - light and easy to read and instantly forgettable.A 19 yo is hired to look after the Ovitz's 3 children. Unfortunately, even though she is well beyond 19 at the time of writing, her insights are that of a 19 yo and not that interesting or original. This is not a well written book, it could have been far funnier or cleverer. You never read it for the heroine, only for the far more famous/intersting people that she meets and she doesn't really have much of interest to say about them (I met Tom Cruise, I could have died!) I left it at the airport for some other traveller to read..."
2,Nanny Diaries.....with palm trees,"I usually try to give everything I read a break, but this book was nothing new or exciting. It had a couple of briefly funny spots, but other than that, it was kinda blah. Maybe it would've been more exciting had I not read the Nanny Diaries a couple of years ago. This book did, however, give you insight into why some rich kids are so nuts - because they're nothing more than an accessory for their parents."
2,"If I hear ""heaving breast"" once more I'll puke...","While this book does have some exciting parts, in general my SO and I found it to be quite repetitive. Neither of us believe that it was written by a woman. It is, however, packed-full-o depraved sex, so it can't be *ALL* bad, can it? We gave it along with others to my sister-in-law (who's working on an erotic story for a writing class) as an example of how NOT to do it."
1,unhappy,"I ordered this cd because it said that it had ""There Are Seven Days"" but it doesn't. It doesn't have several songs that is says it has on the back of the case. I really am upset. I would like to return it."
5,MY DAUGHTER LOVES BARNEY,MY DAUGHTER LOVES BARNEY AND THIS CD IS PERFECT FOR LONG ROAD TRIPS OR JUST A FUN TIME. I RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANY PARENT WHO NEEDS A BREAK!!
5,GREAT CD!,"This is a great collection of Barney favorites, with traditional songs as well. When I got this CD, my daughter was not hooked on Barney yet and I was just looking for a good collection of children's songs to play in the car. Well she got hooked on his voice and now she is hooked on his big purple self too. Between the ""Great Day to Learn"" CD and this CD, we are all set. Even if she is cranky, just hearing the Barney theme song turns everything around. I realize that not everybody likes Barney, but that is no reason to give a lousy review with no justification. I was wary of the purple guy myself but this CD and the ""Great Day to Learn"" CD attest to Barney's appeal to both kids and parents alike. I would recommend this even for non-Barney fans, it is a good collection of songs that are very energetically done."
1,wrong product,"We ordered this CD along with Barney's favorites vol. 2, and strangely, the songs were identical on both CDs (all of the songs on Barney's Early Years were the songs which appeared on the vol. 2. We were disappointed since we selected the Early Years CD due to the fact that several of my daughter's favorite songs were listed on the Early Years CD. We contacted Amazon and they exchanged the Early Years CD for another Early Years CD, thinking it was a crazy fluke with the manufacturer. However, the exact same issue occured with the replacement Early Years CD! The songs listed on the back of the CD are not on the CD. We have returned the replacement as well and are giving up on this particular Barney CD."
5,Just what I wanted!,I bought this for my granddaughter because I owned it on cassette tape for my kids when little and I wanted it for her too. We sing along with it in my car.
5,wheel chair,This was a great investment.!!!!!!I would recommend this to any one and very easy to use and itcame all put together.
2,Returned chair,"I had to return it as it was big for my house needs,it did not go thru the doors.Sad that you have ""CHARGED 15% ""on its return as relocation or some thing charges.You ought to refund this 15% charged as I got 18"" chair from you."
3,Good value,I thought I would have to pay over $500-1000 for a wheelchair. Little did I know prices are fairly cheap nowadays.
4,BEST VALUE,I can hardly believe how fast I received this chair. I ordered it on Sunday and received it Tuesday before 2:00p.m.! It is exactly what I needed for my husband. He is at the point where he can hardly walk and this will give him mobility. It is easy to handle and easy to fold up. It is the best value for my money! It is a little heavy but I can deal with that. I only wished I had ordered this sooner. It has been on my wish list for a long time. You will not regret purchasing this chair.
4,Terrific value,"We bought this wheelchair to keep in the family for use when taking my Dad places that are too difficult for him to walk. I ordered it and it was at my door in a couple of days. It is very well built and the footrests are easy to put on and take off. It pushes easily and has a pretty smooth ride. I would have given it 5 stars but since it's use is limited I can't speak to its durability. Also, I think the ""lightweight"" name is a bit misleading. My husband and brother can handle it, but for a smaller woman, even without the footrests, it is difficult to lift in and out of the car. But I'm not complaining. The very reasonable cost of this chair as opposed to rental prices for comparable equipment, make this purchase a no brainer!"
3,Be careful with returns,"I returned this product because it didn't fit my mother. So far, I have seen the following business entities on my paperwork: Amazon, Medlife, Miracle Medical Supply, Invacare, Invacare Distribution Center. I have return delivery confirmation from 17 days ago, but no credit yet in my bank account. I called Medlife, and they say they are going to call Invacare, and if it shows returned, they are going to credit my bank account. Just make sure you have all your info including return authorization # before you return an item, and follow-up to make sure you get your money back."
4,A nice low priced wheel chair for those of us who need it sometimes.,"This chair is comfortable and easy to be pushed in. Good maneuverability. Fits through most doorways.But, it is not a full time wheelchair, if you need to be in a chair everyday this is not the best choice for you."
5,Very Pleased!,Wheelchair arrived very quickly & it was already assembled (in closed position) which was very important; very pleased with the quality ot the product and the entire ordering process!
4,Lightweight Wheelchair review,"This chair worked out very well for my mother. It is lightweight, manuevers easily, fold easily. The only problem we had was the footrests were not sent with the wheelchair. I called Amazon, they referred me directly to the company, I e-mailed them and received the footrests promptly. The original shipment came within 3 days, no additional charge. We are very satisfied. We did purchase the slightly larger chair so Mom could put her purse, etc along side of her. She says the chair is comfortable, and it is easy for us to push, so it's a win-win."
5,company shipped missing footrests!,"good solid discount wheelchair, but was missing the swingaway footrests.after email, the company shipped them in 2 days!I chose the 20"" wide seat for my Mom and it makes the chair 28"" wide overall, fine to clear our narrow halls carefully when pushed by another.not an easy chair to self-navigate. folds easily but heavy and bulky."
1,Battery dead on arrival!!!,This battery was dead on arrival. I did not send it back because I would have spent more to send it back and replace it.
5,Your life can be Yours,"To me discovering my Identity was invaluable. It gave me an entirely new perspective on the challenges I have faced throughout my life and the reason why I found myself in the same types of situations again and again.To discover yourself is to be at peace with yourself. You deeply understand who you are and what you truly want. No longer tied to the struggle of trying to make yourself be someone you are not, you are free."
4,A useful gadget,"I bought my first Intermatic Security Timer about nine years ago, and just bought a replacement, because the original was starting to lose time. At this low price, I don't mind replacing it every nine years. I've been very happy with this timer. I use it to control a lamp in my bedroom, and have never noticed any clicking or buzzing, as other reviewers had noted. In the winter, I set it to go on when I get up in the morning and off when I leave for work, and to be on when I get home. Of course, I use it when I go on vacation. The security feature is the variable timing, so I don't recommend it for anyone who wants it to go on and off at the same exact times."
3,Functional but noisy,"This is a good, functional, basic timer. We have several. They work well. However, the mechanical gears make a racket, at all times. The gears can be heard from more than 20 feet away. These devices are not recommended for bedrooms or other areas where a person seeks quiet. In bedrooms and our den, we are replacing mechanical timers with digital timers."
3,Does the job,This is a basic timer that performs its function adequately. Only criticism I have is that the clock timer mechanism can be a little too easily moved by an inadvertent movement when you are holding the unit.
4,"""security"" means imprecise timer","Maybe I was in too much of a hurry to realize what I had ordered, but when I got the timer in my hands it was clear that it is designed to be imprecise. It varies the off and on times by about 15 minutes from what is set to give the impression that the timed function is being operated by a human and not a timer. That's good for lights when no one is home for security - not so good when one actually wants the timer to operate consistently. I wrongly assumed from the description that it might me a controllable feature."
4,Having a Wild Weekend DVD.,Good for the age of the movie. wish it came out on blu ray. But I can live with it. It's been a long time no see!!!!!!
3,Good time for a nap,Some pretty cool tunes..but not much of a plot..funny band scenes..but DAVE CLARK is way more a winey + proper = boring worth a watch for old times sake or maybe someone young after the bars are closed and you are prepped for this 60s gem...almost as bad as HOLD ON/Hermans Hermits..The Beatles movies were way better..
2,Succeeded at Being the Anti-Thesis of the Beatle Movies,"I just viewed the movie and simply could not get through it because it was very strange. My conclusion is that someone did not want to appear to be mimicking the Beatle movies, so they made this very slow-moving, did not focus at all on the fact that these are musicians, and did not want to merely appease their fans. Clearly it's meant to be an ""arty"" movie because there's a lot of brooding, scenery shots, strange conversations, and things that made me go ""what?!"" I felt like I was watching this in ""real time"" at times because it took so long for things to happen.I love DC5 so I was disappointed by this movie. I suppose they succeeded on some level, but I would have preferred the usual fun, silliness, and music. [I actually laughed more reading these reviews than I did while watching the movie--eg. Lenny playing a mute *LOL*]"
4,great short words of encouragement,"i lead worship at our church on sunday mornings and for our youth group and this book is helping increase my hymn knowledge. so many of these hymns we sing are void of the story behind it. while this book doesn't delve deeply into the writers, it gives little glimpses in case you want to purse it further."
4,Would love a companion CD of the music,I just downloaded this for Kindle... I would love to find a companion CD or audio book that included the music.
5,outstanding reprovutions of edward hopper works,This is the finest reproductions of edward hopper pictures ever. The price coupled with the picture reproductions with such vivid color make for and outstanding value.
4,A nice reference book for computer science,"Dewdney does a nice job in covering a wide range of topics (e.g. NP completeness, codes, formal languages) that computer scientists take for granted as ""common knowlege"". It serves as a nice encyclopedia for both computer scientists and a layman with some mathematical background who is curious about some of the disciplines of computer science. A great book to have on your shelf."
2,Rather useless,"Perhaps I had mistaken the purpose of this book, but I had expected something more of a springboard into new topics. I found that this book went into details about things I was already familiar with, but didn't give much information about things that were more interesting and unfamiliar."
4,pretty almost on it,"hey its great how they seem to got all these musical influence things going on for them, the dead or alive and etcetc,they got some energy yeah but i feel that this guys voice is lacking a little in power. i think theres the potential there but its stuck somewhere inside his him.. most likely in his throat. i mean they put all the right stuff in the oven but it needs a little time to cook if you know what im sayin. although they seem to be better than alot of stuff ive searched out on cdnow today, if that helps any."
4,"Good content, but dated and few images","Note: I used the book for a graduate course on interpretation of image and text, not for the exact purpose of the authors (audience--teachers of writing). It has worked out fine, because the essays are relevant. However, be aware that most of the chapters were written when widespread access to the Internet was new. These authors explore interesting aspects of ""the digital world,"" but this has seen a great deal of change and our students are more digital-savvy than the students these authors imagined in their writing. Also, for a book on visual rhetoric, there are few images."
3,Cooks Illustrated Reader Beware,"If you are purchasing this item as a result of reading the Jan/Feb 08 Cooks Illustrated, you may want to reread p. 32 of your magazine: The cutting board tested and recommended is Amazon item #B0006FRAGQ. This is not the cutting board tested by Cooks Illustrated."
1,This is not the cutting board you are looking for.,"Expensive, ordinary, NOT dish-washer safe. This is not the cutting board you are looking for."
4,"Worth it for ""Virtue"" and ""Summertime""","Great ensemble playing. Toots Thielmans, Dizzy Gillespie, and Mongo Santamaria's group put on a fantastic show. This live recording is notable for ""Virtue"" and ""Summertime"". Dizzy's trumpetsounds a bit wheezy at times but the group sounds GOOD!"
2,Don't Knock Monty Until You've Spent Time With Him,"I read the book The Man Who Listens To Horses and say the PBS special on Shy Boy. Then I attended two seminars a year apart. I got to talk to Monty and ""read"" his face and body language. People give themselves away by their actions. After meeting Monty, studying him and learning his methods, I have a very strong tendency to believe him. I was an abused child and most of the beatings by my parents were never known about by the neighbors. The other forms of abuse were also hidden until the cops finally caught my dad and sent him to prison where he belonged. I've never really recovered but I vowed my children would not be raised like me. Nor would my animals be treated to breaking with spurs and whips. Monty's methods worked on every horse I have. The horses are so much more trustworthy when they believe they can trust humans. Over the last four years the Monty Roberts method is the prime method we use on our ranch."
1,Perceptions are often different,"There really does seem to be a great deal of bitterness in Monty's family. That itself is a giveaway. If Monty's father really was the good guy they make him out to be, there would be no need at all to try and smear Monty's reputation. My own mother beat me (with a kind of sadistic pleasure) and was completely convinced she was doing the right thing, even calling it ""God's work"" and completely convinced of the need to ""break your child's spirit"", much the same way that people ""break"" horses. Needless to say, I still have some serious issues with my mother while on the other hand my sister absolutely adored her (""you don't beat girls"" my mother always said.)Yep. Monty's story has a ring of truth to it while his relatives just seem to be jealous of his success and honesty. Pity."
1,Pictures speak a thousand words,"Just look at the pictures of Monty's father beating and misstreating horses and you'll know who the man is. Animal abusers always turn against people too,especially children or women who are ""weaker"". In any country in Europe,Monty's father would spend the rest of his life in prison,and rightly so, for torturing his horses, not speaking of what his did to his son.How can anyone defend this person?"
4,Truth doesn't sell as well as fiction,"I was pleased that Monty Robert's relatives wrote to refute the stories he told about his up-bringing and business dealings. I felt sorry for him when I read ""Man Who Listens to Horses"" and thought how noble of him to overcome such oppression. However, based the family's documented story in ""Horse Whispers & Lies,"" Monty is all LIES and marketing. The true family story still isn't getting the exposure it deserves--it should be sold as a package with Monty's book. Monty's karma will reward him ultimately."
4,Useful text,"This text's tables and images are well thought out, and the chapters seems very even for a multiauthor book. I use this book more than any other on a daily basis..Maybe not exactly 5 stars, but I do wish I could give it 4.5! Great job."
1,Critical wire broken at base,"Each bulb socket has two wires for power. When I turned on the light, both lights versus one (selectable on the switch), only one came on. I reversed the bulbs and tried again, again only the same one side came on. I then thought something was wrong inside the metal enclosure. So I got the top removed and saw that on the non-functioning light side one of the wires was broken right at the base into the socket. To fix would have taken a soldering iron and solder, which I did not have, nor the inclination to buy one to fix this. Since I had completely disassembled the light and had torn up the packaging to get to the light, I gave up and pitched the whole thing. BTW the housing quality is very poor as well. Why they did not use heavy duty plastic I do not know. I would definitely NOT purchase this piece of garbage again."
3,Simply a collection of mediocre articles,"Though it supposedly covers all the issues related to add(medication,legal etc.) this book simply lacks the substance. Try searching with google.com instead."
3,easy entry into lower-fat eating,"This book is aimed at folks accustomed to classic Fannie Farmer who don't want to change their eating habits drastically, but want to know they are doing something to decrease the fat in their diets. It includes recipies for main dishes, side dishes, and desserts--with nutritional counts on each one--plus menus, and information on fat and cholesterol. The dishes aren't complicated, and lots of pretty photos are included. My favorites have been the recipe for practically guilt-free chocolate pudding and the one for a lemon-mustard sauce for asparagus or broccoli."
4,great light,best $60 tac light out there. it is well built and met the streamlight standards of quality. I would recommend an LED light though for those who can afford the extra cost.
3,Doesn't show alot,"This book shows pal-gwe forms 1-8, tae-kook forms 1-8, koryo, kumgang, and tae book. If you are looking for a book on the technique of kicks, punches, etc., then don't by this book(it shows some but doesn't have much pictures for them). The pictures of the forms are sort of detailed but very small compared to the ones in ""Tae kwon do: the ultimate reference guide to the world's most popular martial art."" Another thing is: the stances and hand/kicking techniques are explained in korean. This may help u study korean terms better but it is sort of a waste of time. For a book thats $10.36, i'd say its not bad for the price."
2,This book is confusing,This book is basically lists of things rather than text which makes it hard to learn from. The forms drawings are small and hard to follow (and some of the names are spelled wrong). There are a lot of better books out there that cover each of the subjects in this book in more detail.
3,A Good Read...,"I liked this book a lot. It's my first Ben Counter novel, but won't be my last. Well written and reasonably well paced.My only gripe is that the battles scenes seemd a bit too perfunctory to me, as if the author was going through the motions just to get past them and on to the more interesting parts, such as character development and backstory (which are both done well I think). Battle scenes lacked real intensity and emotion in my view.But nevertheless, I still recommend it."
5,No snow shovels for sale in Georgia,"Every other winter in the Metro area of Atlanta we do get the occasional snowfall of 2-6 inches. Unfortunately none of the home improvement store sale snow shovels just the salt crystals which is fine but you would have to wait a day or two for the snow to melt. The shovel itself is sturdy and seems durable, thanks Amazon."
4,"Good shovel, but a bit too short","This has no steel wear strip, which I like, but it's only 47.5 inches, so it seems to put more stress on my back than my 51 inch plastic pusher. Apparently, Suncast no longer makes the pusher without the metal wear strip. I like plastic shovels without steel wear strips because I store them in my apartment and metal wear strips probably aren't good for my floor and I don't like using them around my car either. I'll be looking for a longer handled plastic pusher with no steel wear strip. The Suncast SN1000 is still an ok shovel. The screws are good smooth non-sharp phillips. Some cheaper brands use glove ripping sharp hex head type screws. Also the handle is very good and it's easy to clean."
5,Nemo didn't stack up to this shovel,"34 inches in 24 hours was nothing this shovel couldn't handle. Dug out a 2 car driveway, a 50 foot walkway, my girlfriend's car and mine out. No complaints at all. Best purchase I made in the last 6 months.Not so good with ice, but at the price it sells it does exactly what it is supposed to do."
4,A near perfect crime con thriller,The Author brings out the flawed personality of the the main protagonist perfectly.You are rooting for him as he plans and executes his con.But then does crime pay and does he come by his just desserts?Block builds up his plot and then executes it with finesse.
3,Strange Fun,A good read. Especially for the price. Good turns in the story withoutcreating confusion. It's not an award winner but it's good stuff!
4,"Hardly Block's best, but still a good example of crime novels from this era","I picked this up when it was one of Amazon's summer specials. It was an interesting read, mostly because it underscored how far Block has come in his career. This is a fairly typical example of what was on the market back when it was written. Theere's certainly nothing wrong with the book, but it's nothing like the later Block classics like Eight Million Ways to Die. For hard core Block fans, this is a must read. For everyone else, there's much better Block to be had."
4,Early Block. Good -- but not his best.,"Block's early and middle Matt Scudder novels are great. His Hit Man novels are very worth reading. His other output is, to me, anywhere from fair to poor. This book, in the Raymond Chandler style, is worth a read. Not great, but good."
3,Little bit of a let-down,"I am not overly familiar with Block; I remembered his name from the old Alfred Hitchcock Magazines and PB anthologies. The cover was delicious, though, so I thought I'd try it.I could hardly put it down ~ the writing is great, the suspense was tense, I did expect some surprises at the end and did guess part of it right... however, I expected a bit more of an explosive ending in the last three chapters or so; instead, after the initial twist was revealed, those chapters turned out to be little more than anti-climactic, with no more appearances of or retribution for the title femme fatale. Sorry, guys. But while I was reading it, I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought 3 more in this series. I look forward to enjoying them."
2,I WAS CONNED OUT OF .99,"NO SUSPENS, NOR SURPRISE AT THE END IT JUST WENT THUD I GUESS IF YOU ARE A GRIFTER YOU MIGHT ENJOY THIS BOOK BUT,TO ME, IT STARTED OFF WELL AND THEN IT WAS ALL TO APPARENT WHO WAS BEING CONNED"
3,A bit disappointing,"As a fan of mysteries and crime fiction, I looked forward to reading the re-issue of Block's story from the 1960's. I was especially impressed by the strong reader reviews the novel received. Unfortunately, perhaps due to the build-up, I was a bit disappointed in the book. Although Block lays out his story line very well and has the mechanics of a con down pat, I found the narrative entirely without suspense and the ""surprise"" ending fairly predictable."
2,WORST OF THE COLLECTION,I own and have watched every title comprising this series to date and I have never seen a worse collection of titles than this last lot of After Dark Horrorfest Vol.4. Some films start out well but then drift off into slow nonsense and some others are pure gore with no acting. I would recommend watching these first before you buy if you can.
1,Don't believe the clever trailer,"Hi, we bought this box because of the clever trailer. However, don't let it fool you! In this box you will find not even 1 (!) movie worth watching. Bad acting, bad directing, bad stories, with top of the crap: Lake Mungo.I've thrown it in the bin and worst of all: this box doesn't even come cheap."
5,Cuts out the mystery of weight-loss,"No ""huggy,"" feel-good philosophy here. Laurie Bell's book is a wake up call for the weight-loss crowd. I liked her to-the-point, no nonsense approach. People fail themselves because they cling to a number of deceptive lies. As a champion body builder, mother of 2 and a holder of a Master of Science degree, she knows what she is talking about.--Doug Setter, BSc, author ofStomach Flattening"
3,Just isn't the same without Jack,"After watching seasons 1-8 repeatedly, we had to buy season 9, even though Jack O'Neil has retired. Sam is my favorite character and I was very concerned when she didn't appear very much in the first few episodes (then I remembered maybe she was on maternity leave?). It's great to have Sam and Daniel and Teal'c but without Jack. It just isn't the same. The Goa'uld are gone, but there's a new bad guy - the Ori. The Ori plot line is just not as interesting until the very end of season 9 and even then I'd say Seasons 1-8 beat season 9 hands down. It's worth getting if you love watching Stargate, and need something to do. But Stargate Atlantis is better. I kind of wish Stargate SG1 ended with season 8. Season 9 is just an average tv show."
2,Stargate SG-1 Seasons 9 and 10,I have seen some of the episodes in this two seasons. The majority of the DVD's are scratched and do not play smoothly. I have not been able to finish this records.I did not return them because of the time between receipt and when I had the opportunity to view them. I have not seen the Atlantis disks. I'll see what happens when I do have time to watch them. Completely disappointed!
4,The Avalon Arc,"Buying this season is worth it for the Avalon story alone (episodes 1-3)These are among the best aired since the third season. Unfortunately the focus strays and the season doesn't hold up but there are some good stories later as well (Prototype, Camelot).I recommend season 9. Some of it is simply outstanding (character, acting, story, script, sets and costume)."
1,Cheap Switcheroo...,"Originally placed the order for the non-Thinpak release as Amazon had listings for both the original-style 5-discs box set and the ""new"" slimline Thinpak.Seems MGM decided not to release this box set in the original style; annoying to say the least. They've previously released seasons 1 through 8 in the old-style. SG-1 is now a cancelled series -- so what's the harm with releasing the same style for the last two releases (Season 9 & 10)??This is not unlike the Simpson's box sets which were changed in season 5 to ""head shots"" of Simpsons characters. After much protest, their distributor came out with original box set-style releases.Smaller package... less inserts... looks puny on the DVD rack next to the other EIGHT seasons... same price. Gotta love that marketing plan!I'm returning mine and waiting on the hopes MGM will come to some sense and release the final two seasons old-school."
1,Wrong size box,"I am sorry that the box that the DVDs came are not the same size as the other 8 series I have. It makes my collection look "" Not Complete"" I guess they did that to save some money like everyone else is doing now days. The stories are getting more complicated and stupid all the time. I wish I had not bought it. The first few I got were really good.Bob"
5,Avalon part1 and Avalon part2,"I really enjoyed these two episodes, It had a lot of advanture, some comedy, and suspense. I hope Daniel+ Vala get married. They make an interesting couple. I also loved Origen, and the other episodes too. Could you e-mail me back, on when I can buy season ten boxed set. Keep me posted. Thank you."
2,DVD disk don't work!,Star Gate SG-1 Season 9 that I bought only two (2) of the Five (5) disk work. Would like to get a refund!
1,not happy,"I have all season box sets in collection. Ordered this and received ""thinpak""Wrote to Amazon telling them that this is not what I ordered and sent it back.They replaced it with the same ""thinpak"". So much for a matched set. I don'tbelieve that this comes in the original format that seasons 1-8 came in."
1,Don't believe the reviews!,"I have enjoyed watching Stargate SG-1 up until season 9. This season, on the other hand, has lost its spark. There was no clear transition between season 8 and 9. Characters left and were introduced for no apparent reason and there is no cohesion between the team members. What was once a clever well-thought-out sci-fi drama has been demoted to a stereotypical space opera with poor acting, bad plots, and tasteless costumes better left for such flops as Farscape and Andromeda. General Landry's eyes are spooky, not to mention his bad acting and the unnecessary plot with him and his daughter with the grudge. Sound familiar? Yep. It's been done already. Oh, and whatever happened to the romance between Sam and Jack? Did he retire and forget about his crush? Who does that? Do yourself a favor. Stop watching at season 8. You'll thank me later."
5,"Cases, New Group","First, I was a little leary of the more smaller space saving thinpaks. We were not sure they would be sturdy enough for a move and/or if young kids accidentally get hold of it. Bot happened and they are doing very well so far. We love the space saved even though it doesn't exactly match all the previous seasons.Second, I was leary of so many changes for this season and had only been able to see a few episodes since we rely on the airwaves for our regular TV viewing. We have been pleased so far to see much of what we enjoy still in the show although we would prefer the original cast and with more interaction with a secondary group made up of some newcomers instead of what we see. The show is still too good to pass up on and the DVDs view so much like movie quality that we still have to give it the full 5 stars. Wish they could just keep them coming and faster!These SciFi nuts consider it a ""must buy""."
4,SG1,"This episode was kinda neat. I intended to comment on the irritating telephone ringing sound everytime the Stargate is open. I don't know who's stupid idea it was to introduce that irritating ridiculous background noise that never seems to end, but you see this a lot in television series. I think sound people need to learn to differentiate from useful and irritating. Detracts from the experience. Less is better, being able to hear the dialogue is key, not noise......."
1,Compared to the previous....? drek,"As a huge fan of the Stargate that went before and not such a huge fan of FarScape, it was a complete disappointment to see Stargate turned into a clone of every other silly tv oriented science fiction 'western' as it became FarScaped.Gone are the serious portrayals of dedicated folks exploring the universe and doing their best to overcome adversity...and welcome to Battlestar Galactica (and not the good one) meets Farscape.I bought all the final seasons seasons with Ben Browder and Claudia, and I never even opened the last one. Couldn't watch it. Just too insulting to my intelligence and sense of good Sci fi."
4,Very good,I have been an SG1 fan since the begining and after watching season 9 I can't wait till I get season 10. It's a good season worth the watch.
5,Stargate SG - 1 - Season 9,I really enjoyed all of the action. The plots were very well put together. The Stars were great. If you like science fiction this great. My family and I loved it . I can't wait to get season 10
5,sg1 rules,A another great season captured on DVD..Excellent quality and I like the new slim pack for storage...Where's season 10?
4,Still Good but We Miss Jack,Love theSG1 series. It's well written and acted. Season 9 is this first without Col. Jack O'Niel. Most of the humor is now gone.
5,Excellent Season,Great show and this season was excellent. If you like Stargate you'll absolutely love Season 9 of Stargate SG 1.
5,Andromeda slipstream series,Very easy purchase. I would recommend this seller and would consider buying from them in the future! Great job and thank you!
5,Great TV Show,"This is one of my favorite shows of all time, and the best sci-fi show ever. I loved the Movie, and I dig the way the TV show has played out over the years. I own the entire collection."
2,How cheap can you get?,"I am a big fan of Stargate SG-1 and waited patiently for the 9th season to come out on DVD. Imagine my disappointment when I got the 5 disc complete season 9 and they have doubled up the disks, 2 to a case, and they are in slimline cases; the overall effect is cheap looking. I already own the first 8 seasons in the original box sets so this one will stick out like a sore thumb on my shelf. I notice the price of the set didn't change."
3,jumped the shark a long time ago,"So Sci Fi Channel is letting SG-1 die a merciful death--finally. The show jumped the shark about two seasons ago. Let it die, folks. Atlantis has ably picked up the theme. Still, if you have all the other box sets, you'll need this (and 10 when it comes out) to have a sense of finality."
5,Stargate SG-1 Season 9 boxed set,I found this set very satisfying. I love watching without commercial interruptions and the video was clear and sharp. No skips or problems. I highty rate it for other SG-1 fans
5,Excellent!,"Beautiful DVD set with good extras. The thinpak is very nice - more room on my shelf!This is a must have to complete your collection for every SG-1 fan. If you're new to the series, buy the entire collection - Seasons 1-9! I highly recommend them!!!"
4,Stargate SG-1 -#9,"Big fan of this series - New members of cast are good except the character ""VALA"". Old members of cast are great."
2,Stargate SG-1 Season 9 Box Set (Thinpak),This is and awesome series but even though it had some great episodes the it was a disappointing season. 200 the 200th episode really sucked.
2,I was disappointed with this shovel.,"I got this for Christmas for my granddaughter because she likes to help when we shovel snow. For the price, I expected something much sturdier. The red shovel part is not very thick and seems brittle, it looks like it would break if you tried to use it on hard-packed or icy snow. The shovel is held onto the PVC handle with a single staple on the back. The D-grip is very narrow and rounded, making it awkward to hold. And the grip is black, not red, a minor factor, but still, it's not as cute. When I saw a much better shovel at my local grocery store for only $5.50, I decided to send this one back. Amazon's return process was easy and quick."
2,Not What I Expected,"Having read other works of Henri Nouwen, I thought this would be a very thought provoking and reflective book to use along with my Scripture readings during Lent. Instead, I found it rather introspective and self-probing. It did not promote the tranquility or serenity of contemplative thought I found so prominent among his other books."
5,Lent with Henri... Wondeful!,"The past two years I have used this book as a part of my Lenten journey. It is by far one of the most consistent devotionals I have used for some time. The format makes it easy to pick up and read for a minute, or for an hour. The substance revolves around traditional Lenten themes, yet I was finding myself thinking in directions that were new for me, all under the tutelage of Nouwen. What a wonderful mentor in all things spiritual. Very Christ centered, all of it good news."
5,Good topical acne treatment,Great product to use at night for topical treatment of cystic acne. Been using for years. When first using it takes your skin some time to adjust. Use very small amount in the beginning or your skin will flake if you have never used a product like this before.
5,How to Dress for Success,"I am very thankful for had find a book that helps on How to Dress for Success, because let's face it... it is difficult to find business attires that is elegant, profesional and inexpensive. Thank you."
2,So Incredibly Boring.,"The book is out of date enough to be insulting and boring, and yet not out of date enough to be funny and entertaining. It's full of common sense so called advise and talk of hats, gloves, stoles and furs. Alot of housedress and cocktail dress mentions. Terrible. One funny I managed to find was that she uses the word marketing as going to the grocery store. Awful to think that at the time her advise was considered useful and not just stating the obvious."
3,Very limited customer support,"Used the (check to see if this part fits your car) at the top of the page and it said this wouild fit my 2010 Jetta, Tryed to get fit confirmation from costumer service but no responce. Did not fit but thirty days had since the purchase while waiting for other parts so return requested was rejected. Won't by from this seller again."
3,Okay book,"The book was, for the most part, an entertaining read. However, the one thing I couldn't shake was that the hero's actions could easily be called stalking. He did not just show up to parties and events where he knew she would be (which, in real life, would be unacceptable, but from a Harlequin hero, perhaps). He shows up at her doorstep, repeatedly, after her repeated requests for him to leave her alone.If you can get past that, or gloss over it, it's a good book."
5,excellent,"First one was dead on arrival, the motor did not run, the 2nd one works perfectly, easy to set time, easy to set on and off. Really nice. To bad the first one was DOA."
1,Huh,I purchased two of the Lamp Timers so that my dogs would have lights on when it got dark. I orded this brand because it got such high stars. Neither one worked consistantly and were very cheap. I went to Target and bought a cheaper one that works!
3,not quite what i thought....,"Okay, so yes it turns the lamp on and off at set times...but then you are not supposed to use the lamp any other time??? I must admit I didn't read instructions...this info is per my husband... but sometimes I want to turn on the lamp other than the ""set"" times...he says it messes up the schedule.Otherwise it works fine and is nice to come home to a lit home."
3,GOOD FOR LAMP ON/OFF SETTINGS,"This timer is a good product for lamp on/off settings, if you are not so critical with the time, because it has a delay of 15 to 20 minutes between the time you set to on/off and the time it actually turns on or off."
1,"Off switch doesn't work, dial doesn't light up.","This product is worthless. The ""off"" switch trips only occasionally, leaving any lamp attached to it burning 24/7 - unless the ""off"" switch happens to randomly kick in. The ""on"" switches work properly, which of course, serves no purpose without functioning ""off"" switches. The dial does not light up. I have no idea whether the clock timer on it is accurate or not since I would need functioning switches to make that determination. I would love to know if there are any similar products out there which actually work as advertised."
2,Not very reliable.,"We bought this to turn the lights on and off for our bearded dragon tank. Unfortunately, it doesn't really do it reliably, so we have to check on it pretty much every day. Oddly enough, it doesn't reliably turn them off at night, but not back on again in the morning. We've reset it multiple times to no avail. This is fine when we're home, but obviously becomes a problem when we go away for a weekend or longer vacation. We still have yet to find a timer like this that meets our needs and is reliable."
4,"simple, robust deisgn",it doesn't get much easier than this. for the price this provides the perfect timer for those seasonal activities that we all wish something was on a timer for.
1,way out of date.,This book was 10 years old! Way out of date long before appliances like stainless steel etc.etc. Flipped through it and them through it in the garbage.
3,Only three DeMarco Sisters are Pictured on the CD Cover,"The five ladies pictured on this collection of DeMarco Sisters' recordings are not all DeMarco Sisters. The two women pictured on the top row on screen left and middle are Bobbi (Allen) Storm, and Julie Stone. Ms. Stone was a temporary replacement and was not heard on any recordings by the DeMarcos. Bobbi Storm sang lead for the last year that the act was together (as a quartet), and was heard on only one record (2 sides). The song, ""We're Five Little Misses,"" was actually recorded by the quartet. Words and music to the song, ""Time Didn't Change a Thing,"" was penned by Anne DeMarco who retained the rights to the song and passed those rights to her daughter, Lisa. To this day, neither the late Anne DeMarco, or Lisa have ever received any royalties for the use of the song, including the sale of that song on the album advertised here.Rick Saphire Celebrity ManagementRepresenting Lisa DeMarco Brandi[...]"
5,Great Book for Exploring Madrid,"We just returned from our trip to Madrid and this book was fantastic. My sister is abroad there and my family members have all gotten different guides for their visits, but I have now loaned out both copies I had of this guide, because they found it to be much better than theirs. It has great breakdowns of the areas of Madrid and maps that are all cross-referenced. It also includes a section on Toledo that we found to be very helpful on our day trip there. We were very pleased with this purchase."
2,Intimidor spot 2.0,"Not satisfied with the light at all. They are very noisy, so they are not so good for smaller stage situations, and I have 4 of them, and every single one has a plastic part internally attached to the main lamp wires that has melted. I have had to replace this part by stripping the wires and using wire nuts. They are a constant headache.Could be useful in some situations and if your somehow able to avoid the maintenance problems. Intels are essentially a robot in an oven, So spend the extra money for the quality and avoid the headaches. (I highly recommend elektralight)"
1,unbelievibly horrible.,"bad lyrics in every song. i do NOT reccommend this album to ANYONE, just bad, bad-stuff-lovers.p.s. it's just too bad they had to mix the great, just absolutely great music in informant with bad, just absolutely bad lyrics. it's just too bad!"
3,Western Civilization: A Breif History 5th ed.,"I thought the sescription said ""very good condition"" or ""like new"", but there is excessive highlighting and pen marks in the beginning of the book."
4,Typical easy Taylor,"Typical Taylor. Easy and laid back. There are no songs that really grab you or would be hits on prop radio stations. Just James Taylor the way it's meant to be, individual songs that blend together for a complete CD. I never bother to learn the names to his songs. Just plug it in and enjoy the complete works instead of focusing on individual songs. If you like Taylor, you'll like this album."
5,"Less hair,but that the same rich voice","My brother introduced me to James Taylor when I was twelve.He owned every album, but I wore out ""JT"". October Road is James Taylor's best effort since ""JT"" and is just as top quality. His voice and sincere song writing have emerged from his turmultious life stronger than ever."
5,Well worth waiting 5 years for,"James Taylor is back, and not just in the sense that this is his first album in 5 years. If the music on this album is any sign, the man who brought us classics like Sweet Baby James, Flag and JT hasn't gone away, he's just been taking a break. Wonderful arrangements and harmonies throughout, each song is a a gem in its own right and some, like Belfast to Boston and My Traveling Star had me listening to them over and over again, just for that warm feeling that a truly soulful tune can bring. When he begins his tour this autumn, you can bet I'll be at one of his shows just to hear this album live."
5,JT at his finest!,"Listener's will discover that JT put his very heart and soul into this album. Taylor and his collaboraters successfully kept his Folk/Pop/Jazzy style while at the same time incorporating many other influences. This album will be of special interest to jazz lovers, and especially to true JT fans. The spiritual messages in this album are truly uplifting. I feel that this album is one of his best. This is one of those albums that all ages will enjoy listening to from beginning to end. The chameleon JT wears many hats, incorporating folk, jazz, swing, and Carribean influences into this fabulous album that will impress even the most skeptical listener."
3,"Not as good as ""Hourglass"" but do buy the limited edition","Being a very big James Taylor fan, I was looking forward to this new release. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold up to his previous work. Sure, the classic JT days are gone, but ""Hourglass"" was an incredible album, from beginning to end. There are only 4 or 5 noteworthy songs on the ""October Road"" cd, but the 3 bonus songs that are contained on the 2nd disc of the ""Limited Edition"" are worth it, especially the awesome tune ""Sailing To Philadelphia"" a duet with Dire Straits guitarist Mark Knopfler. ""October Road"" starts out strong, but in the middle it can put you to sleep. ""Whenever You're Ready"" just flat out annoys me and ""Mean Old Man"" is a bit [weak]. But hey, I did buy it :) I'm a fan so it's still worth having."
2,Too something.....,"I am a huge JT fan, but I also do not like much of his new stuff. If you want a real JT record get any of his first three (self-titled, sweet baby james, or mudslide slim) and you will see how ""whimpy"" JT has gotten. I was 25 when I started listening to the cd & felt like 65 by the time I was done. The magic from the old stuff is gone & has been replaced by slick producing & too many harps & backing muscians. The start of the change for the worse in JT can be seen just from listening to the changes he made on ""Carolina On My Mind"" & ""Something In The Way She Moves"" for his greatest hits record & then hearing the originals on his self-titled debut (which are much better). If you really like JT's old stuff you may not like ""October Road"" but if ""Hourglass"" is your cup of tea, you'll probably love it."
2,no hourglass repeat here folks...just the old JT tunes,"Really nothing to speak of here. I was disappointed artistically and sonically. Just an extension of the old JT songwriting style and tradition. But JT still writes better songs than I do, so, in that respect, this CD is a good background music for a Sunday barbeque or when your cleaning the bathroom."
2,"JT, you let me down","Perhaps I am missing something here, but what I hear on JT's ""October Road"" is dissapointing and boring to say the least. Far from his best works, it appears that he is trying too hard and the music doesn't seem like a natural fit. The constant back ups were an enormous distraction, and a Christmas song? I can barely tolerate those in December! Oh well,....maybe next time!"
2,"So Ordinary, So disappointed",I have been waiting for this release for a long while. This sounds soooo ordinary and I expected so much more from Mr. Taylor. This sounds like older music with new titles. The arrangements are even similar. I hope others will read this and not be similarly disappointed. There is nothing new about this new release.
1,Nothing Can Replace The Classic Songs,"The newly released CD, ""October Road,"" seems to show that James Taylor is losing his creative touch. There is nothing new on this album. All of the songs sound the same, and, it also seems like they where all written in less than five minutes. If you're interested in hearing good, classic James Taylor music, buy ""The Best Of James Taylor."" I personally think ""The Best Of..."" is James Taylor's greatest CD so far. Whoever compiled that CD has great taste and did a good job. By the way, when ""Hourglass"" came out back in 1997, I thought it [wasn't good]. It's great compared to ""October Road."""
3,December Road?,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! Slick middle-aged crisis stuff. Nothing like the James of yesteryear. Cool tracks somewhere in there but ...James seems to have become a yuppie songwriter/performer these days. With a ""holy host"" of absolutely fabulous songs to his credit, I'd like to see him lose his Brooks Brothers' image, put on a pair of faded jeans, a tattered T-shirt, a baseball cap on backwards, sit on a stool alone and play all those great old non-hit tunes (that are really hits to be perfectly honest), that really express what his true fans love about him.Why ""grow old"" just because the world says you have to?! Come on James baby!"
3,Stephen Hurren from London (UK),"This album is what I would call James' auto-biographical. And there only some of the songs on there that I like: which are""On The Fourth of July"", ""Raised Up Family"", ""Carry Me On My Way"", ""Caroline I See You"" and of course his version of ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"". But I definitely dislike ""September Grass"", ""Whenever You're Ready"" and ""Belfast To Boston"". ""Mean Old Man"" isn't tuneful enough: considering I can cope with this one at the moment. But apart from that, I do think of the information on that song about him being a slight difficult person to live with quite interesting for other people.Because I don't think many other people can imagine having that kind of attitude. Neither can I."
4,It grows on you,"Confessed Huge JT fan. First impression was disappointment. Felt almost like a voyeur to his intimate tributes to his wife. Kept playing CD ... can't stop. Heart wrenching melodies, beautiful harmonies, each song grows on you. Its almost as though JT has put out a body of work which asks the listener to take a journey whose reward is the journey itself. While there are a few cuts which immediately hook, the true enjoyment is found in discovering, days after listening, a chord or verse stuck in your head, an invitation to once again play the CD and discover its magic. If only he didn't have that pesky wife.... my dreams have been squashed!!!"
4,Classic James Taylor,"At first listen, I'm not sure it's on a par with Hourglass, but it certainly compares. The songs are longer and ""jam out"" a lot more, which is a very good thing. There is more guitar, fewer imposing backing vocals but sweeter harmonies all the same and the whole thing is very, very understated. There are a couple of ropey tracks, like Mean Old Man and Belfast to Boston, but some absolute stunners like September Grass and Raised Up Family. But it's a grower, definitely. JT's voice just keeps getting better and songs more sincere. A must-have for fans both old and new."
2,Alas...JT's in love again. 5 stars actually.......................,"How does he do it? Simply amazing. Wonderful songs and as usual, a couple that will bring you to your knees."
5,Outstanding CD,"On first listen, I was surprised to hear non-traditional JT songs like ""Belfast to Boston"" and ""Mean Old Man"". Simply put, the traditional JT stuff is JT at his best. The non-traditional stuff, after a few times 'round, is just as good! An CD you can listen to from beginning to end, over and over."
2,Wrong Turn on October Road,"I love James Taylor. Bought all his albums, re-bought the CD's of the same albums. Listening to October Road however made me wish the elevator doors would open so I could escape. A mellow tune here and there is great but a whole CD of meeelllloooowww was a bit too much for me. I kept waiting for something, anything up-tempo, but to no avail. The great voice, great phrasing, great guitar are all there but little else. I haven't given up totally on JT. I'll probably buy his next CD and give him one more chance. If it's another Perry Como with guitar snoozer I'll just have to savor the old Sweet Baby James and assume he's lost it."
2,Mundane Road,"""October Road"" is another continuation of Taylor's style of his recent albums(insignificant). Maybe after approximately 30 years in the recording business, you do start to run out of songs and settle into a familiar pattern/style. I still have hope that Taylor can recapture some of the superb songwriting and guitar playing quality not really heard since his masterpiece ""JT."""
2,Not your normal JT,"I'm not one for long analytical reviews, so I'll get right to the point.The songs are form the most part low, indistinct downers. The experimental sounds, the lack of any uplifting or toe-tapping material makes listening to this CD a pretty disappointing experience.Take a listen to any other CD (as I write this I play his last live set), then listen to October Road.I just hope we don't have to wait another 5 years for him to make something fun and enjoyable to listen to.Also, I was kind of expecting and hoping for some reference to 9/11, just a little bit of JTs unique interpretation of the feelings so many of us shared. I got the sense he was deliberately avoiding it."
1,BORING!,"I like James Taylor and Ive really like his later records. Im also put off by the sound of a lot of new records becuse they sound so brittle and this Cd promised a lot being recorded in a barn and just people playing together but theres absolutely nothing new, nothing inventive or interesting. If you like JT just the way he is then youll probably like it but I just found that after several plays I just couldnt maintain any interest. His music is too comfortable and lacing some fire. Try the new Jackson Browne Cd, its really great."
3,"Great artist and nice tracks, but devoid of emotion","I got the impression that all of these tracks were recorded in one sitting in rushed environment. Or maybe this was just an ""off"" day. The music and the voice are beautiful, but they just don't convey any emotion or feeling. It feels too ""sanitary"" to me. Even the sound engineering lacks the ""lush"" feel that this type of music should express."
1,"No, this is not Classic James Taylor","The first time I listened I was bored. So, I tried again the next day, thinking it must have been my mood. I was bored again.Spend your money on some other music. JT has not put much effort into this album. It saddens me."
3,"Nice, But Not A Classic","This is a nice album, easy on the ears, but not a classic. I keep wishing for another ""JT"" or ""New Moon Shine"" or ""That's Why I'm Here."" But, lately we get ""Hourglass"" and ""October Road.""Highlight of ""October Road"" for me is the excellent ""Belfast to Boston,"" calling for an end to support for the terror and fighting in Northern Ireland.I will see JT for the third time when he comes to Oklahoma in December, and I will love it I am sure. Please don't get me wrong--even an ""average"" James Taylor album is better than the dreck most artists put out these days.Thanks, JT."
4,Great CD for true fans,"I really liked this CD. But honestly, in my opinion, it's not as strong as Hourglass. It's still quite good though. Regular fans of JT will probably like it. September Grass is greatness. I have to agree with one of the other reviewers, that the addition of ""Have yourself a merry little Christmas"" was a disappointment. A JT album is something I listen to year-round from start to finish. Frankly, I have no interest in hearing a Christmas classic in August. It's a nice song, but maybe he should just make a Christmas album - I'd buy that.Hey, far be it from me to criticize James Taylor - as far as I'm concerned, he can do no wrong. I hope we don't have to wait as long for his next group of songs - they are always a treat."
5,A CD THAT ACTUALLY TAKES CHANCES,"This CD is one of the most exciting and bold CDs released recently. Rather than resting on his laurels and releasing yet another bland, straight-ahead, take-no-chances jazz record, Wertico actually tries to do something different on this release. The music is intense, exciting, challenging, and original. Yes, some of it is ugly...but some is beautiful as well. The range of tone, emotion, style, and energy on this album is something to behold. If more jazz artists had the courage to release music this striking, the music world would be a much more interesting place. This is music of joy and open minds."
4,ELECTROGRAVITY MADE EASY!,"I first read this book back in the early 80's as I was beginning to research electrogravity(gravity & electricity united). This book was a layman's answer to some puzzling questions! Unfortunately I lost the book in 1982 and I am ordering a new one to add to my collection of classics! If you ever heard about Electro-Gravity, order this book!"
2,Interesting but doubtful,"This book begins promising. It highlights flaws inherent in science's current understanding of gravity, and outlines the method that the book will disprove these shakey beliefs. However it barely does this, and instead makes for a slow and rather bizarre read"
3,Interesting and opinionated view of international business.,"Here is a book that isn't afraid to be opinionated. The author provides a unique outlook on a variety of issues related to international business. The author has obviously ""been there, done that"" and he shares his insights with the reader."
1,LOWER PRICE ELSE WHERE,"I juat happen to look up betty boop tattoos, and found this book on linr. I thought i would enjoy reading it, so I decided to do comparison shopping. Boy, am I glad I did. I found this book for $14.95 at random house. Now Why is his book so much here!!"
3,Classics,This movie is really great.B.K. Adarsh made excellent drama film in 1963.In one word : enjoy it.
5,Love You is a goofy masterpiece,"Love You is a smart album for smart people.The vocals are not the smooth, angelic grace that most people associate with the Beach Boys. Instead, the are just rocking! And they are warm and human and a little rough around the edges. Give it a couple of listens, and you'll be hooked. The songs are goofy and strange, yes, but they rock. They are also sweet and infectious. How can anybody not like ""Mona,"" for example? Or ""Good Time""?My girlfriend Penny, she's kind of skinny, and so she needs her falsies on. She don't like cookin', but she's so good lookin', I miss her when she's gone.And when she gets to dancin', I feel just like romancin', especially when we're dancing close. she'll do the dirty boogie, and that's when I go up in smoke.I mean, come on! This is a great tune on a great album. Loosen up, listen to Love You and groove on!"
4,Love You is really good. and I'm not a weirdo,"Okay. I'm not one of those who think everything Brian ever did is great. Plenty of Beach Boys stuff is junk, some Brian Wilson solo stuff is pretty bad. But Love You alone is enough reason to buy this. It is pretty neat music, VERY VERY weird lyrics, very weird subject matter, combined into sometimes very fun and sometimes rather disturbing songs. No, it's really fun. And very weird. Probably the last really good thing Brian did."
3,I'm with Cupid... until the end,"I love the premise of this book. A cynical Cupid narrates a love story as though it's just business as usual. I thought this was a very creative idea and made the book nicely complex. It put a harsh spotlight on the games people play and the masks they wear while searching for a relationship and also demonstrated some of the awful things they do to themselves and the people around them while knowing already that they shouldn't. Most of this was treated lightly and was comical on the surface, but with something darker lurking.I felt that the ending fell apart a little bit though. The last few chapters we lose the story we've been following and focus instead on Cupid talking to other ""spirits"" and instead of just hinting at love lessons, the book starts hitting us over the head with them.Overall, I'd say that I did enjoy this book, but there are many others that I've enjoyed more."
3,Cupid's narrative,"We always picture cupid as a grinning cherubic baby with an arrow. I'm all for love, but having someone who's a baby decide your true love is a frightening concept for me. Thank goodness, the Cupid narrating this story is not a diaper wearing baby. Instead he's a grumpy messenger of love who's made a huge mistake.Anna and Nick are not meant to be each others true loves. Cupid, in a moment of pique shoots Anna with an arrow. What should have been a short relationship turns into a quagmire for Cupid. So how does he get himself out of this mess?Anna was very likable. Nick on the other hand was a an all out horn dog. The changes each character goes through after the arrow strike, is interesting. I liked the message of the book, however I wish the ending was more concise. New elements were added at the end that I don't think were necessary."
2,Maybe it's just not what i'm into,"I got this cd for free because someone, 'slipped' it into my order to promote the band. they sound like evanescence, but with some AFI/misfits implements. they are talented, but it's not that original. if your into stuff like evanescence then you will probobly like it at least a little, but it's isn't anything new"
2,wrong item in picture,I know I should not go by the picture when making a purchase but there were no ingredients in the description to know if this was the plain missing link or the missing link plus. So I did go by the picture that was missing link plus but I received the plain missing link and that is not what I wanted. Very miss-leading!!!!
2,SW433 - Skylight Flasher,The bottom line is that I am disappointed with this purchase... This device is only flashed for 15 seconds and then stop when the alarm system is activated. It is not enough time to alarm for deaf people. It would be helpful and valuable for the deaf people if the device is continues flashing until it is turned off.
1,15-second flasher not worth the shipping costs.,"I purchased this item after speaking to a SmartHome representative that told me it would turn on a light and pass power. However, she failed to tell me that this would only be for 15-seconds of pulsing power, and lead me to believe this feature could be deactivated. This device cannot be programed by the SC100 base unit, and only works with a door sensor or motion sensor. Considering the cost, one would think the unit would be more dynamic. I have communicated with SmartHome about my dissatisfaction, but have not received a reply. Additionally, the unit is recommended to turn on a radio as well, but then again for only 15-seconds of on-and-off power that could possibly ruin such electronics. If you are considering purchasing this unit, take into consideration the above review. 15-seconds may not enough time to help a deaf person that may be asleep, or a blind person even with an alarm attached."
4,Works as described,"Just added this to my current system which is in a large 60x34 building about 60 feet from the house.I needed a way to be be notified when the system was triggered at night while i was asleep,i plugged a lamp with a 100 watt bulb and a radio into the sensor,works great..15 seconds is enough to wake me up to investigate but 30 would be better..hence the 4 stars."
1,Dead Astaire and Ginger,"I adore Fred Astaire and his artful genius. Nobody does it better. Ginger is his best dance-partner, for certain. But this book is the dryest, most boring recitation of dead data that I have ever read. It is almost worthless, even for the most avid Astaire devotee. These two vibrant stars deserve better than this dismal book. And they get it; if you can find, ""Astaire Dancing"" by John Mueller, the ultimate Astaire/Rogers book, (pricey but spectacular) buy it. It is everything the Astaire/Rogers fan could possibly want."
2,What a waste,"As a huge Astaire/Rogers fan I found this book to be nothing more than a collection of over analyzed run-off with a few interesting tidbits thrown in. There's very little entertainment in the reading. One get's the impression this book was authored by Sigmund Freud. Different maybe, but yuck."
4,A Look at Two Careers and Images,"This book is more about the careers and images of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers from 1934-49 than it is a study of their movies together and their dancing. If you are a dance enthusiast and want to read a detailed account of their dances, this is NOT the book for you.However, I am not a dance person, but I like classic Hollywood films, and I found this book interesting. It shows how the Fred&Ginger films share some concerns with screwball comedy, how World War II affected the images of both stars, and how stars age in the public eye. Gallafent isn't the most graceful of writers, and I got confused in his discussion of ""Once Upon a Honeymoon,"" but I thought he did a good job connecting the Fred&Giner phenomenon to other developments and careers in classic Hollywood."
1,Very bad for a talking dictionary,"I was very disappointed when I turned on the dictionary and tried to get the sound for English and French words. The audio portion of the dictionary, which is why it is so expensive, is terrible. The sound is the voice of a machine, maybe the worst out there. I could not understand the English at all. It was not English. I have my a Master's degree in psychology and I am very fluent in both spoken and written English but this machine made me feel stupid. the French section is just as bad. Please do not buy this product for pronounciation because you will be laughed at. The manufracturer needs to invest in getting a real human voice to go through every word in the dictionary otherwise it is a waste of time. Until this kind of investment is possible, leave the audio part out of the picture.Remy,Brooklyn, NY"
4,Lots of fun!,"It's so much fun being able to share with my children a classic show I enjoyed as a child. Even after all these years it's still great to hear quotes like, ""You rang?"" Of course it's hard to get the shows catchy tune out of your head, especially now as my 5 year old walks around the house singing it. The Addams Family is great fun for the whole family."
5,I love that Classic One,"Although I could watch the Adams Family on german TV when I was a child, the Episodes never had been published in my Country, so I decided to buy the Original DVD Box and I still love to watch it. Great!"
5,Just as I remembered it !!!,"I watched Addams Family as a child, here in England, and have always remembered it fondly. When the film versions were released I constantly told my children that the original TV show was far better. I bought this DVD as soon as I saw it was released in the US, and YES my children agree the original is still the best. It has stood the test of time and is still as funny as I remember (unlike some programmes from my childhood that I rushed to buy on DVD only to find that they are very dated and not as amusing as I remember),I have not been disappointed and will definitely be buying future volumes as they are released."
5,good,Great show always funny never dull a show you can watch again and again. This is excellent for enthusiasts and newbies.
5,60's TV American Gothic =The Addams Family,"If LeFanu was a comic writer,then this would be his dream assignment.ABC's 'Addams Family' was one of those great 60's TV Sit-Com shows that bridged the gap between the early 60's into the late 60's.This hilarious off-beat show would not have been aired in the late 50's,because it was too strange and kooky for that gray flannel suited era of American conservatism.And this campy farce would not have made it in the late 60's ,because of the vaudeville silliness that didn't fit in with seriousness of the Vietnam war,racial struggles,Woman's Liberation, and development of real New Age faith-based religions. This was a funny and charming TV series that put a creepy Gothic spin on all the traditional family sit-com shows of the time.So remember to 'Leave it to Pugsley' and that 'Gomez Knows Best'.-Yankee Rose!"
3,comedy horror blended and ...,well ive only red a few reviews its interesting to note the classic differeences between strait doses of strait horror and the difference between added comedy by charles or great charles ...in afls mix an combination of top 10 genres its noted that blended genres makes for educated actors and actresses in the future ... spice an flare deffinitly cause some glare between sad and glad with some black mad ...shdf...
5,A good read,"This was a good read, I only put it down to take care of necessities(grin!). The character personalities and quirks were easy to understand and the whole thing had a GOOD storyline to it. The book was especially interesting to me as I live in the Fauquier County, Virginia area where a majority of the events in this book were based. I just love when a book I'm reading has local ""color"" in it!"
5,Cruisin Music!!!,"I first came upon the Blue Hawaiians as a DJ for WCCX, (Near Milwaukee, Carroll College's independent radio station).The name drew me in, and after the first track I couldn't get enough and ended up playing the entire album the following week!!!After buying the album here on Amazon.com, it has been in regular rotation in my car and in my study lounge on campus...My favorite tracks include: Dick Tracy, Swingin' Hula/Women in Chains, Highlife, and Experiments in Terror.A must-listen for ANYONE who likes songs like Miserlou, Walk Don't Run, or Wipeout, or anyone who likes the Soundtrack to Pulp Fiction!!!"
4,"A good album, but try before you buy","I'd give the compilation three stars if it were not for the nostalgia factor, which is worth the fourth (including a little credit for comprehensiveness).If you are really looking for late 70's punk or even 90's pseudo, punk-wanna-be, this ain't it. Swords of a Thousand Men is a gem, and I'd suspect the most popular single the band ever turned out. (Though, I remember it differently from the 45, which I must dig out and replay as a refresher.) Bath Water, Wunderbar, Four Winds, Love and Food (B side off the Thousand Men single) are all great tracks and there's a solid lineup of songs to back those up.However, I cannot help but feel that some of these tracks verge on British country (and Western?) music; that bothers me. I enjoy the album and expect the laser to wear grooves in it, at which point I'll stick it on the record player. However, I'd hesitate to recommend this album to those who've not heard Tenpole Tudor before.Now . . . where's that 45 . . ..Sean"
1,wrong part listed,"Caused me alot of extra bucks. This sensor fits a 96-97- 1.9 liter Saturn 4cyl. Not the 1997 Chev. as listed. wast of my time and money. The right part is # 13474 and amazon says it will not fit a 1997 chev. 5.7.350, But it does. I wish things were always as listed but they are not. Better always double check the part number."
5,Quality,"Govi has a style and talent that anyone can like. This one and Guitar Odyssey are my favorites although I have not heard every Govi album. Govi is great to have on while studying, reading, or just relaxing after hard work. Enjoy!"
4,Very Good -- if Not Quite Heavenly,"The music on Seventh Heaven is unmistakenly Govi and again very well recorded; clean, full, and with great detail. Two cuts are fast moving, one is medium paced, and the rest are slow and soft, of which two are solo guitar. As the editorial reviewer reports, this music on this CD goes well with a glass (or two)of nice wine. I recommend that Govi fans purchase this CD. However, if you do not already own any of Govi's previous releases, I suggest that you first buy ""Passion & Grace"" and ""Guitar Odyssey"". These are truly outstanding --- Govi at his absolute best. George M -- Phoenix, AZ"
2,Genuine or copy?,"The CD did not look like the original I have, which lists the songs on the CD. It only said ""Govi"" which made me wonder if it is a copy and not an original."
2,Govi with his own bland,"Oh dear, Govi just cannot maintain that wonderful style, achieved on albums such as Sky High, Passion & Grace, Heart of a Gypsy etc. Once his music was to be listened to, now, with seventh heaven, its just background music for dinner parties.I sincerely love the way this man plays guitar but seventh heaven is way too bland for my taste. Shame."
1,Cheaply made piece of junk,I had this shipped to me in Iraq. As light weight as a piece of gear can get. Cheaply made. Completely disapointing and I gave it away. I do not recommend this product. Spend a bit more and get something that is able to be used.
3,Il più commerciale lavoro delle ORME,"Con ""Orme"" il omonimo gruppo di rock italiano firma la sua opera più commerciale. Carenti d'idee, stanchi oramai, si ripetono con testi intelligenti ma musiche scadenti. Parte due del LP ""Venerdì"" (""Biancaneve""). Con questo disco si vede partire il tastierista Tony Pagliuca ed il rientro della band in un lungo silenzio interrotto solo dopo sette anni dal capolavoro ""Il Fiume"". Solo per fanatici delle Orme."
3,Frog Man of Legend,"A man recounts a tale of his childhood when a legendary monster known as Rana by local Native Americans came out of the lake for vengeance.In the end we have been treated to the tale of Rana and now the man will venture into the lake to look for the gold that the natives had offered as tribute to Rana.The creature is a frog man (Rana means frog) and pretty unstoppable. A pretty standard rubber suit creature that works as well as it does by never letting the audience get a good look at it. The writing is about what one would expect from a very low-budget film (I especially liked when the scientist referred to frogs as lizards).In a way, this reminded me of The Legend of Boggy Creek but without the documentary style. But still we had the narrator return to his childhood haunts where he had encountered a monster."
2,ran a way aft quic viz @ end,"just ok or 1.5 stars sorta like movie hydra and both weird, plain, cheap, too long, not enough monsta action. i remem 2 lil monsta scenes before the best part near end when it broke thru house at night w/ frogs in its mouth and that was it vs. the leave u hangin cave scene of eggs at end."
3,preview first,"I suggest you preview this title before you get it, even as free. It has a very archaic structure to the language used and you would really need to enjoy this of type writing. I didn't."
5,Faust and Avenhaus Hit the Spot,"While not a classical musician or scholar, I enjoy music generally, so my comments hopefully will be useful to persons with catholic tastes and who probably enjoy and are exploring the chamber music of, for example, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms.I purchased this album because of the enthusiastic reviews, and listening through high quality headphones, have not been disappointed. Repeated playings continue to satisfy. Naturally, taste is subjective, and there are no guarantees of satisfaction. But, as other reviewers have opined, the recording is superb and the playing excellent."
5,Classic Treatise on Crucifixion,"Translated from German, this is outstanding look at this practice in the ancient world and the cross of Christ.The great reversal of God's Son crucified and this is good news? is a scandal to the natural mind of humankind.Hengel shows these two aspects well, carefully documented his sources from ancient history and Scripture.The theology of the cross vs. that of glory is reflected in this theologian's writing, e.g. ""The heart of the Christian message, which Paul described as the 'word of the cross' (logos tou staurou--transliterating the Greek), ran counter not only to Roman political thinking, but to the whole ethos of religion in ancient times and in particular to the ideas of God held by educated people.""Still true today. This is excellent reference for your shelf, also try and obtain Paul Maier's ""In Fullness of Time,"" and Eric Kiehl's ""The Passion of Our Lord."""
4,EXCELLENT,"Don Nix was a blues rock sessionman not even a stone throw from Delaney and Bonnie or Derik and the Dominos Clapton. He loved that rootsey R&B; that many, like the aforementioned, Leon Russel and even early Rita Coolage were delving into.This is a great country blues R&B; album with the same organic sound mined by the above artists in the early 70s. Not a glimmering stand out, but then again, this music flows so deep in the soul, standout is not the order of the day.Great if you can get it."
5,Great Driving Game,"I love driving games. I love this game, it's easy to play and has lots of variety. There's checkpoint races where you can race against computer opponents, and blitz races where you race against time. It's realistic enough that it's fun to just drive around. Of course, I've only had it a week, but other driving games have bored me in hours. So far, so good.Oh, and make sure you get the patch from Microsoft for running it on Windows XP from here: http://www.microsoft.com/games/midtown/downloads.htmThere's a trial version you can download there that's pretty fun too."
3,finally back on the shelves,"I've had each of these on CD for the past several years, and listening to this new CD I see that there's essentially no difference between this new, double-CD and the two original CD's, released in the early-90's. If you already have these albums on CD, it might be worth buying this CD, if just for the liner notes and to free up space on your shelf.And contrary to what the label says, there are 22 tracks, not 21 tracks. ""Male Ego"" is the 22nd track.As far as I'm concerned, this CD is probably worth getting for die-hard Beach Boys fans, but for the casual fan looking for ""good music"" other than their pre-PetSounds stuff, I'd look to either ""Carl & The Passions / Holland"" or ""Sunflower / Surf's Up.""The 3 stars are for: Keepin' The Summer Alive (the title track), Sunshine, and Where I Belong."
3,The Boys Of Summer,"After the debacles that were M.I.U. and The L.A. Album, the band had nowhere to go but up. While Keepin' The Summer Alive is hardly great, it is a big step up from the prior two albums. The band got back to the harmonies that made them famous and although songs like the title track, ""Sunshine"", ""School Days"", and ""Santa Ana Winds"" are going to make anyone forget their 60's songs, they are enjoyable. The Beach Boys was recorded after a five year layoff and finds Brian Wilson returning to the band yet again. The result is a suprisingly fun album that has one excellent song in ""Getcha Back"". Mr. Wilson provides his best vocal work in years and the song is a throwback to their heydays. Other notable tracks include ""California Calling"", ""She Believes In Me Again"" and ""I Do Love You""."
3,And the hidden track is.........,"The ""hidden"" track on the KTSA/beach boys twofer is actually ""Make Ego"" and has been called a ""hidden track"" because the people involved in putting this twofer together forgot to list the track on the albums liner notes!It was listed on the original album.The highlights of this twofer are ""keepin' the summer alive,oh darlin'(nice Carl Wilson lead vocal)getcha back,it's getting late"" and the ""hidden track"". One disappointment is the appalling backing vocals on ""Santa Ana Winds"".My bootleg(landlocked) has a much better version.Still,a reasonable twofer for collectors with liner notes by Randy Bachman(of Guess Who fame) and Andrew G. Doe."
2,Get the highlights on a compilation,"I only had one of these two albums on vinyl, 1985's ""The Beach Boys"". The lead track, the single ""Getcha Back"" was the best song they'd come up with in the seven years that had passed since the glorious single ""Good Timin'"". The remainder of the album could be disposed of apart from the closing track, ""It's Just A Matter Of Time"". I would recommend downloading both of those and dispensing with the filler that constitutes the rest of that album.I was always tempted to purchase the first of the two albums in this set based on the strength of the title track that garnered some airplay in 1980, ""Keepin' The Summer Alive"". Not a top shelf Beach Boys track but still better than the insipid ""Rock and Roll Music"" and the like. So I've downloaded that one track.Save your change and pick up the Beach Boys'box setwhich includes ""Getcha Back"". Dollar for dollar it's a much better investment."
3,The Beach-Boy's Last Stand,"These are the last Beach Boys albums to feature Brian & Dennis Wilson, although Dennis is virtually non-existant on KTSA and sadly died before BB '85 came out. The undoubted highlight of both albums is Carl Wilson, and Where I Belong is his best song in years. Keepin' The Summer Alive, and It's Gettin' Late are both excellent tracks too. Brian's songs can best be described as not his best, but Goin' On and Male Ego are quite catchy. The production on both albums is not exactly great, and is very much of its time. The 1985 album especially has not aged well as a result. Overall I'd say that this CD is a worthwhile purchase, if only for Carl's songs."
3,Not without their charms,"No BB fan will go to the gallows defending these 1980s efforts, but that doesn't mean we don't have a soft spot in our hearts for them. For me, KTSA was a welcome reprieve from the overblown late 70s bombast that was on the air at the time. The songs are simple confections but in the case of the title track and ""Santa Anna Winds,"" oddly affecting. BB85 is distinguished by Carl Wilson's vocal showcases, particularly on ""It's Getting Late"" (which flirts with R&B) and ""Where I Belong"" (the CD highlight). Those who believe that a BB CD must have at least one great Brian Wilson song to merit purchase won't be buying this one; his presence is an ambivalent and indifferent element indicative of his desire to break from the So-Cal Frankenstein he created. But for those of us who marvel over Carl's inflections, there's plenty here to take pleasure in."
3,Keepin the summer alive/Beach Boys,"This album is pleasent to listen to. Not quite what the Beach Boys have done in the past,but some good tunes to excersize with or take on a bike ride.Title track can get you dancin,Santa Anna Winds is put together well and Goin On has a great harmony.Overall I have to say ,Keepin The Summer Alive is a permanent part of my Beach Boy collection. P Campbell Colorado"
5,Nice presentation,"This is an inspiring collection of short meditations or thoughts from Seat of the Soul. The small spiral bound easel format can be set on a desktop so that new meditations can be displayed on a daily basis. It contains a single lesson on each page with a total of 280 pages. The format is also great for reading in short sessions to review or remind one of the lessons presented in the book. After reading Seat of the Soul, I really enjoyed this collection of short stimulating lessons."
4,All encompassing approach to Life,I have only just started reading this book and I already find it all encompassing.The teaching so far is significant for me and enlightening for my life path.
5,Fantastic for work or play.,"This is an awesome laser pointer. I use it in a manufacturing facility to point out locations to run cable or install equipment near the rafters. The beam is incredibly bright and strong. I have also used it for star-gazing and it appears to touch the star. However, it is not the best for use in PowerPoint presentations. The beam is so bright it hurts the eyes at close distance and completely takes the focus off of the presentation. Other than that, I've had it for 4 months and still going strong on the Toshiba batteries that were included (with regular use)."
4,Samael's latest installation is another masterpiece,"4 out of 5, it's not phenom, but it's a lot better than most critics have said. If you liked ""Passage"" (and who wouldn't) you're going to like this as well. The remastered older tracks and new style unreleased ones make an excellent mix. A sure winner in my book."
2,i didn't like it,"i dunno, i just didn't like this cd. i bought it today, listened to it, and wasn't happy. what i didn't like is the techno beats. what are they thinking? techno beats shouldn't be allowed in metal. i wouldn't even call this black metal. so i returned it, and got blood ritual. i'm glad i did."
1,(A-teens) gimme gimme,Hola friends(Amigos) I'am from chile....de la segunda region (Antofagasta) les quiero pedir un favor si UD. me mandarian el cd-single de gimme-gimme (A-teens) aca lo recargan a mi cuenta..please.
3,My problem is with the pealing paint on the fire hose.,"I cannot in good conscious recommend this product to parents because of led paint concerns. The car is made in China (of course) and it has these two hoses on the side, every time the hose is removed, paint peels off. There is no way to stop the peeling unless the hose is removed. Other than the paint I think it's a really cool fire truck."
1,Doesn't work,"Although it's somewhat intuitive if your a technophile, it didn't come with instructions. Set the jumper to 720p, attached it to my PC/Media Center DVI out port and plugged in the component cables (attached to my HDTV). Could never got a picture..."
3,better off just to clean the water,I don't notice any difference with this stuff. It arrived quickly. I don't notice a difference in my betta's bowl when I use it.
4,"This is the fine antecedent to both ""Species"" and ""Contact"".","For it's day, 1960's, it is quite thoughtful, full of accurate science and yet is good story telling and involving science fiction."
5,amazing,"I loved it. Life changing.after reading this book I experienced more and more the protection and help of the angels.Especially, Archangel Michael and Archangel Rafael.Thank you, thank you, thank you."
5,Inspirational,If you love Angel books you will love this book. I find it very soothing in times of confusion or crisis. It is a wonderful book to keep by your bedside and pick up on a quiet evening.It is another great way to add to your spirituality.
5,The first of many books I own by Dr. Vritue,This was the first book I read from Doreen and it has become a great reference source in my practice as an angel messenger. The angels have guided Doreen to write a book we can all understand and receive claity from....how wonderful. This is a must read if you are on a spiritual path....keep it by your bedside as a reference guide. Blessings....
4,Fun,My 5 year old son is into slime and all that gross stuff and loved this. He was excited to see what dinos he got. Definately would be too messy for anyone younger than 5.
4,Tar Pits gift,"I bought this item for my great-nephew, on the advice of a friend. I have only one adult child, and no grandchildren, so I was rather flying ""blind"" in choosing it. As far as I know, he (my nephew) likes it."
4,An excellent Afro Latin flavored CD to start your collection.,"Own this CD if you enjoy an outdoor cocktail on warm evenings. If have ever wanted to bring back some memories of your last vacation in Latin America or Miami, this is your soundtrack."
3,A Mixed Bag!,"This Nirvana release is a mixed bag of oddities, rarities and outtakes. Obviously this means that the CD may appear pretty uneven, and admittedly it took me quite some time to discover that it's actually a pretty strong release.Some very interesting narration tracks by Patrick Campbell Lyons on Guy Stevens, Salvador Dali and Jimmy Cliff. Especially the track in Guy Stevens is moving and very memorable.There is a fine rare Smoke recording of ""Girl in the Park"", one of the best Smoke recordings I have heard.Many fine Nirvana compostions such as the alternate versions of ""Rainbow Chaser"" and ""Tiny Goddess"" ""Crazy Hotel"" ( with vocals reminding me of Jim Morrison ) and ""We Can Make it Through""."
4,Jerry Fielding Big Band,Fielding did not get the recognition he richly deserved - this band really swings and there is very fine personnel!
2,Not as good as the first.,"Okay, so we knew how this was going to end before we started it. Ending aside, this book felt like Peter Gethers had been pushed to write something he really didn't want to write. The stories about him and Janis are getting repetitive, and the ""final adventures"" of a dying cat that take 1/2 the book just don't hold interest for that long. If you're someone who just **has** to finish what you start it's not terrible, but I wish I'd have stopped at #2."
4,The joy of Norton!,"All three of the Norton books are just fabulous - if you are a cat person, you have to read them! However, as you'd expect, this last one is a heart wrencher. Cats are amazing animals and Peter Gethers captures the personality and joy through his telling of his adventures with Norton - truly a treasure!"
5,Great Book!,"I've waited with great anticipation for this book. I've been a Norton fan since the first book. I wasn't disappointed. All the books made me laugh out loud, this one made me cry too. Norton (and Peter)fans will want to read his final adventures, but have the Kleenex ready, you'll need them."
1,The worst yet,"A Hallmark card disguised as a book. If you like your cliches syrupy, I guess you might like this drivel."
5,Peter Gethers is amazing,"I was given the first two Norton books as a gift. A Cat in Paris, and A Cat Abroad. What I discovered is the magic of Peter Gethers. My friends, these are more than just ""cat books"". Peter Gethers is an a gifted writer who writes about his interesting life, and the adventures Norton has with him. This book is the final Chapter of Norton stories. It's a heart-wrenching story of the final adventures of the friends we've known to love, whether abroad or home. Our rough around the edges Peter has no boundaries when it comes to sweet Norton. One thing that has always stuck with me is Gethers, a grown man, who would move over in bed so as not to disturb Norton sleeping on his pillow. It's painful to read, especially if you've read the others. But, Gethers brings us to Norton's end in peace. It's a great book for an animal lover, but Gether's adventures make this book a fit for anyone."
5,wish this cat could live forever,"I was anxious to read this book-i had read ofthe author's love for his cat and heard a few funny stories. Perhaps because I am in animal rescue that I found this story to ring true and filled with compassion and understanding. I lved it-it will a family treasure,read a couple of times a year. The story touches the heart.I held back the tearsup to a point.Read it!"
3,Some good songs here!,Good songs on the CD. Good sound quality. Was a little disappointed that there weren't more well known songs.
4,Very creative,"I've had this CD for years now, and I keep hearing new elements I hadn't heard before. This is not your run-of-the-mill metalcore.Before Tim Lambesis reformed As I Lay Dying he helped write most of this album, and you can hear his influence. Very catchy licks, heavy coruses and intricate verses make this a standout album."
2,its okay,"i like society's finest. i just liked them more a year ago when i saw them play at cornerstone for the first time. the new album is good hardcore, just nothing suprising. i still support the guys anyway."
1,ROUTER TABLE,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM BECAUSE OF PRICE, I DO PRO WOODWORKING AND THIS ISNT MADE FOR ANY PRCISION WORK IT IS SO FLIMSY THAT I CANT USE IT AT ALL AND IT DOES NOT HAVE A USABLE FENCE. I AM DISAPOINTED AT THIS COMPANY FOR SELLING THIS PRODUCT SINCE ALL THAT I HAVE BOUGHT OF THIS BRAND BEFORE WAS GOOD QUALITY, SORRY THUMBS DOWN"
5,Treasure,"Awesome little book. Very helpful for the person who is starting a small business, great passages to better one self in many different are areas. Helps you know why others think and act the way they do. It put a lot of things into perspective and explaned many actions and reactions of other people. Every business owner, boss, manager and parent should have a copy of this."
5,1789 was a great year!,"The piano trios on these CD are not so well known, and this is certainly *without* justification. Just for example, the trio no. 14 has a middle slow movement which is not less than sublime. The melody in the violin is one of the great revelations of the classical period (sorry for the superlative, but it fits!). The whole piece is full of Haydn's invention and is a typical example for his style in the years 1787-1790, which brought many masterpieces like the Oxford symphony and the ""razor"" quartet. The balance of the recording is excellent, like in all the other volumes of this highly recommended CPO series, performed by Trio 1790."
5,Sldoke,Great gift for any wine lover. Got this one for my girlfriends birthday in May. Going to add a few ribbons and bows....what a perfect gift. Love it!!!
3,Not as big as I thought,I was looking for one of those giant glasses like on Cougertown for mothers day but this will have to work for now.
1,Tacky,I don't think this is a bit tacky. I prefer the galss that holds a bottle of champagne. That's much classier.XL Giant Champagne Glass (Holds 24 oz)
2,Are you kidding?,"Why not just drink out of the bottle? :P If you want it aerated, just pour it in a bowl, and use a funnel to pour it back!"
1,Flimsy packaging = glass puzzle,The vendor is optimistic that a flimsy plastic package that flexes will be enough to hold the glass in place. I was hoping the other reviews had spurred a repackaging but instead I received a two piece wine glass. The stem had snapped plus there was the bonus of some glass chips where the base and the bowl had collided. Amazon's box was fine and padded. The vendor's package was not thought out for shipping.
3,Love Big Carl,But he arrived broken. Imagine the despair to such a wonderful almost friend. Drinking wine to the second death of Carl.
2,"Is what it says, not too impressed (also arrived shattered)","Was going to give this to my sister as a gift. Came packaged well, but the glass inside was shattered. The glass used seems too thin for its size. Ended up buying a different glass (that holds ~2.5 bottles) from a crafts store for about half the cost, similar toOversized Wine Glass Cork Holder"
4,Gift for Christmas,I searched all of Amazon and the internet.. Was hoping this would make it here by Christmas and it did.. and came in ONE PIECE... I was really worried about it breaking...Hopefully it lives up to actually holding a whole bottle of wine... I give it 4 stars because I don't know if it works yet.. and two.. the packaging scared the hell out of me.. since it was in a larger box with crappy plastic bubbles that didn't help.. and then in a smaller box with bubble wrap!
3,too heavy,"This product, which already weighs 2.5 pounds, is simply too heavy for my toddler to deliver to mommy when filled with an entire bottle of Rose'. :("
5,The backyard astronomer,"Who knew I needed a Barlow lens? These people did, and I'm learning a lot more. Good information, written for the novice (like me) and perfect when I'm thinking ahead to what I want to look for."
5,Excellent astronomy reading thru Amazon,Very descriptive easy readable book about Astronomy by the expert of the kind Terence Dickinson. I think this is the best astronomy book in the market. Updated sections of the book can be read online in their site. Excellent!
5,Excellent Reference,"Although the material is a few years old, it is still one of the best guides for the novice. I highly recommend it."
5,Backyard Astronomer's Guide,"Very nice hardcover book on many aspects of astronomy from beginners to ""old timers"". If you are considering astronomy as a hobby this is the book for you. It goes into great detail on all types of telescopes and what they are best suited for plus background information on the scopes I never would have thought of. Beautiful photos too."
2,overrated,"Gotta admit, I was very disappointed with this book. If you don't own any astronomy books and want a good primer, this is ok. Before you buy it, you may want to just check it out from the library and see what you think. Fairly expensive for what you get. I didn't see it as a ready reference. I'd recommend the spiral bound version of Nightwatch for beginners instead."
4,A wonderful introduction to all aspects of astronomy.,"I picked up this book to learn about astronomy, because I knew very little at the time. This book is a great resource for those people who know next to nothing and want to learn a lot more about everything. Terence Dickinson's book provide information for all aspects of stargazing. Everything from picking and purchasing the right telescope or binocular and accessories, to introductory nighttime viewing under various conditions, with even some information on more advanced astronomical activities, such as astrophotography, are all covered in an easy to read, informative format. A great read for anyone wanting to break into the hobby, and a great reference for those with unanswered questions. Highly recommended."
5,Best Book There Is,This is the most complete book for amatuer astronomers. I have read many good books on the subject and have a decent library but The Backyard Astronomer takes first place. Many interesting facts and bits of information are found nowhere else besides the complete knowledge on the subject and its equipment.
5,A comfort and joy to the beginning astronomer!,"The ""Guide"" takes the complexity out of sky gazing by allowing the beginner to sort through the latest equipment and jargon. I feel much more confident and prepared to enjoy this new hobby with the help of the Guide. The reading level supports the beginner.The pictures are an inspiration."
5,A very nice book,Great book with really nice pictures in it. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what those stars are up above their heads.
4,Extremely useful and easy to read,"I'm a novice amateur astronomer who bought this book as a reference. When it arrived, I found myself reading every page, cover to cover. Whoa! Turns out to be much more than a reference after all. The authors aren't afraid to go out on a limb and <gasp> give their opinions, not just the facts. They cover every topic a novice would need, and do it in such a way as to make the reading extremely interesting. I can honestly say that this book has heightened my excitement about getting into amateur astronomy and I now feel well prepared to do so.Even if you aren't a ""serious"" hobbyist, buy this book if you buy nothing else on the subject."
3,Nightwatch is better than this dated tome.,"Nightwatch, by the same author, is better introductory reading. The Backyard Astronomer's Guide contains more detailed material, but it is very dated. The layout resembles a 70's highschool textbook. All photos are black and white. First published almost ten years ago, the book's telescope reviews deal very lightly with some of the newer technology.The book also lacks the excitement and immediacy of Dickinson's Nightwatch."
4,Beware - looks like a textbook,"I read all the reviews on this book and purchased it, but it was not what I had in mind. I was looking for a book on stargazing with the naked eye and picking out formations and general knowledge and lore about stars. This book was much more intense and thorough (equipment and photgraphing). Not a bad thing, just an fyi. If you are looking for a quick and easy guide, this may be more than you bargained for."
4,"Biscuits, Pancakes and Quick Breads","I got this book out of the library and decided I needed to own a copy. Great recipes for mixes that will serve as bisquick and allow you to have homemade biscuits and pancakes quickly and easily. The author also gives you additional recipes to use the mixes for. Beautiful pictures of the recipes, which is a must for me. I think it is a great addition to my cookbook collection."
1,Not worth the purchase,"This item must have been on the shelf too long. When I tried to rub the letters onto a sheet, part of the letters transferred and part of them stayed on the original sheet. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,Britney is a Sweetheart!,"This book and DVD are just... Amazing. It hard to explain, but when you read the book, you get this feeling of solitude and sadness for Britney. But that feeling only comes harder with the DVD, which is what tops this documentary off. She is followed through her time in Mexico, while there, she's asked personal questions, and is told to do strange things by the media. Then a stage disaster devastates her final show, and she has to make a decision between continuing the show, or calling it quits, seeing as she could be risking her physical safety.This book is visually amazing, the layout is beautiful, and it comes off as the view off Britney from he media (or Britney in a picture).But when you watch the DVD, which gives you a complete look at her everyday life, takes away that sunny image, and replaces it with a world where Britney has over worked herself, and is tired. But she still keeps her smile. If you want a front seat look at what real fame is, you will love Stages..."
4,Great Book/DVD for a personal look,"This was great because it was a really personal look at her life. She is such a sweetheart and shines in the DVD. Now I feel really sorry for the way all the critics bashed her ""dash"" from Mexico City. You need this!"
3,Decent movie,Love anything with Ed Norton. I liked most of the movie but felt it went over the top at the end.
3,"Okay movie in great series. Saw them all, and this one is at bottom of list.",This movie is at the bottom of the movies in the prequels for AVENGERS. Ed norton does not appear again as banner.
4,Not quite on it,"I think Hulk is awesome, I just really dig the desperation. And the thing I like about this movie is Edward Norton. But also he's pretty much the only great thing about the movie. It's not a boring and bad movie, it's just that it's not as satisfying (story-wise) as the first one with Eric Bana, who I think was just a wrong actor."
3,Weakest Entry in the First Six,"While technically well-done and an enjoyable one to watch, this is probably the weakest entry in the six prequels to Marvel's The Avengers. I think the movie is well cast and that it does it's job in establishing the Hulk's place in the Marvel universe (though much better than Ang Lee's attempt). Especially Edward Norton does a good job as Banner. Overall it's a movie worth owning..."
4,Incredibly Better Than The First One,"I was on the fence about purchasing this movie because the first Hulk movie was so bad. I decided to buy it anyway because of Ed Norton and I was happy that I did. It was awesome! Way better than the first. Action packed and great special effects. I hope there is another one. If you like super hero movies, you won't be disappointed."
2,Waiting for the extended cut,"I won't be purchasing ths DVD until they release it as an extended cut. The theatrical release felt as though 45 minutes of plot was missing!They just moved from Hulk Smash scene to Hulk Smash scene and didn't give time for any the characters to develop into anything the audience could care about. Basically the producers provided the complete opposite of the 2003 film, when they should have just looked for a happy medium.Hopefully Marvel Studios will give the fans a more complete version someday, possibly Ed Norton's original cut, just like they did with Daredevil-presenting a movie that is actually watchable."
2,Way Weak,"This movie, which I believe is supposed to be a sequel to the first starring Eric Bana, is weak. The creature doesn't have any of the ""attributes"" of the Eric Bana version like, he grows larger and stronger when made more angry, his leaping ability is cut way down in terms of distance. I mean, what the hell did they even make this flick for if they were gonna change aspects like those that basically ""define"" the creature's fury from the beginning. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the Tim Roth character steals the show from Edward Norton's weak display."
4,Hulk Review,Hulk dvd did not give Hulk enough talking lines. I expected more. The Hulk character is 5 stars awesome. Not the right kind of action or enough.The Hulk does have some human side and should show some intelligence of the science person having control at times. If the story line and adventure parts had something more it would help.
4,"""The Hulk Movie to add to Your Collection.""","If you are a true Hulk fan, buy this blu-ray dvd and add it to your collection. Edward Norton's performance was second only to the late Bill Bixby's portrayal of Dr. Banner."
4,Good movie,Great movie.. a must see Rent it you won't be sorry if your a fan of the hulk.. and even if your not!
2,Blah,"There are better comic-book character to movie adaptions out there. This was not one of them. Even with modern technology, the Hulk came off as cartoonish."
3,Just fun,"Pure fun and all action, as I expected. =)I enjoyed the plot, the execution, and of course, ""Hulk smash!""If you want to brush up on your green ""Avengers"" hero, this is the best version of Hulk to see. =)"
4,okay movie,I Watched the movie. I'm glad I saw it and just as glad I didn't buy it. It is a one time movie
3,The incredible hulk,"It's good for the kind of movie it is. The hulk should have been the same from the avengers, but Ed Norton is a great actor so it's ok."
5,The New Incredible Hulk Rocks,This new take on the Hulk is in every way superior to that piece of crap Ang Lee put together.
3,It was okay?,"I wanted to like it, and, I suppose it wasn't a *bad* movie, it just wasn't a *good* one either. It was just kinda there.As for the screening experience, I watched it through Amazon's player, and the graphics weren't much more than decent."
3,Enjoyable enough but not great,"This is quite a fun film but slow paced. It could have done with a lot less messing about, but the ending is worth watching.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
1,Not HD,"I thought this movie would be in high def. considering we are in 2012, you would all movies would be in HD."
1,DIGITAL CODE EXPIRED,Warning..these older movies include an expired digital code. I bought this mainly for the digital version for my iPad. Code did not work and I tried to get an updated code with no luck. Emailed Amazon customer service and they approved and emailed me a return mailing label. So I assumed I would get a full refund. When I got an invoice for a pitiful $2 credit because they charged me for postage and restocking fee I was extremely upset. I am a long time Amazon Prime user and this was very disappointing. They should have told me that they would charge me for the postage and restocking fee. IF they had I would have just kept the DVD! Buyer beware if you want the digital copy and shame on Amazon for not honoring a full refund.
1,blu ray dvd,took long.not in origanal blu ray dvd box and only one dvd usually blu ray dvds come whith 2 dvds will never buy from here again
2,As Mindless as the Monster Himself...,"Plotless, pointless and pedantic, the new reboot of Marvel's jade-jawed giant is as mindless as their monster.Featuring a far wimpier (and less agile) Hulk then the first installment, this worthless romp was clearly crafted to bridge the synaptic clefts of children.Bottom Line: fast-paced fodder for adolescents and adults with bad to average tastes."
3,"Lots of cgi but still an enjoyable, if long, movie","I have to say I enjoyed this Hulk movie up until the last fight sequence - which seemed to drag on and on and made me hit the fast forward button through sections of it without feeling I lost anything by it. I had to smile at the homage references to the Hulk TV series. The opening section of the movie in the Brazilian slums was a nice touch - it was certainly a different setting for a movie like this.For me in many ways it was the final scenes of this movie that were the most interesting, and if you enjoyed Iron Man you should pick up this movie for that alone. I've given this review three stars because of the over-extended fight sequence at the end of it (shades of Spider Man 3!) and the cgi which disappointed me a little as they seem to have relied on it to make up for the lack of character relationships (one of the highlights of the TV series), but if there is a sequel to this movie I'll watch it on DVD if nothing else."
4,Hulktastic,"I thought this was a very enjoyable movie. The ties to the Marvel/Avengers universe were a lot of fun. Also, those who complained about Banner's seemingly new ability to control his hulk-outs in The Avengers should do their freaking homework and watch this movie first."
3,Probably One of the Weaker Ones,Okay movie. One of the weaker super hero movies if that is possible for the hulk but tried to watch it three times before I actually stayed awake to watch it all the way through
5,HULK SMASH!!,OH YEA!!! HULK SMASH!!! SMASH SMASH SMASH!! WHAT?! I SAID HULK SMASH!!!! ALL YA'LL GONNA GET SMASHED LIKE POTATOES!!!!! HULK!!!!
3,One of the lesser Marvel Avenger movies,"1) every Hulk has a different actor - frustrating.2) story line is a little thinIf you just want to watch Hulk Smash, great movie."
4,HULK,I liked this movie very much. Exspecially the way it has been tied in with Iron Man1 & 2 Thor and Captain America in perparations for the movie the avengers
4,Amazing and amusing,"An awesome thrill ride with just a touch of well placed humor. If you are a fan of the Marvel genre, this one is a must have!"
3,Mediocre story & so-so special effects,Where is the leaping ability of the Hulk? This movie adaptation pays too much homage to the de-powered TV version of the character.
4,This is more like it,"Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" was, to say the least, misguided, dull, overly cerebral, and disappointing. This one (which basically ignores the original film) is MUCH more faithful to the comic book and the classic television series. Yes, the dialogue is a bit stilted, but this is a comic book movie, what did you expect? The story moves along quickly, there is an underlying sadness to Bruce Banner's dilemma, the special effects are well done, the final battle is satisfying...overall, a solid effort and I do hope they eventually do a sequel (I know they are doing ""The Avengers"" next, but a Hulk sequel would be appreciated as well). I only gave it 4 stars because this movie is NOT the revelation that ""Iron Man"" was...this is more of your standard superhero movie, but again, reasonably well done."
2,"Great movie, messed up security device",I loved this movie in theaters and waited this long to buy it. I knew I wanted the three disc set with the itunes copy. I have the dark knight digital copy and i find it really rewarding to have my favorite movies on demand at my desktop.The download for this digital copy expired mere weeks before I bought it in november of 2009.I emailed Universal home video but have gotten no response.I was gypped.
4,Digital Copy is Expired,"With regard to the movie itself, I thought it was an excellent movie. I even repurchased it on Blue Ray after already owning it on DVD.My review is specific to the blue ray disc product being sold, not the movie. Unfortunately the digital copy that came with The Incredible Hulk on Blue Ray was expired before the movie was even purchased."
4,"The Hulk, as incredible as his creators intended","Finally, this is the Incredible Hulk as he was seen in the comic books since the early 1960's. I had forgotten how much fun the Hulk could be. The Hulk is one of Marvel's creations that are equal parts superhero, horror, and sci-fi fantasy. This character's story borrows as much from Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and King Kong as it does from earlier superheroes. The battle between the Hulk and the Abomination is reminescent of ""War of the Gargantuas"". Loaded with escapist action and adventure ""The Incredible Hulk"" also reminds us that humankind is responsible for the wonders and the horrors that we have wrought."
4,A Great Super Hero Release!!!,Well. I have to say this release matched my expectations. The movie itself is pretty cool. I should by honest about it: this is one of the best quality images I've ever seen in a Blu-Ray release. It's a shame the content is not as good as Iron Man's but it still good.The Incredible Hulk delivers the goods and I'm sure we'll see a Director's Cut in a near future!Enjoy it!
4,much better than the earlier installment a few years ago,although movie making technology hasn't helped much to improve the look and feel of the Hulk since the first installment a few years ago (still looking like a graphic cartoon) however the plot this time around is far better than the first movie. The ending also makes the audience on their toes in anticipation of what the film makers are insinuating of a new film that may be features the Avengers.
2,TIVO OWNERS BEWARE,"For some reason, TIVO owners don't get wide screen for this movie... WHY???? It's boxed all the way around, so the movie is 1/2 the size of your screen :-("
2,Good movie... semi-bad copy,"Ok... bought this BD of the hulk a long time ago as i'm a big fan of the hulk. wanted a BD copy for my collection and i guess it doesn't help to procrastinate because I finally watched it and 3/4 through the movie, it begins freezing and won't go any further. can't return it now because it's been waaaaay past the return time and so i'm just kind of stuck with an almost working BD. oh well.... i guess it is what it is. next time for sure though, will put it in right away but you live and you learn."
5,The Incredible Hulk and all My Amazon purchases,I got this movie for my son as a gift and he loves it. I received everything that I ordered from Amazon in a timely manner. I enjoy shopping on this site and will continue in the future. Amazon is the best place to shop.
1,reeking stench of derivativeness,"I'll probably get slammed for writing anything like this, but I can only hope that someone will be spared the agony of watching this. This movie is terrible, derivative dreck that from the very beginning looks like everyone involved was only in it for the paycheck. I have never shut off a movie so quickly in my life."
2,not so good...,"well, the first THE HULK from some years before is real bad....the story is uninspired, and the film is confuse and silly....well, it's hard to make a movie with a green giant monster that destroy everything and can't speak rational words....this one, THE INCREDIBLE HULK is a little better than THE HULK, but still is not so good...These HULK movies got amazing visual effects, but got uninspired dialogues, characters and story...."
1,Digital Copy,"Although the movie and blu ray is great, the digital copy has was provided without a redeem code. This means I paid for something I actually didn't get."
2,Great Special Effect...HOWEVER,Anyone who has any kind of a memory should have been disappointed if they just went to see Ironman and then followed it up with the Hulk. Did anyone else notice similarities? The writers for instance? Or Stan Lee? We just had David vs. Goliath in Ironman with little Ironman against big copy iron man. Why did we need to see it again with puny Hulk against bigger hulking thing? Seems repetitive to the extreme. I can only hope that the Next Avengers introduction movie (THOR maybe?) isn't small hero against large copy look alike villain with all the same powers. Let's see something new that I can't think up.
2,horrible streaming,I have watched a lot of shows off amazon but the streaming on this was really choppy. Checked our internet and everything great on our end. But we only saw about half the show because it kept stopping.
1,????,"The movie is awesome, the picture is great. The reason why I gave one star is the audio. It is either 2 channel stereo or 7.1 Absolutely no surround sound with a 5.1 system. Renders this purchase a complete waste of money"
5,Much better,Much better than the first two Hulk movies. Why didn't they keep the guy who played the Hulk here for the Avenger Movie?
4,Hulk Smash?,"This was one of the first movies I saw on Blu Ray. I had the movie on DVD at the time and for comparison purposes wanted to see if there was really much of a difference. YES. There is. The colors pop a lot more and The Incedible Hulk is a great movie to utilize not only the visual side of things as it pertains to a Blu Ray, but also the sound side of things. The Incredble Hulk is one of my favorite Super Hero movies of all time and I was so pleased that the Blu Ray was solid in it's presentation of the film. If you're on the fence about picking up this title on Blu Ray...come down...just get it...you'll be pleased."
4,Edge of your Seat Entertainment,"The Incredible Hulk was extremely well casted with Edward Norton as the 'Hulk'. Although it was difficult to imagine Ed Norton in this role, I think he did a fabulous job. We also enjoyed the morphasis of the 'Hulk', which was more realistic than the original series. Incredible special effects and genuine great acting!"
5,New and Improved HULK!,"By far this version of The Incredible Hulk is head and shoulders above the 2003 Ang Lee's flop. The CGI is superb more realistic in comparison to the fluorescent green Hulk in the previous version. Just take a look at Hulks detailed deffinition in his muscles and body structure, very cool. I truly enjoyed this film the action is incredible, the special effects are amazing. I am glad that Marvel is producing their own movies, you can see the difference in the story telling and the overall quality. I am now looking forward for every new Marvel movie that is soon to come out. You just know that this in going to be a sequel since their was a guest appearance from Stark/Iron Man, I can't wait."
4,Decent movie,"Several attempts have been made to portray the Hulk in the movies.This latest is a good effort with a decent story and characters you can root for if not identify with.However, If you are looking for Shakespeare, or a great cinematic event you will be disappointed.After all, this is a story based on a comic book reflecting the inner rage of the teen years."
5,Good but not great,THis movie is good but not a great one in the the Avenger series. I think that Mark G. did a much better job as the Hulk. THis was packed well and arrived on time.
3,the Hulk movie,"Most of the movie is okay, I think the Hulk character however is kind of cartoonish and not nearly as well done as the character is in the Avengers."
5,Da Hulk is cool,I just loved this movie! I liked the Hulk so much in The Avengers went and bought this to catch the beginnings so to speak and was pleasantly surprised.
3,Decent movie,Ok movie bought it to get ready for avengers. It's not as good as some of the other marvel features though
4,My boys really liked it.,This was well done. One small part needed fast forwarded because of sexual content but besides that it was pretty good.
4,The Incredible Hulk,After seeing both Hulk movies I do prefer this newer one to the earlier offering. The actor portraying the Hulk (Norton) I feel fits the role much better. Norton has an intensity that the former actor (Bana) lacked. I'm also glad that this movie did away with the divided screen comic book style which the earlier film relied heavily on. Liv Tyler is every bit as good in the role of the former love of the Hulk's as Connelly was in the earlier film. I'm also relieved that the storyline doesn't include one similar to the Nolte/ Bana in the former film. Every time Nolte was on the screen I felt he took the film in a strange direction and sucked the air right out of it. It brought the whole movie down with it. One thing that this film does do is that it doesn't replace the former film in that the storyline picks up where the other Hulk left off. Anyone who enjoyed the 1st film will like that aspect. This movie I can stand to watch again several more times.
3,The Incredible Hulk,"Okay this was better then the T.V. show and the last ""Movie"" attempt with the HULK. A good story line but as for the casting of the villain (Tim Roth) it is just not believable! It's like pitting Rocky against Woody Allen, instead of Dolf Lundgren, who is much more imposing and believable! I know your saying ""Believable?"" this is a comic book movie!(example; Micky Rourke in Ironman) And I have to say that William Hurt is William HURT! in this, with is bland monotone flat line performance he kills his character. So ONE STAR for the writing. ONE STAR for Ed Norton and Liv Tyler and ONE STAR for the FX's!"
2,came up short,Love this movie loved the cool break away package however I rate this a 2 because the digital copy that came with the movie expired 2 years ago. I contacted universal and even they would not give me a code that would let me use digital copy. Feel like I didn't get what I paid for.
3,"IIf you saw The Avengers first, don't expect the same Hulk","I was disappointed. I've seen all of the recent movies in the Avenger series including Captain America, Thor, the Iron Man movies, and this one just seemed out of step with the others."
3,a decent sci-fi movie with...,"... some great action scenes (my favourites? the fight on the campus and above all, the transformation of Banner/Norton into Hulk in doctor Stern's laboratory... that last scene is really a great sci-fi moment). I should add to this that the special effects are really awesome too. The acting? Not bad at all but i agree that Edward Norton is under-used... Tim Roth is really convincing in the role of the bad guy and William Hurt is credible as the general Ross... Liv Tyler isn't that bad as Betty Ross...The directing is classical and not very innovative but still entertaining and breath-taking. Melodrama is reduced to the minimum and the hulk is often really scary... Letterier was obviously focused on a 95% ""in your face"" action-oriented pack and the Incredible Hulk is just that.My notation? 3,5 stars..."
5,hulk review,Great movie! better than the one they made with eric banna edward nortan carried the movie but the extras could have been better.
2,Completely Unrealistic,This film has a variety of scenes which are completely far-fetched and unrealistic. I can't believe that a human being could be capable of throwing tanks to-and-fro. I can't get into a movie which I can't believe in. Overall: C+.
1,Digital Copy advertised - EXPIRED 3 years ago,"BEWARE - though this is advertised a a ""THREE-DISC SPECIAL EDITION"" the digital copy activation code expired 10/31/2009. NOT WORTH THE PRICE without the digital copy. Disappointed with Amazon for not policing this more closely."
5,The Hulk,"Hi,First with Amazon's prime would cost $8.98; $6.99 + $1.99 handling, but is free, and usually get a day or 2 early than the typical Tuesday release date. The $79 a year is pretty fair and even better on books $12.99 total. Blu Ray from Netflix is hit or miss. So for hot titles I usually buy them.This version of the Hulk was very entertaining and more compassionate then the orginal. Pretty fair price and typically cheaper if it is preroder! The price is usually slightly better than say WalMart, if they have it at all, especially on the release date."
4,Pretty good movie,Disappointed Norton didn't reprise his role in the Avengers. Pretty good movie. Very good delivery and prompt. It is better than the first Hulk they made. Have seen both.
4,"great movie, but",should have a digital copy with it. The movies itself is great but buying just a blu-ray movie now a days is a waist of money.
5,Great movie...,"Again, when my wife is happy, I am happy... I get my wife all the MARVEL movies when they come out. She is a serious MARVEL fan."
5,AWESOME!!!,This movie is simply AWESOME!!! It looks amazing on blu ray. The digital copy is a great bonus to play on iPod.
5,Awesome movie,"It doesn't matter if you like comic books or not, you will love this movie. It is an action packed thrill ride!"
3,Blu ray copy I had Colors were'nt up to par,"I purchased this at Wal mart and when I viewed it on my blu ray player I was surprised that the colors weren't vivid, they looked dull (might have been my disc). The movie was good, but I was extremely disappointed with the color on a blu ray disc compared to my others."
5,Great movie!,"Much better than the first. They don't do the stupid thing with 5 scenes on 1 screen. The acting is better, and so is all the action. Not to mention the hulk looks much better. A must see!!!"
3,"OK, at the end","Stark shows up and tells the general that they're putting a team together and at that point I now get that that team is The Avengers movie that plays into that one but if the Hulk is in another country after he defeated that other monster at the end of the Hulk when the Hulk jumped off the building and into the sky then why didn't they portray that tie in into the Avengers movie, after I saw the Avengers movie it didn't make that much sense because the Hulk was in with the team and the storyline sort of fell apart. So are they planning another Hulk movie to explain his further exploits after that point and is Ed Norton going to reprise his role in it? The incredible Hulk didn't have that much of a role in the Avengers movie.This is why I give this only 3 stars."
1,No Digital Copy Despite pic showing it.,"So why would you sell the game ""New"" if someone clearly opened it and took the digital copy and put a poor excuse for plastic wrapping on it? Should've just bought it at target. Jokes on me I guess."
1,Bonus dvd not working and amazon is doing nothing about it!!,"Bought this bluray and its perfect except for the dvd bonus where I'm asked to input the serial code in order for computer / ipod playback.apparently there was an error and i cannot register hence the dvd-rom was useless, emailed amazon and till now its been more than a month there is not reply from them!!!I'm terribly disappointed by the service provided by amazon!!"
1,S.O.S!! over and over and over and over again!!!,"Let me keep this simple. I watched this film because myfriends LOVE this movie.Come to think of it, if you give my friends a 'box of staples' anda six pack of cheap beer, they'll stay amused for hours.Need I say more?"
1,The Incredible Hulk DVD,"i cannot 'review' this item as the vendor, 'products of the lost planet', never completed this transaction, nor did they make any effort to advise as to the status of same after four separate inquiries..am now awaiting 'approval' for a refund from this vendor, and have reordered this title through an alternate vendor - one that i have ordered/received titles from in the past and have demonstrated professional and prompt service..."
3,The Green Machine,"There is not some reworking of the comic book character, so the movie is focused on action scenes which truly capture this unique super hero in fist-throwing romps. Actor and co-screenwriter Edward Norton portrays Bruce Banner in a way to push things to the computer-generated - and highly cartoonish - Incredible Hulk, who clearly is the star.Without a complicated backstory and rapid pace - though it may have too much of a video game feel for some - the battles of the Incredible Hulk are...well, incredible; especially when the military futilely throws all types of gadgetry at the large one. This emerging franchise has mapped out a solid plan to become a successful second-tier hit in the future summers of super heroes on the large screen."
5,great movie,"I really liked this movie a lot and i am very glad that is finally out for preorder. I wish i could have afforded the 3 disc, but hey i just want the movie."
3,"Mindless, entertaining fun",My kid is superhero obsessed and requested this. I ended up watching it as he ran around the house instead. I'd forgotten how much fun a simple action flick could be on a Saturday afternoon when it's too cold to go outside.
5,Awesome,"It's probably not the best of the Marvel cinematic universe, but there's something inherently fun about the Hulk smashing the hell out of stuff. I enjoy it."
4,Best iteration yet,"Although this francise of Marvel comic has never been my favorite, this is the best version yet - thanks to Ed Norton."
4,Great movie! Excellent quality,"This is my first Bluray movie. Comparing it with my old DVD movies I must to admit the difference in video quality is noticeable. In the case of sound, perhaps I didn't get a big difference comparing with DVD.It's a good action movie, I believe it's better as Ang Lee's version."
3,much better than expected,"I had very low expectations for another ""Hulk"" movie, after the Ang Lee disaster, ""The Incredible Hulk"". I was surprised that this wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. Edward Norton is not bad as the weakling bruce banner and Liv Tyler is actually pretty good actress in this. There were even a few times when I was scared. The main problem I think is that the Tim Roth bad guy hideous character was too contrived to keep the story believable, but whatever it's a comic book so who gives a damn."
3,Ok but...,"The movie was good, no question there, though clearly not one of the better movies from hte Marvel universe. Ed Norton as the Hulk was good, too bad they lost him for the Avengers. Now, on to the produect review. This came with a Digital Copy disc, no code to activate it. That's really annoying. No, it wasn't listed as Blu-Ray+Digital copy, but clearly it was at one point. that means that either it originally had no code, or someone opened it, and took the code out. It was listed as new, not previously used or previously opened."
2,Waste of Time,"This movie was not only boring, but was a waste of time. I rented it because first of all, it is a lesbian movie. Next, because the character MAX from ""L Word"" was in it. I was thoroughly disappointed. I guess if you are totally bored and have seen every other lesbian movie out there, you could waste a Tuesday night for almost 2 hours, but I definitely would not recommend it. It is cheesy, and almost too stereo-typical. The ""almost"" funniest part is when the main character writes on the bathroom wall at her place of employment that ""men put chemicals in tampons to make you bleed more, so that you will have to buy more tampons"". How ridiculous."
1,awful,this movie is craptastic. the story is weak. the characters are hollow. and it misrepresents so much of the community. there is nothing redeeming about this movie
2,Could have done better,"Bunched feminism up into some simple angst ridden ball, when it is so much more complex. Includes some annoying stereotypes. Blah w/e it could have been better."
3,Perfect Gift for an Ex!,This movie is pretty much the brainchild of a group of friends' weedbrownie experiment gone wrong. We've got all of the components of an interesting film: Lesbian terrorism. Love Story. Semi-mainstream lesbian actors.I bought this to watch with the girl i was seeing at the time. It is one of the few things I didn't ask to have back after the breakup.
4,Amazing movie :),"This was an amazing movie. Unlike all of the outgoing lead characters in most LGBT movies, the lead in this movie is a quiet girl who has a hard time speaking up for herself. During the movie, she gains empowerment. As soon as I saw Jamie Babbit's name in the credits I knew that there was a high probability of the movie being great and I definitely was not disappointed. There were some things about the plot that I would change. But as a whole, I still loved the film and look forward to seeing it again."
3,Disc quality,"The quality of the disc was excellent. I cleaned the disc and let her rip. Story line, predictiable"
2,So predictable and very insulting,"Please save your money it is not worth purchasing. This movie was an embarrassment to feminists and lesbians alike, and to think this movie was suppose to be from the same producers and writers who made But I'm a Cheerleader and swore this was better writing than that movie were telling a bad joke. It does though have cameos from a few of the actors from But I'm a Cheerleader, nonetheless, this movie was nothing-if not less funny. Not to mention it insulted my intelligence."
1,Waste of time and money,By far one of the worst films I have ever seen.....Claire of the Moon was equal in being a boring film. Wasted film media in my opinion.
2,I am not sure what to say,This movie did not keep my attention. I did not see the purpose in making this film.
1,Itty bitty titty committee,This was a horrible movie! I can not believe I sat all the way through it (I was hoping it would get better...IT DIDN'T. Save your money and get something else
4,5 STARS! Rise against the system!,"In this coming of age story, a young lesbian learns how to rise against the system and defy everything she's learned about what it means to be a woman.Who best to create a movie about women than a female director? Jamie Babbit, who has worked on ""Alias,"" ""The L Word"" and ""Nip/Tuck,"" helps the audience see America for the male-dominated society that it is. If SLC Punk! were to meet If These Walls Could Talk 2, the end result would be Itty Bitty Titty Committee. Don't let the star characters' small breasts fool you. Their balls are enormous!"
4,Itty Bitty Titty Committee,"A fun film with familiar faces.I love that the conversation at the dinner table is not around the fact that the leads is a lez, but that she's no longer going out with her girlfriend, that mom loved; a nice change. Daniela Sea and Jenny Shimizu make apperences in this lightly political fun film. Cudos to the women in Hollywood making films for the ladies!"
5,"Light Hearted, Educational and Imaginative","My kids (ages 4 and 2) love Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, and love to watch this DVD over and over. I don't mind them watching it because it is educational and Maggie is very imaginative. The DVD teaches manners and how to make believe. I recommend this DVD it is light hearted, no violence, absolutely nothing in it that a child shouldn't see."
5,"Unreal product "" Super Boot""","I used these boots in New Zealand on various hikes/ climbs. They never let me down. (mud/rain/rocks) Numerous other hikers wanted to know where I got these wonderful boots. A word to the wise, don't want too long to get them resoled, and sent it back to the company to have the work done at a very reasonable rate. I tried to have these great boots resoled at a local shoe maker and well, I am know buying another pair, due to him messing them up. Anyway great pair of boots."
2,Something Wrong Here!,"There is definitely something wrong here. These Danner Boots are supposed to be made here in the USA, but they fit like something that is made overseas. The pair of boots that I received initially were actually a half size too big, so I returned them for a smaller size and the length of the those boots was perfect. I took the time to size the boots properly because I haven't had a quality pair of boots since wearing Matterhorns. Unfortunately, there was no ""snug"" fit at the rear of the boots and they slipped while I walked.The first thing that is noticeable on a poorly made pair of boots is that the rear of the boots slip when sized properly.Either there was a bad run of these at the factory, or Danner is ""pulling a fast one!"" - WLK"
4,complex and beautiful,"This is an absolutely fantastic compilation of melodies by two of the world's best musicians. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I prefer instrumental-only melodies over those with vocals. Samples on Amazon don't include the vocals and reviews here do not indicate vocals, and there are many."
5,Best hot chocolate ever,got the product fast. Was very pleased. Gave them to family. They thought they were great too. I do this every year. They can't live without this hot chocolate.
5,Best hot chocolate ever,It's is the best brand for hot chocolate. I had bought a can in Utah and took it home to Texas and when we ran out just bought the Nestlé brand because our stores here don't carry Stephens. I was amazed at how watered down the Nestlé brand tasted compared to Stephens. I will never go back. We have also tried the mint chocolate flavor and the candy cane and both were excellent.
5,Im crying over it!,I can't say enough good things about your NO ADDED SUGAR Milk Chocolate cocoa. I just cannot find it any more.THE NAVY Commissary DID CARRY IT BUT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED. Thank you in advance for any help.I am Diabetic and this is the first cocoa I have found that is not loaded with sugar and sodium.Nancy Beeler
5,The best Hot Chocolate on Earth,"I purchased this for my sisters christmas present, we liked it so much I had to order again to have at my house. It is a luxuorous chacolate, superior to anything else I can find."
2,Overrated,"I had never heard of Stephen's and was excited to see the great reviews. Unfortunately, the target audience of one, who drinks hot choc daily, didn't particularly like this variety, so I now have six cans of the stuff guaranteed to last for a long, long time."
2,I hear there is an 8th Season - is this true?,I hear there was an 8th season - can you add anything to this rumor?
4,An Oldie but Goodie,"Picture It! is an old software used for calendars, cards, etc. (Desktop Publishing). We had this at home till my husband broke the CD. We looked into different models of calendar making software, but none of them is as flexible as Picture It- for example calendars can be stretched to be in whatever shape you want them to be. My husband likes printing calendars in landscape, so he can write more detail in each block of the calendar. We were excited to see that this was still available at Amazon! Thanks, Amazon!"
4,A good path to management,Challenging ideas is always the hard way - but it seems to be the only way forward when moving in an unknown environment. That's why I found this book very convenient for people who want to get into business management.
2,"Reader's Digest, not a textbook.","I was amazed that so many filler words could add up to only 100 pages. Poorly structured. The examples are fine if you have a photographic memory, otherwise it requires rereading entire paragraphs just to identify the points the authors are trying to make. The book could have been summarized with bulletpoints in less than 10 pages."
1,NOT SO GOOD....,"This book contains so many unuseful things. When I took the exam, it had totally different things I never found from this book. And there were some print out mistakes with in the book. And it's got confusing way of organizing topics."
2,Consider the Barren's one,"I bought this book because I read the five-star reviews and I thought it would really help me do well on the SAT II: Physics subject test. I bought this book last year and I did not regret until I have taken the test in October. The lessons in the book were unclear, the problems were way too easy, I ran out of time on the actual test and got a 710. It's not very satisfying. If you really want to ace the test, consider barrens, harder but better."
1,This book is embarrasing,This book is not what you want for reveiwing for the SAT II Physics test. It attempts to make the subject material seem easy and ends up over simplifying most of it. Many of the practice test's questions are flawed and have conflicting answers in the answer keys. The second practice test has almost nothing to do with the material discussed in the book. I got a 760 on the first test and a 610 on the second. Do not buy this book.
2,Cutting corners,"Really, if you want to buy this book I'd suggest you buy the AP Physics Review published by Princeton Review instead. Why? Because its the SAME thing! The only difference is that they took out the Physics C-level stuff and scarped out all the free response questions. All the multiple choice are the same, and so are the review material (from the diagrams to the explaination)."
4,"Could be better, but not too bad.","The review book is clearly organized and cover many of the topics which are presented on the exam. The practice tests aren't an eact model of what you'll see on the real exam, but many of the questions and similar and I found the practice tests useful. The only real disadvantage to this book is that it is a bit too simplistic. The SAT II covers topics into greater detail as well as some more difficult topics not discussed thoroughly in the book. However, physics is a difficult subject to review because of its magnititude. All in all, the book isn't bad. I would recommend that you use this as your review book, but even better yet, use it in conjunction from a review book by a different company."
1,"Physics students beware, this book is bogus","Princeton Review's book is riddled with errors, some subtle, some almost humorous in their absurdity. This book is guaranteed to mislead the budding physics student into a false sense of security. It is also likely to fill their heads with half-baked notions and incorrect thinking, some so agregious as to be patently incorrect. The real test is likely to be a real shocker, particularly when the grades come back.Avoid this book, except as a last resort, look instead at the many other fine books from other authors/publishers."
3,Overall good game with a few setbacks,"I enjoyed the game with exception to a few glitches. The only time on career mode that the manager let me throw a complete game was when I was close to throwing a perfect game. There were times when the manager pulled me with 1 out left in the game and a shutout was still intact. You can question the decision but the common response was that he saw that I was tiring or that sometimes he says that he should have left me in longer, but the bottom line is your player/pitcher gets pulled, having it impossible to complete some goals such as getting complete games, etc... Then there are times when the fielders double clutch, resulting in what should be errors but the computer always gives them hits, which goes against your player/pitcher's avg. against.With exception to those glitches, I enjoy the hitting, pitching and fielding aspects of the game."
4,1 year later and I'm still happy!,I get a lot of compliments on this laptop bag. It is durable and pretty and has made it through several dozen airports with me over the last year.
1,"29 Days to a Smooth Move, Review","29 Days to a Smooth Move could be helpful if it were up-to-date and dealt with issues it says it will. However, the book is too simple, perhaps designed for a select audience who have never moved. For anyone with moving experience, this book serves too little helpful information. If you need detailed, advanced, timeful moving advice, this is NOT the book for you. For generalized, extremely basic information, it might be helpful."
5,"""29 Days: 2nd Edition"", makes me want to move... again!","This second edition of ""29 Days"" is even better than the first. It contains more information and has been repackaged in an easier-to-use format and size.The book's practical yet clever suggestions make moving simple. The budgeting section is especially helpful in keeping the spending under control. It also kept me organized with lists and ""important date"" reminders. This really is a great book for the person in charge of a household move. I wouldn't move without it!"
4,Neat,"My teenage son received this for Christmas as a speaker source for his ipod. He is happy with it, it's fun and pretty cool. I wonder if the price is a little high but all ipod speaker systems seem too high priced for me anyway. It is a fun novelty and the speakers seem pretty good, not for the serious sound seeker I don't believe, but I am no expert in speakers."
1,Not Recommended,"Cheaply made is the best phrase to describe this item. Received one as a gift and like other people who reviewed it, the speakers worked but the globe did not. The globe would light up when touched but that was about it. The speakers themselves were poor quality. I had it hooked up to my PC and the cheap $12 speakers on my desk provided better sound quality by far. I attempted to contact the support department at DreamGear (the 1-800 number is a recording telling you to send an e-mail). It took a day to get a response which consisted of ""Make sure the unit is plugged in and the globe inserted into the base"". A follow up e-mail to my response took 6 days and requested I send the globe to their office for replacement however no tracking number or RMA was provided....no thanks."
4,Saw Them Perform Live...,"Went to the Creepy Crawl in St Louis to see this band. Of the four bands that played, this was the one I enjoyed the most. I took the ear plugs out for them! A month later I heard one of their songs on an internet radio station, recognized it, looked at the playlist to see who it was, and what do you know? It was Squad Five-O, within thirty minutes I had ordered their cd online. I have listened to this cd several times and still like it. There isn't much Christian related lyrics in here, but a couple of songs seemed geared towards Christian ideas."
4,Good...but in hindsight...it could have been better.,"Yes. that's right. In talking to Jeff, he himself said that they were dissapointed with the way this record turned out. Yes, i will attest that it is an extremely good record. It definetely lived up to the expectations of Fight The System (though some would disagree)...but it was definetely a different turn. Earlier on, their records were skunk (ska-punk) records and this one was a total turnaround which record the glam acts of the 70's and 80's. It's a great record, but these songs are pulled off much faster live. The main complaint i've heard people make about this record is that it's much slower than the live versions and certain demos that can be found on various comps..."
4,Bombs over Broadway,"Gotta tell ya honestly, this cd is total glam rock. When the band first started, it was totally about the whole punk rock/ska genre without horns, but they've melted into their current sound, changed their looks and their style, and pull off a 'guns and roses'-esque kind of cd here. Revoloution anthems sung with the 80's glam passion and the head-rocking beats. Being a fan of that style of music, i give the album 4 starts, but if youre looking for punk again like their first album, look elsewhere."
5,Another great book by Cameron Dokey.,"Heart's Desire was another great book by Cameron Dokey. It combined romance, suspense, and a bit of horror. Jeanine is an ordinary teenage girl who buys an Egyptian pendant at a second hand store one rainy day. On a class trip to the museum, the pendant awakens a young Egyptian man, who during the time of the Middle Kingdom, was cursed by an unfaithful lover. Jeanine is determined to deal with this situation practically - until she finds herself falling in love with him. I highly reccomend this book to teens who like horror and romance stories."
1,A RIP-OFF!!!,"The starting was interesting enough, as well as the storyline, but the author doesn't seem to know what he wants to write about. The story is mapped out horribly, and the characters have no character. A sore disappointment. Cameron Dokey should find another job"
5,Barnes does it again,"This is exactly what I want in a collection - stories and essays by a great author. I really enjoyed it, and reccomend it to anyone who likes Barnes' novels, or just well written SF.I found in reading this book that the author has both a BA-Economics and an MA-Political Science, math-intensive. This explains much about his well planned worlds and scholarly characters, but there is so much more here than that. Buy it. Read it. Understand why he's compared to Heinlein so often."
4,Barnes' short stories are even better than his novels,"I came to John Barnes' writing through his novels, and was very pleasantly suprised to find his short stories. They pack almost as much creativity as is usually found in a 300 page work into a scant 30 pages. The downside to this, of course, is that after being so drawn in to one of his universes, you want to stay with the world and the characters for another 270 pages...One great thing about this collection are the essays interleaved between the stories. The insight into how Barnes arrives at his plots and universes is a special treat."
2,Great retailer; not so great product.,"Delivery from retailer was fine, but the product was a disappointment. Doesn't work very well and doesn't hold up to an 8-year-olds' handling."
2,A good book and well written but,The tutorials and examples are nothing to write home about. Anyone experimenting with trueSpace can create the same characters in a few days. It's still a good book but it doesn't really cover high end type work. Ok for a beginner.
2,A VERY,"The beginning was very interesting. It was about two people who have been attracted to each other for some time, but were afraid to show it until they were paired together at a wedding. However, they are broken apart by the lies of another woman. The situation was resolved too quickly to be believable."
4,The Wonder of the Wit,"This is a great CD for your next road trip. I especially enjoy Dorothy Parker's poem ""Men."" Her scathing delivery is hilarious. Ogden Nash, with his deliberate and self-indulgent style, may strike a listener as tedious at first. But just listen, and the reason for his easy arrogance unfolds within your mind as his assonance and rhyme build through imagery and punchlines to a certain sublime truth about this life, whoever you are, wherever you are. I've listened to several of these poems over and over. Phyllis McGinley is more stark and political than Ogden and Dorothy, and her delivery far less nuanced. I'm not sure why she was included in this collection; it may have been polished off nicely with a better choice. I can't really blame her, though--who can follow Ogden Nash?"
2,A Not So Thorough Camera Guide,"McBroom's Bluebook is a disappointmeny for me. Most of the info is available in currrent photo magazines. There simply is very little information on vintage cameras. For example; Zeiss, one of the very greatest lens and camera manufacturers, rates one page and one camera model. This book merely skims the surface and spends far too much space on contemporary cameras for which information is available from other readily available sources. Sorry, I'm not happy with it."
1,Misleading title: NOT UP TO DATE,"As one reviewer notes, this book is now in print 7 years, which makes it somewhat older than that given the time taken for preparation and publishing.Some of the information is useful. But the cameras that were new way back then are not new now. Used film camera prices vary according to collectability, usability for those who choose to use film at least on occasion, and sometimes for no good reason. But there's no connection to anything that was true when this book was published.Digital cameras are largely replacing film, like it or not. A book published about higher end digital cameras today would be largely out of date in 18 months and incomplete well before that.The primary value of this book is that it's almost a historical short book on the value of cameras that one author considered worthwhile in 1999-2000. It gives you a picture of reasonable camera outfits. Otherwise, virtually useless."
3,"Good story, fun gameplay, and ok visuals... but outdated","I had fun and that's the main point. Combat is pretty bad with the Wii remote but not impossible to learn, but the stealth attacks are great fun to watch and perform. A few glitches and the visuals look like Xbox, which isn't bad, but could be a LOT better."
4,BEST GAME EVER just one little problem,"like i said BEST GAME EVER even though there is a problem that occassionally gets annoying, its the camera veiw. every time you move the wii remote even if its just a little the camera veiw will change. but other than that the game boils down to a jerk that wants imortality by stealing your girlfreinds power which kills her and you get pretty darn mad and go after him to kill him. thats as far as i got so far but youll love it after the first few minuts you play it. trust me."
2,Lame,I'm gonna have to disagree with Lisa Shea. This game blows! This is coming from someone who has never really played any of the Prince of Persia franchises. If your idea of fun is jumping and hanging from ledges by all means this is your game. I will however give it up for the controls which are pretty responsive and intuitive. Try Zelda or Godfather for a better time.
2,Dissapointing,"I enjoyed bothPrince of Persia: Sands of Time for Xbox, andPrince of Persia 2 Warrior Withinon my Xbox, and I was excited to see what the Wii's innovative controller would bring to the franchise. I was disappointed.The game play was largely similar to the previous games except for the implementation of stealth kills, which are, for the most part, a tedious addition. Moreover, the controls are overly simplified and while you do swing the remote their is no comparison between how you swing and how the prince swings. Overall the game came across as a quick port in a slightly tired concept. I still think that there is a lot of potential in the Prince of Persia franchise and I will rent the next game in the series in the hopes that it improves. Until then I will wait patiently for someone to create a sword fighting game that does the Wii justice. Ninja Gaiden anyone?"
2,big disappointment,i expected this game to be episode 4 out of the series.... i was wrong. this game is nothing more then The Two Thrones using the wii controls. all in all the game is too easy in my opinion. and the camera controls are pretty sketchy. if you loved The Two Thrones and want to try it out on the wii... this game is for you. if you were looking forward to a brand new episode of this series... sorry to disappoint you.
1,Repeat,"This game is ridiculous. All they did was take Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones from Gamecube, slapped a new name on it, and made it Wii compatible. If you have played The Two Thrones, this game is a complete waste of money and time. However, if you have never played The Two Thrones, but enjoy Prince of Persia in general, this may be a good investment."
1,Disappointed,"Loved the Prince of Persia Trilogy! Had it for our Computer and we completed all three challenges. So when I saw that another one came out for the Wii I though great! Something more interactive for my husband to play. However, I was disappointed to find out that even though the game had a different name it was the same exact game as the TWO THRONES. So unfortunately I feel as though I wasted money!"
3,"Slow story, but good characters","This book really is about characters rather than a plot. Clare, who is 40, is dealing with old grief, her age, and a teen daughter having sex. Normal everyday occurences, but her own emotions and unrecognized feelings are creating uncertainty in herself and in her life.I picked this book up a few times, would read a few chapters and then set it aside. I finally finished it, and I did like the book, but it was slow going at times. Overal a 3 out of 5 rating"
1,Soap Opera on Paper; Predicitable and Repetitive,"I thought this book would be a good summer read, but unfortunately I just could not bring myself to read every word. About half way through it, I started skipping the paragraphs where lead-character Clare's thoughts were cut to half sentences and repeating words. I found this writing style very annoying. By the end of the book, I already knew what was going to happen, and only skimmed it to the final sentence. Reading it was much like watching a soap opera on TV. The characters, particularly Clare, often do and say stupid things. I'm sorry to say that I didn't connect with any of them."
1,BORING and DISTURBING,"Don't bother to open these little doors. I buy every book and article that I can find by Paul, He is usually the most stimulating, interesting, inovative and fun author. He was number one on my list.This collection is terrible in many ways. The stories and either boring, or unintersting and a couple are disturbing .It is ok to disturb your reader, but there are stories that make you think that Paul is so disturbed that you do not want to support him anymore by buying his books.Maybe this is just a collection of the stories that he wanted to through away but was published anyway.It will probably take me a year to buy another one of his books( That is a long time, since I buy about 3 books a day and he publishes about 3 books an hour.)"
3,Inexpensive stop gap,"For less than $10 per light, this isn't a bad package. They seem to be as bright as more expensive models. The difference is clearly in the construction as these are mostly made of common hard plastic, great for wet weather but not something that is going to last a lifetime.We needed something right away for the front of the house and these lil guys are doing the trick. Just don't expect some high quality light fixture that is heavy duty and meant to last.I give these about a 3-4 year lifespan under the best conditions."
2,KV24 Failed After 60 Days,"After extensive research, I purchased a KV24 from a local ""Brick & Mortar"" dealer. While the picture quality and features live up to the reviews, I cannot in good conscience recommend this TV.Less than two months after purchase it made a loud ""snap"" (high voltage arc) sound and stopped working. The ""standby"" light would blink, but the TV failed to turn on. Administering the ""hard reset"" recommended by Sony caused the TV to become completely inert.The unit has now been at a Sony authorized repair shop for a month. I am told the parts required for the repair are back ordered and I should expect the repair to take another two to three weeks, so the repair time will equal the useful life of the TV. Both the dealer and Sony have refused to replace the unit with a new one.This problem is common enough that it is described in a top link on Sony's service web site, so I suspect I'm seeing a basic design or QA problem."
1,Same Problem,"I echo the sentiment expressed above by ""e0102"". Same problem with TV going out and light blinking with no help from Sony's tech department except to suggest to return the set. Fortunately for me, this happened the second day I owned the set. I returned it for a refund and am considering the JVC 24""."
2,Very disappointed - sound is a disaster,"Got it home, plugged it in, and turned it on. Wait, turn it up. Wait, adjust the Bass, Treble. Switch modes. Repeat. Could not get this thing to sound as if it was in the room. Always souded like it was in the next room, or in a tin can. Ok, I'm a musician and sound is very important to me, but I don't see how anyone would be happy with way this TV sounds. The 10w amp and the WOW mode add up to nothing. This TV sounds terrible. Don't be fooled by the ""grilles"" on the front...they're for show. The speakers are in the BACK of the TV. What?Picture? Not too impressed with that either...way too contrasty for my taste, and the digital artifacts on edges caused by our digital cable service were all too present.We bought this TV becase it seemed to be the best, you know, top-of-the-line. Well after a week of trying to get it to look and sound as good as my little 19"" (with speakers on the front, mind you) we took it back.Look elswhere for happyness in TV land."
4,A good conclusion,"Of course it was a little predictable. Most of the books within this series were, but honestly...it didn't matter to me. I thought it was a great book. Simon and Miri have some wonderful chemistry. I recommend this or the other books in the series."
1,Disappointing,Takes characters and has them behave in poorly explained ways. The other books in this series at least believed in themselves. This one is not well done.
3,just an average read,I really found myself saying...is this over already! I was disappointed because the liner notes described an altogether different book. I expected a more sophisticated story line.
2,2 stars,"If you have not read Susan Carroll's books in this series prior to this one, then be advised, The Silver Rose is not a good place to begin. The first time reader gets the immediate impression that they have landed in the middle of something. This tells the story of the third and most gifted sister of the Cheney family, Miri, who holds what could be a fatal attraction for a witch hunter, Simon Aristide. However, she will need his help to stop the Dark Queen, Catherine De Medici, no matter what his profession is. Together, they battle the forces of evil and claim a great prize.** Lacking the background of the first two books, I felt lost. Miri did seem a terribly weak heroine to command such power. However, Ms. Carroll does have a beautiful use of prose. **Amanda Killgore"
3,Good-sounding cables with some challenges,"First, the cables sound great. I couldn't A/B them with my old, less expensive bi-wire cables (thanks, cat) but they certainly sound at least as good. They're also quite well packaged--each set in the pair is wrapped in a very think, heavy jacket that I think will be catproof.Now, to the downside. The cables are 10' long, which isn't going to work for people (like me) who can't put their amp between the two speakers. This was just my dumb mistake, but I thought I'd alert others.Also, the banana plug terminators are too large to fit into my amplifier. I've had other cables go in without a problem, but these won't. So if you were going to use the plug, be alert that you may end up doing some pliers work on these cables."
4,Get a real perspective on farming-the good & the bad...,"book of great impact. A realistic view into the challenges and demands of mono-cultural farming. If you want/need to understand the reality of farming and challenge your 'romantic' ideals, this book will provide that awakening and more. Most importantly, it leaves with you a clear sense of the honest influence fostered by an agrarian lifestyle - folks with integrity and values, least of which - fortitude and faith."
2,Big Fields Of Their Dreams,"Mr. Hanson, a 5th generation California vineyard keeper and professor at Stanford and member of the Hoover Institute with Donald Rumsfeld (Abu Ghraib and Misery Plantation), George Schultz (Iran-Contra and Bechtel water wars in Bolivia)and Condeleeza Rice (WMD's, yellow cake and no advanced warning of 911 and a clear case of Helsinki Syndrome) is an apologist for the Archer Daniels Midlands and ConAgra's of this world. Drink up!"
3,about time part 4 gets a release on dvd,"now i can complete my set although i would have prefered having part 4 solo instead of rebuying parts 2,3 just to get part 4 but i guess this will have to do universal really should have released it by itselt 1st then as a complete 4 box set like they did overseas...."
5,Norman is great,"the box set is great,, i wish part one was in it,,, you get to see how it all started,, if you love Norman,,,youll love these movies,, the boy who played young norman was great,,A boys best friend is his mother,,,,,"
5,nice collection of psycho sequels,"This collection is awesome for Psycho fans. Psycho II gets its own disc, while Psycho III and IV share the second disc of this budget release collection. Extras for Psycho II are pretty bare. You get a couple of spoken languages(English and Spanish), subtitles(Spanish, French, and English captions for hearing impaired). Would have been nice to have some sort of behind the scenes featurette.There are even less extra stuff for Psycho III. Besides a trailer, the fans get English,Spanish, and French audio tracks, and subtitles(Spanish, French, and English captions for hearing impaired).Psycho IV: The Beginning does not even get a trailer! It only has an english audio track, subtitles(French, and English captions for the hearing impaired). Well, at least it's on DVD. *sighs*"
2,The package is often as important as the contents!,I have a personal dilike for double sided discs finding that they usually do not retain the original quality of single sided copies and are more prone to scratching. This is particularly true if they are handled by children or people not aware there is a recording on the reverse side.The movies themselves are not bad for sequels but as expected the quality of the films declines with each new attempt to capture the magic and suspense of the original. The inherent problem with DVDs of this genre is that they can never deliver the same suspense and shock that the viewer obtains from the initial viewing. All in all a better than average effort for a multisequel package.
3,"Psyco II, III, and IV DVD",Psycho II was a decent film. Nothing is as good as the first but this held its own. Psycho III and Psycho IV were not worth watching.
5,psycho collectuon,its a great great films the onlt thing i would add i wish they added part one to the collection thats the only thing that i can complain about why would you not include the movie that started it all thats my only complaint but othe then that movie is a great movie to watch
1,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this movie. Jeremy Sisto, Poppy Montgomery, and Vanessa Marcil are some of my favorites. And although the acting was good; the script, directing, and production were simply poor. I downloaded this and took it on a plane. If I had not been trapped on a plane for hours, I doubt I would have made of through it. I kept hoping it would get better, but it did not. Can not recommend you spend you money on this one."
4,"A must have for tourists, but missing some helpful information","We went to London in January 2007. I was so glad we bought this book, as we constantly referred to the maps (in the book and the tear-out pocket map). The lists and descriptions of things to do around London were priceless, as were the suggestions. I relied on the maps of the different parts of the city to find our way around to the lesser known places or when we got a little off course. This was my 3rd time visiting London, so I wanted to see a few things that were off the beaten path and not the typical sites to see. The maps and book helped guide us through all the different parts of the city.The only thing I wish it had were more hotel reviews and restaurant reviews. Fortunately, with the internet, researching those topics is fairly easy. We had free internet access in the hotel we stayed at in Westminster (the City Inn Westminster, I think it was)."
2,Frommer's London 2001,"I was disappointed (actually angry) when I discovered that very few of the hotels offered by travel agents in their packages were not even listed in this guide book. Many of the omitted hotels were very well known. Be forewarned -- if you are interested in scoping out hotels in London, look elsewhere."
1,Low quality information,Have listed at least one non-existing restaurant in London. The other suggested restaurant had a different name from the one specified in the Guide. We almost went hungry. Do not buy this book.
2,London travel book-useless almost,"This book was just almost useless to me-Rick Steves' London book is WAY WAY much better. WIll never buy Froomer's books again-only used it to thumb through. Our trip to Paris and London was wonderful , but not by these books."
4,Frommer's(r) London 2003,"EXCELLENT travel guide! This is definitely one of the better travel guides I have seen! It really goes over the historic, tourist destinations along with shops, restaurants, etc. I only wish there were more photos!"
5,Love it,I recently got my Carhartt sandstone vest. This thing is great. lightweight but keeps me very warm. Works well with sweatshirts or just a good flannel. Feels very durable. Would deff buy again.
4,Great lacing toy for 3 yr old girls,"I bought 2 of these - one as a gift and one for my daughter. I was very happy with the product. The thickness of the wooden pieces is sturdy enough that kids can't break them (and I have a 1 yr old son who's tested this!). The only downside to the toy is that it comes with only 1 bear (and several adorable outfits). When my daughter has a friend over, it's not an activity they can do side by side - someone is left without a bear to dress. In summary, an excellent solo activity with some parent assistance and a superb product for long car rides."
4,A Fine Performance of Classic Soul,"Fans of circa-1970 r&B/soul or the modern day retro revival may really enjoy this album - a fine performance and solid collection of songs. She can belt them out but I found her voice to be thin in the high registers, not as well-rounded and musical as some of her more commercially successful contemporaries."
5,Urban planning made real,"You don't have to be an urban planner to appreciate what this video has to show you about urban living in a good range of cities on the planet. I like the visuals, the walking discussions, the interviews, and the insights. Well worth watching."
3,Sensitive buttons,"I bought this for working out at the gym. It has good sound, and is lightweight and comfortable to wear on my belt. But the buttons are very sensitive and the slightest bump will change the station. Also, when I pick it up in the morning I often find that it' has been accidentally turned on, and the batteries are low. There is a small ""Hold"" button on the front of the case that will lock in the controls, but this button is also very delicate and it can be easily bumped into the ""off"" position. I'd gladly spend a few dollars more and have controls that aren't so easily disturbed."
1,Why only in USA,I really would like to purchase this Sony portable.Why can you not sell to New Zealand?
3,An unfortunate Perspective,"A good, thorough analysis. It's unfortunate that the author(s) felt it unavoidable that they should fill the book with Christian propaganda. It really took away from the objectivity."
4,Nova - Japan's Killer Quake,"This is a good DVD and shows how the earth shifted causing not only the earthquake but also the tsuami. If you want to learn more, by all means this DVD is for you."
5,WOW,"What an extrodinair DVD. This added so much more than the news carriers showed on TV. This shows the true nature of the Tsunami's power. I lived 9 years in japan and I feel so sorry for all thoes that lost their lives and everything. I am now worried about the northern coast of the USA, cascadia fault zone..."
2,Shallow pockets,"The pockets in these shorts are like 2"" deep. So I never wear them because I have no place to stash anything."
2,Ignore the other review (but this thing does suck),"The other reviewer of this product obviously didn't read the directions. First of all, the unit comes with a piece that secures the battery in the remote. Second, I am assuming it is a limitation of the iPod's software, but when the remote adapter is plugged in, the iPod is supposed to say it is OK to disconnect. Having said that, the unit does suck. When the adapter is plugged in, you cannot use the iPod's controls or view anything on its screen. The remote is very buggy and often loses its connection to the iPod. If you go through songs too quickly, the information displayed on the screen will not always be correct. The iPod doesn't always respond to the remote. You can hear a buzzing in your earphones when information is being transferred to the remote. Battery life is pathetic. Finally, the remote scratches easily and is ugly. Suffice it to say, I returned mine."
5,Perfect for me and Makes a GREAT Gift!!,"I figured I would share with you the features I use - that would help you decide to by one for yourself and they make Great Gifts! It was designed for any iPod and iPhone with 30-pin dock connector and it displays current song/artist or current song/next song (no need to download playlist to remote), has patented pass-through allows charging while iJet is connected, has a water Resistent Remote that allows signal travels around corners and through walls and has 9 Function.They also include a universal Audio Cable for Home Stereo Hook Up. The remote allows you to adjust volume, Forward/Rewind track, Play/Pause and Stop playback and allows control of dock volume.I can't say enough good things about it. I have purchased over 24 as gifts for family and friends!"
1,Unreliable,"The only thing this remote does reliably is either claim to be out of range (5 feet from Ipod) despite multiple resets and resyncs of both the remote and the ipod, and freeze the ipod. Pity because it is a great idea for folks who hook their ipods up to their stereos and want to be able to control them."
5,Excellent Edition!,"This is an excellent paperback edition. The novel is divided into two separate books, and this is book one. It has a very well-written introduction by John Jay Allen. Also, there are plenty of footnotes throughout the novel to help you enjoy this magnificent masterpiece of Spanish literature."
5,An historical and emotional triumph!,"Just beginning the study of flamenco in the late 60's, I encountered Pohren's quirky little book. Soon I understood, for it pointed the true path, a path not seduced by the Carlos Montoyas and the latter Manitas de Platas of the concert style. What Pohren was trying to bring to light was - and still is - the heart and soul of flamenco and how it came to be in the first place! A must for any fan."
1,Do not buy it !,"I bought a US Stove 5500M Ashley to save money with heating. It burns one bag a day ($7.00) but it is not even close as potent as advertised. It is advertised to heat up from 1,200/1,500 sq ft, but it heats up to 500 sq ft, if that much.It is very noise, too. One can't watch TV or talk on the phone, or even have a conversation in the room where the stove is.Worst of all the warranty for electrical parts is for one year only, and those parts seem to be produced to last just a little longer than the warranty. I bought this stove last fall, one month after the warranty expired the igniter has melted. I have to spend U$50,00 to buy a new one. Luckily, I am skillful enough to fix the stove myself. Otherwise, I would have to pay U$200,00 plus parts for a technician to fix it.If you are still thinking about buying it. Buy it in a place that allow returns (in case you can put up with the noise), and buy extended warranty (because, most likely, it is going to break right after one year)."
3,Not a fan of the fans,"I purchased my king pellet stove at tractor supply. when I first started it I was suprised by the amount of heat it produced. it has been working good in this fridged Connecticut weather and is heating the space adequately and looks good. However, the fans , both the exhaust and the room fan are ridiciously loud. I am an electrical contractor and deal with fans all the time. I plan to suggest to US stove to come out with replacement fans of higher quality ( I would pay to upgrade them ) because other than that this unit is a home run . 1.5 bags a day thats about $7 per day. Good riddens oil company!Tom FisherNew Milford Ct"
1,", ignitor fails every year",the first blower motor had bad bearings and was very loud I replaced it . The big complaint is the igniter. It has never blown a fuse. The igniter melts and swells and bends. I have had to teplace it at least once every year. They gurantee replacement igniter for 1 year but when that fails u r on your own. They have a new part #80691 by new mfgr. I asked to swap an unused 80481 and they said no. So heres my honest and bad review. Don't buy from them.
4,My daughter likes them,"My wife and I got these for our four year old daughter for a homemade doctor kit. She likes them because they are pink, we think its kinda neat to hear her heartbeat."
3,worth the money but not more,"this is a toy for kids, not a real stethoscope.you won't hear much with it. you get what you pay for"
5,Great first time stethescope,this is just what I needed to display my stethescope cozies.....and for me to learn how to use one.....great product
1,Get what you pay for...,"Someone above stated the same issues I have with this. It hurts your ears, and does not hear a heartbeat. I'm disappointed."
2,Too tight on ears,I made the purchase to put in a child's doctor kit. Overall a bad idea as they are real and the magnified sound would be too much to be a toy. Aside from that they were very tight and wouldn't have been able to tolerate the fit anyway.
3,Can't hear heart beats very well,"Stethoscope is sturdy. Ear pieces are adult sized. I'd been under the impression they were smaller - more of a child's size. The length is child size but not the ear pieces. Child enjoys it. MUCH better than play scopes, for sure. Very nice for the price."
4,LIKE THE REAL,THE KIDS GOT THIS BEC DOC MCSTUFFINS WAS TOO EXPENSIVE AND SO THEY LOVE THESE! THEY WEAR THEM AROUND LIKE REAL DOCS
1,DO NOT BUY BECAUSE THE ANSWERS ARE WRONG!,"I purchased the ""Revised"" COOP/HSPT Study Cards on CD-Rom to help my son study for his upcoming HSPT test.There are three portions on the CD. 1) Arithmetic 2) Algebra 3) GeometryWe didn't study the Arithmetic portion and started with Algebra. When I saw that the answer to question #11) 5 x 0 = 5 was ""true"" I knew there was a problem. The subsequent 15 answers were also incorrect (the answers were for other questions). I emailed the company through their website a week ago but haven't received a response.We decided to switch to the Geometry section, but that portion was completely blank. Nothing there.Needless to say, I cannot let my son work with these study cards because he could be learning wrong information. I am really disappointed because some of the features of the product are pretty cool but those features are pointless if the information is wrong and therefore, unreliable."
1,Too broad and general,"I bought this book thinking I would learn everything I needed to know for a vinyl siding project. The book has one chapter on vinyl siding and many other chapters devoted to other forms of siding. Each subject is just broadly skimmed over essentially making it next to useless of a book.My recommendation, spend your money elsewhere."
2,Of Limited Interest,"This pretty blah mystery set in contemporary London is too heavily reliant on the characters' past political proclivities to be truly gripping or even all that interesting. It all revolves around council housing (the UK equivalent of public housing) and how the formerly radical have managed to finesse their way into the current ruling party. All in all, well worth skipping."
4,Seems like the real thing,I have quite a few batteries and got tired of taking them into the battery store to have them checked. This seems very accurate as I tested some batteries I knew were good and it agreed. Doesn't seem to happen at the battery store.
3,Cat Mate large cat door,"It amply served the purpose - to replace a cat door that had become too tight given the cat's weight gain. It is not as easy to operate (lock on different sides) as the old one. It took a while for the cat to get used to it, even though he'd used the old one for 8 years, because the door is stiffer and more difficult for the cat to push open than the other. It is also quite noisy -- as it bangs shut. I would have appreciated more detailed directions for installation -- I had installed the old one myself easily; I needed to hire someone to do this one. I particularly like the brown frame, as it sits in a brown wooden door."
2,"Seals too tight, cats can't open, hard to install","Very disappointed - I'm now on my third foster cat who will not use the door unless it is propped open. The seal seals so tightly they cannot push it open, and I've watched them try! I installed this in the wall of a shed to give them access to a cat run. The imsructions showed cutting one of the frames down with a utility knife. I almost took my finger off trying that! Ended up using a jigsaw. Fortunately the shed wall is so thin that the jagged edge went inside when the two fit together.It is nice strong plastic and if you needed a strong seal due to high winds AND you have stronger cats that mine, this might work for you. I'm back on here looking for the classic vinyl flap kind that will hopefully fit the hole I put in the wall..."
2,Cat's Tail,"Gets caught in the door as it closes, as a result she won't use it. That's all I have to say about that."
3,The door can be loud,"I've used 2 cat doors to allow the cats to go from the basement into the house - one with a soft plastic flap and one with a hard plastic flap. This door has a hard plastic flap that can be locked which allows you to control if the animal can get in, go out, or move both ways freely. So I could see this being used on an outside door where you'd let your cat out, lock it from the inside to prevent another cat from exiting, but allow the outside cat to come inside.My only real complaint is that when the cats use the door, it kind of makes a loud noise when the door closes. Also, the door came in brown and I'll need to paint it white. It sticks out. But all in all, it does the job and is very inexpensive."
4,Beware the Pin Conundrum,"As other reviewers mentioned, this RAM will not fit motherboard memory slots designed for PC3200 184-pin DDR memory. This is PC2-3200 240-pin DDR2 RAM. It is easy to miss the distinction between DDR vs. DDR2 in the product description, and unfortunately the 240-pin configuration is only mentioned below in the Technical Details.Kingston ValueRAM is always an excellent buy, but of little use if it doesn't fit in your machine. Choose wisely, grasshopper."
3,Wrong Product,This was the wrong product it was my bad at the time can't really blame the company for this one just me.
1,Kinston RAM,Kingston ValueRAM - Memory - 2 GB ( 2 x 1 GB ) - DIMM 240-pin - DDR II - 400 MHz / PC2-3200 - CL3 - 1.8 V - unbuffered:very poor product: unable to fit into any of my PC2-3200 of different computers. Request for refund is still pending.
3,should of passed it up,When i got the ram is was all stocked Then one thing poppen into the picture Pc3200 Is 2.5 and this ram is CL3.0 It fits a pc 4200 socket Not a pc3200 slot But hay I learned somthing new Read the small print If you are after Ram It is a steal if you have a MB that will take it
2,getting the wrong one,Hi I order this kit and the image did not mach what I got and it does not fit!!
1,This was the worst service ever.,"Paid for one day, overnight service. Nearly, doubled the cost of the item.Got one week service.Went to CDW got the same item at three quarters of the cost in 2 days.And that included sales tax.Return policy at Amazon was good. But I didn't buy this item to test the return policy."
5,I love this soup,"This is a excellent soup. Good winter time soup. You can add your own choice of meat. I prefer sausage. The store I normally shop and purchase this soup from had been out for several weeks. Thanks to Amazon I was able to find it here, and a little cheaper also. Fast delivery. Thanks"
4,great for an appetizer or meal,"I love this soup. It's great, especially for how easy it is to make. It's not quite grandma's, but I really enjoy it as a lunch on a cold day, or as a quick first course at a dinner. A great thing to keep in the pantry for low energy meals or cold days."
4,A very different kind of movie guide...,"I got into movie-review books when wanting to get reviews from professional critics on movies of my favorite genere; horror/ slasher films. I first picked up Roger Eberts and Lenord Maltins books. Un-surprisingly, as most critics seem to despise any kind of slasher pic, they panned pretty much every movie I looked up. Frustrated by thier harshness, I next turned to the Video & DVD guide. I was pleastntly surprised. Whoever reviewed these movies gave films like, for example, ""Halloween 2"" and ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"", three stars!, while Ebert and Multin gave them below two, probably just because they were gory, and they consider that a big no-no for any horror movie to be good. Most of the horror/ slasher pics. in this book got two stars or more (except for those truly un-deserving ones). It's as tho the critic were looking through a horror-fans perspective! I defintely reccomend this book!"
4,An engaging biography of the famous erotic artist,This book examines the life and motivations of the famous and well-loved erotic artist; Tom of Finland. With many pictures from Tom's comic strip style early drawings through his evolution as a skilled master of the homoerotic.
5,"Get the best, forget the rest !","I have shopped around for various models before I got this one.I considered larger sets: for the price, I could have gotten a cheap 36 inches. I settled on the Sony from the various reviews I read.Simply put: I wasn't dissapointed! The image is stunning and the sound is amazing. Connections at the back will let you hook-up everything you have and the remote is likely to control it.I poundered on the alternatives for a long time but there is simply no better TV out there, period."
1,Does not power on,"When I first bought my t.v. and took it out of the box, I could not get the t.v. to turn on. After re-setting the t.v. several times I was finally able to get the t.v. to power on. I've had the t.v. for about 2 years now and have had nothing but trouble with it. Sony said they would warranty the parts but I would have to ship it to California at my expense. No thanks. I recommend that you do not buy this product."
1,Live Simply....Recycle this book!,"Wanda and Frank are completely tedious, judegemental, and self-absorbed. This book could be summed up in the following sentences, ""Everyone should live their lives like we do. We are such wonderful writers so we will spend the entire book talking about how wonderful we are because we live simply. We want you to know every asinine detail of our lives such as how we remodeled our bathroom with driftwood."" This book was for them to feel all superior and nothing more. Wanda and Frank...Stay at the orchard and away from your wordprocessors!"
2,i'm afraid i didn't like the writing either,"maybe couples shouldn't write books together. i don't know if they were complimenting themselves, or more likely each other, but it got very tiresome. we all have to build up a certain degree of belief in ourselves, but it is not fun to read other people doing this. i thought the Goldstone's books (a couple who write about book-collecting) suffered from this, but this book really got on my nerves. i like the life they describe in the book, i just don't like all the ego that came with the description, it greatly distracted from the information. they also go on about how great their friends are, but they manage to make this annoying as well. i recommend your money or your life by dominguez & robin, or living the good life: how to live sanely & simply by the nearings instead of this book."
1,A Poor Attempt to Illustrate Simple Living,"I have just completed reading Simple Living: One Couples Search for a Better Life by Frank Levering and Wanda Urbanska. I am now under the belief that anyone can write and publish a book if they have enough words assembled. The authors took a great idea, and wrote what I believe is a collection of thier experiences with people that the authors have met though thier life experiences. The amazing thing is, these people add nothing to the concepts of simple living! If you are looking for a book that describes the process of transforming one's existence to one of simplier living, you are strongly advised to look elsewhere. If you are looking for a collection of unrelated encounters, then this may be the book for you."
4,"A man, a woman, and an orchard: must be paradise!","This book is charming in every respect. Levering and Urbanska are highly intelligent, thoughtful individuals who made one decision that completely changed their lives: they traded in their hectic L.A. lifestyle for a quiet existence managing a family-owned orchard in a remote corner of Virginia. Along the way they learned to appreciate the value of frugality, family ties, caring for the environment, volunteering, and community activism. I was sorry when the book ended and disappointed that the writers didn't provide the address and directions to their orchard on the back leaf of the book -- I'm more than ready to make the 6 hour drive from D.C. to the Levering Orchard to pick a bucket of ripe, sweet cherries!"
4,"Creative beats, humorous lyrics","I just recently purchased this album, and it was definetely worth the money. Knowdaverbs has some of the most creative beats I've ever heard, leaving you sitting and thinking: How did they come up with that background music? I also enjoyed the humor he worked into his lyrics. Such humor can be found in Plane Scared (where he's giving his opinions of flying in planes), Me & My Mic, Stu and His Fish (""You might have seen me on my other album with my head cut off""), and so on. Plus, he did all this and still had time to deliver christian messages in each song. Doing that takes talent. The best beats are featured in ""Phullon Empty"", ""If I Were Mayor"", and ""God Is Big"". Get this album!"
5,"Knowdaverbs, THE BEST CHRISTIAN RAP CD OUT THERE!!!","I like the beats of eminem, but what I don't like about eminem is the cussing. Every song has at least 2-3 cuss words. I'm only aloud to listen to christian music, so I heared about this rapper called ""knowdaverbs"", so I searched it and i found it. So then I start listning to it, I was AMAZED!!! It had the beats like eminem but with out all the cussing, on top of that, it was christian!!! I was sooo excited about this that I just had to get this c.d. (I haven't gotten it yet but I promise I'll get it). So if you love hard rap or rock your going to love this cd. GET IT!!!"
2,disappointing,"With all due respect to him as a musician, I really did not enjoy this album. I hate to be critical but I did not find this very inspirational as Christian music. As hip-hop, I also found it a bit disappointing. I applaud anyone who sings with God in their heart, but that doesn't automatically make it good music."
4,"If this was a movie, you should rent it","Knowdaverbs has some innovative beats in here, but they're quickly countered by banal, repetitive choruses. (The only exception is ""God is Big"", which is impressive). Of course, he can make up for this with the inventive words. Instead of focusing on any one analogy like other similar artists, he jumps from metaphor to metaphor every few lines, leaving you trying to decipher what he's really saying. And the subjects themselves are great, everything from fear of flying (""Plane Scared"") to James Bond (the title track). Unfortunately, the music doesn't show nearly as much variation, making you wish you could just skip to the next verse instead of hearing that mediocre chorus repeated twice more. Definitely better than his previous albums, but Knowdaverbs has a ways to go."
2,Not That Good,"I listen to a lot of mainstream rap {50 cent, eminem, snoop dogg, etc}. My youth group leader urged me to listen to some Christian rap, so I bought the 1st cd I could find, which was thisKnowdaverbs has the voice and the talent to make good music, but he falls short. His rhymes are elementary and repititive. The beats are very good, but the lyrics aren't the best. He also relies too much on guests to sing on his music, he should do more rapping himself.I would listen to Christian rap if there was any good stuff out there, but sadly most Christian rap is like this, and it isn't very attractive.I appreciate his efforts to make good music, but it falls shortThere are other good groups out there like KJ-52, Audio Adrenaline, and the Newsboys who are better than he is. Kanye West is good too {He swears, but he has a good message about Jesus and forgiveness}"
3,Jance Disappoints in Predictable Plot,"While I usually enjoy reading about J.A.Jance's hero, J.P. Beaumont, I was disappointed by the predictable plot and resolution of this novel. As a current Seattleite, I relish Jance's descriptions of my fair city which are both amusing and accurate. Try others of Jance's novels, but I would recommend skipping Improbable Cause."
3,an ok read,it wasn;t as good as previous J.A Jance books but rather ok I like some of her other books better
3,J A Jance at her average,"I have never any Jance book was not good. It is always good to have a Jance novel on my tablet and/or smartphone for those long Dr. office waiting room days.She does such a great job of making you feel you are really in the location. The desert southwest or San Francisco, if you've ever been there you will flash on memories of Lake Union with the float-planes docked or Phoenix with drifting hot air balloons. That being said I had a hard time locking on to Beaumont in ""Improbable Cause."" It seems if I had another ebook loaded on my device, i went to the other one first.A dead dentist that everyone agreed ought to have been taken out anyway and a spiderweb of interlocking suspects, some of whom you wouldn't have even called ""bad"" guys.This one is worth the cost of the ebook, but as for me, it was my ""back-up book"" to go to after I had finished something else that gripped my attention."
2,Why would anyone pay this much?,"These are cute (I have two), but $71.35????!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I picked up two of them for five buck apiece as a clearance item at my local supermarket!"
1,TOO QUIET! don't waste your time...,"I bought this for my grandma so she could wear on a lanyard and activate it if she fell. Unfortunately, we can't even hear it 15 feet away from the front door to her in-law suite.It is also unbearably loud while in the room... I suppose if she were deaf I'd get a 130db version and hope for the best, however we simply attached the lanyard to her cell phone and she carries that around instead."
5,Works Like a Charm,I bought this flash drive for my BD-S350 as none of the other flash drives I have fit. This one works perfectly and contains plenty of storage for BD Live.
5,Slick storage,"I ordered a set of these for my hi rez promotional materials. Tiny, great form factor and an eye catcher. Very pleased."
5,Perfectly compact.,"Its small, very small and it has four letters on it that spike the price: S-O-N-Y. But, if you want a small flash drive that comes with a keychain carrier, here it is.For my personal use, I plug this into my Sony Car Radio that has a USB slot. I didn't want a protuding flash drive sticking out of there; I wanted a small, discretely large USB device with a lot of capacity to put my MP3s on.It is great ! I love creating folders/playlists on it and taking it on the run. Two great Sony products working in synchronicity, providing me with a harmonious existence. I was not concerned with compression software or more than 1-2 Gb capacity (although Sony does have this in those sizes).To summarize, it met my needs and works great without any problems, therefore, I accord this device an overwhlemingly positive review.(it costs a bit more because its super small and because its a sony. deal with it or move on) Cheers !"
4,PROXIM ORINOCO,I like to card has good seed and is versa with a/b/g Had a orinoco gold that I love card is still going strong just wish the cards were flush insted on sticking out
1,nothing like DK's infinitely more informative books,"I was really surprised at how low the productions values were and how totally uninformative this video was. I expected it to have a popular entertainment format. However, I also expected it to show some of the countless great still and moving images that now exist of the planets and the solar system. But it did not. In fact, the number of actual planet images was quite low, and what we got instead was a lot of cheap looking computer generated filler."
2,Kitsch and sink,"With its repetitive piano vamps, spacey vibes and over-the-top bongo-liciousness, Cal Tjader's Latin Kick falls somewhere between real jazz and Esquivel. Muy ridiculoso."
1,Un-satisfied Did not receive compact disc,"As of 10/13/2009, I have yet to receive the ""Glory, Honor and Praise CD by Angela Spivey. My credit card has been charged but I have not received the compact disc. I do not want to write poor review, hopefully this misunderstanding can be rectified quickly. Thanks in advance."
4,Amazing Results,This book is awesome. My boyfriend and I have adopted some of the principles in our weight training workouts and we can already see and feel a difference. It is worth it if you are passionate about achieving your strength goals.
4,Good Guitar...,"Just a quick note... I am not a guitar player, but from what I know it seems like a well made and quality instrument for the price. One problem: I thought the edge was black. It is turquoise green. :/"
5,Oscar Schmidt OG10CE Full Size Cutaway Acoustic Electric,This is a great guitar. Sound Quality and Size is perfect for an acoustic/electric combo. I am very happy with the instrument and the value offered through Amazon...40% off regualr retail price.
3,propaganda,Guitar is OK. Acceptable playability and finish for the price.It's the only white acoustic/electric guitar I found that cheap.But what's up with the Christian fish on the head??? Shouldn't we get a discount for propaganda?My solution: I painted over it.But unless you are planning on using it at church or in a Christian band i find it pretty lame.
1,don't buy these,"i bought these for my ipod. the sound was good (i like bass). the fit was also good - comfortable with a good level of external noise blocked out. But ...the cord! i found it impossible to get used to the cord being short for one ear and long for the other. i kept yanking the short one out.also, the main cord is way too short to use by itself - unless you want to carry your mp in your shirt pocket or on your shoulder. and the extension cord that comes with it is way too long and not easy to handle.on top if it all, the main cord did not plug in securely into the extension cord - it kept falling out.i sent them back, went to radio shack and got a good-enough pair of in-ear phones for half the price.btw, be wary that some of the glowing reviews posted here for various products may be buzz generated by a new kind of marketing technique (see ny times article, 12/5/04) now being used by such firms as bzzagent (bzzagent.com)."
2,Thoroughly overated earbud,"I've read many a review waxing on about these earbuds but having listened and compared them to many other units imho they are overated and overpriced. They seem totally unbalanced with a muddy boomy bottom end and a high end that tends towards sibilance. Some bass improvement can be made by putting small pieces of tape over the three holes on the back of each earbud, but I much prefer Koss KSC-50 and Sennheiser MX 500. If you absolutely have to have an ear seal I can't recommend anything more than the Etymotic ER4S although pricey."
1,Good sound; bad quality control,"The ""ear"" fit and sound of these earbuds are great--however the connector between the earbuds and the extension (which is necessary if you are holding it with your arm by your side) is problematic. The fit is not tight, thus sometimes the sound is in the left side, sometimes the right. If you diddle the connection for a bit, you can achieve sound in both ears, but since it frequently becomes disconnected, it is frustrating. I hope this is a manufacturing problem and not a feature of the earbuds."
2,Don't bother,"The KOSS el cheapo earbuds are far superior to these in sound quality, believe me. I have both right here and I listen to Live365.com at work all the time. No comparison. Don't waste the money. The KOSS are only $20 and twice as good."
5,Love 'em,"I bought these as a replacement for the white earbuds that came with my iPod. I wasn't happy with the iPod's headphones because they tended to fall out and were uncomfortable after a while. These do neither. They're very comfortable and block out outside noise very well. Sound quality is great. The iPod's earbuds didn't fit into my ears very well, so I didn't get much bass output. In comparison, the Sonys have more than enough.I also like the ""stealth"" factor. Since the cord is black, no one knows I have a $300 iPod in my pocket anymore!"
2,What a difference new headphones can make!,"I bought these headphones after growing dissatisfied with the ones that came with my iPod. Now I wish I had done it way sooner. The Sony earbuds do a much better job of delivering the entire music spectrum, without anything lost. I like a lot of bass, and these headphones are good at making sure I get it all. Before, I would purposely not play bass-heavy music because the standard Apple earbuds did such a ... job of delivering the low end of the spectrum. The highs are there too, with good fidelity.One caveat: the Sony earbuds block out much of the ambient sound in a given environment. This can be good, like when you're in a noisy gym or on a plane. This is not ideal, however, when you need to hear what's going on around you, like in a departure gate, waiting for your row to be called."
2,Same Old,"I have yet to figure out what, exactly, is so special about this conditioner. It is not as rich of a conditioner as I expected, and does a mediocre job in strengthening, smoothing, energizing, and soothing my strands (as advertised). Save yourself the disappointment."
2,Needs to be re-written..,This book is a disappointing hodge-podge compendium of works by various authors. The chapter on CFS/Fibromyalgia-ADD link could have and should have been a milestone work that catapulted the book and the authors to world recognition but they totally dropped the ball and missed a golden opportunity here. The parts of the book that are actually written by Nadeau are quite good (few though it may be) but everything else will leave you bewildered. Too bad. Maybe if they revise it and clean it up with a better editor I will be able to recommend it.
5,Covering all stages of life,"Collaboratively edited by Kathleen Nadeau and Patricia Quinn, Understanding Women With AD/HD is an impressive anthology of essays by experts addressing issues specific to women with AD/HD. Covering all stages of life from youth, college years, married life, motherhood, workplace matters, and the struggle to properly balance one's life, Understanding Women With AD/HD is an encompassing, ground breaking work that resonates with understanding for the plight of facing life's challenges with a mind that tends to over focus, especially at the worst possible times. Understanding Women With AD/HD is a highly recommended contribution to personal, professional, and academic AD/HD reference collections."
4,Great reference book,"This book contains valuable info not easily found elsewhere, for women with ADD / ADHD. EXCELLENT questionaires for evaluation and self-knowledge. Discusses how hormones and hormone changes affect ADD. Also discusses frequently co-existing conditions and treatment strategies, as well as the empowerment that can come with a diagnosis of ADD / ADHD. This book reads like a textbook but is not as heavy as most. moves quickly along and is neatly divided into specific areas of interest."
5,six stars!!!!,"The communication between these two performers is at the very highest level. Indeed, I usually play this for people and scream ""this is what is meant by musical communication"". Aside from the technical brilliance and flawless execution of the playing, this is flat-out one of the all time laid-back, mellow-swinging sessions ever produced. Every piece achieves an utterly smooth flow. Think of the hypnotic modal aura behind Kind of Blue, the singular brilliance behind Coltrane's My Favorite Things or the complex moody lyricism behind a Wayne Shorter arrangement -- this stuff gives us a comprehensive view of a particular kind of musical language and it creates whole new emotional environments. Similarly with Blues For Two, which provides an answer to the following question: just how far can a duo format go in terms of sheer rhythmic beauty?"
4,great taste !,"One of the first Vinyl records I owned, glad to have it on CD,Zoot plays great both on teno and soprano with his usual big honest saxophone sound. Pass is a band on his own, providing perfect tasteful chords and playing bass lines at the same time.The record sounds very clear with no additional reverb or any studio tricks, It's like having these two masters in your room playing for you, right in front of you."
3,A Bathroom read...Not bad though,"Thios book is one that has many entertaining stories, as well as some that are just plain insignificant and stupid. The author uses every story he could get his hands on that has some lement of humor ow interesting facts and puts it in the book. However, while many of the stories are outrageously funny, a majority are just filler.One aspect that made this book easy to read was that the book is composed of over 50 very short ""tales"" or stories about individual incidents. You can read a story and read another one a week later and you haven't missed anything. It is entertaining but not very informative.If you are looking for a fun and quick read, this book will help fulfill those needs. It does provide some insight into the behind the scenes of the legal profession. If you are looking for a real in-depth look at how lawyers work, this is not the book for you.An entertaining and casual read, but not very informative. Just three stars but a fun book."
3,I assume I looked for some thing a bit more visual,The book is written a bit to heavy and not visual enhalfI'd rather some thing lighter with way more visual descriptions
1,Baby Steps,I think I dislike this mostly due to the kindle fire I'm reading it on! I can't find a way to exit without filing through the entire book?
2,Great little book,"This book takes us through the entire process from project design and layout to developing a list of materials and cut list. It shows layout and marking tools to transfer the measurements accurately to the wood. You May also likeHow To Get Started In Woodworking...The construction of handcrafted wood creations.It also presents some simple jigs which I found very interesting. For a very small book, there is a wealth of information."
3,"Grether""s Pastilles",My wife has a long time tickling sensation in the back of her throat that makes her cough. A friend gave her a pastille and it seemed to ease the irritation. She has to use them frequently and thinks that they did not help enough to keep her from going back to her old ones. They are sugar free and a lot less expensive.She is slender and wants to stay that way. The cost would not stop me from purchasing them if their effectiveness was more lasting and that much better than the standard lozenges.
1,Ripped Off,"I have a problem throat in that I am hoarse a lot. I was so hopeful that these lozenges would be soothing and help me out. Well, they do taste good but are nothing more than a glorified gummy candy. For $50, that is unacceptable. I have emailed the shipper twice requesting instructions on how to return for refund and have gotten no response. So I cannot recommend this product."
2,Simple Knits for Easy Living,"This book is the EXACT same book as Erika Knight's book: Comforts of Home, simple knitted accents. ""Simple Knits for Easy Living"" was produced for England's market while the ""Comforts of Home"" was produced for the United States market.I was very disappointed in the book and thought it lacked creativity. It's definitely TOO basic for an advanced knitter. Not at all worth buying."
3,Ok,"Ok book, not the best patterns, but will be fun to try a few things in the book. Nice pictures, and the directions look easy."
2,Takes a long time to download......I agree it takes up space,"Gosh, it's like a long trial download for NOTHING!!!!!!! For such a bad game/I agree.(That's what other people said too.)And, you BUY it and you pay bla bla bla money for NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,18 wheels of steel convoy,"I just bought this game and trust me.You should not waste your money.There were some problems with the game.First..When you get tired of it and you want to save it,you can't.You have to cancel you current job to save it.Second..the damaged is annoying.You don't hit anything,but the damage bar still moves and then your truck slows down and stops.Third..You don't have a good enough map.Fourth..The game is slow,but then again I might have to change around the game play.There might be more problems with it,but if you have it,you're figure them out.I gave it a star cause it was a little good.There were more places to go and it was a little fun.If you love trucking games,get the other titles,but not this one(unless you don't mind the problems and stuff)."
1,DONT BUY,So i got this for a X-Mas present and at first i was like Yay. so i also got a new gaming pc and the installation went fine but when i tried to load the game it got to the 18 wos convoy screen after the scs software sign and the music stopped and it crashed. also my computer is 64bit and the game is 32bit so i would slightly reccomend for older computer users
5,A must have for every trader regardless of experience.,"After spending 20 years ""investing"", I have spent the last 10 years learning to trade on shorter time frames and spent thousands on learning materials and seminars. Finally, a book by a trader for traders that brings it all together. Wish I could have read this book first and saved myself 10 years of needless expense."
2,Some usefull information but also a lot of fluff,"I purchased this book after a very careful review of the contents and reading several online reviews. While there was a little bit of information that I found useful, it wasn't enough to justify the price of this purchase. You can read most of what this book tries to teach for free in about 4-5 minutes if you know the right websites to visit."
5,Addresses the most important elements of trading,"Having attended John's seminars and following his work from his website, I eagerly anticipated his book. It was worth the wait. A clear explaination of specific trading setups, but more importantly, an emphasis on trading plans, mental consistency, and risk and money management - the keys. A great read for those actively trading and essential for those considering doing so."
4,Strategies for Traders by Traders,An excellent back-up to John's excellent seminars with even more detail! Fresh transparency of his actual strategies by a successful Trader. A good read and reference book.
4,"Very Readable, Great Stuff","I must admit, this is a great book. Good for the intermediate trader, as well as a fairly knowledgeable beginner. I think the main point I should stress is that this guy is actually a good writer. Often, trading books are dull as paint, particularly Technical Analysis books. Not so this book.My one issue is that after trying a few of the trading system examples on paper over a period of a week, they are frequently subject to failure. But as I read in a different review earlier today, someone noted that ""once a system is out, it is effectively dead"". I can see that point. So remember to adapt these systems to your trading style. Also, remember there is no sure thing in the markets."
3,For full time advanced day traders,"If you trade primarily on 5 min charts and are willing to try and subscribe new proprietory TA tools, this book is for you. Otherwise, I strongly recommend you to give it a pass. Those sections on trading psychology are okay. However, I doubt how many readers can truly understand the complexities of the many setups (trading tactics on different market situations), identify them correctly and apply them profitably. For a common investor/trader/reader, a combined shot of ""High Probability Trading by Marcel Link"" plus ""Trading in the Zone by Mark Douglas"" would be more effective and efficient."
1,A waste of paper,"Total waste of time and money. The guy is a promoter and salesmen at best. There's not a chance this guy makes money with these ideas. Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a good book on proper money management, instead of stolen, obsolete, and ineffective strategies."
5,comprehensive overview of trading,"Excellent book - in my opinion, should be on every beginner to intermediate trader's list of 'must-reads'. Is comprehensive because it addresses assessing market internals, favorite trade setups, creating a trading plan, and trader psychology (includes a personality test), all of which is a fairly comprehensive list. The book can read cover-to-cover or selectively by topic. The writing style is insightful, direct, clear and includes easy-to-understand charts and examples. Book is written by someone with a very keen mind, who seems to love his topic and shares a lot of his own experience and conclusions. As an intermediate trader, this book added a few more tools to my list of trade set-ups. A lot of this could also be learned by being a member of the author's trading website. I would recommend this book."
1,SALESPITCH SALESPITCH SALESPITCH,THIS BOOK IS YOUR AVERAGE SALES PITCH BOOK. EVERY CHAPTER HE EXPLAINS HE HAS SYSTMES AVAILABLE AT HIS WEBSITE WHICH HE MENTIONS ABOUT A BILLION TIMES. [...] I DONT RECOMMEND ALL THE STRATEGIES HE EXPLAINS ARE CUSTOM TAILORED TO HIS SYSTEMS AND THE FUTURES MARKET
3,Book explains mechanics of trading very good.,However if any of Carters trading systems where all that great I'm sure he would not be selling a book he would be making a living trading and him and Warren Buffet would be drinking buddies think about it. Take his Scalper Buys and Scalpers Sells technique maybe it worked in 2005 before the volitility jumped up but I'll bet it won't work now.
1,Is this a good book?,"I have been trading for a few years but couldn't understand many of the author's concepts and some rules seem to be contradictory. For example: ... most REVERSALS take place after three consecutive higher or lower closes... and a few paragraphs later under Trading Rules: ... after three consecutive higher closes I go long ... To make things additionaly confusing on the following graph you can clearly see higher closes but the author takes short position??Also, author uses Keltner Channel as if it is widely spread BUT that indicator is not available with the latest Metastock, Quicken Share Analyser...I've found some new ideas in the book but often unclear, confusing and contradicting."
2,Don't Lose Your Money Trading These Methods,The review by Ctrader is correct. The scapler method begins on p.167. The pictures shown disagree with Carter's stated rules. You'll lose your account trading John's methods. I have coded several of them and backtesting proves that. He wants you to subscribe to his service.
2,Easy reading but Flawed,"I bought this book because of rave 5 star review. After reading through most of the major sections, I've decided to back test one of his idea. Chapter six is about Opening Gap trading and author claims to be a high percentage trade. First, I analyze S&P and realized profit factor and % of winning is not impressive at all. Maybe it does work on DJ. I tried DJ and it also fails what the author suggested. While there are some good theories, but I think the author has not backtested it - another cherry picking case studies. Also, I check the examples used in the book. The data/charts used by author seemed to be very different from what I am using (Pinnacle data). Don't just plug-and-play this one."
2,Nothing Special,"The parts on psychology and money management are okay but they are basically just a rehash of what has already been written by others. The trading methods section didn't keep my interest since I dont have time to watch the markets all day. If you have extra money laying around it might be worth getting but there are better books out there in my opinion, especially for the price."
3,Mastering the Trade,"I like John Carter - I like him a lot. But there were some disappointments for me in this book. Namely, several chapters are of little or no use without proprietary indicators and downloads. Repeatedly throughout the book, Carter casually refers the reader to his website but nowhere does he mention that they are very, very expensive. The indicators are typically $400 to $500 each - you can buy a package of them for $1500 to $2000 - and the downloads require you to sign up for an expensive subscription to one of his website trading products. I still like Carter but, in my opinion, his credibility suffered a bit from these omissions."
3,"Worthwhile reading, but seriously flawed","The majority of books and other materials on day trading and/or swing trading can safely be classified as snake oil, not deserving of even one star. This book is not snake oil, but it is not a classic, either. The strengths of this book are the fact that it is written by someone who obviously is a trader. The chapter on TICK, Trin, and other tools for determining the underlying strength or weakness of the stock market is very good. The section on psychology offers good advice, though little that has not been done better in THE DISCIPLINED TRADER. Nevertheless, some of the strategies presented in other chapters are written rather ambiguously (esp the chapter on ""bricks""). The gaps chapter offers little that I haven't seen elsewhere. And, perhaps most disappointing of all, there is no evidence presented whatsoever (backtesting) that the strategies actually work."
3,Read with caution,"I found the pivot method works, gap play works sometimes, but the so called 3:52 method never works for me. I doubt some methods in the book still work in 2008."
5,Good Reference Book,"Not for those who have no experience or training in trading. John Carter has actually mastered trading, but it is not an easy task, and this book should not be used to embark on a trading journey. It was a great reference, but I'm not sure how much is relevant in today's market."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS ABOUT TRADING,"A serious book, usefull for trading Stocks, futures, FOREX, etc. Honest, realistic, applicable content written by a professional trader, based on his long experience.AS Peter Borish - Chairman of One Chicago and Former Head of Research for Paul Tudor Jones - said, ""...John Carter's new book is an outstanding place to start a realistic, grounded approach to mastering the trade."""
5,Excellent,"Well rounded book on trading for people to gain an overview of all markets. The best ones like this are by those who actually trade.This is one of the first I read as a beginner, where some of the things were over my head but still held a lot of interest. Re-reading it now brings out the full benefit. Great book."
3,"ONE OF BETTER TRADER BOOKS, BUT ...","THE TRADING BOOKS I HAVE SEEN ARE MOSTLY GARBAGE.THIS ONE IS A CUT ABOVE THOSE.BUT, AFTER READING THE CHAPTER ON GAPS,(HE FADES BOTH THE UP AND DOWN) I GOT BUSY WRITINGA PROGRAM TO TEST IT. DOESN'T WORK.JUST FROM THE OPEN TO THE CLOSE GAP UPS TENDTO GO A BIT FURTHER AND THE SAME FOR GAP DOWNS."
1,No Quality,"First of all, i should point out that no one should expect someone to release ""proven techniques for profiting"" about the markets. The title is just for marketing purposes, and none of the trading methodologies in the book are by no means consistently profitable techniques. However, some chapters can be valuable for beginners.Conclusion: Low value."
2,Mastering the Trade,"Being well written it leads to a strong sense of confidence about the trading ideas put forward.In addition there are many expressions of criticism for anyone that does not follow trades to the letter.Having traded some and simulated the others I believe there is nothing in this book that is directly a money generator. The views are too simplistic (cookie cutter almost) to be practicable and there is no direction on how to develop.Easy read, bad execution.Many better books out there on successful trading style and techniques."
4,saved on my DVR,"This is the only live from the Met broadcast I have saved on my DVR for longer than a month. The singing is very good all around, some of the best I've seen from Dessay and Florez. The production is hit and miss for me.On the hit side, updating this drama to current day make sense because it is a simple story of a girl being mis-accused of infidelity, and the storyline translates well to any age.On the miss side the director thought it would be a brilliant idea to set it as an opera in rehearsal. The opera in rehearsal bit is cheap and does not translate well at all. In fact you can't really tell when they are in rehearsal mode and when they aren't, it was a really dumb idea. In fact the show only works if you more or less ignore that they are supposed to be somehow in rehearsal. Once you ignore the dumb concept seeing them in current day clothing makes the interaction between the characters more believable."
1,Ludicrous,I saw this at the MET HD. The production is a nightmare. So much that I hated the opera. Florez is superb but Natalie is past her prime after her many operations. If you want to see a traditional staging in a Swiss village get the one with the amazing soprano Gueterrez. Now if we can only get Florez together with Gueterrez.
5,Great production,"A very fine modern production of bellinis work. With two of the best singers at thid time, it gives you a very plecent experience"
2,"A Travesty Masquerading As ""A New Production""","My two stars are for Juan Diego Florez who sings his role almost to perfection. But there's little else here to excite a listener or viewer. Natalie Dessay, in my opinion a vastly overrated, frankly homely, pennywhistle coloratura, has neither the beauty nor the commanding, non-goofy acting skills of a Callas on the one hand, nor the supreme vocal beauty of a Sutherland, both women her immediate predecessors in this most demanding role. As to Mary Zimmerman, a slavish imitator of conformist Euro-fashion updatings (our by now stale tradition these days in opera), it's gallant to be silent. This is a performance best allowed to fade into history as a giant misstep."
1,"Fussy, Boring Production","This ""Sonnambula"" has everything to recommend it except genius, wit, and charm. What a disaster!"
4,"Never mind the naysayers, just enjoy.","I don't know, but when I indulge in opera, it's not for the scenery or the production. (I didn't quite dig the recent, controversial staging of Tosca, but that's an extreme case.)Here we have a clever comedienne (a very poised actress) and a tenor with a piercing, rewarding tone. The story may be silly, but you have to love Donizetti.Don't you love it when Dessay the orchestra wait while she puts her costume shoes on, right at the end?"
1,incompatible; poorly made,"These things do not fit a 1995 Ford Ranger v6 3.0L (and probably many other year Rangers, I'd guess). Amazon's make-sure-it-fits-your-vehicle tool failed me 4 out of 5 times (one success, one failure that I recognized before making the purchase, and then three separate failures in a single batch order).Also, these wires are poorly made: the connection points receed into the rubber at both ends, so you have to force them back out, like trying to recover a lost drawstring in a pair of gym shorts.Don't buy them, and don't trust Amazon's make-sure tool."
2,Not a good buy.,These are the worst set of plug wires I have ever bought. They dont want to go on the plugs or the distributor cab. In fact they slide off of the distributor cap so you have to take pliers and squeeze the wire together to get a better connection. I would not recommend these wires at all.
5,great song,"nas did his thing on this underrated classic gem, great use of a james brown sample also."
2,very very bad,"I am an afficianado of all types of spiritual music and I was more annoyed than uplifted by this album. I found the backgrounds to be quite trite (of the same quality as the muzac pop in a lot of Chinese restaurants) and this man's voice is terrible.His half chanting, half singing - is neither, and is not pretty nor uplifting.I much prefer real chant like Krishana Das music. I'm sorry I bought this."
5,Too good to be true,"kudos to Sankarshan das for his brilliant work.The songs bring in a sublime taste that one can hardly find in any other devotional music. If you are looking for music which will elevate you to a higher level of conciousness then this is the one, you found it.Selecting the best track would be a tough choice since each song is a gem in itself, but tracks 1 and 4 especially are my favourites. I would definitely recommend this cd to everyone."
1,Nope,"Poor singing, plastic instrumentation, dogmatic lyrics, sloppy engineering. Sankarshan Das means well and pours his heart into the recording, but this shouldn't have left the congregation. Painfully amateurish at times, 1 Star for the beautiful cover art."
1,An ocean of mercy when I turned off this disc,"This is a painful listen - What it lacks in musicality and professionalism, it fails to make up for with over-weening sincerity. This was a ""wish I hadn't"" for me."
2,goes below average,"Well, I am usually fond of the high intensity performances by those celebrating Krishna consciousness, but this album is rather dull and the voice of the performer is weak, lacking the power of that of Krishna Das and other excellent performers.On the cover you find that this very man performed with a number of trendy musicians of the 60ies (or 70ies), but it is damn sure that he yelled 'yeah-yeah, baby' and other low profile stuff only.Well, it could not have been a major sacrifice to exit from the dirty material world as he certainly had nothing to leave behind."
3,NG Witchcraft,This video was ok but we will recyle it to Salvation Army. Not really worth keeping. If you are bent on seeing it I would suggest renting it at a video outlet.
3,worked great,"This thing worked great over the course of 2 years. When it was time to pull it off because of how dirty it got, it left no marks"
2,Excellent for making your laptop look terrible.,"So my Macbook wrist rest chipped on both sides where the lid closes AND I get oily imprints on the glossy screen from the keyboard, so I figured the Malware Protection Pack was the way to go.It wasn't the way to go. The wrist pad gets dirty quickly (and never comes completely clean), and wears out quickly. Also, the thin strip of the pad that passes right above the trackpad leaves a strange horizontal mark on the glossy screen that is MUCH more noticeable than the oily marks that were there previously (and it is harder to remove).I would just remove it and move on, but when I tried, it was obviously leaving behind a sticky residue (quite contrary to Malware's advertising). Not sure what to do next, other than warn others away from making the same mistake.Oops! Did I say ""Malware?"" I meant ""Marware."""
1,Worked fine until I tried to peel it off!,"I bought this more than two years ago and it stayed on my MacBook Core 2 Duo for all this time. I tried to peel it off today. The top leather-like layer of the pad came off separately, leaving the entire silicon-like adhesive in place. Clearly the adhesive had hardened over the period it stayed on my laptop. Removing this thick and sticky layer of dried up silicon adhesive was a tedious painful project that took me several hours."
2,Not Much Point,I have the discoloration problem on my MacBook as well. I bought the Marware protection pack. It did not peel off. When I took it off I had absolutely no residue (I haven't taken it off the trackpad yet - it proves harder to remove). The problem was that the Marware gets as discolored as the computer. It is easier to clean off the computer with a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.
3,Necessary item; Overpriced,"After watching my wife's MacBook's hand rest area discolor, I became determined to not allow this to happen again. So, when I ordered my new MacBook I ordered the Marware Protection Pack. A $20 investment seemed very reasonable to retain the cosmetic appearance and, therefore, resale value.Pro: Soft vinyl-like material is, well, soft and vinyl-like. The keyboard cover/screen shammy is a brilliant idea. Transfer of oils from the keyboard to screen while the lid is closed isn't considered by the average end user.Con: Price. It's evident when you receive the product that this is not a high-quality item. And, although it may be a reasonable price, it is about $10 too much. Apple consumers are stereotyped as willing to overpay for accessories. As with all stereotypes, there are some truths involved. That doesn't excuse the practice, though."
3,Good accesory,It protects the hand rest area. I would like it to protect the built in mouse button because it gets dirty with use.
2,palm pad keeps peeling,"The left palm pad keep peeling, possibly from the uneven heat.This make the protection pad a lot less useful than one wouldthink, which is most people buy this pack for"
3,Less satisfaction as time goes by,"I agree that there are problems of peeling and dirt collection of the hand cushion, though not too bad to stand for. Currently I stuck two white index cards on each side of the cushion, so that the peeling and dirt problems are solved as you change the cards periodically... But what's the difference from making some changable protector yourself?"
2,Not as expected,"I expected this ""marware"" piece to protect the inside face of the mac book, and it does, however it has two cut outs where the macbook closes down on(where one's wrists rest while typing). This is the area my macbook has acquired the most damage though! Needless to say I would not recommend. Price was outrageous for a piece of soft adhesive irregardless of whether it met one's needs or not."
2,I love Goo Gone,"I bought this protection pack when I got my white MacBook. On my old Powerbook G4, I had a big problem of the keys leaving imprints on the screen, so I was excited about the keyboard cover. I used it for about a month before I realized that it was leaving it's own imprint on the screen. Since I stopped using it, I have no problems with key imprints, so I wouldn't use it.With the wrist pad, I used it for about 8 months before the little strips below and above the trackpad lost their adhesiveness, and it got so bad, I decided to remove the whole pad. I have heard many people say that they removed their pad after a month or two and had no remaining adhesive gunk left behind. This was not what I found. The entire pad left a think layer of gunk that took me about 4 hours and quarter bottle of Goo Gone to remove. I was going to buy a new pad to replace the first one, but after that, I will not be buying a new pad."
3,cleaner looking,"After a few months of use, the keyboard area was really showing signs of wear that were not washing off. This covers them up nicely and looks good to boot. The advertised ""padding"" is not much to speak of, but it does make for a nicer surface texture as I rest my hands. The pad itself seems to scratch and stain easily -- but thankfully the scratch and stain are now on the pad and not my computer, so I suppose the pad is doing its job. I also don't care for the giant MARWARE logo, and the keyboard shammy is rarely found in its intended place, since has to be removed a placed... somewhere in order to use the keyboard. Still, I am glad to have this product and hope that it lasts."
3,Good but not Excellent,It's good but not great because it doesn't look very nice and gets dirty very easy.
2,"Not bad; Not good, either","This book has some good points and bad points; however, there are more bad points than good. Much of the broadsword techniques seem to be for rapier or small sword, this would be somewhat dificult for the Scottish sword. His section on the dirk is too short; there are much more techniques and uses for the dirk. The author obviously doesn't know the pole-arm very vell, at all. Information on the weapons themselves is not accurate."
4,for 12-14,"I read this book over and over as a kid of about 10. I loved it then. Of course, i was 10, and a reader much older then 14 would laugh at this book, i have nothing but fond memories of it."
2,The quality is not there,"These stickers are not as bold at the image, they appear faded and patches of color are missing, not worth the price."
1,Alarm Stickers! These are a rip off!,"These stickers are shipped seperately from any alarm system you order, and the shipping cost is rediculous for a few small stickers. They only stick to the inside of a window, which means you cannot use them on a solid surface such as a door or wall. They were also much smaller than the standard size stickers you usually see. This information is not explained on the description, I think intentionally. The quality of the stickers were very substandard, with specks of printing missing. I should have spent more time researching this purchase. Total Waste Of Money!"
1,Tiny plastic posters,These are very small size posters. Size may be similar to that you seeing in the picture.
4,Good for what it is.,"They look good. They place easily. But, they also tear easily, too. You have to be very delicate with them. I don't know how many thieves will be fooled by it. My guess is less than 50%. Thieves browse the Internet too, and so it is likely a lot of them recognize this decal as being fake. In fact, the best advice I was given was to use genuine security stickers instead which I was also advised was okay with some companies. But, if you want it fake, this looks like it will thwart a good number of attempts. Just remember to be very delicate with them."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE STICKERS,"These stickers DO NOT BUY!!After one week it was window washing day and although these stickers go on the inside of the window a paper towel moist with windex was enough to take the sticker right off the decal adhesive. Now there is just a transparent piece of plastic where there once was ( a week ago) an alarm sticker!If you have not bought them DONT, if you already bought them DO NOT have any (A N Y ) presence of window cleaner and wipe around them.D O! .N O T! .B U Y! .T H E S E! .S T I C K E R S!Bad Form!!"
5,Look professional!,I am glad I ordered these security window/door warnings. There are four in a pack and are easy to apply to a CLEAN surface.
1,security stickers,"If you wipe any kind of liquid on this sticker, it vanishes. Save your money and get something else."
5,Adapted from the Back Cover,"In a single volume, the late Christian financial counselor, Larry Burkett, has compiled all the references to money found in the Bible. This book is divided into two sections. Part One is a topical index and includes all the Biblical references and brief comment on each. Part Two contains complete Scriptural passages in the same order as they occur in the Bible, along with a cross-reference back to Part One.Never before has a more helpful tool been available on this subject. Now pastors, teachers, and every student of the Scriptures can find what the Bible says about finances and material assets...in one place!Larry Burkett was the founder and director of Christian Financial Concepts. In September 2000, CFC merged with Crown Ministries, creating a new organization, Crown Financial Ministries."
2,Quite amusing . . .,"I picked up this book because the title page compares it to Tom Clancy's books, which I love. I have read War God several times in the fifteen years since, but probably not for the reasons the author wished. The story is actually quite good, but the literary devices are . . . astonishing. It is as if the author was paid by the amount of clichéd narrator jokes, repeated dialogue, and parts numbers packed into the book. My favourite is the US Major about to be overrun who when ordering a subordinate to radio for reinforcements manages to mention the model number of the radio. The book reads like it was written to be an über-techno-thriller by an author who has a bad opinion of techno-thrillers. It *is* fun to read, but especially so if your idea of fun is listing and naming all the exaggerated elements of style, cataloguing and ranking the clichés, not to mention paging back 140 pages to check if a ten-line paragraph really was copied word-for-word. It was."
5,Old Times on the Upper Mississippi: Recollections of a Steam,"A mine of information about the ""Golden Era"" of Steamboats on the Upper Mississippi River. One of those rare books that does not leave the reader with more unanswered questions than when one started reading. With no wasted words one gets a real feeling of how it was living between 1840 and 1870 as a ""Riverman"". Along with Charles Edward Russell's ""A-Rafting on the Mississip"" I would recommend it as a base for anyone doing research on the subject. For true adventure lovers it is exciting reading in it's own right..."
5,"Aaargh! Out of print? No, tell me it's not true!","I'm no cook. But this is the prize in my kitchen (an ancient paperback, yellow and torn, with a dozen markers noting the classics, the essentials). I figured I nice new copy would be a treat. Alas."
4,montypythonscrapbook/life of brian,"Having been a Monty Python fan since my 1970's college days, it's always bugged me that there was just one Python book I didn't have. I was very happy to find a copy on Amazon. It's a very large-format book (pages are about 12 by 18 inches). The first half is the script of the film 'Monty Python's Life of Brian, illustrated with stills. It's OK, though I regard LOB as MP's least satisfying movie. More interesting is the second part, the Scrapbook (or Crapbook), with lots of comedy material that was left out of the film plus excerpts from Python members' diaries while on location. The book's only real flaw is it's ""perfect binding"" which, after nearly 30 years, is starting to break up, loosening pages. I guess that's unavoidable. On the whole, I'm dead pleased with it."
2,One Heartbeat,"Not much insight into running a huge organization. After reading this it makes you wonder what Mack Brown does, since Darryl Royal seems to be involved with everything. Almost like the coach is his lackie"
5,OVERRATE & OVERPRICED,"I thought this was the best thing ever! I loved this eyeliner! Until i went to Rite Aid and got LOREAL HIP creme liner for $12.99 ndbought a brush for $3.29, whihc lasted me a year. THis asted me four months and was crap. Save your money!"
4,Interesting area not usually looked at in PKD's work,"Taking a look at the religious aspects of PKD's work shines an interesting pink beam of light on things. The knowledge base of the author across a wide variety of religions allows him to put forth many questions and answers about how/why/meaning of many books from PKD and what greater concerns of higher level he had. PKD used religion in books as varied as MITHC, DADOES to later books such as Divine Invasion and Valis. This pulling together into one source makes it easy to understand how from greek to christion to eastern religions they all fit into his pantheon of work. I'd also look into combining this with a couple of other good books, notably Philip K. Dick: Exhilaration and Terror of the Postmodern by Christopher Palmer and The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick by Lawrence Sutin. All nicely written as well. Pick up the Pink Beams of Light..., and it will shed some illumination on this neglected aspect of PKD's writing."
2,Get what you pay for,"Bought these and the locking mechanism from the start made me question the quality. It was frequently hard to get the key in/out of the locks. I would struggle and fight to get the key in/out. We got one good season out of them. Then this year I put them on the car, and tried using them and the locking mechanism came right out along with the key. Waste of money. I'm going to pony-up and pay for a Thule box!"
5,Great Economy Rack,"Had one of these for 7 years now. Used every year for multiple trips, sometimes fully loaded. Carries 4 boards, stacked, or 6 pairs of skis. Locks need to be maintained annually with a little WD40 to keep them moving smoothly over the years and they will freeze if caked with snow or ice - like any other lock. Previous reviewer must have just gotten a bad one. Two of my friends also have these (or have in the past) and have never had problems with the mechanism either. I have never taken mine off the roof since installation so the mounting bolts are probably not removable now. I would LOVE to buy another one for my other Jeep if I could find one. At $39.99 direct from Coleman (which is what I remember paying back then) it is just a great little rack!"
4,+ 1/2 stars...The Ultimate King of Calypso Collection,"If it weren't for Harry Belafonte, most Americans would have never become aware of calypso music. This generous 37-track collection hits most of the highlights of a remarkable career, including ""Jamaica Farewell,: ""Mary's Boy Child,"" ""Man Smart (Woman Smarter),"" ""Jump in the Line"" and of course his signature song ""The Banana Boat Song."" And while the emphasis is on his calypso and folk material, he also recorded more contemporary material like ""Abraham, Martin & John"" from 1970's BY REQUEST. My only complaint is that instead of using the million-selling single version of ""The Banana Boat Song,"" they used a live version. If you're looking for a solid introduction into the music of Harry Belafonte, look no further. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,Snippets of Harry Belafonte,"I ordered this CD set for two specific songs (Banana Boat and Turn the World Around) in addition to enjoying his voice in general. The music is mellow, I play it while I am working, and yet there is a part of me that is disappointed by some level of superficiality of the music set."
4,great shoe,"It can go with just about anything. Skirts, jeans, shorts. Very comfortable, lightweight and soft. But I did expect a little more padding at the sole. Though thats not to say that its not comfy, just that I expected more."
5,"Great product, better price","These are the same pulls that can be purchased at Lowe's or other retailers for at least double the price. I guess when people face spending thousands on cabinets, they don't care if they get hosed on the little things, but buying these here literally saved us over $100."
1,BORING,"I was hoping for something titilating. Did NOT get that with this DVD. The interviews with the former models weren't interesting either. BORING. This is NOT porn, not instructional, not anything otehr than a sad waste of my time and money. DO NOT BUY IT."
4,Documenting a Phenomena,"Pornography on the Internet has arguably changed the sexual and moral landscape of people world-wide, perhaps more than the sexual revolution of the 1960s. It was also the first category of Internet business to make a profit. Insex was fabulously successful financially, and has spawned dozens of imitators. This film employs interviews and behind-the-scenes shots to document the pioneering, and perhaps the most misogynistic of the hard-core sado-masochism web sites. The film was made by people who have a long-standing relationship with the site and with those who ran it. It offers unique insights into one of the driving forces behind the beginning of a social-sexual change that continues today. This is invaluable for anyone who wants to understand the current evolution of sexual morals. This film is already controversial and difficult to acquire. See it while you can."
5,Journey into the human mind,"I can only agree with the other reviewers, like Amos Lassen.This is a fascinating documentary giving insight into the driving forces behind the INSEX site and the people involved in it.As always, different people have different interest. If you are turned away by some aspects of the human psyche, you should probably consider seeing another of my favorite films; ""Notting Hill"" instead.If, however, you are intrigued by what human beings can not only endure but also enjoy in the right set of circumstances this is your film."
4,Zoo Med 501 Canister Filter Hanger,"After playing around with my filter placement, it makes perfect sense to hang it on the side of the aquarium. I found it essential in completing my setup. Otherwise, the tubes would have been way too short and awkward to function. This hanger should come as part of the filter set, not sold separately."
3,"Great filter, until it died","I have 2 young RES and this filter really does the job of keeping the water in my tank clean. Although my tank still gets mild algae buildup on the rocks, the water remains clean, which is the most important thing. The hoses are long, which is great for larger tanks, and all of the parts seem to be very sturdy. The motor is easily primed and doesn't lose suction if the power goes out. This is a hardworking, quiet filter and great for turtle tanks.UPDATE: This filter died in May 2012. I know that turtles and their amazing waste output really put up a challenge when finding a reliable filter, but I am disappointed in the short length of time this lasted. It did work very well up until it burned out, so I cannot completely pan it--for fish tanks it would probably last much much longer."
2,Good Source Material - Overpriced As Usual,"Good reference work for the practicing esthetician, as there is very little in-print regards ""black skin care"" for the professional costmetologist. However, like all the other books published by Milady, it's somewhat overpriced. Shop around for a used copy, or check it out at your Library, or have your Library do an ""Inter-Library-Loan"" request for you. Whether you buy a copy or check it out from the Library, do make the effort to read it."
3,not as good as the german version,"To everyone who has seen the original german version,this movie is a bit of a let-down.But nevertheless it is vintage Dietrich and one of her most important films,if you want to enjoy this version,please don't be too fussy about the funny way,most of the actors pronounce their english lines."
2,"Not with a bang, but a whimper...","This is the last of the series on the Barone family, but even though there was a resolution, the heroine Maria is not a fitting heroine. She is more interesting and more likable in some of the earlier Barone books. In this story, she is pathetic in her fears, and the storyline drags on. She frets over the same issue (the Conti curse and her family's reaction to her lover) throughout the book instead of facing things. It doesn't take long for her refrain to get tired. Her lover Steven Conti is a more interesting character, but you really wonder why he puts up with her. You realize that the curse would still be in effect because of the baby -- whether she was with Steven or not -- so denying him doesn't even make sense. I was glad things were tied up at the end, but other books in the Barone series were much better."
3,From Back Cover,"HE'D TRACKED HER DOWN......in the snow-covered Montana mountains. But in his runaway lover's glistening eyes Steven Conti could see she still loved him, still wanted him. And from her rounded belly he couls see she hid his unborn baby. Nothing would stop Steven from taking them home to Boston - his woman and his child....From thier first night together, Maria Barone was branded by his kiss; she could belong to no one but Steven. But he was a Conti, and she a Barone - sworn enemies and feuding rivals. Maria wanted Steven, as a husband, a lover, a father to her baby. But could they find happily-ever-after - or had she fallen for the one man she could never keep?12th in Dynasties: The Barones series"
1,Item shipped was mis-represented.,The book I ordered was advertised as new. The one that I received was filled with notations by a previous reader. I was unable to find any means on the Amazon website to report this mis-representation. I was cheated.
5,The book of Enoch with a reprint of the Greek fragments,"The book of Enoch is one book that scares many people.It throws lots of Dogma to the curb.It shows that Angels have their own hell to deal with, it tells of Angels sexual lust for Humans. God isn't refered to as Lord, or Father but as The Great One. One reviewer said in simple terms that because it wasn't in the Canon it's fake! There is evidence that most of the biblical scholars used this book as a study guide. The 100 AD given is a falsehood when stated like that, you would rewrite somthing too if you and two other people were the only ones who could read the book!Space travel is also mentioned when Enoch travels to learns the positions of luminaries and the explanation of the laws of gravity The book opened my eyes and helped me understand and raise some questions about Bible history."
1,Poorly published.,"This book was not typeset by the publisher. It appears that the pages are Xeroxed (and poorly) copies of someone's term paper. The content (what can be read) is excellent, however the extremely poor print quality, makes this book virtually useless as a reference tool as far too many Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic characters are blurred or otherwise illegible."
1,Not part of the canon...,"This book was worth the read, if only to discover why none of the early churches accepted the apocrypha (which includes this book). It is also to note that when the Catholic church DID decide to accept the apocrypha, they did not include this book. The concept of angels marrying humans is not only non-Scriptural, it is down-right heretic. Another problem with this book, is that it could not have been (and was not) written by Enoch as many are led to believe. This book was written around 100 AD. Enoch's time was millenia before! Also, regarding the mention of this book in Jude 14, it was mentioned as an example. Several other Biblical authors mention other books, but this in no way implies that those books are inspired by God; rather they are just used to help confirm, clarify, or illustrate a point. See also: Acts 17:28, 1 Corinthians 15:33, and Titus 1:12 for reference to other non-Scriptural books mentioned within the canon of The True Word of God."
4,At last- great storage capacity,"Having gotten the new 1 gb 45 hour disc mini disc, I am happy because it is now possible to get on one disc what I previously had to spread over 34 standard 80 minute discs. If I want, I can store about 900 songs, or 70 cd's, or save a whole year of voice lessons.Can you imagine how great it is to no longer worry about running out of disk space or having to delete tracks to create space, or using a lot of discs.For $6.99 for 45 hours, this is $0.15 per hour compared to about $1.50 per disc for the standard 80 minute discs, so the value is incredible.If you have an older MD player you may find this HI-MD to be incompatible with that software, so be sure your player is compatible or that you have updated software before buying. My MZN HF800 (reviewed separately) is compatible.I highly recommend this. I hope this review was helpful."
4,The Minidisc Improved,"The Sony HMD1G Hi_MD minidisc is now a little bit more availableand is really a good idea. It is a major improvment on theoriginal minidiscs which only held 60 mins., 74mins., and 80mins.The new one holds just under Eight (8) hours of music or datawhen recorded in the standard play mode. Quite an accomplishmentfor Sony. I have to agree with the other reviewer who opines thatSony does not seem to be making a decent effort to ""sell"" theirproduct. IT is almost as if they want this format to go the wayof ""BETA"" or ""DAT"" One would think that Sony would want torecoup the R+D money invested in this format. I personally thinkthat $6.98 for a disc that holds as much as this one does isa great buy."
3,Hi-MD 1GB MiniDisc is misleading,"The product overall is good. You can store mp3 and pcm files. The only 2 problems I have with this player is that the files are hidden inside Sony's proprietary file system and you cannot upload files twice from the player. The second time it deletes the file from your disc. Beware of Sony's DRM. If you use it for recording interviews and want to convert it to wave files you will be good with the first upload but the second upload deletes your interview and you wouldn't know it until you try to open it again.Pro: Good sound, nice design, great idea and finally support for MP3 (took Sony long enough)Con: Stupid DRM, uses proprietary file system that hides your filesStay away from Hi-MD players until you find a way to extract the files without it being deleted."
3,Unobtanium...,"I have been using a NE410 Net-MD walkman that I got from Walmart 6 months ago and I like the convinience and compactness of it, although it only holds 50 songs per disc with the LP4 codec. I got a NH600 HI-MD Walkman recently and this new technology makes soo much more sence. It can fit 300+ songs on one disc with the 64 Kbps ATRAC3plus codec (that's equal to 128 Kbps in MP3 quality). I can fit all 200+ of my CD's on 5 HI-MD discs.The thing I don't like right now is that Sony, as usual sold millions of players, and only a small handfull of recordable discs for them, so you're stuck bidding on ebay, or waiting on backorder from the vendors. Plus the 10 pack of HI-MD discs are only sold in Canada, whats up with that?"
5,Very Happy,This cable works fine. No degredation of sound. This is an expensive cable but the quality is good and matches the Grado ear phone.
2,Grado Headphone Extension Cable,"I bought this cable after reading all the reviews I could find. I noticed that the vast majority of reviews were written by Grado headphone owners. Everybody felt there was no sound degradation. I had been using a homemade cable made from Belden 14 Gauge 3 conductor lamp cord. I also have a Radio Shack cable that was $7.99 15 years ago. Imagine my surprise when both of the old cables sounded better than the Grado. My only thought is that the headphones I'm using are an impedance mismatch. They are: Sennheiser 580, 600, and 414. Anyway, this cable didn't work for me YMMV."
5,Grado Extension Headphone Cable,Good sturdy cable. You will more than likely have to purchase adapters depending on the size of your jacks. A good purchase.
4,Nice Cable,This cable is slightly thinner than the stock lead on my Grado325is cans. It adds plenty of extra length with no degradation in sound quality. Can't really ask for more than that.
3,doesn't live up to its potential,"Herman starts off with a promising theme: the first woman president, torn between her emotions and realpolitik. The author does well by the emotions but poorly on the realpolitik. He has China acting contrary to its historical behavior and in ways that are simply counterproductive to its own national interests. Herman also fails to understand our treaty obligations with Japan. His characterization of US-Japanese ties are way off the mark. I know this is a book of fiction but the genre of international intrigue requires some basis of fact."
4,"Power, international intrique and military aviation all in 1","If you like Dale Brown, you'll love this book. Contains the power struggles in Washington focused around the White House, Pentagon, and personalities. On the aviation side, a good read as well. If you like reading high tech espionage books with ample doses of power, intrigue and war, this book is for you. A perfect book to take along on a vacation. Others have commented that Herman wasn't factual with the aviation, the Washington power struggles, and I think he could have closed the story a little better. I don't know about you, but I read to relax, and this one was a fun read. I couldn't wait to get a few moments to take in another chapter or two. I loved it!"
3,"Come on Maddy, Make a move!","What a peace-nik. Not that that's all bad, but when you don't go to war, because you don't want your son to become a pilot in 15 years. Come on Dick?!? Richard Herman, a former pilot, was probably much better in a plane (I hope). This would've been a great story to sit around and hear him tell in a bar somewhere, but the book just made me want to slap the president. (ok, so I guess it is like real life) I would never recommend NOT reading a book, but if you've got a choice you may want to put this on the back burner for when you can't find anything else to read."
5,Effective tool for employee groups with different styles,Simple and effective explanation of varied styles between managers and employees. Employs a summary of some great research presented in a simple and easy to understand format. It will teach all levels of staff to respect each other in a completely different way and learn how to communicate more effectively.
2,walker tray,The tray did not fit securely. It teetered back and forth so we didn't use it. We have two walkers and we tried it on both but it didn't fit either. We would have returned it but we threw out the box and the return policy required us to return it in it's original packaging.
1,"Does not fit ""ANY STANDARD WALKER""",I purchased this item for my father and it is unusable because it does not fit his standard walker as the item description and label states. The openings on the sides are not long enough to accommodate standard walkers. People need to use walkers due to lack of stability. This product is not compliant with the needs of users because it requires delicate balancing to remain in place.
5,Wonderful product,i bought this walker tray for my Dad and he loves it !! Very easy to pop it on and take it off and it has made him so much more independent.
5,Five Stars Video!!,"This video truly deserves five stars. It is a super TMNT video. I have loved the TMNT since the 1980s. This is a super show. This video is my favorite out of all of the TMNT videos released. Which is funny because Leonardo isn't my favorite turtle Michaelangelo is my favorite turtle. My favorite episode on this tape is Leonardo Vs. Tempestra, which is the second episode on this tape. Leonardo Vs. Tempestra is my favorite episode out of the TMNT series. Leonardo Vs. Tempestra is the reason that I bought this video. If you have not seen this video I suggest buying it right now."
1,Just didn't work.,I have bought many Canon products in the past and have never had a problem until now. This machine copied fine but the fax function worked only about half the time. I checked everything and called customer service and talked to the most condescending rep I have ever dealt with who just insisted that the machine was fine and I was the problem. I wanted to send the machine in for a replacement but he refused (I had it for just 2 weeks) so I hung up the phone and threw the thing in the trash. I went to Costco and got a Brother fax which works great.
4,FAX/phone/answering all in one,"It's good, it wasn't/isn't that easy to set up but it works well and was a good deal"
2,Useless when paper stops feeding,"I use this mainly for an office phone with the occasional incoming or outgoing fax, or to make a few copies. It worked OK to begin with, although the phone quality is not great. But it's extremely touchy about what kind of paper you feed, and finally (after 6 months?) it wouldn't feed any kind of paper--so I can't send faxes or copy anything. I think it still receives faxes, but it ran out of ink quickly. At least, I think it's out of ink; I can't test it, because it won't copy. Tech support was responsive, but their response was that there was no solution other than taking it somewhere to be fixed, which can't be cost-effective. So although this wasn't an expensive machine, it turned out to be a waste of money."
1,hate this fax machine,I bought this fax machine and it drives me up the wall. I am going to get rid of it and buy another one. You get what you pay for...
2,smells like PlayDoh -- wish it smelled like the Nubian Heritage soap instead,"I bought this lotion hoping it smelled like the African Black Soap by Nubian Heritage. Their soap smells amazing. However, this lotion smells just like PlayDoh. Weird. Who would want to walk around smelling like PlayDoh? Not me.This lotion is very thick -- it is not easy to squeeze some out of the opening in the cap -- remove the cap to get some out of the bottle. The lotion feels very soothing to dry skin, and absorbed well, with no residue. I wish is smelled better"
1,Worse book I've ever read,"I couldn't even read this whole book (I read through half of it in high school) because it didn't sound anything like English. The autobiography of Malcolm-X (my favorite book) is way better than this, because it talks about a real struggle not some BS struggle against people of the same race for stupid reasons. In the book he talks about beefs in the hood etc... and how he rose from being an inner-city drug dealer to being a big time rap star. Don't get me wrong his music/rapping is good (not as good as 2pac like a stupid lady told me once ""He's gonna be the next 2pac"")if you want something that will put you to sleep then read this book, if you want something that will make you a real man read the autobiography of Malcolm-X."
2,50 is a good rapper,"50's book tells a few chatty stories about his past, but he's also revealed most of this is various interviews, including the one in Playboy. But with everyone jumping on the 'Queens drug dealer' and 'sleazy tabloid' bandwagons, readers are stuck with nothing but things like this or the Superhead book. If anything the new Run-DMC book Raising Hell was a better value for the money. better written, filled with info I hadn't seen anywhere else, Raising Hell rises above the quick-written trash and tells one of the more important stories about hip-hop and one worth reading."
4,A MUST READ.......,"This is a MUST READ for everybody who just doesn't understand 50's mentality. He really takes us into his world and breaks things down for the reader. I like how he showed us his weaker moments. He did not hesitate to tell us when he was scared, confused and defeated. I definately have a better understanding of where he got his bravado. 50's life is also a message to anyone who feels like quitting.This book made me feel sorry for him and laugh as well. I am so proud of him and all the other young men who made it out!! I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO HIS NON-FANS AS WELL!!!I only gave it 4 stars because I would like to know what his relationship is like now with his family."
5,"Intense, Interesting and Exciting all in one!","I really didn't know what to expect when I first picked this book up. I will admit I'm some what a fan of 50's music which did influence me a little bit in buying this book. The way he explains himself in his story almost makes you feel apart of it. He does a fine job of being descriptive and getting the message he wants to get across. I would say to anyone who is a fan, likes music or just wants to read about someone who has gone from nothing to something, read this book. It's inspirational to see what someone has gone through to get to the top. Nothing is easy in life, and if you need some motivation just read his story."
4,ggggggggggggggggggg gunit,"wow i never really read book but, his story was very interesting, i counld'nt stop reading,i am also a g-unit fan though, i would of gave it five star if he included tony yayo and lloyd banks more in the story, but other than that ths book was good"
5,Simply stunning,"Cobra verde can be considered one of the best films of the great German director Werner Herzog.With amazing images, principaly in its disturbing and superb end, it portraies with extreme sensitivity the typical passions of the human being, as the insatiable craving for power. Of course, everything is shown with the extremely touching ""touch"" of Werzog. In short, the film shows before everything that, as it says cobra verde(francisco manuel da silva), the slavery inhabits in the human heart. A masterpiece simply Fantastic !"
3,Herzog does a spaghetti western in africa,"Good Movie full of lush scenery and color about a bandit who beomes a slave trader on the coast of Africa, starring an out of control Klaus Kinski, As Herzog said Kinski brought something offensive to this film that the director didn't like.. Herzog would have liked to have shot the final scene first to drain Kinski and settle him down. as Herzog said, the film is unfinished and there are shots he'd rather take out. I didn't get the topless native girls singing and the hunchback dwarf cantina scene but it's a Herzog film it's a grand metaphor for something! you don't see much happen til a wide eyed raving Kinski leads the amazon warriors to battle but the end result is disappointing check out how fast a 60 year old plus Klaus can move tho."
3,KInski and herzogs final film together!,"I thought the film started a little slow,but quickly this movie picks up momentum and ends in a big explosion! KLaus Kinskis acting in this film is absolutely brilliant and manically ferocious! Kinski makes us all believe that he is the revered bandit ,Cobra Verde! When Kinski charges past the sacred snake on the ground to kill the african king, we see the rage in his face and voice and we cheer him on,go Cobra verde! This film also has some of werner herzogs best cinematography,comparable to Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo. A lasting collaboration between 2 film giants of world cinema!"
3,A very minor Herzog,"Let's admit it: Herzog is God. But God also does uninteresting things sometimes, and here is the example. However, the very last scene of the film is breathtaking."
5,Refreshing and new!,Generations is one of the best new contemporary jazz CD's I've heard in a long time. It stands out head and shoulders above other CD's in its category.
2,What happened with recent complexity?,"This book is a big disappointment. In a 800- hundred pages volume one would expect to find the main ideas of the hot area of complexity. Most of the recent results obtained over the last 10 years are not there. Not a single word on criticality and scaling, modelling of random networks, the implications of critical phenomena to complexity, or the recent approaches to evolutionary dynamics. Even those problems already presented in other monographs (as pattern formation in biology) do not receive an adequate attention to those interested in complexity issues. Save your money."
2,A Collage of Previous Work?,"This is a simplistic, out of date treatment of a diverse and rapidly changing field. It is a disappoint that Bar Yam failed to capture the depth of the field, instead offering a cursory look at, mostly, classical examples in which Bar Yam did not take part. I would prefer, instead, to see a leader in the field write such a text, such that I could be assured that details that were omitted were less relevant, not simply forgotten."
5,Every feature you can imagine . . .,"This is a thoughtful, comprehensive guide to create your own journal. I have a daughter and two small grandchildren who will get to know more about me. And, it's all organized for me to use. I wish my parents had the chance to write such a book. Everyone should buy it and use it. Give it to family and friends. I have purchase several and given them."
5,Amazing bang for the buck,It doesn't get much better than Grado...the cans of choice in my studio...great sound and great quality...who could ask for anything more...
2,Cute but flimsy,"We got this stroller for our three year old daughter at Christmas. She loved playing with it. However, the thing constantly collapsed because the clips that hold the frame open would slip off. Finally, after just a few months, the frame (aluminum) broke right in two leaving sharp metal edges. This occured during normal play. She did not play with it in an overly rough fashion and she was not allowed to sit in it. Especially for the amount of money we paid for it, we were very disappointed in this stroller. Since then we have found a Graco doll stroller that is much more sturdy and does not collapse."
5,Great stroller! Granddaughter loves it!,"I bought this cute stroller for my two year-old granddaughter after looking at a lot of different doll strollers. This one really holds up to tough play. An important note is that the stroller is a good height. Since my granddaughter is on the taller side for a toddler, many of the baby strollers I looked at before I decided to purchase this one were just too short! This is easy for her to push, and every doll she puts into it fits, too. The basket on the back of the stroller is a generous size and sturdy as well. A solid five stars! Great price, great stroller!"
2,Bouncing baby buggy,The wheels broke the first day with my 18 month old grandaughter. She still loves to push it around even when it's skidding. Cheap price but to cheap to fix.
3,Sweet stroller for her mini-me,"Other than the color on the site displayed as more lilac than cotton candy pink (its real color), I'm pretty happy with this stroller. My 2-year-old pushes it all over the house and attempted even to sit in it and the fabric didn't rip. The basket is super small and the front wheels are a bit wonky. They don't turn as well as we'd like. It's collapsable and lightweight, though, perfect for indoor play. I'm not sure that the wheels could withstand much else."
2,Disappointing long-term use,"This stroller was everything that my daughter wanted: pink, flowery, lightweight, foldable. However, it fell apart after a few months of gentle wear and tear. I have now upgraded to a much more expensive, but much more durable Chico baby buggy. Would not recommend if you plan to get good long-term use out of this toy."
4,Very cute,I ordered one for a gift and liked it so much I ordered another for another gift.It even has a sunroof!
1,very light weight.,"pretty colors,my baby loved it, but very light weight, flipped closed all the time, my baby tripped with it all the time during the two days that she used it. very cheap material, I think it will break soon. I returned it immediately.I give credit to the seller , they offer free return."
4,For my granddaughter's baby doll..,This was the perfect stroller toy for my granddaughter's second birthday. She was strolling her baby doll and her stuffed animals around the house. Good choice for a 2 year old girl...
3,doll stroller,i order three of these doll strollers veery light wt. and tip very easily with toddler use.
2,Look for better,"Even though I am a fan of the Calphalon cutlery line (I really think they beat the pants off of the German competition), this block leaves a lot to be desired. The block that came with my 15 piece set was pretty nice, and I ordered this block to house the additional knives that I bought. It appears to be the same design, but the quality control is awfull. Several glue joints were split open when I recieved the block, and the finish was not quite up to par. Given the low cost, I chose to glue and clamp the block into submission, rather than to send it back, but you might be better off buying a more expensive block to start with."
4,Not perfect,Plenty of room for all knifes of all shapes and lengths. Good construction. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the kitchen shear slot. To small.
4,"Good little light, radio and charger","Good little radio, charger and led light.It has a usb port that you can charge your ipod or phone. Too bad it did not come with any adapters. Pros-Ease of use, accepts AA batteries to supplement the crank charge batteries.Con- No adapters aside from a wall unit that will not work if the power is out. The light is okay.All in all, I think its a good unit for the price."
1,beware,"purchased in january. bad weather came in march and it would not work. won't hold a charge,weather alert does not work, charge light stays on and radio will not shut off with switch, volume is too low.the reviews i read before my purchase seemed to range from very good to terrible. i thought i would take a chance and lost the gamble. they seem to have no consistent quality control. it is too late to return to amazon so i will try factory warranty."
1,Not dependable,"Product was bought in April of 2011, and used after recomended charging. Used to check weather in August of that year then put back on shelf. Took it out a couple days ago during severe thunderstorm and the radio no longer works. Re-read instructions and called Midland customer service. I followed their advice and it still didn't work, called back and the basically told me too bad. This radio sat on a shelf and was used twice for under an 1/2hour total."
2,cranking is a waste,"My unit failed to charge with crank mechanism. Otherwise the unit worked using store bought batteries. Therefore, I give it a 2 star rating. Since the cranking charges built in batteries I am assuming I received old stock"
3,A bargain that Works But NO cell phone charger or tips included,"This is a bargain that actually works, and that is rare these days! I feel safer having this on hand for that next emergency. However, there wasn't any cell phone charging cable or tips enclosed with this radio. I would like to have a charger that works with this radio and can't seem to find the correct item."
1,Total Junk,"I bought four of these radios last year to give as gifts. None are still working, 100% failure rate! They lasted about 6 months."
2,Not for Emergency,"This is NOT a product for emergency situations. First, the power ON switch is so puny you can't find it in the dark - you have to grope for it. Second, the AM tuning is so ""subtle"" it needs the neurosurgeon's skills to set on the desired frequency."
5,Excellent weather radio,These are great keep the rechargeable battery charged up and install alkalines too. Easy to use and setup. I like that I can have weather and local radio as well. Great investment if you live in tornado alley or anywhere for that matter. Midlands are the best!
3,Midland Emergency Radio,"The first radio I received was defective and wouldn't do ANYTHING, but Amazon was very quick to replace it. Kudos to Amazon for their easy replacement policy. However, the second one has problems also, but they don't affect the way I'll be using it. The power adapter is supposed to recharge the ni-cad batteries, but it doesn't, so I'll be using it during power outages with AA batteries. The hand-crank DOES charge up the ni-cads, but only for as long as you crank it. Don't think I'll be using IT. :) Overall, it seems like a good product. Good reception and good selection of weather channels."
1,Died after 1 month,"Six weeks after I purchased this item it began to stutter when I turned on the radio, and soon after stopped working all together. As another reviewer mentioned the quality control on this item appears to be hit or miss."
2,Poor AM Tuner,"Don't buy this radio for a good AM tuner. It looks like a digital tuner, but it may be a simulated digital tuner, or a really bad digital tuner. The crosstalk (overlap) of stations can run as much as 60KHz. In other words, if you tune to a local station at 730KHz, you can hear it loud at 650-820KHz, or so. This blanks out the other stations in this range. Also,if you are listening to a station at 730KHz, you probably can hear 3-4 other stations in the background. You would think that the unit would be s a good radio first. My free analog AM radio I got with a purchase as a promotion, is perfect. I thought the digital AM would be too, but it's not even close. Otherwise, the unit is OK."
2,Didn't cost much and that's about what it's worth,"Poor tadio reception. Didn't include the USB cable to charge a cell phone. Tuning radio is difficult. Tuning knob is small, volume knob is huge. Dial backlights nicely but you can't see the markings for the knob and slide switch selections."
1,Useless purchase.,Worked for 5 weeks. Sent for warranty repair. Received replacement which did not work at all. Seller & manufacturer absolved themselves...refused refund. No customer consideration in terms of this being a gift. Future buyers beware!
2,Product failed after 3 months.,"This product failed to work after about 3 months of casual use. All functions are failing. Up to that point, it performed ok. It looks like we are past the amazon refund/return period so now I will have to go to Midland to see what they will do."
4,Good product,After reading many reveiws I picked the Midland 102. I bought this for my husband for Father's Day since he has been wanting an emergency radio. He is very happy with this radio so far.
4,Nice radio,"Nice features. So far so good. At first, didn't get weather service alerts, but seems to be getting them now."
3,Glad I bought this,"This radio worked great during the two and a half days we went without power, thanks to Hurricane Irene.My only major complaint with the radio is with the charging setup, or at least the charging instructions. Namely the instructions stating that ""to charge with the AC adapter, ensure the power source switch is in the 'AC/Dynamo' position"".The problem being that the ""AC/Dynamo"" position, is also the ""ON"" position for the radio. Meaning that according to the instructions, you have to have the radio on in order for the batteries to charge.The charging light still comes on even if you don't have the switch in the ""AC/Dynamo"" position, but I haven't tested it to see if the battery is charging or not....."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"As the other reviewers have said...reception is not that good. I live in an area with alot of radio stations and if you have a few close on the dial they bleed into each other.The weather alerts are ALWAYS going. No matter if its a clear day there is an alert of some kind, so if you have the alarm on it goes.And discovered this weekend, if you leave it out in the sun it will heat up very quickly and not work...so has to be covered to protect it.You either listen to the weather reports non stop or you use it as a radio, no in between. I would not purchase this one again."
3,Can't compare to CCrane Observer for sensitivety..,"The Midland ER102 is an average radio with average sensitivety and sound..I consider the CCrane Observer a clear step ahead in all areads where they can be compared directly...The ER102 does have alarm functions for time and weather alerts which many will find necessary...Those alarm features weren't necessary for me...It's all about preference...Bottom line, the CCrane Observer picked up AM and weather stations better and the speaker has a much richer tone...The ER102 is tinny...The cranking time is comparible but the handle on the ER102 is thinner and more likely to break...Overall the ER102 is an average quality radio whereas the CCrane Observer is of higher quality...kd"
2,A little to be desired,"The reception on both AM & FM is lousy and full of static, with stations over-riding eachother. I wouldn't recommend this radio to anybody."
1,It looked good but .......,"I liked the features on this radio and didn't hesitate to buy it despite some negative reviews. I assumed the manufacturer would correct the problems. When I got the unit home, I was pleased with what I got. It had the features and it also seemed to be sturdy. I charged the batteries as they instructed and used it 24 hours later. It worked well initially but broke down quickly after that. The tuner was out of whack and could not be tuned in. I am lucky to having bought it from Amazon and they refunded me without hesitation. In this case Midland loses but Amazon wins. They (Amazon) stand behind their products. I will be doing even more purchases through Amazon because of the guarantee."
2,"Poor design, not sure if it is working correctly or not.",I thought it was really cool getting it out of the box. Worked for about a day or so. Now I can leave the unit plugged into the wall and it's not charging. Something doesn't work right with how the battery pack charges. And forget about cranking for power. It only lasts a few seconds. Wouldn't buy it again. Wish I had something else in all the severe weather we've had lately. Cannot rely on this product for alerts.
1,Good for a week,This radio worked fine for a week then an alarm kept going off. Could not find a way to shut the alarm off. The alarm kept going off every 15 minutes. Had to wrap it in towels and stick it in my shop so I could get some sleep. Then the clock on it messed up. The minutes go to 40 the jump to 00. I am waiting to get a response from the Midland radio company.
1,Save your money!,"I bought this unit with the highest expectations. I've used Midland products for almost 30 years but this thing stinks. It worked ok at first but the instructions were terribly written and the controls are not very intuitive. After 2 months it wouldn't play anything but FM. And worst of all, was their customer service. I tried to contact Midland twice and never got a response. They lost a customer on this one."
1,crap,"This radio will definitely keep the battery stores alive uses them like crazy. Also the internal rechargeable with the ""crank"" is pretty much useless. Wish I'd never bought it."
4,"Great radio, but:",The Midland ER102 radio that I purchased from Amazon works great. It is everything as advertised. The sound is great for such a small speaker. The only problem that I have found with the radio is the location of the on/off switch for the LED light. My finger hits the switch when I grab the strap to pick up the radio and turn on the light. I am now aware of this and check the light whenever I pick up the radio. Outside of that minor item I am very pleased with my purchase.
3,Works Well But Missing Something,The alert does not work in the event of an emergency. I would have been better off buying the Midland $30 base radio from a local grocery store. Satisified with all other features.
1,Mine broke down,It would not be working for me when I need it should I have not checked on it. I have to replace it with another brand now.
4,Weather radio,It seems to work as advertised. The weather station comes in loud & clear and the radio is nice. We travel in an RV and bought it so we would have access to severe weather alerts in our travels. I trust it will alert us in case of a tornado or other bad weather. So far I like it a lot and its comforting to know we have this protection even though we haven't had to really use it yet.
4,"Good emergency radio, battery use a bit much.","Well built, solid reception, easy to use. No complaints except that the rechargeable battery seems to go dead rather quickly, even when I keep the AA's in the radio as well. I have to charge the radio every other week or so even when I'm not using it, and it drains the AA's as well. The radio is not on alert mode, which I know can drain the batteries rather quickly. Maybe I need to replace the rechargeable battery pack.Solid performer, but needs to be charged regularly if you want it available for an emergency. I prefer the solar capability of the Ambient Weather Adventurer, which I put on a window sill and forget about charging it."
3,"Fair, not Great","Fair emergency radio. Noaa weather radio is the best feature, along with the 3 LED light. am fm radio tuning is finicky at best. Reception on am and fm is fair at best. Noaa weather radio reception is again great. Controls are stiff to operate. Speaker sounds like tin."
1,Not recommended,"I purchased this radio in August 2011. It sits on my kitchen counter, and I use it every day. 110 volt-plugged in. Yesterday, the radio decided to die. It would play for 30 seconds, and then the reception would cut in and out, and the display would go batty, switching back and forth between all the available displsys it has. I have been told that it plays for 30 seconds and then goes crazy, because at the 30 second point, some electrical component overheats or fails to work, resulting in no radio for me.My kids are all adults, it is just my husband and I, and this radio has been babied. It has never experienced extreme conditions.I Cannot recommend itMidland ER102 Emergency Radio with NOAA Weather, and will not buy another to replace this one. I will try to contact the company, and if they help me, I will amend that to this review. Right now, I have to say, don't waste your money :/ I gave it one star because ""no star"" was not an option."
1,NiCad battery won't charge,"I bought 3 ER102 emergency radios from Amazon and none of them will charge the internal battery. The adapters have power (I checked with a volt meter) and the internal batteries will hold a charge if I hand crank them. But when I plug in the power adapters, the red ""charging"" light never comes on. I've swapped out the radios and chargers to isolate a bad unit, but all of the radios won't charge from the adapter. I emailed Midland and they will take them back for repairs (but I have to pay shipping). They replied promptly, to their credit. We'll see what happens when I ship them back."
1,Item was broken when received,The AM FM did not work at all. Everything else seemed to function fine but whats the use if you can't even get a local AM station. The manufacturer took a week to respond and then basically just said to return it where you got it. No other help was provided. The flashlight was worthless.
3,Ok for emergency use.,"I bought this radio to have on hand for an emergency if the power fails, disaster etc. It does what it says and I pulled it out of the box to give it a try.It does have a USB port in the back under the rubber flap that the AC charger plugs into. I did try and use it to charge my iPhone to see how it worked. It will only charge while you are cranking the handle at a fairly vigorous pace, I guess if the power was out and you wanted your cell phone to work you could charge it, I just hope you have a few people with you that can also crank as it gets tiring pretty fast.The Crank handle seems a like it is a litle on the flimsy side and may not last very long if used a lot.The radio dial is a bit touchy but stations can be tuned in, you just have to be light on the knob."
4,It works !,I bought this to replace an Eton FR300. No amount of cranking on the Eton would give me more than a few minutes of use. The Midland after a few minutes of cranking lasts for days. I still recommend the AC adapter for a full charge. It also has better reception of weather channels.
1,Very disappointed,"Not a great product.Likes. Nice size, controls work ok.Dislikes. Sound quality is poor. AM reception is pathetic. Charger quit working after three months so into the garbage it go's.China junk..."
5,weather radio,"Living rural, wanted something for a warning and am very happy with this radio.If I want I can listen to weather all day, not necessary becasue it automatically goes to weather when it is bad."
3,"Not what I expected, but does the job","I have a weather radio for my home, but I bought this as a radio to go in our emergency bag. This doesn't really work well for that purpose because it has a clock display that is ALWAYS using power (there is no way to turn the display off). So I keep this plugged up NEXT to the emergency bag - not exactly what I had in mind. However, this radio is far superior to the one it is replacing that picks up NO stations (well maybe one fuzzy local country station). This radio actually picks up a weather station and all the regular radio stations. So it will work, but just not exactly what I was hoping for."
5,This is a must have in all emergency kits.,I bought this after tornados took half the homes in our area. Everyone should have one of these radios. When you buy Midland products your buying the best. You get what you pay for.
4,Easy manageable size. Reviews are very small.,"I also own a stack of other film encyclopedias but for weight and manageability this is the best of the lot. The book is around 2 inches thick - but is the size of a novel and you can hold it in one hand. It is a full resource (with over 18,000 titles!), easy to carry around and has a full listing of directors and cast at the back along with Oscar winners. Overall the reviews are not very good and they are limited to just four of five lines at best. I mostly do not use it for the reviews though. It is more of a ""find a director or star that you like and quickly flick through the index and the corresponding works to see what else they have done"". For that it is very impressive but if you are looking for in-depth reviews then you should go elsewhere for the more unmanageable volumes and Arnold Schwarzenner to help carry them around for you."
5,Mary A Larkin,"I had read all of the books written by this author several years ago but just repurchased them again, they are well worth a second reading. Great story lines. and very factual."
1,We are all one leg size,"I'm a big guy with short legs. I take a 27"" inseam. My uncle Henry though had a 40+ inseam (7"" 6""). This site only give you the option of 30 or 32"" inseam. How comes.David"
5,Track List,"Track Listing1. When She Loved Me2. Music From The Heart3. Life Is Beautiful4. You'll Be In My Heart5. When You Believe6. Beautiful Stranger7. Star Wars Theme And Arriva At Naboo8. World Is Not Enough, The9. Save Me10. Hymn To The Fallen11. Baby Did A Bad, Bad Thing12. American Woman"
3,ENJOYABLE BUT FLAWED,"I agree it is well plotted and combines history, politics and exotic locations but I have some reservations: I am uneasy about the way he mixes fiction with real history and real people, eg Lloyd George and Churchill, inventing a conversation with the latter in 1950. His writing style can be flat and cliched, and the central figure, the historian from whose point of view the book is written, is rather colourless. It relies on the discovery of diary/memoirs, which are full of dialogue, which is unlikely. Still, the plot carries you forward to unravel the central mystery."
4,Past Caring,"Past Caring is the first novel by Robert Goddard that I've read...loved it. Great story, interesting characters (Edwin and Elizabeth in particular), historical intrigue, nice pacing...extremely well written. I immediately purchased In Pale Battalions to read next. Highly recommended."
5,Outstanding! My Favorite Novel,"The other reviewers have given an accurate picture of this book. The plot twists are literally breath taking! Goddard's best. I hope the publisher reissues this book in hardcover ,I would buy it in an instant. This is one of five book I give a 10 rating."
4,Wonderful,"This has to be one of Robert Goddard's best.... The reader is hooked from page one, a page turner of first order. This does exactly what you want from a great book - it sucks you in and before you know it the day has melted away and you're lost in the pages. You're driven to keep turning pages to know how the story develops. Goddard proves himself as a superb storyteller.It's easy to be a bit more critical with his more recent works, but here I can only express my admiration for his work. He is really on top of his creative capabilities.Comment"
5,A must own,"I have raised Gouldian Finches and own a Rose Breasted Cockatoo, Umbrella Cockatoo, Love Bird and Conure. This book has been indispensable for all of them. Whenever someone adopts my babies, I have recommended they get this book in order to maintain optimal health for the new family members. I have used the homeopathic, herbal and Bach flower remedies on the various birds and have had good results. My birds are healthier and happier due to the knowledge dispensed in this book."
1,Rainforest? These Guys Leave No Rainforest Behind!,"Well, as soon as our species can survive on information rather than calories, this book MIGHT be of some use.In the meantime, I find it a questionable, if not pathetic, apologia for megalomaniacal outfits like Coca Cola. Coke is a leader among the pack of those who apparently share a neverending pseudo-quest to combine illusory humanitarianism (""Coca-Cola does a great service because it encourages people to take in more and more liquids"") with an unquenchable thirst for global market dominance (""until, eventually, the number one beverage on Earth will be soft-drinks-our soft drinks"").Can we contemplate the notion that 'unlimited growth' and 'sustainability' just might be mutually exclusive? Look up Ecological Economics, my friends. I beg you."
2,Poor modeling,"I've bought more than a few excellent books, and more than a few bad ones. For the price they are asking, it should belong to the former catagory. You would think they would have some ""guest"" artists featured in this book, some who have made great looking models. One look at the cover (something I failed to do before buying) shows a few uglies that would fit right in a horror story, but not most animation. The models don't get much better on the inside. If you want to learn the material inside, start with a traditional drawing book -- it's much cheaper than most books on 3D, and more thorough. For lip sinc, try Digital Character Animation 2, volume 1, by George Maestri. I'm not buying another book by Bill Fleming, he doesn't have his act together."
3,Too many pictures too little tutorials,"For Lightwave 3D and Magpie users this book covers Human facial expressions (also a comic fish), with a lot of pictures , actually too many of them . The author could have used some space to give hands on step by step tutorials for the actual face animation process, also not mentioned is Morph Gizmo an essential Lightwave plugin for facial animation. Buy this book if you like to have a complete picture library of facial poses."
2,Cheap...,"This game sucks... It has the most horrible graphics in the world, and the games arn't that much fun... The only good thing is that it is something to do..."
3,Samsung phone case,The phone case was good however it took almost 3wks to recieve!!! We again purchased a differant case for a differant phone through the same seller and took just as long if not longer.I would shop somewhere else next time!! We just bouught one off ebay and got it in 4 days!!! AWSOME!!!!!
2,Not my thing,"I tried to like this, but I was expecting more Taj. I'll keep it and maybe it will grow on me."
3,Such a pretty shoe,"This sandal is undeniably gorgeous but more uncomfortable at first than any other sandal I've ever owned. For what it's worth, if you live anywhere hot or humid and your feet get warm when you walk, it makes those squishy fart noises at first too."
5,Fast shipping and cheaper!!!!,I got this for my daughter's b-day. I bought them from the store before. But I did it through amazon this time and I'm very glad I did it. Shipping was fast and the price was great!!!!
3,An okay book but...,This strategy guide is a pretty good strategy guide althought it really doesn't tell you if you need to do this if it is a major thing. You also can't read just to see if you are doing something right because it spoils the rest of the scence. Besides that it is a good Guide. It could have better maps. And it has an okay list of of all the characters.
2,"God book, but (no matter what others say) spoilers GOTTA GO!","This was actually the most impressive guide Prima has done in a while. Tells where/how to get each of the 108 stars, full maps (thank you!), strategies, and even lists which foods are best and worst during the cookoffs! However... the spoilers, which Prima has become famous for, are littered throughout this book. You can pick up the strategy guide and just read it instead of playing the game... the experience is quite similar! And no, a game guide does -not- need spoilers to be great... look at any Versus Books strategy guide, and you can tell that. So please Prima... make us gamers happy and get rid of the spoilers! It is -not- that hard (and to read about someone's death/betrayal/killing another/whatever in game is annoying!!)"
2,Nice text but not graphics,"The content of this book is good for boys. The actual edition does not display the graphics.Without the figures, the book is very limited."
2,Be Careful!,"Amazon does not apparently realize this but it has lumped together three versions of this book that are quite different.1. The original hard cover book. It is the one depicted in the look-inside feature. I haven't seen an original in years, but as a child it was one of my favorite electric experimentation books. It got me started with electrical experimentation. A great book.2. The reprinted modern copy. Paperback, appears to come off a copier someplace when you place an order. Not very durable, but more importantly -Lacks all illustrations- good luck understanding it, or interesting anyone in reading it. WorthlessI rated a 2, as the original is a 4, and the reprint a 1."
1,black chipped off handles; threw out,"These are cute, but they are not well made, they are uncomfortable, and after several use/washings, the black paint chipped off, sometimes falling into my food while I used these. I threw them out."
2,Keep coming apart,"I guess they cut as well as any kitchen shears, but I find that they regularly come apart into two pieces. That's probably good for cleaning, but annoying when you use them. I also find the grip is not very comfortable (and I have small hands!). I bought them separately (not a part of a set)."
3,ok,I don't know how well the sensor work since I just found out I have the california model. I need to get some stricter sensor.
1,Not meant for Honda Accord,"I received this item and it isn't the correct O2 Sensor for the Honda Accord ULEV. You actually need the Denso 234-9014, which is $200-250. This didn't fix my problem. CE light is still on since this isn't the right part."
5,It worked.I Solved my P0420 problem on a 2002 Accord,Bought a scanner from Amazon. Used it to find out this might be my check engine light problem. It worked great. Recommend buying the O2 sensor removing tool. I went though hell removing it without it. Good luck
5,An actual book,Ajzen summarize the actual literature of attitudes and personality (measurement and applies) in a comprehensive book. I recommend!
5,Delicious Dining - With Dignity.,"If you care for, or just visit with an elder, you need this book. It answers a need with elegant and simple tips and recipes for meals served to the elderly or disabled. No condescension here, just a thread of respect for our veteran citizens, ingenious eating utensils, and flavorful (I've tried it.) food.The book is beautiful to look at, with easy to follow recipes and elegant color photographs."
1,Boring read for good subject,"Reading through this book is a BORE! :( Examples are almost non-existant, there's like nothing (like definitions) on the sides of the pages, and no glossary. How poorly written! Please find an alternative to learn this rather interesting subject. Thank you!-Upset reader of this school book"
1,Incomplete,"I wonder how the author can claim to be an expert when over 200 artists are left out of the book and a lot of great kaleidoscopes are also left out. A large number of the scopes are far better than those listed in this book on kaleidoscope artistry. It seems that this book is only about the members of the Brewster organization, owned and operated by the author. If this is the case, I recommend you save your money and do a little research elsewhere, like the internet. I found a lot of great scopes and artists there and at art fairs. I really wish I could have given this great marks, but it does seem to be a repeat of the authors other books on this subject. The pictures are great."
4,Great Book,"Just leafed thru but can hardly waite to really read, full of great pictures & history of kaleidoscopes. Amazing pictures"
5,I love it!,"I own all of Cozy's books. They just keep getting better and better. The kaleidoscopic images are beautifully presented as well as the exteriors of the kaleidoscopes shown. As an avid collector, what I especially liked, was reading the ""up close and personal"" comments of artists whose work I own and have met personally over the years. My only hope is that there will be many more books coming from Cozy."
3,Not What I Expected,"This book is not quite what I expected from Fern Michaels. It is unlike many of her other books, and quite frankly, I didn't care for it. The plot is about two boys, raised by the same woman, who become very different people, one becomes the Chief of the Seminole Nation, the other is a man of the world. One white, the other Native American, but both sworn brothers. I just didn't like the setting (historical) and the characters. I enjoy Fern Michaels writing, and her more modern settings. She is excellent, and can capture one's imagination, but not with this book."
3,Could not connect,"I just could not get into this book, I read at least 90 pages, and it just could not get interested in it."
1,Battle Hymns: Songs of the Civil War,"This is a set of Hollywood-type orchestral stylings of someof the very greatest civil war hymns, whose vital messages --their words -- are almost totally excluded. Marches are done inslow time, keys are altered illogically, dynamic markings, etc.,bear no relationship to the original, and two numbers are included which are not authentic music of the times. Orchestralplaying is occasionally sloppy. The digital recording (Canadian)of what is presented is very good.An unqualified disaster."
3,Not technical at all,"Absolutely not a technical book with a missleading title..because the simple fact that the word BIBLE imply everything is cover ,and this is not the case.I will call it ""Introduction to Windows Vista Ultimate""..Part 1 (with 6 chapters) is and stormy rush thru Windows Vista Ultimate and then you will be send to the others parts of the book for expandingexplanation..so that looks redundant to me..Another thing is the use of not realy windows words like Chapter 3 ""contextual toolbar"" to explain the change on the menu toolbar.I typed in help Contextual toolbar and shows nothing..But first time users that not like the tutorial included with the progam is perhaps ok, but a waste of money ,in my opinion buying this book.Thanks"
5,add it to the stack,"I've got so many of these types of books, cuz as far as I'm concerned, each book has a little some thing that all the other don't have. It could be nothing,or it could pertain to an insignificate thing that may be a fix. Thats why I have a stack I've bought used thus saving a fortune, yet out fitting my library! JS"
5,Windows Vista Ultimate,"well, this book arrived in good conditions ,clean ,and nice ready to use it, ,buy it"
1,Over-priced and Out Dated!,"This witch-hunt is over. The creator of MSBP (Roy Meadow) has been exposed and discredited for his ""fanciful tales"" and courts all over the UK are overturning convictions. Courts in the US are recognizing that this is not a diagnosis accepted by any medical establishment.Child abuse can not be diagnosied by warning signs and attention-seeking behavior can only be diagnosed by a qualified professional once a crime has been established by medical fact."
1,"Good pics, bad math","I may be the only one who liked the illustrations, and the instructions are simple and straightforward (albeit incomplete). But I agree with krhino41 about the cut-charts: the authors apparently made no significant effort to proof their work. Although the vanities I made from this book worked out tolerably well, in the base cab plans I have found five critical design errors so far. As a result I now have a nearly finished base cab carcase in the shop that will be tinder for a bonfire come colder weather, and I'll be taking pages from this book to light it."
3,For Those Interested in Building,"This book was not what I expected. However it gives good details on how to do the construction of several items on your own. If you are just looking for ideas as I was and are not interested in doing yourself, this is not the book for you."
1,It's not a story about a Lost Eden. It is about a Restoration Plan,"I thought it was really something about Africa's Lost Eden, like they were able to capture on film the last ""Eden"" Animals in Africa, without humans. I don't want to see humans in ""Africa"" or ""Eden""-themed films. I waited for about an hour for the real story to begin but as soon as the bull elephant died, the story was over even before I knew it. What a total waste of money! And there's only one story in it. Oh wait, I couldn't have waited for an hour because it was just 50 minutes. The only redeeming part of this film is that you get to help National Geographic when you buy their films. When I think about that, I do not really regret buying it."
2,"Please, Carole, DO something with your talent","Carole Maso has an amazing gift for language. In some of the stories, like ""Sappho Sings the World Ecstatic,"" she makes poetry, using rhythm and rhyme and unique combinations of words. So why is she trying to write prose? She has no talent for plot or dramaturgia; her ""stories"" go nowhere. They are most likely autobiographical, and real life does not make good fiction. Most authors who write from their own experience actually exert effort trying to turn life into art--but not Maso. Obviously, she is a talented writer. It strikes me as pure laziness--backed up by the postmodern notion of ""challenging traditional structures""--that she makes no effort to use her talent to create anything resembling a narrative. I have read three books by Maso and I will continue to read her work because of its poetry. I look forward to a day when I can read a book written by her that does not leave me feeling irritated by her artistic arrogance and general self-involvement."
2,I did not like it.,"I bought this book at the recommendation of Amazon.com, but was very disappointed. It is more a collection of seemingly unrelated, unfinished sentences rather than a book with a story and a plot. I read the first third, but ended up skimming the remainder. I guess, it all comes together in the end, but I'm not really sure. I was expecting a good story about women, instead I got something very difficult to follow"
3,Your Political Interviewees should ask you about Christine Quinn,"taking money from the Mafia....or George Stephapolus who I guess also lives in New York...we have the most worst mayor in human history ( if what that eden girl said in weeds is true about bush being worst US president in History and Bloomberg is basically a smart sensitve jewsish ""dubya"" who also gased his own people.(well alot of Goyim mostly))and these people are nit picking some senator from wyoming...what hypocrites 2 legged Harvard GarbageOh and enjoy my money you took with your Bush Tax cuts..dont remmeber you giving it back...for 10 years...I guess there now Obama Tax cutsoh and I hope you enjoyed my money in the eighties you and your Friedmanian friends who took in O'Reagan/ O' Neil Tax cuts...I hope you enjoyed it I could have not been homeless not been crazy not been single I hope you enjoyed my money...Chistine/Christiane NY Lady Devils"
2,Disapointing,"I bought this tea kettle a couple of years ago. Initially, I was delighted with its sturdiness, and attractive design. Unlike other tea kettles I'd seen, the manufacturer did not specify that one needed to use a low or medium heat with it, enabling water to heat more quickly. Since we drink tea and coffee frequently, I looked forward to many years of use. Unfortunately, it has now developed a leak at the base of the spout, where it attaches to the body of the tea kettle. I need to replace it, since it leaks constantly, flooding my drip pans and stove top."
1,Photographing Children in Black & White,I did not like this book at all. I'm a beginner and I'm trying to learn everything I can. I felt as though I didn't learn anything from this book. I wasn't too impressed with the photos. I would not recommend this book. I had a professional photographer review the book and she agreed with me.
2,A pretty girl does not a musician make,"Tough-girl rap set against old rock samples was a fairly daring idea, but the combination of a fairly untalented rapper along with samples that are familiar enough to make you think of those songs rather than Misa herself makes this one a pretty unrewarding experience."
2,Tedious,"This novel, why mimicking finer cyberpunk fair, becomes overburdened with far-fetched unlikeable characters with an overly heightened political sensibility... Also, the story is muddled and overly contrived, an interesting idea poorly executed. In the end, the novel becomes tedious drudgery with little relief.I sincerely hope the author's finer works are more refined and mature, but I think I'm throwing in the towel on Mr. McCleod."
5,Buddha loves it,"My dog, a 75-pound Golden Retriever mix named Buddha, loves ALPO Come'N Get It. When he was a pup, we had him on Purina Puppy Chow and when he turned two, we took him to visit a family member and noticed he kept trying to eat the other dog's ALPO. Needless to say, the other dog wasn't too happy.When Buddha was old enough to have dog food, we knew what to buy. When we walked in with the bag, it's like he knew exactly what it was. He jumped for joy, did a quick little spin and was ready to eat. I swear, if he were human, he'd have a handkerchief around his neck, fork and knife in hand.He loves ALPO Come'N Get It. Not only does it smell delicious (unlike other dog foods that smell like Play-Doh), it's inexpensive, so it doesn't hurt our wallet. He certainly doesn't seem tired of the flavor as he certainly acts as though he looks forward to being fed. As soon as he hears the bag, he comes running."
1,"A Coffee Table book, nothing more.","This book is lousy. Written by a non-technical marketing type, it contains a lot of pretty-pretty pictures and minimal micky-mouse text. Its not helped by the deadening effect of a leaden translation - the original was written in German.There are vast errors of ommision, there's not a single critical phrase, and its not comprehensive; for example the 2.4 fuel injected 'T's of 1973 aren't even mentioned.A total waste of money - if you actually want to know something about 911 engines, buy Paul Fere's excellent '911 Story.'"
5,Very nice knives for the money,"I have these for over 3 years now, and they are very very nice. Good steel, nice handles, good construction, and keeps the edge very well.These are not as nice as some other ""top end"" knife sets, but for the money, they can be beat.I highly recommend."
5,"A wonderful, multicultural anthology for young readers.","Patricia Hruby Powell's Blossom Tales is a wonderful picturebook anthology filled with short one-page or two-page folk stories from around the world; each story involving a flower in one way or another. The superbly presented color illustrations by Sarah Dillard add life and vigor to these classic folklore and fairytale stories. Blossom Tales is a wonderful multicultural anthology for young readers, filled with variety, color, and life."
2,No confidence !!!,"I just took the practice exam for 640-821 (chapter 11) after having read the 10 chapters and extensively reviewed ""Part 1"" of the book, chapters 2 -7 for the first half exam of the CCNA. I found very little correlation between the chapters and the practice exam questions. It seems that many of the questions for the 640-821 practice exam are taken from material covered in chapter 10 which is supposed to be for exam 640-811. I have no confidence in the book and its division of the required material for each exam!"
5,"KILLING PEACE is a quick, concise must-read","To my mind, the expanding civil war in Colombia is the biggest story in the Western Hemisphere -- but no one seems to be paying much attention to it. Good thing, then, that we have Garry Leech, a talented reporter and writer whose book explains it all, from the start of the trouble over fifty years ago to the U.S.'s involvement today with more and more money, guns, and soldiers. If George Bush gets his way, Colombia is going to be the next bloody battle in the ""war on terrorism."" Americans need to get wise to what's going on before we sink any deeper into Colombia and a world of hurt and regret. Step one: Read this book!"
5,fast delivery,Book was delivered quickly and in the condition as listed. I was pleased with the low price and easy process. I would order from this vendor again.
4,Indy 500,It is like any other racing games on the atari like pole position and grand prix. I lost the driving controler so i cant play it anymore and i have not played it for years. It is one of the first game to come out on the atari too. I remember that it was really fun.
5,Specs,"Specifications:Color & Exterior Material: Black Neoprene.Exterior dimensions: 12.75"" x 14.5"" x 1.5"" (all dimensions are HxWxD)Device compatibility: 12.5"" x 14.25"" x 1.25""Weight: 1 lbsLifetime Warranty"
4,Great knife for the money,"I chose these knives because (1) they are forged, and (2) they appeared to be the right balance between quality and price. I suspect if I was a professional chef I would know the difference and buy the super expensive other brands, but for a recreational cook I find these knives to be supurb. The price is right, the balance and heft is great, and they hold a fine edge. I usually run them through a hand sharpener before I use them, and they are always razor sharp. To restore edges (I haven't had to do that yet with these knives) I use the ""scary sharp"" sandpaper on glass method."
1,It Won't Hold An Edge,"I bought this as a replacement for a damaged Wusthoff slicer. It was a total waste of money. Even slicing poultry, it simply will not stay sharp. Other knives get honed on a monthly basis, but this one needs to be honed three times in a single turkey slicing job! It is ""outa here""!!"
1,Don't buy it,"I bought this CD for evaluation purposes. It is full of mistyping, mathematical errors. The whole CD is against what it should be: teaching and practicing mathematics"
1,MXZ Doesn't Cut It!,"I wish I read these product reviews before I made the purchase. It absolutely will not cut anything as advertised. These people should be banned from selling anything! The seller has to know that he/she is stealing from the public.Another example of ""buyer beware"" - do not buy anything from these TV ads until you have read reviews."
1,The MXZ saw is a piece of junk,"When I watched a demontration of this saw cutting through all different types of material like metal, glass and brick I was amazed and at such a great price. When I received it and tried to cut a small to medium sized branch I did not have the same success. It is like a butter knife more than a saw. After half an hour trying to cut this branch, I finally gave up. I must admit, I wish I had the saw they were showing on the TV advertisement. The one I have is definitely not it. This is a piece of junk. I only wish I could get my money back. Best I can tell, it won't cut through anything."
1,MXZ Saw- wrong tool for any job,"The MXZ saw is not unique or revolutionary. It uses the same carbide used on masonry saws. They are great for cutting hard things like stone or ceramic, but terrible for soft things like wood or metal. There are saws made for cutting these materials and they do a much better job than this piece of junk could ever do. There is no way to get a clean straight edge. If your intent is to do sloppy work as inefficiently as possible, by all means, buy one.So how does it do as a masonry saw? Terrible. The blade is much too short to use comfortably. It As a tile saw it also fails. It can't cut a curve. For less than the cost of this worthless item, you can get a wire blade to mount in your hacksaw handle. Being round, it can be used like a jigsaw to cut any shape in a tile.Oh, there is one task where it excels. Thieves use them to cut hardened lock hasps. Fits nicely in a pocket to. I guess every tool has a purpose. Nice."
3,Upper body strength needed,This saw does cut thru tile. However it takes a lot of strenth and stamina. We used it for ceramic 4 inch wall tile. Each tile took 2-3 hours of sawing.
2,after using it,"using it on emt tubing ( thin wall, galvanized steel tubing ) it lost its cutting ability (no more abrasive edge ) after only four or five cut ( they were 3/4"" in diameter ).nevertheless, the idea sounds good, something to carry in the trunk for an emergency"
3,Not sure what to think!,"I have only tried to cut on small piece of wood with this thing - It didn't do a great job, but it might do better on metal, masonry, ceramaics etc. Just haven't had the need to cut those kind of things yet"
1,Don't bother,"So, this saw is supposed to be able to cut through metal, wood, pipe, etc.. Well, in my experience, it couldn't cut through anything. First, I tried thin gauge metal, and after 100 or so strokes, I'd only progressed 3/4 inch and developed big-time Popeye arm. Same experience with a piece of wood. How can a saw not even cut a piece of wood? Build quality was also poor; in the fully extended/locked position, the blade was a bit wobbly. What a piece of junk."
1,Stupidest thing ever lol,This is such a waste of money.. Nothing to do with the seller just the product itself sucks.. My husband collects knives so I thought it would be cool to get it but it doesn't even cook through anything..
2,Superficial and repetitive,"A complex topic (fatness and size acceptance) is presented with a one-sided perspective, and worse, the book is boring. While some of these ""facts"" might be new to a few readers, mostly this is a rehashing of old data combined with her qualitative research and personal experiences. Every chapter ends with tips, and they all sound very similar. The chapter on the spiral of acceptance sounds very similar to the Stages of Change presented in the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change, but her suggestions for how to go through the processes are, again, very simplistic.The idea that some weight loss for health can be appropriate is an anathema in this book.Maybe an o.k. introduction, but if you are the least bit familiar with size acceptance, read elsewhere. (The best part of the book is it's cover.)"
5,Love It!,"If you have PMS, mood swings any other hormonal explosion monthly or daily, I highly recommend this product. I used to take Xanax, I do not need it any longer, I just needed some help with hormonal balance. I would much rather take something natural than what I was taking."
5,"AD/HD ""Reference"" type book",Written by an author with AD/HD and who has a child with AD/HD - definitely a good read for understanding and dealing with the problem.
5,Great book for those with girls and ADHD,"I have a daughter with ADHD and came across this book on Amazon. After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try, boy am I glad I did. This book is fantastic! Filled with alot of information that I have found to be very helpful and useful for myself when it comes with dealing with my daughter and her being ADHD. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with a daughter who has ADHD."
5,Understand girls with ADHD,"Great info about the uniqueness of girls with ADHD. Finally found a resource that speaks to me, and helps me to better understand what my daughter's stuggles are like."
3,Good academic publication,"I think this book is a good overview of the issues about girls with AD/HD. If you are trying to determine whether your daughter has it, this book might be helpful. However, it is fairly research oriented and not very hands-on. I know my daughter already has it, and I am interested in how to mange the various issues. It doesn't really focus on day-to-day mangement or practical advice."
3,"Good information, liberal viewpoint","This book does contain some good information about ADHD characteristics, some of which apply to boys as well as girls. However, potential readers need to understand the very liberal viewpoint the author writes with. There is a great deal of cricticism of the past underdiagnosis of girls as gender discrimination. I don't see the benefit of this. The book's focus is less on practical helps and more on feelings and self-esteem."
5,Deliberate deception!!!!!,"This is very disapointing! Your DVD is sold under the name of "" Live in Chicargo"" - It is just the ""a Long Days Night"" DVD renamed to suck in the consumer to purchase more. Very decietful!Deliberate deception!!!!!""a Long Days Night"" is a fantastic Live BOC DVD, but I don't need to buy it again deciefully renamed."
3,Elijah - The novel,"The historical details and the background are great but the storyline felt too much like an action novel. To be fair, I was expecting a historical review and not a novel-style format, so it is likely my fault for not having read and understood the synopsis in the first place."
1,Publisher's Nightmare,"Not only does the author use hefty clumps of movie and music quotes to make him seem to have a smattering of intelligence, it's mangled to fit the public's view of ""good"". Ironically, this book is not.Keeping in the theme of movie quotes: Mr. Plieskatt, ""you are awarded no points and may god have mercy on your soul."" Better luck next time."
1,A perfect example of buying your way into the writing world,I cant believe that this author could even pay to have this book published. What a horrible waste of trees and my time!
5,Hot Watch!,"I bought this for my husband, he wanted a yellow face watch. It look nice online but even better in person."
2,Might as well finish the book - I opened and paid for it!,"I tried to give this book a chance. A lot of stories start off slow, right? Well, this story seemed to keep the same scheme throughout. It seems as if Mitchell's only quest in life was to make love to this man! I guess the book didn't hold any water to me because the entire story-line seemed to revolve around sex, and everything else was secondary. Yeah, sure they discussed love and relationships, but every 5 or 6 pages, someone was looking at someone else's booty! Is that the message the author is putting out about gay love? I'm not sure, but even in books based on heterosexual characters, sex isn't one of the main issues in the book! Another thing, it seems like ""The Second Time Around"" can't stand alone. It picks up exactly where ""B-Boy Blues"" leaves off! I know one is the sequal to the other, but to have to read the same story over again, but from a different point of view is asking a lot from the reader!"
5,This is an excellent choice,"Recently, I picked up this knife on sale at a local store and was very pleased with the quality and value it affords. I have long been a fan of Calphalon cookware and my impression now is that this same quality extends to their cutlery line as well. The blade was pretty sharp right out of the package, and with just a bit of work it was very sharp. The size and heft of this knife are very comfortable in my hand, and I find myself selecting this one from the knife drawer whenever I have a kitchen task where a full sized chef's knife would be overkill. I highly recommend this purchase!"
5,Excellent knife,"My grandparents always had quality knives when I was growing up. As I stocked my own kitchen, I searched for the best quality I could afford. I've tried Henkels and Chicago and both were disappointing. I bought this knife and was so impressed that I bought another and also bought one for my mother. It is superb in quality and comfort. I prefer the traditional handle over the contemporary handle. I put this knife in the diswasher and have had no problem with the handle. Great buy."
3,NASA item made in CHINA,"Disappointed that product was made in CHINA. Also, the white paint finish on the top of the space shuttle at insertion point through metal was chipped. Quality not what i expected. The night lite aspect is awesome,but had i known the quality, i would not have purchased."
2,"New condition, but no CD!!","Although the ISBN was the same as the one listed for my class, I was disappointed this book DID NOT include the CD. The condition of the book was new."
3,online account access had to be purchased separately,"book was in new condition, but I didn't know that I would have to pay extra for the online account...$40 more."
