2,Written by a mathematician for mathematicians,"The intended audience of this book are mathematicians. To understand this book, you should have prior coursework experience in at least several upper division undergraduate courses in mathematical statistics and probability theory. The structure of this book is also that of a typical math book; full of proposition, corollary, lemma, etc, and very limited use of illustrations (e.g., there is no single figure up to chapter 6).I wanted a book with a mathematical sophistication simliar to Durbin's book, but this book is way more than that. On the other hand, I showed this book to a mathematics graduate student and she said this book is perfect for her. So I guess this book is written by a mathematician only for mathematicians."
4,THE BEST OF ALL - TIME!,"Although games have been improved graphically with the influx of next - generation systems, no football game can match this first version on the SNES. Along with the two NES versions, these games offer unmatched fun and playability. Many of today's games use graphics as ' eye candy ' in order to hide a lack of gameplay for wouldbe players. THE ALL - TIME BEST!"
5,Love love,I love this perfume have been using it since Senior year in Jr High. I always get compliments on it. Some perfumes have a weird after-smell but this one is sweet and yeah it smells Delicious lol
5,Across America on an Emigrant Train.,This was a wonderful over view of the hardships endured by our ancestors as they made their way west. There is not really to much information out there about the emigrant trains and this one helped reinforce my own research of my own Grandfather's trip to the west coast with his family from West Virginia as a boy.Highly recomend for anyone interested in Pioneer times and life.
5,"Great pump, Great price!","This is my first shock pump. I've used it a few times so far and the pump works great. No problems, good price, came quick in the mail."
5,Pump...Pump...Pump it up,"The shock pump is amazing, light weight and recitative small in size. I have had no issues with the pressure reading being inaccurate. Even when a fellow biker ran it over (I guess to test the durability lol) with his 35 pound bike and weighing over 200 pounds. I have own this pump for 9 months and there's been no issues with the connector valve connection to the shock. It does what it supposed to do! The bleeder valve will let air out at a rapid rate if you hold it down. I rather have a pump bleed air like this then one taking its time. Im very picky have the right amount of air pressure before I go out riding. I would recommend the pump to anyone who has front shocks and or full suspension bike."
3,does not have anti bleed as advertised,"It works fine but I bought this fork pump for one reason and one reason only - because they claimed that when you released the pump from the inlet, it would not allow any air to escape. Not true - it does, just like everyone else's does, which means you have to figure out how much PSI it lets out, on average, and overpump your shock that much so that when you release it, it falls down to the PSI level you actually wanted.I was really disappointed, especially when one ""reviewer"" specifically lauded over how this pump has a ""super special valve that doesn't let any air out at all). yeah, right - thanks for the line of BS.At least it's made in Taiwan and not China (every decent bike or bike part not made in the USA is made in Taiwan), and it does work, albeit no better perhaps than anyone elses."
2,Personality Plus,Did care for the book. Don't know why as usually books with tests and strategies about a person pull me in. The reading was easy to follow. Just a bit much to swallow in my opinion. Kc
3,Basic...,"Very basic description of the personality types. Besides for holding seminars, etc I don't believe the author has any professional degrees in psychology or related fields so it made me cautious to believe some of the things she was saying (my friend Julie is x personality and did this, so everyone of that personality must be prone to doing this). Also it seems to have been written for a 10 year old and that probably added to my skepticism...The bible quotes everywhere were a little much for me but she's entitled to put her beliefs in her writings."
5,Personality Plus,"I recommend this book to anyone who deals with people. In other words, everyone should read this book. I have learned so much about myself and others. This book has taught me about why people act and think the way they do. I'm only 16 and I found this book to be incredibly helpful. I think your really missing something special if you don't read it."
5,Incredible resource,"The book is an outstanding resource for learning basic temperaments of people, understanding differences and developing skills to enhance relationships in all walks of life. The learning here can be applied to almost any aspect of personal and professional development. A ""must"" for any library!!"
1,Worst personality book I've read yet...,"When she states in her book about her husband telling her to get to the point, she should have listened. I didn't want to read about her personal life or the on going ramblings. I wanted to read a book to define my personality and enlighten me. I took the test and read the results and none of it matched me at all... It did not tell me who I was it wasn't right at all. Worst personality book I've ever read."
4,An interesting read,"I found this book to be a very interesting look into the personalities and temperaments of people. I can't say that it really taught me anything that I didn't already know about myself, but it certainly gave me insight that helped me to understand others a little better. The only thing I didn't care for in this book is the use of religious quotes and references to God sporadically (not to be confused with the author's use of proverbs). I don't have a problem with religion and hope my next statement doesn't offend people, but I would prefer not to have religion quoted to me when reading a book. If I wanted that I would be reading the Bible, not Personality Plus. I would have understood the ideas and concepts of the book perfectly well without the religious quotes."
5,personality plus,Great book It helps to better understand yourself and others. In doing so you appreciate how unique we really are.
5,This book has improved my relationships with people,"I read this book, did the personality test and have never laughed so much in all my life. All these years I have often wondered what it was about me that put people off me! and why some people annoyed me and others(not many) I got on with like a house on fire. I am fascinated that people can be catergorised in such a way and it is all so true."
2,Great Info--no help at all...,"I found that this book was great for identifying personality types, but useless after that point. Ms. Littauer several times in the book gives comprehensive advice like ""Accentuate the Positives. Eliminate the Negatives"" and ""Not Everything in Life can be Perfect, so relax."" I mean, we're not children here, such basic ""advice"" is just useless. How does one ""accentuate the positive?"" Obviously Ms. Littauer has no idea. Her Biblical references are irritating and add nothing to the book but italics. Find a different personality typing book if you want something useful to read."
3,Personality Plus,Delivery was fast. Book was in good shape. Not crazy about the writing in the book and the self tests being filled out already.
2,Level 1 Reading,"I have used their personality test sheet which I really liked so I bought the book to deepen my understanding. This book speaks to the reader at an elementary level, like talking to a child. I found it a bit upsetting and discontinued the book after chapter 1. If you're totally new to personality theories and or psychology as a whole, this book may be for you - if you have aquired a knowledge foundation in psychology this book feels almost like an insult. It made me feel like the authors think that the readers are like little dumb children that need stupid 'real life' examples after every single point... This book should in fact be in the children section or maybe young adults."
5,Personality Plus,I read this book quite a few years ago but I really enjoyed the updated version. She has so much wisdom about this topic. I teach school and I have my students take this test. It really helps me to understand them and plan accordingly. It has also helped me to understand my kids and husband. I highly recommend it to parents and educators. Very enlightening!
3,not as ordered,"Prompt delivery of item, but not as described. I ordered new, received used good condition. Was offered full refund for return, but accepted partial refund since I sent as gift to a family member not home for Christmas. My step-brother loves it."
5,A book for everyone purchased at Amazon,I recommend this book to everyone. One can benefit by first understanding your basic personality (strengths and weaknesses) and thereby understanding others. If you don't like self-help books I promise you will love this one.
4,Gourmet Smoothies for Special Occasions,"This book is yet another beautifully photographed book of drinks that can loosely be defined as smoothies.None of these drinks are difficult to make, and the several I've done have been delicious.However, the buyer should be aware that a great proportion (perhaps the majority) use either liquor, such as rum, or liqueurs. I'd be inclined to classify this book as a bar reference rather than a food book. Again, the ones I've made have tasted great as mixed drinks. Just don't plan to use these recipes as meal replacers!Most of the ingredients are available in urban areas. The expense per drink is more comparable, again, to mixed alcoholic drinks than the meal replacer type of smoothie.This can be an excellent reference for someone wanting to go beyond daquiris and pina coladas into more exotic bar drinks. Buy as a bar reference, not for your children!"
5,Just What I've Been Searching For!,"For several weeks I searched for the perfect blender drink book for my fiancee and his new blender. He is not really the home appliance type, but figured a blender would be the perfect machine for summer gatherings. I was hoping to suprise him on his birthday, but much to my dismay, I was having no luck finding just the right book with simple yet tasty recipies. Then I came across ""Smoothies and Other Blended Drinks"" (Ryland, Peters and Small Little Gift Books). This book is absolutely terrific for those of us that want to the point recipies for all ages. Not only does it give you recipies but also little tips on how to use your blender. I recommend this book for anyone who owns a blender, as it will make creating tasty treats an efficient, fun task!"
1,SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS,"I WAS GIVEN A COPY OF THIS SHOW ,AND WAS HURT TO SEE THE SHOW PUT IN A BACK YARD SETTING,WHICH IS HOW SOME FESTIVALS ARE DONE. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF PLAYING WITH THESE CATS A FEW TIMES,ON PERCUSSIONS,AND VOCALS. I HAVE TO SAY THIS DVD DOES THEM NO GOOD! I WOULD ALMOST BELIEVE THEY DO NOT KNOW THIS PRODUCT OF THEM IS OUT. I REALLY BELIEVE THIS.IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE THEM IN PERSON,DO SO.THERE ARE DIFFERENT MUSICIANS ,WHICH IF YOU PLAY,KNOW COULD MAKE ,OR BREAK YOU,IN THIS CASE IT BROKE!SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS!"
2,Sad and Hurt,"When I purchased this dvd I was really excited about the chance of finally seeing George and Louis live.But as soon as the music started I knew what I was in for.Being a musician you know when a set is just not happening. Out of tune saxophone, and just weak musicians altogether.George and Louis`s musicianship has definitely deteriorated.I learned to play bass because of hearing Louis.Now I hate to say it but, I can play like Louis better than Louis.Damn,what a shame."
2,The Brothers deserve a better DVD,"I was thrilled when I knew about this DVD, since I just love The Brothers Johnson music. A live performance with some of their classics, in Dolby 5.1 audio? A must have I thought... What a disappointment. George and Lous still are great performers and the renditions of the songs are ok, but the video quality (a non-anamorphic, letterboxed image that lacks sharpness) sucks. And where is the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio advertised in the package? I could only find a 2.0 analog track that comes mostly from the center channel and sounds mono for me. As bonus material there's a behind-the-scenes documentary that just made me wonder about what two of the finest black players/musicians from the 70's were doing there. Just embarassing. So, if you really like the guys and their music, listen again and again their albuns and forget this DVD."
2,Uhm...Ain't we funkin Now? uhm...no,"I was hoping this was a rare concert of the Brothers Johnson in their hay day. This is a concert of middle aged men who physically let themselves go. The energy, synergy is just not there. This is a pass, the picture on the cover is totally misleading..."
4,Daydreaming,"I was born and raised on Maui, and now live in Las Vegas. This body wash really brings the scent of Hawaii into your home. I started daydreaming of the beachs on Maui. It was a nice get away, even for just a moment to relax and take some stress away from a long day. If you like you lather thick, this body wash will not be for you. There is some bubbles, but not thick."
3,It's a buy!,"The album is good but not Humphries best, would reccommend buy though. Strong cuts are 1, 2, 6,7,9,and 13. Best is 13.. I love Roy Davis Jr. and this cut has got to be in tha top five..its a cut feat. Shirley Ceasar and its definitley Tony's style. 1 and 7 rank second."
4,"great beats, but the vocal arrangements are not good enough","the beats are really gorgeous and just for them you have to get this cd. Still most of the vocal arrangements are just not good, even sound off on many of the tracks. Philadelphia is overrated, my personal choice includes pick it up, 15, 1,2, only you. Kerri Chandler is still the most amazing dj in deep house/garage I have ever heard - run to get his compilation under the same label - it is inspired, stylish, conceptual, addictive, full of love for this art, simply flawless. Can somebody tell me of other divine artists in garage like Kerri? I want more and more of this drug."
4,"Great book for Boston, but could be better for outside areas","As are almost all lonely planet books, this is a great, GREAT book for covering the metro Boston area. I recommend it as THE book to use, especially if traveling to Boston. It goes into depth on all aspects of Boston culture, down to climate, money scams, and gay and lesbian tourists. Although the book doesn't explain every site on the walking tours, it does give an overall, helpful picture of the tours in general. It also tells about the hot clubs and places to go, with regular updates and good descriptions.However, if you're looking for excursions outsiode of Boston, or are, like me, a new resident of Boston, you may not want to get this book, becauise it focuses on the Boston area. In that case, get Lonely Planet:New England, or a new resident's book. And for a shorter, cheaper version of this book, get Lonely Planet Boston:Condensed.Hope it helps."
4,Great place to start,"This is a great place to start if you don't know anything about Boston. It gives lots of interesting places and attractions to visit. Even thought most of the places mentioned by LP is concise and accurate, be warned that some of the ""attractions"" mentioned are over rated."
5,Sylvie and Bruno Is Totally Worth The Read,"There is *nothing* disappointing about Sylvie and Bruno. It is not anything like Alice.. it surpasses Alice in every way.This book is filled with a goodness that just can't help itself... and while it can be silly at times, and crazy at others, in the end it brings me to tears, every time. It is noble and honest and the characters steal your heart...Not all of life is suffering... and this book is about that. I would really encourage you to pick it up. The first few chapters are a little crazy as you get used to this half-reality half-fantasy style... but it pulls you in so quickly, and will really blow you away.An absolutely wonderful book!"
5,Superior Asset Portfolio - never runn out of money,"Similar to ""Buckets of Money"" this books shows that ""Asset Allocation"" will not assure your life savings to the end of your life. This approach basically is the Two Bucket version of ""Buckets of Money"" In fact the author of that book, endorses this Asset Dedication book in so far that it validates his approach. Also has links to web site that helps you develop your portfolio."
2,Warning for practicing Catholics!!,"If you are a practicing Catholic, and are thinking of buying this book, you should know it promotes birth control, many forms of which cause aboritions. I am returning the book for this reason."
1,I wouldn't if I were you...,"Gosh, so this has survived to go into further editions, has it?I hope they've dropped the authors' pro-male dominance & female submissiveness rants (this translates as ""every time he wants sex, you let him have it, and don't worry your pretty little head about it because it's what the baby Jesus wants you to do"") which were actively disowned by the UK publishers.But I bet they haven't."
1,oh please,"if you are engaged or married and clueless about how to properly have sex then you either1) should not be engaged or married2) should probably examine the formative events of your adolescence and determine where exactly you went wrongi am not even sure i have much to say about this topic. i am completely baffled that there needs to be a book about this. sex is supposed to be a natural thing. having to read an awkwardly written how-to guide beforehand just makes you seem sad. i am very sorry for anyone who feels that they need this book. also, i have been having sex since i was 16 years old (i am 25 now) and guess what? i love it! and i'm good at it! practice, practice, practice. don't waste your time and money on this piece of crap book when you should be learning through doing."
4,Detailed and helpful but somtimes cold.,"I purchased this book before my honeymoon in hopes of ithelping my wife and I get the maximun enjoyment out of sex in ourmarrige. The first few chapters are rather dry and cold speaking mostly of anatomy and the like. After that there are some excellent tips to making sex very enjoyable and not discouraging, especially if its your first time. These chapters helped me tremendously in finding out what God intended for sex and pleasing my wife. All the tips he gives in these chapters are very long and tedious. If you think you have these problems prepare yourself for some fun but hard work. Lots of practice sessions with total vulnerability with your partner. And probably with some disappointments. It can be tedious reading but stick with it, it is helpful. Some of the commentary is very clinical and dry, but helpful when you apply it. I really saw the heart of the writers, which is to help and instruct people to have the most fulfilling sex life as possible. END"
4,good overview of sex relationship with Christian foundation,Book was great - slightly repetative but really gives you a good spiritual and medical explanaition of sex an marriage with the tools to improve both your sex and emotional relatioship with your spouse.
3,Very good advice,Book is good for couples of all ages. Very detailed oriented. I would recommend this book to anybody looking to enrich their marriage.
4,If id known,If id known this book was foe newly wed couples I don't know that I would have gotten it.. its a really good book just not for me bc I know majority of it iv been married for 6 yrs.
4,Intended for pleasure,"I enjoyed reading this book. I found it informative and helpful. I did not read the last few chapters as they were about the love life of you and your spouse in your 60's, 70's etc...I'll wait a few years until I read those chapters. ;) Overall I would recommend this book to friends. I like how it is not just about the physical aspect of sex, it focuses on the most important part...the relationship between you and your spouse. That single handedly affects your love life more than any other thing."
1,Intercourse-least likely way intended for pleasure,"The updates are admirable. When are the Christian Marriage/Sex experts going to stop making the main focus of sex about intercourse? Christian wives wait for the first time to make love and almost all are disappointed. The facts are that while women enjoy the closeness and bond of intercourse with their husbands, they do not have orgasms that way! The Wheats, as well as other authors, must address this to save marriages. Orgasm is a God-given pleasure to men and women."
2,beware of extreme bias- this book is not for everyone,"I know this is a ""Christian"" book but what it has to say about masturbation and homosexuality is inconsistent with healthy human natural desire. If you want a book that conforms to a very narrow view then this one is perfect. If you are looking for equality between the sexes or up to date information about human sexuality then you won't find it in this book. Also the authors stole a lot from Masters and Johnson and do not give them credit. I thought stealing was a sin."
2,Not so hot.,"I was given this book by my therapist to read. I found that a few points were interesting and informative, but overall, the book was a snooze. It seems to be made for the older crowd, not so much the young twenty-something-to-be-newlywed. Chapter 10 is ESPECIALLY a crock, titled, ""The 'Perfect' Wife."" That was what really turned me off to the book and made me think this was totally not worth my time. There are much better books on this subject out there."
3,A Little Technical,"We have not finished the book yet, but we intend to.We enjoyed the anatomy lesson in the first few chapters though. ;)Seriously, this book does a pretty good job of addressing the technical details of sex and pleasure. We learned some very valuable information prior to our wedding and honeymoon and it helped prepare us.But we have found the language to be very.. sterile (pardon the pun). It sounds like a medical doctor's textbook at times. Not that this has to be an exciting read, but it did feel a little dull.Still, I'm glad we had a resource like this immediately prior to marriage and we would recommend it."
1,"Too clinical, yet not enough information","This was the first book I read for help on marital intimacy. It was a wedding gift from a friend that meant well. I read all of it, and found only the most basic info of it helpful in any meaningful way. My husband read the first few chapters, and was so turned OFF by what it said that he stopped there, and I can't blame him. Clinical, humorless, and not at all relatable, not to mention all the issues, techniques, etc that was not even addressed by the authors. I gave my copy away.I've since read many, many other books, and can highly recommend ""Sheet Music"" (for both genders) by Kevin Leman, ""The Sexually Confident Wife"" by Shannon Ethridge for women, and ""Sex, Romance, and the Glory Of God"" for men by C.J. Mahaney."
5,Must for Newly Weds!!!!,If you are getting married BUY THIS BOOK!!!! It will save you from so many issues that can hurt your marriage. If possible have both of you read in in the month or so before the wedding. This book helped us have an Awesome honeymoon with realistic expectations for people who saved themselves for marriage. It also helped us talk through important things we would not have thought about prior to the wedding. So I consider this book essencial!!! Even if you are not newly weds the information in this book can help renew the sex life in your marriage. Basically...Get this book!!!
1,Useless,"This book was given to me after three years of happy, successful marriage. I suspect now that the motivation stemmed more from a lack of grandchildren than any concern over my sex life with my husband. I ended up tossing it in a box to moulder after the first couple of chapters, and it certainly hasn't hurt my marriage in the least to ignore the so-called advice in it.I found the text to be utterly useless, and offensive to my intelligence and sense of worth as a woman. The biology section, though dry, was at least relatively factual. I frankly stopped reading when I discovered that the sexual technique section was horribly lacking in information and sadly out of date. There are less than half a dozen possible positions listed, and most of those are just slight variations on plain old Missionary. I don't recommend anyone limit themselves to the stiltedness in these pages. There are MUCH better guides out there.Don't bother buying this one. It's a waste of money, not to mention time."
3,Gardner drifts on his reputation,"Full of interesting but trivial anecdotes, this work finds Gardner obviously in love with himself, and preaching to the converted among followers of his educational theories, which are based on a delineation of mental modes which is idiosyncratic and not in step with recent research. His Frames of Mind some years back was much more significant, and humbler."
4,Interesting,"Even though Gardner brings up many good points about multiple intelligences and how they affect everyone, there were some chapters that it seemed that he just keep repeating the same concept over and over again. I truly felt that Gardner made many good points and that he is quite ""intelligent."" I agreed and disagreed about some of the intelligences, but in the end, he was able to convince me that maybe there are some things that we don't understand, but still can make sense. Even though I had to read it for a class, it was quite good and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read up more about psychology or the MI theory that Gardner describes through out the book."
2,Did they forget to pay the fact-checker?,"The authors needed to do a better job of researching their chapter on Long Beach (where I was born, raised, and currently live). Much of what they wrote about the geography and socio-political environment was factually incorrect."
1,"alright game, but hasn't aged well","this was an ok game back in the day, but I cannot recommend it. 1 star."
2,Tecmo Review,"Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen are definitely on this game, but are are on the injured list so you can't play with them. So in essence, they might as well not be on the game. Overall, this game was ok. NBA Showdown, NBA Jam, and the NBA Live Series of games were much better."
5,Tecmo Super NBA Basketball is a must-have for basketball fans!!!!!,"This basketball game for the SNES is awesome. If you are a sports fan and you like the style of Tecmo Super Bowl then you must get this game. This game is just as fun to play as Tecmo Super Bowl. It has all the cool features of TSB and many new features, as well. This game includes all the NBA stars from the 90's: Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and more! Like TSB, this cool game is always fun to play alone or with friends."
4,My very pithy review,"Two words sum up why this game is a timeless classic: Michael Jordan. No other game had him, but this one did--and he was as unstoppable on here as we was in real life. What a game!"
3,a basketball classic,very good game you can play as the legends when they were still playing and you can find some players in there that were young then and now they are the veterans or recently retired just fun to play as them now.
3,Vernacular of time period it was written,This was written in the vernacular of the time it was written in. This is interesting and quaint to a point. After a while it gets somewhat boring - expecially when the book goes into much more than the life of Daniel Boone.
2,Somewhat engaging story approach; contains too many errors of fact; once over too lightly;,"Having read much regarding Boone and his family, I chose this book with the hopes of learning new facts and observations regarding this great pioneer/scout. The story book approach was not particularly appealing to me, but the errors of fact, particularly early on in the story, tainted my opinion nearly from the outset. I would not recommend this book to anyone interested in actual details, but I would recommend it as a story book to be read to or by younger children who might enjoy a summary account of Boone's adventures."
3,recommended,"For those interested in history, and particulary this era, the book was interesting and informative, however, it wasn't too well written."
4,first impressions,"As i write, i am merely five tracks into my first listen of this cd and already i am confident that it is well worthy of my presumptuous four star rating. As its title suggests, these infectuous, jazz-infused rhythms are most definitely 'in the house', inspiring in me both a sense of nostalgia for the afterhours haunts of days gone by and subsequently an urge to get up out of my chair. that said, if you have ever yourself emerged, bleary-eyed into the dawn from the cavernous depths where the party continues without you, you'll appreciate coming to know this disk."
3,Academic fun,"Alexander Theroux's essays on blue, red and yellow are amusing and fun to read, but there's little to tie the reams of random information he unleashes. Think of Primary Colors as a light successor to Robert Burton'sThe Anatomy of Melancholy (New York Review Books Classics)."
5,a good sendoff for the trilogy,"I found one narrative flaw in this book--the revelation thatthe Land is more likely to be real than merely the product ofCovenant's imagination as demonstrated by scenes of the Lords before Covenant's advent into the Land. Aside from this, the book continues faithfully the tale of the Unbeliever in the Land. The ending, despite superficial cliches, was very good. In fact, given the evidence in the rest of the series, there was no other way to end the story. However, I consider the strong qualities of the book to outweigh the narrtive weaknesses to such an extent I will grant it five stars."
5,A classic to read over and over,"This series always takes pride of place on my bookshelf. Donaldson has created a complex and rich land and populated it with compelling characters and creatures. Covenant is the perfect antidote to the predictable fantasy hero, becoming resolute in his hatred for Foul and growing in character throughout the three books of the first chronicles. Comparable to Tad Williams, Feist and Terry Goodkind, but for me still edges it as the best!"
2,Series is not worth the time. . .,"You can also read my review of the series in my review of the 1st book. Basically, I just want to restate how un-impressed and how boring this un-inspiring series was. Donaldson focuses so heavily on his writing style and his portrayal of a one-dimensional self-pitying Covenant that he forgot to write a story which would captivate his audience. Instead he writes a very rudimentary, unimaginative, predictable plot with flat unbelievable characters. My suggestion is not to waste your time reading this series as I did."
4,very dark,"Time in the Land has made Covenant out of place in any world. The fruits of his actions haunt him, and his search for peace drives him to the brink of death, a thing that would make too many people witout hearts rejoice. Yet, his heart has been cured of leprosy, even if his body is sicker than ever. So, when he has the chance to save a child, he takes the risk of condemning the Land to save her. Then, he is given the chance to rectify his error and is taken to the Land to find it changed. The Bloodguard and Giants are no more, the girl who loved him is old and insane. It's now or never for the Unbeliever to face Lord Foul, but with a heart so filled with lornness, how can he fight despair incarnate?This book is another winner, one that reminds us that hope always lives."
5,Excellent!!,"When I finished, I felt... well, the words of the Land fit it best! Melenkurion abatha!! Duroc minas mil khabaal!! I felt that the triumph of Mhoram, Covenant and the Land as if it were my own.I've never read a more intense book. Read it!!"
4,Ties the first two together,"I do not recommend this book if you haven't read the first two in the series. Once I read this one I understood better the emotional state of the main character, Thomas Covenant. It focus a lot on the inner struggle of the main character but there is constant reference to characters that were introduced earlier in the series. It is a good read but won't have a clear ending since the story is left open for the next in the series."
4,Thomas grows in belief.,"Or rather diminishes in disbelief. From start to finish, his disbelief has been a sore point with me. I've read the series four times so it couldn't have been too much. But thinking about it, I think I read it more for the other characters you get the chance to meet. Mhorim and his fellow priests. Saltheart Foamfollower who sadly must find his people have been exterminated. I could go on and on. Even the bad guys are very well executed.All in all, this series is worth the time to read, but I just can't give it a five star."
5,The Last Scraper/Brush Ill Need,Very solid scraper. I drive a toaster (element) so my car collects a lot of snow and having this scraper has made my winter months much easier. I can stand on one side of my car and clean off the entire thing without moving around it. Its convenient so I don't have to get snow in my shoes running on all sides of the car trying to clean it off. The pivoting head makes it nice to you can push snow off like a broom style or swipe it off like a normal brush. The aluminum seems to be very sturdy and wont give out on me if I really need to put some elbow grease into it. Unlike previous scrapers I've had which have been plastic and have gotten so cold sitting in the car that have broken in half trying to scrape the windshield clean. I'm very pleased with this purchase and don't see myself buying another scraper for years.
3,Bought Carrand Snow Broom Based on Reviews,"I bought a Snow Broom from Costco years ago and because of my stupidity I broke it by continually slamming my car door on it not realizing it was jammed. It took some real abuse, buy I finally broke the swivel end. Now I'm ready to buy another one and can't find them anywhere in stock. Checked the internet hoping to find the best snow broom. Ordered the Carrand 60"". Told my husband I bought him the ""Cadillac"" of snow brooms....LOL...Our Cadillac broke on our first snowstorm of 2009 in Northern VA...20 inches+. The snow broom and extension worked great. The ice scraper broke before we finished one car and the ice wasn't even that hard. So, now that Costco has them back in stock I will just pay $10 and hope for the best. I don't understand why it's so difficult to make a great snow broom/ice scraper. I'm willing to pay the big bucks, but not for crap. The best part is that I can clear off the SUV's with the telescoping pole."
3,It's old,"this is a great book but it was revised in 1988. That is hardly the modern way. Actually, most things don't change but I found a few things that are not true (like what kind of hay to feed). Any way, consider all your possibilities before investing in this book."
3,Not quite enough,"As beginners, we didn't feel this book gave us enough detailed information to care for the rabbits confidently."
1,Pet specific only,This may be okay for people interested in rabbits as pets but for meatkeepers it's worthless.
5,Must read series of books for any child,"Before magic and fantasy was the rage, there was Edith Nesbit. She has several series of books, one involving a family of children who ""by accident"" run across magical items which in turn begins adventures. The other series, this one in fact, is about a family of children who always try to do/be good, but their good intentions often go astray. Nesbit's works have been lost and found, lost and found over the generations. Thanks to J. K. Rowling, these books are in the found stage right now. Take the time and introduce your kids, and yourself, to a series of books you/they will treasure and want to pass down to future generations."
3,"Not really a series book, covers intelligence agencies","This book was thorough and well researched, but not of the UNCLE series. It covers intelligence (spy) agencies of the US, France, Russia and England with their various processes and set-ups. Potentially useful in the 60's when internet was not available and 24/7 News."
2,for 4-year-olds?,"I got this book for my 4-year-old little girl (supposedly, this books age range is 4-8-year-olds). She has just discovered mazes and loves them. This book is quite difficult, however. I wouldn't suggest it for children under maybe five or six."
4,"Same bed set as seen on ""Home Improvement"" show with Tim Allen","I bought this ensemble and later saw that it is the same set used in the bedroom of Tim and his TV wife on the sitcom ""Home Improvement."" There is nothing wrong with the quality of the items - we like them just fine."
2,Quality is not up to what I expected,The set is Great for the price but not good quality what I expected.
4,lordmi,"The set is Great for the price and is in good quality. The colors are good, rich and very coordinating, the sheets set is in very pretty design. The stripe bedskirt looks nice and ties all items together.I definitely Like it.I could not agree with previous review neither in color critics nor in quality of fabric."
3,Scratchy Material,"I received this last week. I love the colors, and it does brighten up the bedroom. But the material is horribly scratchy & I've washed it twice already, using extra fabric softener. I won't be able to use it until the scratchiness disappears (if it does) since my skin is sensitive to this. Hopefully it will be useable for me soon, or I'll have to donate the set to Goodwill."
3,Check compatibility before ordering,I didn't see any reference to a compatibility chart in the Amazon listing and should have checked the Hollywood Racks web site. Although it sounds from the description like it would work on most vehicles it does not fit a Honda Pilot. It's a real shame as I didn't want to have to add a hitch to the vehicle to get a bike rack but it looks like I have to. Otherwise it looked very sturdy - I'm sure it's great if it fits your vehicle. Check first at [...]
5,Hollywood Racks 4-Bike Trunk Mount,"This is the first bike rack we've owned and I don't see why we would get another one anytime soon. It was very easy to unpack and setup; probably 10 minutes the first time. Straps are easy to adjust; it is very rugged; folds flat for storage. It fit 3 bikes very easily, and a fourth was a tight fit but do-able. I would recommend the rack to anyone looking to avoid a hitch-based system, for an SUV or minivan. There were more expensive systems out there, but this one works fine for us. We did try a rack with rubberized clasps to hold the bikes, but didn't care for it at all, and returned it (local sporting goods store). So this time we were looking for a simpler straight bar to hold the bikes."
4,Good for 3 bikes,"It's easy to install, it does what it should.My only concern is that it could handle 3 bikes easily, but it seems like I need to remove pedal or use additional accessory to load 4th bike, like other users mentioned. That's why I bought this one even though I just need carry 3 bikes."
5,JUST WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR!,"The bike rack attaches easily to your vehicle and will take about twenty minutes. I used it to transport THREE bikes and it may be tight for a fourth. I was pleased with the ease of ""installation"" as well as the ease of removal and storage thereafter. Keep the box that it comes in since you can fold it up and use the original box for storage. This was the first bike rack I have ever used (and bought this one after extensive research here on Amazon). I was lucky to get mine for less than $100 and note that it has since gone up a bit in price. Nonetheless, with appropriate installation (and DO glance at the directions) this proved to be a very sturdy and dependable rack. I felt very comfortable driving my SUV with the bikes on the rack. For three bikes ,,, this IS the rack for you. Particularly if you will attach it to a SUV."
5,Works as advertised,I bought this for my honda pilot suv and it works great. Sturdy construction. Have only used it for 2 bikes so far.
1,This rack is terrible!!!!,"I bought this rack after reading the ""positive"" reviews from other customers that it was easy to assemble and use. WRONG!!!!! First, it barely fit two adult mountain bikes. Second, it required about 5 bungee cords and towels for padding....and the straps still didn't tighten welll. It took about 30 minutes each time of loading and unloading the bikes. Finally, the hatchback was nearly impossible to open with the rack in place. I highly recommend just spending the extra $$ and do not buy this one!! Maybe this is okay for someone in ""Hollywood"" but not in Colorado!!!"
1,WARNING - rack does NOT fit most minivans,"I ordered this based on the amazon.com description that this bike rack fits ""most"" minivans. Well, I have a 2012 Toyota Sienna, and it does not work with it. In fact, it does not fit 2011-12 Toyota Siennas, any Honda Odyssey, 2008-12 Chrysler Town and Country or the 2008-12 Dodge Caravan. Last time I checked, these models represent ""most"" minivans, and this listing is not provided anywhere in the amazon description. For these models, you likely need either a hitch or rooftop mount.A lot of hassle to order it, unpack it, read the instructions...then repack it and re-mail it.Rack looked sturdy, but Amazon and/or Hollywood Racks needs to include better information and should remove misleading statements about this rack fitting ""most"" minivans."
4,Needs more straps,"Held three bikes, one adult 26"" wheel and two 20"" kids. Easy to set up. After to initial setup it only took a couple minutes to put HW rack on vehicle. It did fit our 2007 Toyota Sienna. On a 530 mile trip, none of the straps or bolts loosened. We used ratchet straps to hold the bikes in place as there were NOT SUFFICIENT STRAPS on the rack to stabilize the three bikes. We ratcheted from double pipe section of frame, through bikes then hooked to luggage rack on car. No shaking or vibrations.FYI, instructions said this rack will fit 2010 and earlier Siennas, but not 2011."
5,great bike rack,"the kids are able to put it on the car and take it off by themselves (teens) so it is not only good quality and attractive on the car, but very user friendly"
4,It Worked!,"I am so glad I found this item on Amazon. My 2002 Ford Expedition did not have a tow hitch and it was going to be too expensive to buy a hitch and a bike rack for the new bike I bought myself. But it fit. Make sure to check their website for the proper fit for your vehicle.It took me a awhile to adjust it to my car but once it was done you really do not need to do anything else. I was able to carry two adult bikes and 3 kids bikes with no problems.Yes, that is 5 bikes but the bars and straps are sturdy enough. It even came with a hazard flag so other cars see you are carrying a load.Great for around $100 bucks compared to the $500 I would have spent."
2,4 bikes? NO!,"First off, I purchased this for use on my 2009 Honda Accord sedan. It does not fit the trunk properly as the lower section of the trunk is plastic instead of metal. The instructions state not to secure the straps to any plastic. Regardless if this bike rack works on minivans or suvs, I still could not get 4 bikes on the rack without the bikes sustaining cosmetic damage! I have decided to return this bike rack in search of another that will fit my vehicle and more importantly, 4 bikes!"
4,all-weather bike hanger!,I am very happy and satisfied with this rack. The rear crossbar on my Honda Pilot is a good place to hook up the upper straps (the Pilot's spoiler on the rear door is made of plastic material). It's sturdy and good for a long drive although it looks tight for four adult bikes. I could also use it to hang my bikes in the garage during winter.
4,Great Bike Rack,This bike rack has been great. It is very sturdy. The bikes do not move at all. It is easy to install and deinstall. I have used it 6 times since I bought it and am very happy with it. I borrowed other bike racks before I purchased this one and this bike rack is built way better. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating was because it would be really hard to fit 4 bikes unless some tires come off. I find it perfect for 3.
5,GREAT!!,I think this is great!! i really didn't want to add a hitch to my hybrid.. not only the cost.. but it is just stupid since a hybrid can't pull anything. I was worried when i found this model if it would work.. but there were not alot of options. But i love it.. it is great.. fits perfect and is very steady.. i just think it is great that you don't have to take it off to open the back.. you can just leave it on.. makes life much easier!! The directions are crap.. but it is pretty self explanitory. just put the hooks on and tighten the straps.. no problem.. and they give you extra straps for the bikes so you don't have to worry about them moving around.
2,Not a great T-shirt,"First off, they are paper thin. Maybe some people prefer that. Also, they are too short. I have a medium build and am 6 feet tall and no one seems to make a white T-shirt that can tuck into my pants. Furthermore, this shirt requires unreasonable washing requirements considering it's basically underwear. It requires that you wash it in cold water and dry in low heat and no bleach.On the plus side, there is an attractive polo logo on the bottom of the shirt. I guess that's why they are a little pricey too."
2,Thin with bad collar,"The shirts are paper thin, the collar will ""collapse"" after a couple of washes.I like my white undershirts to ride a little higher up, at least closer to my neck, these collars sag down to the top part of my chest."
4,Great to entertain toddler while toilet training!,This is a cute story that our toddler takes to read to himself while sitting on the potty chair. Whatever works.
1,So So,The unit has to be recharged 2 hours per week. Most weeks I have to do it two times a week. The alarm will start to go off if not charged all the way. You can only use a 60W light bulb also!!It is good to have it in your garage. But you have to charge it a lot!!!!
2,DuPont Screw-In Self-Charging Smoke Alarm,The alarm has many limitations as to where it can be used/activated. It can't be used in a lamp with a lampshade. The other lighting in my home in incompatible with the unit.
4,easy play,It is a good book for a new swimming teacher to give students different courses in watersports.
5,Amazing food!!,"I bought these as a present for my 19 month old daughter. I needed food that was extremely realistic and also durable. She's very into pretend play and that's why I needed food that looked real. After reading all of the reviews, it was down to this set and the 101 piece set from Step 2. This one may cost more but, it's totally worth the money and there are so many pieces of good food. I also like that most of them are healthy foods. The reviews for the Step 2 product were not nearly as great as the ones for this set. My daughter plays with it every day and has even learned about a few new types of food and what they are called. This is definitely the best set of play food out there!"
5,Worth the money!,"Well worth the money, and I do admit it's expensive. The food is extremely durable and realistic. Like the kind you would find in Asian store windows. And the variety is wonderful. Don't get any other kind!"
5,Best Food Set Ever!!,"I bought this to accompany the kitchen set I bought for my 2yr old. After seeing the dissapointing selection of play food available in stores I was ecstatic to find this set. The food is life size and is comparable to the play food used in children's museums. It's made of thick rubbery plastic look realistic. It is very durable. I can imagine it lasting for many future generations of children in our family. It also comes with some cool food items like tacos, asparagus, and sushi that are not seen in other sets.Another plus is the absence of the crappy canned food and the minimal amount of junk food (just two slices of pizza, not 10). Of course there is some cake and ice cream cones (you gotta have the cake!) but there is also a lot of vegetables and fruit. The sandwich stuff is pretty cool too. There are slices of bread, lunch meat and cheese to construct your own sandwich.Bottom line, this is a top quality food set that will stand up to many years of play."
2,CHEAP!! Not worth what it costs!!,"When I checked out play food by this very company a couple years ago (before my daughter was old enough for it) it was well made. Somehow, in those couple years they must have changed how the product is made. My kids LOVE to play with play food and I thought i would invest in better quality ones to replace the cheap and cracking ones we had. I purchased it for Christmas and almost didn't even open it to check it out but I did to show my husband. So glad I did because it was NOT the same quality I had seen them produce a few years ago. The painting on it was off and just plain not ""on"" on some pieces. So cheap! Not worth the almost $100 for play food so I returned it immediately. I wouldn't pay any more than $25 for this tub!!"
4,Simple and Easy,"This book is quite an entertaining scientific book and is easy to read. Although a couple of the answers may be outdated now, such as traveling faster than light, the book still has a lot of great useful and totally un-useful scientific concepts and information that are spoon fed."
4,"great grind and brew machine, DISPLAY ALWAYS BREAKS","Really like our capresso Machine, that being said, we are on our second and it needs replacing now too due to the display being broken AGAIN. We drink A LOT of coffee so we are always getting fresh grinds, and the taste cannot be beat. But beware of the display, it will break. also has to be held over the sink for the first pour as it spills. Going to try the thermal carafe one now...."
2,"Poorly designed, but cute","The good features about this machine: it's cute the way it swings the filter and makes your coffee from freshly ground beans.The bad features are many:1. The keys get sticky rather quickly - can't really clean them well even with alcohol. LCD panel died later. Unfortunately, this machine is totally unusable without the control panel.2. It's bulky and tall - it's not going to fit every countertop3. It's inconvenient if you like to drink different coffee depending on circumstances. Stand-alone grinder is more convenient.4. The coffee that it made was never superior to the one made by (much) cheaper coffee makers."
2,Breaks easily,"Worked okay for 1 year. Like others, not hot enough. Grinder broke then machine stopped working. Lot of money for only 1 year use."
1,poor quality of display,"I have had this coffee maker for 14 months several months ago numbers on the display started going out now they are all out, the machine still works but I have to measure beans into hopper and push start twice to get them all to grind, after reading other reviews and talking to friends this is a common problem. Way to much money for a machine that is going to last a year. I emailed the company with problem they called the next day, sent me a return ups label, I shipped on a Wednesday and got my coffee maker back the next Wednesday. Hopefully the company can correct the problem with the display however I got great service even though it was 2 months out of waranty."
3,"Good Coffee, but....","I bought this product about 6 years ago. I was impressed from the first brew. The coffee was great! The freshly ground beans seemed to make the difference. Then as time went by, certain plastic parts of the machine began to warp from heat exposure. I've had to replace the cover over the ground beans twice already. It has always leaked a little water and as time has worn on it leaks pretty badly today. Out of 10 cups of water we rarely get more than 5 cups of coffee. In the beginning the loss was less than a cup. The condensing steam flows out from the chamber directly over the ground beans and down the outside of the chamber. It's not corrected by cleaning or any other method we've tried. It still makes pretty good coffee, but I'll be looking for another type when we need to replace this one.+"
2,"Good coffee, bad display",We have had the coffee maker a little over 2 years and brew one pot a day. After using it for 12 months the display started to quit functioning and became blank in about 30 days. We have continued to use the coffee maker since we spent so much on it but have finally given up.Seeing the others here that have had the same problem it is clear this is a flaw.We are going to go with a different manufacturer.
5,Great cup of coffee,If you enjoy a great cup of coffee that grinds and brews this is the product for you. Having had the Cuisinart grind and brews for just about 5 years I was looking for something different. Cleanup was a hassle and very messy. With the Capresso 454 cleanup is a breeze. The only parts that need cleaning is the basket and the cover for it. It took about 4 pots of coffee to find the right strength I enjoy. About twice as much at the Cuisinart the time saved in cleanup and a great cup of coffee makes up for it.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I decided to try this one when my Melitta Mill n' Brew finally died and figured that for the two hundred dollar price tag, it was probably good. Bad decision on my part.PROS: Looks great, coffee is really hot, unlike some coffeemakers and their lukewarm coffee. Quieter than most when grinding. Customer Service is exceptional.CONS: The grind seems to have one setting...coarse. I am a home coffee roaster and the beans I buy and roast call for a finer grind. I tried doing a grind and putting back in to regrind, but this did nothing except clog up the thing and make a mess. The ""strong"" setting makes much weaker coffee than we are used to. Also, for a two hundred dollar unit, it is very cheaply made. Be very careful with the pouring spout...very poorly constructed = MESS.After a week of frustration with this thing, I put it away and went and bought another Melitta. The $60 dollar Melitta is a much better value."
2,"Easy to use, but makes cool, weak coffee.","We bought this grinder and coffee maker combo to replace our Cuisinart Grind and Brew (which was a mess to clean and quit working after 9 months). This Capresso machine is very easy to use and very easy to clean. Unfortunately, the coffee is not hot enough for our standards. Once poured into a cup, it cools VERY quickly. Also, because the grinder measures out the amount of coffee to be ground for each pot, it uses less coffee than we would choose for a 10 cup pot of coffee. The result is weak coffee. We are returning this machine and purchasing a Technivorm machine instead."
1,"Lame, Lame, Lame","Totally Dead, just 13 short months after purchase, and frankly I'm releived. If you like strong coffee, or have to make a pot for a group, then this machine isn't for you. The water dosn't get hot enough to truly bring the flavor of the beans out and the grinder doesn't produce enough grounds for a full pot of stong coffee. The manufacturers standard (and only) response is to use less water.The parts fit together poorly, especially the basket. While not a chore to re-asemble, I cant say the things just ""drop right in"".This machine eats coffee at an alarming rate. If you purchase this unit, like I did, you will need to settle for using somewhat of a excessive amount of coffe or inadequate amount of water to get your brew tolerable.My major complaint is about myself. I should have returned it the day I got it."
4,"Great coffee, great service",This unit makes great coffee--ranging from one cup to ten. I especially appreciate its ability to automatically both slow the brewing process to make one to four cups of the proper intensity and to lower the hot plate temperature for such small volumes. You can even choose from three brewing temperatures.Capresso is still working out problems with the clock display but I've found service to be completely hassle-free.I highly recommend this machine and Capresso.
3,"Great performer, inferior plastics","Overall a great product, all the features you'd want in a single appliance. My only critique would be that the grey plastic piece used to house the control buttons is made from an inferior plastic that becomes brittle overtime and breaks. I've tried to contact the manufacturer over their webpage and have sent e-mails explaining the problem and have not yet heard from them."
1,Good Coffee-maker - terrible customer service,"Got this coffee maker as a wedding present. We've been happy with it for a while until a few months back when problems with the ""elegant, illuminated white-on-black display"" started to go on the fritz, with some numerals not activating. Through frustrating, we could live with this.This morning, I tapped on the display, hoping to get it to work again. Rather than working again, it fell back into the coffee maker. Figuring I could just open it up and pop it back in place, I turned the unit over to find proprietary screws holding it shut.I called Capresso for help with this and was told that I had to send it in to Pennsylvania for repairs at a cost of $45 (almost a quarter of the original cost of the machine, and more than enough to buy a new coffee maker and grinder of almost any other brand). Outside of that, they would not help me.As far as I'm concerned, this is a total, catastrophic screw-job.Thanks for nothing, Capresso."
4,Nice Brew,"Took quite a while to find the optimum settings, but once I did, I love this grinder. Easy to clean, not overly noisy like some grind and brews. The burr grinder really does a great job.I do wish the settings for flavor/strength were a bit more granular though. It seemed to be one extreme or the other, and eventually, had to go with less water too, so best I can get out of it is 8 cups, at the strength I like.It really is a good brewer though. Definitely worth the money."
4,Great cup of coffee,"Purchased this coffee maker after extensive research and have not been disappointed. This is an easy to use maker that produces extra hot coffee. The coffee maker itself seems ""flimsy"" for the price but does what it is supposed to do. Definitely the best coffee maker I have ever owned."
2,"Two Bought, two broken","We've had 2 of these machines, the 1st when the model was initially introduced and it was the only grind and brew on the market. We were delighted with the concept, as neither my husband nor I are good at measuring coffee to make the perfect cup of coffee. The machine made a really good cup of coffee with little fuss.Alas, the first machine ceased to function (the arm would no longer automatically move from the grind position to the brew position). It broke at a time they were introducing the new model, so it took a while to be able to find a new one. Once we did find and buy machine two, despite having light use, it is now broken as well--it no longer heats water and sends it to brew.These are expensive coffee makers to have such poor longevity. We will buy no more."
2,Weak coffee,"We previously owned a different Capresso coffee maker that made fabulous coffee, so when it broke after many years, we bought this model. Unfortunately, it's nowhere as good. If we use the same amount of coffee we used with all other coffee makers, we get weak coffee. Also, as many reviewers mentioned, the temperature is not hot enough. Given how expensive this coffee maker is, it is definitely a disappointment."
3,not too hot!!,"This coffee maker is very easy and convenient. The main probem is that the coffee is not hot enough. I called the company and was told that the coffee should be 180 degrees. I checked it and it was barely 165. They were willing to let me send it to them for repairs. Well, I was dissappointed that after spending $200.00 on a coffeemaker that it wasn't in perfect working condition. Sending it back cost time and money, and no coffee while they ""repair"" it. Why should I have to get it repaired, it should work right from the start. I would have been better off buying it from a local store and just returning it for my money back. Very dissappointing."
2,"Great coffee, poor quality and poor customer service","I bought this as a gift for my wife and she loved it, at least until parts of the LCD display began to disappear -- now we have to guess how many cups it will make, etc. I contacted Cappresso, and they will repair it for only $75 -- which is more than 1/2 the cost of a new maker. Given how common this issue is in reviews, it's pretty clear this is a design problem with the coffee maker. Bottom line; makes great coffee, but a good chance that your LCD will go bad and then you are stuck. This is our last purchase of a Capresso machine."
5,The best coffee machine,"This was a great purchase for me... great value, great quality.I enjoy it every day!"
2,I like it despite its problems,"I have experienced some of the same problems that others have already listed:1. Temperature and brew time are substandard.2. The display started losing some of its elements some time ago.I've had it for about four years and have not had any other problems, but it averages less than a pot a day.It is incomprehensible that Capresso makes such a piece of junk and expects you to pay a premium price.Still, I like it for convenience and taste so I'll look seriously at the new version but I will approach it like its Made in China. They definitely haven't earned my loyalty and only merit my recommendation that you spend your money elsewhere."
1,Save your money,My husband bought this coffee maker for my birthday last June. For about 6 months it worked perfectly. Now it has started making the coffee so strong that it looks and tastes like mud. I make 4 cups in the morning and have had to pour it out because it uses a half of hopper of beans. We called customer service and they told us to send it back and they would send me another one. The one they sent is worse than the one I returned. My husband called today again and was spoken to very rudely by a customer service rep. Would I recommend this coffee maker to anyone...NO.
1,Overpriced,I have owned this coffee maker for approximately 2 years and today the display disappeared. When trying to turn the coffee maker on it automatically turned itself to the lost power setting. After a few minutes the machine started to grind all on it's own and started smoking. Had to rush to get it outside. A call to Capresso customer service got me the comment that the machine could be repaired for the cost of $75.00 plus shipping. Needless to say the only place this thing will get shipped to is the landfill. Save your money.
2,Didn't work for me and had to return,"Bad luck most likely. Didn't like how the ground coffee had such a long path into the filter - the grinds could be from a day or two ago (not ""todays grind""). Unit had to be returned due to non functioning cup level control."
4,So good I have 2,I liked the Capresso so much that I ordered a second one. I had both for a number of years and when the first one got too old I replaced it with another Capresso. I have tried other grind and brew machines and got rid of each of them because they just didn't do the job. The capresso makes great coffee whether you grind or just brew coffee.
1,Not worth it--just a big hassle,I've had this coffee maker for a few weeks now and I'm returning it tomorrow. I've tried everything but it makes luke-warm coffee. I even called Capresso and they told me that their coffee makers brew at 180 degrees. Well I put my candy thermometer in the pot this morning and guess what? 160! Way off from where it should be. It's a great design but they are missing the most important part...good coffee. Guess I'm going back to a Cuisinart which at least brews a great cup of coffee.
2,Disappointing gadgetry,"Well, what can I say. The thing worked. At a pre-set time in the morning, the grinder would commence and the coffee would brew. I didn't have any trouble figuring out how to work it. I'll have to admit, it was kinda nice to wake up to the smell of coffee without having to do any work.Couple of problems, as before mentioned: (a) the grinder didn't grind the coffee fine enough for my taste; and (b) the water wasn't heated high enough: I'd have to nuke my cup after adding milk -- ridiculous. So while the device worked consistently, it made consistently mediocre coffee.Like another reviewer, I buy my coffee beans green and roast them myself. After going through all that trouble, why would I drop the ball at the end of the process? I now happily use the vacuum brewing method.Ultimately, I didn't feel this machine was worth its price."
2,Have purchase 5 of these,"We bought one, loved it and after several years bought a new one. Also, bought one for my Mother-in-Law, Sister-in-Law and Aunt. The digital readouts on all four machines have broken within 6-18 months. Capresso says we can send the machines in for repair at a cost of around $100.Four out of four machines bought at different times tells me that this is a design flaw. Capresso clearly knows about this, but is unwilling to fix the problem. By the way, this only seems to apply to newer machines with the orange/red backlight."
1,timteach,"I have had this coffee maker for about 2 years. After about 1 year, the display slowly started to die but I could still discern # cups I wanted so I dealt with it. Now it is totally dead and although the machine still works, it is worthless because I have no way of programming it. Way too expensive a machine to malfunction so quickly."
3,Picture Shows Camera and Accessories but not Included,I have not installed and used the software yet. A number of reviews elsewhere indicate this is one of the most user friendly programs. The picture indicates that the camera and accessories are included. They are not. I figured the price was too good to be true as most sites list the full package at over $100; some close to $200.
2,Reminds Me of Costume Jewelry,"This is a nice set of earrings for a reasonable price. However, on the backside of the earrings, the words ""Made In Thailand"" are stamped in letters large enough to easily read. While the earrings will hang so as to conceal this gaudy stamp most of the time, it will become noticeable over the course of the day.This product could have been an exceptional buy, but the tasteless stamping on the back of the earring itself makes this reminiscent of a child's play jewelry."
2,Eh not what I expected :(,I got the earrings today and they don't look at all like in the picture in fact they look cheaper than what I paid for so disappointed
3,"Pretty, but not heart- like!","Very pretty , but quite flat and look more like leaves than hearts! Very shiny - think I will enjoy them!"
2,Earrings,"I had these on my wish list for a long time and finally ordered them. In the picture they look much more substancial then they really are. They are super light and flimsy, and would be better for a small child, not an adult earring!"
3,"Pretty, but not like the picture.","I do like these earrings. The only thing I warn about is they are not like the picture. They are not two toned, and they are quite thin. However, catches the light and pretty - just not well depicted in the picture."
2,Not What It Looks On Display Image!,"Well, I purchased it for my wife thinking it was 2-shaded earrings[as looked in the picture]. However, it's plain sterling silver. It's bent from the middle that gives a shade in some conditions. Moreover, it's extremely thing and the doesn't worth the money!"
3,Just what it says....Basic,"I have used the 1980 edition of this book. The main thing I liked about it is that it provided both the Pinyin and the romanized transliteration, which I assume is Wade-Giles. Each English word also includes the simplified Chinese character to help when trying to communicate with Chinese friends.What I didn't like about it is that it is very basic and I would often find myself going to a more complete dictionary to find many words, but hence they would only give the Pinyin. Having both transliteration methods in this book made it much easier for me to get close to the correct pronounciation.My Chinese friends found the list of words in the simplified Chinese characters by stroke count too limiting. They would often prefer to use a more complete dictionary...or their handheld translation computers."
5,"NOT just another ""How to succeed in biz book""!","I've read a lot of business books over the years, but the title of this one intrigued me. This book is a real wake-up call as to why a business or a department isn't dynamic and prosperous. It's full of down to earth practical tools and great examples from companies like Southwest Airlines, See's Candies, etc., that show you how to get your business going the way you really want it to. And the solution to making these positive changes is not a complicated, time or revenue consuming task... Dr. Nelson explains how to make noticeable improvements in every dimension of your business by simply paying attention to your businesses ""attitude"". It sure makes a difference to my bottom line."
2,Maybe good for ambient light in a power outage??,"I am a flashlight nerd. I have maglites, surefires, princeton tec... I have a 3500 lumen portable spotlight. This light is nowhere near them as far as output. I would guess maybe 15-20 lumens. The throw pattern in flashlight mode is not smooth at all.The design of the light is decent. The housing seems fairly sturdy, the switch seems a little flimsy and the handle is adequate, but not sturdy.It's not really practical as a flashlight, but I could see this light as being handy in a power outage as a light to light up a bathroom or make sure you don't trip over the couch. I think if you used it in lantern mode and sat 5 feet from it, you would not be able to read a book. I am guessing it will run for a very long time as it uses 4 D batteries and puts out so little light.If you are not very particular about your lights and have good eyes, this light is probably okay to use for blackouts."
2,There are better choices,Does not produce the amount of light you would expect from a 4D lantern. The lantern is just ok. I have purchased a LED lantern at the same time and the LED one is a million times better. The LED lantern was $30 but worth the extra money.
3,Just a flashlight,This is my second of these. It does not seem as powerful as the old one. The bulb in weaker and the variations less pronounced. I said its just a flash light the old one was a better.
2,Good Intro but everything else stinks,"Geisler builds the best straw man models that I have ver seen. He presents a general explanation of each of the models of ethical decision making. The problem is that he makes sure to highlight the weaknesses in all of the models except for Graded Absolutism. There are weaknesses in that model that he didn't deal with. Geisler chooses a pretty good model but doesn't give fair representation to the other models.Geisler does the worse job of applying these models that I have ever seen. He makes a lot of assumptions while writing his book. Geisler cites many numbers and statistics without citing a person. Once again he builds great straw men in his arguments. He doesn't give a fair representation to the opposing opinion.I recommend getting this book, only if you have to."
5,Very Useful!,"Particularly the abortion section,or it seemed to me anyway,as I've gotten in some discussions over that lately. The bit where Dr.Bernard Nathanson(now anti abortion,he was one of the leading proponents in the early movement)admits that the info about ""tens of thousands"" of women dying in back alley ""coat hanger"" abortions was a fabrication rather interesting. Looked at the ""further reading"" section at the end of the chapter and it suggested Nathanson's ""Aborting America"",he also has others available from amazon,as does Norma McCorvey(the real life Jane Roe) that should prove interesting."
3,Christian Ethics or Geisler Ethics,"Read this as a required text in a Christian Ethics class. I was hoping to get an objective view on different Christian ethical viewpoints. What I found Geisler doing was bringing all viewpoints to his own . . .eventually. He attempts to lump everyone into six categories while suggesting that his is really the only plausible one. Still it was a good start for class discussion and is a safe read for those who will still think on their own and not just assimilate the last book they've read as their own personal world view.The book is basically broken down into two parts. The first part outlines the six ethical postions mentioned before. The second part addresses current ethical issues in society; abortion, homosexuality, assisted suicide, separation of church and state, and ecology among others."
1,Silly pseudoscience.,Biorhythm theory was a silly pseudoscientific fad of the 1960s and 1970s. It has been the subject of over 100 scientific studies and the results are clear: Biorhythm theory is totally invalid. People belive in it because of selective memory and other cogitive illusions.
2,"horrible songs, not nearly as good as vol 1",Not as good as vol 1. The songs are slow and not catchy. The whole thing is not as well done.
5,Very enjoyable,I bought this dvd for my 3 year-old granddaughter. She sat through the entire video and watched carefully to pick up the different signs. She tried to teach her 5 year-old brother a few sign. She watches this video almost everyday.
5,fun!,this series is a fun and effective way to teach your children sign language. i have been looking for a long time and have not found anything that compares. watch out! you may learn some sign language too.
3,"This is the only Signing Time I would ""unbuy"" if I could","We have 6 or 7 Signing Time DVDs (I'd have to go check). This is by miles all of our least favorite. It just didn't draw me in and the kids were totally uninterested and never ask for it. Everyday Signs and My Favorite things (and both Baby Signing Times we have - 1&2) are my favorites - couldn't pick one out. My kids just LOVE the Zoo Train and even though it's not my fave, I love seeing them sign the animals at the zoo. This one, I would skip if I could do it again."
1,A must have for ALL PARENTS!,"I have all of the Signing Time DVD's.. and this one is a must have! It's fun to watch and learn WITH your child! I have a 20 month old son that has full hearing and he can't live without these videos! He signs all day long! The songs are wonderful.I had downloaded ""Beautiful Day"" from the signingtime.com website before the DVD's were released and my son went CRAZY for it! I LOVE the song. It's so poppy and happy. Besides the ""LMNO"" song from the Vol. 5 ABC Signs, it's my favorite!I can't say enough about these DVD's... BUY IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
5,can't get enough Signing Time,"We just received volumes 4-6 of Signing Time and we love them! We've had volumes 1-3 for over a year and my 4 and 2 year old still love to watch them. Now that we have the new DVDs my daughter just can't get enough of them. I teach infant sign language so my children know a lot of signs, but since we've got the new Signing Time DVDs their signing skills have picked up so much! Both of my children are hearing and very verbal. . .I know that signing has played a large factor in their amazing vocabulary and signing skills! Our family HIGHLY recommends Signing Time!"
2,"""Maze"" by Catherine Coulter",I have to say that I found this book to be tiring and boring. I usually love Catherine Coulters' books and find them hugely entertaining. I'm sorry to say that I had to stop reading this particular book about 1/3 way through; something I seldom do. I hate paying any amount of money for a book that is a disappointment to me but that's exactly what happened in this case. I DO NOT recommend this book to anyone. Sorry to be such a pessimest but you did ask me to review this book!
3,The Maze,I like the series. A friend suggested these books. At some point in most of the books (so far) the story has too many conflicts.I may continue to read because they are easy.
3,Just O.k.,O.K. story. Not very good writing. Very suprised at how popular this book is and how many people recommend it. Primary characters not developed very well. Secondary characters seem to be better developed. I felt like I knew Lacey's mother better than Lacey at the end of the book and the mother isn't mentioned very often. I wasn't dissapointed the book was ending which is a big indicator to me of how good it is.
1,Constantly Amazed,"Why did I ever finish this book? I have to agree with the reviewer from CA - the dialog was so adolescent, I was embarrassed I was reading it. The continual unrealistic character building of potential suspects was, frankly, unbelievable. Subplots were never resolved. I often felt I was reading the writings of a teenage author. For example, the cheering and high-fives by the police and FBI following the killing of 2 men, which had just brutalized 2 women, was juvenile. After the shooting of one man in the 'back of the neck', blood pouring out of his nose and mouth, the victim continued to carry on several paragraphs of perfectly coherent conversation, with better grammer and vocabulary than he displayed through-out the book. I have to say this was one of the most disappointing of Coulter's books I have read."
2,An amatuerish book by a professional writer.,"Much of the story was too contrived, although interesting for light reading. The building of a maze at so many locations seems unlikely -- and with his income? Also, a good editor would not have let so many errors slip by. For example, on p.35: She hit shorty in the breast when she was aiming for the throat."
4,"Action, mayhem - the Maze satisfies","Despite nightmares and a near nervous breakdown caused by her stepsister's murder at the hand of a serial killer seven years earlier, Lacey Sherlock has abandoned her dream of a career as a musician and has become an FBI agent.When, as her first assignment, she is attached to Dillon Savich's Criminal Apprehension Unit (which uses a specialized profiling computer program), she has the chance to work on the case that has obsessed her, and finds herself irresistibly drawn to her boss. Coulter's suspense is well drawn, and the action of the story helps to overcome any plot weaknesses.Susan Eriksen's reading is spirited and emotive with effective character vocalizations.Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc"
5,Kept me wondering how it would end,"I enjoyed this book. It was funny, suspenseful and exciting. Catherine Coulter made me care about her characters, and what would happen to them. The maze and the madman who built it were scary and I found myself holding my breath at times. Great reading - I couldn't put it down!"
3,"Flawed, but fun","This is a fun book if you're not too analytical and don't try to make it match reality. The repartee is very good; the characters are unusual; and it's bloody satisfying to have a female character going after a serial killer with every intention of blowing him away. But the factual innaccuracies are jarring, and the number of wacko characters defies belief. So just ignore the little voice in your head that says ""It just doesn't work this way!"" and enjoy."
5,Loved It!,Very well done. Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire way through. The end just left me wishing for more. I hope that Catherine Coulter continues to write books such as this. This ones a keeper folks! Enjoy!
2,I'm Confused,"I happened to buy the Kindle combo of The Maze and The Cove. Now, The Cove was terrible, so this book comes off a little better in comparison.The thing that bothered me most (besides the plot holes, lack of suspense, and telegraphed ending) was the dialogue. The characters speak in short, unrelated sentences that come off as stilted and lame. Every character speaks that way. I don't really know why the author writes dialogue that way.Anyway, save your money. There are much better mysteries out there."
1,Gothic romance wishes it were _The Silence of the Lambs_,"A reader could hurt herself, falling through all the plot holes in this book.Do you enjoy being treated as though you were stupid? i.e., being expected not to notice all the hanging threads and gratuitous plot twists? Do you enjoy a book full of ludicrously unrealistic characters? Do you enjoy abusive ""romantic"" banter? If so, this novel is for you!"
4,"The Maze is Twisting, but Good","I bought THE MAZE because I am an avid reader of Coulter's fiction. The story was predictable, yet I found her characters fascinating and in the grand scheme of things Lacey had the right to pursue justice in her own way. I was glad that Coulter continues to write both historical and current fiction."
1,Oh Puh-Leeze,"I didn't like this book - not the premise, not the characters, not the writing. It was ludicrous from beginning to end. The dialogue was not well written at all. The ""plot"" (if you can even find it) had huge holes in it. The intimacies would not be allowed. Lacey's maverick behavior would have been nipped in the bud right quick if this was anything close to real. None of the serial maniac stuff was even close to convincing. And a real cop out ending. And it all happened in a week or two???? Give me a break."
1,juvenile,"It's a Nancy Drew Mystery with sex and violence. Absolutely the worst adult thriller I have ever read. Characters are unbelievable, dialog is juvenile, and the plot is totally predictable.Once I start reading a book, I can usually finish it no matter how much I hate it. However, I found this one so embarrassing that it was all I could do to finish it."
2,Thriller?? More like a fairy tale.,"I was introduced to this series by a friend, she said that I would like it. Well, I'd have to disagree with her. The story is basically crap filled with plot holes.The characters are two dimensional, and the dialog is miserable. I died a little inside at every turn of the page. The book is described to be a thriller, but I guessed correctly through the story... there's nothing surprising, or even interesting. I don't know what else to say about this book than it's crap. Hope the Author has a second job.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE."
3,Early characterization shows,"This book is the first in the Sherlock/Savich series, and though I've read others, this was my first insight into how they met. I was really interested in the mystery/crime portion, however, the romance and character interactions left me cringing. I know the characters are better than that, I've read other books where those same characters were alive and 'real' - but here they just seem hollow and silly. And though I did cringe through the love scenes and stupid conversations, I was interested enough in the meat of the story to plough through it. And it was worth it. This book had me second-guessing my second guesses! I wish the author would go back, now that there have been several books in this series, and rework the characters a bit. Then it would be a very, very good novel."
2,Predictable,"this book is a romance novel which happens to have a long, drawn out, immature plot. The charactors are too perfect, their hokey methods are too on-the-money; nothing appears real.Memo to the author: if you want to write a romance novel, write a romance novel.. all the games the charactors played in their 'heads' were too much.murder mysteries make great entertaining reading; but when mixed with romance, it takes the edge (you so despartly want) away,out"
2,"Crackerjack of a story line, but:","This was my first Catherine Coulter book. I was very intrigued by the synopsis on the cover and thought I would have a very good read. I had a first rate disapointment. The story line was superb, but the dialogue was stiff and just not believable. The characters were not fleshed out. I am not a professional reviewer, but if I were, I still could not have given this book anything to boost it's sales. Sorry."
1,Catherine Coulter: Hypocrite with conservative blinders,"In the first book, The Cove, I ignored the one or two references to ""liberal judges"" and read on. In this book, however, there were too many to ignore. CC makes a big point about how ridiculous it is for a judge to take into account the fact that the bad guy in the story was viciously abused as a child. Yet in both these stories, the female victom is suffering from repressed memories from her youth which drives her behavior and we are led to sympathize with her. Isn't that a bit hypocritical?"
4,I loved the book,"I really liked Dillion and Lacey. I wish that Lacey's family background wasn't so negative though.. Maybe that helped her out later on?Maybe..I did not think that the dialogue was dumb or juvenile as some reviewers have said. I thought it was cute and funny in some places. Lacey reminds me a lot of Clarice Starling in this book. I admire her dedication and her passion for her job. I don't approve of her going off on her own to get her sister's killer though,that was dumb,and Dillion was kind and understanding and patient in helping her. I do wonder how Lacey got into the FBI with this need to help catch her sister's killer though,shouldn't someone in security doing the screening seen that and had a duscreet word with Lacey about it? I'm sure that she is very capable though,she just needs to channel her rage into something more positve and constructive."
1,Unbelievable premise and childish writing,"This was a truly terrible book. I've never been a fan of Catherine Coulter, as I find her style of writing simplistic and silly. But I picked this book up in my sis-in-law's place out of sheer boredom and was quite disgusted at the end of it.The serial killer's method of killing was completely far-fetched and unconvincing. Lacey's character was immature and the contrived dialogues didn't help one bit."
4,Edgy,It's one of those books you can't put down. Loved the characters except Douglas and Candace but then again they absolutely deserved one another. Can't wait to start the next book in this series!
3,Perfect for the beach!,"Catherine Coulter's The Maze was fast-paced and fun to read. I couldn't put it down and kept lauging aloud at the dialogue. While not as substantial as say, Silence of the Lambs, nor as believable, it still packs a punch. Perfect light reading."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I thought the writing seemed to skip around too much, and too much time was spent developing secondary characters only to have nothing come from most of the build-up...Also thought the attraction between the two main characters was too underplayed for a romance novel.The suspense was ok...but here again thought it was tied up too loosely."
3,high waist,"Love the material, love the color and for the most part like the style, but it fits too high on the waist. It would have been helpful if the description had mentioned that it has a high waist."
5,Whoa!,"After listening a bit to Uncle Tupelo, my first Wilco album was Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. I thought, ""Jeez...where the heck did THIS come from?"" Then I heard their amazing album Being There. Besides finding myself completely blown away, I was amazed by the way the band's sound changed. But I think Summerteeth really surprised me most with its twisted pop that seems fluffy at first, but is dark and deep when you rip into it. A lot of reviewers talk about the Beatles when discussing Wilco; What's Beatle-esque about Wilco is the creative arc the band as experienced across their four albums."
2,It's okay...mediocre...be dubious of all the Fan Frothy,"There are two above-average tunes (She's A Jar, Via Chicago), a bunch of re-hashed mediocrity (ELT, How to Fight Loneliness) and some rather syrupy and/or pointless clunkers(Shot In the Arm, Summerteeth YUK!, I'm Always in Love, In a Future Age). The sound is brittle and amateurishly over-produced. The band plays without any soul whatsoever and the arrangements are gimmicky and distractful (a common recording trick when you're dealing with a poorly written song in the first place). Some lyrics are intelligent and beautiful (""And freeze to spread skeleton wings/I passed through before I knew you""), while others are trite and dopey (""You followed me down/the neck to D""). In short, there are far too many run-of-the-mill songs on this CD for it to merit such unquestionable, ""album-of-the-year"" praise. Look before you leap and borrow a friend's copy before you buy."
3,Sound and Fury,"This third effort by Jeff Tweedy and company has undeniably arresting sound that draws a mood of eeriness and moral uncertainty. And in the first few listens, I bought it hook, line, and sinker. But the more the album played, the more I began to sense that the obtuse lyrics were a ruse; an effort at sounding poetically observant and detached that actually came up empty of any real feeling or purpose. It was as though the band was so caught up in experimental, retro, mood-enhanced music that it thought it would throw some compellling-sounding words to an entirely uncertain concept. There are a couple of moments where the words do have a sense of purpose (ie-""Via Chicago."") But a lack of purpose to some finely-crafted songs, leaves the album as an artistic concept, devoid of a true soul."
5,One of the best CD's I've heard in the last few years!!,"Every now and then you buy a CD and WHAM! you can't stop listening to it. Listen to this album all the way through then listen to it all the way through again. I believe it's a masterpiece. This is one of the best bands around right now. Yeah, ""wall of sound"" and all. I've late to discover Wilco, mainly through ""Mermaid Avenue"" (one of the best CD's from last year), then found ""A.M."" at a 1/2-priced store and fell in love with that CD. I just can't get enough of ""SummerTeeth"". Great melodies (with at first bizarre off-sounding insturmentation that actually falls in to place everytime) lyrics that make you ponder, a theme running through the whole thing (or is there?)..... I'll take Wilco as the sparse alt.country sound of ""A.M."" and the Beach Boys/Beatles/XTC influenced layered sound of ""Summer Teeth"". Keep on truckin'! See everybody at the concert in San Antonio with R.E.M."
5,Get Over It.....,"Okay so this is no ""Being There"", but this is a successful evolution of that album and it is terrific. Could very well be the best album of the year."
1,Wilco = Sell-outs,"Overproduced and sounding like every other damn record out there today, Tweedy and friends have bolted to the mainstream for the pot of gold, always just out of reach in country-rock, but now, unfortunatley, well within their grasp. There goes the only band I still liked..."
1,Cheese on par with Andrew Lloyd Weber.,"It's pretty clear from this album that Jeff Tweedy & co. are too old to make vibrant music anymore. They know it too. They took the desperate step of switching from one derivative formula to another derivative formula in the hopes of making music fun for themselves again. They tried, but they failed. It's too bad. At one time, Tweedy genuinely believed in his schlock. More than anything else, this sincerity was what made his music worth listening to. I think it's become bloated posturing. No more. No less.I wish they would stay at home with their families and write commercial jingles. They could earn lots of money and they could do it anomynously."
1,Summer Teeth is very dull and lifeless,"I was looking around to listen to a few new albums and bands and saw some good reviews of Wilco. What a disappointment, this album is very DULL and lifeless, the sound quality is very poor up against the latest offerings from other bands recently e.g Robert Cray and Tom Petty."
3,"Good, But Musically Derivative & Lyrically Nihilistic","I just recently got interested in Wilco, due to the hype at the local NRP radio station in Detroit about ""A Ghost is Born"". But I was forewarned to first start with Wilco's more accessable music...hence I bought Summerteeth (via Amazon.ca). While I was initially intrigued, I gotta say the highly derivative musical styles (yes, they are quite varied) and cynical lyrics with a nihilistic bent, really left me with an overall sense of inauthenticity and lack of identity about this CD.I much prefer the other highly-tauted disc I bought at the same time - Modest Mouse, ""Good News for People Who Love Bad News""... my first time listening to them. While I will seek out earlier MM, I am now hesitant to explore more Wilco...PS. I do really enjoy Uncle Tulepo's stuff...Cheers."
1,WHAT A MESS.....,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?? IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WILCO MAYBE STRETCHING THEMSELVES THIN WITH TOO MANY PROJECTS AT ONCE (MERMAID AVENUE- WITH BILLY BRAGG). DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS HODGE-PODGE OF MEDIOCRACY.
1,Can't tell you how much I hate this CD,"As some of the other reviewers have stated, I really wanted to like this CD. I keep putting into my CD player, but by the 4th song I can't stand it anymore! This CD has a very cheesy, hokey sound with silly lyrics that I just can't get into. I really can't see why it has received so many good reviews. Save your money!"
5,A Stepping Stone,"Wilco has turned out yet another masterpiece with what has become an increasingly experimental weapon in it's musical arsenal: the Lennon/McCartney-like partnership of Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett. Though they split after the entire Yankee Hotel Foxtrot fiasco, both left their mark on this record.And why shouldn't they have? The fervor surrounding this record was enormous. Wilco had broken out of the gates with Being There, and then followed that with Mermaid Avenue, a project with Billy Bragg and Woody Guthrie.People expecting a return of the ""alt.country"" legends were surprised to see a newer, sleaker form of Wilco emerge from the studio: Jay Bennett was making his mark with his mastery of production and sonic exploration. This album represents Wilco at a crossroads: ""My Darlin'"", written by Bennett and arranged by Tweedy represents what was happening: A full on partnership between to great musical minds."
4,"Summer teeth: one of many, but still as great","I have been a long time Wilco fan, without even knowing it. In the past few years i have been keeping up with newer albums (Yankee Hotel/A ghost is born) but only recently stumbled upon Summer teeth. Once i listened i knew it was another classic. Following suit with their newer albums summer teeth offers one or two up beat (semi-kitchy) tunes that at suface seem radio friendly, but with deeply meaningful lyrics that often catch me off guard. Though Wilco isn't for everyone, Summer teeth is deffinately for any Wilco fan."
5,It Doesn't Get Much Better Than This,"I discovered Wilco purely by accident. But now I know there is, in fact, a God. At first, I thought that musical perfection was impossible - but I was wrong. Dead wrong. ""Summer Teeth"", the extraordinary slice of heaven in compact disk form, is an amazing collection of songs. Defying any conventional methods of catagorization, Wilco has created their own genre of music and set the standard for bands everywhere -- too bad so few people have heard of them.""Summer Teeth"" has a song for every conceivable emotion. Frustrated? Mellow out with ""When You Wake Up Feeling Old."" Sleepy? Get dancing with ""Can't Stand It."" Or cry as you sing drunkenly to ""We're Just Friends."" I know I sure did.Bottom line: you won't be complete until you own this album. Fill up that dead, hollow space in your tummy, and make a well-deserving band a few well-earned dollars."
4,this one'll grow on you,"Well, I must say that I am very pleased with the album as a whole. The rockers like ""E.L.T"" really sting you, with innovative arrangements and driving power. Though, I must say the best parts of the album are these. Songs 7, 8, and 9 are a mini-tragedy, hitting home with sweeping movements are gut-wrenching lyrics. They just sound like pure emotion. The other is the remix of ""A shot in the arm"" that concludes the album. Crisper and edgier than the first version, it really is the best shot that the band has at a hit. It'll be a shame if they don't release it. Anyway, I hope ""Summer Teeth"" sells so that these guys get the recognition that anybody reading this knows that they deserve."
2,very disappointing,"it's very disheartening to watch an entire genre of music sell out. one after another, alt country bands signed to major labels all of a sudden think they are rock, or even worse, pop bands. guess that's where the money is. sure isn't where the quality is. thank god for son volt; at least one half (always was the better half) of uncle tupelo is still playing true roots americana music."
3,"Great pop, but not ""alt.country.""","I like Wilco, and I like this CD, but it's pop music, derivitive yet quoting from the best of the genre. If you are looking for an alt.country style CD, this isn't it, but if you love Jeff Tweedy and his pop artistry you'll enjoy Summer Teeth. I still like A.M. best of all the Wilco CDs - guess I require the guitar to be more up front (and it helps that it's Brian Henneman on A.M.). I listened to Summer Teeth all weekend, and though it has many good hooks and catchy melodies, the whole CD does not catch me."
5,"On new record, Wilco evolves into true pop.","Wilco's third album ""Summer Teeth"" should come with a warning for fans wanting to hear the sounds of the so called alt-country scene Wilco helped to create. The album stays true to its influences, but moves ahead into a sound which defies its earlier recordings by forging a lush combination of classic Beach Boy's harmonies with synthesizers and hard rocking arrangements. Principal songwriter Jeff Tweedy no longer sings of ""Casino Queens"" but of the newfound family life he longs for while on the road. The songs ""She's a Jar"" and ""Via Chicago"" test the very limits of political correctness, as love songs and frustrated unconscious thoughts wrapped as one. ""Always in Love"" has the good time, rocking feel of a Creedence song mixed with the pop mentality of the Beatles . The song, like the others on the record, including two ""hidden"" tracks, leaves the alt-country movement screaming ""traitors"" and the pop rock community with a gem of an album."
4,Willcall,"This cd is one I grab when my mind hits a music blank.And I never regret putting it in, I only question why I didn't do it sooner."
2,What a disappointment !,"I listened to this record and the first thing I thought was, what a boring music is this.I think the album ""Bein' There"" didn't sell not enough records so they came up with a very commercial album. I think ""Bein' There"" was a very fine album but when I heard this one I thought by myself why are these guys are goin' the easy way. Think again, and make a classic album. I know Wilco can do it!"
3,An Ok cd,This cd is fair. I've heard worst and better cds. Its worth a shot if you like Alternative rock.
3,It's a bit... Meh.,"In my opinion Summerteeth is overrated. In it, Wilco's music has changed from something unique and beautiful into average pop music. I prefer Yankee Hotel Foxtrot far better than this. Many of the songs are the type that have a melody which is hardly memorable.Also, the sound quality isn't that good. While it is better than other popular albums, it sounds too trebly and the levels are a bit too high.Yankee Hotel Foxtrot beats this in every single way in my opinion."
3,finding their voice,"It goes without saying that their current beatles\brian wilson obsession is infinitely more compelling than the Rolling Stones fixation that dominated the first two albums (save and except the wonderful ""sunken treasure"").At least the beatles \ brian wilson preoccupation is focused more on borrowing an approach to production rather than stealing a sound. Having said that, there isn't a song on this album (with the possible exception of ""She's a Jar"") that I wouldn't have preferred to hear in its original ""demo"" version.Still... it's a positive step towards finding their own voice. I just hope that they don't fall into the pretentious experimentia of Radiohead."
1,Record warped and skips,"I have read many complaints from those who have bought this item that the first song skips on most turntables. My copy skipped several times and the area of concern was warped. The main offender appears to be the song Can't Stand It, which is now kinda ironic because that is exactly how I feel about this lp. Could be a bad pressing and doubt it had anything to do with the lps treatment during shipment since copies were purchased in multiple places.IMO"
3,Summer who?,"The best tracks on the album are ""Pieholden Suite"" and ""Via Chicago"". Not that it's a bad album - it's not - but nothing really stands out and bites you in the butt. ""How to Fight Lonliness"" sounds like it should be on a different album. The lyrics are good, after listening to the entire record a couple of times you can feel a tint of hopelessness. It's middleground, but there's diversity, which make it convincing to keep, especially for their catchy rhythms."
2,"Great songwriting, annoying production",I bought this CD completely expecting to love it based on all the good reviews. This could be a great record but it is absolutely ruined by overproduction. It has constant left to right to left pans of various instruments -- like some kid was playing with the audio board. There are layered synthesizer effects which are absolutely annoying. If this record were stripped of these effects it would be quite good. As it is I'm going to re-sell this ASAP.
2,Where's Wilco?,"There were maybe 2 or 3 tracks on this CD that were even close to ""good"". The remainder was like Herman's Hermits meets the Beatles meets Moody Blues and ran the gambit from bubble-gum to downright sappy. A true multi-layered, overproduced effort with none of the small studio-jam feel of, say, ""AM"" or ""Being There"". Bring Back Wilco!"
1,Very disappointing,"I got this album because of Mermaid Avenue, which I thought was an excellent cd. Jeff Tweedy wrote wonderful music to Woody's lyrics, and so I thought I would check out a Wilco album. Summer Teeth sounds like bad eighties music and outtakes from the Beatles White Album. The songs sound so cheesy and generic. Not at all what I was expecting. Tweedy may be a gifted lyricist and songwriter, but when the music sounds like this, who cares. The sound is too electronic and modern sounding, and a couple years from now will sound really silly and dumb."
2,Not what I expected...,"I really wanted to like this record, especially in light of the glowing reviews it recieved, but it just didn't do it for me. I loved A.M. , and I admire the band for trying not to stagnat with the same sound again - but all the keyboards and over-production makes this sound more like some forgettably bad eighties pop band. There are a few cool tracks, but overall, it wasn't worth more than a few listens."
4,My LP is fine...,I got a copy that plays perfectly. Very low surface noise and no warping. Sounds amazing actually. Just saying...
3,Non-fanatics beware. . .,"The true measure of an album is the number of good songs, i.e., the specific songs you will still want to hear after the initial listens. Here, there are four: ""Can't Stand It,"" ""She's a Jar"" ""Shot On The Arm,"" and ""Always in Love."" Non-fanatics might want to check out Wilco's debut, ""A.M.,"" which has the same number of goods songs, but performed without all the studio wankery."
4,Good pop record,"Not the ""masterpiece"" it's often described as, but a good does of American pop circa 1999.I enjoy the darker, edgier side of this band when it surfaces. Which is why I like Son Volt so much better. Evidently Tweedy was the McCartney to Farrar's Lennon in Uncle Tupelo, arguably the best American band of the last decade."
5,"The boys, the boys","Is there anything they can't do? Every last number on ""Summer Teeth"" resonates with a love of songwriting and playing that four in every five artists just don't have. I hated to see Uncle Tupelo break up, but just you name another band that split into a pair of equal talents. Wilco will be recognized as one of the greats, soon enough."
5,"This album is sad, beautiful","As a long time Uncle Tupelo fan, I'm delighted that Jeff Tweedy can still manage to move me in new ways. His willingness to experiment (though often with a nod to his influences) is refreshing. This album is new, fresh, and though it's only been out for a couple of weeks, it seems destined to become a classic."
4,"Anything Wilco does is worth listening to, but...","OK, this is one of the great bands working today, and you have to give them credit for not repeating themselves. Wilco makes certain that anything they do will be interesting, and Summerteeth is growing on me a bit... BUT Tweedy's incredible voice is often buried and distorted and the whole sound of the thing reminds me of a pretty bad ELO or Beach Boys experiment. Interesting, listenable, but ultimately this may be one of the weakest spots in what should be one of the strongest catalogs in rock by the time they call it quits. By the way, this is an incredible live band!!! Unfortunately the winner of the best ""third post Uncle Tupelo album by a former member"" goes to Son Volt for Wide Swing Tremelo... and I didn't think that was possible after hearing the brilliant ""Being There""."
3,A few Missing Teeth,"I have listened to this album four times at this point and although I enjoy it, the album misses the mark I had anticipated it to hit. The albums ""Being There"", ""Mermaid Ave."", and ""Down By the Old Mainstream"" are all absolute classics. This album and ""Weird Tales are not. The latter are both very good, intelligent and creative but perhaps a little more contrived rather than an unconscious flow of musical genius. I do like this CD, It just feel short of their other Wilco and collaborative work. Thank you Wilco for once again mixing up your musical themes, not bowing to ""The Commercial Market."" Never make a conventional ""pop"" CD."
3,Not too bad... and it is PAL.,"Not too bad, but not great as is the Out of Control tour concert--the sound isn't as well done (mixed; vocals could be cranked up a little more) and the show in general is not as visually entertaining as the Out of Control concert video. In other words, if you are going to buy only one Girls Aloud concert video, I recommend the Out of Control concert live at the O2 instead of this one. Unless you must have the songs featured in this concert instead I suppose... Nevertheless, this is still pretty good, although in hindsight I probably wouldn't have purchased it. But I just had to find out what format this came in to see if it would play on my North American PS3. Doesn't the listing say NTSC, and isn't that what I want? Anyway, the one I received is in PAL format and my PS3 will not play it. My PC will play it though..."
1,Didn't Work Either,"I have this concert on dvd already and loved it! For christmas i got a blu ray player for a present so right away i went and ordered this. Like the other 2, it did not work on my blu ray player :(Ill see what amazon can do for me, im quite upset over this:("
2,Not compatible with Sony players,This title is not compatible with Sony BD-players and PS3.Some other region-A players of other company could play this title.You can see same problem when you play 'Keane-Live' and 'Andre rieu'.
3,WHAT HAPPENED!,"I have all three of the ""US"" videos. This one is the worst out of the lot. I agree with ""POP LOVERGIRL"" Their band and GIRLS ALOUD did not mix very well at all.For certain numbers you hear the BAND & GIRLS ALOUD ,would just have to scream the lyrics out.And of course it also worked the other way! Who ever PRODUCED this show, He or she DID NOT DO A GOOD JOB AT ALL. THe GIRLS were singing up a storm and some of the effects were nice. But to do justice , I would recommend "" OUT OF CONTROL"" OR GREATEST HITS TOUR-WEMBLEY""."
3,"Well, mine is region A.","Hey, I live in Brazil. I don't really like the Girls Aloud, but I bought this just for try. Look... My Blu-Ray player is American, right? So it's set to only play A-Region BD! I bought this item on Amazon.ca, not on the USA one and it works fine... No problem at all. Now, I don't have a PS3 console, so I can't say about it... But as for my Sony BDP-S350 blu-ray player, I had no problem. I came here just to tell you guys this. Hope I helped."
5,A must have...,"Girls Aloud live shows are fantastic, this is probably my favorite concert of theirs thus far. However, I've yet to see Out of Control. Waiting for that DVD! =) Every song on here is energetic and entertaining. The girls kill it w/ Fling, Sexy! No No No, Love Machine... The list goes on. I was blown away by every single song. I was surprised by Control of the Knife, I must admit I didn't care for that particular song but then I see it live and just, wow! The girls bring their A-game! The Black Jacks performance is really good too, the dancing is great. I love the behind the scenes doc, very cute. Just make sure your DVD player can play PAL or Region 0 discs, otherwise you probably won't be able to watch this DVD. I tried searching for this DVD as a Region 1 (bc I live in the United States. *sigh* I wish the girls would come over here!), but I could not find it. So yes, make sure you can play this product before purchasing. But overall, yes yes yes buy this DVD!!!"
1,Bill Nye the Science Guy:Probability Classroom Edition DVD,"I'm a huge fan of Bill Nye the Science Guy and use his DVDs in my 6th grade classroom. However, I was truly disappointed in this DVD and several others from the math series. I expected the same innovative teaching style...it fell short; by a mile! Bill Nye makes science very straight forward, and he explains difficult concepts so effortlessly...the math series just doesn't compare."
4,_Very_ cool stuff!,"From '1967' to the 'Ancestors ...' track, this CD is absolutely immaculate. Sometimes beat-oriented, sometimes ambient ... always enjoyable and just plain great stuff! MVH is one of my heroes ..."
3,Tepid English drama,"Not a bad English tele-play. It moves dryly in the old-fashioned English drama style, with no background music to support the acting and a plot that is woven and unwoven a stream of conversations in different settings. It has decent acting and believable sets, and seems faithful to a sensibility of a classic novel."
4,Terrific Miniseries. Very Faithful To The Novel.,"The only film version of this classic love story that I've seen was the one filmed in 1948 with Vivien Leigh and Ralph Richardson. However, this miniseries is more faithful to the book (which, I'm sad to admit, I've never been able to finish reading).SPOILER ALERT!!!! Alas, the miniseries ends with Anna's death and thus omits the happy ending of the novel (typical of every version of the novel, I guess). Anna's death scene lacked emotional intensity, hence my giving it four stars.Fine performances from everyone in the cast, especially a pre-villainous Stuart Wilson (""Lethal Weapon 3,"" ""The Mask Of Zorro"") as Count Vronsky.I especially loved the scene when Anna reunites with her son after patching up her brother Stiva's marriage and when she surprises him on his birthday. so romantic. This miniseries is Not Rated."
1,Anna Karenina,Absolutely perfect! I have been looking for this version for some time and it was well worth the wait!
4,DVD quality,Not a very good copy. It's grainy so it looks like a copy that was copied off a vhs format. very disappointing
4,Utterly satisfying,"I loved this BBC series when it first appeared in 1977. Perfect casting, magnificent acting and true to the spirit of Tolstoy's novel. The only disappointment with the 2004 WEA DVD that I bought was the faded colours. Nicola Paget's unforgettably blue eyes were washed out and the staginess of the sets showed through without intensity of colour to camoflage shortcomings. This series is too good to be deprived a remastering. Neverthelss, I'd recommend the DVD highly as it's the best adaptation made so far."
4,Super Phos 30 and liver flush!,"I have used the super phos 30 when I was participating in a liver, gall bladder flush. I must have passed hundreds of pea green stones. Within 24 hours of completing the flush, my energy level went through the roof. I highly recommend using this product when doing a liver flush. J.P.-TN."
4,for the 21 day detox okan,this was actually required in the 21 days detox. I am not sure how it works by itself but it worked great with the detox.
4,pretty good,"I'm Chicana, but I don't really listen to Chicano rap that much. i live in the tri-state area, and we all listen to reggaeton up here. I have to say that this guy makes me freaken proud that we have someone half decent! I LOVE the song, ""Vivir Sin Aire""! Daisy's voice gives it a mysterious sound, and S.Loco's lyrics and beats are pretty good."
3,Good concert footage. Dull TV appearances and Videos,"The concert footage is well worth the price of the disc. The 1976 material from the Siren tour shows Roxy at the top of its game. ""Nightingale"" is a real gem. But the other half of the DVD consists of only marginally interesting TV appearances and MTV videos (from the Flesh & Blood and Avalon eras) in which the band mimes to the studio soundtracks."
1,Defective DVD,Many tracts are flawed. The audio lags behind video or is missing entirely. I had expected more from Virgin Records.
3,US Release: Great Title for the Price,"The real thrill of this release is that the Frejus material is in 5.1 sound.I was surprised by how much of the material is lip synced.But this is a great release for the price.I bought the PAL version, but I'm sure the NTSC version has the same sound. My DVD player can convert PAL to NTSC."
1,How do you review a release that's not yet available?,"I don't understand how other people in America have reviewed this dvd when it hasn't been released here yet. Did you fly to England, watch it, then come home? I'm as big a Roxy fan as the next guy, but I won't give it a review until I've seen it!"
5,Excelent for beginners,This book is exactly what it says... a begnner's guide to W2K. But it does contain a lot of useful info.It is well designed and thougth out and as a training guide for employees it is great!
5,Classic Jam,Michael Jackson knocks this Jam out of the park FO SHO!! this is how MJ's Legacy as a Adult Artist went through the Roof. the arrangements&the way MJ flows on this Joint is timeless. great instrumentation. dig the way the Drums jump start this Classic Jam. this Cut is still Too Cold for a Freezer to Hold.
4,Good headphones.,"In general, these headphones are very clear. If you aren't looking for pounding bass these are fine.The only problem is...the bass. It's not very appearent at all.They will be uncomfortable at first but you will eventually get used to these.The sound isolation is excellent. Nobody could hear anything coming out of these....now could i hear anyone around me.These will not suit everyone.I grabbed these for around $30 so I'm pretty satisfied with what i got for the price."
3,Not $70 worth of head phones.,"These did not perform as weel as I had anticipated. The sound is a little better than fair and only if you have it jambed clear inside your ear. The foam ear pieces were a lot more confortable than the rubber ones. With no instuctions on how to replace or change these out, I almost destroyed them both. Getther the rubber ones off and installing the foam in ear pads.Had I known then what i know now; i would have just stuck with the headphones that came with my player. I will wait until i can afford some TC2's."
1,Incredibly disappointing,"It's no wonder they've discontinued this product. DO NOT purchase them, at any sale price, if bass response is at all important to you. They are comfortable and the clarity at the high end is decent, but the bass response is the worst I've ever heard in an earbud-style headphone. Even the slightest bass levels force them to distort radically and ruin the listening experience completely. The only possible use I could see for them is listening to audio books. Just awful."
1,"lacking earbud headphones, even at half price","DO NOT buy these headphones. they dont fit well and have pathetic bass. for the same price you can get the stellar Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (amazon has them for $47 right now but i got mine for $40) which have awesome clarity, bass, and construction, and the cord wont fall apart like sony's earbud models."
1,Fraudulent advertising,"These have no bass, and the they are clear, as long as you like high end clear.The Marketing people need to let the Engineers back in the mix at Altec Lansing.Shame on those Marketeers that try to foist these on unsuspecting consumers that think that the Altec Lansing name was what it once was."
2,Go with the Sony or other brands,"I end up returning these due to the fact that it's very uncomfortable inside your ears, and the sound quality is no better than my Ipod original earphones."
5,The perfect gift!,I did not know anything about Yoga Mudras until a friend gave me this lovely DVD. I was amazed at the power of these simple exercises! Sabrina Mesko's presentation of the mudras is marvelous. Thank you to Sabrina for bringing this ancient art to the present day. The world would be a better place if more people practiced this kind of yoga!
3,A good all-around guide to the island,"I just got back from my honeymoon in Sicily and I used this guide as well as one or two others. The book helped me with some interesting tips on restaurants and out-of-the-way places, as well as finding me a really nice hotel in Siracusa--something that made our stay there one of the nicest parts of our trip. A little light on maps if you're driving or like detail in your maps, but overall this guide was an asset on my trip."
5,Best written travel guide I've seen.,"More perceptive sense of place than any of the standard guidebook series, with witty histories one wants to read. Less discussion of precautions than student or Lonely, Rough guides, needed for completeness. I recognize those places I've been, and they've found each favorite spot I had to dig to locate. They describe how to stay with locals on remote islands where other books can only suggest you bring a tent.Beautifully printed hip-pocket paperback, complete with an(unattributed) ""Italian oldstyle"" typeface confirming these are the most cleanly attractive and readable typefaces everdesigned."
4,War Movie,"It is what it is. An early war propaganda piece. The funny things is, just a year later, almost the same thing happened at the battle of Leyte when the American escorts of task force Taffy attacked the Japanese fleet of battleships and hvy cruisers."
5,Stand By For Action,"This is one of the great ww2 movies.Good action good acting, For people who love naval battle this movie is a must have.[...]"
2,What a disappointment!,This book was painful to read. The main character is portrayed as being on a virtual oddyssey of masochism. The characters were not likable and I found myself wondering why the author of Change of Heart and Class Reunion would write such a terrible story.
3,Does everyone know everyone,"I see that most of these reviews come from people that know the band. Well I don't. This EP has something different with it.It is Hardcore but, also EMO comes to minds. I would also recommend the band that won the Battle for OZZfest, ""A Dozen Furies"". They both have the same feeling and difference in their music."
5,Light Worker....,"I'm really 17...and i didn't want to put in any info but i wanted to say something about this cd. This cd changed my life because i know the drummer and i know the bassist...and it changed their lives too...i also made the yesterdays rising group on myspace...so i know what repect they deserve...the singer DOES NOT sound like every other singer...brandon has his own indivdual amazing voice that he uses...along with Jamie's drumming, Justin's bass skills, john's amazing guitar useage, and Richie's amazing rythem he plays...this band is sight for sore eyes of the emocore scene...check out their new album comming out...""Light Worker"""
4,The Broken Hearts Club,"The Broken Hearts Club by Ethan Black is a suspenceful thriller, it leaves reader longing to know what will happen to the hero and who will die next; even though the book is thrilling it is hard for younger children to follow the lengthy plot line. Ethan Black desplays his usage of suspence in the sentance, ""She feels his hand, that smooth hand that once caressed her, and made her feel like a woman, the hand that probed inside her, the fingers that touched and excited her, oddly familiar, close tightly over her mouth."" His suspence was greatly intensified with his sentences that leave readers longing to know what will happen such as this sentence, ""She hears his footstep behind her as she reaches the counter and grabs for the wooden rack of knives."" As the plots change in each chapter some younger maybe lost until they come together. So if someone likes suspence, not knowing what is all ready known, and enjoy complicated plots then this book is for them."
1,Pathetic,"Was only able to force myself to read the first 37 pages before I decided a mind is a terrible thing to waste on trash. The dialogue is ridiculous; the characters are silly. I don't mean to sound trite, but this book is really bad."
5,Can't Miss,"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down, It cost me a nights sleep. The characters were interesting, the premise was ingenuous, I was on the edge of my seat. I'll be on the look-out for future books by Ethan Black."
1,Prurient and sophomoric,"Another millionaire detective! How original. Tired plotting, shallow characters, and a ""exciting"" finish. Everything was predictable after the first few pages. I never realized that NYC was so filled with so many beautiful, lusty, commitment-shy people driven by the demons of their past. Conflict and tension are required for story-lines, but must all the characters be doomed to unhappiness and stupidity. Is this Greek tragedy or modern mystery?None of the characters are appealing enough to make one care about them. The villian is ludicrous and trite. I found myself giggling at the ending."
2,Okay but. . .,"This book has a decent premise, and I love the detective character, but it needs some work.First of all, I agree with one previous reviewer -- the ""secret"" of the book is revealed literally half-way through the read (way too soon). This makes every move by the detective and other characters look so stupid it's not even funny. You really want to like the detective, but after reading him do some really dense things, you lose interest.I also have a fundamental problem with the book and it's secret. I think the author really needed to get himself a better editor, because there are many inconsistencies that need to be resolved.Speaking of editing, the book is chock full of poor grammar and missed/mis-used punctuation.I'd wait for the next book or if you want to read a thriller, get Mark of the Assassin by Silva or something like that."
1,Not Recommended,"This is a book whose premise had potential to be a suspenseful, gripping novel. However, none of that potential is realized. Instead, it is badly written, filled with graphic sex and descriptions of the wealth Voort and his well-to-do partner. I found myself not caring about any of the characters. There's a twist in the middle that makes reading the rest of the book almost irrelevant. I'm always looking for new authors to add to my reading list. Based on this, Black isn't going to be one of them."
1,Concept exceeds Author's grasp,"The characters are preposterous. The novel begins with a collection of broken-hearted men who are preposterous. They are involved with a crime investigated by a millionaire NYPD detective who has has a tall, thin, beautiful, blonde girlfriend with white-blonde pubic hair. You buy that?P.S. This is not a debut novel. This is an author who had a mid-list crisis and has been repackaged. Good luck, Ethan."
4,Thrilling,Broken Hearts Club was an exciting book with a strange twist. Maybe they do not wait till the end to reveal some light but I thought that only made you wonder even more what the suspect was going to do. My only dissapointment was an open ending of sorts that makes you wait for the next book. I will be waiting.
4,Pretty good but...,"I found this book to be very riveting, but I found thatrevealing the secrets of the killer halfway through this book sort ofruined it for me. I like a book that keeps me guessing to the end. For awhile I thought ""oh, these clues are so obvious"" then the author just tells you the big secret and then I found myself just reading to the end only to see how the author finished it not because I had to know. The ending did seemed hurried to me after the build up in the beginning and I agree with others that the characters were not very endearing. I also found that the sex scenes went a little to far. I would like to read another book by this author."
2,Obvious and unrealistic,"A quick and moderately entertaining read, but nothing more. One must suspend belief from the very beginning of this novel. The main character and his partner are millionaires who continue to work for the NYPD out of the goodness of their hearts. Their women friends are all 6 foot tall blonds with busy careers who find time for exercise and, of course, always sport thong underwear and have insatiable sexual appetites. And, as mentioned in other reviews, the real plot twist is revealed in the middle of the novel--making one wonder why they should bother finishing it at all. If you read quickly and are not too particular, this is a nice diversion. If you only read 5 books a year, pick something something else!"
3,Great beginning...weak ending,"Ethan Black's first novel revolves around a good premise, a weekly dinner meeting of men who have been wronged by women, held by their psychiatrist. After these meetings, some of the women discussed, end up dead. The first half of this story is fast-paced and full of suspense. I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, the second half of the book gets bogged down and once all the secrets are out, way too early for a satisfying thriller, it slows to a snails pace. But, the overall story is good and the book has one great thing going for it...a New York City detective named Voort, who you'd like to get to know a lot better. Not a bad first effort. I'm hoping to see Voort, again, in another Ethan Black thriller."
3,Nothing to get excited over!!,Normally it takes me 2 days to read a book and this one took me a week and a half. It just did not grab me from the beginning and I never got into it.
4,I thought it was good,"I don't know what everybody else is talking about I thought this book was great. I loved the characters especially Voort and Camilla. Their relationship was realistic and at times I disliked Camilla half-way through the book for being mad at Voort. I thought Ethan Black did a good job on characterization and kept the focus pointed on the story. I want to read Irresistible, but I'm not sure if Ethan Black is that caliber of a writer for me to get another one of his books. I just might be careful and try to get it from a library. But nonetheless, this book is right on and I think readers who like thrillers should read this. Go cop it.~~Special K"
3,"Pity, Pity,","The ""broken hearts club"" is a group of men who's women have dumped them. The men have been brought together by a psychologist, Dr. Brainbridge who seems to be encouraging their hatreds to grow with each meeting of the club. One of the members takes on the role of encouraging the other to exact revenge by hurting/killing the women they have loved. The detective working the case is called Con Man by his friend and partner, Mickey. The two of them are the two riches cops in the city which doesn't seem to have a lot to do with anything in the story, however Conrad Voort's biggest connection to the plot is that his own lover has just told him that she wants out of their intense relationship. As he begins to investigate the murders his concern for his lover grows as he finds that she is going to the psychologist who is hosting the Lonely Hearts Club meetings. It's a plot with a twist but one that has been used elsewhere with more depth and interest. The book is an ok read."
5,You'll never want to date again!,"Not one to choose mystery books as a primary choice, I read this book when it was recommended to me by a friend. The idea of a club where men get together to share their broken heart stories I found intriguing. What happens next is compelling! It brings a scary new twist to dating!"
5,"best thriller I've read in a long, long time","First I missed my stop on the bus, reading this. Then I stayed up until five in the morning reading it. Now I can't stop talking about it. A group of broken hearted guys, collected by their psychologist, meet to continually tell their stories in a bar in New York. What starts as informal group therapy ends up in murder, but that only starts the twists that don't stop until the surprising end."
5,great movie for family,This movie is great f0or families to watch together. This movie has just right amount of fighting and it shows what friendship is. This movie also shows how people can come together and fight teh evil in the earth and good can truimph over evil any day.
4,Enjoyed the movies,"It is a funny, action pack movie. I used to watch the cartoons and I was very surprised to find myself enjoying both movies."
4,NON STOP ACTION,its great that they put the two movies together.But it's just the two movies two disc special editions in one box.read other reviews about them.
5,BUY THIS SET THEN GET DARK OF THE MOON SEPARATELY,"This is a great, more financially viable way to get the Transformers series. Buy this set, as it comes with the special features discs for both movies. THE SET WITH ALL THREE MOVIES DOES NOT INCLUDE DISC 2's!"
4,Great Bluray,I have just seen the first part and I am impressed with the picture and sound quality of the bluray disc. I dont know why there is so much negativity about this movie. This movie should be enjoyed without over analyzing it.
5,Very Good Offer!,"I bought this set at WalMart then went back the next day to get the 3rd movie. This set comes with 2 of the best editions of the first 2 films. Excellent movies backed up by great special features. Don't listen to the critics or the haters. The CG animations are perfect. Acting and entertainment is top notch. The only down side is the story is pretty generic. ""The Chosen One"" story can only be used So many times without becoming pointless. But these movies are PURE entertainment and worth any collection, unless your one of those nit picky people who don't appreciate all forms of film. Movies are not meant to be done a certain way, if they were then they would have 1 group of people making all the movies in the world.5 Star Product, and overall 5 star movies (The First one is good enough to cancel out the 2nd's 4 star rating.)"
3,The White Stag,This is a story that a tribe called the Huns and Magyars. They have to leave the location they are at now because they are running out of food. They are going to the promised land so they can have food and game to hunt. They would find the white stag and they would chase him but then he would just dissapear into thin air. That is the story of The White Stag.
3,The White Stag by FunkyMonkey,"The White Stag by Kate Seredy is about a tribe that is trying to find the Promised Land. The tribe believes in the White eagleand Red Eagle as powerful gods. Nimrod, the mighty god told a prophecy about the future. The other leaders were Hunar and Magyar. Slowly the tribe starts to split up into the Huns and Magyars. Hunar married and has a son, Bendeguz. The Huns likes war, they never lose. This book is happy, sometimes confusing, and took place a long time ago in 480 A.D."
4,The White Stag,"The White Stag is a great book for people who like strange fantasy. It was very different than any other books in the way Kate Seredy expressed what happened. I liked how she changed an old story of killing into an interesting plot. Before you read this book you think of the Huns as people set on killing, but when you read this book you feel the Huns actually had personalities and reasons for doing what they did. You get to find out about a hidden history and how different the Huns really were. It is a very interesting book."
4,Glad to have read it,"I enjoyed this book. It's written for a child's reading level, but I have never read it before and I was interested in expanding my library.This a legend of the ancestry of the Hungarians. Starting with Nimrod all the way to Attila the Hun. The moral of the story gets mixed up, but I really didn't see this as your typical ""good vs. evil"" or Aesop's Fable story-line. It's folklore and an explanation on how ""our Hungarian ancestors"" came to be.I'm not going to explain this in great detail as other reviewers did. It's a short story and it has many illustrations and it is worth picking up or checking out at your library."
4,A Great Story,"Through exhaustive research and interviews with the remaining Badgers, their families, and combat comrades, Frei tells the story of this team of young men who became real-life heroes by fulfilling a much greater calling. In describing their experiences on the football field and in service to their country, Frei makes it clear why the generation young men and women who came of age during the Second World War have become known simply as the ""Greatest""While some may think that this book is ""too narrow,"" ""too old,"" or ""too local,"" let me say that it is far from that. This is a story of the highest degree, one that will leave the reader at various times laughing, mournful, amazed, and inspired. ""Third Down And A War To Go"" is much more than just a football story. It is much more than just a war story.It is a story about us."
5,A great story about football and so much more,"So many had raved about this to me, on the web and in the media I didn't know if it could live up to all of that. It was even better than I expected. The friendships, the campus atmosphere in the first year of the war, the great football season involving famous players (Crazy Legs) and a famous coach (Four Horseman), and then the war experiences! When you get to the battle climaxes, you're both feeling proud and ready to cry in places, and you're also staggered because of the amount of research that had to go into this to find all of it out. Not to ruin the story, but this also shows why a lot of us Wisconsin fans think David Schreiner should be honored on the facade of Camp Randall Stadium. If you haven't heard of Dave Schreiner, you should. Talk about what this country is all about! He's it."
2,Trashy retelling of a lot of British shenanigans,"This book gives a ten page write up on about twenty of the most famous cons in (mostly) British and European history. Or at least, those spanning the past 300 years. The tales are interesting, but the writing seems labored and pressed. I can't remember the last time I read a book, let alone a paperback, with so many typos. The stories this book attempts to tell are worth telling, but not in this way."
1,A live collection of Donovan's favorites don't think so!,This is a recording of Donovan Leitch performing all his songs in concert. Try getting the studio version of Donovan's greatest hits it's much better than any other CD compilation I should know!
4,Refreshing Reptile,"A little disappointed by Pilgrim, I contemplated before I finally plonked down my cash for Reptile. To say that EC has returned to his roots here is far from right, but Reptile definitely has more to offer than Pilgrim. The change of feel is remarkable, and though there aren't too many searing solos, one has to admit that for sheer Slowhand goodness, this is great (albeit a slight deviation from regular Slowhand jamming). Superman is pure joy to listen to, and Broken Down is outstanding. And there are a good number of gems in this recording. It's not EC's best, but hey, it's not too far from it either."
3,Not Up To Recent Work,"This is a solid album, but I have come to expect more from Clapton due to the greatness of his past 4-5 releases. In my opinion, this album strays a little from the more traditional blues sound he has incorporated into his more recent work and it suffers as a result. There are about 4 real solid tracks on the album, and Billy Preston's piano and keyboard work really add a special element to these songs. However, some tracks are really unlistenable and take away from the experience. You wont regret buying this, but there are better Clapton discs around."
3,A real GOOD album,"I listened to this album a few days ago. After hearing many albums by Clapton that were very DULL, i was pleasently suprised at how good this album was. The opening song is an instumental. The first time i heard it i thought, how cheesy sounding. But after a listen or two, it wasn't bad at all. Reptile is a mix of funk, jazz, rock, and blues. This whole cd is a really good mix of songs. Although, it is nowhere near the quality of the ""layla years"". But that is the way most muscians are as they age. The reason i am giving this 3 stars is because i feel that people grade too generously, giving ever GOOD cd, 5 stars. If you give it 5 stars, what about the classic albums like Highway 61, Sgt. Peppers, ect? Anyway, Reptile is Worth buying!"
4,Not an essential purchase but still a great experience,There are a lot of good things going on here. It's not perfect but it's well worth the purchase price.
5,Slowhand slows down rocking on this album.,"Eric Clapton shows signs of slowing down rocking on this album. Many of the songs are either soul or blues. The Impressions,an R&B group once led by the late Curtis Mayfield,sang background vocals on most of the songs on this album. This album opens with the title track,written by Clapton. BELIEVE IN LIFE was a hit. Clapton covers DON'T LET ME BE LONELY TONIGHT written and originally recorded by James Taylor. Stevie Wonder's I AIN'T GONNA STAND FOR IT sounds really cool. COME BACK BABY was written by the legendary Ray Charles. All the other songs are cool. This album is packed with photos taken between the 1940's and 1970's. Clapton's liner notes explain the meaning of the title track."
2,Save your money!,"I hate to write this but this album really stinks. If I could I would ask for my 13$ back. I am a huge Clapton fan and it hurt to listen to Reptile. It is not as bad as Pilgrim, to me that was Clapton at his worst, but its pretty close. Riding with the King was such a good album and it hurts to listen to Clapton's follow up. If you do not have Riding with the King buy that CD, or keep your 13$ because this album stinks."
1,Bad stuff,"This is Eric Clapton at his worst. Very little guitar playing and what's left are his strained vocals. There is no energy on this disc. Most of it sounds like poor lounge music. What has happened to Clapton? His last two discs are weak, at best."
1,A complete waste of time,"I've listened to this disc three times trying to find something on it that appealed to me. Being a longtime Clapton fan, I was very disappointed to find absolutely nothing memorable. Sadly, I think he's finally dropped his Rock and Roll roots completely, and has landed squarely in the Adult Contemporary (easy listening) category. It'll be my last Clapton purchase."
1,"Wake Up, People!","What's wrong with you people? I've never seen so many undeserved five star ratings in my life. Actually, I must confess--after listening to the audio clips & with the disappointing bitterness of ""Pilgrim"" still fresh in my mind, I won't even buy this CD. I never thought I would say that, as I am a huge fan. I own everything Clapton has ever recorded (from The Yardbirds to ""Riding With the King"") including many compilations. The realization of what he is capable of makes it impossible for me to suffer through this sort of dribble any longer.Eric, if you are listening: don't be misled by Grammys or the thin veneer of adoration from gushing ""fans"". Neither of these groups recognized ""Layla"" for the classic that it would soon become; in fact, they've been pretty much oblivious to everything you've recorded up until ""MTV Unplugged"".You've been blessed with a tremendous talent. Use it or lose it (or at least start using a pseudonym)."
1,One good cut from many,"I only like one cut from this CD--""Believe in Life."" The rest are boring and uninspiring."
5,More instrumentals,Bought the CD and DVD - absolutely great - wish he did more instrumentals. Aslo bought a set for my best friend.
2,Not too impressed...,"I've always been a Clapton fan, but Reptile left me disappointed and empty. It's kind of blah. There was almost nothing on this entire cd that caught my attention. It sounded like not too much effort went into this recording, which is uncharateristic since Eric is known for pouring his heart into his music. The background vocals reminded me of Elvis Presley's back up singers from the 50's and seemed out of place on most tracks. I also thought the blues, Clapton's strongest attribute, came across weak and hollow. I did like Superman Inside and Son & Sylvia, though. Tried and true Clapton fans will enjoy Reptile. Even if not so much for the music, at least because it is Slowhand himself. I'd rather hear something from his past. I would give this one star muscially, but because it's Eric Clapton, I gave it an extra star. PS: Clapton is still a living legend and one of the top contributors to rock history."
3,Clapton Sliding away,"As Clapton ages he sinks deeper and deeper to his ""roots"" in the blues. I thought Reptile to lack the creativity that I have loved in his music. His themes (musically and thematically) seem stale. I have only listen to the album twice and have no desire to go back. Three stars for production quality and the fact that even stale Clapton is better than most musicans."
2,Should Have Named This Album REFUND!,"I've always had the greatest admiration for Clapton as a Guitarist going back to his days with the Yardbirds, and when he played many of the leads for George Harrison. However his singing leaves much to be desired and seems to be regressing into low-keyed mumbling. I have his earlier efforts but this one just doesn't cut it!"
4,Clapton mixes it up well !!,Eric Clapton's Reptile is a mix of blues r&b rock and folk the slow hand is masterful again the covers of James Taylor and Stevie Wonder songs are very good over all it is a very good cd.
2,From Guitar God to Kenny G,"Poor Eric. The man has made so much money that he seems to think that he can afford to sacrifice his artistic integrity and still maintain credibility with the fans who have admired his rock and blues efforts for 30 years. Who knows, maybe he can. He sure suckered me into buying this album. The meandering cocktail jazz of the opening track ""Reptile,"" the ""lite rock"" of the cover songs--this all adds up to little substance. Is this the same guy who played in Derek & the Dominos? He seems to be more in tune with Jackson Browne, Elton John, James Taylor, and Leo Sayer than Muddy Waters or Buddy Guy.This is appropriate material if you don't feel like being challenged as a listener. In fact, I hope this isn't an example of Eric challenging himself as a player. If so, he has lost it completely. If you are new to Clapton, forgo ""Reptile"" and point your browser to the recordings he made in the 60s."
2,"should have been titled ""lizard""","disappointing, to say the least. i understand this was an album dedicated to an important family member. and that the term ""reptile"" is complimentary. but with the collection of tracks on this cd, it would have been more appropriate to name it ""lizard"", as in lounge lizard. with the exception of 3 or 4 tracks that were clapton-like, the rest could have been done by any hotel bar band with a decent guitar player."
3,the relative comeback,"a great relief after pilgrim (the nadir of his career)Nice acoustic picking, nice song selection and great backing vocals. However, it's AOR or MOR or pop, it you want to be nice to the guy. It's not the Claptom we know and love (and loved as recently as From the cradle)"
4,A Blues CD from EC,"Personally I thought it was a very mello CD. Definately not on the same level as ""Riding With The King"" that E.C. did with B.B. King. Still a good CD overall. I ejoy his covers of Steve Wonder and several other artists. Probably my favorite verson of travelin' light there is out there."
3,Some Good Songs But Lacking Power,"This recent release of Eric Clapton is a big time improvement over the hip hop fused and drum machine laden Pilgrim release. Eric does explore a few cachy pop music styles and does play afew captivating solos here and there.However, there is not enough heavy guitar sounds. Superman Inside is a rare moment of Eric letting loose and cranking some amp. I can respect Eric for trying to broaden his musical styles. And on such songs as Travelling Light, I Believe In Life, Sylvia And Son, and I Aint Going Stand For It Eric is quite successful. However, Eric needs to incorporate a heavier rock n blues style into his future releases as that is what got him to the dance and that is what he does best. This release just lacks fire and power after a while."
5,Love it or hate it?,"Seems that most people either love this album or hate it, and I have to put myself firmly on the side of the lovers. Yes, this album is a mixture of styles that Clapton has come out with in the last ten years (and some faithful fans of the ""old"" Clapton won't like that) but if you loved From the Cradle, and still have Unplugged on your list of best albums, you are going to enjoy Reptile. Riding with the King was easily the best album of 2000, and this may not be up to those standards, but put this album in, turn it up, and get ready for a great time. I highly recommend."
5,Awesome,"Clapton is back with a fantastic mix of rock and roll and blues. The first track, Reptile, even adds a measure of jazz. This is a CD that is a work of a mature artist, yet with out the pretension that shows in the new work of some artists in thier fifties. It is obviously reflective of his youth and his roots. As a result many of the songs on this album have rifts remenisant of early blues and rock classics.His covers of J. J Cale, Stevie Wonder, James Taylor and Ray Charles are particular treats, but as always, his original is material is top notch."
2,Why even put this out,"I didn't give this one star because it's certailnly not his worst record, just his most forgettable. Reptile and Pilgrim would be destined for what used to be called ""the cut-out bin"". I understand that he's done it all and can afford to ""explore"", but lets get real. This music makes me think that ""Behind The Sun"" and ""August"" are really great records. Bring the Marshall back and turn it up."
2,A disappointment,"I hesitate to say anything critical of Eric Clapton, since I am such a tremendous fan and usually *love* everything he does. Maybe that is why I was so disappointed with this album. Maybe it is just me, but this album doesn't sound like Eric Clapton at all to me. The first instrumental reminds me of elevator music, some of the other tracks sound jazzy to me, and a Stevie Wonder song? The rest of the songs have too much piano and not enough guitar playing, which is why I love Eric Clapton so much. His talent is astounding! He should show it off! The two redeeming songs on this album are Superman Inside, which almost sounds like the E.C. I know and love, and Come Back Baby. On Come Back Baby, Eric puts his whole heart and soul into the singing and as a result, it is AWESOME! This is what E.C. does best: sing the blues! I just wish I loved the rest of the album as much."
1,Riding with......Otis,the only other place I've heard music as fine as this has been in an elevator.
2,Pre-retirement,"The thrill must be gone. This CD is Long, oh so very long. Don't get me wrong he is still a great Guitar player, and there is some good music on here, but it seems as though pre-retirement has begun. I must say his vocals have goten very good. As far as the Cd as a hole goes the word Lethargic comes to mind. I have been a fan for years and I am 40 years old so when I say lethargic it must be. I have watched or I should heard his music go up and down over the years, this one is a down. It would be good background music but to sit down and listen to it is a challenge. Oh by the way you may notice that I never mention the name Eric Clapton, that is because this review can double for the latest Mark Knopfler CD, word for word."
2,It's the Same Old Song ... Literally,"If you've liked any of Clapton's work in past 25 years, you'll like Reptile. Same thing, new package. There's no question that Clapton is talented guitarist (wildly overrated, but talented) and still fairly interesting for the 40+ set who still think he's ""groovy"" much in the way the previous generation thought Liberace was ""one hep cat."" Aside from the well-executed Son & Sylvia, this is a fairly predictable, paint-by-numbers exercise.If you don't have a lot of exposure to Clapton, do yourself a favor and check him out in his prime (30 years ago folks!) with Derek and the Dominos during the ""Layla"" era or 461 Ocean Blvd. There's a lot of great Clapton out there. Virtually all of it is pre-1980."
5,Great music = Great CD,"It really saddens me to see that most of the negative reviews are based on the fact that this album doesn't sound like ""classic"" Clapton from the 60's/70's. I applaud Mr. Clapton for branching out and trying different styles, knowing he'd take some heat from fans that want him to do the same stuff for 30 years straight. He's proven time and again that he can still rock and still play the blues. Why is it that an actor playing completely different roles is respected, but a musician playing different styles can be looked down upon? This album definitely has a more mellow feel to it, but just be aware of that and don't expect it to be another Layla. The songs here are sweet, and the playing superb. Listen to the samples and judge the music for what it is and not for what it's not."
4,A Strong Set From Clapton The Musician,"If your only interest in Eric Clapton is as a guitar god then this CD is probably not what you're looking for. But, if you're interested in Clapton the complete musician you'll be very happy with the results. Covering blues, rhythm & blues, rock, soul and even a little jazz, this is Clapton's most diverse collection yet. There is no shortage of guitar, just not a lot of show-off soloing.His voice is in great shape, the band is tight and the songs are strong."
4,Clapton at his bluesy best,"I am really a newcomer to Eric Clapton, this is the first album that I have purchased. I was really pleasantly surprised at the easy listening capability of this album. It is an excellent way to unwind after a long day. Tracks like ""I Want a Little Girl"" and ""Don't let me be Lonely Tonight"" will definitely put a smile on your face. It also has songs to pick you up like ""Come back, baby"", and ""Superman Inside"". If it is instrumentals you like you should know that the best in the business are Eric Clapton, with Bruce Hornsby coming in a close second. There is evidence of this in the uplifting ""Reptile"" and the truly soulful ""Son & Sylvia."" So whether you need to be picked up or wound down this is a perfect CD for almost any occasion. You'll find out soon enough, enjoy."
3,Uneasy Listening,"Fans who love Clapton for his rock and blues won't find much to like on this release. It's more likely to appeal to an easy listening crowd than to anyone else. True, he does touch on the blues on ""Got You on My Mind"", the slow, gospelly ""Come Back Baby"" (with some nice piano & organ), the old-time piano blues ""Find Myself"", & the brisk blues-rocker with a funky edge, ""Traveling Light"". The latter is my personal favorite, & sounds like something Mark Knoffler would do. As for the rest of the album, it's dominated by acoustic soft-rock & pop, along with a poor attempt to appeal to the dance crowd with ""I Ain't Gonna Stand For It"". Several tracks include annoying background vocals and strings. The album is book-ended by a pair of instrumentals; The title track a Spanish-flavored jazzy tune, and the closer a soft acoustic track. For an artist who's been considered a rock guitar legend for decades, your more likely to hear these tunes in an elevator than on rock radio."
4,Introduction to international music 101,"The story of how I came to acquire and appreciate this selection of masterful artistry. Is certainly worth mentioning. I received a single, (Material / Mantra on Axiom), from this album in 1993. It came, mysteriously enough, to a recording studio/house. Of which, I was a resident. The music was unsolicited but IMMENSELY appreciated. I certainly hope, there are many more curious souls. Who are willing to open the doors of perception and gaze into these manifestations of beauty and joy."
4,Bleak and unique,"Coming from Mexico City, Hocico (pronounced ""os-ziko"") offer a uniquely bleak take on industrial. The production is typical top-notch Metropolis quality. Behind the club-friendly beats lie soundtrack-grade atmospherics, samples, and synth work. The songwriting is pedestrian, and the vocals are on the thin side. However, these faults aren't major and only help highlight the impressive production. The lyrics really shine here, tying together sociocultural and emotional themes. Bonus points for the gorgeous artwork, which helps give the whole package a genuinely dark feel."
3,Not their best.,"Ok, I came to know Hocico by getting the Signos de Abberacion album and I really liked that one a lot. Especially Bloodshed, Forgotten Tears, and Instict of Perversion. And you find those songs coming into your head every once in a while even if you haven't listened to the CD for some time. But this release just didn't jazz me all that much. Sure the production quality is outstanding and some of the ambient soundscapes that were used are of course good, but the memorability and catchiness of the songs just wasn't there. It's almost like 1/2 of the CD is just material in the works. Get it if you're a hardcore Hocico fan. But if you're expecting songs like Signos de Abberacion, don't spend your money and download it instead lol ^____^"
3,Hocico at a crossroads?,"Hocico's recent releases haven't been quite as thrilling as some of their older material, and Wrack and Ruin isn't much of an exception. Hocico have always included several instrumentals on their releases, but this is the first time that I have found them completely forgettable. As far as club material goes, you have the requisite ""Poltergeist""-style dance track ""Born to Be Hated"" and the enjoyable ""Spirits of Crime"". The utterly juvenile ""Love Posing as a Prostitute"" is a misstep, though, hearkening back to the embarrasingly bad ""Ladykiller"" released on their most recent EP. All hope is not lost, however - it's clear that Erk is trying for more variation in his vocal delivery, and ""Ecos"" is bizarrely catchy and quite unlike anything else Hocico has recorded. Not a good place to start with Hocico, but not worthless to a dedicated fan, either."
2,Cold interpretation and staging,"Although an opera lover, I have never been a big Traviata fan. This production did not help. The decor is cold, and the acting only decent. I much prefer the Zeffirelli (film) version (cond. Levine)."
2,Gheorghiu is the Violetta ?????????? Please..............,"Please buy the Netrebko's Traviata and after we'll see who is Violetta. In this ROH production Sir Georg Solti and the orchestra are the only important issue. The singers,including sets and costumes contributes to make this Traviata a common one. Gheorghiu always looks and acts nervous and not relaxed at all, the same as in her Elisir with Alagna. The rest of the cast are acceptable in their singing and acting but only that. The stars are for Sir Georg Solti.IF YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE A TRAVIATA TO BUY, THIS IS NOT THE ONE AT ALL. NOT EVEN FREE"
1,I'm trying,"I'm trying assist this famous video because this musical theme is lovely to me. Infortunetely I live in Brazil, to much distant of EUA..."
4,very clear video. Gheorghiu is beautiful,"I enjoyed this video very much. This is a recording of a live presentation. Most impressive, apart from Gherghiu's amazing voice was the amazing clarity of the photography. My only critism is that I longed for some close up view's of Ms Gheorghiu's face."
3,Not a balanced traviata,"This production of la traviata could have been close to historic but the fact of having Mr. Lopardo as Alfredo Germont, lows considerably the level of this presentation. Gheorghiu sings and acts in a superb level, Nucci as allways is a very correct baritone, and Solti conduction is near to wonderfull. The Stage production is made with good taste. Conclussion: It is not a bad idea to buy this Traviata, although Alfredo is not close to what he should be."
3,A Traviata for the times we live in,"I am amazed at the extreme praise for Gheorghiu's Violetta. She is lovely and intense, and has an interesting voice, but is hardly the greatest Violetta in our memories.Has no one seen the video of Blanca's Violetta from the Bellas Artes with Villazon? You could not possibly view this document and not find Madame Blanca's performance less than Gheorghiu's. For one thing, the Spanish soprano's handling of the music in the first act is infinitely superior in every way. She is fearless in the coloratura, always solid in her pitch and execution, and manages to touch the heart with her desperate bravura in the face of the future she knows will defeat her.I have heard and seen many famous Violettas, and would certainly rank Blanca's equal to the best. I could not accord this place to Miss Gheorghiu."
4,the greatest violetta on video,"I must admit that Angela is Violetta. Not only is she very beautiful and delicate in the role, her voice is perfect for the part. She sings every note perfectly. Alfredo and Germont were both pretty horrible. Alfredo was decent until the third act in which he drags down angela's incredible death scene. Germont looks totally bored the whole time and actually seems quite rude when he is paying attention. What a horrible choice! This DVD is totally worth it even so if only for Angela's amazing violetta. You've got to see her."
4,You'll probably wear it out.,"This is my 5 star album of 1996. Now, I basically hate it. It's SO catchy and danceable that one cannot resist the temptation to play it out through extreme overuse. I mean, I played it at parties, in my car, for friends, for strangers, in my walkman, high, drunk, sober, I transcribed the parts I could on guitar and basically reinvented my whole personal aesthetic around this album. Picture Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter jamming with James Brown, and ""Rhythm of the Saints"" era Paul Simon, with a smooth Brazillian Samba/Forro singer, and you sort of get the picture. It works as musician's music, dance music, make-out music, background conversation music, and on and on. It's just that eventually you will get SICK of it. Still, I have no regrets whatsoever. Highly recommended!"
2,Adequate -- but too expensive for what it offers,"This video is instantly dated by the fuzzy look, the late 80s/early 90s fashions, and the presenter's stilted, infomercial speaking style.The information given is very basic. I got as much if not more information and specifics from an article in a baby magazine.The presenter speaks at a rapid-fire pace, so you have to hit the pause button if you want to make a comment to your husband or partner.What bothered me most is that each stage or aspect covered was given barely more than a sentence or two -- for instance, potty training is covered with a statement about not chastising the child's actions during this stage, then we see a 3 min interlude of a cute kid throwing toys and paper into a toilet then flushing. That's about it.I wanted much more for the money. Much more...."
3,Basic info set in old style 'video',"Offers pretty basic information on the development of infants and looks to be from the 80's though the copyright says 1993. Although I'm sure child development hasn't changed that much over the years, the whole thing seemed a bit outdated. I much preferred The Baby Human and hope they come out with more from that series."
4,Child Development - The First Two Years VHS,This was an excellent video. I used it for a parenting class for young mothers and they too found it very helpful. The format was easy to follow and the wording was easy to understand. The pictures were of real situations and were easy to relate to. The content was excellent showing the stages of development well in the time period of the video. There was some multicultural content as one of the children and his parents were oriental but I would have liked to have seen a little more as the audience was from a variety of cultures. A great review for second time parents and a valuable resourse for new parents. Well done!
1,Disappointed,"As a nutritionist and a postpartum doula, I was very disappointed with this video. It shows babies drinking juice both from cup and a bottle and gives out-dated information for starting solids. Breastfeeding is not held up as the ""gold standard"" as it should be. Some of the other information is good, but you can find it elsewhere."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book based on the (two) 5 star reviews. I found the recipes called for hard to find ingredients, took a lot of preparation, and turned out disappointing results. I intend to find another slow cooker cookbook."
1,unreliable product and customer service,Aims products are unreliable and their customer service will let you down. I have had to send the same product back 3 times. After the 3rd time they said nothing was wrong and I would have to pay to have the defective equipment returned to me. I am in contact with the Attorney General office in Nevada and have contacted the BBB in Reno. I hope they will be able to help me get a refund. BEWARE of any AIMS products.
1,Not so good,These are cheap made in China junk. If you can test and select yours or buy from a good retailer you will take one out of two back for exchange. Forget about a refund it's not going to happen.
4,Power packed,This is a great litter product for the price. It is a full sine wave 400w converter and it fits my emergency power setup perfectly.
4,A Good Beginner's Guide,"John Kalench was one of the best MLM Trainers in the Industry! I've read this book more than 5 times throughout the last 3 years, and I must say most of the content is still relevant for today's sophisticated networkers.However the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it has NOT included any Blow-By-Blow Exposé of the techniques real life Master Networkers would use to change the beliefs and behavior of their prospects."
4,Great book for learning the basics of network marketing. Mike Stokes,This book is a must-read for a solid network marketing education. Mike Stokes
4,Fiber Choice Review,"Fiber Choice Fiber Supplement, Sugar-Free Assorted Fruit Chewable Tablets, 90-Count Bottles (Pack of 2)Most Excellant!"
1,Fiber?,"This product tastes horrible, it is very chalky and the tablets are quite bulky and leave a bad taste in your mouth. These fiber tablets only provide a minimum amount of fiber and I would prefer if they were a little smaller in size. I am going to stick to my benefiber."
1,It has made me somewhat agitated.,"At first I was delighted with FiberChoice . Recently, not at all. I don't know if its the inulin or the magnesium stearate, but FIBERCHOICE seems to produce what I have called a GOOD FEVER (agitated) , even tough it boosts your immune system you might be over the balance line. I have taken 2 a day, and find my self with not to good sleep.I WILL lower my dose and see how it works. Maybe 2 a week. And I'll try some of the other fiber, cause I think fiber is good.I RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE IT ESPORADICALLY."
4,good for quick fiber,"These are a fine addition for quick easy fiber. However, two tablets provide 4 grams of fiber. Since it is recommended to eat 25-35 grams of fiber a day, I take a large glass of water with four spoons of Metamucil (powder) to provide the ""bulk"" of my daily dose. The Fiber Choice comes in handy when I go on vacation or any place else that lugging a large bottle of Metamucil is not an option. They also do taste very much like candy (sweet tarts)."
3,It's ok,"I am about 3 hrs into this game so far and up to this point it's worth the money so far. I mean you can tell it's a budget game but it's not really that bad at all.The graphics are pretty decent but the voice levels need a lot of work. A lot of the time you can barely hear the voices over the roar of the flood and such and there is no way to adjust the voice volume that I can see.The object of the game...it's seriously flooding, the city is falling apart and shaking with quakes, and you need to get the heck out of dodge! lolYou start out as a waiter named Joshua in what looks like a banquet for some mayor I think. As you are ""waiting"", all heck breaks loose and you and the guests need to get out of the city and to safety. So the adventure begins as things continuously get worse and worse.If you want something different and you enjoyed Disaster Report, then I recommend picking this one up for under $20."
2,Borning as hell,"Cheap graphic, poor controls, bad sound. These are the elements of a bad game game, too bad Agetec doesn't know this. The only thing that saves this from actual ""Raw Danger"" is the hard puzzles that are tricky. Good luck follow gamers"
2,works in a pinch,"Quick points (it's just a shaver)- cuts decently close, but nowhere near a shave- large spacing between the teeth, so multiple passes necessary- batteries don't like to stay seated, a couple of taps of the unit against the hand usually get it running again- it does look good, with a blue power light and rubberized grip- the length attachment is AWFUL! fills up with hair, has to always be emptied, which wouldn't a big deal if it wasn't so hard to remove! the intended pressure point to squeeze the head to remove the spacer isn't very effective.I wouldn't recommend this for a clean shave or a 5pm shadow. this is good for longer-bearded guys who want to shape the beard or pick off the straggler hairs."
5,Excellent Book!,"This was an awesome book, really excellently written. Either a new or vetern homeschooler can learn from this book. As my child's parent and teacher it gave me wonderful ideas and resources to go look through and eventually buy. Was totally mind improving. I soaked up the information Cathy Duffy had to share. Saved me time and money by giving wonderful reviews of curriculum and resources. I can't wait for the next updated book comes out, so I can be better informed on what has come out since this 1997=1998 resource. Parents looking for curricum or resources will be refreshingly surprised at all the fine reviews you will find inside this book."

3,"Every feature is great, except for the phone speaker","I was excited to get this phone. The screen is incredibley vibrant and the speaker phone option is great. However, when using it as a regular phone held up to your ear, the main speaker [is bad]! I can't turn the volume down low enough (all they way down) without still getting BLARING depending upon who I talk to. It's also not as clear as my 5 year old StarTAC. I love the 3G features but the quality of the phone converstation is my number 1 priority. I think I'm going to return this one..."
5,I love this movie!,"If you 1) love old movies and 2) love old romantic movies, then this one is for you.I won't go into any detail about the plot as others are more prolific than I; however, when Lord Nelson says, ""There, I've kissed you across two centuries,"" I just melt.In fact, I loved this movie so much I went to the library and checked out a book on Lady Emma Hamilton. This movie did a very good job in capturing Emma's life which very much paralleled Vivien Leigh's life."
4,True Class,"Leigh and Olivier are excellent as the famed, and doomed, Lady Hamilton and Lord Nelson. He has all the earned pomposity of a great man in a turbulent time while it is a little difficult to believe she started life in such a lowly social position. But Leigh's charms son make it clear why the scandalous ambassador's wife caused so much stir. Touching and fascinating, it could only have ben portrayed by these two masters of the English theatre."
4,Ideas for tatts,I am using this as a reference book for my tattoo business. For the reason stated I rated this a four star. This serves as guide line for what is standard for tatts in the Islands
3,A strangely uneven book,"This is the story of a group of men from Arkansas, particularly the brothers Noah and Zack, who end up fighting in Virginia during the Civil War. Jones has a hard time maintaining narrative tension -- there are moments when the reader notices something and then thinks ""wait, when did that happen?"", and the overall context of the characters' experiences is unclear, though that might be deliberate on the author's part. Through much of the text, drama is lacking somehow. On the other hand, during the last quarter or so of the text, the author seems to have been reinspired and produces some rather good writing as well as some dramatic action scenes. The end comes as a surprise and I'm not sure how I feel about it: without spoiling it, some major characters die, and while I don't object to that at all, I had a hard time with the fact that the one character left alive is one who was not well drawn and with whom it was never possible to empathize."
5,Finally! Book 2 is here!,"Really enjoyed reading Book 2 in this epic scifi series created by E. Robert Dunn. It is a real page-turning adventure in the lives of the Aidennians. Relationships are stronger and the family dynamics reveal a futuristic society with true, working values. Hints of who these people are hit ""home"", making the reader wanting to get closer to the characters, sympathetic with their plight lost in the void, and empathize with loves and losses. I highly recommend this book as an excellent follow-up to the 5-star Book 1: Last Generation. Can't wait to read Book 3!"
3,Not organic,"Good price, and good list of ingredients (licorice only), but it's not organic. It could be from China and full of pesticides or other nasties. Amazon, please start selling Traditional Medicinal licorice tea, it's organic!"
4,A return to form,"After 20 years of complaining, frontman Mark E. Smith still finds the enregy for a truly inspired performance. Unlike their previous effort The Light User Syndrome, a throwback to The Fall's straighforward rock style of the '80s, this one finds them tearing up new sonic terrain. Levitate combines rhythm section driven rock and off-kilter low-fi electronica. Smith, with renewed vigor, spews forth his always bitter and usually humorous mix of vocals and poetry. Tracks such as ""4 1/2 inch"" are so wonderfully paranoid and claustrophobic that you wonder if even the band knows where the song is going (This is a high compliment). The cover songs ""I'm a Mummy"" and Jungle Rock"" are throwaways, but the rest of the album is a fine continuation of The Fall's destruction of old rock forms and exploration of the new."
3,Takes Some Getting Used To.....,I absolutely hated this cd when I first bought it. I even gave about ten listens before shilving it for a year just to make sure that I hated it as much as I thought. And then about a year later I threw it in just for the hell of it and heard it in an entirely different light. For some reason the overuse of pop synth no longer turned me off but seemed quite interesting. Ten Houses of Eve and Masquarade are outstanding and 4 1/2 Inch is a superb hard edged Fall tune. Levitate is a unique Fall record in that it sounds like no other largely due to the heavy synth sound but in a way that's what actually makes a pretty cool piece of music. Fortunately this wasn't my introduction to The Fall but it's definitely a great supplement to the collection if you're willing to give it some time to sink in. On top of that it's almost always available for the cheap if you buy used.
3,A disappointing start to a new series,"As a few other reviewers have noted, this book bogs down repeatedly on endless expositions about the nature of the two different multiverses and their diverse cultures. The problem is that by the time you're halfway through the book you practically need a Clifnote edition just to keep track of who's who and what's happening next. And after what seems like the 37th exposition about how long it takes to travel from one end of the multiverse to the other it's to the point of ""Get ON with it!""All in all, wait until you can pick this up cheap. It's not worth the full hardcover price; it's not even worth half that. Considering I am normally one of David Weber's biggest fans, that's saying a lot."
1,"Boring, pedantic a waste of money","I seldom buy hardcovers but I was waiting for this book so... I sprung for it and promptly regretted my decision. The book is overly concerned with minute details. D. Weber has a great story telling style but I cannot believe he had anything to do with what went on in this book. It was just a big setup for the next book with plodding asides, usless digressions, forgettable characters, this book has it all.The editing in the first 50 or 60 pages left a lot to be desired. All in all a tiresome read and certainly one that will color my interests in upcoming Weber books."
2,Best way to describe it is plodding,"What started out as an interesting idea turned into a chore to read. Whenever they threw in the made up names for the various places on the two ""earths"" the flow of the story came to a screaching halt with my mind struggling to put together the clues that pointed to where on our Earth the action was taking place.It was over 500 pages into the book before they described what the Arcanan military titles actually meant. Which is to say that the book was nearly done and they were still setting up the universe. You'd think that after 800 pages something would have been accomplished but it feels like it was only the prelude.The novel could easily have been edited down to half it's current length without hurting the story. I eventually just started skimming through the second half only stopping when interesting things were happening and I don't feel I missed much.I would not recomend this novel to Weber fans."
2,Rough Book for Weber,"This is almost a first. A Weber book that I really didn't like too much (the other being Insurrection w/ Steve White). I don't know, it's an excellent premise (the Multiverse), but it's just not written well: It's a bit too slow and boring, and I felt that some of the characters were being led by the hand by Weber (meaning that they easily figured things out that should have been nearly impossible). Furthermore, there is way too much animosity between characters on one side of it (seems like it's the side that Linda Evans wrote, probably). Oh, well, hopefully he won't write too many more books that are as bad as John Ringo's stuff."
2,The aptly named Hells' Gate,"As a long time Weber fan I was disappointed by this plodding, predictable and ponderous attempt. As other reviewers noted, too many ""J"" names and way to many irrelevant details, all detailed in exquisite...you guessed it...detail. Part of the problem is with the original conceit which is parallel universes. The problem arises with both universes being complex which makes for twice as much exposition....some of which is not altogether bad, but overall it makes for slow going. There were some incongruous moments, like the trip back to Arcona during which the two lead female characters are relaxing in deck chairs--just two babes catching some rays on the cruise home and they talk about....genetics. I guess exposition is where you find it. If I had it to do over, I would wait for the paperback."
2,Disappointing!,"I really like the Honor Harrington books! I bought the Hell's Gate books in hardbound because I like the Honorverse so much.Hell's Gate is a big disappointment. I finished the whole thing and I still don't have the characters straight. This is at least partially because all of them have difficult made-up names. Had I browsed it in a store, I wouldn't have bought it because of this. I bought Book 2 at the same time but I don't know if I'll ever read it! I wasn't involved enough in Book 1 to make it worthwhile."
3,"Hell's Gate (Multiverse, Book 1)",Interesting - at the start there were a couple of times I was going to chuck the book. I dislike books where the character's names are unpronounceable. But after a hundred or so pages I was hooked. The march toward war in the crazy worlds of Hell's Gate is so logical that you have to keep reading to see how it all turns out.
2,"EXTRAORDINARILY BORING AND SLOW , VIRTUALLY NOTHING HAPPENS","This book is 800 pages long. I wonder if the writers were paid by the page and/or by the number of words. The only thing that actually ""happens"" in the book, covering at most, 50 pages, is two battles in the beginning between Arcana and Sharona. Arcana is a very advanced society based on magic. Sharona is technological, but for some unknown reason, is only at a steam powered level of technology. I don't understand why Sharona could not have had a 20th century level of technology. The balance of the book is basically 750 pages of conversations between the characters and some political manipulations. There is such a thing as having too much characterization. It was very difficult not to nod off during this book."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring....","I wanted to start reading a good series, so I purchased this book because of the past reviews on Webers other series of books. I am struggling though this book (it's HELL!), and am finding it a very tough read. In fact I put it down 4 days ago, and started reading another book by a completely different author. 0h! the relief I am feeling that I am enjoying a GOOD read again! But now I am feeling guilty about spending so much money on ""Hell's Gate"", and not finishing it. Don't spend the money on this book! It is not worth the pain and suffering."
1,"Not Weber - Nope, Couldn't Be","This has to be written by Linda Evans entirely - in my opinion: Not ""David Weber & Linda Evans"".The writing style has absolutely none of Weber's touch. Rather the writing style here is clearly based on the following philosophy and written word style:Never use one word when 1,000 words can be used; never use one sentence when 100 pages can be written; never have a clear and direct description when a meandering, redundant, over detailed background can be employed; and on and on and on and on and on.Unreadable. Not worth a yawn."
2,Sometimes...,"Sometimes when you buy a 1000+ page book, you get Shogun or The Stand. Sometimes you get... this. An interesting story, but waaay too wordy. Read a chapter, flip through a chapter of boring exposition, read another chapter, repeat... for twelve HUNDRED pages. These authors were not well served by their editor(s). The excision of about 400 pages of filler would have earned this book three stars (or even four) from me.Consider also that almost four years after release of book 1, Books 3 and 4 of the series don't have release dates yet. So unless you're vewy, vewy patient..."
2,Very OK,"A lot of time wasted in this book, at one point a character spent, I think 6 pages, walking around a room and getting descriptions of what was on the walls, the maps, everything. This book could have been pared down to about 1/3 of the size and you still would have gotten everything you needed to know from it.Very little in the way of action, but when something did happen it held your interest. Mostly talk throughout the book. I'm going to read the next book in the series, I hope it's better, otherwise I might be done with this author.."
2,ouch..painful,"As a long time webber fan to the point of buying his omnibuses (stars at war, empire from the ashes, in fury born) as well as singles, this has been the most painful of his books to read (worse than the excalibur alternative which was terrible). It reads like a prose heavy version of John Ringo's council wars. Good concept, magic versus technolgy but not really fleshed out and the introduction of too many (at this point) extraneous characters who do nothing but talk about their motivations makes this a tedious read. I ended up skipping chapters just to follow the characters I liked. Needs severe editorial help (not unlike the wheel of time books that rambled on...)"
2,Plodding,"Normally, I'm a fan of Weber's work, but this book is too flawed to keep me interested in the series.The biggest problem: exposition. There's so much of it in this book that very little interesting actually happens. This book is effectively just the setup for the next book, but without enough story of its own to stand up as an interesting read. The resulting pacing is awful.Put another way, it is as if the series bible was spliced into the text of the book by mistake.Beyond that, there are too many annoying or uninteresting characters. Other reviewers's accusations of incompetent characters are on the mark.Bottom line: Overwritten, underedited. This has been a trend in Weber's recent work, but it is particularly bad on this book."
4,"Awesome setting, hard to get into","I really like the setting of this book. The multiverse thing is interesting and the differences between the civilizations are really cool. The story is pretty good, but all too often relies on there being far too many idiots or bad men in important positions. There were just too many POVs, however, for me to get hooked. I would describe the novel as event-based, rather than character-driven. All of the important, but improbable events that take place rely on a bunch of little POV shifts. I would have preferred to stick to just a handful of important POVs.I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure I could recommend it."
3,Hell's Gate,"Not great, not bad..sort of in between. But it's missing pages 923 to 954 so as you read through there all of a sudden you realize you've missed something."
2,Failed potential,"I'm on page 900 and seriously considering quitting the book. Really too bad, as there are characters that I like, but way too much lecturing from author...like taking a history class on some made-up society that you could care less about. There are many plot contrivances that are just annoyingly absurd, like idea that an advanced culture with advanced weapons just can't conceive of the idea of flight. Wish I woulda read reviews before buying this dud >.<"
2,Disappointed,"As a fan of Weber, I expected a good read from this book. High tech meets magic. Grim battles, political maneuverings, the works. Unfortunately, this book is a series of slow-moving descriptive text with a few short battles and a smidgen of political maneuvering wedged in. After the twentieth or so painfully detailed description of just how angry the citizens of one culture were at the other, etc, I think the readers got the point. I'm sorry, Mr. Weber, I read for a thousand pages but just could not finish this one."
3,When is a book not a book?,"When it's a platform for a new series. About 50 of the 1205 pages have some action. The rest is page after page of educating the reader on the multiverse geography, geology, meteorology, zoology, sociology, technology, chronology, theology, phsyiology, ideology...this becomes real work, like studying up on a country you plan to travel to. Hell's Gate has no ending; it just stops in mid-scene. It might as well say ""Continued in Sequel.""Weber's usual strengths are here -- the characters are deep and real, appropriately motivated whether they are admirable, evil, or dolts. You are fully immersed in the too-rare action sequences. But the rest of this series had better be worth it -- I have paid my dues."
3,Booooorrrring!,"David Weber is my favorite author, and I really love military sci-fi. Not this time. If this was a stand-alone book, I'd recommend a pass. Since it isn't, and the next book in the series, HELL HATH NO FURY, is quite good, go ahead and read it, but don't do it in bed. Too much information, too many names and places to keep up with, and not enough action.BAEN books should really keep a lid on this sort of excessive author meanderings."
2,Boring Gate,Found most of the book incredibly boring. Lacked a good editor. By the end I was hoping for a nuclear winter to put everyone out of their misery.
2,Cliffhanger ending,"For the most part I enjoyed the book. I tend to like action, so I found the long descriptive passages somewhat tedious, but the overall story was good enough to more than offset that, and there was plenty of action. What really annoyed me was the cliffhanger ending. I generally like series. (I am really looking forward to the ninth book in C. J. Cherryh's Foreigner series, due out in February.) But each book in a series should be self contained. I think it is unconscionable for the authors to write an 800 page book (far too long anyway) with essentially no ending. The book actually ends with the statement ""Watch for Hell Hath No Fury"" (the next book in the series). I think it is fine for the authors to want to sell the next book in the series, but that does not remove their obligation to their readers to produce a finished product."
1,The only book by David Weber I ever hated!!,I bought this book because it was by David Weber -- big mistake. I have read everything he has ever written and loved them all. I read this book to page 200 or so and never could get into to it.
2,Very much on the tedious side of things,"Normally I love David Weber books. This one was slow, and those were the fast parts. Not digging this series. I'll read it but not going on the 'reread' list."
1,"Lordy, this is awful!","I like David Weber. A lot. But this, this is just terrible. Page after page of people peering into one another's eyes. All of the female characters bursting into tears at the drop of a hat....again and again, and again. Heroic male characters who the average trooper wouldn't follow to the local waste water treatment plant, let alone into battle. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere."
2,Not even close to the book...,"When it comes to books being made into movies-I always give a lot of leeway...EXCEPT when they take the whole of it (rather than just parts) and rewrite the story and characters! If I had never read the book, it IS entertaining-but the ending is way too predictable and abrupt. Everything there catches your eye but it never goes further than that. Wish I hadn't spent $14.99 on it! :\"
3,Great if you like Ska and Scream-o,"ok so i got this cd because J Mann from Mushroomhead is one of the singers. BUT, it sounds like a mixture of the beach boys and a scream-o band.i do like this cd but i would say to check it out before you purchase."
2,Boring,"You have to have a very open ear to music if you plan to buy this album. The first song I heard from this album was ""Famine Ghost"" a good rock/pop rock song. I had high hopes when I finally bought the album.The song I sampled was nothing like the rest of the album. While listening to it I felt bored and felt that the songs just ran together.It just wasn't my cup of tea, I reccomend downloading a few songs off of it first before you decide to buy."
3,Mr Bungle,"This album is pretty much a blatent rip off of Mr Bungle's California, it just adds a little dash from a terrible band named Mushroomhead.While some of the ideas sound good it just makes me think id rather listen to Mr Bungle's California. If you want to hear a band that takes a large influence from Bungle but doesnt make a blatent rip off check out Estradasphere, they are far more talented in every degree.If you have a terrible taste in music and love mushroomhead or dog fashion disco this will be a great album to start out with."
2,This One is Really Creepy! :O,"I realize I may get a few ""unhepfuls"" for this one, but...Substrata 2 is SO not like the original ""Substrata"" by Geir Jennsen. Disc 2 is rife with bent pitches and creepy minor chords that pang strongly of The Blair Witch Project and work by Vidna Obmana, just really eerie and dark. There album is void of melody and left me totally creeped out, and therefore, I cannot listen to it again. I understand that some people may not agree with me, and I am cool with that, but I am disappointed. The only redeeming quality of this album is that Substrata Disc 1 is included, which is much better than V.2, ""Man with a Camera"".Now if you want to talk about a really GOOD Biosphere album, then I highly recommend ""Microgravity"" which is a much better representation of the Mr. Jennsen's talent and full of upbeat, contemporary and futuristic melodies. Much, much better. I respect your right to disagree, but disc 2 was too creepy for me."
1,What was I thinking?,"How did I get suckered into buying the trash?? Normaly I like ambiant CDs. Such as Steve Roach or ...hell any one else other then this bunk. To me it sounded like the sound trak to a student film, a bad student film...a second graid student. Just a colection of random noises and a few wisps of music every so offten. I didn't find this relaxing in any respect. From the reviews I read, I thought it have more of the ambiant qualitys of Michael Shrieve. I would recomend any thing by Phillip Glass or Patrick Hearn. I know alot of people realy liked this, and I'm alone,(*see how many think my reveiw is wrong.) but realy, this was just boring. This may have been what others found relaxing, but,for me, this was a dud."
3,Fun to see once.,"I saw this one as well years ago when I was very young. More nostalgia for me, it's always neat to see big actors started small once too. The movie is neat to see how people really acted back in the day as well. Funny hair do's and talking like hippies as well. The movie is kind of neat too but pretty boring for today's standards."
4,Just say in once...please!,"Fantastic information in Fife's book. He gives readers options by giving different ways to detox while explaining how each diet works. The book is set up in such a way that a, in his words, ""faster"" can quickly refer to specific sections with little trouble...this is quite helpful. With that said, I would like to mention the REDUNDANCY in this book. My God, The Detox Book could have been much shorter if the author had omitted certain repetative points.So, in all--good book, just skim over the ""broken record"" portions."
3,unsuitable for people with weak adrenals,"while i'm sure this author has the best intentions, he neglects to point out detox may not be for everyone, especially people with adrenal fatigue. ppl with adrenal fatigue need to maintain steady blood sugar levels, which means fasting is no good, and also detoxing itself can be taxing on the adrenals.for myself, i followed his advice on the liver flush, and felt much worse after doing it. i had constipation, indigestion,and was very weak for a week or so. even now, indigestion is still bothering me. i think these problems were dormant, but once my adrenals were so weakened by the liver flush, they all exploded to the surface. i feel it is somewhat irresponsible for the author to make it as if detoxing is the way to good health for everyone. for some, they might have to build up their adrenals first."
3,worth study,"Take Lonesome Dove, add Shane, substitute Will Penny for the main character. Microwave 3 minutes. Serve immediately.It's too bad this movie invites comparisons, because it's worth watching once. There are no major mistakes. What the film suffers from is mediocrity: the screenplay, the casting, the acting, the music.For would-be screenwriters, the movie is worth studying to try to find ways in which the screenplay could have been improved (and they are many). For this exercise, comparison with Will Penny and especially Shane would provide plenty of clues."
3,Falls Short of Potential,"(actual rating: 2 1/2 stars). This could have been one of the great westerns of all time. Good story, great music, incredible scenery, best gunfight sequence of any western (they even used realistic gunpowder). Acting was decent: Duvall was superb, as usual; Jeter was great, Costner was pretty good, Bening's part in the script was weak but she pulled it off OK. The bad guys, however, suffered from poor acting, particularly the evil rancher and the sheriff.The problem with this movie, though, is Costner's fixation with making an ""epic"". He's just not good at it. There were many, many dull scenes and pregnant pauses that should have ended up on the cutting room floor. The whole scene with the town flooding (cowboys laying down planks to cross the muddy street, etc.) was irrelevant to the story. At 2 hours, 10 minutes or so, the movie is about 25 minutes too long. Edit and re-release it and it WOULD be an absolute classic!!"
3,Not so wild,"This movie had its moments, but for the most part, I felt that I was trying to survive thru to the end where I would at least get to witness a fun gun fight. There was some nice character development and for the most part the movie stayed on its feet, but it is not a movie for those that lack patience.This was not one of those over the top Wild West shows, definately more down to earth. I personally enjoyed some of the cinematography and locations that were used and I always have to respect a period piece since they can be very difficult to pull off. There could have been a little more excitement added at times, but for the most part, it was an alright movie."
4,Open Range - Gotta See It Partner!,"Open Range is well worth a Sunday afternoon at the movies. The scenery from the very opening to the very end will have you asking, ""where is this place?"" I stayed for all of the credits just to answer that question. It was shot on location at Stoney Indian Reservation in Alberta Canada. Absolutely beautiful. Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall are your idea cowboys- rugged but gentle, serious but funny, subdued but passionate and so very handsome. You can't go wrong with a cast like that. Where's my cowgirl outfit?"
4,Great Movie,"I found the slow pace of this movie to be refreshing in a sea of nonstop-inyourface-action-allthetime productions. The extra time allows for excellent character development, and you begin to feel at one with the era. And if that isn't enough for you, the scenery is enough is to keep your eyes fixated on the screen.The climax is well worth the wait, with one of the best shoutouts I have seen since ""Heat"".Robert Duvall was fantastic, Kevin Costner was very good and Annette Bening was not-so-good (IMHO). Nonetheless, this is a great ""guy-flick"" even for someone who is not normally a fan of the Western."
5,Open Range DVD,I got this for a nursing home patient. It was good quality and is provinding many hours of enjoyment for him and others in the facility..
3,Formula Western - Better Than Most,"As an actor in westerns, Costner ranks up there with Clint Eastwood, slightly below the Duke, in my mind. ""Dances with Wolves"" forever earned him that title. The acting in this film is great. But when you boil it all down, it fits the genre of the Western so well that little is left to the imagination. This is not a criticism. This is not bad. It only describes the film and predicts who will want to own it.If you like westerns - add this film to your collection.If you dislike westerns - skip this film.If you don't care one way or the other about westerns, but do enjoy great films - rent this one. It is certainly worth seeing, but don't run out and buy it. It may just collect dust on your shelf."
3,when the mighty western roamed free...,"As it has been only 10 years or so since the western was revived last, this film is not so much a throwback as it is merely out of fashion with the FX laden films of the past few years.Free grazing Cattlemen are attacked by the Town Rancher, as the west is being fenced in by the 1880s. The Cattlemen, complete with 'Kid' character, return for vengence against the Rancher and his corrupt Marshal.There is an excellent movie in here, too bad its makers did not see it. They overburden this simple story with repetitive scenes, repetitive lines, often delivered within 2 minutes of each other. Apparently this happens when the writer/director/actors fall in love with their characters and film, and think you do too.Just caught this on DVD, its worth a look. Seems to have made about $65 million, costing about $40 million."
2,Very Overrated,"I expected this movie with all it's praise to be a fantastic western. I leave feeling very dissapointed. I'm a very tough movie critic and usually find the birght spots in any movie to be enough to carry it over. However, this movie left me completely empty. It's cliche, overdramatic, poorly written, and incredibally empty. The saving points of the movie, are a clever idea of free grazers and a great gunfight, aside from that its a long 2 hours and 19 minutes. The story itself is cheesy, and nearly unbelievable. Costner is horrible, his character is a stoic individualist with no social skills, and his interaction with Benning is laughable. Duvall is solid in this role, however he is also very cliche and needs a real star with him to shine which he does not have.If your a western fan, this will most certainly not rank in your top 10."
2,Lacking Color,"I found open range very disappointing. The universal missing link is color in every aspect of the movie. The characters, the scenery, the dialogue, the sincerity, the acting, the props, the make shift town all lacked quality and color. I guess for Mr. Costner it was about breaking even and making a few bucks. Hoping that his fans would flock to the shows to view a hope of greatness like Dances with Wolves. I felt so empty after viewing this picture. I read some personal reviews and could not believe my eyes. If you have seen the movie Mission you would remember the imagery and sound, that did not find itself in Open Range. Open Range was just another tired old western so a few people could make some money and ride horses."
2,Open Range...,"I guess it might be interesting for die hard fans of Westerns, but for a normal person, no it is not worth a penny. I don't recommend it to very many people."
5,A new classic,"Kostner (actor and director), Duvall, and Annette Bening - a must see! As good as Broken Trail or Lonesome Dove (better?)."
5,Another over the top western,"In this movie Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall do it again making this an over the top well made western. Cinematography is excellent with plenty of action and personal feeling moments in the characters that are portrayed. Highly recommend this one for your video collection, you won't regret it."
4,Kevin Costner once again captures the magic of Westerns!,"A cloudless sky. Long green grass. Dirty boots. Worn hands. What is a film western? It's not those things, they make up a western, but what a western is is magic. Not the magic you find in a ""Harry Potter"" film, but real-life magic. The magic of going to a forgotten time, living with it's citizens, etc. ""Open Range"" captures that magic.Kevin Costner's sure directorial hands guide the amazing stars (Including Costner, himself) through a script filled with old west flair. The technical crew capture the beauty of the Old West in all it's glory and craft an intense, bloody, and memorable gunfight.""Open Range,"" despite it's minor flaws, is a modern Western classic. If you're a fan of the genre, you should definitely purchase it. It's a tale of love, war, and life in the good ol' west. Welcome back western genre! I missed ya!"
1,Don't waste your time,"This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Don't waste your time and especially don't waste the money. Long, dull and A-stereotypical. Tries way to hard to be the westerns of old and goes over the top in the cheese catagory. The acting was beyond dismal and Kevin Costner is more in love with himself then he is making a good quality movie. Major stinker!"
1,Don't even think about seeing this movie!!,"I rarely don't like a movie. This was one of the worst films I have ever been unfortunate enough to see. It's not ""slow"" or anything else that might justify how aweful this film is, it's just plain unbelievably bad. You'll cry it's so bad."
3,"Gus is dead, leave him be!","Robert Duvall has proven once and for all that he isn't actually acting... he's just dressing up and saying the words of different characters. I have to say that for me it has worn rather thin. I loved Lonesome Dove and loved Gus... but Gus died and it irritates me that Duvall repeatedly robs his grave. The screenplay is so plum full of hard-bitten, aw-shucks clichés it makes the movie almost unwatchable at times. Costner does a much better job directing than acting although it might be that his acting was hampered by the screenplay. Having said all of this I will also hasten to say that the realism of the sets, costumes and particularly the realism of the climactic shootout are all excellent. The scenery of course is great."
3,THE REVIEWS LIE.,"Its your average Old West yarn that shows its seams plainly. Its a blend of HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, UNFORGIVEN, GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL, and ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.Annette Bening is no chicky doodle and shows her miles from 10 feet away.It was about half boring and half interesting."
2,Who writes this stuff?,"Great scenery. Lousy dialog. Sometimes you laughed out loud. In most cases, I'm sure it's not what Kevin intended. Also, it could have been about 40 minutes shorter."
4,"Good, Not Great, Western","I like westerns so I liked this movie even though I would not rank it with the great westerns (The Unforgiven, Pale Rider, Lonesome Dove, etc.) Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall, playing free grazers cast in the mold of the strong, silent, basically decent old cowboy,are very good in their respective roles, as are the rest of the cast, esp. Annette Benning and Michael Jeter. The story is pretty much standard western--good old guys are done dirt by bad guys (including Michael Gambon with an on-again-off-again Irish accent) and they seek revenge, naturally involving a gunfight. However, the quality of the cast lifts this above the ordinary, the scenery is beautiful, and the story is satisfying. I recommend it."
5,The Wild West Rides Again,"I thought I was going to see a remake of Shane and in a way I suppose that's what Open Range is.....the classic Western theme. But the two lead actors put this movie on a different plane. Kevin Costner and especially Robert Duvall are just stupendous. They both 'feel' like the cowboy in your imagination. Their authenticity brings freshness to this much used theme. The final shootout is over the top Western greatness-alot different than Gunsmoke. When you add the beauty of the movie's Canadian landscape....well,it puts you right there with Boss and Charley. After seeing Open Range I feel that Duvall and Costner both have a shot for Oscars for their performances. For you and me...2 1/2 hours in the Wild West doin' the right thing."
4,Familiar actors acting great,"Good western to watch alone or in a group. I bought it to give away as a present, and it was well received."
5,open range,"received movie open range in a very prompted time and was in very good shape, made anice add to my movie collection"
2,The worst Costner Movie,"I like Kevin Costner films, even The Postman, and especially Waterworld, but Open Range is so boring, meaningless, and so cliched in its presentation that I would recommend any Clint Eastwood western film over this one."
1,Mother....The Paint Has Dried!,"I so wanted to like this film. I loved Kezza in Dances and A Perfect World and I wanted to love him in this, too. I even worked a flanker and got hold of the U.S. DVD so me, as a poor bloody Englander, could get to see it on my telly the same time as you Yanks do!Sadly, I have to say, I wish I hadn't bothered. Open Range makes the Open University (UK Gag) seem exciting. My God, Mick Gambon didn't appear until what seemed about 38 hours into the movie, and that was who I was hanging on for in the end.Kevin Costner fascinates a whole generation of balding men. He seemed to have less hair in Waterworld (The 'C' Movie) than he does now. What is his hair secret? That's what Open Range reduced me to - trying to work out how to reverse male pattern baldness!!I would have to say, only purchase this film if you have trouble sleeping at night. If you do, stick it on the DVD player about 10:30 at night and you should be sound asleep about two hours later. Very, very sad."
2,Like watching grass grow- predictable & boring!,"I won't spend a lot of time here because the film is not worth the time. It's disjointed, rambling, boring, predictable and illogical, however my wife liked it and I reaped the fringe benefits of sitting through this 'chick flick'. ;-)The cinematography was good but the story line was grazing somewhere off with the herd. It would have made a better 1/2 hour tv show (because it would have been about 1 1/2 hours shorter!). If you must watch it wait 'til it comes on cable."
3,Disappointing,"I am a Robert Duvall fan and expected more of this movie. It was just so-so, not worth the price."
1,1-star for the scenery only...,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory. Stilted dialogue. Scenes that faded out and made you feel like a commercial was coming on, unrealistic scenarios...just implausible from start to finish. Yes, you can leave and go get a snack and miss nothing, so that's handy I guess. I am a huge Robert Duvall fan and I never thought I'd see the day I would dislike a movie he's in and it makes me wonder at his good sense to agree to do it. Plus, he was playing Gus without the excellent dialogue of Lonesome Dove coming out of his mouth. Horrible. Whatever you do, don't spend money on this turkey. But, the mountains and the rangeland are beautiful, so there's that. Just mute it and fast forward through the ""action"". You won't miss a thing."
3,"Raw, Powerful","but...a little slow. From the very beginning the storm clouds are arising...which is usually a cinematic indication of bad things to come...but it takes two hours for that to happen. Don't get me wrong, I love Costner, but even his longer epics such as ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""JFK"" get to some action quicker.I saw this movie in the theater. There was a little kid sitting in the aisle entertaining himself the whole time. But once the big shoot-out began, the kid's full attention was on the screen. Sad, but true, that we are a violent species...we seek it, glorify it, and use it as a form of entertainment."
4,One of the best modern westerns,"Robert Duvall is the star here. Kevin Costner plays Kevin Costner. If you like Keven Costner playing himself, you'll think this is fine. But even if you're not a big Costner fan, the movie overcomes his lack of acting abilities quickly.The pacing is great except for a middle part at the doctor's house that drags somewhat.The fight and shooting scenes are believable and one wants to think the Old West was a lot like this movie's portrayal. Very fine movie."
3,"Slow, but ok","Over all I enjoyed this movie, but I did think it dragged on in places. It's over 2 hours in length and I think very few movies manage to pull that off well. Just a few too many scenes sitting around the campfire, preparing for the big gun fight, etc. some of the store was a little over the top too -- Robert Duval comes out pretty much unscathed.Nonetheless the plot itself was decent and there was some character development."
4,One of the few very good modern westerns,"This is a well done western. There will be too much dialogue, and romance for some that are looking for shoot-first westerns. But the gunfights are well done, and if you have a good surround sound system the shoot-outs near the end are realistically pounding. There are short times in the movie when heart-drama ""Lonesome Dove"" come to mind, but it is more of an action western, than a drama/saga. The Blu-ray of ""Open Range"" displays the beauty of the range land, and of the confrontational gunfights."
2,Interminable,Open Range was beautifully filmed and well acted. Unfortunately it dragged on endlessly. There was an incredibly long build up to the ultimate confrontation that was just written so badly it was excruciating. I was sorely disappointed.
3,Abrupt ending.,"The 2nd disc is about how it was made, the music, yadda, yadda, yadda. I was expecting an ending to the movie. It left me hanging. Trash disc No. 2!!i replayed disc ! to see if the ending slipped by me. Same result. I feel like the power went out."
3,Aaaaaaahhh....almost a classic,"I was actually a little skeptical of this movie given Costner's 'hit and miss' record in directing films. Despite my skepticism I purchased the movie in hopes he would come through with a decent one. In the end I was pleasantly surprised and almost enjoyed the entire show. Even though I enjoyed it I still can't get over how Costner has an unbelievable need to throw a 'love story' into every movie..no matter how awkward it may be. I was cringing the last hour of the film knowing what was coming in the end.....only because he is so predictable.In my eyes this movie had the potential of being a classic had Costner not tainted it with his forced attempt at a happy ending. Every western movie ends with the hero riding off into the sunset to roam the Wild West, right???"
4,The Best Western I've Ever Seen,"Now I usually enjoy western films, but not this much. This is just a really, really great movie. It's mixed just right so you like the characters and laugh, yet also feel for what they're going through and realize that the pioneer days were very hard and brutal times.Also, the end gunfight sequence is by far the best I've ever seen period. The realism and intensity of it are not to be matched.Incredible movie."
2,"Slow, Slower and Slowest!","I wanted so much to like Open Range! Perhaps that's why my disappontment was even greater! I loved DANCES; I loved LONESOME DOVE. I did not like OPEN RANGE. ""Slow"" just doesn't come close to describing how slow this movie is. I started wishing they would get onto the gun battle, just so the action would pick up. The ""extras"" on the dvd are better than the movie. OPEN RANGE is great on scenery; but Boss and Charley spent way too much time giving each other meaningful looks instead of getting to the business at hand...defending the rights of ""open rangers."""
5,Real-Cowboy-Movie . buy-it.,"My daughter is fifteen and she liked the movie,that was a shock to me.This movie has a Bad-Guys Get-It in the end and a really cool love story western style and throw some integrity in too!"
4,chemistry abounds,"nice cast selection here. the three principals, bening, duval, and costner all feed off one another well. nice chem between costner and bening. major personality differences between all that are highlighted nicely. guys pour yourself a brew and enjoy the shootout for all shootouts."
3,Not a bad movie but nothing special either.,"Robert Duvall and Annette Bening are good actors but even they couldn't bring this film above average. The story is very obvious from the beginning and offers no surprises at all. This is highlighted by the leaden acting of Kevin Costner who seems unable to generate any real emotion on film. In some roles that can work but this isn't one of them.I did really like Bening's character, though. No tough-as-nails or helpless female image as so often appears in films, she portrays a believable, realistic woman. Opposite Duvall's strong yet vunerable character there are some sparks, indicating who should have been the leading man!No, I don't dislike Costner. I've just rarely seen him portray a character of any depth. I don't know if that's due to bad choices in roles or if he's just limited in his acting range. Either way, it didn't work in this film.Open Range isn't a bad movie but I'd hardly recommend it unless you are a real fan of any of the actors involved."
5,ONE OF THE ALL TIME GREAT COWBOY MOVIES,"THE COMBINATION OF ROBERT DUVALL, KEVIN COSTNER AND ANNETTE BENING IN A TOP CLASS COWBOY FLICK. GREAT STORY WITH A CLEAR GOOD GUYS WIN ENDING."
5,Awesome,i really don't like westerns that often but when i come across a good one i'll let people know about it and this is one of them. Open Ranger is well directed and the actors are awesome espicaly robert duvall. i love this movie if you have not seen it yet then you should. peace.
3,Beautiful cinematography........slow dialogue.,"I really enjoyed the gorgeous setting on the range. The film was artistically shot in Alberta, Canada. I am sure it will win an Oscar for cinematography.The dialogue was rather slow and stilted and that left me scratching my head wondering why it was styled in that manner. Even so, Robert Duvall delivered his lines like a real 'ol cowboy.Bravo for the casting director casting Annette Bening as the ""girl"". She has aged beautifully and was perfect for the ragged wrangler.Waiting through the slow first half to get to the shoot out is well worth it. Hang in there and enjoy the good old western movie of yester-year even though it isn't in black and white but rather in beautiful Technicolor."
3,Should have been a 5 star,"If you have the patience, this is well worth watching. It has a great story, but not as good as the book. It has a great cast but Annette Bening was too old as Sue. Also, please use more of Kim Coates when you have such a talent as the as heavy. The main problem is that the script was a too flabby. Tighten it up and this would be a classic."
5,Great flick,"Jeff Shannon must have missed Dragonfly, but whatever (that too was a very entertaining flick). Anyway, Open Range is a slow paced Western, but excellent none the less. The only part of this film that needed to be reworked when being made was the ending. Very strange. Other than that, Costner is once again, at his best. Speaking of Kevin, anyone who thinks this guy is a bad actor can go jump off a cliff. Kevin Costner is a great actor and makes excellent films (ok, so Waterworld and The Postman weren't all that great... like Tom Hanks has never made a dud!). Go Costner. And go buy this DVD when it comes out."
5,Open Range,The best (and longest) shootout sequence ever for the guys and there is a love story woven in for the girls. I bought this copy as a gift for a friend who enjoys westerns. I enjoy watching it 2 or 3 times a year. Great western.
4,Great Movie,"This movie, as so many of Kevin Costner's, does not get the recognition it deserves. The actors are wonderful - the scenery fantastic - great one to have if you like both Kevin Costner, Robert Duvall and westerns"
1,Boring boring boring,Sorry but that movie was boring from the very beginning to the end. There is no action. Only blah blah blah. And the scenario is too classic.
1,Too Horrible for Words,"Words cannot describe how bad this movie is. Harlequin romance novels have better dialogue, plot, and character development. The only way to watch this movie is on ""MUTE"". The scenery is beautiful. The costumes look great."
1,SACRILEGE,"I've seen this movie on and off in bits and long pieces on the TV. I liked it so purchased a copy for myself. Settled down one night I went on this western adventure with the cowboys.Well what I got instead was an earfull and eyefull of blasphemy. 42:40 minutes into this movie a dialogue between Duvall and Costner crosses a irreverent line. Duvall is upset about the killing of his cowboy friend 'Mose"". In his anger he refers to our Lord as a ""Son of a b----"". At 43:34 Kostner ""agrees with"" Duvall digging deeper this anti-Christian conversation.Into the trash bin with the whole lot of them I say. There are many ways to express your deep frustration. But to color it with shades of blasphemy shall not be tolerated in our Christian community.Isabella adds: If I could give this zero stars I would. Shame on you guys!"
1,Wasted my money....,A plot as old as the movie industry itself. I've seen a lot of 'B movie' westerns that were better than this. The two 'good guys' cursing God was the last straw for a movie that I was already regreting having bought.
2,Too Long,"Costner does better with westerns than most but he takes himself way too seriously. He goes on and on and on... The first hour is a good set up for the next hour and a half or so...Duvall is great, almost as if he wrote his own dialogue. It is not that ""Open Range"" is not a good movie. It is just not that good. The pace is slow, which i think is deliberate to set the tone and it works, again for about the first hour. But even when the story gets going, it does not have enough power. The violence is subdued, as is all of the acting, almost as if Costner the director did not want Costner the actor to look too enthuiastic. Because all of the actors do not seem to be as interested as they want the viewer to be involved with their lives. There are moments that are endearing, but not nearly enough to make you want to sit through the length of the movie. With a rewrite of a few scenes and a deletion of a scene or two and the movie would have been as good as any directed by and starring K C."
3,Wanted more,"I love Costner and Duvall, but there was too much open range and not enough story about what was going on. There was a great story to tell and great actors to tell it, but it just didn't come through. It wasn't a bad movie, but it left me wishing for more."
2,Some character development + Acting not engaging + Some uninteresting shooting at the end = Boring.,"There was some character development but the acting was not engaging. Consequently, the love story did not touch me at all. There was some shooting at the end but it's not interesting at all. In short, it's boring."
1,why bother buying it?,"This is one badly written book. I cannot believe I spent USD20 , and I cannot believe other people gave it 4 stars or above.. Buy it used, or better yet do not waste your time. I barely finished a couple of stories. The book was characterized by Sloppy writing, no imagination and is repetitive and boring. Trust me, I only review something that impressed me deeply be it positive or negative , and this one was the later."
5,Amazing!,Based on the reviews I purchased 3 of the lettuce keepers for different kinds of leafy greens. I was a bit skeptical of the reviews that stated produce lasted 8 days but figured the product had to be better than the produce bags.We added leafy greens that had already been in the refrigerator for 5 days and were starting to wilt. They perked right up and have lasted another week and are still fresh and crispy!This produce does exactly what it says it does. Easy to recommend!
5,Excelent,I bought one about two months ago to keep the lettuce and it works perfectly for other vegetables as well so i bought another one for my regular veggies and two for my mom. I highly recommenced it.
2,It doesn't seem to work at all,I was very hopeful when purchasing the lettuce keeper because we are always throwing out bad lettuce. Unfortunately this didn't lengthen the shelf life of our lettuce at all. We buy the organic baby spring mix and it goes spoils at the same rate as when we leave it in the original packaging. Maybe this item works with whole heads of lettuce or maybe the veggie drawer in our fridge is amazing.......
5,Best Lettuce Keeper,"Have used this continuously since purchase. Especially good for firming up and preventing wilting of every type of lettuce we have used. Usually firms up very wilted store bought in 24 hours. Might be a bit tight fit for large head lettuce, but the Romaine bunches fit great."
3,Not for me but my husband uses it,"I don't find this works very well for me, but my husband keeps his lettuce in there and uses it daily. I find that freezer bags, which I can reuse, work better for me. It's a fine idea, just my greens didn't really stay as long as I'd hoped."
5,Awesome!,"I bought this for the obvious reason of keeping my lettuce and spinach fresh for salads. I have been trying to incorporate more greens in my diet but those items are expensive and turn brown and wilt in less than 2 days in the fridge. All I can say is that this item works. Since I received it about a month ago, it has been filled with greens and I have not once had to throw anything away. Easy to use and large enough to store a whole head of lettuce or bag of spinach."
2,Lettuce Keepr,This does not do what it claimed. I followed the directions and the lettuce turned brown before the week was up.
3,Mediocre,"You don't NEED this to keep your vegetables fresh longer. I don't know if it was only my case, but the lettuce i put into the keeper browned before the lettuce in the bag that i bought it in. Maybe you'll have better luck."
3,Lettuce Keeper,"I used this keeper constantly because I rip up romaine lettuce heads for my guinea pigs to eat. Although I don't know if my guinea pigs mind, I was certainly not pleased by the fact that the lettuce spines quickly turned pink and gross in just 2 days of having the lettuce in this keeper. I don't like this keeper very much."
2,Ehhhh...I'm still not sure about...,"I have had this product for seven months now, and I am still not sure on whether or not I like it... My old Tupperware lettuce saver that was half the size of this one was fabulous but I unfortunately lost it, so in turn I bought this. It does not save my lettuce as long as I would like it to. The container suggests that you turn the tab so that the holes are ""open"" NO, I would not suggest that. I have found if you place a little water underneath and close the tab so the holes are covered your lettuce will last a lot longer than if you do it the recommended way."
3,Gread idea but the lid is cracking after 3 weeks,I just don't know if this thing is going to hold up because after only 3 weeks of normal use (no drops) the plastic lid is cracking. Otherwise it seems to be doing its job. I love that it catches the condensation at the bottom.
1,Disappointed,The lettuce turns brown within a couple of days! It is a nice size for fitting in the refrigerator.
1,Top Lid Won't Stay On,I thought this would be the perfect thing for keeping my lettuce from going bad week after week. From the very first time I bought this container the top lid would not stay closed. The lip of the lid is too narrow and does not fit tight; it came off all the time. I don't know if this was caused by the container getting wrapped from shipping but it does not fit good at all. I would love this container if it had a wider lip to cover the product better. It's going to Good Will.
2,Good containers but I saw no improvement in storage length,"I use a salad spinner to wash and dry everything but there was really no improvement in storage length. Spinach/mixed greens only lasted about a week which is the same as if I left it in the plastic container/bag. I also bought the fruit and veggie keeper from the same company but the result was the same. I had moldy cucumbers within the first week, which is actually worse than if I just stored them in the crisper.I'm still giving 2 stars because they are convenient containers for washed veggies. Don't get your hopes up thinking that anything will last 2 weeks though."
2,Can't figure this out?,"I bought this specifically to keep lettuce. I follow the directions and kept the lettuce and the next day it was wilted and turning brown. I made some adjustments to see if maybe I was doing it wrong since I saw great reviews from others, and still not great. I keep my lettuce in a big ziplock and that seems way better than this. I have not tried it for any other vegatable so maybe it works better on other food stuffs."
3,I liked it,"The salad keeper works well, maybe my expectations were too high, I really thought it would keep the salad very fresh for much longer than it did. The iceberg lettuce turned rusty after not too long and I had hoped it would have stayed nice and fresh and green for a lot longer."
4,It Works,I purchased this to prolong the shelf life of leafy vegetables and it does work. The size is a bit of a problem to consider.
3,"Okay, but not great","I bought this lettuce keeper after throwing away heads of lettuce after 2-3 days. The reviews on Amazon touted this as keeping lettuce fresh for weeks. I have not found this to always be the case. I've been using it now for 3 months and I buy new lettuce every week. It's helped me keep my lettuce for a full week, but after 7 days, it's quite brown and that dark green ""mush"" occurs around the edges of the lettuce. It has extended my lettuce for a few extra days, but not weeks. And this has happened to different types of lettuce - romaine, bagged lettuce, green leaf lettuce, etc. It's also rather large. If you plan on putting it in your refrigerator's produce bins, it'll probably take up the entire bin. It's a good investment, but I wouldn't say it's a miracle product that keeps vegetables fresh for a long time."
3,"Okay, but warps in dishwasher",Perfect other than plastic warping. Make sure to put water in tray when recommended and it will certainly make a difference in life of produce.
5,The Kale Keeper,"Kale Smoothie Success: bring home kale, wash all of it, store in the Kale Keeper. No excuses, fresh, fluffy kale every morning. I love that this box clears up the produce drawer but keeps the kale in view. I can't believe some silly plastic thing works so well!Highly recommended."
4,lettuce keeper,I find that this product does help my lettuce stay better longer. I mainly use it for green leaf lettuce and the container is a great size for that! I bought one for my daughter also and she loves it.
5,"Works well, but it's big","Can't complain about how it keeps the lettuce fresher; it does do that well. The only drawback is that it's very large so it takes up a lot of room in the refrigerator. It can't really go in the crisper drawer, so it must sit on one of the shelves. All things considered, that's a very minor issue, however, so doesn't take away from the functionality of the keeper itself."
4,Does what it says it will do,I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. I still have cilantro two weeks old in the refrig and it is still good. I have gifted 3 of these out. A great way to eat fresh and healthy and save money.
5,Love it!,"I love this product! I mainly keep baby spinach in it and it keeps it fresh for around 1-2 weeks, where as I find it would go bad within a couple of days if it was kept in the bag."
5,Keeps produce crisp,"This product does exactly what it is advertised to do. I get my salad/smoothie greens, wash, shake excess water out, and store. More than a week later the greens are still crisp and tasty. I liked the first one so well I bought a second one. This gives me room to store all my greens from a farmer's market trip. Each would hold approximately two medium sized heads of lettuce, well or more than a pound of greens. After trying ""green veggie bags"" and various other storage methods for leafy greens this one is the one I'm very happy with and recommend."
3,"Good, but needs TLC","I bought this item ad well as the smaller bowl for fruits and berries. They both work pretty well. However, life other people here, I did put the pieces in the dishwasher on the top shelf and the lid did shrink and will barely close now. I only did it once and have hand washed it since. Still, it will barely close now.Bottom line: If you buy this bowl, I'd suggest you wash it by hand only."
4,"a little bulky in the fridge, but it does its job","I've had this for probably five or six years, and I can't complain about it. It would be great if it fit in the refrigerator a little better; it can't go into any crisper drawer I've ever seen. They probably should've made it rectangular (but maybe they figured people would put whole heads of lettuce or cabbage in it). Other than that, I like it a lot. I keep only clean, dry greens inside. I leave the little vents on the side uncovered and the top and bottom lids fully on, but you can remove the bottom lid and/or turn the little black dial to adjust the ventilation. I like the little removable divider you can use in the middle to break up the compartment, and the lettuce keeper is easy to wash. Overall, this thing is great--just make sure your veggies or fruits are pretty dry when you store them."
5,Keeps Greens Fresh,"This lettuce keeper is definitely amazing. Spinach that used to stay good in our crisper for 4-5 days now stays crisp and fresh in the keeper for twice that long. We love it, have given it as a gift, and would definitely recommend it."
4,Works like it should!,"I'm really happy with this purchase. I find that it keeps my vegetables fresh much longer than other methods I've tried. Here's a helpful tip: although it says that it's dishwasher safe I noticed that the top lid shrunk a little after running it through the dishwasher and now it's a little difficult to put on. Still, that wasn't a big enough problem for me to regret buying this. I use it constantly and I think it's paid for itself with all the veggies that don't spoil before I eat them."
2,very disapointed,"I was very excited to have this at first. After the first week or so the lid has become unstable and warped, it will not stay on tight and come's off in the fridge (it has hardly been through the dishwasher)."
3,Did not see the difference,This unit was too big for my refrigerator. I also did not notice my vegetables lasting longer. This product was not a good fit for me but maybe it would work for someone with a more spacious area.
3,gave lettuce longer life,"I've used this product for a week, and I'm happy to say it has kept my lettuce fresh longer than usual. I haven't had this product long enough to comment on the issue of the lid cracking. For now, I can say it was a good investment."
2,It did not work for me,"I tried storing some rinsed and dried lettuce in this lettuce keeper and some in a plastic bag and there was no difference whatsoever in how long they lasted. but the lettuce keeper took up a lot more room in the refrigerator. I don't see any need for it although it's nice looking and the top stayed on fine. I bought it like new at the thrift shop so I guess the first owner felt the same way, and I donated it back."
2,"Oh, well.",Returned this item. Didn't keep spinach fresh as long as I thought it should. A loft of commotion for what you get from the product.
2,Great idea but only lasts maybe 5 days in Fridge.,"Love the concept of keeping Spinach or lettuce fresh and crisp vs. soggy and wet. I bought this item with the sole purpose to eat more greens (spinach salad) for lunch or dinner along with grilled chicken, onions, cheese and dressing. However, my mother and sister buy only what they need at the Copps grocery store- self serve salad bar. According to them, it stays just as fresh in the plastic containers and is more cost efficient, and they get to choose how much they are taking so food does not go to waste. After using it for 1 week, I washed the container and has been sitting on my breakfast bar since. Recently, I bought spinach and thought I'd give it one more shot. I may possibly give it to my mom for her birthday instead of returning it. Hope this review helps you as I know it's hard to read all these reviews when it's just best to see for yourself! Everyone has their own preferences and what they'll end up using it for. Good luck!"
5,One of the best things I ever purchased,"Works great & has the ""storage settngs"" for the different fruits & veggies printed right on the side of the container, as well as in the instruction booklet. Also has a divider so you can store 2 different items that have the same storage settngs."
4,So far pretty impressed,"I bought 2 of these based on the reviews I saw, and while I was apprehensive, so far I'm pretty impressed. My only complaint is that they are a bit bigger than I expected, but I just moved a shelf up in my fridge and they stack nicely. I think I might try one for fruit, but to be honest, fruit doesn't last very long in this house because we eat it right away. I haven't tried anything like lettuce, but I have done some green and snapbeans and carrots and celery, and they are all pretty fresh. Right now I have okra sitting in one, and it's pretty happy in there. I think the thing I like most about it is the divider, which allows me to put more than one type of veggie in each container."
3,Great cocept and product but arrived with a broken top lid,"I love these containers. Since I live alone, I like to keep sandwich and salad materials handy but kept having to throw out rotten vegetables. This salad keeper significantly extended product life. Unfortunately my last one arrived with a broken lid, making it ineffective at controlling humidity. Very disappointing. I am now afraid to buy more!"
5,Awesome!,This product works great for storing many different vegetables. There are instructions on the side on how to store each vegetable. It's not very big so it stores easily. Very easy to clean! I would like a 2nd one that is bigger and somehow folds in on itself.
4,Smaller than you think.........,"Easy breezy ordering and service with good pricing but it doesn't hold as much as I thought it would. Nice instructions on the side as to whether you should leave the vent open for what type of veggies you're storing. All in all, I'm happy with the lettuce keeper."
5,"Wow, works better then I expected.",I've only keep carrots and celery in it. It's kept the celery crunchy for at over a week! I am truely amazed. It's larger then I expected but thats great becuase I can just put two whole things of celelry and a dozen carrots and be set. It's a must for juicers!
2,Not worth the money,I have been trying to find a salad crisper that actually works. I bought this one and tried it a couple of times without any satisfaction. It kept my romain lettuce dry but not crisp. I was originally using a large container that I purchased from the dollar store and will be going back to using that. It keeps it dry and crisp for a very long time and it only cost $1.oo. Save your money and don't waste your time buying this item.
2,"soggy, brown salad",I bought this with high hopes. I had a lettuce keeper that kept my salad crisp and fresh for a week. I bought this product and have been terribly dissappointed. I will buy a bag of salad and store it. Within a day or two the lettuce is brown and wilted. Unhappily I need to purchase a different one.
2,Lid broke in a week,"This might be a great product, but the lid tore within a week of my first use and barely stays on now. Plus, I'm pretty sure that defeats the whole purpose of keeping it sealed and from freezing."
1,Terrible,I bought this product. I hate it. My lettuce spoils faster then in the tupperware lettuce keeper I had to replace.I am not looking for something to replace this thing. I do not recommend it. Too bad I can't return it.
3,Didn't work for me as well as I expected,"I purchased this product, as I was sick and tired of throwing out lettuce after just a few days. While most people seem to have good luck with it, I'm not one of them. Yes, it prolongs the life of lettuce, but by only a day or 2 at most. I followed the instructions that came with the unit, but still can't get it to keep my lettuce fresh for more than a few days."
2,Disappointing,I bought this because of all the positive reviews but after using it I must say my lettuce lasted no longer then it did when I stored it in a plastic bag. The directions say to pour a small amount of water in the bottom and open the vent for keeping lettuce fresh. This only seems to make the lettuce turn brown even faster. The only good thing about this container is I can place freshly washed lettuce in the container and it will drain well. (Acts as a colander) That's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1.
1,"One idea, well covered in 58 pgs","Tom DeMarco looks at this one idea of ""slack"", basically how hard management makes an employee work, and its effect on productivity. He does so reasonably well but exhausts all his ideas by the 58th page. The remainder of this book is pure fluff, much like what you'd expect from a college student who has only 1,500 words for a 5,000 word essay. If you get this book, you need not flip past page 58.This book gets one star for the one (rather trivial) idea."
2,"Some good points, but boring","Before I get harsh, I will say that there are definately some good points and ideas that you will go away with from this book. However, the author could have said it in fewer words, and clearer. If you're reading this, I'm sure you've read all the cliche mangerial types of books. This, to Tom's credit, is different than your average manager book, with a different perspective on the surviving the coporate world... but its also a stretch. Much of the points in the book are not only subjective, and not backed with real-life anecdotes and testimonials (there are few, but they are far between), but the analogies are weak, and the diagrams and graphs are subjective and border-line bogus (not constructed with real points of correlated data; they are more like guess-sketches). If you looking for a fresh, quick, to the point book that will keep your attention and that you can't put down, then this is not that book."
2,Interesting idea but disappointing book,"I have read DeMarco's other works with great interest and enjoyment. I agree that ""Peopleware"" is one of the central books every technology professional should read and apply. However, Slack does not deliver the same level of effectivness and impact.The first part of the book is ok as it discusses the need for ""slack"" and the negative effects of having all resources fully optimized on productivity and sustainability. However the second part of the book looses steam rapidly and seems to be just criticism of current conditions rather than helping people make the justification and incorporate slack into their business practices.DeMarco is a giant in the software industry that many of the new technology professionals should get to know and recognize. I would strongly recommend that they meet DeMarco through his other works -- Peopleware in particular rather than this work."
2,Poorly written psychobabble,"This book was recommended to me by a colleague and I was excited going into it but within the first twenty minutes I found the book to be difficult to read for two reason.The first is that I don't feel like this is well written. The author seems to bounce around from page to page. It has a very jarring flow. Perhaps there was too much slack for him and his editor.The second is it's hard to digest and accept a book that just makes sweeping generalities. More so when there's very little proof or info to back it up.Overall, this feels like management psychobabble trying to promote ""the total paradigm shift to think outside the box"" as a quick fix. I think he brings up real problems that exist but he seems to present little information of how this fixes it."
5,Wake the World,"Wow. I'm embarassed to say that I thought I knew about the Beach Boys before I read ""The Nearest Faraway Place"". I was wrong. The depth of vision and analysis is staggering and told through the elegantly unobtrusive Tim White style I have come to expect from the book ""Catch a Fire"" and his columns in Billboard. It is designed to give you a full picture of the Southern California experience, dating back to the earliest generations of the Wilson family, but,if you want to skip the early chapters, you can go straight to the meat of the Beach Boys' history. Unbelievable unedited transcripts of the dialogue during recording sessions and insightful deconstruction of the cross-pollinization of inspiration happening in the Sixties. Which Beach Boys' song inspired which Beatle song, with help from which Byrd song, etc.; and all culled with interviews from the actual players and composers. Great stuff!"
5,Took Me Far,"A fellow commuter was reading this book and his recommendation was appreciated. The story was a genial entry into summer. It has a musical biography and a regional almanac joined as one. Now I seem to hear the Beach Boys music everywhere, or at any rate I notice it more. This would certainly be an ideal companion at the beach itself."
1,"No ""good vibrations"" here","Tying the Beach Boys into their Southern California milieu is an exciting idea; this book, however, fails to deliver. The writing is convoluted, the conclusions superficial and cliched, and the interviews with poor Brian Wilson much less than enlightening; and the narrative sags under the weight of Beach Boys trivia that crowds out what should be a truly compelling narrative."
2,"Inconsistant Book, Not Quite Fun Fun Fun","Vacillates between a geneology book and a book about Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. Does not capture the story of the Beach Boys as well as other publications. Dwells overlong into family histories or upon elements of the Southern California lifestyle. In fact, seems to gloss over the Beach Boys' story making it seem mundane."
2,Ambitious but uneven,"If you're interested in the early 20th-century westward migration, and in the early 60's surf and car culture, the first half of this book will be useful to you. As a history of the band, however, it's spotty at best, especially post-1970: an enthusiastic track-by-track review of 1970's ""Sunflower"" album is followed, not by discussion of the ""Carl & The Passions"" and ""Holland"" albums (which it doesn't even mention) but a capsule history of the discovery of polyurethane skateboard wheels and the revival of that sport. If you really want to know what was on every page of a newspaper from Hutchison, Kansas, circa 1910, then you'll probably like this book.White does seem to love the band, at least. Seek out his ""How Deep Is The Ocean?"" for a more satisfying read."
2,confusing info. on the beach boys,"i am a realy big fan of the beach boys but did not find this book to ""flowing"" or exciting. It does have some interesting informatin but was a book that I had trouble following."
1,Don't spend your money on this!,"This book was a complete waste of money - thankfully, I only paid $20 for a used copy.The book is essentially a glorified magazine with very high-level descriptions of the various RFID technologies followed by a series of brief, relatively simple, often redundant, case studies of RFID implementations.The $89 list price (for a 2+ year-old publication) is completely out of line.Do your initial research on the web first! Google is FREE!"
2,Poor Build Quality,"These shoes do not last very long and they tend to size differently between the left and right shoe. In other words, the size tolerances for the shoes are unusually large which tends to indicate a below average quality shoe."
1,Junk,This company knowingly sent out a damaged product with missing parts. Hard to contact this outfit and when you do your ignored. No integrity or shame.
3,"Holds quite a bit, suction cup included doesn't work for me","I bought this to replace a chrome shower caddy that had rusted with years of use. My bathroom is white, so I chose this one. While I like the size of this (it holds way more than my last one), it has some room for improvement. Bottles fall out of the large top opening VERY easily. I understand they put it there so you would have easy access to the items, but it's honestly more annoying than anything. The bottom part is even worse. Soap just falls through the bottom ""soap shelf""- don't even think about putting less than a full bar in there. It doesn't hold a razor well at all. It won't hang from it, and resting it on the bottom rack is precarious- it falls CONSTANTLY into my tub.That said, I like the clean white look and the bottle space. Even with the suction cup not working for me, it still stays up easily. Not bad, but I'd keep looking for another, better caddy if I had to do it over again."
3,Balance issue,"Feels durable. This will tilt to a side if you dont balance it. For example if you put 4 bottles of whatever up top and you take one out on the right side, it will tilt to the left. Also if you put a tall bottle on the top, it might block off the water from shower head."
3,"Good Protector, but don't bother putting in claim for PS3","I took a power hit and it took out my PS3, 9 days after warranty was up.(of course)So I contacted Panamax to put claim in, and they said I didn't have the right model which was PM8-EX. They denied me. So if your going to use this model for your entertainment center DON'T. Use the PM8-AV model for accepted claim warrenties."
3,Expensive but should be solid,"I have a long experience with Panamax products. They have always been well designed and deliver great performance.This one has a bit of an odd design in my opinion. It's not super easy to connect odd plugs (ie with transformers built in). It's also not well balanced and will not sit flat with things plugged in. However, this was the least expensive decent quality outlet/protector I could find."
3,Alicia's Review,"This book was very good. I could hardly put it down at times. It was a real page turner, and it always had something happening. This book was a romance with some mystery. The families in this book were a little hard to keep straight at times, and some parts of the book were a little too graphic. The book had a good plot, and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read a little romance and mystery."
3,All of Texas is a soap!,"Based on Joan Johnston's books one would assume that all of Texas is a soap opera. That said, if you liked the other books in this series and want some closure, it's worth reading. However, if you're looking for depth of characterization or innovative plotting or story lines, don't go here."
2,"Okay story, no romance, flat characters","I purchased this book thinking it was a romance novel - boy was I wrong! It's a long and undulating story about a woman who cannot stand up for herself and the rugged man who loves her (well, not outwardly until the end). It was a boring read, but I give it 2 stars since I actually finished it."
2,No backbone,"I find it difficult to finish a book when the female character is written as having no backbone. Summer Blackthorne is simply a weak, ineffectual person at best; which makes it highly believable that she's not of Blackthorne blood. The book makes ""opposites attract"" appropo - Bad Billy Coburn finally marries Summer Blackthorne, wimp of the west.I look forward to reading the Sisters of the Lone Star Series. I can only hope that these women of the old west portray stronger characters."
2,The Loner,I felt let down by this book it could have been so much better. It felt like they were trying to cram 30 people in a vw car. It was too many people and not enough focus on the main couple. I have read the whole series but can't say that I liked this too much. But the other ones were great.
5,The Loner,"I thought this was an excelent book as are the rest of the books in this series. I can't wait for the 4th book in this amazing series to be published. If you are intested in this book i'd recomend that you read ""The Cowboy and The Texan"" first they are just as good as this one. Joan Johnston never fails to write a book that totally captivates the reader."
3,Love the Series Like the Book,This is the second time this year when I have been less than satisfied by an installment in a series which I was very much engrossed in. In general I have loved Joan Johnston's Blackthorne/Creed series. The characters all have flaws and yet they are all deeply romantic. However this installment seemed to not develop the richness of the characters in the same way the previous books did. I also realize that it's difficult to keep up the intensity of a series that has so many installments; and I do look forward to the next book nonetheless. Readers of the series will enjoy this book to see what has happened to some of their favorite characters and especially to see Summer and Billy finally bring and end to the family feuds.
3,A decent rookie effort.,"Well, it has quite a bit to go. The graphical system is good, but not as good as what we are currently seeing from Electronic Arts. There are 26 NHL teams, but they all generally play the same. The gameplay is solid, but EA's NHL '94, the game for the same season, generally plays better. This is another googd Genesis hockey game, but a couple flaws and stronger competion keep it from being the best."
4,good value,"I was told that the delivery service would call and set up a time to deliver the table and chairs. When they called me at work, they were already at my house waiting for me! I work 30 minutes from my home, so this was an inconvenience for me and the delivery person. He was not told to call first. The furniture is very nice. We are happy with the quality.The color is darker than we expected."
1,"Could be great, if it ever gets here!","I own one of these in my vacation home, and it is a great product! I decided to buy one for our full-time house as well.However, I placed the order on Dec. 13, and received confirmation on Dec. 14. Amazon's expected delivery date was Dec. 21-27. As of Jan 5, it still hasn't arrived. I checked the FedEx site, and they tried to deliver it to someone with my same name in Pottstown, PA. Pottstown, PA? Seriously? It sounds like some dock workers were working too many hours during the holiday season!"
5,a book worth reading,"I read this book years ago, when I in early high school. I loved it and read it several times. So happy to have found it again, and look forward to rereading it."
3,PC Only!!!,"Based on the reviews above, I purchased this to shuttle files between my Motorola V710 and Mac running OS 10.3.7. Despite many attempts to clean up/re-format the disk, and removing .DS_STORE files before returning the disk to my phone, I have yet to get it to work between the Mac and my phone. As soon as I put a file on the disk from my Mac, even in the appropriate folder followed by removing .DS_STORE files, the disk stops working, and blocks access to other files stored on the phone. The best I can do is format it on the phone, and use it for extra storage. So, if you want something to pass files between your Mac and phone, keep looking!"
2,Transfer,I have a motorola e815 and i formatted the card and copied and pasted my music files. They appear in the removable disk on the pc after i've done so. There are preset folders on the card and im not sure if there is a specific one im supposed to place them in but the music files dont show up when i put the memory card back in the phone regardless. If anyone can help me please respond.
1,massive problems,"yeah well i got my transflash and all i want to do is put my previous pictures already taken onto it. So when i choose ""change storage device"" and choose the transflash, my screen goes back to the menu. Then once i try to go to pictures, it freezes. It also doesnt allow me to take pictures. If any of you have had this problem, [...] tell me whats up, thank you."
2,Hard for child to read,"This is an important story about a woman who did amazing things. One feature that stands out is her interaction with so many other influential characters of her day. (Though this may simply be a result of the way biographers obtain their material.)The reader must note that the book was originally written in 1944 and therefore the writing style is very challenging (and even dull, in spite of the amazing tale that is to be told) for an 8-year-old. The sentences are convoluted, the dialogue -- which is quite sparse to begin with -- is confusing, and many archaic words are used. My 8-year-old, who has torn through 700 pages of Harry Potter, was very excited to conquer this 188-page biography but got stuck very early on and it was like pulling teeth to get her beyond Chapter 4."
2,Informative but disappointing,"I got this book to read out loud to my children. They seem to enjoy it (after all, Blackwell's story is fascinating and inspiring!), but I have been disappointed. The characters are rather flat, there is a lot of repetition, and the author moralizes a great deal. I have ended up reading only excerpts from it as I can't stand to slog through the whole thing. Although the book has been informative on the barriers that Blackwell overcame and on her accomplishments, I wish there was more social, historical, and medical context."
4,Parts of it didn't even seem real!,"The first biography I ever read, about anybody. It didn't even seem real. we've come so far."
4,Just as good as You-Know-Who,"After my first ADC pediatric stethoscope was recently lost or stolen I needed a new scope fast. I loved the last one so decided to replace it with another ADC. Not before I peeked at the Littmanns though... $73-125?? Believe me, they are no better acoustically! Paying extra (2-4 times as much)just because they advertise on ""ER""? The only thing the other brand has going for it is a better color selection (but only on the peds model) and slighly more comfortable ear tips, although the Adsoft rubber tips aren't bad and I appreciate that it comes with extras. It arrived faster than I expected, too. All I ask is that if you need a good stethoscope buy your own ADC and leave mine alone!"
5,As good as the more expensive stethoscopes,"This is a very high quality pediatric stethoscope. I use this every day at work and can compare it to other stethoscopes I have owned, including the ""gold standard"" Littmann pediatric stethoscope. The Adscope stethoscope provides the same high quality acoustic properties as the Littmann stethoscope and is very close to the same level of product quality for less than half the price. Is a true bargain and is now my standard stethoscope."
5,ghosts of the abyss,the wimp baby paxton totally ruins this ecxellent doc.moans about everything then thinks hes in charge.you can see that none of the crew like him at all and wont even talk to him.but thats him a small time crap actor who thinks hes better than he is.anyway brilliant doc by cameron and dont care that he may be hard to work with as people in the abyss terminator 2 and avatar have said. this is why he is one of the best directors around he knows what people want as he wants the same thing.id advise anyone to see this who is fascinated by the titanic like myself.out of all the docs ive seen about this great ship this is the best as it goes deeper inside than anyone elasr has done.
5,Great Movie!,This movie was a great teaching tool! And I was able to enjoy watching it with friends and family who didnt' know that much about the titanic
3,Kursk Submarine Tragedy,"This is the best done documentary/dive to Titanic to date. It should be noted when this expedition was going on the Kursk Submarine tragedy occured. Because both Mir mini subs were hired out for this expedition the Russian Navy had no submersible to go to the sunken Kursk, had one Mir been available the men who survived the explosion and retreated to the rear compartment of Kursk could have been rescued. Moral of the story here is perhaps it is better to leave these sunken ships like Titanic alone and let them rest in peace. I did not see anything in this film that was worth risking the lives of the people going to Titanic nor those dead Kursk Submariners."
1,Ghosts of the Abyss,Unable to watch it. It is in the wrong format and not in english. Can not get anyone to acknowledge the mistake and exchange it for a blu ray in USA format.
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I WAS EXCITED WHEN IT FINALLY CAME OUT ON VIDEO .MY FRIEND BROUGHT IT OVER AND WE WATCHED IT. IT BORED THE SOCKS OFF ME .THE ONLY COOL PARTS WERE WHEN THEY FINALLY WENT DOWN TO SEE THE TITANIC . SHE'S STILL SO BEAUTIFUL AFTER ALL THESES YEARS . IT WAS MORE LIKE A DOCUMENTARY THEY NEED TO SHOW MORE OF THE TITANIC.IAM SO GLAD I DIDN'T BUT IT .
5,Excellent and informative.,Excellent and informative documentary. Underwater filming was beautiful. My daughter loved it.
4,Titanic Documentary,"I didn't get the chance to watch the documentary when it was in Imax theatres so I jumped on the chance to own it on DVD. I'm a big fan of the Titanic tragedy and this film satiated me for the most part. Beautiful views of the bow, boilers, private promenade, etc. I was let down by the focus on Bill Paxton and his reactions to what he was seeing. It was a nice element to show a regular guy's reactions to first seeing the Titanic but after that, I could have done without. For instance, a minute of footage was burned on Bill Paxton's need to urinate into a bottle. Seriously. So, for that reason I have to give less than perfect at: 4/5. If you have never seen footage of the ship and aren't a huge Titanic buff; 5/5."
4,My kid loves this,"An OK change from having to watch the movie Titanic all the time. Kept my young son interested for the most part, but then, he LOVES the Titanic. I thought it was a bit on the boring side, myself."
5,Immaculate,"It's been more than ten years since I got this one, and I still never tire of hearing it - again and again. This masterpiece is apt to invade the mind and spirit in a big way. Mainly owing to the varied origins and, hence, musical traditions of the musicians, one is tempted to tag it as ""world music"" or, perhaps worse, due to its lofty mood, as ""trance"". But fear not, while elements of these genres may make fleeting appearances, what has been produced here transcends perfunctory descriptions.The excellent skills of the artists involved is amplified by a flawless production that distills a singularity rarely found in any genre. The forces of the likes of Jaki Liebezeit, Zakir Hussain, Jah Wobble, Bachir Attar, Amina Claudine Myers, and Bill Laswell, to name but a few, conspired here mightily to create pieces that make lasting impressions, pure and fresh even after the 100th hearing.This is music that is rejoicing yet pensive and it's bound to get you by the throat."
1,"awful ""music""","Another example of self-indulgent, easy-listening, adult contemporary junk, along with Material's Hallucination Engine. Bought them through Amazon and traded them the same day I got them in the mail. Abismally dissapointed, 'nuff said . . ."
5,The Lion and the Lamb,This book gives an extremely perceptive view of the paradoxes within the Bible and the Christian faith. It helps to ground that faith in reality.
1,Poorly done,This movie is pointless and boring. Plot really goes nowhere and certainly not entertaining or funny. I was highly dissapointed based on the previous reviews.
1,Muddled and Confused,"This book is seriously flawed. I could not work out if the author was a mathemetician dabbling (very poorly) with philosophy, or a muddled philosopher bumbling his way around computer science. This is not a serious AI book, it is more a confused manifesto similar to those that pop up all to often on internet AI newsgroups by the various wackos that feel the need to vent their bizzare ideas to all the world.The author's philosophy is summed up in the last paragraph of his preface: ""In sum, the book intends to tell the reader that there is no other way to build ultra-human machine intelligence excepting by synthesizing the highest intellectural achievements of collective human minds in philosophy, science, and mathematics and then embodying such universal knowledge about reality, mind, language, and artifacts into machines""."
4,Worth the read,"Like most specialty magazines, this has rather variable editorial quality. I have to restrain myself from editing as I read.I expect many of the authors are semi-pro, at best, but that's just fine with me. I'd rather learn from an expert/veteran than hope for the best from a polished journalist who hasn't been there.Good stories, mostly, and always leaving me wanting more. I think that works out ...."
4,"Perfect for the mathematically challenged, thoroughly befuddled, algebra hating student!","Algebra Survival guide is colourful, fun guide with an answer to just about every student struggling through Algebra 1. I have used it lots of times, and it has always been able to help me. Thank you Survival Guide!!!!"
4,Missing nth root and Prime Factorization,"Great books for refreshing your Algebra. I was relying on this rather than my math book as I found this more entertaining and easy to visualize compared to my boring math book. Since I was away from math for awhile though and only had this as a reference, when I wanted to remember what prime factorization was, I was surprised not to find it in here. I had a complete brain fart but eventually remembered the process. However, I was annoyed it was not in the book. Also, it has no help on ""nth"" roots. So far so good though and I've had it for almost a month now."
5,Thank God for Algebra Survival Guide: a Conversational Guide,It has been over 20 years since I took my college algebra course. I pulled out my old college algebra book and it was just as confusing to me now as it was then. I purchased the Algebra Survival Guide: a Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled and the questions I had from studying my college algebra book were being answered as I studied the Algebra Survival Guide: a Conversational Guide for the Thoroughly Befuddled. This book is very informative and easy to understand and read. There are step by step instructions which I think is a blessing. It is as if Josh knew what was going through my mind as I studied my college algebra book and wrote the book for me. This book is so informative and well written that it makes learning algebra easy. Algebra is not the big bad wolf to me anymore. I am passing this book down to my 16-year-old and my 11-year-old. I wish I had had it for my 20-year-old when she took algebra in high school.
2,Its for pre-algebra,"Sorry, folks. I had high hopes that this would help me understand college level Algebra but more importantly, help me easily recall why things worked like it should. It can only cover up to quadratic and that is it. Will not explore any further topics like Rational Theorem or Function that are found in Algebra.It needs more work and more in depth and frankly it is best suited for high school pre-algebra type. Save your money.Oh by the way, I downloaded as Kindle format into my ipad. Some of the pages text boxes have white background but with very light gray lettering making very hard to read. Most of the pages are black background with white letterings. I am not sure why the publisher would do that with textboxes.I dont recommend this book at this time. Maybe someone can chime in with better recommendation for older guys who are returning to college."
5,Appeals to everyone!,"I purchased this book and the ASG Workbook as a supplement for my adult education students (basic literacy skills, displaced workers, GED prep) but it's become my primary resource. I knew it was a winner when one of the gangbangers in my class looked up from the section on integers and said, ""&%$#@! If I'd had this book in school, I'd have graduated!""It's all good; the conversational style, the memnonics, the drawings, the fact that it contains ALL the answers to the exercises, and the Q & A format. It appeals to all my students (who aren't in my classes because they did great in high school) and it really does make algebra fun. I just wish my program could afford to buy classroom sets of this book and that Mr. Rappaport would turn his attention to other areas of mathematics."
4,Pretty basic stuff!,"This book provides a pretty good review of basic algebraic concepts, although I wished it would have gone in a bit deeper by covering more topics. Comes with a handy little review sheet with basic formulas and concepts. Would recommend to anyone who is COMPLETELY new to the concept of algebra but for slightly more advanced students I would recommend something else."
2,Disappointed in this book,"As an adult, I was disappointed in the layout and text of the book. It may be suitable for kids, but is too cute for adults. I'd rather have the information without all the verbiage directed toward adolescents. Also, almost immediately I found mistakes in the workbook in the form of answers that directly contradicted the text. After going to a brick and mortar store to look at books on algebra, I ordered Algebra I for Dummies and the accompanying workbook from Amazon."
3,"OK if you need a workbook, but its no textbook","Its a good book if you need lots of practice problems to do, but if like me your going back to college and need to LEARN algebra for the first time its not for you."
2,Not Easy to Understand,"The book is in a question and answer format, and it is not easy to find the sections you want to go over."
4,algebra help,In trying to find ways to help my son with algebra i found this book thats easy to use to look up specific areas and problems when we struggle. It has some humor and is written for the lay person so that we can figure out the problem and move on.
5,Excellent,"Excellent. I was working on my MBA and needed a refresher. This was spot on. This could be used for Junior High and High School Kids. I plan on using this information when my children start taking Algebra. When I was a kid, my dad said ""Son I can't help you with you that new fangled math."" I swore I would not do that to my kids. This is an outstanding book to get up to speed quickly. I plan to finish this book and then do College Algebra!"
5,Fundamentally Sound,"This is a great book to start out with for beginning algebra. It's well thought out and carefully researched. This man knows how to teach a subject that frightens most 1st year algebra students into a full blow math phobia. Every example is pain stakenly explained. Care and compassion, is weaved into each problem and answer. Highly recommend."
2,Basically a Pre-Algebra Book,"This book is basically a pre-algebra book. For students who have already completed pre-algebra and are now taking algebra, they would find ""The Everything Guide to Algebra: A Step-by-Step Guide to the Basics of Algebra - in Plain English!"" far more useful. The Algebra Survival Guide wastes a lot of space that could be used better for instruction. It also provides problems on each page, but also includes the answers on the same page which makes it difficult to use as an exercise book. Further, it emphasizes number properties such as reflexive property, symmetric property, and transitive property, which are rarely taught but ignores more common number properties such as inverse properties. But as for basic algebra, the book is very lacking."
5,Math? Fun? Who knew?,"I love, love, love this book. I never thought it was possible for math to be fun, but this book manages it. I look forward to our math periods now and even my most challenged 7th graders can get the concepts the way they are laid out here. We will be through with this by the end of the year, so what next, Josh? Thank you for making it possible for a right-brained person have a blast teaching math."
4,This is the formula for my problems!,I have been shopping for a good tutorial algebra book for several weeks so that I could help my struggling teenagers. I probably would not have shopped this book because the cover gave me the impression of chaos. I feared that the pages would be full of text that would baffle us even more. I bought this book and workbook based on the customer's reviews...and am I happy I did so. I learned not to judge a book by its cover. The book layout is easy to read with one problem per page in step-by-step detail. This is exactly what I've been seeking. Too bad Rappaport does not have a book on Geometry...that's our next level.ps. The only reason I did not rate this book a 5 is because the contents covers ten fundamentals whereas other books cover a bit more. But the layout is worth the compromise.
1,embarrasing,"...really this is. whoever is a fan of dub. dont bother. the man who dubbed this was laughing at Mishka all the way. his method of turning tunes to dub is worse than a 10 year old. he merely echoes the vocals... in that- they only repeat the last word of sentences over and over and OVER... without actually 'echoing' the sound, such as in the works of coxone, tubby or pablo. and the DRUMS!!!terrible."
2,It's OK but there are better ways you can spend your money.,"I sometimes pay a professional baby massage therapist to work on my little one. I have tried to save money by doing it myself and have seen several DVDs. This one is OK but for the money, try Aimee Ketchum's. She not only is a good instructor, she seems like a loving mom and is certified as a physical therapist. She also has great exercises and doesn't expect you to spend an hour at a time for the benifits of baby massage on your baby."
4,Endurance Music,"This music requires strength. The musicians must have the stamina to maintain extended notes and rhythms that can last for hours in their native performances. Using simple drums, pipes, and strings, the Master Musicians of Jajouka are legendary for their trance-induction ceremonies of wild abandon. These tracks are but tiny samples of their wares; still, they are rich, complex, and other-worldly."
4,CD grows on you,"I initially bought this CD, although a reviewer on CMT.com said it wasn't a great album, but was a good time. Some of the songs sound off at first hearing, simply because of a different voice singing them. However, this album really grows on you. The producer used the same back-up band on all cuts but three, so there is a cohesiveness to the sound. I've been blasting it non-stop in the car since I received it. I definately recommend."
3,Coa$t 2 much,"these tips are ok but 12 for $25 & $30 after S&H; is a lil too much,if Ihad it to do over I would have got the 25 tips for $35 or kept lookingfor a Better deal other than that I cant complain."
3,do not understand this music,This music i do not understand. Three stars because it is good further. Only elegance is not enough for me.
2,To whom we should ask WHY ARE WE LIVING?,"This is a good book for looking to life in a happy way. But there is a major failure here, since 'Why are we living?' question should be asked to 'GOD' -Who created the all universe & all human beings- and we should look for the message from the GOD. Not we should just imagine & go into our way.The positive & happy look to life was written in a perfect way in Risale-i Nur Kulliyati, (including The Words 1-2, and The Flashes) by Said Nursi Bediuzzaman.Anyone like this Conversations with God-1-2-3, I advise Risale-i Nur Kulliyati (The Nur Collection) by Said Nursi Bediuzzaman to completely understand & learn 'WHY ARE WE LIVING on earth? and WHAT IS THE AIM & GREATEST HAPPINESS OF LIFE?."
5,Love the leotard.,My daughter loves this. It is probably the sturdiest piece of ballet clothing she has.
5,Love this book!!,"This is a great book. It has all the favorites from Dayton's, Marshall Fields, and Hudsons."
2,Not the recipes I remember from the 60s,I was hoping to see the recipe for the 7 layer cake they used to sell in the bakery. The only thing I remember out of the book was the chicken pot pie my mother used to love when we ate in the downtown Hudson coffee shop in Detroit.
2,"Warning, item not what is shown in the picture. I feel deceived.","I purchased this item, and left feedback, but pushed ""enter"" too soon. Here is my review of this item:The item states hip holster,yes. But the picture that goes with it clearly shows it being used as a tatical leg holster, with a mazazine pouch, leg straps, and a strap to attach it to a belt. All I received was a lone holster (not even with a mag pouch!), which I would not have spent this money for, if I had known. Seller offered to have me send it back for a refund, but I would have spent $5 for initial shipping, plus more to ship it back, and have nothing for it. Seller(who does seem very polite) admits now that the picture is not accurate and said it would be changed. I wish I could include the current picture here, in case they change it. It shows a leg sideview, with a gun in a holster, which has a mag pouch, with straps around the leg, and a strap going up to and attached to a brown belt.I feel deceived and disappointed."
3,This book was slow,Although I normally enjoy DIck Francis I found this particular book a little slow and hard to actually get into.Even that being said it was still a good read.
4,Great read,"I enjoyed this Dick Francis a lot. A great story, believable characters, interesting inter-personal dynamics, and very enjoyable. Probably one of my favourites."
4,Another good story from Dick Francis,I do like the way that all of Francis' tales centred around horse racing (steeplechase actually) but feature different professions and jobs. The research for each seems to be top stuff
4,Nerve,Have always enjoyed Dick Francis' books and this one is another winner. You don't have to love horses to enjoy his stories - his good people are people you would like to know and his bad guys are usually very bad. Always a fun read.
5,My First Francis Novel- First of Many,"Very impressive work. Finn was a wonderful character to follow through the story with; a great, honorable man. A highly engaging and interesting plot, with no time wasted. I aspire to read many more works by Francis, and recommend him to friends and family. 5 for 5 for mystery. Well done."
5,Great for teaching evolution,"I bought this movie hoping it would be good for my high school biology class. It couldn't have been more perfect. It was perfect to introduce evolution, talk about some of the questions the kids always ask about and even brought back in some previous concepts for review, such as genetics, cells, the history of life, classification, etc.Very well made and I'd recommend it. I'm going to make this a staple in my evolution unit."
3,Why?,"I believe in the theory of evolution and often times find myself defending it. I liked this program, but I have to dock off two of the five stars for one particular reason. I'll do it time and time again but when I watch a show about animals, I don't care to see fish being eaten, mice being dragged by the throat by a house cat, lions ripping into a zebra, a bird ripping a live worm, and so forth. Call me a PETA nut, I don't care. But I watch a show to learn. If I wanted to see blood and guts I would watch MMA or something like that.In that show Blue Planet they kept sprouting how beautiful the world was. I'm sorry but I don't find beauty in animals being ripped apart and left dying while a horde of predators rip its insides out.As far as this doco goes, it would have gotten five stars, but because of the fact that they almost go out of their way to show animals being eaten or birds drowning in water, I just can't say I enjoyed it."
5,Darwin's legacy,"An excellent overview of Charles Darwin and the science of evolution. The program is beautifully filmed and highly entertaining.There are several good DVD's on Darwin to be had, but this one is certainly a must for the information it contains."
4,Short and sweet,"Nice tape. Effective and short. Practiced regularly it will absolutely improve your tone and and build muscle. If you already have toned abs and stabilizers it will help you be accountable by ""just doing 10 minutes every day."""
4,Good workout,I really like that the video is divided into 3 10 minute sections so if you are running short with time you can just pick the area you most need to focus on.
1,NEVER RECEIVED PRODUCT,"I ordered the product over a month ago and NEVER received it. I contacted the seller who did not contact me back. Don't lose your money ordering from this seller. I only gave it one star because I had to, I'd give it none if I could."
4,Hooked!,"OK-I'll admit it. I'm hooked on Suzanne Brockmann's Seal Team 16 novels and I want all the team members to eventually get hooked up with some fabulous woman who is going to make them happy for the rest of his life, etc., etc. This book was no different from the others--lots of excitement, a World War II subplot, and a happily ever after at the end. Except for Sam Starrett & Alyssa Locke--the one couple you want to get together. Right up to the end, you know that everything is just going to work out for them, but then Brockman throws a big curve. Why can't these two just get together already? I know that I will read the next installment to the Seal Team 16 saga, but I was very disappointed at the end of Over the Edge. In fact, I was tempted to throw the book across the room!"
4,"Good Suspense, Silly Romance.","I loved the action around the storyline involving the hijacking of the airplane and the brave young girl who risked her own life to save other passengers on the plane by posing as the politician's daughter. I also was surprised that Brockmann gave this girl something of a pretty horrible fate which, in a way, I had to respect.The two main romances among the officers was awfully silly and transparent, but I'll give Brockmann points for some very sharp and funny dialog. The best romantic story was Helga's recollections of her brother and her best friend's sister during WWII, which I found very touching, and I also wished she didn't have Alheimer's.Some of the plots are silly and often bile inducing, but there are so many layers in this verbal cake that one can almost pick and choose their favorite stories and disregard the rest easily. A generally good, fast paced book with something for everyone, and for that reason it works."
2,Major disappointment,"What happened? I was very disappointed with Sam and Alyssa's romance. At least 75% of the anticipation for this book was to see how this rocky,funny and deep hearted relationship would end. Sam was honorable, rough and somewhat of a jerk, but he had a mind of his own. The end of his relationship with Aylssa was a cop-out, so 1950's and very much out of character. He and Aylssa deserved much better. It was not an enjoyable read. It seems as though Ms. Brockmann got tired of Sam and Aylssa's story line mid-way through the book and just ""kicked it to the curb""."
2,First book - Never Again,"This is the first Suzanne Brockmann book I've ever read. The story was interesting & the characters seemed real. That said, I didn't like the ending with Sam & Alyssa. I can see why she didn't write a story just about them, the ending [wasn't very good]. I don't normally write reviews, and never any bad ones, but I was so annoyed with the ending of this book I decided to vent a little of that here. I'm sorry I invested time & money in this book & I will definitely NOT be buying another of her books.I know a lot of people are fans of her's & I'm sorry if this review offends them. I just personnaly don't like to read books that drag you down emotionally. I suppose that says something about her writing skills, that her characters can effect me that way.I don't expect this review to influence anyone, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who likes a happy ending."
4,When will Sam and Alyssa get their own story?,"Yes, I enjoyed this book. It was fast-paced and thrilling and I really enjoyed the two lead characters. But...Ms. Brockmann cannot continue to make her secondary characters more interesting than her primary ones. I found myself skipping through the main parts to get back to Sam and Alyssa. When do they get to be the central characters in their own book? I cannot believe this is the way their story will end. Yet, if I understand correctly, the next novel is about Wildcard. Nonetheless, this is another great ride from SB. Even though the hero- Stan - is sometimes as dense as mud....Teri obviously forgave him, so I guess I can too."
3,disappointed,"I was so anxious for this book to be put on the shelves for sale. I read it primarily to find out what happened to Sam and Alyssa. Then the ending for them left me so diappointed that I wanted to cry. Surely, this isn't the end for Sam and Alyssa. I read some of the other reviews implying that another book is in the works for Sam and Alyssa. I sure hope so! I love Suzanne Brockmann's books."
2,Warning this book contains a rape scene,"I was enjoying this book right up until i read the rape scene. Like other people who gave a negative review i read romances for a guaranteed happy ending.i can handle the Sam and Alyssa ending because it was obvious that SB was building upto their story later.Nothing and i mean NOTHING kills my enjoyment of a book (whether it is a historical, contemporary, thriller, sci fi genre etc.) quicker than a rape scene, i don't care which character it happens to, it does not belong in my gooey romantic world! So now i find myself at midnight having to go through my book collection to find a nice gooey romanctic comedy to try and obliterate the nasties out of my head because i won't be able to sleep until it's gone. Thanks alot SB for turning what should have been a happy ending into a case of the nasties."
2,High School Dialog,I normally can't wait for a Suzanne Brockman book but the dialogin this book is so high school (maybe Jr Hi) I just could notread it... so sorry but this one is a bomb!!!...I couldn't evenfinish it it was so boring.
5,Incredible story and GREAT acting,"When you think about it, this is basically a two-member cast that is asked to hold your attention for nearly two hours. They do, and they owe some of it to John Huston, the director, but most of it to their own performances and to the grip of the story line. I've heard and read many stories describing how difficult this movie was to produce, given the climate and the director. It shows in the faces of the actors, but then they situation they find themselves in as part of the story is not an easy one. I'm glad I've not lived anyplace where people were trying to shoot me, and I am very greatful that I have never been faced with killing anyone else. I don't know if I would find the faith to do what the characters do in this story, but I can only hope so."
5,Parents took me to this at the Drive In.,I loved this film. My Mom took us kids to it twice with my Dad of course. I think that's their idea of a date night out was the drive in with us kids bathed and in our flannel PJ's. Off to the movies we'd go. This one stuck out in my 7 year old mind as worthy to remember. Been looking for a copy for ever. And so glad to find it here on Amazon today. Thanks...and for older movie buffs this is a delightful one. Years later as a teen I saw a Mitchum movie that creeped me out and took a long time for me to be ok with him. Growing up helps to realize you can separate the actor from the roles he plays.
5,Old movie fan,"I love this movie and two of my favorite actors! Robert Mitchum fans should really love this one, as you get a little sweet and alot of tough! Great movie but not played alot, so really happy to have my own now! Arrived in perfect condition."
4,heaven knows Mr allison,the story of A capture american soldier during world war 2 who escapes and gets to an island where here finds A nun they survive even when the enemy takes the island and have to go into hiddden.
5,Heaven know's this is a great movie!,"Haven't seen this movie for years and was so happy to rediscover it. When I was young (40 years ago), I used to seek out WWII movies. While this movie takes place in a WWII setting, it's much more about the relationship between 2 superbly developed characters. Can't wait to watch it with others!"
3,Excellent south pacific adventure focusing on personalities.,"There's something great about World War II movies made in the 50s. Hollywood grew out of the gratuitous and overly sweet romance themes, and put more effort into production and plot. ""Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison"" is a perfect example. Deborah Kerr(the perfect nun) and Robert Mitchum(the classic marine) are marooned on a south pacific island during WW II. Great similarities develop between the nun's devotion to the church, and the soldier's devotion to the marines. Eventually, the marine becomes quite fond of his island companion, but she remains true to the church. You get the feeling, though, that she's almost ready to give it up for him at one point in the movie. If you like 'marooned on the island' kind of movies, also check out ""Hell in the Pacific"" with Lee Marvin, and ""African Queen"". John Huston produced both ""Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison"" and ""African Queen""."
5,One of the greats!,"Although, I do not own this movie (yet) I have seen It A dozen times. I love it! My father,being A Marine during W.W.2,the movie held special meaning for me. Here are two people with such totally different beliefs and lifestyles, stranded on an island togther. Alone! I mean how much more ironic can you get! A Marine and A nun! You realize as you watch the movie, that they are not as different as you would think. They are both proud of what they believe in and what they stand for. The tensions they experience,as a man and woman together and later the respect for one another are beautiful!"
3,Weak album,"Pretty weak CD, nothing really stands out. Definitely not worth the money.The only track that stands out for me is Sol-7 - When Love Comes."
5,AN EXCELLENT RESOURCE!,"WHAT AN AMAZING BOOK! THIS BOOK COVERS ALL THE IMPORTANT AND WELL KNOWN ROYAL HOUSES THAT BESTOW HONOURS/TITLES ON PRIVLEDGED MEN AND WOMEN WHO, THROUGH SERVICE TO THEIR COUNTRIES, DESERVE TO BE RECOGNIZED. THE PAGES ARE FILLED WITH INFORMATIVE INFORMATION COVERING EACH ORDER/AWARD, WITH VIBRANT COLOR PICTURES, AND INDEPTH COVERAGE OF WHAT EACH AWARD IS COMPOSED OF, THE HISTORY BEHIND IT, IT'S FOUNDERS, AND THE YEAR EACH WAS INSTITUTED. IF YOU ARE AN ADMIRER OF ORDERS AND JEWELRY, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. WHILE SOME ORDERS ARE NO LONGER USED, MOST ARE STILL GIVEN AS HONOURS TODAY. IF YOU ARE A WATCHER OF THE BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY, THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR LIBRARY AS IT DESCRIBES MANY OF THE MEDALS/ORDERS WORN BY THE ROYALS OF THIS HOUSE TODAY, INCLUDING THE ROYAL FAMILY ORDERS. INDEED, A GREAT REFERENCE BOOK. A++DAVID W. LEWIS,OLD TOWN, FLORIDA"
4,more brutality from Kang and Hideki,"An excellent disc for anyone interested in the NYC underground new music movement. At times bombastic and truly brutal. Having had the opportunity to actually see Dying Ground live at the Knitting Factory (when they still booked jazz and new music) This disc is a welcome reminder of that evening. Too bad we must pay the inflated Japanese Import price, but worth it."
4,Pleased as Punch,I was a little hesitant to buy this video at first because I hate buying videos that I have never seen before. However this was what my boyfriend wanted as a present. And I am so happy with this series we watched it all in one night and WOW it was amazing. If you want a video that has fun and romance and some twists and turns this is the series for you!
5,"Great Anime! Hard to Find, Worth it!","A great collection of this anime, hard to find sometimes, but kept looking and found it here! Keeps your attention, very well made. Great for those anime lovers out there!"
3,"Almost, but not quite...","I bought this to give out at a bachelorette party. They were fine, except I got 14 and not 16 like I had ordered."
1,Get what you paid for...,"The delivery was fairly on time...but the product itself was ok at best.Only opened one and the smell was sickly sweet. The feel and texture,Though slipery, I fely ot was sticky. Haven't used any others and probably won't."
1,Yuck,"They taste so bad they are not even worth using. I have tried 4 of the 8 flavors and they were so bad I am throwing the rest away,"
2,Ummm...weak,i would never get this again...its way too oozy when u open it. but it does the job.the flavors were fun! quite potent.
3,Pretty good,"The product was pretty good. We haven't tried all of them out yet, but the ones we did try weren't too bad. The orange tasted a little like orange medicine, though."
5,Fun & Sexy Novelty,I suprised my husband with an order of these. The 'flavors' are not really flavors but still lots of fun.
4,Exactly what I was looking for,It's a very nice bandana. The only downside is that the print is only on one side so the other side looks faded.
4,Anne's voice is superlative,"I've always enjoyed Anne's singing and have been lucky enough to play on the same bill with her on several occasions. Although I feel that her style and her bird-like voice are more appropriate in a folk club or pub and that her recordings don't do her justice, there are some strong entries here. The solos, ""Sovay"", ""The Bonambuie"" and ""Bird In The Bush"" are all performed in her own inimitable style with those beautiful embellishments that would cause even the drunks at the bar to stop and listen. She has strong backing here from Steve Ashley on ""Travelling's Easy"" and with Steve, Barry Dransfield et al on ""Sullivan's John"". If you want more, and perhaps better Anne Briggs, get the Fellside Recordings' ""Classic Anne Briggs - The Complete Topic Recordings"""
3,Cute but not very much space,"I love this jewelry case as it is adorable, and very well made. However, I give it a 3 as the storage space is pretty small. It is a small case but you could fit a lot more if it was slightly larger, or if it was a different design. Basically, the cuteness takes away from it's storage capacity. There is good storage for rings in the ring compartment, ok storage for loose items in the little pocket compartment, and good storage for small or stud earrings, but no storage for large earrings, especially hoops, which is mostly what I wear. So if you have small, fine jewelry it would probably be perfect, but for my uses - large chunky silver jewelry items, it doesn't really work. I will still keep it for small trips but it wouldn't be good for anything longer than a few days."
3,Not new age,"This is process music. Jeck picks three or four sources, slows them down, and loops them for long periods of time. Skipping vinyl and digital delay create a wall of sound. He's not afraid of distortion, and some of his loops are downright grating. When it works, the effect is hypnotic and original. When it doesn't, you have plenty of time to wonder why you're listening. I kept picturing the performer at work - most tracks are live - and thinking that I'd rather be watching than listening."
3,Womens Vest,"The vest is very nice material and looks pricey. It is durable and easily wash and wear, but it is not fitted and this would be what I would like as would most women who are not built straight like a man. I am a size 2 to 4 and this vest runs big. It is stretchy so you can actually get a smaller size if you want a more fitted look, check the size chart."
2,Expensive for what you get...,"I did read the few reviews first but thought wth. It is so hard to find a dressy black vest that doesn't look SUPER cheap in the back. I buy most of my work clothes from the junior dept or New York & Co. At NYC I am typically a size S or XS in dress shirts. So when I ordered the smallest size available (6) in ths vest I was dispointed that it was so big. It is not tappered at all! So I will have to pay someone money on top of the $32 the vest cost and the $12 shipping. After all is said and done this vest will end up costing me at least $60! This is a very thin, plain, black vest! I just hope the end result is worth the money."
5,Going Inside!,"Once again, John Frusciante excels at what he does! Every track is wonderful, with my favourite being the second, Time Is Nothing. His latest, Shadows Collide With People is another one to get. He just gets better and better! The only Cd of his I don't own is Smile From the Streets You Hold, but I'm sure one day, I have it!"
3,Informative and Atmospheric,"Dowsing--using a rod to get answers from the earth's energy and water--is explored pretty well in this little documentary, with beautiful scenery and personal testimonial. It also gives you a sense of its history and the kind of people who practice and pursue it."
3,A Little Old,"This book provides a good look at standard pascal, but there is very little comparason to the more modern Turbo Pascal. Digital source code is also unavailable."
5,This book changed my whole outlook on motherhood!,"Wow, this book is the one parenting book that I have read that I can say changed my entire way of looking at my job as a mother. The spirituality of being a parent and the spiritual lessons that await us every single day are now so apparent in my mind after reading this book. My relationship with my spirited child and nursing babe has completely been transformed as I process this book and consciously live out the spiritual moments of my day. Please give this book at least a chance to enter into your journey of parenthood."
1,Another dud from Makoto,"1. As per my other Makoto Ozone reviews, I kind of know what I'm talking about because I have almost every album this guy has produced. Obviously this is a opinion of mine, but his earlier work clearly surpasses all of his more recent output (ie everything since... Nature Boys). Without a doubt, all of his work with this trio has been just so average. Obviously the music isn't horrid; all of these guys are pros. But the music is just so canned and stereotypical; so unlike what Makoto Ozone is capable of and what he has produced in the past. It's just sad to see how such a talented musician can output such bland material.2. Suggestion: check out Makoto's first 3-4 albums as well as Nature Boys; truly inspired material."
3,Nothing special,"K-1 The Arena Fighters is medicore at best.Nothing,I repeat,nothing in this game is perfect.The gameplay is very boring,and 2 player multiplayer is the most stupid thing i've played.This game is very slow paced,too and requires alot of patience.But the music is great,and orginal and the arenas in this game look great,too.This game isnt the worst game ever,but it isnt the best..."
3,Hopefully it's not all downhill from here...,"Well, I bought the CD, and was disappointed. So, like most other CDs I don't like at first, I listened to it many times. Usually, the good CDs will start to win me over, but this one didn't. I keep popping it in from time to time, hoping things will improve, but they don't. If I'd never heard their previous CD ""Turn It Out"" and seen them live, maybe I'd like this disc more. It just doesn't live up to what I've grown to really enjoy about the band.In addition, most tracks have a non-musical, high-pitched carrier-type frequency that really takes away from the listenability. I chalk this up to poor recording/mixing/mastering. This further reduces the disc's enjoyability....but don't let this stop you from giving it a spin yourself..."
4,Smooth Music,"The CD is smooth to listen to. It's not a CD that I would personally play everyday. However, it's great to put in when I have company or a special person over. I learned about the group and CD from a college radio station WCLK 91.9 FM in Atlanta, GA. They mix some of their songs with groups like AFP (Action Figure Party), Maxwell, Groove Collective, and Liquid Soul, to name a few. This CD is also great to listen to on a warm day on a balcony, deck, or at a park. For new listeners of this group, I would suggest listening to some of their samples first before purchasing it. This group is not for everyone."
4,Great,"Other's have described this CD quite well, it's really great that they are continuing to evolve as a band. I wanted to comment however on the recording itself: it seems to be another victim of the current race to have the loudest CD around- it is very loud, but very compressed, and in places sounds distorted. I'm not necesarily a big fan of especially slick and flawless production, but to me it seems like an otherwise good recording has been seriously compromised just to be loud. My 2c."
3,"...DECENT, ALMOST DISTINCTIVE...","this isnt a bad cd but, it's not great either...i love the sound and if i were in a nightclub lissenin' to these guys i would be raving about them...i tap my toes a lil'...snap my fingers some...and on the average i enjoy this cd, but honestly it might only get played once every several weeks. SEVERAL, several weeks. now, ""!!!ROMANTIC!!!""?...i love that song, the woman is just sultry! and the sound is that somethin' SLEAZY i can really sit back and vegetate into; buy it for that song and record it onto a mix-tape or cd with your other favorites...what i do is plug my playstation into my vcr and record six hours of my favorite songs onto a video tape...it's time consuming, but worth the effort!"
2,kinda stinks,"I was expecting more from this updated version of the 1971 book ,""The Garbage People""As a period piece its just ok. Ed Sanders book ""The Family"" is far better and more detailed,and much more interesting.This book jumps all over the place,gets some key facts wrong and misses out on important information...i.e., Paul Watkins,a major player in the real life story,isn't mentioned until the last 10 pages of the book,then only briefly!Also,as mentioned by another reviewer,the author has the annoying habit of incorrectly naming Mary Brunner as Marie O'Brien in the story,yet names her correctly in the accompanying photo,it's been almost 40 years, we don't need the stupid alias' anymore, besides, these people's real names have long been public knowledge,what with all the other (much better)books and various websites.The only positive part was the addition of some new,and frightening photos.Get ""The Family"",or ""The Sharon Tate Story"" instead,this is only for collectors."
1,Regret buying this one,"I regret buying this book. Although Mr. Gilmore substitutes some names like ""Marie O'Brien"" for Mary Brunner, it is obvious who ""Marie O'Brien is. Yet he shows pictures of Mary Brunner using her real name. I was highly disappointed in this book. I expected much more from Mr. Gilmore. I will add this book to my collection and more than likely never read it again. Unless you are an avid collector of Manson Family books, I would let this one pass. Wish I had."
3,manson family,errie and different then the other books on Charles and his disiples.The shaven head and cross on the forehead is a Jewish way of showing that they are not gomorrites ( without morles ) and have remorse for what they did.
3,If you just want to buy it for the pictures...don't,"I know some other[s] have suggested that the morgue pictures are truly horrible. Well, I must be very thick-skinned because they really weren't. The black-and-white photos in this book have been all over the internet already, so they weren't anything I hadn't seen before. ...This book itself is ""just okay"". ..."
5,Thorough Work on Male and Female in Bible,"Thorough interaction with biblical text, feminists and conservative elements on this difficult topic. Also, interacts with social sciences as subtitle suggests.Find his documentation well done and so useful. The material on the scriptural teachings is much more useful to the Christian church than those dealing with the sociological, community issues."
5,A Classic in Mathematical Exposition,"Richard Courant was a master of mathematical exposition, and this is one of his best works. In keeping with Courant's philosphy, this book is free from the excessive abstraction often found even in introductory calculus textbooks. Nevertheless it does not gloss over difficulties in the material, and is in no sense an easy book. This book a complete rewrite of Courant's original ""Calculus"" which first appeared in German. An especially good chapter is the one on the ""Theory of Plane Curves."""
4,Calculus with a strong Analytical Backing,"For people taking a very rigorous calculus course or an introductory Analysis course, this is a good book. Very dense and wordy, but a classic and entirely understandable given enough time."
2,Not up to par,"Despite the hype, this software is really a much clunkier implementation of exemplary dynamic geometry software like The Geometer's Sketchpad and Cabri. I found the interface cluttered and the responsiveness of the software to be sluggish."
3,Review,"Need much more information to make a purchase. No dimensions, nothing about what the chairs are made of. Just a picture is not enough to make a $1000 purchase."
2,Not what is pictured,"I was disappointed when I received this giraffe. My daughter fell in love with her cousin's giraffe which is the one pictured, but is not what we received. The brown patches are much smaller on the one we received. My daughter still likes this giraffe but is disappointed that it is not the same as her cousin's. The one we received looked like this one:TY Classic Plush - HIGHTOPS the Giraffe (LARGE Version - 28 Inches)"
5,A Keeper,"This was a last minute, impulse buy for my daughter's fourth birthday. I have never been so lucky before. The giraffe is impossible not to love. My daughter immediately made a connection with her darling face and named her Daisy. Daisy has been with us everywhere: vacation, the store, school, the Emergency Room... she is my daughter's best friend. The perfect size for carrying under her arm and snuggling in bed. My daughter moves her head around in play and Daisy's so well made that she's lost no stuffing in her neck at all with most toys when they are over-loved. She has paid for herself time and time again."
5,Great!,"I got this for my boyfriend because he fell in love with this tiny giraffe on a commercial. It's the perfect size for that! He's gonna love it! It's a very durable, soft, and loveable little giraffe!"
4,"Great doll, well made",This is one well made giraffe! Our son loves giraffes and has put this through it's paces already within a week of owning it.
2,Not the Same Giraffe,"As another person mentioned, the giraffe does not look like the one shown in the picture. I doubt it's because of photogenic angles or lighting. The patches are smaller and the eyes are more realistic. In my opinion, what I got is fine, but not as cute as the pictured one. While my friend's baby does not care the look, I am a bit disappointed and annoyed about getting a less cute giraffe...I wonder how often this happens. As I'm the second person mentioning, if ""exact look"" is important to you, you might want to give extra time to exchange to get the right one or so."
5,I found it on Amazon,My granddaughter loves giraffe's. We were visiting a friend and they had this Ty - Giraffe. My granddaughter went crazy for it and it was hard for her to leave it when we left. I searched at all toy stores in my area and could not find the Ty Giraffe. Then I thought I would check Amazon and there it was. I ordered it right away and received within a week. IT is a great stuffy and never leaves my granddaughters side. One of the better Ty stuffies. Very Durable as it is getting a lot of loving.
4,Fast Delivery!,"Easy to read, small book. I expected a larger book with more information. It is a good book for the person just getting married to have their eyes opened, and for someone who has been married a long time always thinking the problem is with the other person."
5,Great book,This really is very helpful to get the idea that someone has to be the first to change if you want your marriage to flourish and it really is the best if the wife relingquishes and starts the change. Nancy is a wonderful Godly woman who truly loves those she is ministering to. She is easy to understand and relate to. I trust her advice and biblical knowledge.Tennille Hansen
2,Most disappointing of the recent Uriah albums,"Different World has to be considered one of the most disappointing albums in Uriah Heep history, especially in light of the other three spectacular albums the current line-up has done. Although not awful, the songs are going-through-the-motions rockers with little imagination or innovations and an alarming vacuity of ideas. A Uriah Heep album of any era almost always has one or two great songs on it, songs that grab your attention and make you go ""wow!"" and go on to become classics. No such songs are really on Different World. In fact, many of the songs are indistinguishable from each other, which just doesn't happen on most other Uriah Heep albums. The production, too, is a big comedown from the previous album Raging Silence (although it is somewhat improved in the remaster). If you're looking for modern Heep and aren't a completist, get one of the other albums by the current line-up instead."
5,ABC this Wonderful video,I cannot begin to tell you how much of an impact the Signing Time videos have on my son Ethan. He is more verbal and incredibly excited about learning something new each and every time we watch these videos.This tape was so good even my husband is singing the songs and enjoying himself.
4,LOTS of signs,"I really like Signing Time and this one has LOTS of signs in it - but even after almost 3 weeks, my daughter and I still can't keep up with the main song. When it goes too fast like that, she and I both tend to get frustrated. Otherwise, it's great."
2,Great if you are superfast at signing,"The entire DVD is learning the alphabet, and although the DVD is well-done, the pace is way too fast for me and my toddler. The songs are great, but there's no way I can learn how to sign the ABCs from this video. I REALLY REALLY doubt my son picked up on any of it. I am teaching him sign language due to a speech delay, and he's been able to pick up most/all signs from the first 5 DVDs in this series. I am very disappointed in this DVD."
5,Not just your ABC's!,"This DVD would be worth it's price if all you learned were the ASL signs for the alpahbet, but you get all that and more. For each letter that you learn, Rachel teaches you 2 or 3 more signs for words that start with that letter. You are learning at least 100 signs in this one video alone! The music is the best part. You can't help but sing along and you will most definately find yourself singing the songs long after the DVD is over. The special features are priceless! Rachel slows everything down and really shows you how to do the signs correctly. The very best part is X for X-Ray! I ADORE Hopkins the Frog as he travels across the X-Ray machine. Amazing work, Signing Time, once again!"
4,Happy with Purchase,"Got what I ordered, within a given amount of time. Decent price and am happy with my purchase. I will use this company/seller again if given the opportunity"
5,Very Engaging Video Series,"Rachel Coleman's Signing Times series is not only educational, but very entertaining. I got it for my two and a half year old granddaughter because she signed before she spoke. She loves the music and wanted to watch it over and over. Everything that I've seen in this series is great. It's a fun way to introduce pre-schoolers to signing."
1,Waste of money,"This book is the epitome of useless texts. I used this book for graduate mathematical physics as well as the ""essential"" version for undergraduate math methods. I have yet to learn a single thing from this book or find it remotely useful as a reference.The explanations range from non-existent to shockingly awful to terribly incomplete.It appears that the authors simply vomited a collection of formulas into a word processor and sold it as a textbook.Mathematical Methods of Physics (2nd Edition)is much better."
3,Only for those who are already familiar with the material,"So you know who's writing this, I'm a grad student in Mechanical Engineering.This book is definitely not for anyone who is not already familiar with the subjects in the book, especially if you're in a class that uses this as the textbook since there is not enough explanation in the book to do the problems.Other reviewers have recommended using this as a reference and getting other books if you're trying to learn the material for the first time. I have to agree with that since this was my first exposure to subjects like tensors and the ""explanations"" in the book are disgustingly incomplete.There are several errors (especially in the problem sets) that were not in previous editions. This is unfortunate as one would expect a text to have less errors as time goes on. It wouldn't be a problem except that I can't find any sort of erratta page on the publisher's website or anywhere else.Three stars as a reference book, 1/2 star as a textbook."
3,General reference purposes,"This book was used in my undergraduate/graduate mathematical physics class. The instructor made it quite clear and I agree with his comments that the purpose of the course was to be able to understand the text at the end of the year. Well, I am pleased to say that this goal was attained.The text is an excellent reference. Of course, if rigor is what you are seeking, then I suggest you look elsewhere. Even for a physicist, the proofs and development of the well known equations is quite lacking.In its defense, I will use this book much more than other more rigorous texts when I need to remember simple formalism which can often be the case in graduate physics courses!"
2,I couldn't stand this book,"There are two main things that made me dislike this very popular book. First, the topics are frequently spread along several chapters, making a selective reading at least unpleasant. Second, the examples frequently involve topics of physics not yet covered (like mesons, nuclear physics, etc). I must admit that people I respect like it. I see it more like a collection of formulas with too little connective tissue, and badly organized too."
2,Not good to learn from,"I used this book in a Math Methods 1st year Graduate Physics course, and I dont think I really learned anything from it.It doesnt do well at TEACHING you anything, you'll have to buy another book with examples or find them somewhere, and that itself can be difficult.I found myself referring to Mary Boas' book for a few examples if I wanted to learn anything, but when you get to Group Theory you'll end up lost because the professor will run right over the material and textbooks on that subject arent that great.If i'm looking for an equation or a mathematical rule, this book is great. Ive used it for Quantum and Jackson E&M quite a bit."
2,Just a collection of formula and final result.,"I bought the fifth edition because someone suggested it as the modern text. I am extremely unsatisfied with it. To understand why - just read the chapters on Sturm Liouville Theory, Special Functions and Fourier Series. Can you imagine discussing Fourier Series without clearly specifying what the Dirichlet conditions are? This book is only a collection of useful formula and final result. Try the old classics like Courant and Hilbert or Morse and Feshbach. If you think these are difficult then try Mary L Boas. This book is not worth your money, not even $10."
4,Una buena base de referencia,"Este libro es una buena base para referencia en la materia, pero no es lo ideal si se quiere tomar como texto de estudio. el libro es de dificil lectura, pero sirve como guia de estudio, si se tiene algun texto axuilar o se toma alguna clase en que se expliquen los conseptos. Recomendable si se esta familiarizado con la matemática y la física avanzada."
2,It has its uses,"I write this review because I believe the other two reviews in the customer section give the wrong impression. The material in Arfken should be known by any beginning graduate student in physics. If however one is not familiar with all the topics, one should study an undergraduate textbook concerned with the area of deficiency (which ever is most popular for that subject). Arfken is then best used to jar the memory with examples that are often abridged examples from the aforementioned undergraduate texts. As for an undergraduate taking a course where Arfken is the primary text, I'm confused. Obviously you should know everything in Arfken but he doesn't get to the meat of any given subject. You might as well get cliff notes for physics. (Schaums)"
1,"Awful as a text, semi useful as a reference","Go out and buy Hassani to learn all of the material in this book and much more, buy Schaum's outlines of mathematical tables and formulae for the reference. This book is replete with minimal explanations and problems that are not the equal of the level of presentation. This is absolutly horrid as a text. I used it for a graduate math-physics course but always used other sources to learn from. I should point out that I aced the course but would have probably failed had I tried to learn from arfken."
1,A book for the twentieth century,"This text is hopelessly out of date if one is serious about modern physics. The tired old approach to vector calculus should be relegated to the dustbin of history. Students need, indeed must, learn the exterior calculus of differential forms, not as graduate students but undergraduates, if they can ever hope to get to the frontier. There is so much a student of physics needs to master in advanced mathematics. In this regard it would be very useful if the classical areas such as electromagnetic theory were recast in the language of differential forms."
2,Not my cup of tea,"As an undergraduate student this book was difficult to follow. Explanations were incomplete and it seemed evident to me that the text was made for graduate students, but I had to use it in an undergraduate course. Essential details needed to solve problems were sometimes hidden many chapters ahead. As a reference book for graduate students it's probably pretty good, but I didn't enjoy learning from it one bit."
2,"Decent reference, poor TEXT","Unfortunately, this text holds ominous title of a classic I suppose. This is not a very lucid text, and I would not reccomend it to be used as such. However, if it is a fairly braod reference you are looking for, it might be good. The TOPICS covered are at least at the level of advanced undergrad/beggining grad. But if it's intermediate graduate level + you are interested in, there are others that are definitely better."
1,A poorly organized collection of formulas.,"I found this book quite superficial despite its length. Little more than a compendium of formulas. Poorly organized and typeset. Reasonable price per page, which pushes my rating from 0 to 2. The oldie but goodie (and inexpensive) Abramowitz and Stegun is better for reference and quick lookup. Morse-Feshbach, Courant-Hilbert and even Whittaker-Watson make more sense for in depth study although they are outdated on several topics. Poor in numerical methods and modeling. Unsuitable as textbook."
3,Decent Graduate Text,"This text is a decent text for graduate level mathematical physics. It would be a little over the top for most undergraduate students. However, comparing this to the text I used at the undergraduate level I like this one better. All in all I find this to be a decent text. The problems are moderately to really challenging but ultimately rewarding."
3,Misleading name,"I ordered this product through Amazon, so didn't have the benefit of smelling it. I love tropical scents, and this perfume is tropical smelling, but it doesn't smell like Coco-Mango. The strongest scent you pick up is orange blossom, and I ""tested"" this on a few people and got the same answer. It is a very nice perfume, I just don't like Orange Blossom and felt a little deceived by the name."
3,"getting old, but still worthwhile","This one's a bit of a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that the same author's later Anime Encyclopedia makes the latter half of it (a list of Erotic anime), completely redundant. However, the first half, comprising learned essays on anime topics, remain very intriguing. In particular, this book contains a fascinating study of the media's reaction to anime, and the first account of the shonen ai genre to go into any reasonable depth. Very important for anyone who takes anime seriously, but bear in mind that only part of the book is still relevant today."
2,Levitating globe-- hard to get it to do so,"Globe is somewhat small in size. The main problem is I have a hard time getting it to levitate. Once its levitating, it tends to not stay that way for long. Lately, I've been able to make it stay levitating but adding a round magnet weight I had and stuck it underneath the globe. Obviously not well designed. Seems cheaply made as well (except the globe, which is made in Germany--- but again still should be much bigger)."
2,Blah!,"Got this item as a gift for my Father, didn't expect anything special and I am glad I didn't. Low quality materials and construction. I would say this item is probably now available in any local Dollar Store."
3,stellanova levitating globe,Not that great. I bought this from amazon for $40 and I think it's not value for money. The globe levitate very good but the size is small.
5,Excellent addition to any contemporary decor,"I recently received this item from the Home Decorators Collection through Amazon.com. Having purchased several items from this store, I was anxious to add this piece to my collection. This excellent piece of furniture was fairly easy to assemble, even though the instructions were not very clear. Lots, I mean LOTS, of small screws are required for the hinge assemblies and other parts. If a man wants a cordless drill as a gift, this piece of furniture is the perfect gift for his wife because she would almost have to buy him the drill to get this assembled in a timely manner.The packaging on this heavy (119#) box was excellent, and no damage occurred in transit.Overall, I am very pleased with this item."
5,a children's classic,"I loved this book when I was a child. I recently reread it, and found that it hasn't lost any of its appeal. A well-crafted, perfectly paced, sweet but not sickly sweet story about friendship and courage."
4,Very interesting but real,"I read this book and wondered what would happen next. It was really interesting, I enjoyed it."
5,One of the greatest acoustic guitar albums of all time!,"Just listen to 'Desperadoes waiting for a train';Even if you are not a guitar buff and even if you think drilling for oil is the very depth of wickedness, you can still feel the overwhelming sadness of a oilman's passing from wild exuberance to the faltering dignity of his last monents (a song written by the legendary Guy Clark about his adopted grandfather) where the song reaches out to anyone's own laments over missed opportunities and wasted years.The ending of the song is just a crowning glory which is worth the price of this extraordinary album alone."
1,Quite Bad,"The only good thing about this book is the fact that it is free. But it is so poorly written and constructed, I ended up deleting it off my device and removing it from Cloud Storage."
4,God Research Tool,Read this along with the wonderful Negro spirituals which are written from the richness of the culture but also from the pain and suffering of a tortured people.
2,A Superficial Effort,"This book relies entirely too much on clips from previously published sources. In addition, the authors did not interview many tribal members or people who aided this tribe get on the map. It feels like a book the author was simply rushing to finish. Too bad."
4,A workhorse!,"I bought this almost 5 years ago and I've used it daily ever since. It's gone through countless reprograms and keeps on trucking. Works will all the latest devices. I use it to control XBMC instead of Windows Media Center, and of course the TV, receiver, Uverse cable box, HTPC, etc. It loses one star because:1) The software used to program it can be a bit tricky to get everything controlled correctly2) I couldn't mimic a few buttons from the At&t; Uverse remote, despite manual programmingOther than that, it works great. It's definitely a purchase I would make again."
5,Logitech Harmony 680 MediaCenter,"Fantastic remote! My wife loves the ""Help"" button. I also have a Pronto, NevoSL, and others, and this is really the best bang for the buck, esp for systems with only 3-4 sources. Tech support is also great (no unintelligable accents). Setup is easy too. If you have a Crestron or AMX but are tired of out-of-sync's or paying for programming, this is the way to go!"
2,Was a good remote now not so good,"This remote was perfect for Media center until the last software version. For some reason Logitech saw fit to mess this remote up. It is no longer a Media center remote. They have made the green media button, which was the most important button on the remote, inoperable with media center. you have to go into the display menu and find the button to bring up media center and the media center main menu now. Ridiculous. Actually as soon as a find a replacement I will be selling mine."
1,No More TV Listings?,"This is actually a pretty good remote and the setup for configuration is usable. However, it appears Logitech has stopped providing downloadable TV listings to the remote. This makes the remote much too expensive and defeats a big benefit. It also call into question Logitech's commitment to newer remotes."
1,Harmony has discontinued the program guide,"It's true - Harmony discontinued the program guide feature. Their reasoning - it was too expensive for them. There are a lot of universal remotes out there, but the tv listings were what sold me on the Harmony. Zapping through the listings on my remote was way easier than using my cable box's on-screen guide, and for my tv's where I use CableCard I don't even have an on-screen guide.Aside from that, there are serious quality control problems. My first remote was DOA. For the replacement, the battery cover broke off (a common problem according to internet forums). Now a key on the keypad has fallen off, and Harmony made me pay for a new keypad since the one year warranty has expired.I understand that Harmony was once a great company, but it seems to have gone downhill since it became part of Logitech."
5,This is the only remote you need,"The Haromony 680 has taken the place of my TV remote, DVD remote, and Tivo remote. It's the best Christmas gift I could've gotten! My son programed it, did a bit of twiking to make it respond more quickly for Tivo use, and now I just enjoy using it. I took all the batteries out of my other remotes and stored them in a nearby drawer, in case I needed them, but I haven't had any reason to use them. My eyes aren't what they used to be, so at first,I had to put on my glasses to see what the function buttons were for, but now that I've used the remote for a while, I've gotten used to the buttons and don't have to ""read"" them anymore. Shifting from live TV to Tivo or DVD and back again is quick and simple. The Harmony 680 will even eject the DVD for me."
5,If only the bottle was larger...,"I run out of this quickly, which is rare for me because I'm picky about texture and fragrance when it comes to body lotion. Usually a body lotion will sit in my cupboard for a year and then get tossed because it doesn't live up to my stringent standards. This one is light, non greasy, not sticky, yummy smelling (natural floral), and it doesn't break me out or give me a rash. The reason I wish the bottle was bigger is because my boyfriend sneaks this lotion, and before I know it the tube is empty!"
4,Music with a gospel touch!,"The first time I listened to this recording of ""The Storm Is Over Now"", and when I watched the music video, I noticed that there was a very strong gospel touch in this song. Even the beat showed many people clothed in white clapping to the beat, like what would usually happen in a church worship session!"
5,Let's Have Faith,This a great cd. I love every song. And I believe him and prayer for everything he as done and will do.I Love You R.Kelly
5,"Awesome Gospel, Spiritual, Heartfelt & Beautiful Song ...!!","This is one of the Greatest Gospel Songs R.Kelly has ever made. If you don`t gonna buy the single, buy a copy of the ""TP-2.COM"" ALBUM, it is also on this CLASSIC ALBUM. SO BUY IT WHETHER IS THE SINGLE OR THE ALBUM."
1,These bars are awful.,"I threw the whole box away, I had one bar and couldn't believe how awful they tasted. Save your money and buy the Atkins bars, they taste much better."
1,Horrible,This video was horrible. Very cheesy production - more a video of a marginal beginning dance class than a professionally produced video production with any pre-planning. Don't buy it - you will not be happy.
4,"Fallen Angels, II","Reminded me of the old black & white, ""Who Done It"". All stories were good, but ""Dead-end for Delia"" was my favorite. There is quite a twist to this story."
4,Love them,"I have never used or had anything like these before but I love them. They are not perfect and sometimes let in a little light around the nose area. Also if you make them bigger by adjusting the velcro, it exposes velcro on the back and could catch on your sheets if you have sheets that catch. Mine don't and are fine. All in all I like them, helps me stay in bed in the morning when the sun is up."
2,Incredibly uncomfortable,"Maybe it is because I am a petite woman with a smaller head, but I found this mask to be unbelievably uncomfortable. First off, the velcro in the back is thick and stiff and it went across the entire back of my head making it really difficult to sleep on my back. The eye part is over sized and kept pushing down over my nose. I've had prior sleep masks that had Velcro but didn't use such a stiff, thick, long strip of it. To make it small enough to fit, I'm probably going to have to cut the Velcro bits off and sew it together. As it is this mask won't stay on and with the Velcro makes sleeping impossible."
1,Poorly made,"Cheap material. A seam came apart after 3 uses. The fit is not good, there are gaps along the bottom allowing light to come through. The only way to alleviate that is to tighten the Velcro to an uncomfortable point.I regret this purchase and am looking for a replacement."
2,Good while it lasted,"I have the other Bucky eye mask that comes with earplugs and is made of a velour type material and I love it! I recommend it to everyone I know! Because of that, I thought this one would also be great for the warmer months. It was great for the first month until it started falling apart. The liner between your eyes and the foam started coming unglued gradually until it was almost completely unglued. Today I went and bought some spray adhesive to try to get a couple more months out of the mask but it is hard to spray the adhesive because the liner is sewn at two points so you have to try to get the spray between the two layers. It isn't worth the trouble. Next time it falls apart, it will go in the garbage. I do not recommend this item and would appreciate any recommendations for similar lightweight sleep masks that are more durable."
3,Eye Mask,"I really like this mask, except it does not seal well on the bottom to stop the air from my c-pap machine from blowing in my eyes. Otherwise it fits nicely and keeps the light out."
3,blinky mask - disappointed,I was disappointed in this item because it wasn't as comfortable as I thought it would be based on the description of the item. It did press against the eyes and the strap wasn't comfortable. I had to return to item.
3,"Good, but short life","I want to rate these masks higher. They block out the light perfectly, they fit the face well, they're attractive. I kinda love them. However, the lining peels up after just a few months of use. I have to wonder if something changed with manufacturing because the first mask I bought lasted MUCH longer than the last 2 (I'm on mask #4). If you don't mind considering them as something you'll have to replace after about 8 months, then I'd totally recommend them. They do the job very, very well...while they last."
5,The best I've found.,"Of all the eye masks I've tried, this one is by far my favorite. I love that the mask doesn't touch my eyelids, and I only have VERY minimal light leaks. My hair does get stuck in the velcro closure at the back, but I have a large head, so I find that most other eye masks are too tight. I'll sacrifice a few pulled hairs for something that fits properly. I'm on my second Bucky mask because I accidentally washed the first one with my sheets and the backing came off of the mask. They're delicate and should probably only be hand washed. I'm completely satisfied with this mask and doubt I'll ever have a desire to try another style or brand."
2,Falling apart after 2 weeks of use & you can see some light,Although this mask is relatively comfortable you still can see some light through the flaps on your nose. The really bad thing is that it's falling apart after a few weeks of use. Not sure if it's important but I'm a side sleeper.
3,item itself works ok but quality lacks,i have purchased one of these sleep masks before from the manufacturer. when i purchased this one to replace it i had only had it for a few months before the fabric started to come apart. the quality is terrible. i don't know why the amazon product wouldn't be as good but it wasn't. i won't buy these from amazon again.the item itself let's in light around the nose but i tolerate it because it's so light and the strap is easy to adjust since it's wide and velcro. i'm still hunting for the perfect sleep mask though!
2,It fell apart,"It was nice in structure and function but the material couldn't hold up to nightly use thus the mask layers began to separate. Nice company, they replaced it, the second replacement fell apart as well."
2,Not Built To Last,"I found this to be a very comfortable sleep mask, however after only a couple months of use it began to fray around the edges.In less than 6 months it had completely come apart. Based on this I cannot recommend this sleep mask."
4,Keeps the Light Out,"This fits pretty well over the nose and eyes, but could be a little more pliable / flexible. It helps me sleep by doing what it's supposed to do: keep the light out."
3,Disappointed...,"I purchased this mask for use while on vacation, sleeping in a bedroom that gets bright early morning light. The front of the mask was very comfortable, but I found the elastic band too wide & the Velcro closure too thick & uncomfortable, to work well for me. Being a side-sleeper, unless I had the band on my head very snuggly, the mask would push away from my eyes & allow the light in each time I placed my head on the pillow & when changing position from one side to the other. I couldn't seem to make it feel comfortable & also stay in place -- so, I ended up not using it."
1,Worthless! A T-shirt is better.,"This mask has some serious strap flaws.1) The strap is too thick. One strap over laps and attaches to the other strap and creates a THICK piece of fabric which digs into the back of your head. Not very relaxing.2) The strap slides around, usually down toward my ears. Again, not very relaxing.3) The Velcro is the wrong method for this type of adjustable strap. With Velcro there is the soft piece with the loops and the scratchy piece with tiny hooks that attach to the loops on the other piece with loops. With this mask, the scratchy side faces down toward the pillow and keeps pulling threads our of my pillow case. Great. Thanks for ruining my silk pillow cases.If you reverse the strap, then the scratchy side digs into your scalp. Wonderful.My advice: forget the mask. And use a T-shirt to cover your eyes. It works better and is much more comfortable."
2,ALMOST TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"Bucky Sleep Mask.I was disappointed.The layers became appart and it last just 4 months. I can still use it, but it's uncomfortable so far.Nevertheless,I deserve a new one : I think it is a good design.(I tryed to restore it, but it did not work ).(Was it made in china?)Thanks."
3,It's ok for the price,"I work 12h midnight shifts and need to find ways of getting better sleep so I bought this mask to try. I like the fact that it has indents for the eyes, but for me, I can still see a little light on the bridge of the nose. I've tried to move it around but there's still light. I think there needs to be some type of metal bracket there to pinch close to the nose that would work I think. It does work decent enough though for the price."
4,good purchase for the money,"I bought this mask for my business traveling husband. The mask was a little bigger than I had expected(it makes him look like a bug!), but he says that it has been comfortable and only lets in a little bit of light at the nose."
5,I can sleep in peace!!!! :o),"I am so happy with this mask! It is incredibly soft and conforms to my face as soon as I put it on. I never used a sleep mask before, but I just moved into a loft apartment where the rooftop windows in the bedroom let the sun peek in as soon as it rises, and the blinds only do so much. I can now sleep in peace knowing that I won't get awoken any earlier than I already have to get up!My only concern is the placement of the straps on my head. I have been playing around with where they lay for the past few nights, and it seems like a learning process to find the right spot (above the ears? over the ears? under a ponytail?). Once I figure it out I am sure it will be even better than it already is! :o)"
3,"Great when new, but don't last long","I've had a couple of these. They're very comfortable and work well for the first couple of months, but if you use your mask every day, the elastic becomes loose and the top layer of the mask begins to peel off. Does not wear as well as comparably priced sleep masks."
3,"Cute but nose area does not lay flat on skin, letting some light in.","I got this in ""mums"" and black (for me and my husband). My husband has taken a liking to it and I see him use it pretty much every night. I use it occasionally... the mums print is so cute!!! But I like it primarily for the unique print and SOMEWHAT ergonomic, contoured shape. The shape looked great in photo, but it doesn't lay flat on the sides of my nose... the inverted ""V"" shape part is a tad too wide/big for me. Perhaps if you had a bigger nose or the entire nose area were sticking out more, this would fit perfectly. I almost wish that they just cut a slit for the nose instead of a ""V"", so the flaps will lay over the sides of the nose.. I would imagine that will fit more people's facial shape and will keep lights out more effectively. I wonder if I should've tried the ""Lights out"" one also available on Amazon... but they just weren't as stylish : P"
1,Not impressed.,This mask would have been great if the inner lining didn't peel off and tickled your eyelids while you slept. I would recommend looking for another mask that is not cheaply made.
5,Bucky Eye Mask,"I have tried various masks over the years, and this is the best one I've ever owned. It does a great job keeping the light out, and I can barely feel it on my face... and what I do feel is very soft and comfortable. The elastic is neither too thick nor too thin, and connects in back with Velco, so it's adjustable. I often use it at home, and always bring it with me when I travel; somehow the hotel curtains NEVER close all the way."
2,Won't stay on,"When I can get them to stay on, they do a good job of keeping the light out. However,I have yet to have them stay on all night."
3,Expected more...,"I read in many places travelers saying great things about this mask, but I haven't found anything special about it. The strap is uncomfortable, with stiff velcro sometimes scratching my ears and doesn't hold at all, the mask slips off or at least the straps wander around. It is not possible to sleep sideways without moving the mask, and eventually removing it.Iis not bad as it blocks light and is wearable, but feels just like a normal airplane give-away mask with better place for your eyes.I have yet to find a side sleep mask comfortable enough for everyday."
2,I really want to give this a higher rating,"The mask is comfortable and does a great job of keeping light out, but there are 2 significant problems with the design/construction:1. The strap that goes around your head is fairly bulky and takes some getting used to. In addition when you roll over, depending on how tight you have the mask, the strap may ""stick"" to your pillow rather than your head, thus causing the mask to shift off of your eyes.2. The bigger problem is simply the construction. As others have mentioned, the inner lining is not attached well at all to the mask. I've had my mask for a few months and the lining is now coming off beneath both eyes."
3,Sturdily constructed,very nicely made but only awarded 3 stars from me due to my big honking nose not allowing a tight seal thus allowing too much light to penetrate for my liking. If I had an average sized nose I can see myself being happy with this. I still use it on occasion when I really need it. As a night shift worker i would like to find an eye mask that has a wider back strap that doesnt interfere with my ears I can wear everyday. This is not it.
5,Love it,I had a similar sleep mask before this one. I still love the shape. The molded eye cups are so helpful. WIth other sleep masks my eyes would get irritated but never with this one since there's room for my eyes to blink and breathe even while blocking out the light. I also really really like the pattern. It seems silly but it really does help me keep track of it better.
2,Effective (To a Degree),"Pretty comfortable and adjustable. Great for taking a nap when it's not possible to get the room 100% dark. However, I am a bit disappointed because mine has already started to come apart, and it's been only 4 months. May buy another one, but first I'm going to try other brands. Sigh."
3,Comfortable but poor quality,"The mask keeps it dark during daylight for the most part, though a bit of light comes in through the nose area.I first owned the Dots style and it feel apart after a while, the lining came off. Now I have the all black one and have found it to stain other fabrics and leave black color on what it lays upon - probably including my face.If I find something of higher quality I will move on from this product. But for now I like how it cups over my eyes instead of the standard eye mask which lays directly on top of the eyelids."
3,Just OK,"This mask is okay for flying, but not that great for sleeping (in bed). The velcro on the straps gets stuck in my hair, then pulls it. My biggest complaint, however, is the light that comes through the mask. Bright light will come through the nose slits and the material doesn't completely block all light (you will not have total darkness if wearing to sleep during day)."
2,Falls apart with nightly use,"I LOVE this mask and wear it every night. However, after just a few months the inner liner peels away and I have to throw the mask away. This shouldn't be a disposable item! I keep buying new ones because they're so comfortable. BUCKY, PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM! If you only wear it occasionally, like for plane travel, it's the one to buy."
2,"Was great, fell apart quickly","I have a lot of trouble sleeping with even the tiniest amount of light, so I use an eye mask every single night. The Bucky mask is indeed ultralight, and I liked how the eye cups were molded so the mask wasn't laying completely against my face, since that tends to make me sweat sometimes.Unfortunately though, after only 2-3 months, the black fabric lining the inside started to peel completely away from the edges. I kept using it for a while, but now it's barely hanging on around the nose. I had to stop using it, and now I'll be looking to try a different brand. Too bad :("
2,Effective but VERY POORLY CONSTRUCTED.,"VERY POORLY CONSTRUCTED. While the mask is comfortable and blocks out all but a wee bit of light from the nose area, it is falling apart after only a few weeks of use. The inner liner (part that touches the face/eye area) is already separating from the mask. I would return it if I could, but I believe it's considered ""used"" (unreturnable) at this point. Also, thin strap means it slips off easily, competing (better) ones have a wide, sash-like strap."
4,I am Batman.,"This is my only experience with a sleep mask and I bought it to help me to sleep after day break. No mask can fit everyone's face perfectly. In my case, I have to wear it a little high on the bridge of my nose to keep it from impacting my breathing. This position lets light in between my eyes - not much, but enough to matter. The mask is comfortable if worn loosely, but this won't work if you toss-and-turn a lot. The material is soft and comfortable, but I didn't use it enough to judge durability. I was impressed that the raised area works so that your lashes don't brush if you blink. I guess it works OK, but I've gone back to putting a small towel over my eyes when the sun wakes me."
2,lining peeled off,I would've reviewed this 5 stars if the inside lining hadn't come completely off within the first few weeks.love it except for that one - very major - issue.
2,comfortable but lets in light,"lets in light through the sides of the nose, if you have a puny small nose then dont worry about it, this product is for you. If you sleep on your side or on your back this bucky sleep mask is not for you at all because it slides off no matter how you adjust it."
3,Not Bad,Strap is on the limit of adjustment for smaller heads. Mask lets some light in. Consider marketing versions for small and large heads instead of one size fits all.
5,Love my night goggles,"This was a great purchase for my trip. I used it on the plane as well as in the hotel room when there was too much light or my roomie had the lights on . You kind of look like a pink eyed bug since they are a little big. Plenty of room to move your eyes, fun pattern, adjustable head band."
2,Falls apart over time,"I really liked this mask, but after a few years the inner and outer layers have separated from the foam inside so I had to throw it away. Maybe it's not meant to last that long? I have another one that's a few years old and it still looks just fine."
4,Boyfriend loved it!,got it for my boyfriend who would be sleeping during the day due to his job. He had one before from Sharper Image and he thought this was just as good. Liked how it didn't squash his eye lashes.
3,Bucky 40 Blinks Mask Ultralight Eye Mask - NouveauPattern,"Good Eye Mask. I've been using the mask for approximately nine months now. It's somewhat true to its description; it is in fact very comfortable, and the contour design is excellent, with plenty of room for ""eye fluttering"", and the pattern I purchased is very pretty and true to its description. However, when it comes to blocking out light...it does not. Light definitely seeps through the bottom. Moreover, it tends to slide off (more often than not). As many other reviewers attested, it is definitely a great mask for traveling, etc. I'm still using it on/off (I have another mask that works really well for sleeping). Unfortunately, I can't 100% recommend this mask for ""actual"" sleeping or blocking out light, but would definitely recommend for traveling, or relaxing for a short while; hence my 3-rating."
2,"Does Mostly What it says, but 2 have come apart on me in 3 Months!","I purchased the first one through an outside vendor. I really loved that it was light-weight & contoured to my eyes.But after 2 months the inside lining separated from the mask itself.I phoned Bucky inquiring as to the issue. They were extremely helpful and said there was a small batch that did this.I purchased a second one through them directly.The problem is, they only have a 30 money back. Now, the 2nd pair has separated after only 3 months! So sad, to be on the market for yet another one that actually works and is built to last!"
3,Great mask with problems,"I have had 3 of these masks now, in 3 different colors. The eye design is wonderful and comfortable in any position. I have never had a problem with the velcro closure on the back of my head. I sleep upright in a recliner due to neck problems. My issue with the mask is the lack of quality in the construction. This mask is apparently glued together around the edges. After 3 months of continuous use, the edges are pealing off. It looks like I have 2 masks on top of each other. I would buy this again if it were cheaper or put together better. I am now forced to find another alternative because I can't afford a new one every 3 months."
2,falls apart in about a month,"I've gone through 2 of these. They're comfortable, and are nice in that they don't press on my eyes, but the glue that holds the cloth layers on is weak enough that the external layers of cloth begin peeling away and render the mask unwearable."
2,"Not comfortable for me, lets in too much light","Wow, am I ever disappointed in this mask. It gaps all around my nose, particularly if I lay on my side. If I am on my side, it also slides around uncomfortably if I move my head even slightly - gapping even more. If I lay on my back, it gaps less, but there is a lump formed by the velcro that makes this position uncomfortable too. I don't know what is harder -- falling asleep without the mask with way too much light in the room, or falling asleep with this darn thing on and bright slivers of light still getting in. Seems like this mask works for a lot of people, but not for me. I have a narrow nose bridge -- maybe that is the problem for me."
2,Ouch from a Side Sleeper,"Nice design for a back sleeper, but won't stay in place or hurts a side sleeper. Oh, and velcro and hair don't mix, so really it's not adjustable, because if you don't completely match up the velcro halves, you may wind up with your hair locked onto the exposed part (unless you don't have hair:-)"
1,not made to last,"I use to love this product, however this version of the Bucky 40 blinks eye mask is not made to last. With in a month the lining that rest on the face peels away. I thought I may have gotten a defective mask yet me second mask also peeled away with in a month. The eye mask it's self is to narrow and lets light in. The elastic strap is very uncomfortable and leaves tender spots on my head. Very disappointing. Wish they would go back to the older version."
2,Mask traps heat,"This mask not only leaks light under the eyes but the material traps heat. I think the material just doesn't breathe very well and I can't stand it. Also, the velcro on the back strap is thick and makes the strap more uncomfortable."
5,good eye mask,this is my first mask so far its comfortable and stays on all night. material is soft and easy on the eyes
2,I would not recomend,This mask did not work for me. It felt comfortable when I went to bed but i would wake up throughout the night. I am a side sleeper so the straps would rub against my ears an irritate them. It was not comfortable. I tried it for two night and just gave up on the mask.
2,Would give 5 stars if it lasted more than a couple months...,"The first month of near nightly use I was loving this eye mask. Blocked all the light allowing me to fall asleep more easily. I would give this eye mask 4 stars if it didn't fall apart so quickly. Like others have said, the inner fabric started to peel off around the nose at first, then continued to un-glue up toward the temple area... then off to both sides. Pretty disappointed =(. Also the velcro on the back is a bit thick and may cause some frustration. For me it bothered me some nights, but not others. I'm going to try and sew the lining in and see if the stitching doesn't bother me..."
2,"Fell Apart Within 2 weeks, disappointed!!","Let me first say that I really like this product, it is extremely comfortable and does an excellent job blocking out light, however what good is it if it falls apart in two weeks? I have purchased these masks in the past and got a very reasonable amount of use out of them(8-12 months used every night) before they fell apart. But, this time, the inner liner came off both masks within two-weeks of use. So, what to give it for stars, hmm, well 5-stars for comfort and functionality minus three stars because I couldn't enjoy the functionality for very long."
4,"Comfortable and effective, but the wear out quickly","This is the best sleep mask i've found so far, of the half dozen or so i've tested. It's lightweight, blocks almost all the light, and it's comfortable.The only problem with it is it's not made to last. The material comes away at the edges, showing the foam inside. At this price though, just buy a few like I do, as it's the best mask I've found."
5,Puma Strasbourg Jacket/Pants,This is the best jacket and pant set. Love the pants they are slimming and look great not like bulky sweatpants but a very tailored slimming look. A+++
2,JMS should've quit Spidey while he was ahead,"This, like all of JMS' Spider-Man stories since ""Sins Past"" has been disapointing. It is not completely unreadable, and I continue to enjoy Mike Deodanto's art since he came back onto the scene, but compared to the the the great Spidey tales out there, this one is very missable. If you're new to Spider-Man check out Essential Marvel Team Up to see some great Spidey, or the first few trades of the current run with JMS and Romita Jr. they're a lot better than this one focusing on some minor character from Parker's past (who I don't beleive we, the reader, have ever met before). It starts out interesting exploring what could've happened if Peter wasn't so responsible, but quickly turns into cliched hero vs. villain fare."
2,Bleck. Stay away from this one.,"While not nearly as bad as the previous arc, SINS PAST, the story in SKIN DEEP is still very poor. It focuses on some obscure character who hasn't existed in prior to this arc. Yet, this new character who has never been mentioned all of a sudden shows up and goes on a personal vendetta, and the target is Peter Parker. The villain in this arc seems like a bad rip-off of Molten Man, an older villain who dates back to the Ditko issues of Amazing Spider-Man. Overall, the story is dull, unimaginative, and predictable. The only reason you might want to pick this up is so you know why Peter, MJ, and May move into a new residence right after this story..."
2,Save your money from buying this book and take your own trip,"Dr. Bruce likes to refer to ""scientific studies"" to substantiate some of her claims without citing the source of these supposed studies. The most preposterous being the ""study"" about the ""randomized"" trial to test the effectiveness of long-distance prayer, presumably the Harris et al study done in 1999. These and other studies such as the Columbia Miracle study in which it was reported that women prayed for from thousands of miles away by strangers were more likely to become pregnant than those who weren't are studies that have turned out to be a fraud.Although the book is interesting when Bruce talks about her family and her reasons for studying shamanism, her details and descriptions of the visions are just too freaky.I also don't buy what she says about a person being able to genuinely change from without before changing from within. I think this claim is only used to justify her career."
3,Vince Russo - Give the guy a break and read his story.,"This is the first of two bios that Vince has written. It gets a little too ""preachy"" at times as he is a born again christian, but he makes some solid points about the death of WCW, and his involvement with WWE. I read this after his second book ""Rope opera-how WCW killed Vince Russo"" and was surprised at some of the revelations he made. (Im not giving them away here, buy the book like I did!)If you can get through the efforts to save your soul (As I do believe Vince is sincere in his efforts, just really preachy!) you can find a really good read. Vince has had a rough time adjusting to the ""Real world"" as most guys in the business do. He discusses a lot of those difficulties.All in all, a good read."
3,Only half the story,Vince Russo's Forgiven is a fairly good read with his versions of his time in the WWF. The book does not cover his time in WCW or TNA and that is the book I would like to read. In this book he states several times how he was a changed man and would never go back to wrestling. Well shirtly after the book was released guess who went back to writing for TNA after his christian themed wrestling promotion crashed and burned after one show.
3,"""Forgiven"" - Vince Russo",This is an interesting bio unlike any other wrestling biography. If you're interested in WWF through the 90's this is a must read.
3,Surprisingly Recommended,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. Russo bares his soul and you get the feeling that he is a better man for all he has endured in his life. A lot of questions are answered here. Surprisingly recommended.GeorgiaWrestlingHistory.com"
5,"If talking about religon makes you squirm, read this!","Once again, Bruce and Stan have managed to combine humor and practical advice to bring a relationship with God to a human level. This book give a new perspective on sharing your faith in a non threatning manner, without pressure or fear. Even if you are a ""closet Christian"" you can benefit from this book."
5,An absolutely annointed knockout for all women.,"This book is a must read. Lorna Wren allowed God to use her in such a way that all women can relate in some form or fashion. Naked and not ashamed she reveals her pain, not just her pain but the pain of so many women in the house of God and out of the house of God."
2,"Great for the arcade, a breeze for the SNES","You first selects as one of three pit fighters to compete against a slew of amazing brutal pit fighters (a whole 7). This is your normal fighting game, no blood, no fatalities, the only difference is that there is more of a playing field, you can move around the total pit, rather than just moving left and right on a platform like other fighting games. There are pretty simple moves, punches, kicks, sweeps, yada yada, which make the game get old really quick. The only good thing about the game is its huge challenge and special rounds, such as when you must fight tigers! Rent it, don't buy it."
1,"Too slow, it's almost too simple","Pit Fighter for it's time was a good game. But even with games of it's time, it wasn't as great (this game came out in 1991). you could only be 3 characters, all of which were fairly decent and more or less the same with the addition of a few moves and subtraction of a few moves.The only thing that really held this game up was it's challenge, it's bonus rounds and it's easy play. It was almost too easy at times. Plus you could use the entire screen to fight a match instead of scrolling left and right. It might not be worth buying because it gets real old real quick so maybe rent this one first."
4,fun game worth the buy for ghost in the shell fans,"product came as described. very like the series as a game, had to have it kind of easy and progresses to harder"
4,It is very different than the shooters of the time,"Ghost in The Shell is the first game based off of the Ghost in The Shell Manga and Cyberpunk movie series.Plot: You are a rookie at Public Security Section 9. You pilot a Fuchikoma tankand stop terrorists, the Human Liberation Front in Newport City. 9/10Graphics: The Graphics are very colorful and work very well between area's from sewers to the city. 7/10Sound: The soundtrack was very well placed and even got its own album Ghost in the Shell: Megatech Body 7/10Gameplay: From climbing buildings to fighting bosses the Gameplay is great and action packed. The downside is I hated the timed missions 8/10Overall: it is very different than the shooters of the time as it was very different than Doom. This is a must have, for and Gits or 1st and 3rd person tank game fans alike. 7.75"
3,"OK, but could have been better","I am a big Judith McNaught fan and I was looking forward to reading Nicky's story. I had hoped that the author would have written a full-length novel for this fascinating character, originally introduced in Whitney My Love and recurring in Until You. I would have loved to see more details on the characters' developing relationship; it would have made it more believable."
5,Introduction to flowering trees for the tropics,"This is really neat little book, well-printed and with top quality color pictures. The pictures are supported by brief and informative texts. The book gives a good overview of trees that blossom profusely with showy flowers and that are suitable for planting in the tropics. Beyond an emphasis on (C-& S-) American species and the use of Florida common names there is nothing in the book that ties it to Florida in particular."
4,Classic Cuban,"At first listen I was somewhat dissapointed, hoping to find more of the original soundtrack music on it but...there are some real gems here in the Cuban repetoire and this has become one of my favorites. Check out Ay Mariposa by Pedro Ferrer and Por Que Me La Dejaste Querer? by Bola de Nieve, Carter Burwell's original soundtrack piece 'Baloon Escape' and Kamata Mariyam by Fairuz. I would only question the voice over at the end of the record... I don't know why producers never seem to understand that when we buy soundtracks we want to hear music not dialog excerpts."
4,Beyond the simplistic pattern of recognition,"I strongly disagree with those reviews that strictly link music in cinema with the images to which apparently they are connected to. In the case of Before Night Falls, Schnabel, if he didn't pick up the right music acording to the times when the action takes place - which any good listener must thank, just imagine that Annia Linares in a background while Arenas is being persecuted by the secret police of Castro's Cuba -, he rightly used the tracks as dramatic elements in the elaboration of the scenes. Just, after the horrific events of September 11, we can pay more attention to that scene of Reinaldo and Lazaro enjoying the snowfall in that old car wandering the streets of NYC, watching those tall buildings, while Fairuz sings melancholy and woefully that Kamata Mariyam. It really gave me the creeps."
1,Missing lots of music from the film,"Julian Schnabel ultilized much more music than this osundtrack provides. Two essential missing pieces:(1) the police raid of the fiesta (the one which Javier's tour guide friend takes him to) contains a three minute montage to the adaigetto of Mahler's 5th symphony (which is by the way, a very banal and naive use of music).(2) The music depicting the sea and Javier's disasterious flight from Cuba on the makeshift raft is lifted from Popol Vuh's original soundtrack to Werner Herzog's ""Aguire the Wrath of God"". In fact, Schnabel shamelessly copies Herzog's use of the music- to depict the enorminty of nature compared to miniscue man.Final word, this film is too sappy- Schnabel is not humble enough, because his craft remains weak."
2,Dissapointed,"Although I don't usually write negative reviews, I think this item is more than deserving. To begin, this is the only soundtrack you can buy; while most movies have an original score and a various artist album (when applicable), both are truncated into this single volume. Much of the various artist music is available, but only two original pieces are presented, one with Javier Bardem speaking as Reinaldo Areanas in Spanish (the scene in the movie in the cab in New York), a memorable monolouge indeed, but it doesn't fit on the soundtrack.The only real problem is that this one volume edition listed as an original soundtrack is not comprehensive and mostly unoriginal."
1,"If a picture is worth 10,000 words, a song is..?","The soundtrack really doesn't hold up without the visual. It's not a convincing representation of what was being listened to in Cuba at the time. No Mirta y Raul, no Annia Linares, no Son 14, no Ritmo Oriental, no Van Van."
3,Would be great if ...,"This cat toy would be great if each leg of the triangle were extended about an inch and the whole thing made slightly heavier. My cat is medium sized, about 8.5 pounds, and she just barely fits on the top. She will sleep on hammock top or play from there if I put her on the top of the triangle. The flip n' fun is just not stable enough and big enough for her to want to go up on top on her own. I have tried to figure out a way to extend the area of the triangle to no avail, which is so frustrating because this would be the perfect toy if only it were a little bigger."
4,Turning The Pages In Time,"Behind the Scenes by Elizabeth Keckley is the inspiration behind the book Mrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker by Jennifer Chiaverini. It is a memoir of sorts of Elizabeth Keckley, who was Mary Todd Lincoln's modiste (dressmaker), friend, and confidant. Chiaverini's book closely follows Behind the Scenes, so there was not much that I gleaned from reading it. The interesting part, though, were the letters of Mrs. Lincoln's at the end. It was interesting to understand Lincoln's thoughts in her own words and see just how distraught and sad she was after her husband's assassination. It is obvious that she felt everyone was out to destroy her. Sadly, she might not have been far from the truth."
2,Disapointed,"This book has some historical interest but falls short of expectations. I found the description of the legal process for the emancipation of a slave and life in the whitehouse interesting. The sophistication of the writing style and the lack of any reference to Keckly's education leads me to suspect that it was put together by a ghost writer. That's OK but the historical coverage, while occasionally interesting, was very limited. The account after Lincoln's assasination was limited to the pecuniary embarrasment of Mrs. Lincoln and a fanciful description of trips back home."
3,The Lincoln white House,The delivering came sooner than I expected in good condition and the story is short is good and yet at the same time need to finish off properly it has a strange ending. I prefer the Mary Todd's diary it is the best book to read about the Loving Mr Lincoln great insight.
2,Didn't like,Interesting but got a little slow and boring at the end. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends.
3,"Interesting Read, but slow at times","Had to read this for my book club. It was interesting, but boring at times. I did learn a bit about Mrs. Lincoln through the eyes of her dress maker. Nonetheless an interesting perspective."
1,Major Disappointment,"I'm a big fan of Mary Todd Lincoln material and have never been less than fascinted reading about her...until now. The book, with small print and no photos, is very ""light-weight."" You'll read it in half-an-hour. And it concentrates only on one (minor) element of Mary's life (with Elizabeth), Mrs. Lincoln's auction of her clothes. Very disappointing purchase for anyone seeking to learn something about Mary and/or the many years that she and Eliz. knew each other."
1,The Life Of A Slave,"This is my least favorite book on the Lincolns. It's the story of Elizabeth Keckley, who was a slave. Elizabeth eventaully becomes Mary Todd Lincoln's dressmaker and friend. This is a lot more about slavery than the Lincolns.I don't mind reading about the subject. I just didn't think it was a very well-written book on Elizabeth's part."
5,Very Good Book,"I enjoyed this book very much. It is easy to get lost in the time of Lincoln and in the life of this remarkable woman who pulled herself up from slavery. The details of the life of Mrs. Lincoln that one would never believe if not read here were enlightening. Very interesting and an easy, enjoyable read."
5,AMAZING WRITING FROM FORMER SLAVE,"I was amazed, truly, by the vocabulary and writing style of a former slave. So intelligent, and I believe an honest reflection of Mary Todd Lincoln from an intimate friend. So good to know there was someone who loved and took such good care of this special lady. History has been unkind to her....medical problems that could now be so controlled with medications."
4,Excellent book but...,"Excellent book, I felt like I was there, like I am getting a first hand account of what life was like for blacks and whites at the time. Mrs. Keckley is an excellent writer. My only problem with the book is that it appears to end abruptly. I don't think the e-copy captures the last few pages."
2,Elozabeth Keckley's Diary,"I really had a hard time reading this. It's one of the worst diary writings I have ever read. I can understand why a publisher would think this book would be important.However, even if a book is someone as interesting as Mary Todd. Some things quiet honestly should never be published.There were a few interesting moments about Mary and Abraham Lincoln in the diary. That is really the only reason why I gave it two stars.The person who published this book. Makes it seems like there is more info on the Lincoln's then there acutely is.It's more about the hard times of slavery. I don't have a problem reading about such things. However, there are a lot better books out there written about the subject.If your really new to learning about the Civil War, slavery, and the Lincoln family. Then this book would be relatively of help to you.But for any long time Civil War book. skip this."
5,a good basic meter,If you are just entering the ranks of amateur radio and need a basic SWR meter to get started then this is for you.

1,A COMMERCIAL POSING AS HISTORY,"Reagan had no revolutionary visions, he had reactionary visions. His ideas are not looking forward,to some great hill of freedom. They're looking backward to a utopian past that never existed. He believed that the MacCarthy Hearings, which he was instrumental in organizing, were a good thing. He thought that confronting the Soviet Union at every turn was a peaceful solution. He took credit for things he didn't do, like knocking down the Berlin Wall and he never heard of Iran-Contra or the deficit. If you love Reagan and you enjoy feel good, ""Leave it to Beaver"" history you'll love this book. If you prefer research......look elsewhere."
5,The Bucket is God,"Great. Bootsy, Brain, Bernie, and Buckethead make this perhaps the best album ever. Funky bass lines, ripping guitar, awesome beats and crazy boardwork make this a must have. Get anything of Bucketheads you can get your hands on."
4,It's great.... and it stinks!,"Take a bunch of fantastic and accomplished musicians, put them together in the studio and you're GUARANTEED to have a hit band with hit songs........ uh, NO! Although I can say nothing regarding the musicianship (hell, they ought to teach a class based on the playing on this album), one thing is certain: the songs themselves lack feeling, hooks or anything remarkable. The playing, particularly the guitar, is unparalleled and I often whip this CD out when a guitarist is visiting so I can watch his jaw drop. Bootsy also brings us some cool 'space bass' in spots. This is hybrid music, a little metal, a little urban, a little experiemental. It's actually a shot in the dark musically, as the songs themselves seriously lack charachter and emotion, yet a blistering performance exhibited within. Most likely will only be truly appreciated by musicians, esp. sweep-picking-hammer-on guitarists or any fans of the Collins/Worrell combo. 5-star performance, 1-star songs."
3,Its OK,"i would rather give this puppy about 2.5 stars but the options are limited. kind of a neat album in its own way but also fairly repetative. that is the bad thing about buckethead, when you hear one song, you have basically heard them all. there are some highlights on this album, a few really well thought out solos, but overall this is the same as everything else he has done, with the exception of colma, which is an incredible album. its not nearly as mind opening as some other reviews make it out to be, its accually fairly cheesy, the changes are in the vein of mr. bungle or naked city, but not nearly as cool. the drum beats are stagnent, basically never change in the whole songs. I am a huge fan of monster guitar playing, this guys is a nut, but not exactly my cup of tea. maybe its yours. i wish i didn't buy it."
2,IT DON'T TAKE MUCH TO PLEASE SOME FOLKS...,"I HATE TO BURST ALL YALL'S BUBBLES, BUT I WAS NOT REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THIS ONE. GRANTED, I GIVE IT CREDIT FOR BEING EXPERIMENTAL AND I ADMIT THERE IS SOME FINE MUSICIANSHIP TO BE HEARD, BUT TURNTABLE SCRATCHING AND CHEAP SAMPLING RUIN ANY ATTEMPT OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSION. THERE ARE SOME PARTS THAT I LIKE, BUT MOST OF THIS DISK IS UTTER RUBBISH.... THE COMPOSITIONS ARE WEAK, THE SCANT VOCALS..., THE SOUND IS CHEESY, AND MOST OF THE MATERIAL IS NEITHER INSPIRED NORCREATIVE.... IF YOU WANT POOR, HEAVILY - SYNTHHESIZED MUSIC FURTHER RUINED BY STUDIO GADGETRY, THIS IS FOR YOU. BUCKETHEAD IS HOWEVER AN EXCELLENT GUITARIST, BUT HE NEEDS TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A GUITAR INSTEAD OF A POWERDRILL."
2,It didn't impress me!,"Julio has some great Spanish songs that I always love to listen to.This CD didn't really impress me much as it's mostly work of other singers.Also as a peronsol preference, I like to hear Julio singing Spanish or even French but not English!So, this CD was not for me!"
3,Rerun,I wish there were more original songs on this CD. Half of it is from other people. But the half that is from J.I is great.
5,Julio Iglesias CD,"CD was in great shape when arrived. It was given to my Mom for her 84th birthday. She loved it and said the songs were great. Was shipped very prompltly and on time for her b-day! I also like Julio's singing, so I purchased this same CD later. Will definitely order from this seller again."
5,"Julio Iglesias ""Love Songs""","When I listen to Julio sing, I just melt.This CD is so beautiful I can't help butplay it again and again. SUPER!!!"
5,Dreamy,I love his voice and choice of music.....prefect for listening by yourself or for a romantic evening........very enjoyable music.....
4,Not bad...,This game is pretty good and you should get it since its only about $...dollars.WWE RAW and this game are the only wrestling game for PC so you should get both.Both RAW and Nitro you can add wrestler like what one of the reviewers said.thank him for that website.this game is worth buying it and raw and nitro together cost only about $...You should get both of these games because they are very fun...
4,Nitro- The Best Wristling Game For PC's,"Well I have played this game a lot, so that should tell you that it is not a boring game. And also the game has all the best wristlers in it and you could choose any one pluce you could enter chat coades and the game is the coolest game on earth.I hope you people buy the game and hav fun."
5,"Jazzy, Mellow, Funky","This album is jazzy , mellow, and funky often all in the same song. Several tunes will make you want get up and dance. Marc Moulin uses a variety of electronic keyboards and mainly downtempo grooves. There is some very soulful organ playing especially on ""FTB"". The vocal songs are cool jazzy numbers by Christa Jerome. His sidemen are obviously serious straight ahead players. There is some very nice muted trumpet ala Miles Davis on ""Le bruit de l'ombre"" and ""Paris"". Long time friend Phillip Catherine adds some very nice guitar. I was blown away when I heard this CD and immediately went out and got his other two Blue Note releases that are also great. Today I started searching to see if he had released anything new or if anything was on the horizon only to find that he had died from throat cancer at age 66 in November of 2008. What a loss! This guy had a great musical mind."
5,A big improvement over last year's design,"Last year I wrote a review on the Stardate calendar and complained about how small the dates were and how the entire calendar focussed more on the terrible ""Enterprise"" series rather than the Star Trek franchise as a whole. Last year's calendar didn't even include any images from any of the TEN feature films.I am proud to say that this year's calendar is a marked improvement over last year's! The dates are larger and in a bolder font. All five series are represented and all ten films are included as well. The pictures are indeed small compared to previous releases as mentioned by another reviewer, but the variety of images this year makes up for the lack of size.Highly recommended to any true Trek fan who understands it is a STAR TREK calendar...not a year-long publicity photo shoot for an inferior ""Enterprise"" series."
4,The Witch has an Itch,A very cute halloween story about a witch changing her evil ways. Fun read for halloween!
4,Very effective if you are disciplined,"This book provides a simple, straight-forward method for strengthening your abdonminal muscles and eliminating a ""gut"". If you follow the instructions, it works. It does require discipline, especially at first. After the first 12 weeks, it becomes much easier to maintain."
4,Very good start on abdominal excercise.,"Good book for its day, which has been superseded by a book on a different level: ""The Complete Book of Abs"" by Kurt Brungard."
5,What more do you need? Yoga-Booty-Ballet! lol,"My mother bought this workout video when it first hit the market, and she opened it, tryed it once, hated it and gave it to me. I let a ""friend"" ""borrow"" it and I never seen it from them again!, So I was ecstatic when I found out that amazon sold it, Now I love it for many reasons: 1.)It worked for me, I was in great shape while doing it! now everyone is different so I wont garuntee it'll work for everyone but, 2.)The price is worth trying it if your into this kinda workout. 3.) Its so upbeat and encouraging! I also like that they trainers feel like real people, they mess up now and then, they make funny noises, and they get so fired up, I love it!Now the reason my mom hated it and the only small teeny dislike of mine is they dont breakdown move by move they kinda say it and do it and u have to try and keep up!"
3,So-so,"The warm up did not really warm me up for cardio. Maybe if it was my pilates/yoga day, sure, but not for cardio. The dance section was pretty good. But oh man, the blonde instructor was pretty annoying. She kept sticking her tongue out - STOP! Otherwise I like their energy overall. I just wish the warm up was an actual warm up for cardio and the blonde instructor kept her tongue in."
2,Shrinking Sweatshirt,Do not buy this sweatshirt if it is really for a tall person. I was upset because this was a gift and Amazon said I would have it before Christmas which I didn't. but when I got it I was so glad it was late. The arms are so short and it shrunk so much when I washed it. I would have been embarrassed if I would have given as my gift.
1,horrible quality and sizing,"I'm 6'3"" and a big guy so i ordered my pullover hoodie in 4x tall. When it came it was paper thin and the sleeves stop above my wrist. the Gildan hoodies are half the price and better quality. so much for trying to buy a better named product. never again"
2,Not quite right,"The size was okay, not as big as I hoped for and the neck opening was too small. My husband cut the opening to create more room. I'll know better next time."
1,NOT zip front,"Beware, this item is NOT a zip front hoodie as the item description says. It is a pullover!"
1,Too small,It was too small and instead of returning kept it for my husband still a little snug and too short.
1,NOT LONG ENOUGH,IT OK BUT ITS NOT LONG ENOUGH I WOULDNT PREFER THIS TO NO ONE EVEN 360 AROUND THE WORLD HA
4,Good bu not great,Bought these because I thought Hillfiger had a quality name. Find that these wear great for a few months but then start to seperate at the seams. For between $14.00 and $18.00 per pair they should last longer.My Hanes for $8.00 per pair outlast these 3 to 1.
2,Pricey,"My wife got these for me and I said never again. When ordering, she thought they came two pair per box but they didn't. These are a nice product, but you can find them cheaper at retail shops."
5,Durango Simply The Best And Thats The Bottom Line.,"The Durango Mens Engineer Harness boot is another fine looking boot from the leader in the boot industry.I have had many different brands of boots in my lifetime and Durango has been a proven winner time after time.From the first pair as a kid to the numerous pair I have now.If you are looking for a dress,work,or just a boot to play around in,Durango has the boot for you.The Bottom Line Is Durango Is Simply The Best."
4,For fans of modern minimal classical music.,read the title for this review. that basically sums it up. modern. minimal. classical. sparse and droning in parts. highly tense and melodic in other parts. a few minor electric nuances here and there. fans of max richter would probably enjoy this album. if you liked johannsson's other albums you'll probably like this one too. this album gets a 4.5 out of 5 stars from me (and not just 4). recommended.
2,Not enough,"A friend recommended this to me, but it's way too middle of the road. I'll put it on shuffle for the background music I listen to while at the office, where I don't want music that draws attention to itself or makes me think. Wouldn't really recommend. Theres not much that makes this special or memorable."
3,$900 is now overpriced,"Since the release of the DIGI 003, this unit will soon be un-supported by digidesign within the next year or so. I find it hard to believe some people are trying to sell used units for over $900 when Guitar Center has it for $799 at this point (and it will go lower). With Digidesign's trade-up program, you can get a NEW DIGI 003 for $799 with a 001 trade in. This is a great unit, unfortunately, just soon to be obsolete."
1,SOFT PORN,I ONLY WATCHED 20 MINUTES OF THIS MOVIE.IT'S ALL NUDITY AND SEX.I EXPECTED SOME BASED ON THE COVER-BUT IT'S ALL NUDITY AND SEX.
1,Who gave this 5 stars?,"If you gave this film more than one star you're obviously easy to please.What sort of person buys this sort of film? Someone who wants to see soft-core. So, if soft-core's your game, then forget this as it's a yawn. It fails terribly with boring sex scenes that were conceived by someone with limited imagination."
3,Would-be Philosopher Snubs Philosophy,"Smolin's book is fascinating reading because it integrates so many diverse topics: physics, philosophy, art, mathematics. It also advances a very interesting thesis, namely, that laws of nature evolve. The main problem with the book, however, is that it only gives passing reference to the many philosophers who have already advanced such a thesis and in greater detail than Smolin (Peirce, James, Dewey, Whitehead). It is as if Smolin wishes to create ideas out of thin air, instead of drawing on the work of the past. At best, such an approach is bad scholarship; at worst, I fear, it is a kind of arrogance unique to physicists, here operating once more to confuse popular culture, what I call WORLD-mongering, or the mistaken belief that only one class of intellectuals (physicists) can single-handedly explain it all."
1,This book is not for physicists,"As I said this is NOT for physicists. And ""Cosmological Natural Selection"" is nothing but a junk. There is so much philosophy in this book. Well, I didn't like it."
4,nice watch,"nice watch looks great runs well, the only problem with this purchase, was that the instruction manuel was missing there is a slab under the watch box where it usually goes giving info on the watch, it was missing."
3,Fancy flights,"Diversifying things by employing three distinct units, Lovano's second trio treatment can be a little more interestingly vibrant this time around, but with too much downtime focused on pretentious duetting, evens out again to only a fairly good release."
2,Misstep,"No question that Lovano is a major contemporary figure, he's earned that through a series of marvelous records. This is a major disappointment though, nothing at all like the superb Trio Fascination Vol. 1. The problem lies in the conception - the various ensembles deny the CD any focus whatsoever, the number of tracks with each group means that there is no room [time] for a good exploration of the best parts, and the personnel choices are not ideal. One would expect Lovano and Dave Douglas to combust, but they play past each other, Billy Drewes is as thin-sounding and meaningless as usual, and Joe himself plays drums on several tracks, in order to provide the proper instrumentation within the guidelines of a trio, and Joe is simply not good at it. Skip it, especially if you're a fan."
3,Featuring: six good tracks for the price of 14!!,"Nearly everything that Joe Lovano is involved in is amazing, creative, and always manifests an integrity that stays with the listener for a long time. Most of the tracks on this album follow this same wonderful pattern.I am not an authority on the technical aspects nor the history of the harmonica, but Toots, while obviously a great musician, was quite frankly miscast on this album. The tracks with Toots could be better heard as duo fascinations.A Lovano/Douglas collaboration has been much anticipated and does not fail to deliver. Judging by the uncertainty heard on the melodies, it seems that this was one of the first and perhaps only times they had played together.Of particular delight was the astounding improvement in Lovano's alto tone. The whine in the upper register has been replaced by warmth and roundness of sound.I recommend this album with reservation, it's like buying half of a great album."
2,I dont like it,I realize this agin is my mistake - but ----- I assumed I was getting the catholic one year bible. instead i got the verse a day or what ever haven't looked at it lately. I don't know if there is anything I can so about this but I again assumed I was getting what was pictured.
3,Buyer Beware,"Lauro Martines is a socialistic historian. His works hold to the Marxist ""class warfare"" theory of history and Loredana is a variation on this theme. It features explicit sexual scenes, what Martines see's as the oppression of women and of the ""proletariat"" by evil, white, upper class, Venetian males. I'm not panning the book, if you are coming from this point of view or if you enjoy these themes, then this might be the book for you. However, I do think that buyers should be aware of this philosophical background before purchasing."
3,My original review was lost/removed.,"This PC would be nice to have only if SONY tested it more than just for basic functionality, a lot of problems out of a box. I'm still running it since July 2007 (for 5 months) and yes it would fo it job of being media PC and recording basic TV. Vista is the worst part of this PC. No wounder Dell allowed it customers to return to Win XP pro - make me think even MSoft and Dell agreed on Vista - not ready for general public even as of now December 2007. May be after Vista SP1( Feb-March 2008) this Sony PC will work the way it should be. From design stand point very well build media PC - best on a market for price/design/look/size. I would think that SOny will improve with new updates/patches within next 3-4 months."
3,Choir arrangements.,"I was searching for the title song, ""Love Crucified Arose"" and found this book arranged for choir. Beautiful arrangements."
1,out of stock,I ordered this for my grandson and was very disappointed to see it still listed for sale although I was told it was out of stock.Amazon...get on the ball.
5,Effective,I have to have this book for a Marriage and Family class in school. So far my book as done its job and I am interested in the material it holds.
5,One of the greatest books that I have ever read,It presents the intensive details about fundamental and technical part of trading and it provides many inside knowledge about futures markets which you cannot easily get from other books.
4,A Complete Guide to the Futures Markets,"This book is a must read for anyone interested in starting a trading business. While it is an old book it provides an excellent and objective look at the different methods of analysis (Technical and Fundamental.) The emphasis is on the futures market. In my view it provides and excellent introduction to this market but, I find the techniques applicable to stocks and currencies.I only wish I had discovered this book 15 years before."
4,"Nice Book, Jack, but I need a PhD in Math...","It's a nice book, Jack, but you need a PhD in Math to appreciate it. I've only read part 4, the part on charting, technical analysis and trading systems. I thought that section was well done. I've only skimmed through the rest of the book."
5,Bulk for cooks!,"Works perfectly with the dispenser, good to get in bulk for anyone making volumes of whipped cream, great price, all perfectly functioning cartridges not a single dud."
3,Yuck,"These work, they do the job as intended, but they leave a strong metallic taste in your mouth you don't get with some other brands."
1,low quality,Out of the fifty cartriges only about twenty worked. The gas gave the cream a bad taste and the part of the cartridge that gets punctured were mostly crooked and off center which caused me to get frost bite from the gas spraying uncontrolled and they caused my canister to get damaged the puncture tip got dulled making it more difficult to screw on more cartriges
2,Poorly named.,"Lets just say I did not buy this Item to compress whipped cream and I was very disappointed. The product is cut down very significantly and after using 2 boxes it ruined my cracker with whatever impurities are in the air they replace the good stuff with. I honestly wouldn't even want this touching my food but if you don't mind replacing your crackers over and over and that's your sole intent in buying this then have at it.Delivery was late, Product is otherwise as advertised."
1,"Gargage, crap, ennormormous waste of money",The worst purchase made ever. They do not work at all. I am disgusted that they could be sold with a clear conscience.
2,Product is good packaging is not.,"The cartridges are as advertized and work well in my Whip-It! Brand whipped cream maker. The package it arrived in however was not satisfactory. The outside box was a typical Amazon box with their big smile on the side. Inside was a much smaller box that should have contained the cartriges. There was no packing material in the Amazon box so the smaller box was loose inside and in many pieces, the 50 cartriges were loose. It would have been nice to have the smaller box to store the 50 cartriges in."
5,Hard to find,"It is so difficult to find these refills anywhere. These are good quality and so worth the price. If you have never used a whipped creamer device, do yourself a favor and buy one and stock up on these cartridges. You will never go back to fake whipped cream again!"
4,they work,Not sure how to rate a product like this having no other to compare it to. Sometimes it takes two to get the thickness in my foam that I want.
5,if this is great stuff wait till you hear the newest album!!,"this is the best band spain has produced in years.the album kicks ... in the true traditional rock way.for your information these guys have a second album called""hombre en el espejo""which is really good also,but even better they have their latest release""REAL"" which is their best achievement ever and is in full english in a unique blend of rock,a must for every good music listener!amazing to have such a great band from such a place as gibraltar!keep it up guys,i love your muzic!"
3,Great for spanish rock,Not a famous band of spanish rock but really good. If you like typical spanish rock you will like this group. They also sing 4 songs in english because they are from Gibraltar in Spain but part of England.
4,Beautiful description of the bedrock of Appalachia strength,"Appalachia has gotten a bad rap...hillbillies, poor, ignorant, etc. Those who have lived there, or know people who have, know this is false. After all, Appalachians formed the bedrock of the union movement in this country (think United Mine Workers), fought much of the Civil War, and ran our steel miils.Ms. Slone does a powerful job of exposing the powerful inner strength developed by residents of these mountains over the generations. She makes you believe that ""hillbilly"" is not an epithet, but--as she says--an adaptation of the Shakesperean Wiiliam (""Billy"") to the mountains--hence, hill billy's.A great book for anyone who wants to understand (or who already admires) this very important region in our country."
5,great book from the heart,love this as I come from the same area she wrote about and really enjoyed the memories. It is a good honest book
5,Absolutely essential guide for economic writing.,"Not only for the young economist, I would consider this is an essential guide for those preparing economic papers to submit to academic presses. Thomson's style is warm, clear and engaging, and his advice sound. Anyone who has ever gotten a headache working through the notation of a working economic theory paper will be tempted to buy the author a copy of this book. Highly recommended."
3,Very helpful but could be improved,The section on introductions and lit reviews is excellent. Referees are harsh. Start strong and don't piss them off. Thomson gives you good suggestions for making referees happy.He has pretty good advice for explaining a mathematical model though much of that is obvious.He really doesn't talk at all about how to present data either in a paper or in a talk. It is harder to do a good job presenting data that an outsider might guess.
1,Disappointing,For anyone bright enough to earn a PhD in economics this book will vastly under-deliver. The author should be embarrassed.
5,Great old Western Fun & Terrific History of the Pony Express,"Charlton Heston & Forrest Tucker play off each other very well. The good old Westerns are the best! Rhonda Flemming is a great ""set decoration"" but gives a romantic addition to the movie. The starting of the Pony Express & how it operated is a wonderful history lesson to those who don't know it even if it is by Hollywood's ""old"" standards of history! Highly recommended!"
3,Great Scenery,"Charlton Heston stars as Buffalo Bill, who along with partner Wild Bill Hickock, played by Forrest Tucker, is attempting to set up the Pony Express to help connect California with the rest of the country. Beautiful Rhonda Fleming and her brother are part of a group trying to prevent that from happening, wanting California to go it alone, rather than be part of the Union. Not only must Chuck do battle with them, but there are also the Indians to consider, not to mention the nagging presence of Jan Sterling, a tomboy in love with him. Pony Express is not short on action and that is its saving grace. The plot and dialogue are routine, the direction uninspired, and the characters comes across as sketches. The beauty of Rhonda Fleming and the technicolor scenery helps to make this acceptable viewing. There could be a great movie made about the Pony Express. This just isn't it."
3,Fun Western,"Although the characters of Buffalo Bill Cody and Wild Bill Hickox are not exactly historically correct, this old western is fun to watch. The two Bills are up against a crew of politicians/civilians who want to make California independent from the United States. Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill are a threat to their plans with their own plan to connect Sacramento with the East Coast. Fun action and adventure, but not one of Heston's best."
5,Fun Time Western,"Just an over all good western with plenty of star appeal.Great scenery.A descent transfer.Good story line.If you like a good family film,then saddle up and enjoy this western......support your favorite artists......"
3,Watchable but just short of top drawer Western,"The lightweight plot revolves around the adventures of Buffalo Bill Cody(Charlton Heston)and Wild Bill Hickok(Forrest Tucker)as they get involved in the opening up of the mail routes between California and the rest of the Union.They must also try to frustrate the plans of the devious Rance Hastings (Michael Moore )to split California from the rest of the Union.The action scenes are splendidly well done and there are a lot of them but the script ,by Charles Marquis Warren ,is too talky and frankly rather dull .However there is a lot to enjoy -some crisp colour photography ,a raft of lively peformances from the leads who include Rhonda Fleming and Jan Sterling as the women in our heroes' lives and a nice study in icy villainy from Henry BrandonThe result is a good Western that is perfectly enjoyable but which falls short of the very highest standards owing to a routine storyline and verbiose script"
4,good,When placing the order we chose the regular shipping and realized it would take longer than expected.On requesting the book seller the product delivery was made expedited(with no additional fee).which is highly appreciative. The condition of the book was as mentioned. The price the book was sold at was great. Thank you.
3,"Wanted More about the Chess, not the Issues","There was never a great champion in chess than Bobby Fischer. He was a artist over the board. His combinations, his sacrifices, and opening moves are still some of the most popular attractions. In later years, Bobby has developed a mental illness that has caused serious damage to his reputation and to the world. This book, I was hoping, would deal with his background, mostly his chess career. It disappointed me because the book was really a T.V. documentary, and much of the book was interviews with various people who have come across in Bobby's life. I wanted to learn about this amazing talent, not so much about his off-the-wall comments over the years. I feel for Bobby, he is sick, and died recently a paranoid man. At 13, Bobby was beating grandmasters. He is a special talent, one in a million. This was not a great book on his background. It was mostly a book about the issues around Bobby, but not his chess."
4,Quien se ha llevado mi queso?,Este es un excelente libro para todos nosotros que vivimos en una sociedad de tantos cambios como esta. Pero lo mas importante es que nos ayuda a todos a enfrentar cualquier etapa de cambios en nuestras vidas en todas areas.
2,Didn't hold my interest.,"I like cozy mysteries and I like quilting, so a friend passed this along to me.This is part of the Queen Bees Quilt Mystery series. It may have helped if I had read the previous (introductory) book, but I had a hard time getting through it. I wasn't really compelled by the story or the characters. The mystery wasn't very intricate and I had it figured out long before the 'mystery solving quilters' did.I'd rather read the Benni Harper series by Earlene Fowler for a quilt themed mystery."
4,Humanizing Those Evangelicals,"Christianity and Southern culture are clearly seen in this novel. Whether inside or outside of the church, we see what George Rosencranz and his wife, Susan go through. One has an opportunity to see Susan confront Eileen, the mistress in a counseling session. It is emphasized that no mortal human being is perfect and that the Rosencrazes need the help of Jesus Christ to overcome the aftermath of the adulterous relationship. Also, the reader becomes very familiar with the city of Houston, as both real and fictitious geographical references are given."
1,Don't buy this movie!,This movie does not tell the true story of who actually found and unearthed this dinosaur. It's full of lies and deception. I wouldn't give this movie away for free.
4,YES YES YES,"Other reviews have trashed this book but don't explain why. It's a fascinating collection of cell phone conversations recorded illegally over a period of about 5 years. The slightly edited transcripts go a long way to showing how strange, and yet how human, the world is around us. Drugs, sex and relationships predominate. Some of the stories are pretty frightening, but all of it provides a great document about who our neighbors are, what they're doing, thinking and talking about when they're not being observed. Definitely not for the easily offended, but more than worth your time to read."
3,Voyeurism of another kind...,"I first picked up this book in a store about three years ago; I found it intriguing, the Spacewurm intercepting calls and taking down the gory details.Some of the calls were funny, while others were a bit disturbing. What they do is show people as they are, no different than any of us.The argument between Tracy and Richard is a good example; a broken relationship, with recriminations that many can identify with.While the legality of picking off cell calls puts him in a gray area, it doesn't seem to have gotten the Wurm in trouble (yet). Not a great work of art by any stretch of the imagination, but a cautionary tale: be careful what you say on your cellphone!"
2,Forgettable remix album,"I love Icon of Coil's first album (Serenity is the Devil), but felt they declined a bit with each album. What I like about them is they generally supply driving EBM with clean vocals. This is a remix album comprised of mixes of tracks from their first 2 albums. Unfortunately, only 2 or 3 of the 12 remixes are any good, the rest generally lack in creativity or talent. Also, the 2 new tracks are pretty worthless."
5,Too beautiful for words,"When I was pregnant with my son I would lay with my belly next to this beautiful music. When he was a small child and I was playing this in the car he commented how he liked it, which he never did to my other music. Also, Autumn is my first experience with George Winston. This is clearly my favorite of all his music. The flowing quality is trance-like and too lovely to explain in words."
5,Good deal,I have been listening to an old worn out cassette tape of this album for years. I grew up listening to the record of it with all the crackles and pops. It is nice to finally have a good recording. I love it.
5,George Winstons Autumn CD,We used this CD in raffled basket titled Autumn Romance. It was one of the featured items. It is a colorful and relaxing CD. Someone from our group bought one to use for massage background music. A must for any CD library.
4,Great album for an October drive,"Driving through the New England countryside in October, checking out the panorama of leaves, looking for a produce stand selling fresh apples and cider, these are the kinds of visual images you get while listening to George Winston's ""Autumn."" The songs are for the most part long and meandering, with George taking his piano in whatever direction suits him throughout a song. What he's aiming for is superior mood muusic, and in this he succeeds. Though not as good as ""Summer,"" released more than a decade later with stronger song content, this is still one of Winston's best albums."
4,Autumn by George Winston,"Not as interesting to listen to as some of his other CD's, such as December or Forest but good nonetheless."
4,Good,"Not as good as ""December"" by a long shot, but it is a good effort. Winston would be interesting to see in concert. I wonder if there are any video concert videos/DVD's out there."
5,Relaxing,"I used to listen to this music from George Winston in college, twenty-some years ago, and loved it. I was driving down the freeway about a month ago, hear one of the pieces from this album and though, ""I remember this......and I miss it!"" Knowing that I only had it on cassette tape, in a box that was who knows where, I went home and ordered it. It shipped as expected and received it in just a couple of days. I LOVE THIS CD!"
4,Good piano listening,"Very well done. Not as slow and relaxing as some, but nice piano for background listening.Worth the purchase.All of the seasons are good listening."
3,luminous Shirley MacLaine,"LOVING COUPLES is a cute little romantic comedy which is only noteworthy for it's quartet of stars (Shirley MacLaine, James Coburn, Susan Sarandon and Stephen Collins). It has a lovely musical score and a great supporting performance from Sally Kellerman as the seductive Mrs Liggett.The plot is thin. Shirley MacLaine plays the vivacious wife of a doctor (James Coburn) who falls in love with a real-estate agent (Stephen Collins). MacLaine's husband then proceeds to have an affair with the girlfriend of Collins (Susan Sarandon).Enjoyable fluff, elevated by it's stars, especially luminous Shirley MacLaine."
3,Loving Couples,This is an oldie but a goodie! The type of movie that is light and fun - I saw it years ago and just loved watching it again
3,Loving Couples Keep on Loving,"I think that Loving Couples was great especially b/c of the great and talented Stephen Collins who plays Greg. It was terrific movie along with other actors I never heard of, but if you are a love addict this move will get you every time."
5,Lincoln the Unknown,"After years of fascination and research on Abe Lincoln, this is a knock dead, little known fact book that is so interesting that you cannot put it down! It was such an incredibley good read that I purchased a copy for my son! A +++++++++"
4,A Insightful and Inspirational BooK!,"The book is all about the life and struggles of Abe Lincoln, on how he led a life of poverty to presidency. The book goes into not the history of the time but the relationships he created to the common everyday person he dealt with. I read the book and just devoured it. For people many times just see the person and not the struggles that created that persona for who we know and well loved."
5,Lincoln the unknown,Best book I have ever read on Pres. Lincoln.You can walk away feeling like you knew the manpersonally. His life makes you grateful for the oneyou have!
1,Horrible product,"I didn't expect this to be a high quality dart board but I did expect it to work. No matter how hard or soft you throw a dart, when it hits the board it drags down at least 3 inches. This is a horrible product and it is not usable in the least bit. Don't waste your money. Spend an extra $10 and get a real magnetic dart board if you still want a cheap one."
5,Impressive,"I am a big Lego fan and I think this is one of their better sets. Big and technically interesting, the crane is, like all tower cranes, an engineering masterpiece. I was able to pick up this set at the Lego site for $49.98."
4,Venom fans will like this one,"Two Champions of Shaolin combines some great elements: four of the six Venoms, lots of action and a variety of weapons. The combination makes for an enjoyable kunf fu movie. The plot is basically shaolin vs. wu tan. As usual for the Venom flims, Lu Feng plays the major villain and does not disappoint. Lo Meng plays the protagonist with support from Sun Chien and Chiang Sheng. Some other faces appear to round out a great cast and a somewhat interesting plot (for a kung fu film). Two Champions of Shaolin delivers lots of action and great fight scenes. Venom fans should enjoy this one. The only major thing missing from this film is Philip Kwok."
1,it is not the item I ordered,"good morningI would l ike to know what exactly is all parts of this item, i just received one rule in the picture it is shown all parts belons to this full item, it is possible i can to change this by one full paper shopi ll be looking forward to your responseregards"
1,To short,"The cover was too short , too narrow and not tall enough for a 2009 SeaDoo RXP 155. The cover was well made. They should list the messurments of the item."
3,Michael Cook in fine form,"An interesting and original semi-biography. If you want a chronological description of his life, then this is not for you. But if you are interested in an original perspective, check out this small book."
3,"a concise introduction to Muhammad's life, religion and politics","This is a very short book that could be read in one seat, yet it contains substantial information about Muhammad's life, teachings and politics. Michael Cook draws both from traditional Muslim sources (such as the ""Sira"" of Ibn Ishaq and, obviously, the Koran) and from modern criticism.I particularly enjoyed Chapter 2, a concise presentation of the traditional account of Muhammad's life, as opposed to other chapters where the author attempts to question the historical reliability of the traditional sources."
5,As thrilling now as it ever was!!!,If you're a JUDY fan (and who isn't?) this is the CD you MUST have. Her voice is at it's best on every song. Fabulous back up band. You will listen to this for years to come.
3,Good Example of Judy,"This is a great group of performances by Garland. However, the audience in the background is annoying at times. Some tunes are much different that later in her life. All in all I enjoyed this album."
2,Not as exciting as I thought it whould be.,This recording made live at Carnegie Hall is just not as exciting as I thought it would be. It's great material. Judy is at the height of her powers. The band is outstanding. The audience adores her. And yet....We do have the studio recordings and some other live recordings.Our Judy is eternal!
2,"OK for rabid fans, but everyone else beware!","This historic event in Garland's career is a must have for rabid fans, but these CDs do not feature Garland's voice at its best. I felt embarrassed for her just listening to her voice fail to hit the right notes on so many songs, not to mention she sounds very raspy throughout. The last four or five songs are the best (she had over an hour to warm up, I guess). After hearing all the hype, I really wanted to buy the gold edition when it came out some months ago. The $40 or so seemed too steep for me, until I recently received a gift certificate to Tower Records. : ) I wish I had spent the money on something else -- even a better recording (or two at this price!) of Garland taped in studio. Casual buyers beware!"
5,Still the Greatest!!!,"As I write this review, exactly 40 years have passed since Judy packed Carnegie Hall to the rafters. I own the LP version of this magnificent concert and I must say that anyone who has never heard of this great artist should make this CD the perfect introduction. BRAVO!!!"
1,By far the best album on the planet Earth,The one star rating is just to get your attention. I am a 25-year-old straight male who loves good music. This recording is Mount Everest for the music world. I don't know what else to say about it. It is the limit. And the quality of this newly remastered release it unparalleled.
2,"Held my breath, waiting for this recording and still waiting","I'm sorry but this stuff is boring. The orchestration, songs, tempo and pacing is so fifties it's madding. It's 1961 but Judy's voice had allot of vibrato and had lowered in range and register by then.As she was at the 40 year old mark it's understandable (passing at 47). It didn't help adding in the drugs and physical problems.Much better recordings are the `The Capital Recordings' 1955-1965, her pipes were working well and she was sounding sensational in this time and environment."
5,Absolutely the best,"Judy At Carnegie Hall is without a doubt the finest live recording by a female artist in the 20th century, period. Other singers have had their ""live"" recordings, too, but they cannot compete with Miss Garland on this night. (I swear, every ""live"" recording by other [female] artists, try to duplicate the success of this evening). She starts off strong and stays that way, taking the lucky audience - and us lucky listeners - with her as she wraps her talent around 26 songs. Today's stars, and I use that word lightly, could take a tip from Miss Garland. Today's singers seem to need all kinds of technical and lighting props, etc. Miss Garland had herself and an orchestra. Who could ask for anything more? She is playful and winning and heartbroken and wistful and even sensual (""Do It Again""). It's all here. And it's all brilliant. A must for any CD library."
5,A Total Classic,You will never hear a more thrilling live album by arguably the greatest singer of the twentieth century at her absolute peak. If you don't buy this right now it's your sorry loss.
5,Judy Live with Love,"Judy Garland, as a legendary performer, is perhaps best known for her bravura, brass and larger than life delivery. In this collection, recorded live at Carnegie Hall, you will witness both that soaring voice as well as the tender lilt of ballads, notably ""You're Nearer"" and Noel Coward's ""If Love Were All"". It is so difficult to describe, like the pleasing taste of food-- a quality in her singing style at once pure and polished and at the same time honest and raw (the incredible ""Stormy Weather""). It is all feeling, color, and mood. How can anyone just like her? This invites only love. A must for any collector."
4,Marvelous,"Judy Garland's five time Grammy-winning LIVE record (Judy at Carnegie Hall) is a celebration of a magnificent talent. Each song sparkles as Garland's trademark throaty vocals soar to each note as if effortless. Definitely essential, definitely worth it, definitely Judy."
5,Judy's greatest concert triumph to be re-lived over & over!,"Judy Garland was undoubtedly the greatest entertainer of her time, probably of all time. This Carnegie Hall concert was a triumphant comeback for her, and thank goodness Capitol Records recorded it. It became a best selling LP and won many awards, and now it's back in a stunning remastered edition. A must-have for any fan of great American music.My one quibble (and a major one): Why the moronic additional liner notes? So poorly written, they read like a bad elementary school book report. I guess any obsessed fan can pass him or herself off as a professional writer to clueless record label employees nowadays. A terrible insult to the presentation of one of the all-time classic albums in the history of recorded music. Surely they could have gotten someone else to cast a little well-written perspective on this great classic recording. Judy deserves better and so does the buying public. Shame on you, Capitol!"
2,An original take on fighting games.,"This is a Mortal Kombat clone, with huge amounts of blood, and two fatalities for each competitor. The only difference with this game is that all of the fighters are pre-historic! Two apes, a big dinosaur, a fire breathing legendary dinosaur, a raptor and much more. The gameplay is much like Street Fighter 2, and the gameplay is very slow, because you are fighting as dinosaurs! Another interesting feature is that for those who like to use the same move over and over again, the game laughs at you. Pretty cheap game, rent it before you buy it."
3,Best home console version but still bad,This was far better than the genisis mess version but the controls are still too complicated and the gameplay sucks.
2,Review,"The 'wallchart' is extremely helpful. It list all the inputs/tools and techniques/outputs for each of the component processes. Great study tool. However, have found omissions and incorrect data in the book. I haven't taken the exam yet, but comparing the questions in this book to the PMP Study Guide by Kim Heldman, these questions seem extremely tricky. I hope the PMP test questions are a little more straight forward. Besides the 'wallchart', I prefer the book by Kim Heldman."
3,Maybe I am a dummy,"I figured this book would be a good companion to the PMBOK, but it is a little dated (for previous exam) and there are some glaring errors and omissions in the text that made it hard to follow. I guess I was looking for lots of helpful hints, found only a few. The chapter tests are OK (one did not actually give the answers) so this gets a 3 out of 5."
2,Not PMBOK 3rd Ed Aligned,"I bought this book last year when I started studying for the PMP. Buyer beware that this book is not based on the most recent PMBOK version and some of the information is incorrect. This book is OK for getting an idea of what the test may be like and the information covered, but it should not be used as an authoritative source of information. I even question if the the practice tests can be trusted since I have already found some of the answers to be wrong. At a minimum, get the latest PMBOK as well so you can see where there are differences."
1,Don't be a Dummy - don't buy this book,I used several high qulity PM books to study for the PMP exam.I thought this book would be helpful - especially the CD ROM for test practiceIt was a complete waste of money - the information was weak and the cd was uselessHighly recommend the Heldman and Mulchay books they are the gold standard for passing this test the first timePS - this is a serious exam - you need to know the PMBOK cold - don't waste your time on this book
5,I passed with an 89% thanks to this book!,"I have just passed the exam thanks to this book. I used this as well as the PMBOK Guide and other study material.This simple review refreshed my knowledge on project management - along with my on the job real world experience - was all that I needed. I didn;t need an intro course to PM, but a refresher, a quick easy-to-read guide that would give me insights to passing the exam. It did the trick"
3,Not the best,I've read a few of these PMP books and this one is just so so. The book by Andy Crowe is the one for you if you want to pass the exam. It is much easier to read.
1,Not a good reference,Unfortunately I purchased the book when it was released and never had an opportunity to review references. The book has many many mistakes and is not very engaging - I like the structure of the chapters but compared to other references it fall far short - it was a boring read.
1,too many errors for me,"As the other reviewers have stated there are multiple errors in this book. I purchased this book based on the reputation of the other ""For Dummies"" books. I really wished I had read the reviews prior to my purchase. In my opinion, it is really difficult to have confidence in something that is supposed to help you prepare for a test when there are so many errors. I would not waste my time purchasing this book."
2,Too many errors,"I initially thought this book would be pretty good - and I liked the MS Project exam preparation plan on the CD. However, as I got farther along in the book, I began to notice errors in the text as well as in answers given to questions - even in the math problems. I also found an error on the highly-touted 'wall chart' from the author's web site, where in the Schedule Development process, there are two extra process inputs listed. I ended up switching to the Kim Heldman book - which I'm finding to be much better. This Dummies book was a disappointment - and not very professional."
2,Don't Let This Be Your Main Squeeze!,"I was hoping to bring something fresh to the reviews, but it looks like others picked up on the errors I found too. I would DEFINITELY not recommend this book if it is the only source you are planning to use. I actually found it helpful because I would find what I thought was a contradiction, a wrong formula or chart and check it out and sure enough, it was! I'll admit this helped me learn it, but for crying out loud! Don't be a Dummy and get this book! Use Rita's."
2,Too many mistakes in the practice exam,"I bought this book to help facilitate a review course and found the practice exam at the back was loaded with mistakes on the formula-based questions. Not only typos, but just plain getting the concepts wrong (e.g., trying to calculate based on 1/2 of a standard deviation).I strongly recommend Rita Mulcahy's PMP Exam Prep instead: More expensive but very readable with good review questions.Another option is PMP Exam Cram 2, by David Frnacis and Greg Hornie."
2,There are better books available for your time and money,"The author tried to write this book with a ""lighter side"" style and with more ""test taking"" strategies than some of the more well established study guides. A good attempt, especially concidering how dry the material can be. But if you are stuggling with how to spend your time and money preparing, I suggest strongly the following:1) PMP: Project Management Professional Study Guideby Kim Heldman2) PMP Exam Prep (4th Edition)by Rita MulcahyAfter you've completed these two ""must reads"", you may want to add PMP Certificatoin for Dummies by Gerald Everett Jones as a third pass at the information. But I'm afraid that this publicaiton only fills that limited role.Get to work on the ""must reads"" and good luck with the exam.R.T."
2,Too old to be useful,"The version I was mailed was very dated. It was so dated as to be unhelpful. I ended up having to buy other materials. If you are going to buy one of these books, please don't just check the PMBOK version it is based on, check the copyright date of the Dummies book, as well."
1,Outdated,"This product is outdated. It is a review of the PMBOK, but not the current version. Very quickly into it I discovered that it wasn't current and could cause me to fail the test if I studied from that. I sent it back."
1,Did anyone else happen to notice...,"One small but significant error that abetted my loss of confidence: The CD-ROM title screen reads ""for Dumies."" What the heck is a Dumie?"
1,Would Not Recommend It,"Bought the book. The concept seemed like what I was looking for. Initially I thought this was going to be really good. After discovering some inaccuracies, mis-spells etc. I lost confidence in the material. Preparing for an exam like this you need to know that your time is well spent. Not trusting your study material is obviously not a good thing. Also, wrote to the author for some clarification. Never heard from him. I would not recommend this book to the prospective PMP."
1,Agree with the rest,"I'm going to have to agree with the rest of the comments here. This book was not worth the money. There were so many inconsistencies and just plain wrong information throughout the book, it was pathetic. Actually noticing and finding the right answers to some of the issues may have helped me pass the exam. By the end of the book, I was highlighting all the problems because I knew the material so well. Thank God I used Kim's PMP Study Guide as my must read first or I would have been in trouble!!"
4,Competent and entertaining,"The conceit of the Four Lords of the Diamond Series is that the Earth (and corresponding colonies) are ruled by a society which has everything regimented and controlled. Malcontents and criminals are sent to a planetary system infested by a virus which has different forms on each of the four planets, but which has in common on all that you cannot live without the virus in your system once you have been exposed.In this second book, an agent is sent to assassinate the Lord of the second planet, Cerberus. On Cerberus, you can change bodies with others at will.Like virtually every other Chalker book and series, the Four Lords series is concerned with issues of gender, sexuality and identity. In this book it is not irritating nor distracting from the plot. This is one of Chalker's better outings, I believe."
2,Very disappointing,"I've tried several recipes out of this book and have been very disappointed with the results. The 'Broccoli and almond quiche' is very oily and doesn't taste that great. The 'Lentil loaf' is just awful. The 'Couscous with chickpea stew' is okay, but doesn't give enough reason to buy this book.This book contains a lot of oily, deep-fry, margarine and sugar recipes. The writer is from the UK and the dishes remind me of some vegan food I tasted when I was over there.I hate to say anything negative about a vegan book (I'm a vegan myself), but this book just isn't good advertisement for veganism in my opinion."
2,GREAT CONTENT-BAD FORMAT,The content was excellent but the artist moved to fast. Without any written documention it was difficult to retain the information without constantling pausing the dvd to write notes. The dvd also lacked a logical menu and smooth access to chapters.
4,A very equilibrate performance,"On this CD, the Quartet Sine Nomine tackles one Schubert's chamber masterpiece, String Quartets Nos. 15 & No. 7. These performers, by this CD, steps into an elite group of Schubert's interpreters. They presents their own reading of this cornerstone work creating for new perfomers generation, equally powerful and equilibrate."
2,Learn it is a waste of money,"As with all Barbie toys this comes with a million little pieces. Definitely not something that you want if you have younger children in the house.This toy is absolutely a waste of money. It is cheaply made. The ""chalk board"" comes apart constantly, the piece of cardboard that goes in it constantly comes out and gets trampled on or torn up.There are many pieces to this toy that get lost in the carpet or stepped on.This toy is very cheaply made."
4,Brings Back Memories of Pre-school,This is fun for all Kelly lovers out there. I bought it to create a display for some of the Kelly Club dolls in my collection. I love the mini play kitchen set and all the little plants. There are quite a few small pieces so younger children may need supervision while playing. But most little girls would probably find this set alot of fun. Now if only they would make a school set big enough for the Generation Girls.
3,Not durable @ all,"I agree this set is easily broken & there are too many small pieces & as always with Barbie it won't go back into the box, so you can't keep the pieces together. My kids never play with it & never did. Save your money."
3,"Australian ""Mascara & Monsters""","Made in AUS in 2001, Serial# 8122-73534-2, Playing Time 78:11This australian exclusive has a slightly different content than ""Mascara & Monsters"", removing ""Is It My Body"", ""Be My Lover"" and ""Clones(We're All)"", while adding the full version of ""Halo Of Flies"" and the single version of ""Hey Stoopid"". Other tracks have also been replaced by their single version, namely ""Billion Dollar Babies"", ""Teenage Lament '74"" as well as ""Muscle Of Love"".The disc is about 2 minutes longer than ""Mascara..."", and just as the liner notes of the latter contained quick ""memories"" of each track, this edition does as well, with the appropriate adjustments for the change in content.I wasn't really fond of the US release (you can see my review there to find out why), and this edition is only slightly better: it still skips important releases, and doesn't warrant the bigger investment."
1,Not Satisfied,"I rated it low only because I thought I was purchasing a DVD not a book. I didn't want the book, but I do not know how to return it or if it's even possible."
2,Why did they have to change the old formula?!,"The Zia toner I received is NOT the one pictured. I used the old toner for years (the one pictured) and absolutely loved it for my rosacea sensitive skin. Zia has apparently overhauled its entire product line, for the worse in my opinion. I was sent the new toner with new packaging and a very different ingredient list even tho they still use the same descriptions as the old version. I tried it and my face immediately began that ""rosacea burn"" feeling and turned red. Very drying formula as well. It may work well on normal skin but this is NOT the product to buy for rosacea sufferers! I'm so dissappointed that I have to start all over in my search for mild rosacea-friendly products. Zia, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, you just lost a customer!"
2,Very hard to read,This book was very hard to read. I didn't finish it. I felt like I was back in college trying to get through an assignment every time I picked it up
2,Disappointing,"It's a Western without cowboys or gun play but that's okay. The characters are well-developed and I got to like them and care for the hero and the other the good people, both men and women. They suffer tremendously under evil men and a lot of terrible injustices, something that made me anxious for the ""vengeance"" that was yet to come. The bad news is that the hero wimps out and there isn't much justice. The evil men leave the story somewhat chastened and one assumes that they suffer bad consequences but the story doesn't mention it."
5,Finally a greatest hits that contains ALL his hits,This greatest hits is so good and so complete that you can sell your other billy idol cd's.Has every good song that I know of from him.
4,The Ultimate Billy Idol Collection,"This is the Ultimate Billy Idol Collection! From the early Gen X hit 'Dancing With Myself' (One of my personal favorites) to his biggest hits 'Mony Mony', 'White Wedding', 'Rock the Cradle', and of course 'Rebel Yell'. There is also a live version of 'Rebel Yell' and his remake of Simple Minds' 'Don't You Forget About Me'. The music is all really great, the album is worth buying. If you are going to buy any Billy Idol album, let it be this one!"
4,"HEY, DON'T FORGET STEVE!","There is often little credit given to guitarist Steve Stevens, Idol's partner for most of the major hits.Stevens is an amazing guitarist, and an incredibly talented writer, in his own right: Check out hisFlamenco A Go-GoCD, which came out a few years ago. Great disc.Also, if you want to hear Steve just wail on electric and acoustic alike, check out theBlack Light SyndromeandSituation DangerousCD's (both on the Magna Carta label), with Terry Bozzio and Tony Levin. Awesome stuff."
3,An ok CD,I thought he had more hits... I guess that I was wrong. Anyways needed to get this CD to go back to my high school days....
4,pretty good,I like Billy Idol. It was pretty good - you know the songs. It didn't have all I wanted but it was good. Wish it had ALL his good stuff instead of just a couple of them.
3,One missed,"Shame on you Bill for leaving out , "" Prodigal Son ""....perhaps you may have reasons.....Still...the CD is one shy of complete...ciao,"
3,Thorough Compilation for an Artist who Could Barely Fill One,"Where Billy Idol's place in rock history will fall is hard to say, but he did have a few memorable songs from the late '80's to the early '90's. This cd basically contains every song from Idol that you would like to own. Flesh for Fantasy, White Wedding, Rebel Yell, Dancing With Myself, Mony Mony and Hot in the City represent all of the classic Idol tracks. However, to this day I still believe the best track that Billy ever laid down was Eyes Without a Face. The song works on so many levels and is such a distinct break from his normal pop formula that it envelopes the listener. Structured with an amazing bass line, a heavy guitar break and those computerized claps this song simply blows away anything else he ever produced. Anyway, this is a great way to catch up on your vital Idol and a fine addition to any rock collection. Recommended."
5,Well worth the Money,"This compilation is well worth the money. I love every tune on this, especially the acoustic Rebel Yell and my absolute fave ""To Be a Lover,"" which has everything. . .a pounding rhythm, screaming background singers, wailing guitar solo, and fantastic beating up on the piano keys. In all, it is extremely satisfying rock music. Have mercy!"
4,Debating Development,"Those who have read Nussbaum's other books and essays on women, development and political theory will find here a carefully argued, contextually sensitive and principled approach to questions of global justice and human flourishing. Drawing on the work of Nobel laureate Amartya Sen (source of ""the capabilities approach"") and her own Aristotelian social philosophy, Nussbaum takes a hard look at key debates about development, rejecting both free market fundamentalism and underexamined cultural relativism. Her universalist stance is controversial but courageous, a sincere effort to think through a political ethic in the wake of globalization. Not everyone will agree with Nussbaum, but she asks the right questions and lays out positions to be argued with."
1,Very Out-Dated,"This video may have been good in it's time, but it's time is up. Very little information about procedures is correct for today. I was very disappointed in it. It was a real waste of money."
1,Childbirth from the inside out,"Do not buy this.My copy is so bad that it is hard to see and has many extra noises. I cannot even oouen it to see the 30 year old information. Unfortunately, I didn't look at it myself until after 30 days, so when I wrote to the seller, I was told that it was just my bad luck."
1,MORE HARM THAN GOOD TO WATCH,"This DVD is horribly outdated! I can't believe they put that footage on DVD format! It should be taken off the market. Where technological advances are so relevant, don't misinform yourself with this nonsense. Not only is it old, but it's filmed in such a non-comforting way. You're better off going to a childbirth class... even watching TLC's Baby Story show is more informative and palatable than this!"
1,AGREE - VERY OUTDATED,OMG is this thing outdated! Can't believe I wasted my hardearned $$. Save yours and do not buy this! Amazon - do your customers a favor and take this off the shelf.
3,Could have been better organized,"While the authors' passion for their subject is obvious, the information is very poorly organized and scattered all over the place. You have to sit down and read an entire chapter to find some important piece of information nestled away in it. There should be a clear table for T&T's complex transportation system, rather than confusing prose descriptions scattered all over the place. There should be an index of maps. The accommodation section is pretty good. There should be a better chapter on Carnival, with information on how to find the mas camps, buy tickets etc. The biggest gripe I have with it though is that transportation info, which is so crucial, is horribly presented."
5,Works Great,"Very good build and sound quality, wouldn't trade these in for a pair of beats or any other pair of headphones for that matter."
3,Uncomfortable,"These headphones are a great value! Sound quality is amazing, much more clearer than Beats. The only issue I have is that after a short amount of time they become very uncomfortable. When you first put them on, they feel great, but after about 30+ min, they noticeably feel uncomfortable. Definitely try these for about 30 min first if you can to see if it's an issue, I'm going to sell my pair because I can't deal with the discomfort."
4,Not what I expected so far...,I was so excited to get my hands on a set of these headphones; and after many years I finally made the leap. I have owned many pro headphones over the years and have usually gone with the Sony series. While these are awesome lookiing headphones; they are actually a little uncomfortable. I have only been checking these out for the last couple of hours; and I can't picture how my ears will feel after wearing these for a whole gig. Hopefully they get more comfortable in time. But so far they do not feel like they have as good of ear piece padding as the Sonys or the sound doesn't seem as on par to me. I love Technics products as much or more then the nex DJ.I will say this about these headphones; if they hold up better at the swivel point and don't break as easily as other DJ headphones then that will be well worth the money. If need be I will order another set of Sonys for those long nights mixing as my stand-bys.
5,I've bought three of these so far... Love them!,"I've actually bought three pairs of these. I DJ. I've used mine every single day for the last 2.5 years. A couple weeks ago I bought a pair for a friend as a present. This week, my old pair finally gave out. One side no longer produces sound. But let me tell you with the abuse I give them, I never expected them to last this long. It's amazing they've gotten this much use and made it. I'm so happy with them I came right back here and bought my third pair.They've also got great sound and great noise blocking thanks to the size and fit of the ear cups. I find them very comfortable and can wear them for long periods of time."
1,Do not recommend,"Product came out of the original box with several scratches and without one piece, lamentable. It was not a good deal."
4,Long standing Technic fan,"This is the 4th pair of these headphones I have bought. I've been dj'ing for over 5 years now and have tried a few different styles of headphones, but have always liked the feel and sound of technics over the rest. The weight keeps them on my head, as i tend to move around a lot, and the sound feels deeper and more full than comparable products. The one short fall i've found is that each pair, after approximately 1.5-3 years of use depending on how you handle them, will begin to crack right about the joint of the earphone to bridge connector. After it begins to crack, its a very short time until it fully breaks. I've found this to be a flaw in the design as it is constant pressure against the natural build of the headset, however, I enjoy the sound so much that I keep getting the same pair. 4 out of 5 stars for amazing sound, docked 1 for the consistent cracking."
1,"Compared to others, they DON'T match up","I have the Grado SR 125's and of course all Grado headphones are proper rated with the ""Hifi Award"". These and Dr. Dre Beats, you just can't beat them for sound quality and just overall the BEST headphones for professional and personal use. I just tried these technics that my brother has and I was pretty disappointed. They don't compare to either Grados or Dr. Dre Beats. They don't even compare to the Sony Extra Bass MDR XB700 headphones. I'm actually wanting to trade my Grados for these Sonys because they are incredibly comfortable, sound amazing, and have some bass. These Technics are too tight and DO NOT feel comfortable. Comfort and Sound Quality is crucial. Take my word for it. DO NOT GET THESE, PLEASE. Go with the Sonys if you have a cheaper budget. Grados and Dre Beats are obviously the best choice."
2,frustrating,"I loved these at first...awesome sound, super comfy, decent price and a name you can presumably trust. But just like other articulating headphones that I've bought, they're made out of plastic and they eventually crack. After that, the left side shorted out. Expect to get maybe 6 months out of these, tops."
2,"Good Sound, Mediocre Craftmanship","I purchased a pair of these 2 years ago after giving up on Sony 700's ( I was going through the sony's every 12-18 months). I read good things about these Technics, so I bit. I broke the first pair in 3 months, returned (even though out of warranty, I fought w/Panasonic and won) and broke the new replacement 3 months later. The sound is better than Sony, but durability at the joint is not good in my opinion. If you're kinder and gentler than me, buy these."
4,good price,I was pleased with the sound quality of this headphone. I've used Sony dj headphones and I must say that this Technics is as good as the Sony 700 but only cheaper. I would recommend this model.
4,Overall pretty amazing!,"This pair of headphones has such a broad range, deep bass, crisp highs, I can hear things in certain videosor songs I wasn't initially aware of. The only thing I have against these headphones is it's very uncomfortable to wear while wearing thick framed glasses. Other than that when I don't have myglasses on they feel great nice and comfortable. Worth the buy, plus the detachablecord is a nifty feature."
2,Sony 700's are still better,"I just got these today so I have no long term use with them yet. But given that the sound won't change much with usage I have to say the following compared to the Sony 700's: the bass isn't as deep, the midrange is the best point about these headphones, the highs trail off too fast probably from the upper midrange on (probably around 3500hz)and the Sony 700's have better imaging.I have more headphones on order as I type. I probably won't use these very much or at all. They say you get what you pay for. Well sometimes, given the relatively high price of these headphones, you get less than a good value.EDIT: Although not the same quality of sound or in the same price range even the Marathon 1100's by Audiovox marketed as DJ headphones are a better value. See my review on Amazon."
5,Best cans ever!!!,"Well the first time I put these on I was simply blown away! The highs and lows are beautiful. There is deep bass. They are high quality so all my lower bitrate files sound like crap now because they are that good. I will record it all at 256 in the future because you can hear the quality. They are kinda heavy and hurt your ears at first but now after wearing them now for about a month I don't even notice when I am wearing them. I walk around campus all day with these on so I get some looks. The chrome like ear cups give a nice touch as well. Also, the fact that you can disconnect the cord from the actual set is a nice feature as well. That will extend the life of the cans for sure as in the past a cord breaking was what caused my headphones to stop working. Now I have to ask myself, why didn't I get these sooner!? Buy these now. You will not be disappointed."
4,Good but a little bit tight,This is good headphones. Sound is good as far as I can hear. I am not a professional expert.The downside is that they are big and tight. I could not wear them for long time. It is become too hot. The same feeling I have if sit at home in a winter hat.Probably there is no way to make some free air circulation in such type of head phones. Then the solution is to choose a smaller headphones.I also have a pair of BOSE earphones. It has its own issues but they are smaller and more comfy.
4,DJ,GREAT HEADPHONES VERY STRONG MADE ..HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO OTHER DJS ...VERY LOUD TOO AS WELL .THE HEAD PHONES WILL OUT LAST OTHER HEAD PHONES.... I HAVE BEEN THRU ALOT OF HEAD PHONES..MY LAST SET LASTED ME 4 YEARS ..AND I DJ 3 NIGHTS A WEEK .JOHN
4,Very nice sounding,I really like this headphones. The sound quality is great. I have been using these for the last 5 months and I enjoy listening to house/hip-hop music on it. I would like to say that the headphones are a bit heavy if your not use to dj headphones. It can start hurting your ears after couple of hours.
4,a GOOD BALANCE,"I received the headphones fairly quick. I record and compose on a KORG Triton Studio and needed the headphones to do it silently. The sound quality is very nice. The bass sounds nice with these on along with the treble. I haven't tried anything else, but the price and the audio made this purchase a ""sound"" investment."
4,A Solid Performer,"If you're looking for perfect reproduction, don't buy this. Please keep in mind it was built for the live DJ and beatmatching and thus does not offer perfect fidelity.Having said that, it's rugged; the removable audio cord is a god-send (how many headphones I have ruined by stepping on its dangling cord while mixing); and oh-so comfortable.In sum: great for DJs. But if you're Joe or Jane Average, look elesewhere."
4,Vintage G & S D'oyly-Carte CD's,"For serious savoyards, this well-priced 4 CD set features performances by the D'oyly-Carte Troupe remastered from 78 rpm records recorded in the 1920's under the Direction of Rupert D'C, son of the foundind Richard. We get pretty clean and seamless engineering, as well as can be expected under the circumstances.I found Ruddigore the one I liked best. A meticulously faithful rendition of the work, and featuring some very eloquent voices, among them George Baker."
3,Gets a little repetitive and monotonous...,The main problem with this workbook is that it repeats the same worksheet format over and over for each new section--which gets old in rather short order. This has the effect of making learning tedious--not something you want to do with reading!!! My daughter much prefers the Sylvan workbooks. I won't be getting any more books from this series.
4,Patton PX405-U,"I am very satisfied with this air circulator. It is very quiet and powerful at settings I & II, noisy on setting III. The only negative to this product is that it is heavy to carry. However, I would not hesitate to recommend this product."
1,don't buy this,"I purchased this fan as an upgrade to a different patton fan. It appeared to be built better than my other patton yet after only three months it died. I am so disappointed and I feel like I should get my money back. Unfortunately, I never keep receipts so the best thing I can do is inform others of how bad and disappointed I am in this fan. Look elsewhere should you want a reliable workhorse fan."
5,Comfortable cotton shirt,"I wanted a Corvette logo T-Shirt with subtle graphics and this fit the bill.Its made of comfortable cotton and has an embroidered logo. I ordered 'silver', but this one has a very slight greenish tinge to it.Overall, I am happy with it and I'm sure it will last a long time."
1,Like knitting treacle,I have a development background but I found this book hard going. It was a little bit like being given a map and some directions but never being able to reach your destination - there was always something lacking or paragraphs went off at a tangent. I found that there was little logical structurein this book. I had to look for things in the later chapters before everything made sense in the earlier ones. I can't say I will be using this one as a reference. I think there are better ones around.
1,"Pelican, Boy has their quality gone down hill!","I first purchased one of Pelicans headlamps in 2001 and just recently it started to have problems with the switch. Well it has a life time warrantee but I thought well ""it had a hard life and did a good job"" I guess I will just buy two more that should last me for the next 20 years? Boy was I wrong! Less than one week and one of the two is already not working right. You have to push it together to get the light to come on, good thing I purchased two, at least one of the two works. I thought they were made in the USA but maybe they would work better if they came from China? I will be sending both back for repair my advice they should stick to making boxes."
5,Played it several times,"A few of the tracks I was familar with, and yes maybe I have a more lively / better version... but I was very pleased with the performances and sonics of the tracks. Anytime I go back and listen to a CD more than once (actually several times) I consider it a worthwhile purchase. I even recommended it to my son to check out. Guess that makes this a winner."
2,Warning: Do Not Take if you have problems with acid reflux,"I started taking this supplement on Tuesday. At first everything was great, then as the week progressed and I started taking the pills more my acid reflux began to act up. If you suffer from acid reflux, do not take it or ask your doctor before using the product. Trust me, it best to be safe and not take it. I been spitting up acid and dealing with brain fog when I started using this product."
2,Massive heart burn,Was not able to take it but twice and each time I encountered the worse heart burn of my life. Not for the squimish!!
2,worked for 2 days,"It must have opened in my stomach on the third day because I had terrible burning and burping up peppermint, which was not pleasant since it is strong and burns.Wish it worked for me like the others. Maybe I have more stomach acid than most. I will stick with peppermint tea and hope for the best"
4,convenient,"Although a bit pricey (whether in store or online with shipping and handling), this is possibly the most convenient way to take peppermint. It does help with my digestions, but not monumentally. I have purchased some peppermint oil that I will add to green tea in the future or just continue to drink peppermint tea. Tea has the benefit of working on symptoms after they occur instead of contantly trying to anticipate them."
4,Pepogest,"This product is pretty good - better than Beano. I have intestinal issues with diverticulitis, and this helped."
5,Very Effective,"Pepogest was suggested by my Doctor and I am very happy with it. It is very effective and has not caused any heartburn issues. It stops my symptoms immediately and I feel a lot better! I would suggest this to anyone with IBS, etc."
5,Swear by it!,"After I had my gall bladder removed, I continued to have episodes of queasi-ness due to my body's adjustment and by the meds I was taking. I read on the internet to try peppermint to calm my stomach and Pepogest was the first product I came across at the store, so I bought some. It worked wonders!! Now I use it for nausea and take some as a preventive if I've been exposed to anyone who has a gastro-intestinal virus (stomach flu). Yes - it makes your innards feel ""minty"" which can be an odd sensation. I too have acid reflux and a few times the peppermint has made it up into my esphogus, but I just drink a lot of water and everything settles down. I love this product!!"
3,ok but i have stomach ulcer,i have an ulcer. this pepogest really hurt my stomach. it says to take on an empty stomach but i may try to take it with food. but i'm scared to because it really burns. i've never tried peppermint oil caps before so i didn't know it would do this before i bought it. it may work for ibs idk.
3,Let's be sincere,"This book is what its title says ""FUNDAMENTALS"", I think it's a pre-basic book about Geophysics. There are other books better than this one, i.e. Telford's ""Applied Geophysics"" and Garland's ""Introduction to Geophysics"" (this is what Mr. Lowrie says)."
5,Nelson's Pocket Bible Concordance,"I like this little Pocket Concordance and carry it with me in my purse.It is pretty comprehensive, so when I need to find a scripture, it will usually lead me to it."
3,Bible concordance,"A good small bible concordance to carry around even tho' I use my android bible app now.For the $$$ it does help.Internet is the way to go now but, if you are not a techy this small concordance will do."
3,Serves its purpose,"Just needed this for a friend who is in prison, as he lost his concordance in a riot. I have not personally laid eyes on it."
5,Wonderful!,"What can I say?? Signing Time has been an amazing gift to our family. I had heard of signing with your baby and decided to try it with my son when he was 9-10 months old. He is now 14 months and can sign about 20 words. All thanks to Signing Time. It's entertaining for kids and adults (ask my 13 year old)! And it's all ASL, so we are learning a second language.And now we can listen to the songs and practice our signs when we are out and about! ""We've Got Love"" is my favortie and it's fun to watch my son sign rainbow when ""The Rainbow Song"" is on. His face just lights up!Kuddos to Signing Time!!"
5,Banana Republic has good taste,"I got this CD at Banana Republic after I had been listening to it over the in store speakers. I love bossa, lounge, chill and downtempo music and this hit the sweet spot. Includes the following songs:smoke city - underwater lovebebel gilberto - sem contencaosoulstice - illusionde-phazz - zero zeroles nubians - tabou (roots remix)mo' horizons - dance naked under palm treeszuco 103 - humananew phunk theory - la neblina del veranogroove armada - suntoucherdining rooms - sei tunicola conte - bossa per dueunderwolves - lay down"
4,Funkaholic yes I am,"I love these two disks, I always have been about diversity. I grew up in Berkeley,Ca. what can I say.I used to watch.Credence clearwater revival practice out the window during class. Moby Grape and Deep Purple hung out there in the park,also.They were cool but, I was deep into James Brown, Marvin Holmes and the uptights Early Whispers and Bloodstone, Sly And the Family Stone then came Tower of Power and Cold Blood and Motown through it all of course and Issac Hayes and John lee Hooker. But then George Clinton slapped me upside the head wid the Funk and I never recovered Thanks George,I needed that. I bring this all up becasue I hear it all in Axiom Funk. If Six was Nine is a perfect example But, Orbitron Attack reminds me of those early days of Funk and it doesn't get much better than this. All Funkaholics should have these cuts in their collection it's whole lot of that good funk."
4,levitron top,"The Levitron takes a while to calibrate, but works well. It took hundreds of tries to figure out. It finally worked once I added weights to it. It could be frustrating and requires lots of patience."
2,Not what I expected,"I was under the impression the was a levitating magnet that could WOW my girlfriends nephews. I'm giving it 2 stars due to my error and lack of research. The top will ""levitate"" but only when spinning and after much human intervention and trial and error. One must weight the top correctly, place on a plastic ""launcher"" of sorts, spin, then remove the launcher in hopes your spin was perfect enough to allow for about 5 seconds of ""levitation"". Once the top slows down, the wobble in the axis pulls it out of balance and its over. All of this takes practice and is time consuming and frustrating. Its more about the weight in the end to counter act the magnetic force. Kicking myself for this purchase."
3,Magnetic,This object doesnt really defy gravity Im guessing it floats by a magnetic field try putting a magnet around it.That is why its floating if it was antigravity that means I can put it on the floor and it will hover/float.
4,My son loves it!,"My husband and I bought this for our son at around 4 and a half months. At first he did not know how to turn, but now at 6 months, he's a pro! He loves the book, and I love the fact that you can put your own pictures in instead. The toys are stimulating, but not over stimulating.What I don't like is that the bottom is smooth and makes it difficult for him to grip, unless bare-footed. And there could be a better idea for adjusting the height."
2,Concerned First Time Mommy,"I recieved this activity center as a gift for my 4 month old son. I didn't have problems with paint chips however the pop-up doesn't really pop, it gets stuck all of the time. The other problem I see is the seat, my child's legs were rubbed raw after only sitting in it for about 15min. The other problem is he has hit his head on some of the plastic parts and has cut himself on the plastic book edges. I think this is a good toy for an older child but not for a 4 month old."
2,Somewhat disappointed,I registered for this when I was pregnant and received it as a gift. I wish I would've registered for a different one now. It was a long time before my son was able to touch the base with his feet so for the longest time we had to put a box under him so that he could stand up. There is no height adjustment! He would sit in it and play for awhile but every now and then he would start crying as if he was in pain. My mother-in-law thinks that the ball release was pinching him but we haven't been able to confirm. My mom bought my son an actual walker for Christmas and he prefers it over this. We also just purchased him a jumparoo that I am sure he will enjoy! My advice to all parents is to shop around. You may be able to find something that will work better for your little one!
1,DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!,"This toy is dangerous. Once my baby got big enough for his feet to touch the ground I took the bottom off so he could use it as a rocker. It immediately struck me that the wheels are spaced in such a way that if my son threw his weight around a little too much he'd be able to tip it over. But since I only put him in it 15 minutes a day or less and I'm always near him I figured he'd be fine. Sure enough it happened. He tipped the walker over and landed face first, upside down on the ground. I saw it happening and just missed catching him. He's fine, thank goodness, but it was scary. I looked up the toy expecting to see it had been recalled but I was surprised to see it has not been recalled and is being sold here and from other retailers. This product should definitely be recalled until they make some improvements."
4,Baby fun,Fairly easy to assemble and our 6 month old loves it. Extra nice in that it's an activity center and walker in one so that you don't have two pieces of large baby equipment cluttering the house.One mystery is why Kolcraft ships the product with the latch clips already installed as sometimes these can get broken in shipping and you'll have to order a whole new tray (they provide replacement for free)but it seems like shipping with them not attached would make more sense but I guess that's why I'm not CEO of Kolcraft????
3,not perfect but son likes it.,"I have had some of the same problems others have written in about. The arch that plays the music only works some of the time. It has nothing to do with batteries, just sometimes will play sometimes will not. And the red pop-up thing for my son to push on does get stuck as well. I never had a problem with any paint coming off of any part of the activity center and my son puts anything and everything in his mouth. He does enjoy playing in it and to me that is what counts."
4,"Nice watch, watch out for the battery","I bought the watch as a gift and it is a nice atch. Problem was it died in 2.5 months. When I sent it in to the manufacturer I was told that the batter ws dead and that it shoud have a 2 year life at least, and it was likley ""old"" stock so the battery was old. I was then charged $15 for a new battery and $10.50 to ship it back! That is not including the initial cost for me to ship it to the manufacturer. Amazon did offer to send me a new watc, but I turned that down. My fear was that I get another watch about to die from older stock and then in 3 months I am forced to spend money again to replace it. If that happens then I am out over $60 in 6 months for nothing! No.They did (Amazon) decide to issue a $30 credit to my account, which makes up for the cost to me. I do thank them for that. :)It is a good watch, just make sure you know about the possible battery issue."
3,Good glimpse,"Good glimpse of what life on a big tour can be like, at least at that time. Written effectively. Enjoyable."
1,Not what the customer ordered,"The description said used, and that statement is correct. However, the pages were worn, torn, folded, and extremely highlighted/ underlined through out the book. The description did not mention this. Afterall, there were other selections to choose from, and had the description said that I would've selected a different book."
5,A great classic french movie,"This a hilarious movie, while being realistic. The kind of simple movie, low budget that does not make you crave the Hollywood titles and $$$. Every few years, I take the DVD out and watch it again. If you can watch it in french, even better."
3,Big Band Memories,I do not mind that I purchased it and it is OK to watch it every once in a great while but the image and sound quality is poor and as a Swing/Big Band era fan I am disappointed.
5,Military pulp fiction,"Two Marines are assigned to make a trek hundreds of miles long to bring serum and a very heavy keg of something to a remote American consulate in Shunkien, China. Impossible odds because of the Chinese/Japanese war of the time. If a fully manned mission were attempted, it could be misconstrued as an act of war. A lot of high-tension action and some unlikely characters to make this a very entertaining read."
3,Orders is Orders by L Ron Hubbard (Audiobook Review),"In his own tried and true formula, L Ron Hubbard spins another tale of courage and heroism in the face of adversity. Hubbard's military fiction always features a gutsy, battle-hardened soldier, this time Gunnery Sergeant James Mitchell. Mitchell is as tough as any marine you'll find, but like any true hero, he has his weakness. For Mitchell, it's the bottle. Liquor is the monkey on Mitchell's back, and when he is given this rescue mission, it is there to haunt him every step of the way, tempting and taunting him. This conflict adds a nice bit of additional tension to the story, because we never know if James will give in, or complete his mission."
2,More of a Primer than a guide on How-To,"Based on the editorial reviews I had high hopes for this book. However it is more of a primer discussing some of the issues that surround the topic of shared services than how-to. The really tough decisions involving shared services are how to evaluate the potential programs to take on, how to integrate and manage the portfolio across the functional silos (i.e., finance, HR, real estate, supply chain, and IT), how to govern the shared services organization, and how to balance customer satisfaction with cost efficiencies. Unfortunately this book is not helpful in dealing with these issues.So if you are a newbie trying to find out what shared services is all about you may find this book helpful. But if you are a manager who has been charged with implimenting a shared services function, there isn't much help here."
3,Great holiday movie/horrible holiday price!!!!!,"I have this movie and I love it as much as my other Christmas movies. You will definitely have a warm fuzzy feeling from watching...But...............if you pay anywhere close to what these people are asking....that warm fuzzy feeling will be gone in a heartbeat.It's a great movie for the holidays, but $7.99 tops for DVD if it ever comes out on DVD and $4.99 for VHS tops.I have it, I've watched it several times, and I know what i'm talking about.....don't pay this kind of money for this movie or anything like it....."
5,Great Movie But This Price Is WAY TO HIGH!,I am I huge Dolly Parton fan and this is a great movie. I had a copy on VHS unitil I foolishly let someone borrow it and it was never returned. I wish it would be released on DVD. I would also like to see Kenny and Dolly's A Christmas to Remember special released on DVD. I just wanted to say its a great movie but its a shame people are asking such rediculous prices for them on here I think I only paid like $15 or $20 for the copy I had but that was quite a few years ago. I wish I still had my copy.
5,smoky mountain christmas,received merchandise as described............and products works great............and would recommend this to any customer looking for like items............and i received the merchandise in enough time for my gifts............thanks so much lost16mm
3,Love this movie,I absolutely love this movie. I know that they don't officially sell this dvd so i wasn't expecting blu ray quality. The video was as if it were taped on a vhs and they transferred it to a dvd. But as long as i have the movie to watch i am okay until they hopefully sell it officially on dvd
1,New,"First warning was the cover itself. Any average home printer could do a better job of printing than what was used. The DVD itself is also printed on using low grade equipment. Media Asia is the manufacture of this DVD and I guess I'm spoiled by American movie standards. But I could have done a better job of packaging with my own home equipment. The movie itself is just a copy from what looks like a VHS tape, very grainy picture and subpar sound. If you enjoy the movie and are willing to pay someone to transfer your old VHS then ok. This is pretty much what you will receive when you buy this movie. My wife (for whom I purchased this for) is very dissatisfied and wants to send it back"
1,BUYERS BEWARE!!!,"This film has NEVER been released on DVD for N. American play. If you buy a DVD listed here, you will be buying a bootleg copy burned from a VHS Tape."
1,BOOTLEG! BUYERS BEWARE,This video is not available on DVD - unless you want to buy this low-quality bootleg copy. Don't waste your money! This is a fake!
4,Smoky Mountain Christmas,"I agree, this is a great family movie. My mother introduced it to me when I was just a little girl. Now we look forward to seeing it every year. Although, they don't play it as often anymore. Good news for those looking for it. I found it on DVD, online, and dirt cheap just today!"
1,Price Gouging,"I absolutely love this movie, but this is ridiculous. You can watch it for free or DVR it on the Hallmark channel. I wanted to get this as a gift for my mother, but the prices on here is price gouging at its best."
1,Worst Purchase Ever,I purchased this DVD for a relative who is a huge fan. The DVD was like the old televisions when they had horrible reception. DO NOT waste your money on this poor quality DVD.
4,Hard to find movie,"The quality of the picture wasn't the best but this movie was hard to find, so it's worth it!! 4/5 stars overall."
2,Movie Damaged,"I don't want to give a bad report but the VHS that I bought ""Smoky Mountain Christmas"" cannot be played. I was very disappointed but oh well. If I could get another one sent to me I'd be very happy?"
1,"""Scary DVDs"" should be banned","Maybe I'm not aware of Amazon's policies regarding bootlegs or maybe the copy I received is perfectly legal, but it seems shady to me. First of all, this review is for the Smoky Mountain Christmas sold by ""Scary DVDs"". The case and DVD cover were obviously printed on an inkjet printer. The picture quality is a very bad rip from a VHS, the screen is fuzzy, audio is bad, and the brightness of the picture kept changing for the 5 minutes I watched of this. My wife lost her old VHS tape of this movie that she's had for 20 years and was so upset. I was hoping to surprise her with a new copy, but I don't think that will be happening this Christmas since I'm returning this DVD.I'll keep looking for a VHS or DVD of this online, but I would implore others to heed my warning: Don't buy from Scary DVDs...unless you want to support bootlegs and don't mind horrible quality products."
3,Great Movie,"This is a great christmas movie, it was a little expensive and I was a little disappointed because it was an old video rental movie and for the price I paid I wish it was a better quality, but it's a great movie, and I would buy it again if I had to."
2,BAD SMELL,"Did not like this product at all because of the strong smell, believe me, coconuts do not smell like that. I used it on my butt and legs instead because I could not stand the smell on my face and I did not want to waste the product after spending money on it. Would not buy this brand again."
