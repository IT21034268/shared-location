2,Why bother?,"This ""classic"" ceramic compost keeper is flawed in design. Fruit flies can get in. We've put it aside and bought a new one: a transparent cannister with a push-down button sealable lid. The biodegradable bag fits neatly inside and the compostables are kept airtight -- away from the fruit flies. The cannister is made by Oxo."
2,"A little too small, material a little too fragile","I thought this would be big enough for my roommate and myself, but it's not. We eat a decent amount of fresh produce and find ourself emptying this thing so often that the carbon filter doesn't even need to do its job. As often as we dump it, we could just use a bowl. Maybe for a single person or a house that doesn't cook much, this would be an OK size? I also find the material a bit too fragile. I chose this over some plastic models for durability's sake, but I dropped the lid onto the base from about an inch up and it chipped in 3 spots. Wouldn't recommend this modelUpdae: after about a year of regular use, one of the knobby extensions that the handle wraps around broke off while I was replacing the handle after washing the container. Now it's unusable, and not counting the handle, it retired to my trash can with 5+ sizabl chips that came all too easily, and one broken handle knob."
1,Poorly designed and overpriced,"Problems with this product- the porcelain was chipped on the one I purchased- the cover is lopsided and does not fit securely- the metal handle comes off every time I empty it- there is a wide lip on the container, so refuse gets caught inside the lip when it is emptiedI will probably throw it out and replace it with a simple covered pail, so that I don't pay an 80% markup for the word compost."
2,WOULDN'T BUY THIS ITEM AGAIN,"I BOUGHT THIS COMPOSTER FOR $22.00 TO REPLACE MY OLD ONE THAT COST 3.99. THE OLD ONE DID NOT SEAL UP TIGHT AND I WANTED A COMPOSTER THAT WOULD SEAL TIGHT TO KEEP ODORS AND FRUIT FLIES OUT. I SHOULD HAVE JUST STUCK WITH THE OLD ONE. THE FIRST COMPOSTER ARRIVED WITH A LID THAT DID NOT FIT THE CONTAINER AND ROCKED. THIS LID COULD NOT KEEP ANY ODORS IN AND CAME WITH A WELCOME SIGN FOR INSECTS. I EXCHANGED IT FOR A NEW ONE, AND WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE SECOND ONES LID FIT WORSE THAN THE FIRST. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS ITEM 2 STARS IS BECAUSE IT IS ATTRACTIVE AND LOOKS MUCH BETTER SITTING ON THE COUNTER THAN MY OLD COMPOSTER. IF YOU WANT ONE THAT IS AIR TIGHT, BEST KEEP LOOKING."
5,Just what we needed,The ceramic compost crock is just what I was looking for. During the vegetable growing season this summer we accumulated quite a bit of waste. The crock made it so easy to keep and even in the heat the charcoal filter never let any odor escape into our kitchen. It held up to a week's worth of waste before we had to empty it into our compost bin. So glad I purchased it. The red crock looks great in our white kitchen which we accent with red and black appliances and accessories.
4,Norpro Ceramic Compost Keeper,"Norpro Ceramic Compost KeeperIn our effort to ""Go Green"" this little container has really helped. It looks nice on the counter, doesn't take up a lot of space, easy to wash, and handy for storing waste. Would recommend to anyone who is composting."
3,Little Can,It's a little bit smaller than what I thought and it would have been great if it came in colors other than white. A bit costly for what it is but it's cute.
3,Packed in styrofoam,"First, I should admit that I bought this from an actual brick and mortar store, not from amazon. But my complaint is about the packaging from the manufacturer, so I assume it would apply regardless.While the outer box is cardboard, inside the box, the compost container is packed in styrofoam. Oh, the irony. There is no reason that either cardboard, or corn-starch based foam peanuts, could not have been used.As far as the container itself goes, we bought it to replace a somewhat ugly (and hard to keep clean) tiny plastic wastebasket that we had previously been using (which came directly from the store with no packaging whatsoever). This is clearly much more attractive, although a bit smaller in all dimensions. I would like it to be slightly larger.Too early yet to tell about its durability, which others have complained about. But my first impressions are that it seems fine to me."
3,"small, but effective","I haven't used this product yet, because I have been processing lima beans, tomatoes, peaches needing a gallon bucket. I plan to use this smaller container when the August harvest is over, and I'm not making so much compost at a time. The charcoal filter will keep the garbage smells from making my kitchen smell rotten."
2,"It's Pretty, I'll Give You That","The problem with this is it's not sealed. I get the holes in the top and the filter, but it should be sealed around the filter and around the lid. If you have a single fly...Well, let's just say it took about a week for this to become a maggot fest and now, even though I have no food scraps anywhere in my kitchen anymore, I'm having trouble winning my battle with flies. So, basically, this has just become a useless decorative jar in my kitchen and I still have to run my food scraps down the to composter right away."
3,composter so-so,"I love the way this composter looks on my counter, however the seal wouldn't stay on the rim, so my husband used caulk to keep it in place. Still doesn't keep th smell in. Wouldn't buy it again."
3,nice to look at but chips/breaks so easily,"This works and looks great, as long as you are very, very careful with the lid. It chips so easily inside if you don't put it on gently. I've had mine 1 month and broken and glued back together the lid twice now. It's essentially useless now, so I'm buying the stainless steel Norpro as a replacement."
3,OK,The rubber ring inside the lid falls off constantly and is hard to get back on. Without the ring there is not a tight seal. The lid is distorted and does not easily fit onto the container.Ronni Markwell
4,Me Likey,"This is a great way to temporarily store your compostables until you can dump them. Diswashwer safe. The handle on ours is secure. The lid does not seal as tightly as I'd like, so I plan to wrap a wide rubber band around the lid bottom. Also, the lip on the bottom, catches some compost when you dump it - not sure why they had to make it with a lip... I could use a bigger version, but really don't want anything larger than this on our counter."
4,Does what it Says,"This product is great for keeping compost in the kitchen. The only improvements I would make to the product is to secure the handle better to the pot. I would not carry the pot, when full, by the handle because it is so loosely attached. This however is not a major issue when sitting on the counter. I never smell the compost in the pot, until I take the lid off."
5,My parents love it!,Great product! My parents were using a plastic leftover container for years as their compost jar in the kitchen. This product is such an improvement!
5,Works Great!,This is such a practical thing to keep in our kitchen. It's a great place to store little scraps of things that we don't have time to dump in our compost pile outside (especially in the winter).
3,Lid doesn't fit properly,"I would assume that the plastic gasket on the lid means that the lid should fit snugly, possibly even creating a little vacuum. Not so, the lid is wobbly and doesn't sit right. One would think that is the opposite of what you want, with all that food in there. It doesn't seem to smell at all, but we will see when summer comes around and how many fruit flies we breed."
2,Cute but flawed,"Got the red one as a gift and LOVED it. It looked like a little fire hydrant on my counter. However it has two MAJOR flaws. #1 small size: it is so small that when cooking the average dinner, it could not handle the produce scraps/peels. #2 Handle design. The handle constantly slipped off the container, until finally it slipped while I was carrying it across my patio, and the whole container shattered.This item lasted me about 2 months, and I would recommend it."
2,Not so easy,"I was very excited to get and begin using my compost keeper. It looks great - the color is very bright and gets a lot of attention. It does not smell and since I live alone and do not cook every day, i can go a week without removing the compost. However, it's not that easy. The lid does not seal easily. It requires two hands to try to close and tighten the lid and it is also hard to take the lid off. It also attracts fruit flies and who likes those? I was pretty frustrated when I found the exact same compost keeper at a retail store for less than half the price.It's almost easier to just keep your compost in a freezer bag in the fridge or freezer until ready to compost it."
2,stainless steel is better,"This worked fine for us except for the lid, which could have been tighter. Then one day I was emptying it out in the yard and the handle slipped off and it fell out of my hands and broke, due to it being made of ceramic. So we bought a stainless steel one, not breakable, tight fitting lid, and a handle that won't come off."
1,Looks aren't everything,"Like many other reviewers, I bought this particular compost keeper because it is nicer looking. If I were reviewing this for looks it would get 5 stars; however, there is a ""lip"" inside the pail so when you try to empty your kitchen scraps, they hang up around the lip and don't come out. Now you have the choice of using your hand to scrape everything out or rinsing the keeper in your sink to try to get all the scraps out - neither is a good option. It also stains badly (not that it's a major issue because it's on the inside but it is definitely unsightly). So ... if you want something that looks nice, buy this one; if you want something that is functional, look at one of the others on the market. I'm almost hoping this one will break so I have a reason to go buy the stainless steel one!"
2,Not a good solution,"This product was recommended and seemed to fit what I needed. However, it caused an ant infestation. I would skip this product and get something with a lid that seals completely so that you have no unpleasant, unexpected visitors."
2,"Lid breaks too easily, capacity too small for practical use","This is made of heavy stoneware that is too fragile. I have granite countertops and members of my household have dropped the lid on the counter (not from very high either, like 2 inches) and the thing broke immediately. I superglued it back together, but it is too easy to drop when your hands are wet given how heavy it is, and it has broken 3 times in the year I've had it. It's also too small to be useful - when I make a big salad for 2 it cannot hold all the scraps, and I end up putting half of the peelings into a paper bag next to the compost bin which defeats the whole purpose (neatness) of buying it in the first place. Now that the lid has broken again for the 3rd time, I'm throwing this piece of junk away and buying a larger, stainless steel one. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Love it.,"I originally spotted this item in a cute specialty kitchen store in a small town, but didn't buy it then because their price was a little high. When I got a Visa gift card for Christmas, I figured why not splurge. Well, I was happy to find the same product here on Amazon for a much lower price. We've had it on our countertop right next to the sink since the moment it arrived. It looks really cool, and we haven't smelled even a hint of odor from it, despite having put both meats and vegatables into it and leaving them there for up to a week. Good product. I am glad I got it!"
2,"Ok, but poor lid fit, not the size advertised","My last Norpro product (3 qt Ceramic Compost Keeper, Blue and White) ASIN: B0037NYU6Chad a great fit. Unfortunately this new one not only has a very poor fit - it is exactly the same size as the last (3 qt) even though it is advertised as 1 gallon size. Had to replace the old one because I dropped and broke the lid (and no repolacements available).I tried putting a rubber band under the sealer band but the lid still rattles -- there is still about 1-2 mm gap between the seal and the jar. I even tried putting the new lid on the old intact jar -- same results.Basically extremely poor quality control and advertising from the vendor that is 'unconcerned about truth' at best.I'll use this one until I have problems like others reported - then probably have to go to a Brick and Mortar store instead of online to make sure I get one with a correct fit."
1,NOT as Advertised !,"The item listing states in its heading and in its discription that it is a GALLON size container. I""d like the Norpro people to let me know..... How do you get a Gallon (128 oz.) of liquid in this container ?...Since I was only able to get Three Quart (96 oz.) into it. Maybe the Norpro people can send me more detailed instructions on how to do it because they were not in the box. ** However, in all fairness it is a very nicely made product ! ! This is NOT A GALLON CONTAINER so if you need one it ain't this one !"
3,Looks great on the counter,"We love how this looks on our counter, and it does a great job of keeping the kitchen scraps nicely contained. The filter at the top really works-- there is NO odor, even after a week or so of collecting vegetable scraps, egg shells, coffee grounds, and the like.My only complaint is about the handle. If I'm not careful, it will come unhinged from one side as I'm carrying it--which is not something I want to happen on my way outside to the compost pile! I have learned to be very careful when carrying it."
3,does the job but it's fragile,"We bought the ceramic version because it looks much nicer on the counter. It holds a lot and does not stink up the kitchen so that's all good. However, the little knob on top has broken off twice, and the ceramic is a bit stained. We're wishing we had bought the stainless steel version instead. It wouldn't necessarily look as attractive, but I suspect it would be much more durable."
2,Unhappy,"I was very unhappy when this crock arrived, I have seen many of these crocks from differenr manufactures, This one being the most expensive I thought it would be the best. I was wrong!! Crock looks cheap, the handle keeps falling off every time it is moved. Handle made from cheap wire. I would have sent it back if I did not live in such a remote location where returns are very expensive. I will not advise anyone to buy this product."
5,Excellent produce,I love this container...it helps me compost! Usually I am too lazy to take the food outside so it builds up in an unsightly pile in a bowl until I set it outside where the coons have their way with it and make a mess. This way I can store the compost until the container is full and then take it outside. It looks good and there is no smell!
1,Lackluster container,"This container has several issues that warrant mentioning.1. it is heavy to carry2. There is no way it holds a gallon, maybe 2 quarts (false advertising!)3. The handle come off all the time which is not ideal when carrying it!4. The inside has crevices where food gets stuck making it difficult to get clean between fillings5. The supposed ""charcoal"" filter is worthless, as odors still permeate the kitchen.6. The quality of the ceramic is substandard, it chips easily.I've owned my for just a few months and it looks like it's been through a war. Wouldn't bother with buying another of these!"
2,Put outside!,I bought this thinking it would be a good addition to my kitchen. I do a lot of cooking. It is cute but it attracts bugs and I will not have bugs in my kitchen. I put it outside and it is no longer convenient so it is unused. I did receive it quickly and it was a good try.
5,Compost keeper is a winner.,This compost keeper does just what it's supposed to do and looks good while doing it.
3,"Pretty good, looks nice.","Looks nice for counter top. The metal handle hook holds on to ceramic posts I hope wont break off, only time will tell. Nice counter top piece for small things. I will probably still buy a larger plastic one to put under the sink.12-01-08 Still going strong, posts work fine. I did not buy a larger one as it holds more then I thought it would, on days I have alot I just run it out in a bowl."
5,Thanks to Jay & Amazon,"I originally ordered a Bosch 12"" miter-saw and waited over 2 months for it as it was on back-order. I guess the good magazine reviews sold a lot of these saws. I was not happy about waiting this long. But now am glad that I did.While I was waiting I checked out other saws here. I came across a couple of Jay's reviews and went to the local big box store to check out some of the options. Well, the Makita is by far the best saw out there. I suppose if I had got the Bosch I would have been happy with it simply because I wouldn't have known what I was missing.After contacting Amazons customer service department and expressing my dissatisfaction with the 2 month wait we worked out a deal were I changed my order to this saw, got 2 day shipping, all for a great deal. ($350 total) I feel sorry for all of the people who waited for the Bosch and missed out on a much better saw like this Makita."
4,"Excellent saw, but came with miinor damage...","Like all the other guys have said, this is probably the best sliding miter saw on the market. Mine came damaged. The little piece that is on the fence that aligns the flip up part of fence was broken off. I probably would not of even noticed it, however, I did notice that the flip up fence was not aligned with the main fence. I called Makita customer service and they said that I would have to deal with a local service center to get the new fence under warranty. Seems like a pain to me. I am just sad that the quality control inspection missed this detail. Other than that, this saw is wonderful and purchased it over the Bosch and Dewalt."
5,Dual Slide Saw,When our new house was built the contractor had this saw and he set it up in the garage to do his work. He told me that I could use it whenever necessary so I did use it quite often. When the time came to purchase a dual slide compound miter saw there was only one choice. Excellent quality.
5,"Sharks formed in 1973, not 1975","Nitpicking, perhaps, but the first Sharks album, First Water, was released by Island Records in 1973."
4,Different but still worthwhile,"I agree with one reviewer who states that this doesn't sound that much like the first two albums which were unique. I disagree with the rating he gave though, as there are still elements of the first two, and it's Snips and Spedding after all, and they have produced a very enjoyable rock album. I'll admit being apprehensive on first listen but it grabbed me right away. Just give it a chance and dont expect the same kind of production as the early 70's, its damn near impossible to duplicate, and this record stands up on its own anyway."
4,Good value,"I don't know about everybody else, but for the money, this is a pretty nice printer. I haven't had any problems with it in the year that I've had it. Very easy to use and quality prints. I've recommended Lexmark to anyone looking for a new printer."
1,Bleeding ink,Very disappointed after printing a few pages okay then all I get is colored paper. Red and yellow are bleeding on the page wherever characters appear. Inserting new cartridges didn't solve the problem.
1,"Low quality, little information","To start, a video on lighting gear should have good lighting... this does not. It looks like bad 1990 community access video.The information is terrible, and while the presenter keep talking about getting more information later in the video or on the web site... neither has the information. I expected a detailed parts list, plans for the light boxes, etc. You get none of that with this video.Stay away, you can get better information off a google search."
2,Sound It Out Land Phonics 1,"A bit disappointing! The video moves so quickly & the letter sounds are not very strong or reinforced. When it asks for the child to touch the picture that begins with a certain letter it does not even give the child any time to do it. After the first ten minutes my daughter lost interest. After paying twenty dollars for it, I will turn it on again for my daughter & hopefully she will get something out of it. I will not be getting the other 2 videos."
2,Not as good as expected,My toddler is 26 months old and already reads his letters and knows the alphabet. I was hoping to get something entertaining that would now associate the actual phonics of the letter to make it possible for him to start reading and sounding out words. But I was disappointed mainly in the visuals of this tape - it was boring and looks like it may have been done as a low budget - plus the singing was terrible (except for the last song sung by kids). We will continue to watch it but I will not get the following tapes...
1,My daughter hates this video,This turned out to be a big waste of money. My daughter hates it and turns off the television anytime I put on this video.
3,I prefer BIC ball pens,"BIC pens are so much better than the other pens lying around at work which are not as smooth and not as comfortable to hold. Good buy for the price. It's nice to have a dozen lying around given that I always seem to misplace pens, it would be easier to find one when I need it. Three stars because I didn't realize that these are Round Stic pens and not Ultra Round Stic pens which are slightly more expensive but also seem to write smoother."
3,So so,Bics have always been my favorite pens and still are. I gave it three stars because the product they sent me wasn't the same as the picture on here. I was bummed about that as I really like the ones pictured. I didn't send them back because I love bics and it was only a couple of bucks for them so I kept them. I will have to find the ones I really want somewhere else since this picture was misleading. Other than that the bic pens are great! Comes on smoothly and I can always trust that it will always write (unless it runs out of ink).
4,problem with caps,this pen writes well but the cap sometimes sticks to the pen itself and pulls the pen apart while opening.
3,Aunt Dimity's Good Deed,"The third book in the Aunt Dimity series, Aunt Dimity's Good Deed has been my favorite so far. They seem to keep getting better as the series continues. I rated it 3 stars, but 3.5 is a closer rating for me. I truly enjoyed the book and finished it in a weekend.We find Lori back again in this book, 2 years after Aunt Dimity's Death. A new family mystery has her travelling in England and meeting many new members of the Willis family. With her trusty sidekicks,Nell and Reginald,she goes in search of Willis, Sr. who has disappeared!These cozy mysteries keep me coming back to the Aunt Dimity series. Although I always read series in order, each of these books stand apart quite well."
5,Entertaining,"Reading this series is like eating potato chips: you can't read just one. Each one is enjoyable in a different and yet similar way. They are cozy mysteries with an attitude. I highly recommend reading this series in order. The development of character, in Lori and in all the people in her world, is an entertaining journey."
4,cute and sweet mystery,"The Aunt Dimity books are perfect for relaxing with a cozy mystery book. I've read the first 4 now, and plan to read more when I start back at work and need a break when I get home. It's a nice change from your average mystery book."
5,The star of the Disintegration Loops,"This is easily my favorite of the Disintegration Loops albums, and ""d|p 4"" is certainly my favorite track therein. Unfortunately only 20 minutes long, this track is an absolutely beautiful work of art. Heavy disintegration only halfway through the track leaves the loop barely clinging to life at the end - perhaps the best representation of the meaning of Basinski's work.Go into these works with an open mind, and take the time to understand Basinski's purpose in creating the Disintegration Loops. I hope that you'll enjoy them as much as I have."
2,Disappointing,"Every time I use Norton 3X papers, I end up disappointed at how quickly they wear out, much sooner than expected. I don't really understand the 5 star reviews here for that reason. I only buy this because it's the only brand my local Home Depot carries.The reasons I gave it 2 stars is that the grain size is uniform and the backing paper is strong, thin, and flexible for easy loading on a power sander.I'm open to any suggestions of other brands to try."
3,So So,"I didn't care as much for this one as I did for the first one I bought, The Weavers - Best of the Vanguard Years.I'm glad I bought it first or I wouldn't have gotten it."
2,Not for strong chewers...,"I was really disappointed in this product. I got it for our dog when she was about five months old after reading reviews about the jolly ball. I am guessing they are quite different, but in minutes, my dog had taken out bits from the chipmunk (she has sharp teeth). I promptly returned it."
2,Depeche Mode is better,"Some sample songs by this artist I downloaded (from a site I can't remember) some time ago were fine, so I assumed I Start Counting would be great.Not really - they aren't well-known in contrast to Depeche Mode. Get the real McCoy (saying) instead.Sounds like homemade demo versions. It might be a better choice as experimental music and for sound loops.I am dissatisfied in all three albums purchased (Catalogue and My Translucent Hands).Vocals remind me of The Doors. Maybe a little like Iron Butterfly. (I once had The Doors and have Iron Butterfly.)If you are looking for music with consistency and 'not too different' from the norm, I Start Counting would be my last choice. Listen at your risk (I mean, if you were expecting this artist to sound or attempt to reproduce the style of Depeche Mode.)"
5,nice tv; great customer service from amazon,"We ordered this to use as a second tv in the bedroom. It is a nice size, and the flat screen is great. I don't know all the technical details about color and ratios and such, but we have been pleased with it.When it arrived, it worked for about 5 minutes and then quit. Amazon sent out a replacement right away and also paid for return shipping (UPS came to the house and picked it up). You can't ask for better customer service than that! I would recommend this item to anyone."
4,Nice Tool Set,"I like this product. The torx sockets seem well built and the rail keeps them organized. The sockets are a grey color and would have preferred chrome, but they are as pictured so knew what I was getting."
5,great value,I found these sockets to be well made and just what I needed when i ran into some odd bolts on my vehicle.Recieved them in a timely manner and got my vehicle back on the road.Will surely need to use them again.
4,Buenos Cubos o Good sockets,"Me parecen una buena compra. Los cubos lucen exactamente como en la foto mostrada, asi que no tienen una superficie de acero inoxidable, por lo que espero que en algunos meses se vean muy oxidados, pero ese el aspecto de las herramientas con este tipo de acabado en la superficie, que es como satinado. Vienen con un riel en la base que sirve para sujetarlos. Talvez debi comprar cubos con superficie de acero inoxidable y con cajita o estuche para poder guardarlos. Pero el precio esta bien y eran los más baratos."
4,Fit great,Had to order these to get the wheel bearing assembly off my daughters car. They are well made and worked perfect for the job.
5,Great for the price,"They're not fancy chrome bits but they get the job done. No rust issues, no fitment issues. Works great for everything I've used them for"
4,Great little set!,"Solid construction with good wall thickness and depth. 1/4"" & 3/8"" square drive sockets are smooth, with no locking detents.Metal snap-in holder generally works very well (unlike plastic, which usually cracks), but will not stand upright in tool box (the old Craftsman tapered metal trays with flip-cover are still the best...).Note that the finish is NOT polished chrome, but a dull satin texture. Each socket is marked, but only on one side.Overall this is a very good value. Most local stores in our area did not carry these at all, and the ones that did were priced >2X this set."
4,take it to the beach...but it's better than that,"by all means take this book on vacation, but know it's a satisfying read. Ms. Lynn weaves a story that takes her characters from past to present, leaving hints along the way, of how fragile a young marriage can be if not tended to. The disappearance of Jessica, under not suspicious circumstances butpuzzling ones, lends David an opportunity to replay their marriage using threads of previous travels and unresolved endings. Fun read...wish I knew what made Jessica tick."
2,left hanging,"The overall plot was amazing so I figured the entire story would be worthwhile. For a while, until it rambled on about David's work, it was a great depiction of the inner turmoil someone faces in that situation. The end was just not enough to sit through reading the entire book. I was completely disappointed. One and a half pages or so to explain what happened just didn't cut it and it was a little unbelievable."
3,"Good, Could've Been Great","I bought this book thinking it was a suspense novel, as it is supposed to be, but upon reading it - it really isn't.I think that the author has a great concept for a novel, she even started off on the right foot, but it fell flat in my opinion, and the end was a huge let down.**(Possible spoilers ahead)**I think this book would've been much better if the author had Jessica disappear, and then focused in on how David and Jessica's life changed as a result. How Jessica rebuilt her life from scratch, and how David got along never knowing what happened with his wife. It would've been fascinating to think that Jessica never moved out of New York and perhaps came upon David without him knowing, or maybe he does recognize her but isn't quite sure enough to approach her.I just think overall that the book was a good start for a story, but needed a little more work to really get itself off the ground."
2,Came up short for me,"I also didn't care for this book. The premise is compelling, but the characters are rather unsympathetic. Perhaps I missed something, but very little of the discussion of Jessica led me to a deeper understanding of her actions. The Jhensen conclusion was similarly questionable to me."
1,I see an awful book...,"This was one of the worst books I have EVER read! The premise is great and gets you hooked in, however the story goes awry quickly. There is also a storyline about a missing American in Peru and that made zero sense. Nothing ever came together. Seriously, after the wife goes missing just skip to the last chapter and you will get the same thing out of the book as someone who read it in its entirety. The author should have picked a story and wrote it instead of this mish mash of nothing."
2,Now you don't.,"Through his wife's disappearance, David displays emotions that any of us would have. But after the first few chapters of the book, we're basically just living inside his head. I don't feel that is compelling enough to write an entire book about. By the end of the book (and thus, finding out the entire story), I was actually miffed that I wasted my time and money on this thing.I bought this book after reading all the praise for it on Amazon.com (and in People magazine). I just wasn't impressed. I have read many books over the years and though this one had an interesting concept, the execution of it was horrible. After doing some investigating, I noticed that most of the people on Amazon that reviewed the book had reviewed only this book. Makes you wonder if they're somehow connected to the author. (She used to work for People magazine, as well, hence the apparent kudos from them.)"
2,BXY440,"Sent back and exchanged 3 times ,most of pitches work good but a few not quite able to work properly."
1,Not very helpful,"Although the book as the word 'Understanding' in its title I did not find it to be very useful in clarifying the concepts at all. I read the two chapters of MANOVA and Factor analysis, and although i had all the jargon that anyone would ever use when discussing these topics i had no idea how to connect them. this book is neither for beginners (as it does not explain concepts) nor do i think it is detailed or rigorous enough for advanced users."
2,"Rowse a scholar: not on the evidence of this book,","Rowse's stereotypical attitude to the ""cause"" of homosexuality, (A Mother's Boy) figures prominently in this very poor study of famous homosexuals in history. The book read in the 21st Century shows up the superficial analysis of several people in this book. His rant on Wilde was hilarious which is about the only reason to ever open the book. You get the feeling that Rowse thought more highly of his abilities than posterity will endorse."
2,Very Limited in usefulness,"My son found this video interesting but it is really an advertisement for the computer game. It works as a tutorial for the game with long pauses for you to ""point to the answer"" but it doesn't work as a straight learning video. While the songs were fun to watch without the game my son quickly lost interest."
5,Simply the best,"Britney has outdone herself on this single; the versions of ""I'm A Slave 4 U"" are outstanding, like what Vanity 6 would sound like if they were still around. The Neptunes production shines throughout, and Britney delivers the lyrics with flawless phrasing. The interview segment is great fun, as one can play interviewer while Britney answers the questions. Comes complete with interviewing script!!! Buy this now!!!"
5,It's great.,"I love this song. 4 real. It totally shows how Britney is growing in her life and in her career. She's obviously making a statement. She's not a little girl any more, and she wants everyone to know. She's letting us know without getting all up in our face. Plus it's a perfect ""clubbin"" song. It's totally cool and totally Britney!"
4,Amazed,"When I first heard that Britney's first single off of 'Britney' was going to be ""I'm a Slave 4 U"", I thought, 'That sounds like it'll be awful.' I mean, I was seriously disgusted by a song where the title says that you're a slave for someone.Then, I heard it...and I didn't like it immediately, but the more I heard it, the better it sounded.So now I'm here recommending this to everyone reading. This song is probably one of Britney's most innovative, creative, and funky songs...along with one of her bests. So, get this CD today and listen to the song over and over. You'll really enjoy it. I know I do."
1,okay....?,Im sick of Britney. She cannot sing. Her voice is annoying.She is annoying. But thats just my opinion.Im more of a rock n roller. Im sick of the pop artists whodances and lip sing. Their stupid repitive dance moves.All pop music is just starting to sound alike. All they talkabout is being heart-broken....its always the same ol' story.I cannot relate to this stupid music. I like music that I canrelate to. I just dont understand [what] these pop artistare singing about...Hey Britney? We all go thru the 'I'm nota girl but not yet a woman'...
1,Awful,"This has got to be one of the worst songs I've ever heard. The lyrics are nonsensical, the beat erratic, and it all comes off as just a bunch of noise. I'm a moderate Britney fan, and have enjoyed most of her work, but this one is a stinker."
1,YUCK,"this is the worst work britney has ever done. the computer (as always) does the singing for her more than ever, the tune is awful, the lyrics are stupid, and it just proves that ms. spears has no real talent in terms of singing.she should be a back up dancer to a more gifted artist."
1,Used item sold as new,"I totally hated to open a product sold as new, only to find out it was opened, damaged and resold. Although they received the item as a return, I had to pay the shipment of the return, and they said that it was sold to them as new. ???? It was OPENED!! How could they receive it as new, and worse, ship it as new. The most disappointing thing was that I needed the adapter to watch a family video that weekend and of course we could not watch it! So I don't want to buy from them anymore."
5,VHS Adapter,I had to have one to view a cassette I had received from family. It did just what it was suppose to do and we got to enjoy the tape.
3,Note its Star Wars,"Toy seemed ok but since I did not see box and apparently did not read description, this is a Star Wars toy rather than Star Trek."
4,A wonderful introduction to earth science,"This is not one of the 25 volume ""Life Nature Library"" series, rather it is one of the 12 volume, abridged ""Life Young Reader's Nature Library"" series based on the former series.An excellent, if dated, introduction to the nature of our planet. It includes wonderful illustration and artwork of the type ""they don't make anymore"". Extremely readable not only for young people, but adults aswell. Don't be mislead by the 'Young Reader's' designation- this is serious stuff. The genesis of this series was the white-hot focus on science education of the 1960s and the result is that this series assumes a level of sophistication among its target age group that publishers cannot assume these days. Impressive and slightly discouraging at the same time."
4,"Hard drive adapter works, but you still need a mount","I purchased this to hold a hard drive in place of the DVD drive tray. While it fits the spot very well, as expected, it does not come with everything you need to put a hard drive in it. You also need to buy a mount that you attach the hard drive to and the mount then gets securely housed in this adapter. Luckily, I had one from the last laptop adapter and it worked well. But for your average consumer, you may be surprised to know that you actually need more parts prior to getting this to work for you."
3,Not as good as the first and not a 5 star.,"This album is okay but just not as excellent as The Shins' first album Oh, Inverted World. I have to believe that anyone who gave this album a 5 star didn't listen to the album preceding it. I've listened to Chutes about 5 times so far. I'll continue listening to it and digesting the music. However, I already know this album falls short in excellence compared to the first, which I did award a 5 star to. Take care, C"
2,"There is a reason for the two stars, read on...","The musicianship and songwriting on this album are very strong.Melodies and atonal riffs pop up in the best of places.The Shins are innovative, quirky, and undeniably GOOD.A certain subset of you will know what I am talking about when I say...The vocals are atrocious. Yes, he employs a vocal style many of you are familiar with...but think of , lets say, Strokes boy Casablancas himself...a sexy voice makes up for a weak song...(sometimes,also ask Iggy)but a whining wail can destroy a great song...The Shins write great songs, some of you enjoy this type of voice, some of you won't.I did not."
5,You will enjoy this,"Listening to Saint Simon right now, pop heaven. This album is beautiful. That is the best way I can describle it."
2,Unpleasantly surprised,"I had heard alot about The Shins from alot of different people. All these people hyping them, I thought, can't be wrong. So I bit and got the album. And all I can really think is...'Is this really The Shins? No, it can't be'. But alas, it was. True, there are a few tracks that are o.k. (track 6 for example), but I'd have to say this album far from lives up to the buzz around the band. Sorry y'all. I just don't see it."
4,Blissful,"Buy this directly from Sub Pop and save a buck.... http://www.subpop.com/scripts/main/catalog.php?cat=true&display;_type=merch&title;=Chutes+Too+NarrowGreat summer album. Beats ""Oh, Inverted World"" I reckon."
5,Best thing in the last 10 years,"I love music and have a fair obession with it. It's mostly under control, mostly, and I admit to being a little overzealous in my collecting and raving about some of it. Not all of it. Just the good stuff. This album has risen above the rest, separated itself from the pack, and has proven to be part of the good stuff category. In fact, I've listened to it so much lately and have been floored by it so consistently that I would say it's the best album I've picked up in the last ten years. It's so original and so well put together, so fresh, that it is injected me with a sense of hope that everything COULD be this good. Not everything is, though, and that's why I love this album. It's the cream of the crop, man."
5,Warning: these songs will stick in your head!,"I read about this band in a couple of different magazines, and I loved the CD the first couple of times I heard it. (I listen to a CD twice before I have an opinion on it.) I hear lots of influences with each song, and some remind me of other bands. Rather than list them, I'll leave it open to others to figure out.There are ten great songs with catchy hooks and thought-provoking lyrics (the last song does drag a bit, but it's a minor flaw on an otherwise brilliant album). Yes, the album is short, but this is what the ""repeat all"" function is for! I listen to this CD often, but now the songs have become stuck in my head (see title)!This is one CD that you MUST own! There aren't too many albums that anyone can listen to from start to finish, but this is one of them.I put this on my new MP3 player, and I will never delete it!"
5,"Impressive, more diverse than the first","There are many albums that toe the line of creative brilliance and fall short by a few wasted lines, a song or two overkill, or simply because some can only reach so far with the formula they've compiled. The Shins were a great band to begin with, but they've achieved a new level with Chutes Too Narrow. Everything comes together perfectly from the vocals to the occasional slight of hand percussion to the acoustic mastery. The lyrics can be too abstract at times, but splendid in form nonetheless. Is there a more enjoyable album to listen to? You'll be hard pressed to find one."
1,Disappointing.,"It sounds too similar to the first album. The bass player isn't as good on this one, however"
4,"Great, despite hip namedroppings in overpraised films","I saw The Shins at The Backyard in Austin, TX recently. Walking out of the facility, amazed by how tight and energetic the band had been, my girlfriend and I were still in awe as we followed behind an elderly couple in their sixties, if not seventies. The man leaned over to his wife and said, ""You know, they're much better live."" We laughed at the incongruity, but the old man was right. The singer's voice is a bit thin on the record; live, he sounded fantastic, much more powerful than we anticipated. Likewise, the band was much better than the production would suggest. The songwriting on this LP is quite good (and not even a tiny bit reminiscent of Modern English) but with the help of a good producer, they may yet produce greatness."
5,Intelligent Music,"Listen or at least read the lyrics to ""Saint Simon"". This music is soothing and melody based. The Shins have improved from their freshman album (although Inverted World is also a spectacular piece of music) which is evident from their ever expanding bag of musical tricks and diverse structures that they use. I can't wait to see what The Shins conjure up for their next album as this is a band that is clearly getting more musically mature with every passing day."
4,nice...,"People are freaking out. I think alot of that is over-reaction. This album is nice in that it feels young and fresh and quirky and original... but not the saviour of X.One interesting thing is the album is united by reocurring themes/lyrics. He mentions burying somthing in the yard in one song, then in annother song he talks about ""her"" going into the yard to find somthing. There are numeruous reoccuring kites, chutes, beds growing grass etc... Thats interesting and fun to discover.I would say that about half of the songs are super nice, the other half I have to try not to skip.So if you skip every other song...you have about 15-20 minutes of original music.But these guys definately have a future.This isnt the greatest thing ever...unless, musically, you dont get out much. But if you buy tons of crap...this is worth it."
3,Chutes Too Narrow,"This is no 'Oh, Inverted World,' but 'Chutes Too Narrow' (like this band's aforesaid mentioned debut) represents everything that is right with music today. Listen as the Shins toy with new sounds and styles. The Kinks-esque sounds of 'Oh, Inverted World' are largely gone. What remains are the short, tidy tunes and the sense that one is listening to a band that will produce more and better music in the future."
3,nniiccee,"Good cd, not as good as *Oh, Inverted World*, but good. I believe all the fans of the shins will be impressed with this album a little. For people a little new to the shins, i suggest purchasing * Oh Inverted World* first."
4,Give it more than one listen.,"On first pass fresh out of the store this CD didn't really grab me like Inverted World. On my third listen now at home and it stands up well. Much different from Oh, Inverted World. I recommend you give a few listens it will grow on you. Nice clean production too."
3,3.5 Stars For a Good Cd,"Ok. I just wrote a review for the new Polyphonic Spree cd. go check it out. But anyways its The Shins I should be talking about, so here we go. The Shins sound so much like Hot Hot Heat it is kina weird. There both on Sub Pop Records. So if you like pop rock keyboard driven songs here you go. I like it. Kissing The Lipless is a great track. So is ""So Says I."" Actually all of the first half of the cd is great. But then when you think this cd is a masterpiece, it slowly falls apart. Slow songs come on. All that keyboard is lost by very dull acoustic tracks. Dont get me wrong the songs are good but not as good as the first half of the cd. So calling this cd a masterpiece probably isnt a good idea. Calling it a worthy cd to listen to is a good idea. Pick it up if you like synth pop. Good stuff from some good guys."
4,May be great,I keep listningTo evrything I can freeAnd I think on the categoryOf the who or the kinksBut I'm waiting to see
2,Sounds like 1966 wich in this case is bad.,This album sounds like 1966 Pop/Rock and also some what crappyform.They even somehow manage a little like the Beac BoysLyrics 6/10 Production 7/10 Music 8/10 Style 3/10 Voice 5/10Overall=29/50 wich is 2.5 Stars not all that inventive
1,title of review,"Move over Radiohead, I think we may have a new contender for most overrated band ever. There are a few minor moments of musical worth on this album, but ultimately, most of this music isn't anything your 12 year old brother who just picked up his first acoustic guitar a month ago and has just begun strumming some standard chords couldn't write with little trouble. The adulation this band have received is really puzzling to me. Do people just like the idea of listening to something that sounds completely unprofessional and talentless? The novelty of knowing that anyone could have made it? Does that make it easy to identify with or something? That they're just a bunch of guys having fun?I really don't know what else it could be, because these songs really are some sub-par compositions with little or no melodic/harmonic value."
4,A worthy follow-up,"The Shins are an innovative, refreshing band in a sea of much rock-effluvia. I was really anticipating this group's 2nd effort (As Oh, Inverted World enchanted me and continues to do so)and, think it is growing on me w/each listen. The laid-back and unassuming mindset from which these guys come make them very interesting and fun. Listen for all the changes in the song ""Saint Simon""...and the lazy, thoughtful folkiness of 'Pink Bullets""...Lyrically, musically, and atmospherically, they are a band to pay attention to for a long time to come."
4,Listen at least twice before you write a review,"It's tough to compare a band's 2nd album to their first, which you absolutely love now that you've listened to it 50 times. On the Shins second album, James Mercer has proven that he truly is a songwriter among songwriters. This album is fabulous. I especially love the songs with the harmonica. The only reason I gave this album 4 stars is because I can't in good concious give an excellent album 5 stars when perfect albums like Let it Bleed, Revolver and the Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust are out there. Listen to this one again....and again and again, then you'll see."
3,"tame, but inventive","to preface my review, i purchased this CD at the same time as buying the mars volta and new machine head. my music tastes do not run the lines of the timid typically, so this was a bit of a shocker. i bought it at the recommendation of the dude in tower records and a friend who shares (i thought) similar music tastes. that said, the CD isnt bad. it's taken some getting used to, but as ""indy"" rock goes, i guess it holds water. there are definite beatles and smiths influences, and the songwriting is pretty catchy. but this isnt something youre gonna rock out to. im not disappointed, but i probably wouldnt buy it again. it just isnt what i hoped it would be...."
4,love it,The first time I heard this album I wasn't sure about his voice. The album & voice grew on me. Now I love it. Has a beach boys vibe.
5,No Sophomore Slump Here...,"Want Hooks? This disc has 'em! Want pop music SHOULD be all about, catchy melodic tunes & wonderful harmonies, backed up with intelligent, slightly quirky lyrics. This album picks up where ""Oh Inverted World"" left off....then outpaces it like a rocket. This second effort makes the first album seem slightly one dimensional. ""Chutes"" takes all of the elements that were present before, and raises the bar. Different genres are hinted at throughout(and I DEFINATELY hear some Ray Davies & The Kinks in Mercer's songwriting), but make no mistake this is a power-pop record. Production on the latest disc is more polised, maybe more radio-friendly. This CD has not left the changer in the car for days, and will likely be one of my favorites of the year."
4,Good album for Shins' fans,Not my favorite by the Shins but still a great album. One of the few bands I can say that I like 90% of their songs.
5,Brand new fan,"Just give this album a few listens and you will fall in love with it. Every song is solid and several venture into greatness. I hear lots of different influences but they're really just fleeting moments that somehow sound familiar. The Shins really have there own unique sound. I also highly recommend 'Oh, Inverted World' another album that, after giving it a few listens, will reveal its greatness."
4,Songs too narrow,"I heard a lot of critical acclaim for the Shins, so I decided to check them out. While I didn't hear their first album, I can still see that Chutes Too Narrow is pretty enjoyable.I'll also say that the Shins seem to be another band whose style has a more ""classic"" feel -- in this case, some of the songs are not unlike what we heard in the `80s. They kind of sound like a combination of Tears For Fears and the Cure, and they use this style to deliver nice stuff like ""Turn a Square"", ""Kissing the Lipless"", and ""Fighting In a Sack"".One thing I noticed, though, is something I mentioned in the review title. A couple of songs are too short -- not that they aren't good, but you can tell they're building up to something but then the songs just end (see ""Young Pilgrims"" and ""Gone For Good""). I also didn't like ""Mine's Not a High Horse"" as much as the rest of the songs. But Chutes Too Narrow is still ideal for having a knee-slappin' -- I mean, a SHIN-slappin' good time.Anthony Rupert"
3,very disappointing,"I just don't get it. People think this CD is comparable to Oh Inverted World? The only song that I like on this CD is ""Saint Simon"", which is absolutely phenomenal and why I'm willing to give the CD three stars.Saint Simon sounds more like the stuff from Oh, Inverted World with its baroque sound. Most of their other songs are much noisier and going off in a different direction from what they did before, and just don't measure up in my view."
2,What's the BIG deal?????,"I don't get it folks, yes it's a greatly produced album with good lyrics but come on... Everyone on here makes it sound like this album is the best thing since sliced bread. Just another sub-par pop album with grown up lyrics. I absolutely love their last album, ""Oh Inverted World"", but with this it seems... it's just missing something or lacking the rawness of their previous record. I give this a 2 star rating because, now everyone is on the ""indy bandwagon"", it's like everything else that is coming out of the industry,puck. Their is nothing new, this album deosn't make me think, playing of insturnments is par, and its just plain BORING."
3,"For those of you who rate this album a ""masterpiece"" ....","Some good moments? Absolutely. But more than anything, a prime example of how inexplicable hype propels an above-average album to unnecessary heights. ***FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO THINK THIS IS A ""MASTERPIECE""*** -> Please go buy any early Elvis Costello album -- say, Trust, or Punch the Clock. In other words, learn a little more about music, then see if The Shins still warrant your awe."
3,Disappointing...,"After the simple majesty of the first album, ""Chutes"" is a letdown. Mayb 5 songs measure up to the first record, but that's it."
4,More Head Than Heart,"As a fan of country music I have to say I was a little disappointed that The Shins decided to make pop album. I was hoping for a little more twang to this one. This comes off as more of a Violent Femmes meets Oingo Boingo meets Supertramp album. It still gets four stars. 3 stars for the music and 5 for the lyrics. Check out the fourth track and 'Gone For Good'. They both get five stars for music and lyrics. If your a hard core country/western fan like myself, go out and get something by Slobberbone."
2,"Derivative, and not in a good way","There's nothing really terrible about The Shin's album, but there's nothing particularly challenging either. I can't listen to this album without thinking of the praise that's been heaped upon it, and I just don't hear it. People refer to the influences from the sixties and the band's unique take on it, but I don't hear anything that any number of bands haven't referenced before. The most striking influences I hear are all early nineties and mid-eighties: Material Issue, Modern English, etc. The record feels as though the band members sat around playing music for each other saying, ""We should do a song like this one!"" The lyrics are self-consciously clever, the album's sole grace, but not on par with Jarvis, Morrissey, or Rufus.If you're an avid music fan over the age of twenty-two, you've probably heard this done before in many permutations. Otherwise, I guess this just might be your thing. To put it bluntly, it bored me."
4,Acoustic Bliss,"This is a rocking acoustic album from start to finish, starting with the rollicking ""Kissing the Lipless"". It is stronger overall than their debut ""O Inverted World"". This band is just now hitting the radio after this CD has been out for quite a while. They deserve all the attention they get. Fun, acoustic bliss."
5,Bloody brilliant!,"The Shins' sophomore effort, Chutes Too Narrow, will make you wonder why every other band that you've listened to in the last 5 years are just horrible, horrible imposters. You'll cry for joy while they wail away on their instruments and you'll thank the gods in Heaven that music so sweet has blessed you ears for the all too short 10 songs on the album.""So Says I"" makes me feel like I got stomped on by angels. It's a materful song with great base backing the vocal tracks. ""Young Pilgrims,"" ""Saint Simon,"" both of these songs will make you want to tear your heart out because they affect such intense emotion.I cannot believe that it took me 9 months to find this album."
4,"Great Album, Unique songwriting","The Shins have a style that's difficult to describe. If you like indie rock with guitars and strong melodic lines, this album is for you. I especially appreciate the quirky and intelligent lyrics of the songs. I originally got ""Young Pilgrims"" from a friend, and had to go looking for the whole album. I'm glad I did."
4,we are a brutal kind,"At first this may come off as a step down from Oh Inverted World; while it works in the same sort of indie pop with light tinges of psychadelia of the debut, there's not really anything that will hook you in the very first listen like ""Caring Is Creepy"" or ""New Slang"" (although ""So Says I"" comes close). But the truth is it's just as good if not better than the previous album, it just needs multiple listens. The melodies, while they don't really slam your head with big obvious hooks, are impeccably strong, and there's lots of brilliant little sonic details in the arrangements, in particular the beautiful combination of overdubbed harmonies and violin that close ""Saint Simon"" and the teriffic almost Cure-like rising keyboard line in the chorus of ""Mine's Not A High Horse"". So give it a chance to grow, personally this is gradually becoming one of my favorite albums of 2003."
4,"Amphibians, too","Ten cool reptile and amphibian temporary tattoos. Last year I handed some of these out for Halloween, the kids just kept coming. ""We heard you have the tattoos!"" The yellow and green collared lizard is the best, but it's a very near thing. There's also a really neat green tree frog, a Jackson's chameleon, and a lovely eastern newt. There's an odd-looking crocodile (just the head is shown, from the front), and a disembodied iguana head, but it's probably a matter of personal taste, the neighbor kids seemed to like them all. The other creatures depicted are a red poison dart frog, a pretty blue and yellow poison dart frog, a painted turtle, and a gharial."
2,wrong colour,"The delivery was timely, however I ordered the product for someone else in a dark shale/light gold colour but a black/white shirt was sent instead."
1,The Internet site now longer exists,"This product is so old, it's from the 1990's and the part of the game you go online for no longer exists."
2,A little disappointed,A little disappointed. Really don't like the bits that say will be back after these brief messages. I'ts like they have taped it from the tv and deleted the ads. Also disappointed that the seven discs come packed on top of each other so they can get scratched easily. Other than that I have only watched 4 episodes because I'm busy and I have enjoyed those.
2,Not what i expected,"I just cooked once with it with low to medium heat and the inside bottom turned into every color in the rainbow. The Faberware people told me that it happens when it is exposed to high temperatures, and that it won't affect the quality of my food. But who wants to cook over something that looks like that and not worry about eating iron? I can even smell the rust!! And it did take a lot of greasing for things not to stick. It is my first time buying stainless steel but i am really dissapointed with this brand."
2,Nikon -not cool pics,"Have been trying several new camera's, first one was the super small Nikon credit card cam, I don't recall the # right now, it has been the best so far. This L1 simply doesn't take good pictures easily. I am a basic user, but my wife is a semi professional, highly educated camera person, and she agrees it ain't just me--she actually advocates returning this one. There is also a obnoxiously long wait for the cmaera to recharge between shots--whether with flash or without. The only thing redeeming--and why I tried this one, is that the lens actually protrudes from the camera body, making it difficult to put your finger in front of the lens. This was a major issue with the little credit card model."
2,A marginal camera at best...,"VERY slow storage even with a fast card....small but too thick for comfortable handling. I ended up selling it on ebay and buying a Canon SD600 which is a great camera, thin enough to fit in your shirt pocket, fast storage of images and the battery lasts a very long time. I've charged it once and have taken many many holiday pictures. Don't buy the Nikon without first checking out the Canon SD600."
4,great picture quality,"I love this camera based on:the great quality of pictures;good quality of vedio capture;however:it is much bigger than I have imagined from the website;the battery life is too short, a new pair of AA energizer batteries can stand only about 3 hours.this stuff need too a long time to recharge itself (about 5 seconds) and i cannot take pictures without wait, so sometimes i lost a lot of great moments."
4,Great Camera,I really like the size of the screen and quality of the pictures. It is really easy to use and the pictures turn out great. The only drawback is that there is almost no chance to take a picture without the flash except in sunlight. Without the flash you get a shakey picture. But overall the camera is exactly what I was looking for.
2,Blurred Disappointment,"I was so excited to get this camera could hardly wait to rip it out of the box and take a bazillion pictures! But my excitment was washed down the drain quickly because every photo burred w/ out the flash. And it wouldn't focus unless the flash was on. It only seems happy w. the flash on even when not nessecary, making my pictures to bright and the color horrible. I have read the manual and have to change all the settings for any hope of a good photo. Each picture shouldn't require a setting change or WB change. This camera is a pain in my butt and I wish I had gone w. something else. I applaud all who can get it to function properly!"
5,great camera with a super fast shutter speed,"I got this camera yesterday, and I am already loving it. it has way to many settings, for me to figure out how work. I love this camera."
1,Horrible Camera,"Well given the other reviews, I must have just gotten a bum camera. The shutter speed is too slow, and no matter what setting it is on, and no matter how steady my husband and I hold the camera, it takes blurry pictures. Not what we expected from a nice camera. We have had this one about 6 months and are buying a new one already."
2,Not Happy,"I tryed the Coolpix L1 6.2MP.I have never returned anything in my life,but I took this back.I could not get a clear pic.day or night,outside or inside.I have a old 1.3 megapixel camera that takes better pic.I love photography.But I could not get a good pic with this camera.I will not buy a Nikon camera again."
4,Great quality introductory level camera,"I bought this camera 3 weeks ago and have had nothing but ease in use. The camera is easy for me, a novice to digital much less normal photography, to function and take great pictures. It takes great landscape shots, and even action shots while skiing the deep powder of Montana. As for indoor photos, they look good as far as I can tell. The only trouble I've had is trying to use the detail focus functions without a tripod. In these shooting modes, the camera will notice your wobbling hands and take blurry pictures as a result. I haven't used the video feature enough, but it works well so far. For thus just getting into digital photo, this camera is awesome. Very easy to use and great quality for the price. Regardless of what other folks say, the 6 megapixels can be noticed and the detail of the pictures is beautiful."
4,Great Nikon,I have had this camera for a couple months now and it has been a great camera. I really was attracted to the black casing as well as all of the Nikon features. I have only owned Canon digital cameras in the past. But I wanted to make this switch to Nikon. I am really glad I did. The only negative I have is that it seems to go through batteries fairly quickly. But if you get a re-chargable set-up then your ok. The functions are easy to use and the pictures are outstanding. Definatly a great camera!
3,"chunky camera, average pictures","Pictures taken outdoors during the day are fine. Portraits also work out well regardless of the location as long as you have a flash. Night pictures and indoor shots are poor though. Batteries don't last long, be sure to use the lithium batteries designed for electronics."
4,Awesome Camera,"I had this camera for over three years, and it never gave me any problems in those years. Just recently it broke though, it doesn't turn on, so I just figured it was time for an upgrade since they have all new cool features on the new cameras. Nikon has always been my camera brand favorite, and I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a simple point and shoot digital camera."
4,The madness continues,"I love Jherek Carnelian and Mrs. Underwood's adventures. This is a ridiculous story, but wait til you meet Captain Mubbers and crew. A time-traveling adventure of warped chaos and discord. Not as funny as An Alien Heat, but still a fun adventure. Time will never be the same."
3,Super Reader,"Jherek Carnelian has come to understand that he is in love with Amelia Underwood. So much so that he even did some time travelling of his own because of his feelings.This travelling has caused more problems for both of them, but now Jherek must find a way to travel again."
1,pro flash,"Camera was sold as being new. It had caked on dirt on the case, the flash unit did not work, and it had a package of film in it that fell apart when you tried to remove it."
4,Came on time,I bought this book for my uncle and it came right on time before he had to travel. He has not read it yet but the condition of the book was as stated and in great condition.
5,Probably the best business book ever written,This book is that rarest of commodities....an attempt to catch the act of serious (but also playful) thinking in mid-act. Worth many reads.
4,Does what it's supposed to,Hardware is what it should be. Software is not intuitive and quite awkward to use & understand.
1,Plug and Play,This is not plug and play. You are required to go download drivers first (so says the insert in my box).This is my second of these drives and neither works. The install guide sends you to thier web site to download drivers that are not even there! Customer service is no help. Ill be returning for the second time and will not get another WD product.
4,"a vivid translation, better than the Johnny Mnemonic movie","I'm fortunate to have a copy of this. It covers the first third or so of Neuromancer. It's a shame they didn't continue it.Other William Gibson rarities and short stories at my complete bibliography/mediagraphy, http://www.slip.net/~spage/gibson/biblio.ht"
4,Fun to watch,"I always enjoy a fishing trip to the beach. There were good demonstrations and tips in such a short video. At a length of only 42 minutes the experience is over too soon. However, it is a good 42 minutes. The video opens with tips on observing the beach conditions; are there birds diving, how are the waves breaking, and are there baitfish in the breakers? ""TJ"" is the fisherman in the ""Joe and TJ"" team. There is a brief survey of type of equipment (rods, reels, line weight). There is a good, easy to follow demonstration of putting together a surf rig. A very brief demonstration of cast netting for finger mullet and demonstration of a single way of hooking up the mullet. There was no discussion of other types of excellent surf baits nor how to acquire them yourself nor how to properly hook them. I enjoyed this video but it left me wanting more."

1,Save your money..,"I've used this crap for a year but gave it up. Had really odd dreams, developed sleep apnea while taking this stuff. When I stopped taking it I now sleep much better without the apnea and snoring.Get some exercise and eat balanced meals and you won't need this garbage."
3,good or bad service?,"This is a gift my friend asked me to buy it for her. But it really took a long time to deliver. At least 20 days, I didn't hear any information and later I found the tracking number is totally wrong. So I had to contact them about the situation. What the most interesting thing is, after I email them about the problem, they sent me a overnight deliver so I got the package at the second day.So, it is really hard for me to say whether they are good or bad. But I am sure if they can deliver the stuff to me earlier I will praise them certainly."
1,Waste of money,"I totally agree with [a negative reviewer]. I was very disappionted after waiting so long for the release. The authur constantly repeated things, trying to make the book longer. Plus Tucker seems to have a grudge against Joshua Chamberlain. In the last chapter he makes it sound like Chamberlain had nothing to do with the battle and lied about his contribution afterwards. He provdes no maps to prove his ""research"". He also states the 15th Alabama retired up Big Round Top after the battle. But wasn't Big Round Top in Union hands after the 2nd day? There's many things I didn't like about this book."
2,Significantly Different than actual PE Problems,"I took the WR afternoon session and the questions in the test were nothing of the magnitude in this book. The problems in this book were WAY harder than the actual PE. While studying with this book, I was constantly frustrated by not making the same assumptions the author did in order to solve a problem. No assumptions on the PE, mind you, other than standard weights, measures, etc. Get the sample problems from NCEES instead - very much worth the money!"
1,Not worth it.,Was not the slam-dunk study tool I'd hoped. I would not recommend this book. Just use sample exams from NCEES to study with.
1,Yukky Old Descriptive notation despite recent publication,"I returned it right away. If you don't mind the old descriptive notation feel free to check it out.I thought anything with a 1997 publication date would surely use algebraic notation, but I got fooled.For those that wonder: What is descriptive notation? P-K4 means White's pawn to e4 and P-K4 also means Black's pawn to e5. Same notation for two different moves..."
3,a book more worthy than worthwhile,"vollmann's afghanistan book is surely his weakest, but it is a useful window on the author's life and some themes that run through his fiction. it is at times tedious and over-thought (the style is two parts personal history, one part philosophizing). but after all, the book is largely about the inability of a thoughtful young man to apply his high-minded idealism in a practical way, so a little wittgenstein here and there can be appropriate. overall, vollmann's story is sadly poignant, but you have to be able to sympathize with his earnestness and altruism from the get-go. otherwise, you'll probably just get aggravated or bored."
5,"A GREAT AUTHOR, THE BOOK IS GOOD TOO","Louis Sachar is a great author, and ""Jonny in the basement"" is good too. Not his best, but it is excellent. I'd have to congratulate Louis for all his success. Congratulations! And to anyone who wants to read this, do, it's a good book."
3,Tea Anyone?,"I received my Green Chantal Teakettle today. What a beautiful looking kettle. Probably one of the nicer looking kettles around. I understand that the metal handle will get too hot to touch. I did not have a problem with the handle at all. I have an electric stove. However, I thought the lever for the spout was hot to the touch. As for the whistle, it was loud. My husband thought the whistle was our fire alarm going off."
4,"Good Hardware, Bad software","Good item , it was impossible to purchase cable in Israel , only by Amazon , but attached software is old version and it is impossible to use it. Need to download program from Suunto site"
5,PattiPat,"This older booklet shares knowledge of how to play music for yourself...taking out the mysteries that could be holding back an adult. It clearly introduces the reader to concepts and guides through details. Only through Amazon.com would I be able to find such a wonderful item from long ago, yet current in its presentation and teaching methods."
4,A Pretty Good Bird Reference Book,"If you love birds, you may want to add this book to your collection. Clearly it is not a field guide: too heavy and bulky. It does, however, contain a great deal of information that will help in the never ending quest to find and identify another bird. Each bird listed has a section on song, behavior, breeding habits, nesting, population, and conservation. Flight patterns, nest identification, and habitat are also described iconically. Good range maps are included. The ""photos"" will not help much in identifying birds, but a complementary guide such as Sibley's can fill in the gap nicely. Place this book on your coffee table, open it often to learn another tidbit about one of those birds you haven't yet seen, and I don't think it will be disappointing."
5,Birds of North America:Life Histories of More Than 930 species,"If you just started birdwatching, or are even the occasional ""What's this in my garden?"" this book will last you a lifetime. It's amazing."
5,Birds of North America,The book is one of the best bird books. The condition of the book was not as it was described. The cover was either chewed up by a teething dog or child. The company was very good to credit me so I am happy .
4,Pax is mostly cool.,"This is a really good empire building game and being able to play a game of this complexity in real time is really new and fun. However, the game does suffer on the combat screens, it's difficult to control your fleets and comabts can be painfully long and frequent. And computer AI can be pretty stupid, however you can play multiplayer Mac vs. PC which is really cool. It is also fairly easy to manage your empire when it grows to a large size, where games like Civ II begin to bog down. This game is very addictive and you can play it for hours and hours at a time."
4,"Cute, fun, but wish there were more","The noodles themselves are, I think, a fine size. Another reviewer said they were the size of uncooked macaroni - which I disagree with. I'd say they're about 2/3rds the size of the noodles they represent. They have wonderful detail & color and, like almost all Haba toys, they're very durable: provided I can keep track of them, I can tell they'll last a long time. I was kinda bummed that so few come in one bag: each bag has 32 pieces - which is enough to fill my hand, or one toy plate. I did buy two bags, though, and I think that'll be enough for playtime."
5,Play Pasta,"I have a play kitchen my grandkids love...this was a new addition and again another hit. Sturdy, colorful and has the look of real pasta. Keep away from little ones who are still putting things in their mouths. Would have preferred it came in a can like some of their other products, but all in all, great product."
5,Book centers on the role of guard cavalry in the Roman army,"Spiedel draws on a variety of source materials to give us a view of the role of gaurd cavalry in the overall Roman military system. What this reader sees as being of greatest value in the book, are the generally reasonable conclusions Spiedel offers concerning the evolving ethnic makeup of the gaurd cavalry units at certain times in the history of their existence, and the consequent ability of those units to function as a part of the Roman army. This aspect of Spiedel's work is particularly important in light of the fact that any history of Roman gaurd units must have something to say about the political context within which they originated and operated. A good and reasonable series of conclusions given the relative dearth of primary written materials."
3,"A good work, but is totally exaggerated the usefulness of this riders","The author express his praise for the work done by the imperial horse guards, as if they were very effective in their work, but the reality is very different. A very large number of rome emperors were killed by the praetorian guard or the army, and in none of these cases the Germani Corpores Custodi or later the Equites Singulares Augusti could prevent the killings. So their work were not very good."
2,"Inconvenient, sloppy and just not worth it.","A semi-hard case should give you the ability to quickly get the camera out of your bag, strip off the cover and take a picture all in one swift motion. This is NOT so with this case. I had to struggle with the base that holds the camera to the cover. It got to a point that I had to just take out the base and just use the cover. Even then, the cover is not designed to be removed very quickly. I wanted one that you can strip off with one swift motion. This was not what I got. Instead the locks and velcro openings were located where I had to turn the camera around several times to uncover it.Please, don't get this if you're looking for a no-hassle cover. It's almost as inconvenient as a hard cover box - except this case doesn't protect the camera as much. What was the designer thinking?I was going to give it a single star, but it's saving feature is it's looks. It's sleek and low-profiled.- johnny -"
1,This is only the net.... no frame,I was duped into buying this thinking it was an entire lacrosse goal like the picture shows. It is only the net for $94.00... what a rip-off.
1,cute but not durable,the leather color is very thin and scrapes off easily. Shoes looked old after wearing only three times. Surprisingly low quality for Donald Pliner.
5,Chapstick is always great!,"I use Chapstick every single day because my lips tend to get dry quickly. Of all the lip balms I've used, I have to say Chapstick is the best. You would think that 24 is too many, but it's really convenient to leave one at the desk, by the bed, one in each purse, in the bathroom, in the living room, everywhere! This is the same Chapstick they sell in stores, super great, can't live without it!I bought this on Nov. 3, 2011 for $19.58 + subscribe&save; + prime"
1,"ONLY ONE, and very tiny","Looks more like a zuchinni, only one, despite the photo and the name of the item (cucumberS). About the same size as a beginner crayon."
1,they leak,"We bought a few of these together and several of them have leaked ink and badly. What more is there to say? Get those pilot g2 gelwriters instead. They're overpriced, but worth it. Or maybe there's something else out there that writes elegantly like these do before they start leaking!"
4,What I've been looking for,"Now I will grant you that this isn't the prettiest pen...but it works great! The ink truly is waterproof and fade resistant ( I tried), it writes smoothly with no skips or scratches. A little cushion around the grip would be a nice addition. Too bad it's not refillable."
3,Nice but runs out of ink fast,"I bought a pack of these when starting my residency. So I do write a lot, but these pens last me about 1 week...that's it. Writes pretty smooth although on some surfaces, it scratches. Other than short life, they are nice pens."
2,Remember Them Better,"I have gone out of my way to use these specific pens for the last ten years. I like them because my handwriting is significantly better than with a normal Bic ballpoint. However, they seem to have their problems. The ink flow is not smooth on a lot of papers I've used. Even brand new pens seem to write faint, like they're running low on ink. They also run out of ink quickly, faster than I'd ever expect. I use them for note-taking in college level classes and they are annoying to write with. These Micro tips are too fine. Too thin. The Fine tip is too thick and smeary. The pen search continues."
4,Blue took my nephews to school,"I gave this in December to my 4 year old nephews, and they loved it. On a G4/500 running OS 10.3.5, it didn't take long to load, and ran well (you do need to keep the CD in, although a disk image might work). My nephews have always liked to draw, and they spent most of their time in the art module (20 colors, 3 brushes, an airbrush, ""stickers"", eraser, and coloring book). The music module didn't seem very good; it appears to be about matching rhythms. The ""water table"" boat puzzles were also popular. The nature module got some attention, but even at 4 years old, they knew a lot of it. They played as long as they were allowed, and their parents report that several weeks later, they were still eagerly playing."
3,Something Different,"After buying Born To Be With You/Streetheart,and playing it many times,I felt I had to check out this CD.Sit Down Old Friend/You're Not Alone is quite different from Born To Be With You/Streetheart.It's overall sound is quieter.You mostly hear the sound of a guitar.Especially in Sit Down Old Friend,where Dion only used a guitar for background music.He did good renditions of Beatles songs Let It Be and Blackbird."
4,My Baby Sam Vintage Floral Bedding,"Overall, I love this bedding. It is a soft pink. The material isn't the greatest, but it isn't bad. The crib sheet isn't as soft as I would prefer. The blanket is bigger than a standard crib mattress and fits awkwardly in the crib. Plus, again the material isn't the softest that I want against my baby's skin. So in summary, I love the colors and design of the product, but the material is not snuggly enough for my baby."
5,"This one is a ""no brainer""...","How about putting out a disc with 24 songs by America's greatest lyricists of the 20th century? Hey, how about if we make it two dozen songs that Frank Sinatra, the greatest male pop singer of the century, loved and recorded in great performances? And get this: Let's have Tony Bennett, arguably the second-best male pop singer in a hundred years of the recorded music industry, and who was called by Sinatra himself ""my favorite singer"" do the new versions. Wait, even better---we'll let the Ralph Sharon jazz trio, Tony's favorites for 40 years provide the beat for him. Why stop there? Let's price the darn thing reasonably, as well. Any Sinatra or Tony fan, music history fan, or bargain lover who does not buy this one is cheating him or herself."
3,Tony,"I LOVE Tony Bennett, but wasn't thrilled with this one. If you want to try one of his better releases try Playing With My Friends and the one with K.D. Lang both great. His older CDs are great, but of the latest, these two are far better."
2,"Oh, man, what a disaster!","I am a big time movie buff; a good animated movie is hard to come by these days, but I look forward to them. However, this is not what I call, ""good entertainment."" The Heathcliff cartoon was the best with Iggy and Grandpa Nutmeg, and Mongo, and who could forget that opening song....""Heathcliff, Heathcliff, no one should...tearing by the neighborhood..."" Anyway, all this movie is - is three of THE ABSOLUTE WORST Heathcliff cartoons combined, with Heathcliff sitting around torturing his nephews one rainy afternoon. I mean, c'mon, man, at least they could've found three better episodes to pack into this 70 minute piece of garbage..."
1,Don't buy!,"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I went against my better judgment and bought the game. First because I loved the Worms games on PC and i was looking for a good stragety game. Big mistake! The biggest problem with this game is the worms on the screen are so small and it's very difficult to see where they are. Everything is squished together and it's not worth straining your eyes just to find your worm or the opponent. Please, if you're looking for a good Worms game, stick with PC. The DS screen is too small."
3,Worms DS 1.0,Physics and AI suck and there aren't many weapons. Either than that it's just standard worms.
3,Not very complete and not very inspiring,"I am not an English native speaker. Just because of that, sometimes I am badly in need of some alternative word to better express an idea or, simply, not to incur in ""faux amis"" pitfalls. In this regard, this dictionary is only average. I found myself looking many times for a word in it that it does not list or does list but presents synonyms which are well known and sometimes even obvious. For example, I couldn't find the word ""conflate"" in this dictionary, as well as dozens of other not-so-exotic words. Cross-referencing is also only average.A handy reference---three stars---, but I would guess there are (or at least there should be!) more complete and cross-referenced dictionaries of synonyms out there."
5,Teacher & Engineering,"Although I have given 5 stars, I would like to see the computer version. If you have not had any dictionary regarding synomyms, I would recommend you to have it."
1,Don't DO IT!!!,"Pass!!!! Thirteen minutes into this movie and I wanted to stab the two lead characters in the head, and I am NOT a child of the corn!!!The lead characters are nice to look at, but the ""wife"" bitched so much that the Dali Lama would want to punch her in the kisser, and the ""husband"" was a reactive putz. I could not fathom how the two ended up married unless it was a rejected ""Friends"" episode!I wouldn't bother watching this movie unless you lose a bet."
1,Should have followed the original,"I received the original COTC for Christmas and still was a real enjoyable movie. I had forgotten about one of the first scares (when the kid was run down) and I still jumped. In watching the featurettes I heard the producer or director speaking of a remake. So I searched in Amazon and ordered. I think the producers should've followed the original instead of the re-write. What a boring movie. I fell asleep and had to rewind to see if I missed anything, but what I missed made me fall asleep again. The producers missed the mark. This ""re-imagination"" is a dud."
3,Not what I expected,The movie came in a cheap little case with no cover. I had to make a case and cover for the movie to go on the shelves with my other ones. They need to let people knoe the movies will not be in cases.
2,Too much left unexplained,"I liked Preston Bailey as Isaac and some of the cornfield shots, but the rest of this is a mess: the woman is so annoying that you just want her dead, her husband has Vietnamm flashbacks, the kids' twisted theology is never explained, and neither is the fate of their parents and all the other adults who must have once lived in Gatlin."
3,SCREAMED CORN,"What do you do when your supposed heroes are really detestable--and you can't wait for them to get killed? But then you can't root for the demonic kids either? The only sympathetic character is the poor dog who collapses on the street!Although a Stephen King fan, this story has never been one of my favorites. I saw the 1984 original but don't remember much about it.This version suffers from Preston Bailey's atrocious Isaac--he is as terrifying as a slug. Even though the bickering couple are annoying as hell, David Anders and Kandyce McClure portray them with conviction.I think this is one King work that needs to be put to rest."
3,"Reasonably well done, but nothing special","First, I'm not necessarily convinced that Children of the Corn needed to be remade. The original wasn't half bad, and the 80's capabilities proved a good match to the nuances of the story. This remake, also, isn't half bad. Its a pretty faithful retelling of the famous story, done in what feels more higher budget and better production with obviously newer technologies. The acting is decent, and the camera work is as well. If you're a huge fan of the original, you might enjoy this."
1,Children Of The Bore tonight on SyFy!,"Watched this on SYFY. Pointless remake that comes not even close to Stephen Kings Classic!80% of this movie is the Husband/Wife ""complaining/crying"" and fighting with each other! Terrible casting here. They are suppose to be married come on! Just Dumb from the beginning to the horrible ending.This movie leaves you wanting more? More what? Corn on the cob? Terrible remake! I can't believe I spent this much time writing this review! Big Disappointment!Please don't buy this. It doesn't deserve your money! Spend your money on the HILLS RUN RED or a bag of frozen/canned corn instead of this piece of crap!!!!!!!!"
4,my favorite,"Love these pens. They are skinnier than most, fairly long-lasting, and (mostly) a joy to use. [But one star off because back in the day when you could get gobs of them in a package at Costco for not very much, there would be an occasional clinker that never really worked quite right, and some that didn't seem to last very long, etc.] Mistakenly bought a box of the ""FINE"" version of this pen a few months ago, and although they're not too bad, they're just a bit less skinny (can sort of deal), but they definitely write too thick for me. So here I am trying to find my ""MICRO""s, as I'm down to my last one..."
5,Great Pens,I have used these pens for years and was greatly relieved when I found them at Amazon.com. Would recommend them to anyone who prefers an untra fine point on a pen.
4,"good pen, ok price",This is the only pen my husband will write with. He doesn't particularly like ball points not felt tip and this is a combo of both. The microtip is great for writing in small spaces.
1,"Loved these for 16 years, now they're worthless.","The uni-ball micro rollers were the only pen I used for about 16 years, and I loved them. I always have a few in every backpack, coat, desk, and car. They were smooth and dark and writing with them made me feel smart and creative.And now, they're worthless.I just ordered two new boxes, which is my usual behavior whenever I find there aren't a few immediately at hand in the usual locations. The box now has a ""helps prevent check fraud"" label. Indeed, I don't imagine anyone can commit check fraud with PENS THAT DON'T WORK.The ink is not as dark, it doesn't flow as well when they are working, and they STOP WORKING ENTIRELY and scratch emptily across the page within 5 minutes of writing.So I just angrily threw both new boxes in the garbage. I'm not upset about the wasted $16, I'm upset that now, after so many loyal years, I have to find a new brand."
3,Lacking texture.,"Although the pens have done up to their expectations for this pricepoint, they lack in overall reliably. Sometimes, when using these pens, they skip every few inches in ink."
2,These ain't the same!,"The last two times I bought a two-box supply of my favorite pen, the 60151 Uniball Roller, they have been terribly disappointing. They write beautifully as usual, but they only do that for a few days. After that they begin to skip, write pale-ly, the tip must be turned just so to get the ink to flow, and have to be tossed long before their time. I used these pens for years at work and they lasted for weeks. What happened? I can only assume that the ones I bought the last two or three times from Amazon had been sitting on someone's forgotten shelf for years before being put up for sale. I hope the new order I just placed will be more like what I was used to, once upon a time."
4,Classics.,Got this for my mother for Christmas a few years ago. Classic Christmas songs that everyone enjoys. Would definitely recommend.
4,Good Album,I like Neil Diamond and I like this album. It is a nice blend of Christmas music. I bought it specifically for the song You Make It Feel Like Christmas. I gave it to my wife.
1,Unbelievable......,I'm sorry even though Neil is one of the Giants of Rock and Pop; his christmas renditions on thisalbum are awful. He murders White Christmas and Santa Claus is coming to town. Some people are meant to do a christmas album but Mr. Diamond is not one of them. His Ego got the best of him by recording this album.
5,"O Come, O Come Emmanuel/ We Three Kings Of Orient Are - A must-have Christmas Album!","The medley 'O Come, O Come Emmanuel/ We Three Kings Of Orient Are' is my favorite album track. Neil Diamond's unique timbre makes this Christmas album a must-buy. Yes! ... it is worth purchasing yet another cover of 'Little Drummer Boy' and 'Silver Bells'!I also recommend the 'companion CD'Christmas Album 2as well as Neil Diamond's latest Christmas CDA Cherry Cherry Christmas- now at a bargain price!I give all three Neil Diamond Christmas albums a perfect 5 STAR rating!"
1,Neil Or Fruitcake?,"Just do not throw this thing into the fireplace. CDs, when burnt, let off toxic fumes."
1,Doesn't anyone think it's strange??,"Doesn't anyone think it's a little hypocritical of a Jewish man to sing Christmas songs? I love Neil Diamond's music, and but the idea of any Christmas songs from him makes me shake my head in bewilderment."
2,Christmas at the lounge,"Neil takes on Christmas with over emotional vocals and covers artists whose originals are far superior to his takes on the tunes. This was not a good idea. Lennon's ""Happy Christmas?"" ""Silver Bells"" with a country twang. (Did he listen to the lyrics?) The best tunes are his one contribution (""You Make It Feel Like Christmas"") and a few old chestnuts that really resist major damage (""Jingle Bell Rock"" ""Little Drummer Boy"") I was surprised it took Neil this long to put out a Christmas CD. It wasn't worth the wait."
1,One star for the unintentional humor.,"Truly God-awful - a joke in every way! This man's voice is gone, and he has no feel for classic Christmas songs. His talking during ""Silver Bells"" (""...ringing on every street corner in the city!"") and his dreadful ""I-yi-yi-yi'm dreaming of a White Christmas"" (Ay-yi-yi indeed!) are so bad they're good - my friends and I play these songs and laugh our heads off. One other writer said, ""Just buy the CD and stop thinking."" Stop thinking is the operative term here - Neil wasn't thinking when he recorded this, and anyone who buys this swill willingly has to turn their brain off first. Ghastly!"
1,"I listened to this once, and I'm already ready to sell it","Hey ""Gretlcello"" from the ""middle of Kansas"". You are exactly right on your review for this disaster of a Christmas cd by Neil Diamond. He should be jailed for ruining these Christmas classics like he did here. I looked at my mom and she looked at me, and we both said this is garbage! I don't mind him being a jew and singing Christmas songs, if he could sing them correctly, but this is totally ridiculous. Hey ""Gretlcello"" I like your taste in cello and classical music. I'm not a cello player, but I like recordings of the instrument, and you have really good taste, but stop listening to Josh Groban and Kenny G! Okay! I guess we're the only ones who know that you should stay away from Christmas albums by Mr.Diamond.P.S. I've just heard Neil's Vol.II Christmas album, and it's much more enjoyable than this first volume, so I guess Neil can do an okay Christmas album."
1,A diamond in the dirt! ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!,"I've been a fan of Neil Diamond for quite some time, but after listening to music samples and hearing some of his Christmas works on the radio around the holiday season, I can simply say that Mr. Diamond has no right to produce a holiday album if he can't take an old fashioned song and sing it as it should be done. This album made me want to spit out my egg nog everytime I hear his own version of my favorite Christmas tunes. Don't waste your money on this album!"
2,Not for the serious Eagles fan/guitarist,"This book doesn't faithfully reproduce the music as played by the band. Instead, each song features a chord progression and the lead part simply ""tracks"" the song's vocals as if your desire was to replace the vocals with guitar (ala Muzak). A complete waste of money and time for any guitarist who is an Eagles fan."
1,SuperTab Notation = NOT,This is complete garbage. I have seen better eagles tab on OLGA. Am E Em C D Dm = thats pretty much the entire book. I wasted my hard earned cash on it don't waste yours.For RealXomnian
3,Calicore!,"Not a bad little slab of California hardcore. Not something I usually expect from the west coast, it has more of an east coast feel with it's heavy guitars and throaty, growling vocals. However, some of the riffs are your stereotypical ""hardcore"" riffs, but all in all the abulm comes together well. My only other problem with this album is the production, the vocals are mixed to high and sometimes tend to overpower the guitar and drums. All in all I say this wouldn't be a bad addition to anyone's collection."
5,unconditionally love this cd.,This cd and UNCONDITIONAL LOVE are two of the best modern albums from Peabo Byrson.
4,Okay cd,"The song ""Treat her like a lady"" will take you back to the Peabo of the late 70's. Not his best cd, but it's pretty darn good and Treat...is a great Peabo song...too bad he never performs it in concert..go figure."
5,Cool,"This is a very good game. The graphics are great, the simulation is great, the action is great, and it's fun to play. Since I'm only 11, this game gets frustrating, and there's cusswords in it. Other than that, this is a great game for people who like the historic airplanes."
3,WW I Flying Fun,"For the most part, the World War I scenario is well put together and is a fairly challenging game. One moves their way up the ranks as skill and daringness prevail. The graphics do not do Xbox justice, but are okay. My only real gripe is that there is only one view as you fly the airplane (as if you are just behind the plane, or as the game says, ""flying machine""). I would rather have a cockpit view while flying... Incidentally, a realistic perspective is offered while manning various machine-guns - go figure. Overall the game deserves a chance to match skill and wits with the enemy!"
1,NEVER GOT MY GAME HELP,never got it and still whateing for it it was the game i was trying to get this game from blockbuster
2,Too old for a decent grade,"Theres not a large group of flying games that get a good rating, and this game is one. Back in its day, it might have been all the rave, but now its just cheesey. Graphics are outdated. The overall gameplay aint bad, theres lots to do. Theres many more games out there with much better graphics and are much more fun. But, if you've tried all the others and want more, get it, [...]"
4,Excellent compact.,"This is an excellent device. Great image quality. If mine had not somehow been afflicted with dust/tiny hairs on the sensor I'd still be using it. Fuji says they will attempt a fix for $150 but do not guarantee the outcome. The only thing I think will replace it is a Panasonic LX5 - that's how good this pioneering camera is. (The newer F series Fujis are, for me, a bit too small.)"
4,Excellent ultra-low-noise ISO3200 CCD makes up for all flaws,"There's a lot to not like about this camera: it seems bulkier than it should be, it uses a proprietary memory card, the camera doesn't mount as a flash drive when you plug it into your computer (buy aLexar Single-USB Reader), the menu system and user interface needs some polish, and it lacks some of the more advanced manual controls.So why do I recommend this camera to everyone I meet? It's all about the CCD. Fuji decided not to fight the megapixel war, started engineering for low-noise, and completely knocked it out of the park with the F30 and its successor the F31. In low-light conditions this camera takes better pictures than any compact camera I've used. You get three to four stops more exposure before you need to start using a flash. Perfect for dimly lit nightclubs, resturants, bars, and concerts - the occasions where most compact cameras are used."
3,Malfuctioned after two weeks of moderate use.,"I purchased the new FinePix F31 fd digital camera on 11/30/2006 and received it about a week later. This camera was purchased to replace a Canon A-85 and was to have been used to take digital photos for the Christmas Season. After about two weeks of moderate use, the camera's shutter release would not work. I tried every troubleshooting suggestion in the manual and from your website, but could not get it to work. Needless to say, my wife and I were extremely disappointed that we would not be able to use the camera during the Holiday Season and that we would have to drive 60 miles from New Haven to Precision Camera Repair in Enfield, CT for repair."
1,I will never buy Fuji again,"During the warranty period, the power button malfunctioned. We sent the camera in for repair, but Fuji insisted that we damaged it. They forced us to pay $85. A couple years later, the same issue occurred -- the power button malfunctioned again. We sent it back to Fuji, and they want another $85 to fix the SAME problem, even though we did not drop or damage the camera. This is just ridiculous. When we called them, Fuji responded that it doesn't matter how many times the same item malfunctions and they repair it, they will charge us.Forget Fuji. I'm going back to Canon."
3,The wording is confusing!,"I have to say that the overall quanlity of this book is good, but it too relies on lenghty (sometimes technical) explanation. I suggest readers dont try to figure out every sentance meaning in this book and do try to read more examples, since you will find out you never figure out the meaning of those words unless you become a java expert. The examples in this book are well written and easy to follow."
1,Experienced programmer DOWNGRADES this book,"I currently work at Symantec Corporation in Santa Monica. I have been programming in C and C++ for 5 years now, and I started learning JAVA by buying this book. I would have to say that this book is extremely NOT CONCISE and difficult to follow. I was only barely able to follow it because of my experience in C++ programming, but I'm pretty sure that if I were to read this book about a year ago, I would NOT be able to understand a thing. It is very INDIRECT to the point. If you want a good understanding of JAVA, go to the tutorial website provided by the makers themselves (Sun Microsystems)."
1,Do the Java world a favor - Ignor this book,Reading a chapter from this book before buying it should convince you that there is a good reason for all the bad reviews. I'm glad I did.
5,The ideal intro to the mechanics of Java programming,"This was the course text at my college and was, by far, the most valuable thing I gained from my class. An ideal introduction to the novice Java programmer. I came from a C background and found this book was perfectly pitched to my needs. The examples are well dissected and introduce peripheral programming style tips as a painless bonus to the syntactical explanations. An excellent first book to buy on the language, though it should be noted that Swing is not covered in this edition (2nd). A third edition will be available in the next coupla months, I hear. So, if you can wait..."
2,"It should be called - Java ""What I did"" Program","I'm a Computer Science student and this has been my textbook for Fall '98 & Spring '99. It has many examples and lots of verbiage but it doesn't explain ""Why"" -- the logic behind the programs' design. As a future programmer, I don't want to just memorize algorithms. I want to know how to design my own algorithms and I need to understand the ""Why"" of the programs' logic.My teacher is very good so I think I am getting something out of this course. But hopefully they'll change the textbook for future classes."
1,Unfit for any reader,"This book's sheer weight and high price might fool some people into thinking it's something really worthwhile. It isn't.I tend to look at computer books as tutorials or references.As a tutorial: This book begins with Java variations on the obligatory ""Hello, World."" Instead of a step-by-step progression, however, the author then jumps directly into a combination of labels, text boxes, and listeners. What was the author thinking? Most students will be overwhelmed and switch to another book by the end of Chapter 1.As a reference: Despite this book's weight and price, there is no coverage of advanced topics like JavaBeans or Swing. Experienced programmers won't be referring to it very often.This book fails both as a tutorial and as a reference. It is a complete waste of money."
1,This book is a complete waste of money!!!,"If I could give this book zero stars, I would. Why you ask? Well, RTTI is among the MANY topics this book neglects to mention. Okay, so they had one sentence on it -- a lot of help that did. Oh, and how about using clone() with vectors. You won't find any of that timesaving information in here... and that's just the beginning. This book is organized so poorly that it's very time consuming to find exactly what you're looking for... again, if it's even in the book.Eventually, I had to get another book, ""Thinking in Java"" by Bruce Eckel, it burries this book, it's cheaper, and the award-winning author makes available a free electronic version on his web site."
2,"Good programming tips,poor structure!NOt for beginners.","I almost finished this book.After trying couple simple projects,I found it is hard to refer.The authors didn't mension many details.The spirits of JAVA are the OO usages,the OO-concepts in this book are ver weak. I don't think the authors are good at JAVA programming.However the software engineering tips are helpful.Because of lacking good structurein inside,I don't recommend beginners buy this book."
1,Not a good book for a beginner,"As my first contact with Java this book was used as my textbook. What a poor choice made by my professor when so many good ones are out there. The book is poorly written and not well-organized. For example, so much information on Java programming was poured out in chapter one before readers had any ideas what Java was. Then it kept telling readers that ""such such"" information will be given in later chapters. A good text book should be written in such a way that a little bit more information will be intoduced and expanded gradually chapter by chapter."
1,"NOT good, based upon experience","I have several years experience as a Senior Technical Training Specialist on government and private contracts. This book is poorly written, poor layout, and difficult to use for a beginner. It cannot be used as stand-alone text, but requires instructor intervention and other documentation. The first chapter attempts to introduce AWT and and other classes beyond the scope of a beginner. The summary for the first chapter is 4 pages long. Too much! This textbook is for a Beginning Java class at Valencia, and for those students who have little or no knowledge of HTML, C language, and/or any OOP development application, will find this textbook very difficult to master."
1,The worst!,This is perhaps the worst test book I ever read in my life. The examples are bad and the explanations are inadequate. You need to read some other text books to do the exercizes at the end of the chapters. This is the book for you if want to start hating Java. They can't even give a decent index at the end of book. I am sorry that I can't give less than the one star I gave for this book.
1,Really bad book! Even 'Teach Yourself ...' books are better,"Authors don't understand Java, OO programming or how to explain something concisely. These 5-star reviews have got to be fake. I agree with a previous reviewer that this book promotes ""bad programming and bad programmers."" If you buy this book, and you are just getting ""deiteled""."
1,This book does not work as a beginner's textbook,"I am currently an assistant teacher for an Intro to Programming course using Java and this is the textbook we have been using for the class. What a nightmare! Examples using applets, AWT components, and event handling - all in the first Chapter! The book is dense, with lots of information being thrown at you at once. Classes from the Java Library are introduced on a piecemeal basis, with only the methods used in the examples discussed. I would not recommend it for classroom use."
2,Save your money,"If you have read any of Deitel and Deitel's other books (C++ HTP, C HTP), you should skip this one. Much of the text is copied word for word from their other books. This book is definitely written for those with little or no programming experience. If you are already familiar with C++ and merely want to learn the syntax and features of Java, save your money. This book claims to cover version 1.1 of the JDK, yet it says little or nothing about many important aspects of 1.1 (JavaBeans, RMI, SQL). Look at Java in a Nutshell from O'Reilly or the Core Java books by Sun instead."
2,Terrible Indexing,"This book has terrible indexing just like any other book by deitel and deitel. You can never find anything you want. Unless you have absolutely no prior programming experience, this book is wasting your money."
4,Great JAVA book for neophytes!,"This book isn't for experienced programmers, but for the rest of you( that's you ): This is a book you want. With a dated, textbook-like look, it'll cover all the basics, with complete explanations as you read on"
5,Best for Programmer and Developer,"I saw mixed review for this book and that only makes sense. This book is not for extreme starter or novice gurus. Yet this book almost covers every aspect of Java Programming. This is good not only for programmer but for developers as well. You can make this book the complete authority and Deitel brothers(?) have done it again after scoring the C++. They could have made the book more intuitive and easy to follow, though. They should have given more preferences to Util api than awt."
1,"java, How to program","quite frankly, this book is not well suited to those first learn programming or those who already know programming. It does not teach you how to program at all. Everything seems to be done in applets and is also a poor reference manual for those you do know how to program"
1,Should be titled ..... Java - We can scare you away,"Bad bad book...... I ""had"" to spend $58 on this junk as it was required by the College I was learning Java at. I dropped out the course because, the book, coupled with the Instructor referencing the book, made Java look absolutely impossible.""How to Program"" implies, we can help you learn this stuff. Well, in this case it isn't true. As a novice at anything, you need in-depth explanations, you just don't get them here. Also, as a novice, you need examples that are ""precise"", well layed out, easy to follow and explained step by step. I honestly wouldn't recommend this title to anyone ......I'm sorry to be so negative but, I HAD to buy this book and I'm pretty angry that the college I was at didn't do an in-depth review of this book themselves.OPEN NOTE to AMAZON: You really need a 0 (ZERO) star option here."
1,Not a Book For Someone Who's Just Learning How To Program,"My professor, for some weird reason, selected this book to teach an Introductory Programming course in University...bad idea. The book is simply not designed to help the beginner. Furthermore, the examples provided are really not useful in understanding the concepts. If you're a beginner like I am, avoid buying this book."
3,Not for everyone,"You may be amazed to find that while many readers gave the book a 5 star rating, others gave it a 1 star rating. Be not. This book is not for everyone. While the authors claim this is a book for novice, I don't think any real novice can benefit from this book. You better have previous exposure to OO programming. But then, you probably will find the authors spent too much time explaining trivial things: common programming errors are not common at all, dumb programming errors might be a better summary; those performance tips are trivial, etc, etc. This book is not a good textbook, it is not a good book for self-study either. However, if you are somewhat experienced in programming, and you are patient, that is, you do not mind spending a little time on trivial suggestions, you will probably find it an easy reading. Meanwhile, you can learn Java the easy way from the book."
1,If you really want to learn JAVA - don't consider this book!,"If you are interested in learning JAVA from the git-go and you are not a programmer by trade; this book is of little use. The authors assume that you know C++ and can follow that methodology without further references. The examples in the book are of little to no use in answering the questions at the end of each chapter. If you are a teacher and wish to waste your students time and money - pick this book. Otherwise, find a better publication. The University of Cincinnati CAS selected this book as required for a Network Graphical Programming course and from a poll of the studends taking the course - most dislike this book and find it of little use."
1,This book is confusing,"I use this book as a text book in my graduate course. I have to get other Java books to understand Java. This book tries to make people learn Java but it is really confusing and descriptions are too short and not clear. For first time Java programmer, it is not a good book at all."
2,"Learn java on 58 dollars. Student in Ottawa, Canada ($89 ca)","Java will one day be the standard programing language around the would. So it is important to have a strong base when being introduced to into java, The deitel brothers should take a course in basic java. The book is very vage on problem questions in the back of every chapter and if the professer is inexperienced then good luck. Don't let the price tag fool you, look around ask question and avoid his mistake."
2,"Bad index, no syntax, and hard to read. Look elsewhere","This book is too hard to read to be effective. The text is littered with words in bold, meant to point out Java keywords, statements, and filenames, but which actually distract the eye. The text has plenty of examples, but basic syntax and explanations of usage and parameters are just not there. I have looked in the index countless times for methods that I need explanations for and found most every time that I am referred to some random mention of the method, written in bold, buried in some paragraph somewhere where it doesn't seem to have any purpose. If I seriously need Java help for what I'm learning in my classes, I turn to another book."
3,Inconsistent Results,"It appears that the Deitel Series of ""How To"" books leaves some users singing praises and others scorning it. I'm dead in the middle on this issue.I am one of the many who went and bought another book, both for the C++ and Java.A good solid understanding of the basics in each language seems to make the Deitel Series more bearable. In fact, this series often shines when you introduce a topic with another text and then turn to the Deitels."
1,This book does not serve its purpose.,"If you are thinking to buy this book, let me tell you that please think again. This book does not serve its purpose. From the beginning itself Deitel gives very superficial information about elements of JAVA ignoring the core. If it tends to teach JAVA, how can fundamentals be ignored."
3,A little confusing,"I have to disagree with the others here. Deitel and Deitel's first program in this book is dozens of lines of code that implement Java's most advanced features(The awt, event handling and oop) and they give very little tangible explanation. If you are not completely able to follow every example from the start, they will lose you by the middle of the book as their programs grow to hundreds of lines of code...is this book for students ? I hardly think so, and what about the price ? 50 bucks! I smell some ego here. Save it for something else or plan on buying another Java book to understand this one."
5,Wonderfully helpful,"I have found this book extremely valuable, even indispensable, as a companion to reading the Hebrew bible. Well, a live teacher would be better, of course, but, failing that, this book is a fine friend, parsing every word that looks funny to me. A measure of its effectiveness, I suppose, is that I need to use it less and less and less, as I learn the grammar and gain confidence that the lexicon will parse the word just as I've done!"
5,Daughter loves this!,Full Metal Alchemist is one of my daughters favorite shows next to Dr. Who. Thus is one plush that goes wherever she goes.
3,Just OK,"The BP-200 adds functionality to my Rebel 2000, but admittedly I'm a bit disappointed. It definately has a cheap feel to it. It does help with the balance on the camera and is egonomically better than the standard grip. I just wish it felt more substantial."
2,4 of 12 Pens Exploded On Me,"Watch out for these pens. Perhaps I had a defective batch - 25% of them ""broke"" in my pocket. I don't do anything rigorous with the pens in my pocket, i.e. jumping jacks, get tackled, go skydiving, so I'm not really sure why I've had such bad luck. I've never had a problem with exploding pens. Back in my day, I gawked at kids in school whose pens exploded on them, not even believing such a thing was possible. I do think these pens write nice and people I come into contact with always try to steal them from me but I wouldn't recommend them for anyone who would be transporting these pens long distances on their person in their pocket. I would recommend getting these pens for someone you don't like very much whose clothes you want to see ruined. If that's what your looking for, these will definitely do the trick."
2,Ink very faint,I bought these pens thinking that I was getting a bargain. But you get what you pay for. The Ink is very faint on paper. If you're going to buy BIC then go with the RoundStic pens.
3,Not a good pen,"I was highly disappointed with the interior construction of this Bic pen because when I took it apart, I was unable to build a bazooka out of it like I used to in my dad's office when I was a kid. Now what I am supposed to do at work, and how and I entertain myself and my cubicle neighbors? It's a good thing the company also has plenty of rubber bands and paperclips."
4,Not Enough Ink,"I bought these pens in the hope that they would be smooth and write in dark black ink but not so. They are okay but the smoothness of the tip isn't there when I write and the ink goes onto the paper as if I'm using a fine tip rather than a medium, which was a bit disappointing, ergo, the 4 stars."
2,Not the same,"This looks exactly like the pen I have used many times before. For some reason, all the pens in this box are not consistent with the same exact pens I have used before. The ink is dull, its grey-ish/blue. I have a crappy staples pen, and that pen writes darker then this.The 'black' ink is not black. It's not dark at all.Maybe I had a few defective pens? I tried all 12. They all do not perform well.Does the pen work? YesDoes it fit everybody's review? NoWould I buy it again here? No. But somewhere else - yes"
2,very light ink,These pens work wonderfully for the first 5 minutes of use. After that the ink becomes more of a dark gray than a black. I would not buy these again.
4,Nice Xmas Work From The Transfer,"I concur with the prior reviewer that the second rate selected Lennon/Mcartney closing track mars this from getting a five star review. I was fortunate to see Manhattan Transfer live several years ago & they sound as good as their studio recorded efforts in person. This group is in a musical class by themselves, & makes you wonder what some of the top vocal groups from the 1940's could have sounded with todays arrangement & recording advances. An xmas CD worth owning!!!"
2,"OK if you want schmaltzy...not if you want ""jazzy""","I had hoped for something along the lines of a Take 6ish sound with lots of scat singing...vocal improvisation, swing inspired vocalese. Y'know...more like their REGULAR stuff. This was not to be. Instead a lot of very string dominated Streisand,Nat King Cole type orchestration. Nice if that's what you want, but I thought this would be different."
5,FABULOUS!,I didn't know that Manhattan Transfer had a Christmas CD until I searching on EBAY.com. I was blown away to find out about this CD. And was I so glad to finally recieve my own copy. This music is absolutely FABULOUS! Their vocals are tight. Tony Bennet sounds great with them. And all of the Christmasy sounds such as the bells and the Boys Choir make this CD so stunning. The group's vocals along with the wonderful orchestra make this an inspiring and uplifting album. GREAT JOB MANHATTAN TRANSFER!!
5,Year Round Christmas Music,"I love Manhattan Transfer and waited less than patiently for them to do a Christmas Album. It was worth the wait!! I listen to this CD all the time my husband gave up trying to remind me that I should only listen to Christmas music at Christmas time. And he's hooked too. I could listen to ""Snowfall"" forever! I love this CD!!"
2,Not what I had in mind.,"Now when I first heard that the Manhattan Transfer came out with their Christmas album, I was hoping to hear some jazzy upbeat songs. When I heard most of the album, I was very disappointed. Many of the songs they sing are too slow or somber--especially ""Let It Snow"". They sing mostly traditional Christmas songs with little or no variety--which after five minutes of listening to, it put me to sleep. Very much set in stone. Shame on you, MT! I was really looking forward to some ""swingin'and singin'"" tunes. This holiday album did not meet my expectations."
3,A soon-to-be-classic,"This album contains some of the best Christmas music you can find, from the traditional ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" to the very hip version of ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"". It's the kind of album you can play at a dinner party, while you open presents Christmas morning, or while you relax in your chair. I get this out every year and play it at least a dozen times or more."
3,Christmas music for quiet evenings,"This turned out to be a surprisingly good Christmas album. The only disappointment is that it's rather subdued. ""Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow"" in particular is performed at a rather slow temple; anyone more used to the Vaughn Monroe version (movie fans will recognize it as the song playing over the closing credits of ""Die Hard"") may find it a bit agonizing to listen to at first, bemoaning the lack of a speed/pitch control on most CD players.On the other hand, the album does have a decidely romantic feel to it that should work perfectly for those quiet holiday evenings as the day draws near."
3,"Very Nice Holiday Music, But Not Usual Manhattan Transfer","Here it is in a nutshell: This is a beautifully performed and arranged, but very slow and relaxed Christmas album. It is great background music, and perfect when you want to sit and relax and be swept away after battling the holiday rush. I wouldn't recommend it for getting your Christmas party hopping. Although I like this album, I was a little disappointed with it, because I know what the Manhattan Transfer is capable of, and I feel that on this album they did not push the musical envelope like they usually do. I supect the record company that released the album is mostly at fault for that, trying for a safe, marketable record. The Manhattan Transfer seems relieved on subsequent albums to be back with Atlantic Records. As another reviewer recommended, listen to the samples before buying to make sure this is what you want. As always with Manhattan Transfer records, check the liner notes for some surprise guest appearances."
2,Not what I had in mind.,"Now when I first heard that the Manhattan Transfer came out with their Christmas album, I was hoping to hear some jazzy upbeat songs.

1,There just aren't enough o's in snooooooooozer.....,"I love the Manhattan Transfer, but this should really be called Manhattan Transfer's Slow and Drippy Christmas Album. There is really nothing uplifting or spirit-filled about this collection. Their tight, harmonic talents are wasted when each song is so slow and one dimensional."
5,beautiful Christmas Music,This is Christmas music like only the Manhattan Transfer can sing it! It's a wonderful and unique addition to any holiday music collection.
1,Super Audio CD,"This is a ""Super Audio"" CD and has been dicontinued by Sony / ColombiaThis item - WON'T PLAY ON STD. CD PLAYER"
1,ABDICATE THIS!!!,"This may not be the absolute worse movie ever made in the history of film making, but it is damn close to it. CAVEAT EMPTOR !"
2,Edward & Mrs. Simpson,"The acting and casting looked good to me but the theme song that played at the beginning and end of each DVD drove me absolutely nuts. I also didn't care for the artifical quality of some of the indoor scenes. In particular, the lighting reminded me too much of what I call ""soap opera lighting."" I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a play, a movie, or a docu-drama but whatever it was it didn't feel real to me. It felt fake."
3,Mrs. Simpson,I gave this an average rating. Actors and sets werevery good. My problem was the wordy and over long discussionsbetween the prince and his ministers. Prince Edward was aplayboy. That was well known. Wallis Simpson was a 40ish Cinderellawho wanted to climb socially. She and the prince played inthe high society playground. And they did it with gusto!I think more script time on the couple and a lot lessof hand wringing decisions would have been more interesting.
2,disappointing - shallow and stilted performances,"I was very disappointed with this version of the story of Edward and Mrs. Simpson. The settings were play like rather than film like - overlit and un-natural. The actors played the parts like a Grade B sit com - with little feeling or emotion. Did not stand up to other productions like ""Victoria and Albert"" which I have watched again and again. Maybe it's just me - but I couldn't even finish watching this - don't waste your money - in my opinion."
3,A good miniseries,"This is a well done miniseries, but it is too long for any but the most diehard romantics. I liked it."
2,Very Dated,"I bought this DVD because I love period dramas. I love being lost in glamorous costumes and authentic settings. However, this version from 1978 has many a scene with cardboard walls, although there are some outdoor shots. I grew up with the dated 'Upstairs, Downstairs' and the sets for the internal shots for this melodrama are no better. The acting is 5-star but the indoor sets are mediocre at best."
3,Roller ball pen not as smooth as I expected,"I thought these were ""fine"" rather than ""micro"". The problem with the smaller sizes is that the ""roller ball"" doesn't roll as easily or smoothly as you would expect. I reordered some that were medium so I could get the smoothness and ease of writing."
5,God Thinks You're Wonderful,I had seen this book at a gift shop and knew I loved it. It was so convenient to order online from Amazon.
2,book quality,"The books were a little sticky & dirty. I haven't had any luck getting the sticky off. The condition was not what I expected for being labeled ""new""."
5,Sweet Little Story,"This is a very sweet little picture book (not a board book though so look out when giving to babies) that I give as part of a gift to every baby I give a gift too. Love it so much, and so do my own children. My mom gave it to me as an 18th birthday present."
5,very happy,"I bought this book used, but it looked brand new. Very happy with this purchase.. Price was great, received it very quickly.. I would buy again from this seller.. very very happy."
2,Therma rest mat,"I researched this item before I purchased it thinking it was a good price and it had fairly good reviews. My conclusion is that for backpacking it probably is a good choice as it is lightweight. For tent camping such as we did,forget it ! It felt like I was sleeping directly on the ground. There is no cushion whatsoever to this mat."
2,save your money,"The product wasn't really useful. My daughter used in while camping and you couldn't even tell it was there. I know it's called ""short"" but it's very short - so pay attention to the dimensions. I would have rather not purchased this at all or gone with a simple egg crate type mat."
4,Happy with the purchase,"Bought two regular sized ones for my wife and me for our camping trips. The length of the small size is too small for anyone except kids.It packs light, although bulky. But you will never feel any added weight, just tie it to the outside of your backpack and you can forget about it. It insulates well and provides reasonable comfort. Best thing is I don't have to worry about where I put this down unlike the inflated ones in which, you have to be extra careful not to punch any holes in it. So considering the price and the ruggedness and zero maintenance and care, I am very happy with the purchase."
2,Not what we were expecging,"We bought these for camping. They were so thin, it felt just like sleeping on the ground. They did insulate a little so it was warmer thant he ground...but we returned these right away because they weren't worth it!"
5,Read it,It's the top book on my need to read pile. I'm looking forward to it. If only I read faster.
5,Great little unit,"I have bought about 8 of these little units for Audio Video installs to backup power for networed audio computers. They haven't failed me yet, and are a nice compact simple package."
5,Great stuff!,"I thought TRASHED was hilarious! I was laughing so much my girlfriend kept looking over my shoulder to see what the big deal was. This is some gross stuff, but in a good way! Some of the things that happen to the two main characters are so over the top nasty that you know it must be true. I highly recommend this book - money well spent."
5,I was on the truck with derf,"I spent the summer on the back of a Richfield, Ohio garbage truck with derf some 20 years ago. It is all true. The characters are all real and most of them still there. As for me, I'm a college professor in small Midwestern town. I truly can't wait for derf to capture some of the other escapades, such as toilet papering houses, laughing at Jeff Dahmer, or moving pianos, in his artform comics. Mike Kukral"
1,IT'S A BORE!,"I would have given Anonymous no stars, but then my comments wouldn't be posted. The acting was second rate. Redgrave The Elder gave another one of her eccentric performances.Mark Rylance has been called one of the great Shakespearean actors, but from his ham-handed performance in Anonymous he could have fooled me. The men faded into the woodwork.I knew the movie made a hash of English history and theatre and drama, so I wasn't surprised by anything. I got the feeling John Orloff had a list of Oxfordian points he had to include in the movie and once he did, he checked then off. The major problem I had with Anonymous is it's a bore! There is no sense of urgency. The story plods along. The endless jumping back and forth in time made the story confusing to follow.After seeing Anonymous, I understand why it tanked!"
5,Anonymous,"A great film if you are interested in the theatre, Shakespeare, or just a good mystery. Fascinating hypothesis on who really wrote the plays and poems attributed to William Shakespeare. After seeing the film, I was curious enough to do some personal research on this intersting subject. Worth your time!"
3,"Great concept, but too ambitious for me","This seemed like a great concept, but it lost something in translation. It seemed to loose a degree of direction in the overly ambitious concept. The acting was great, the dialogue was great, but the execution was a little bit confused. Consequently, I just became a little bit bored at points and almost gave up on the movie. But I did not, but only because the director attempted to do something very unusual and interesting. All in all, it took some effort to work my way through this historical thriller. Get it and give it a shot if you dare."
2,Ghastly,"Sounded intriguing, and great intro with Jacobi, but (after allowing for the fiction necessary to present their speculative lark) after you realize the only ""historically accurate"" thing in this movie is perhaps the CGI scenery, the whole thing lapses into a slow, tedious reinvention of the time based on our own projections and paranoias. The characters are caricatures and cliches and sometimes grossly slandered, albeit well acted. Wanted to see where this was all going but with no sympathetic characters to make me care, I gave up halfway.I hope no one thought they ""learned"" anything about history from this movie, not even about the period."
2,Underwhleming.,I don't believe Shakespere -- whomever he was- was as much of a pompous bore as he is made out to be in this film.
5,Who wrote What Now?,"This is for the die hard fan or the guy that flunked out of English Lit!! Great original story great visuals this is Sakespears England and ITs loaded with laughs, tears, drama plot twists action. Anonymous is probably one of the best acted movies of the last decade With hero's and Villan's you wont want to forget! I believe this film should have won best picture for the year it was released no if's and's or but's. This movie was a lot of fun and I would recommend it to any one!!"
4,Oxfordian theory presented well,"I really liked this movie and all it's intrigue. It purports the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare, not the usual Stratsfordian theory, based on a book written in 1910. A historian told me this is a minority opinion and Wikipedia gives credit to both theories. But whatever is true, the movie makes Queen Elizabeth, the characters, and the Oxforidan theory seem plausable and alive. I thought the movie was well-done and worth a rental."
5,Superbly written and beautifully played,"My number one criticism would be perhaps the title and definitely the cover art. It looks like you are about to watch Hellraiser. Anyway this movie has all the themes of love, sex, politics and war, betrayal that you would expect from a Shakespearean piece. And they deliver with much of the Bard's verses being performed within the story. It's hard to know how much of this movies was based on fact and what is pure fiction. But after seeing this it is hard to rule out the possibility which the movie implies."
3,Interesting Perspective,"the movie is a little slow however a good story line, and probably some truth weaved into the perspective of possibilities, especially regarding the queen..., and shake-sphere too.-amazon seller video superstore was amazingly quick getting the movie out to me:)"
2,"Ok, nothing to write home about",Thought it would be revolutionary like SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. It wasn't. Not a bad premise but a bit slow for my taste.
4,Entertaining,"Entertaining. Set in the political snake-pit of Elizabethan England, ANONYMOUS speculates on an issue that has for centuries intrigued academics and brilliant minds... who was the author of the plays credited to William Shakespeare?"
2,It was ok...,"I thought this movie looked interesting, but i honestly felt like the movie was lacking. After about an hour I was thinking, is this over almost...but it still had an hour left. It got better towards the end but it wasn't what I had hoped for."
1,Doesn't discuss MY superior theory,"Do you know who wrote Shakespeare's plays?I do.ALIENS.Think about it. Man alone could not have written those plays. Why, they anticipated words like ""downstairs"" - written before such words came into widespread use! Clearly, the true author of the Shakespeare plays must have been an alien.And what about the weird dialect? Did an Englishman really get basic words, like ""if,"" wrong time after time? Obviously, the real author had a lot of trouble with English. The twisted, annoying and convoluted language clearly bespeaks alien influences.If this movie had given so much as a nod to the aliens theory, it would be 5 stars. But it did not."
1,"Hollywood, please stop making historical movies","Many theories have been discussed regarding the identity and authenticity of William Shakespeare. Personally, as a historian and Shakespeare enthusiast, I believe that William Shakespeare himself penned these remarkable plays, but I'm always intrigued whenever other theories arise. However, the movie itself is a disaster. In portraying the Earl of Oxford as the intelligent playwright, Anonymous, Director Roland Emmerich rewrites history... (Spoiler Alert) Not only is William Shakespeare a drunken illiterate fool (much like Bottom in a Midsummer Night's Dream) but Queen Elizabeth, historically the celebrated Virgin Queen, is an emotional whore who can't function without her advisors, commits incest, and has not 1 but 3 bastard children. Once again, Hollywood please stop making historical movies."
1,"Good movie, Horrible quality","This was an interesting movie, ruined by Amazons instant viewing quality. For a whole 3 dollars I could have gone out and rented this from freaking blockbuster."
2,Disappointing,"I did not like this film. This is of course a matter of personal opinion. The cast was wonderful, the settings were lush and the costumes were fabulous. I am not a fan of presenting speculation as fact. I do love sci fi and fantasy and alternative history but not in this format. What ever happened to presenting history as fact?"
1,More Flat-Earthers Denying Fact.,"This film should never have seen the light of day. It is the ""Prince Tudor"" theory which suggests that Elizabeth the 1st, widely considered the finest monarch in England's storied history, was nothing more than an empty-headed trollop who could not keep track of where she'd farmed out her bastards. Most major critics recognized it for the tripe it was and reviewed it accordingly. Who am I to disagree with The Rolling Stone?Try to avoid this if at all possible. Look away!For your own sake, look away!"
4,"Very cool, enjoyable movie","I wasn't sure what to expect, but I thought it was a great flick. You have to pay attention, but still very entertaining."
4,Movie good; Streaming average,"The movie was thought provoking and well done. We had some pixelation during it, so it was not a perfect viewing experience. Aside from that, we enjoyed the mix of history and fiction. My husband and I were so intrigued that we delved into the actual historical story! If you like Shakespeare, or are intrigued by the controversy, watch this movie. You won't regret it."
4,"Not my fave, but a great cd nonetheless","The title says it all. This cd is great simply because you can never go wrong with cruxshadows. But, out of my collection of every cruxshadows I can get my hands on, this one is listened to the least. I prefer this one for the more upbeat tracks and less for the quiet solemn sounds I usually prefer from cruxshadows. A good cd to have for the moments in between or to just add to your collection, but if listening to cruxshadows for the first time, I would suggest starting with telemetry of a fallen angel."
2,no new ground is broken,There are a few enjoyable moments on this CD but the the sonic experience provided by the majority of the album can be roughly simulated by playing Depeche Mode and Bauhaus at the same time.The songwriting on the album is at best imitative and at worst it sounds like it was spewed directly from some Projekt-band random goth lyric generator.I give it two stars for basic solidity of musical structure but there is nothing new here. Spend your money elsewhere.
4,Unlocking the Mystery of the Whisper,"The Crüxshadows, originating from Florida, most likely had a great challenge creating a follow-up as bright and as original as their official debut album, ""Telemetry of a Fallen Angel,"" but ""Mystery of the Whisper"" stands very well on its own. The album is consistently wonderful all the way through, and requires a lot of repeated listenings to fully appreciate the complex array of sounds, imagery and thoughts. You hear something new each time. Stand-out tracks include the edgy ""Cruelty,"" the emotional depth of ""Breathe,"" and the bitter-sweet melancholy of ""Sympathy (for Tomorrow.) I highly recommend this album and look forward to seeing how one of my favorite bands continues to develop."
1,quick strut,"Notice that this picture of the product is for a front strut assy. When I received my order, I got the rear assy. A little research and lo and behold the part no. 171831 is for a rear strut. The quality of the parts looks excellent."
3,Not Good for Understanding Thai Language,"I would not recommend this cassette pack to someone who's trying to learn Thai. The phrasebook is a good reference, but the tape could use a supplementary book that introduces the language itself. The Thai script is printed rather small and no effort is made to teach it to the reader/user. The cassette is useful only for perfecting pronounciation and intonation, not for learning the language. The beginner should look for a book that is interactive with the cassettes."
3,Good purchase overall,I bought the pack to learn Thai in my car. Male and female speaker are professionals with clear pronunciation. On the whole the pack is suited better for learning a lot of new phrases and sentences than learning to combine words and grammar into new sentences.
1,"Nice, until you actually use it and it starts to rust....","We bought this caddy for our second bathroom. It looks great, and can carry a lot. However, as soon as the bathroom starting getting regularly used, the caddy started to rust, and has now been thrown out. Pretty amazing, since that bathroom did not get much use. I'd avoid this one. It must lack the protective coating of other chrome caddys."
1,I feel tricked,"THIS IS NOT THE FIFTH EDITION.I needed to purchase the 5th edition of this textbook for my class, which has the cover that is shown in the thumbnail. Instead I got the third edition, which is from 1990. A lot of the content has been moved around and the examples are outdated; one of them discusses the process of deciding whether or not automobile companies should make safety features like seatbelts available in all vehicles.If you are looking for the fifth edition, look elsewhere!"
1,Boring!,This book bores the hell out of me!! I do not recommend this book. Don't waste your time reading this book!
5,Great show,"Leverage is one of those shows that get your attention from the get go. Sometimes I will be watching and episode and question if what is happening is part of the con or what...lol. Third season has new characters, new cons....love it."
5,Leverage - Second season,I love this show - period! Each season they have a new set of unique plots and I really enjoy watching the cons unfold. LOVE Christian Kane!!!
5,Favorite TV Show!!!,This TV Show is awesome and I absolutely love having it on DVD now because I get the behind the scenes and the gag reels. So happy with this product!!!
4,"Leverage, an American TV Show","My wife and I enjoy the characters in the TV series ""Leverage"". The stories are somewhat predictable, but the characters are not. The show has a good mix of humor, drama, and suspense."
5,Any Leverage is a good Leverage,"I have never been disappointed in an episode of Leverage and this is no exception. I missed this one during the regular season and so bought just the one episode to enjoy. I have every full season that has been released and will also be buying Season 5. Great writing, exceptional acting, interesting characters and a lot of fun even when it's a serious subject. Exciting too. Don't miss out on an opportunity for real entertainment that can be enjoyed over and over again."
1,Love the Show - HATE no subtitles,"Purchased the 3rd season - absolutely LOVE the show (me and my wife). I'm hard of hearing, as I saw another commenter is as well. Contacted Paramount Home Video, who gave us a lame explanation. Though there are no subtitles, you CAN see words if you turn on captions through your television set. We've tried all 4 caption settings on our television, and nothing worked So, if you don't have a BluRay DVD player, or a DVD player that has upsampling, the captions through your television SHOULD work (no guarantees). I haven't yet heard back on whether or not they're going to add subtitles to future DVD releases (gave them a what-for as subtitles are EASILY added, and so on, and so forth.) Hopefully they'll listen to reason."
4,Leverage has it!,"Great show cleaver, cute,and the girls are beautiful and engaging.Acting is good and this show has some great humorand cleaver plots"
5,Best show on television...arguably.,"If you like smart, ensemble shows this is a good show to watch. Good acting, good stories, and a real sense of both fun and drama. The only thing I'd like to see more of is some video interviews with the whole cast. The extras they provide are nice, but more of the cast would be nice."
5,awesome series,I bought this item for my son who is serving in the military. He got it quickly and in good condition. He and his wife really like this series.
1,Defective Amazon discs,The first two discs were defective. I ended up throwing it out! And it was supposed to be new. Next time I will go to a store to purchase. I am really unhappy. This was my last Amazon purchase.
5,Great!!,"Wow... sometimes you listen to a soundtrack and half of the songs aren't even in the movie itself. This is not the case with this CD. Every song is from the movie, which, in essence, is what a soundtrack should be. The only bad part is that the CD doesn't have Madonna's song, ""This Used to Be My Playground."""
3,Nice... just nice.,"The album contains some excellent period pieces, although the opening Carole King number is nothing but a throwaway. Hans Zimmer's score can be sometimes brilliant, sometimes boring. Yet the real fun is ""The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Song"", sung by The Rockford Peaches (Geena Davis, Madonna, and other cast members). This could have been a classic soundtrack if the incredible ballad ""This Used To Be Playground"" weren't missing (Due to Madonna's contract, it had to appear on her own label, and finally surfaced on the superb ""Something To Remember"" album)."
3,Mostly good-missing Madonna,"It was good except I was sorry to see that it didn't have any of Madonnas songs that were in the movie, but not on the cd.."
5,Excellent Music - A Lot of Fun!,"I enjoyed this movie so much more thanks to the music! Any movie can only do well from good music - but the music for this particularly movie was so well-choosen, and so appropo to it. The music created for it is just as delightful. I very highly recommend this soundtrack!"
3,Cassette,"I will never know if I liked this or not as I ordered a cassette, by mistake, and was not able to return it. Since I do not have a cassette player I am not able to tell if I liked it or not. I love the movie so would guess I would have liked it...So make sure you check before ordering what you are getting is what you want before clicking the ""Order"" button."
5,A healthy collection of Blues classics...,"This is indeed very balanced and contains many essential blues artists and anthems including the classic ""Summertime"" by good old Billie Holiday. These are most of the Blues tunes you have to know.Good selection... Good price... Good starting point in Blues."
5,Holy & Pink!!,"I LOVE my new bible, it is my favorite color and very handy to carry around. Im just now starting to go back to church and I bought this as an incentive to do such. I couldnt have picked a better bible and at such an amazing price. Thank you!!!!"
1,woe,"I never got my book..I've paid for it and never got it ,I want my money back ...sad..some I can't even read what I paid for"
3,"Good as reference, but hard to learn from","The reason why I only give this book 3 stars is that the book can only be used as a reference to OpenGL extensions. There is no demos or even source-code provided with the book, which makes the book extremely hard to learn from because you won't find any working code, just each extension described. Being an experienced OpenGL programmer this is not a huge problem for me, but since I believe many beginner OpenGL programmers find this books topic interesting, I thought I would warn you. Eric Lengyel is a great writer and his Mathematics for Game Programmers is a must-have. So before buying this book, please make sure that you are skilled enough to learn from a reference-book with no demos!"
4,Good reference,"This was a good reference book, but unfortunatelly it got outdated very fast... I wish it had more indepth explanations in some cases but it does the job."
4,Rock p svenska,"This is the final album from November, a Swedish hard rock band from the early 1970s. They were a power trio who didn't radically differ from British hard rock contemporaries like Cream, Led Zeppelin, or the Who except in one regard - they sang in their native language! While the band may not have been trailblazers musically, all three were great musicians (especially guitarist Rickard Rolf, who was as good, if not better, than his British and American contemporaries) and they were fine songwriters. Besides 6:e November (November 6th, named for the day Swedish king Gustav II Adolf was killed in battle in 1632), this version of the album contains numerous bonus tracks. Highlights include the Santana-influenced opener, ""Starka Tillsammans"", the sombre ""Februari"", and the epic ""Kommer L?ngsamt""."
5,A good 70's hits CD,"I bought this for ""My Sharona"" and ""Loco-Motion"" but I like a lot of the other songs, too. If you like mid-70's rock, you'll probably like it, too."
1,Not good,"I love when men write so well from a woman's pov that I forget entirely who the author is while I am engrossd in the character's story. Wally Lamb is an excellent example of someone who is able to make readers forget, even disbelieve, that a man is writing. Lary Crews is not. Veronica is a stereotypical cartoon woman. Not only couldn't I relate to her, I wouldn't want to relate to her. The rest of the characters are flat, and I found the errors in logic so distracting that I couldn't finish it. Sorry."
5,Pens that write...well,These are some of my favorite pens. Hard to find them anywhere else in brick and mortar stores. I take lots of notes at work and they are my preferred pen. Definitely recommend them.
5,Great pen,These pens write very smoothly and cleanly and the price for a dozen is better than the office supply stores.
1,these guys ripped me off!,"I purchased a box of 12 Uniball pens, I even showed the listing to friends to make sure that the add was for 12 pens and not one. But they shipped me one pen, and charged me 6.99 shipping to boot! I refused the shipment, as per my postal carrier's instructions, and tried to contact the company, but they never even tried to get back to me. So, lesson learned."
1,Awful,YOU SENT THE WRONG PENS.I WANTED UNIBALL VISION ELITE. THAT'S A GREAT PEN. YOU DID THIS TO MY DAUGHTER IN NJ. TOO. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU GUYS?
4,Dehumanized doesn't suck.,"Dehumanized is a great death metal band. Nothing new or special, but they are tight and develope good grooves. Worth buying for any death metal fan and a good introduction to death metal for those not yet familiar with it."
2,If only....,"My new Oregon Scientific BHT663A Wireless Home Weather Stationsseemed like a great gadget, but it constantly predicted rain. I live in Northern California. It hasn't rained here in months nor is it likely to anytime soon. Alas, if only the forcast were correct! I called Oregon Scientific (great customer service!) and was advised that the unit was most likely defective (I'll say!) so I returned it to the supplier, ordered another, and the new one works fine."
5,Wrong Turn is epic,The original Wrong Turn is worth the price alone son it is as if your are getting Wrong Turn 2 free. That being said Wrong Turn 2 is not very good.
1,Item shipped is NOT what is advertised,"I ordered this ChapStick Cherry 24 pack -- as it is pictured above. However, what I received was a 24 pack of the ChapStick Cherry CLASSIC, which I am allergic to. I have contacted the seller in hopes of returning this item and also wishing they would replace the falsely advertised product picture they are using. Nowhere does it show (not in the picture nor in the item description) that this 24 pack is for the CLASSIC chapstick. The shipping label said I only had 7 days from the date of the invoice to return it, and it has already been 6 days (I just received it yesterday!), so I really hope they do the right thing and allow me to return this item.EDIT: The company agreed for me to return the item but the shipping label they emailed me has the customer as the responsible party to pay for postage. I feel it is incredibly unfair to have the customer PAY to return an incorrect item sent by MISTAKE of the company. Not ok."
3,Honest opinion,"In Instant Vocabulary, Ida Ehrlich presents a systematic method for developing a stonger vocabulary through the utilization of word-roots. While I found the structure of this book sound and accessible, the content and words that were covered within each section were either rather common or irrelevant. I would not recommend this book to someone who is attempting to strengthen their vocabulary for the GRE simply because most of the words on the GRE do not derive from the conventional roots presented in this book. However, it is affordable enough for anyone who feels they may benefit from such an approach to try it for themselves."
5,"yes, absolutely the perfect pen","I have to agree with everyone else. This is the perfect pen, and I try to use no other."
4,my favorite,"Looks like I reviewed the .5mm version elsewhere, giving it the praise that this pen should have got. Used to be able to get these in bulk from Costco. They're skinnier than the .5mm version (which I prefer), and they write more thinly (which is the very best part). Taking off a star because sometimes I'd get a clinker, one that never quite worked right, or one that didn't seem to last very long. But these are the best pens I've used. Hate thick pens, and those that write too thick. And I'm down to my last one, so need a new supply!"
5,BEST-PEN-EVER!,"I love, love, LOVE this pen. I have tried many pens over the years, and this by far has no competition. It writes so smoothly and lightly that it feels as if the pen is using you, not the other way around. Best pen to take notes (for college students). I even use it to draw when I run out of ink in my drawing pens. I highly recommend this pen to anyone :)"
1,"Love the pens, but hate the vendor","Package was damaged and only contained 11 not the entire dozen pens. Wish there was an easy way for me to tell the vendor what happened, but could only leave packaging feedback. Tech Armor, another vendor, was fabulous and actually provided me with an entire new set of protective covers for my phone when I left feedback that I could not lift off a sticker.Have no idea who fulfilled the pen order, but I hope they will send me the 12th pen, and preferably in packaging that is intact and doesn't look like it was trampled upon."
1,Changed the ink...no longer good,"I have used these pens for the last 5 years and been very happy with them. However, they have changed the ink used in the pens. They call it ""super-ink"" and claim that it helps stop check fraud. That sounds great, but the ink itself no longer has that deep bold blue color I've come to love. I'm very disappointed with this change as I will now have to find a new brand."
1,Returning Buyers Beware - Ink Color has Changed,"This pen has been a long time favorite. No longer. The new ""super ink"" color (much lighter blue) does not translate well if you need to fax the document on which it is used. I am now in search of a new pen in the same price range."
1,Noooo!!!!!!,"The new ""fraud prevention ink"" is horrible. It does not flow as well, it is a lighter shade of blue, and the pens seems to ""die"" almost immediately. Please, for the love of god, go back to the old blue - your stupid ink isn't going to prevent one act of fraud."
1,Terrible ink color,"This had become my favorite cheap pen, looks professional for a throwaway, writes great and was decent color blue. Unfortunately as others have stated they ruined the pen with light, wimpy blue. Too bad since it was a five but the terrible color now makes it a 1 star at best."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I bought a far better version of this at a higher price. This one, while very cheap, is just that - cheap. It feels cheap, the buttons are hard to press, and you get the sense it will break at any time. so if you want a cheaply-made wind-up flashlight that feels cheap at a cheap price...this one's for you."
5,Great Classic Shoe,"I ran marathons in the 1980s in these shoes. After heart problems I went looking for shoes for cardiac rehab,and was surprised to find these still available! They fit as well as they did 30 years ago.Great shoe, great fit."
1,Quality of shoe,I have used Saucony shoes for years. In fact one of my favorite running shoes 25 years ago was the Saucony Jazz.As to the recent purchase. I was pleased that Amazon made possible the purchase of Saucony shoes. BUT after using them for a short time I realized they were defective. I noticed that the ball of my foot was dropping into a depression which caused my foot to become very sore. When inspecting the shoe closely the slope and placement of the raised treads on the bottom of the shoe and the relative thinness of the inner removable sole were allowing the ball of my foot to drop into a hole which was rubbing and creating soreness. I have partially corrected this by placing a thick piece of doe skin on the bottom of the inner sole. The situation is still not right.thanks for listening Karl Mosher
4,Eye catching and comfortable,"Solid shoes that perform reasonably well for running. I've done a 7mile run and a few 4.5 mile runs in these shoes without much of a problem. They're not the best running shoes for fast runners but they should work fine for a relaxed pace. The insoles are crap in every pair of shoes so I recommend an aftermarket insole such as superfeet green if you want to put some miles on them. They are definitely true to size. Since the white parts of the shoes are very crisp, they stand out a lot giving you a serious retro athletic look."
5,spectaculoso,"As the greatest luchador the world has ever seen, I need good shoes. These shoes are muy bueno. Me gustan los zapatos."
4,better days alright,"This was not Joe's best album. In my opinion, he really has seen better days. I hate the fact that I can't listen to this album from the front to the back."
1,love joe but not feeling this one,"I really I did not feel this cd at all. nothing like what i expect of a joe cd, nothing like his first 3. what if a woman is the only song i truely like and one song isnt enough to keep it in the stereo.I tried a few times thinking maybe it would grow on me but it didnt. I didnt care much for this cd, but i highly recommend the other 4 joe cd's for any r&b fan. I think ""all that I am"" was his best and ""my name is joe"" and ""and then"" are also very good. I recommend those over this one."
4,Good Album,"Joe seems to be moving ina more or less neo-soul direction than just straight up R & B ... good move. This album has some great moments including ""Let's Stay Home Tonight"", the R. Kelly-esque""Ghetto Child"" and ""I Understand"". Smooth track help this album flow like honey. The harder songs (although I would not call them hard!) like ""I Like Sexy Girls"" are great without losing the cohesiveness of the album. This album reminded me a little of R Kelly's TP-2.COM although a lot better (you will see how I felt about Kelly's album in my review for it. Not that I don't like R, but he missed the mark!). Good follow up to ""My Name Is Joe"" and much more of a general theme can be seen."
1,Weak&too Predcitable,Joe is one of those Artists that is so Comfortable being a Good 2nd-tier Act.He is a Hybrid of many acts out now&that ain't saying much.He has Talent but He Settles for Predictable Material that doesn't showcase Him fully.this Album comes too soon as well like Easy Cash In as to Artistic Leap.
5,KEEP DOIN' YOUR THING!,Joe has won my heart again. This is an artist that has been slept on and not appreciated enough for all the beautiful work he does. My name is Joe CD is my all time favorite and NEVER comes out of my CD player. Keep it up Joe!
5,Definitely Some Good Dayz!,"Joe does an excellent job on Better Days with his soulful voice and smooth ballads. Hands down, Joe is an exceptional talent that should be recognized. He's by far one of the best male singers out there right next to Luther Vandross. Joe's intoxicating love ballads leave you feeling loved, respected, and most all cherished as a woman. As a man his songs shows you how to love, respect, and appreciate your woman. This is truly a man who indeed knows how to appreciate a woman.Joe demonstrates his tenderness on such songs as ""What If A Woman"" ""Ghetto Child"" ""She Used 2 Luv Me"" and the most beautiful song ever ""Lover's Prayer"". If you're looking for Better Days ahead, buy this album. I promise, you won't regret it."
5,JOE WATCH YOUR GIRL,THIS ALBUM IS CLASSIC NY SON LIKE GHETTO CHILD.MY WIFE'S FAVORITE SONG IS WHAT IF A WOMAN.GREAT BUY FOR R&B LOVERS!
3,A very good Album,I was very satisfied with album. It is not as strong as the other Joe albums but it can hold its own with them. I truly enjoyed the mix between the song Better Days and What If a woman. Very expertly blended they go hand and hand. Ghetto child is excellent. Joe has such a smooth style that no matter what he touches turns to gold. I recommend this album.
4,Why do I own this CD?,"Because my 8 year old son is OBSESSED with the Numa Numa song. And, God bless him, he tries to sing along with the entire song - in Romanian. And although it gets tiring listening to this CD over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over, it sure is funny to listen to him attempt to join in. Makes it all worth it."
4,stepping to the music,"I love this music to dance to and i can sing to it, oh my god i can sing to it and not worry i would be beeped out."
3,Missing 12th track,I purchased this CD for the english translation (Ma Ya Hi) and somehow it isn't even on this CD so whoever wrote the review messed up.The CD i have has only 11 tracks.
3,A classic song with a few other decent tracks.,"Most anyone who's been on Youtube has seen the chubby German kid throwing his hands in the air while pretending to sing the ""Numa Numa"" song. This CD not only has ""Dragonstei Din Tei"" (Numa Numa) but also an English language version with a heavier dance beat. There are also a few other clones of the classic but none would be worth buying on their own merits."
2,DiscOzone,"Although the CD is a nice composition of upbeat songs, I was expecting the ""Ma Ya Hi"" to just be the normal English version of ""Dragostea Din Tei"", except it's a very strange remix that just doesn't seem right. Very disappointed - only because I bought the CD for those 2 songs, and didn't get what I thought I was paying for. :("
4,Numa Numa song!,"Let me start by saying I rated this CD a 4 star because it has one song thats lame and another thats OK, but kinda slow. So I ordered this CD for my Wife after hearing this song redone by Brookers ""Crazed Numa fan"" on Youtube.com she is hilarious you must go and check it out!!! Any ways my Wife and three kids have gotten ahold of this CD and have played it so much that I honestly think their going to wear out the Stereo! The music is definetly not Disco its more Euro-pop or Techno. The beat is up tempo and very catchy! We have a friend who hates Techno and or music like this and he found himself singing it (Numa Numi Ye) as he was leaving my house! He called me an hour later angry that he couldn't stop singing it! That was hilarious! So if you dont like to sing along or dance or play it loud I wouldn't order this CD. On the other hand if you like music and have a little rhythm you'll love this CD and you'll probably wear it out!!!!!"
3,Only 1 good song on this CD,Very happy music. Only bad part is that its a little 2 corny. I like Euro music but this is just to much!!!!
1,pure shite,"Never have i had a more disapointing experience in my life than the 56 minutes I wasted listening to this pile of S hit. I loved Aqua's Aquarium and Eifel 65's ""Europop"" but this wretched spawn of hellfire does not stand close. Jonas Berggren, together with his two friends Johnny Lindén and Nicklas Tränk, made far superior jamtunes with their melodic tones and perfect, nay, godlike composing. I wouldn't listen to them with your ears. I really thought from everything i heard before November 2, 2004 that this was going to be the next La Bouche, but I was sorely mistaken. This is worse than Sid & Marty Krofft's ""Land Of The Lost"". Do not buy this. IT IS A RIPOFF!"
4,Grace With Aging...,"If you are in or approaching your ""third act,"" and you want to make the most of it, you NEED this book! Ms. Fogarty has opened her heart and she can help you open yours."
5,The way gothic music should sound,"For anyone who is an ""old schooler"" then i don't have to tell you how this album sounds.If you are and like old school goth then buy it.For any newbies who are just getting into the scene then i highly reccomend this album.Forget all of that crap you are hearing in the clubs these days,vnv,apop,razed in black etc..etc.This is what gothic music is all about and how it should be."
2,It's O.K but I've heard better,"Paralysed Age is O.K but I've heard better.""Bloodsucker 2000"" is my favorite track on this CD but it all sounds rather bland and seems to cater to the misfit ""goth"" teen scene. Save your money or better yet get The Vampire Lucan Wolf's CD ""Vampire Nights"" it's alot more fun and better produced."
2,Save your $ and buy a Sisters of Mercy CD instead,"This music was okay. It was listen-able. I didn't hate it. But I didn't love it, either. It would be fine background at any goth gathering, but that's about it. The recording quality left a bit to be desired. CD and Digital recordings have kind of spoiled me a bit, I am not used to hearing fuzz or hiss in the background of my music these days. The lyrics, when they could be understood, were rather interesting, but the music is pure Sisters of Mercy knockoff. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, SOM should be very flattered, indeed. Save your bux and buy Floodland or a collection of SOM's greatest hits."
1,kinda crummy,"It's only 80 pages, not 180 as the description claims. No text, just maps with no explanations. Most of the maps are visually uninteresting, with flat colors instead of gradient shading."
5,BAYOU BEND,"This is a comprehensive, well researched book on a spectacular collection. Miss Ima had a great eye for fine furniture and art of the American Federal Period. This collection is second only to the great Winterthur Collection as a repository of American Federal furniture. The setting for this collection is breathtaking, the mansion is beautiful and the setting, in Houston's finest area has to be seen to be believed. Miss Ima's collection is huge and the house, though large, is not big enough to showcase all of it, so when one visits the house they may see different items then they would have seen months earlier. To visit Bayou Bend in the Spring is to experience heaven on earth. This is a great guide to a singular collection in a unparalled setting. I highly recommend this guide and make a point if you are in Houston it visit this amazing house and collection, I assure you, you won't be disappointed."
2,Polder 773-83 Shoe Rack,"The rack is good looking. It arrived with several cracks (the wood is very hard) but a little glue fixed same. The wheels would not stay on but it doen't move around in the closet. So I left the wheels off. The extenders don't extend without a great deal of force, which can crack the hard wood. As is, it holds nine pairs of shoes."
2,"A retelling of ""Bully"" with fictional names","We're talking about the exact same people and the exact same killing. All this author did was to change everyone's names and cast the story in a light kinder to Marty Puccio, from the point of view of a 27-year-old ""victim advocate"". I had just seen the film ""Bully"" a few days before I read this book, and in several instances, the dialogue in the book was lifted from the screenplay (which was written at least in part by Jim Schutze, who wrote ""Bully"").Jim Schutze's ""Bully"" told the story a lot more compellingly, imo.Quaile's writing is heartfelt but that's about it."
5,What a nasty dude!,"I enjoyed the movie adaptation of this play immensely. I enjoyed reading it almost as much...and I STILL gave the play 5 stars!Valmont is such an interesting character I don't know where to start. He is without morals, charming, intelligent and would give Machiavelli a run for his money. Even so, he ends up being as human as any of us."
5,Nail Biting Suspense Made Easy,If you use just five of these suspense ideas your story will be much better. What if you used all 200+? Wow. Difference between a film or story being boring or not. Really easy to use too. Just weave these ideas into the previous exercises and plot points to make your story interesting.
4,Mr. Sandman...do that again,"This CD is great if all you want is Mr. Sandman but, we get so much more. The harmony and precision that these ladies put into their act is remarkable, very much like the best Barbershop quartet of all time, the Buffalo Bills.This CD is worth the cost. Just beware, I am allowed to sing along if I am alone but others want it quiet so they can appreciate the music. Did I say I am a bad singer?Anyway, Take a chance on this one."
2,Disappointed,I would not recommend this to anyone. I was so disappointed in the album that I only played it once..and out it goes.
2,don't get it!,"i got this phone free with a t-mobile plan, and at first was happy--it was a cute flip phone, light & i had fun playing with the features, although it was too bad there was no camera...unfortunately the phone's also very fragile, and after a while i started noticing a lot of static during calls and very poor reception. i would call people and they wouldn't be able to hear me AT ALL. lots of dropped calls. i called t-mobile about it and the tech support guy said he'd had similar complaints about this model from other customers. it got so bad that i just took the SIM card out and put it in this old nokia phone my dad used to use--clunky & not pretty but the reception & clarity turned out to be MUCH better on this old nokia phone. now that i'm looking for a new phone & plan, i'm checking out reviews carefully this time. hope this review is helpful in preventing others from making the mistake of getting the motorola v-180"
2,Sucks !,"Wow. So my Samsung E715 fell in love with my shotput and got competely smashed. I went over to tombile and picked up the cheapest flip phone they had at the time. Yes and this is indeed the cheapest. I down right hate this phone. The only reason why i give it two stars is because it can make calls and the speakerphone feature.1. Feels very cheap. Can get scratched easily. Falls apart2. Short battery life. If not charged at night, will die the next morning.3. Turns off whenever it wants. I tried taking out the battery, nothing happened. I will be on the phone and it will randomly turn off.Dont get the phone. pitch in the money and get a better phone. You'll thank me."
4,moto almost got it,"Ive had my V180 for about a week and have nothing but good things to say about it, ive even gotten good comments from my co-workers on the phone, the only feature ive found not up to par is the address book, when you enter you info: name, phone numbers, ect... you can not enter there home phone number, cell phone number on the same person under the same entry, but over all I think this is a great phone."
2,"Unreliable Ring, Screen Broke after 8 Months","I purchased this phone from T-Mobile. Phone is very lightweight and made of cheap plastic. After 6 months of ownership, the phone would not always ring. After 8 months, the phone's color display went dark. At this point, I could only receive calls - could not make any outgoing calls or use the phone beyond answering incoming calls. Called T-Mobile and they wanted $10 from me return it for a new one, even though it was under full warranty. What's more outrageous is they were only going to insure the new V180 for 90 days; they have a lot of faith in it. Look to purchase a Sumsung instead. Samsumg phones are made like tanks and will last much longer than the V180."
1,Buy some thing else,"The worst cell phone I have ever owned. PLEASE PLEASE dont waste your money on this paper weight. The screen gave problem on day 3, ever since then there has been some kind of problem or the other with this phone. We have two as part of a family plan and both have the exact same problem with the display screen. I hope Motorola people are reading this. Never again will I buy ANYTHING motorola. They just lost a valuable customer."
1,Lousy phone,"I have had 2 of these for nearly 1 year. One has constantly had terrible reception and drops calls. The other worked pretty well except for occasional dropped calls, but suddenly the screeen went blank. It still lights up but displays nothing. Not a good thing for trying to use the phone book or any other function.I'm lucky, I think because the warranty expires tomorrow (I think).I'm taking them back to Cingular tonight to see what happens.Avoid this phone at all costs. I'm going back to Nokia as soon as I can."
1,Buy Another Cell Phone!,The V180 has good voice quality and long battery life and is nice and compact. There the positive qualities stop. The inside LCD screen on my phone broke in less then three months with no improper or rough handling. I put the phone in my pocket. Thirty minutes later I took it out to place a call and the LCD color screen was broken--talk about an oversensitive phone! Avoid this phone; it's not worth it.
1,Terrible phone,"Phone is way over priced and not worth it. Very poor voice quality, speaker phone is terrible, and get dropped calls all the time. I've heard the horror stories on Motorola phones and this one proves the stories correct. Don't waste your time on Motorola phones, espcially this one!!"
3,"The Phone is so so, the problem is the Provider","Hi, this is my first review ever of a product.If you are like i was three months ago, looking for a phone and cell phone provider, be very careful with Cingular. For the phone a gave 3 stars, but cingular a give less than one.First, i live in Boston, and believe it or not, there are dead spots all over. Inside my house are dead spots, and my cell phone is useless.Second, have you ever had to cancel an account with AOL? Well, Cingular's customer service are just as bad. I bought a plan with rollover minutes, and they tell me now that there is not such a plan. I ask to talk to the supervisor and they tell me she is busy or that she won't be able to do anything for me.Do yourself a favor and stay away from Cingular!!"
1,Cingular Deceptive,"My review is on Cingular. I bought a phone w/service and was told I could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used. THEY LIE. THE PHONE DID NOT WORK IN MY AREA AND I CANCELLED THE NEXT DAY. THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR ACTIVATION even though it never worked in my area. If you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service, DON'T BUY from Cingular. Amazon will also do nothing to reimburse."
2,Boooooo V180,This phone was fairly reliable for about 6 months and then everything started going wrong. The the cover LCD screen went out and then the main screen went about a month later. I did a little surgery on it to discover the wires running from the main body of the cellphone to the flip cover were frayed from just normal usage. I blame this to faulty design on motorola's part.
2,Motorola V8100,"I purchased this phone in June. About a month after using it it started acting ""funny"". It kept ramdomly shutting off and the battery would not stay charged for more than 2 hours. I returned the phone to Cingular and they game me a new one. The ""new"" phone stays charged longer and doesn't shut off randomly BUT it will say that is has full signal, then you go to make a call and as soon as it connects the signal drops to nothing. It will say you have full signal while you are talking on it but the person on the other end can't hear you speak. Also, it will have signal in places that no cell phone would and have no signal in places that every cell phone would."
2,This phone is not too great......,"I do not really like this phone at all. I bought it off Ebay, which was a mistake to start off with. The seller had said it was barely used but I doubt it. At first the phone seemed nice but then i started to have the same problems other people have. My LCD screen cracked and there is now a big blob on it. Also sometimes when I call people I can hear them talk, but they can't hear me. It is rather strange. Yesterday I pulled out my phone and realized that the screen wont even come back anymore. I can still dial but I cannot even see the screen to see if I messed up dialing a number. I reccomend that if you are going to get a cell phone you should try another one first."
3,great phone,I got this phone last year for my birthday and im really happy with it. It isnt really hi-tech like some other phone out there but its really simple and easy to use for someone who just wants to use it for the reason phones are made: calling. The battery life is really good cuz I forgot the charger once when I went to a trip for 3 days and the phone lasted for the whole time. The ring tones are pretty good but i still download from the internet. The great thing about this phone is the USB port. The only reason i gave it 3 stars was cuz not all the units are great. I had to change this phone twice cuz the first time the screen was always blank and my second phone used to get disconnected after about 10 min but this third unit is great and works very well. The other downside is that it doesnt have that many hi-tech features that some of the other phones have but its still great.
1,Very Bad Workmanship,The quality of this phone is a joke. The first problem was the hinge of the flip up part. It started having problems almost immediately with with the hinge sticking and cracking from regular use. In less than a year in had shorted out completely. The only good things about it a couple of loud ringers. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,These phones don't last,My family bought three of these phones with a Cingular plan. None of the three phones lasted a year. Two of the three chargers also died. We've had other cell phones such as Nokia and Sony that were much more reliable. Motorola phones are junk.
3,Not an exciting pen.,"It does not flow very well and .5 is not ""micro"" but just mini.Note that it claims to have anti-forgery properties. If true, this is a big plus."
3,WAS NICE,Bought this as a gift. Was nice person seemed to like itDon't know what else to say.Think it was a little over priced. But what ya going to do.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"First of all like all of the other reviews this is a very small beanie, not the large one. This company also charges you a 10% restocking fee on every item. Buy from another seller even if this is the one you want."
4,Pleeplepher,"Following in the footsteps of his more famous cousin, Pleepleus, Pleeplepher is my official party mascot. He enjoys being cuddled by female guests, and riding on shoulders. He loves children, but hopes they don't pull too hard on his arms, legs and tail. He also likes to travel to parties and meet new people - the more exotic the location the better. Pleeplepher is an excellent listener, as he is very patient. When he is not attending parties, he can often be found in my kitchen guarding my tequila."
2,"Nice introduction, but no more","Well, at first I was petrified to find a book that sounded like it deeply explores the subject of kernel methods. But all in all, it did not quite achieve what I hoped for. As a practical approach, when it comes to implementation, it serves nicely as a reference. The deeper mathematical roots of kernels (especially when it comes to measure theory and functional analysis) are not dealt with at all or just scratched at the very surface. The notation is sometimes awkward, mentioning for example the representation of an object in a given vector space with respect to the basis. And: Too much copied and pasted from the former book about SVMs. Basically, reading papers of Carmeli, Aronszajn and others will give you a much deeper insight into the subject."
1,Sloppy,"Sloppy language, sloppy definitions, sloppy proofs.Constant repetitions do not add any clarity either."
3,TV works fine but the DVD is crap,Received my tv and it works just fine but the built in DVD is crap. You put in a movie and it freezes throughout the movie. We have had to resort to stopping and then restarting to view a complete movie no matter what the movie. I know it is just the DVD player because we can watch the same DVD on the smaller Zenith in the bedroom just fine. Other than that the TV itself works great...
2,Initial HDTV-262 with dvd player,"I search through Amazon for a good 26 in lcd tv and love the reviews for this Initial lcd tv. Unlike the last one one I purchase(32 in) I downsized and decided to go for a dvd combo. The TV was received in good shape and was easy to put together but hooking it up not only did a HDMI but a component hookup as well. the DVD player was good, the remote was fair but after a few days I could not turn the tv on. The red light was in standby mode. I change the remote batteries three time but when I push the on/off switch on the side of the tv it didnot turn it on. turn it off but not on. my daughter turned it on but when I tried to do it the set would not turn on. so I am sending it back today. I am waiting for a rma right now. I can't have a set that will not turn on by using the switch."
1,Too good to be true,"Excited to own my 1st LCD HDTV, setting up wasn't too difficult. The problem was the remote didn't work. I called Amazon and they directed me to the supplier. I called them and they told me to ship the bad remote back. When they recieve it they'll ship out the new one. Screw me once shame on you. Screw me twice shame on me. They're in CA. and now their TV is back in CA."
2,"It charges, but it's not easy to use.","The unearthly blue glow that emits from this cradle is annoying (to say the least). I didn't realize that it lit up when I bought this cradle. I don't think I would have bought it if I had known. It glows whether the DS is charging or not. It glows even after the DS is charged. It's just a freakin' annoying blue glowing thing.It DOES charge the DS, but it's very difficult to put the DS into the charger and just as difficult to take it out. It's a two handed process. If I have to use two hands to charge my DS, I might as well just plug it in.It was only ten bucks, but even so, I feel ripped off..."
3,This Is Cool But...,This is cool but the only problem is that if you want to play while it charges you can't do that with the dock because it is on a dock rather than connected to a cable.
3,Wish I would have known,"That this wasn't a necessary item for a new DS purchase. However, my experience with ordering and receiving this item were excellent. Now, we have a back up, that can't be all bad."
3,DS LITE RECHARGER not a game,"It works really good and takes very little room. I like that it lights up really bright, so you can't lose it."
1,The @$##% light won't go off,"Purchasing this I thought:1) It would come with it's own cable (it doesn't so now when I travel I have to unplug from the unit to take with me, might as well use the cord on its own)2) That the light would only be on when charging (NOPE, if it's plugged in, its on. This means you have to unplug from the back when your DS is done charging or the blue light will always be on)All this is is an extra step in charging your DS. Just use the cord"
1,Hole for your money,"This makes an adorable night light, if you enjoy a blue glow. However it adds nothing to the functionality of the Nintendo DS Lite. You won't save a step in recharging and it's a little difficult to dock with."
3,good,nice but buying it is a waste of money. cable doesn't come with it. i think it really doesn't matter if you plug it in directly your usb cable or plug your usb to this dock and then try to position your nintendo into the dock so it fits right into the usb hookup.it glows. that's all. there is nothing so exceptional about it.
2,It is what it is.,"Does exactly what you would expect (although quite useless).Requires the original charger for your DS to plug in the back, so do not order this as a replacement for a lost or broken charger.Nice way to display your DS, but not easy to dock and remove."
4,Looks great...,"...and actually doubles as a handy night light! (Mine sits on my night stand, and it's useful when I have to reach for something without turning on the light.) The only problem is that it's hard to plug your DS Lite into it without looking; the cradle isn't form-fitting, so the plug doesn't always align with the jack on the first try."
4,"It's Great! Oh, About That ""Glow""","This charges. Plug it in, it charges! Alright! It's a great dock! It does exactly what I wanted it to do and what I payed for.However, the glowing light can be a little annoying, but after a while i've gotten used to it. I hope it doesnt drain the electricity bill (Like $1 a month or more but probably not) so that's why I'm giving this a 4 out of 5. Mind the glow and you'll like it."
3,frustrating...,"Difficult to follow and moves too fast. Not sure how to rate this. She often cuts herself off from telling a story or explaining a behavior becasue the slides move so fast. Its frustrating to watch at times. Its obvious she has a wealth of experience however its difficult to access it through this video. Perhaps she needed more time to prepare. I will say that I did learn a lot and it is helpful to see actual behavior on film, however I'm not sure I would buy this again..."
5,A must for therapists working with dogs in practice,"This video offers excellent examples of dog behavior, and offers the contextual component that has been missing in many others. I am an occupational therapist who offers animal assisted therapy and international workshops on the topic. This has become one of the top resources that I recommend to all workshop attendees and interns. The information in this video has the potential to decrease liability issues surrounding dogs in work environments."
5,Must have,"Every person on this earth should see this. Even if you don't live with a pup, you would benefit from understanding what they are trying to communicate to you."
4,great information,This was recommended by an animal behavioralist . Good info for the dog owner. Surprised me. xxx xxx xxx x
1,A note on Evans's review from the author of Subversive Virtue,"As the author of Subversive Virtue: Asceticism and Authority in the Second-Century Pagan World (Penn State Press, 1995), I feel I need to alert readers to a peculiarity in Amazon. J.A.S. Evans's review, which appeared in the Canadian Journal of History, was the only negative review this book received but, unfortunately, is also the only review that comes up in Amazon when searching the title of my book. Amazon customers should know that the book received a number of excellent reviews including: W.H.C. Frend, The Journal of Ecclesiastical History 48 (1997): 302-13; Maud W. Gleason, History of Religions 38 (1998): 98; and C.L. Hanson, Choice 33 (1995): 348."
3,"overall, worth the price","This video is seamlesly edited with studio footage and a bunch of concert footage as a narrator hypes the living hell out of Yngwie's guitar ""mastery"" (wonder who wrote this?).The studio parts/lessons are supposed to be ""Master Class"", but I couldn't help but think they were closer to the ""Hyperactive & Attention Deficit Disorder class"" as all the solos and examples blur into the same muddy machinegun-fast lick, repeated (""blues"" at 200 beats per minute?). Yngwie may be a great guitarist, but the smugness and chronic show off get repulsive.However...it's an overall entertaining video for anyone interested in electric guitar, but don't buy for lessons unless you're a solid intermediate to advanced player. It doesn't particularly inspire me to pick up my guitar and play (my true test of a excellent instructional video), but I still would've given it 4 stars...if it weren't for the carelessly enthusiastic Yngwie fans/reviews."
2,"All the rage in the 80's ,but not now.","If you want to play like Malmsteen then I can fully recommend this DVD. Only problem is that this kind of fretwork was all the rage in the Eighties, so anybody listening to you playing like this nowadays (like a lot of the Shrapnel Record copyists) they will probably just fall asleep."
1,Yawnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you wanna sound cool on the guitar get a steve vai instrunction dvd or Bert Weedon. Avoid this though, Neo-classical electric just sucks!"
3,Kipor Sinemaster 2600 Watt Generator,"This generator is fairly quiet, light weight(60lbs), and starts well. I have used a microwave, radio, and portable DVD player at the same time with no issues.However,the generator could not run the 13.5 BTU air conditioner at first. I contacted Kipor Service but recieved little useful informatin. Further research indicated my AC needed a hard start kit in addition to the generator to acheive the starting amps (54amps). After installing the hard start kit I can now run my AC with the Kipor 2600W - my wife is happy too.The only thing to be noted is that my generator did not come the plug covers as shown. Kipor service has not responded back - yet."
5,good for emergencies,"Bought this generator in March 2006 to keep the fridge and some lights running during power outages, and it hasn't let me down yet. I've run it for up to 4 days continuously in 100-degree heat with no problems. Even after sitting for several months it's easy to start, and quiet enough to leave running all night without bothering neighbors (as far as I know). I like the automatic throttle (uses only as much fuel as needed for whatever load is attached). The fact that it's safe for use with computers is the real highlight though-- nothing worse than a power blackout combined with the feeling of being cut off from the outside world. I can't really say how much gas it consumes, but it will go all night with just the fridge running, then fill the tank in the morning."
3,Kipor use at altitude,"I have had the Kipor 2600 for a couple of months. we live west of Denver at 8,200 feet and camp as high as 10,500 in a Jayco featherlite travel trailer.We camp most often in National Forest property, which is free and secluded so having a reliable generator is useful.I had a local shop install a high altitude jet for better performance, however even at 8,200 feet when I start the microwave the generator bogs down on me.We don't need to run the A/C at that altitude but have use of a microwave occasionally is nice.Not sure what the issue is but I am dissappointed with the fact it cannot handle the microwave as advertised.I cannot say that Kipor support in the US is the best either.Jim Busby"
1,Tough Assembly and Missing Parts,"The product looks alright, but comes with no instructions to put it together. Also they missed some of the bolts and nuts for assembly and had some wrong parts.I agree with the other reviews tough to assemble especially with no instructions."
1,A BOX OF SADNESS,"Order this and listen for all the moaning souls that rush out when you open the box, because you've just acquired a little slice of Hades. Let's examine the claims:# Metal mechanisms for easy sofa to bed conversion# Strong and sturdy steel frame# Scratch resistant powder coat finish# Two-position front operational hinge mechanism# Easy to assembleThis brief passage contains at least five whopping lies. This is a jungle gym for Barbie dolls, not a piece of furniture. Heinous. If the Allies were like the American Furniture Alliance, we'd all be speaking German now."
4,"Decent opener,easy install.","Amazon shipped fast as usual.Instructions easy to follow.Opener very easy to assemble.Easy to set up,is pretty quiet.Lights up garage nicely with light on front and back.Overall would likely buy another if other opener in garage dies."
4,"Easy install, works great, no keyless entry included","The description says ""Wireless Keyless Entry System"" is included in addition to the two regular remotes. It isn't.Other than that, the install went great and it works great."
4,A GUYS' HOME PROJECT.,"This opener is well thought out when it comes to the home-owner installation. You need to be a bit handy as far as making the necessary hanger brackets as needed for your particular setup. I chose to use cotter pins instead of the cheezy ""springy looking keepers"" sent to secure the 3 mounting pins (you will know what I mean when you see them) although what they sent would work OK. The tec-talk about the remotes and possible problems made me a bit nervous but all worked well with no fuss. Purchased the wireless entry unit and it connected via the smart button to problem. Wall mounted wired control works well and gives an extra light when needed via a button and you can shut off the light after operation to save energy with ease. The wall mount control seems a bit flimsy though, needs a back to give it a bit more structure. Instructions seem well thought-out. Good opener for the money!"
4,"product mistake, was fixed","this product used to be on sale for a ridiculously low price, and my mother is an elementary school teacher so she jumped on the offer. Turns out, they mistakenly put the price of one pen for the whole set.We got an email saying that there was a mistake and that the price we paid (like $1) was refunded. We still got the shipment of a single red pen for free. My mother was a bit bummed that it was a mistake, but amazon dealt with it well and she got a free pend out of it, so she's not upset."
1,Bad Experience,"This product was marketed thru amazon as a ""Nokia 6100 Cellular Phone - GSM"". I was interested in the product and placed an order. When I got the shippment, I got only a cellphone battery and not the cellular phone. I was trying to contact the seller but couldn't.Even after getting the order confirmation notification, I sent a mail to the seller asking for the contents in the box. No replies.Its a very bad experience."
2,Style over substance,"I have generally enjoyed Soderbergh's films - more so the smaller-scaled ones like Out of Sight, Solaris and Sex, Lies & Videotapes than the big budgeted fares. This is, unfortunately, not one of his better efforts. I won't rehash the plot - it's less of a plot than a series of vignettes, in any case. But I do want to comment on the performance of the Sasha Grey which is competent but by no means stellar. I suspect the praises she received from some critics have to do with the fact that she was an adult film star and one usually does not associate good acting (in the traditional sense of the word) with professionals in this field. The film is beautifully shot, as is the norm of most of Soderbergh's work, but there just was not enough in the movie to keep me interested. It might have worked better as a semi-documentary on the escort profeesional but not as a feature film."
1,sasha sucks,this was incredibly bad. i am sorry but not one millimeter of a smile or sob or anything came over me. i felt quite frustrated at how the project takes itself seriously but shows no real content. completely empty and in my opinion a money manking scheme based on shock value. enough to ruin the career of any actor/director/producer.
1,??,Not bad. Her performance was ok. Very slow start... Started to fall asleep.. Not a movie I would recommend to a friend..
4,Top Shelf Soderbergh,"If you like Soderbergh's more challenging, smaller scale, experimental work, you'll find a lot to love about The Girlfriend Experience. If you're just showing up for porn star Sasha Grey, save yourself the 10 bucks unless you really want to see the girl act. She actually delivers a natural, credible performance as an escort who isn't nearly as sophisticated as she thinks she is.Told in a fractured, back and forth manner, the narrative is slight and challenging, but the jumbled chronology galvanizes your focus on what's happening. This isn't just the story of a call girl, it's really about loneliness, disconnectedness and the commodification of everything in the modern world, including love.Soderbergh is often a detached filmmaker, but this is one of his most emotionally resonant pictures since Solaris. The feeling is subtle, but it's there.This is also one of the most beautifully photographed films of the year."
4,Interesting Movie,"Fascinating view into a world I will never know (which is a good thing). Sasha Grey is very real in this movie. More so than some of the other actors - maybe because she is basically playing herself? Don't know but it doesn't matter.This movie affected me. I wanted to know why someone so beautiful would want to be an ""escort."" And when I googled the actress, her porn films sound really disgusting - far worse than what she is doing in this movie. So I'm thinking that in real life, she was probably sexually abused by her stepfather. That's just my guess.Her aloofness says to me that she was very hurt emotionally early in her life because she is now numb.It's really sad because she could have just gotten into regular modeling and I'm afraid that she is using her life to promote pedophilia, even though I don't think she realizes that."
1,The Girlfriend Experience (2009),This movie is boring and you don't see much of the girlfriend in it. The DVD case seems misleading because the movie was about different guys telling the girl about how bad the economy is. I threw this straight into the trash after watching it.
2,don't believe the hype!,"I head so much about this movie, mainly because the lead actress is a hardcore adult star. Everybody kept saying how great it was. I disagree. I found it boring and the ""acting"" not as good as some of the stuff I've seen on community access. It was like watching a dead pan comedy, except it's not comedy and there are no jokes.If you are a fan of Sasha Grey, you may enjoy this for the novelty. Otherwise, you're not missing anything."
1,worst movie ever,This would have to be the worst ever film. It was so boring it sent me to sleep. Never bother watching this film. I threw it straight in the bin.
3,Do Escorts Have Feelings?,"Let me say first off, it's a minor film, not very good. 3.3 stars at best. It was only with great hesitation that I even decided to watch Girlfriend Experience. But I had seen some of Sasha Grey's porno films, so I wondered: Would it be lurid and sexy? Would it just be more trash? The film was a real surprise for me. The greatest surprise was Sasha Grey. The woman can act. She has a natural sense of timing and emotional restraint. She knows how to say more with less. She knows how to be sexy without trying. You don't have to be male to wonder whether hookers can ever share genuine feelings with their customers. This film answers that question and the answer is yes. The greatest disappointment to me is why, when she has such natural acting ability, does Sasha Grey keep making porno films? Steven Soderburgh directed this film for godsake! Surely he can find more meaningful work for her in Hollywood."
3,SASHA GREY,It was not what I expected.You get to see Sasha naked a few times and she is easy on the eyes but overall bad story line.She could cross over to mainstream films and be a bigger hit by keeping her clothes on since we know what she looks like without them.
2,An objective look at the skin trade,"This movie is the latest in a long line of Hollywood productions to take advantage of America's obsession with escort women. Starring porn star Sasha Grey, this movie follows the life of a high-class call girl over the course of one week in New York City. The lead character, Chelsea, is self-employed, and the movie is about how she runs her ""business"", promotes herself, finds customers, does her job, and try to expand. Along the way, we see glimpses of her going thru a series of interviews with an investigative reporter who bears a striking resemblance to Ralph Nader. The movie is not about the sex, of which we see none whatsoever. Instead, it is about how she handles herself both emotionally and as a self-employed businesswoman. There is little comedy, less romance and only some drama. And for those who think this is a porn flick, let me say that that this movie deserves between a R and a PG-13 rating. Overall, not that bad, but not that good either."
4,"What a ""dream"" girl, call Sasha and make a date.","Sasha Grey is a porno star (she won an award for her performances).Her customers are long-term. They view her as a girlfriend and not a prostitute. I won't ruin her line, but her character explains that she becomes what her customer's want and not her real self.No, this is not a great movie. However, it deserves more attention that it's received.As players walk around the pool table looking for their shot, let me say that one view of the movie would be guys are looking for love in all the wrong places. Yet another view is these men want and are willing to pay for the ""dream"" girl - the dream being what they want at the moment since they eventually change girlfriends.Thoughtful movie."
2,Intriguing for a little while,The story line was a bit interesting but did drag on for a bit. Probably a bit too much character development. Acting was so-so.Spoiler alert:The ending is weak.
1,Contender for Worst Film of the Decade,"While some may praise the works of Steven Soderbergh, this film is one of the worst films I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. Sasha Grey delivers a cardboard performance which lacks the depth necessary for the role of a prostitute. Her connection to the adult entertainment industry built buzz for the film, but her performance is nothing special. The movie focuses more on people talking about the economy than holding a cohesive narrative and its jumpy plot line is a disaster. My advice is to not waste your money on the product when there are plenty of other drama films which deserve attention. If you want a more accurate examination of human condition and relationships, check out Marc Webb's 500 Days of Summer."
4,To All of You Haters!,"this is the best album of rage against machine. It is really good, and has some incredible Metal classics on it like, Killing in The Name of, Bombtrack, and Freedom. You stupid haters are just jealous that these guys are great musicians. And to those of you who are dissing their name, wtf? are you brainless. Rage Against the Machine? as in rage against the goverment and the messed up system? idiots. lol. Anyway, great ablum, right up there with Metallica."
5,prower to the people,"This is a trly amazing C.D. It has everything good music sould have:cool riffs, good beats and intelagent lyrics. Zack De La Rocha's policticaly motavated lyrics show no mercy at exposeing the perjaduses and inequailties of capitalisium and socity in general.This is all set to Tom Morello's riffs and awesome distorted guitar souds.This albaum puts all mindless rap/metal bands ,ie. Limp Bizkit, to shame. A have for anyone who likes hard , smart, kick a$$ music."
5,BEST ALBUM I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!!,"This is by far the best album i have ever bought!!you can listen through all the tracks with out skiping one, its a piece of pure skill!! the riffs for each track blow your mind and the lyrics are so clear and amazing!! my best traks are 'killing in the name', 'know your enemy'and'fistfull of steel' but all the traks are class!! if u even think of buying this album, do. its emense!! if u have any of R.A.T.M. other albums this is by far the best one. Buy it or you should be asamed of yourself!"
3,Decent,"This is good as far as rap/rock goes. Zack's voice does get monotonous, and I don't really agree with their extreme left wing politics. The music is alright though. Check out Audioslave, the vocals on there are brilliant. Than again, it's Chris Cornell, so can you expect anything less?"
5,best cd I own,"from the first bass note of bombtrack until the final chorus of freedom this cd will keep you rocking. If you can sit still during ""killing in the name of,"" check yourself for a pulse. I could write forever on how good this cd is. If you don't own it buy it. You will not regret it."
5,Wake Up!!,"RaTM self titled debut has to to be one of the best album of this decade. Zach De La Rocha is a very gifted song writer and combined with the best gutarist of this generation - Tom Morello - this album is a rock/rap classic. Rage is the only band that actually saying something worth listening to. You may not agree with their politics but at least they are saying something other than doing it all for the ""Nookie"" or boasting of their supposed virtuality (whilst in fact many of these bands are very much powerless.) I mean, how many musical groups post a book list on their web page with authors varying from Karl Marx to Henry Miller to James Baldwin? And for all of you who say that Zach is not much of a rapper, I begged you to purchase Lyrict Lounge Volume 1 and listen to the sound C.I.A (Disc 2, track 10) where you can hear his flow. The companero can rhyme.p.e.a.c.e"
4,Irresistable Metal-Funk,"The fact that Zach De La Rocha's lyrics are at their awkward worst doest not change the fact that this is the most musically inspired album that RATM released, and certainly the best rap-rock record ever made. No matter how you slice it, ""Take the Power Back"" is the funkiest song about eurocentric school-teaching ever put to pen. A must for anyone disappointed with Audioslave's muzzling of Tom Morello's inimitable guitar."
5,killing in the name,"this is a rare album. it isn't often i hear such a great record. rage against the machine was a ground breaking band that changed the world and music forever. now, five years after ""renegades"" their music is still fresh, and is still heard by many. if there is one record i recommend ABOVE ALL it would be this one, and RATM's other records. they are truly one of the greatest bands to ever live. their message was in every song. they had several messages, from the government and the things we can do to change things to the unjust trial of abu Jamal. this is truly a band that deserves a fresh listen. may the legacy of rage against the machine live on."
2,the front cover is great!,this is awful material! the songs tell about justice! the riffs are quite Ok but i would like to have more intelligent lyrics like slayer's!!!
1,"Signed by Sony and Air on MTV.. yet, ""anti corporation""","Hypocritcal money hungry untalented garbageoh yes, the people who claim to hate the system air on MTV and are signed by sony. this kinda of music only appeals to little 11 year olds who know nothing about the economy and government.not only are the lyrics stupid, but the idea of mixing rap and rock is just awful.the ""singer"" is one of the worsts of all time. there is no particular guitar talent as for the rest of the band, THEY SUCK."
1,This is the worst band is the universe,These guys are terrible. They have absolutely no talent and they act really afeminite. This is music for the mindless. Even Sugar Ray is better than these guys!
5,This is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, i got this and i thought, man this will not be very good, after i listened to this i died and relived 5 times in a row thats how good it is!!!i love it its amazing!bye!"
4,my friend,she made me listen to this album at least 20 times. i now have the song Township Rebellion in my head. It is the worst song on the album but the best. It is an incredibly mad song. if rage againts the machine made the song Township Rebellion in a serious quest to make good music than they are mad and could possibly benefit from counselling.i now like all the songs because they all drive me insane. especially the one where Zac keeps shouting about american dreams at the end.if i ever TRIED to make an album which is mad it probably would not come out as mad as this. but this is a good album so i am not being horrible to rage against the machine fans. i am not generally a fan of rock music but i like this.if i ever saw Zac De La Rocha carted away by men in white coats i would not be surprised. not at all. he makes very scary music.i will never buy my own personal copy of this album because it would confuse me to my core. guaranteed.
5,Kiss away my pain!!!,"One of the GREATEST bands that ever set foot on this planet we call Earth! (Led Zepplin and Nirvana don't count, they're from planet ROCKYOURSOCKSOFF!) HAHHAHAHAHHAH! I will laugh and point fingers at anyone who says Rage Against the MAchine was a bad band! They are so intense, they made me cover my ears and take a crap in my pants because it was so awesome! I am the best guy alive!So to sum up my incomprehensible meander, buy this album! Because man I am so damn drunk! HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAH_PEACE OUT AND REMEMBER TO NOT EAT TWINKIES BEFORE SHOOTING VODKA!"
3,"Yes, they are hypocrites, but...","if you like loud angry music and want a change from your old stuff, check this album out. I admit that I had to play it a few times before I started to enjoy it. Yes, the lyrics are cheesy, but the actual music is good for working out to, or doing busy work at your job. Take this album for what it is(Loud grooving music) instead of a horribly flawed commentary on society. Those who attempt to analyze this album on that level are missing the point entirely."
4,This album is good,"This album has a lot of good songs on it. The best songs are Bullet In The Head, Killinng in The Name Of, and Freedom. This is thier best record. This is one of two albums that I can stand of the genre Rap/metal."
5,best cd ever made,"i think that the self titled rage against the machine cd is the best ever made. the guitarist tom morello does some of the most wicked and original guitar riffs ever even conceived of. In short, this cd kix a$$ and everyone should have a copy of it"
5,Twice as good as Evil Empire!,When I got Evil Empire I thought it was the best cd I had ever heard. Then I bought Rage Against the Machine a year later and realized that I hadn't lived before I heard that cd. They have more meaning in their music than any of the fakes that are only together to make money. Must Have.
4,Kick you in the teeth knock you down verbal melt-down,I listen to this music and it makes me alive to the fullest push the boundries make it yours.
4,Anger is a Gift,"Few bands can do more with Bass, Drums, Guitar and Vocals than Rage Against The Machine. If poof of this fact is what you are looking for, buy the band's self titled debut. This album is Rage Against the Machine at their best and most pissed off. Listening to songs like Wake Up and Killing in the Name, you can't help but feel the festering rage of Zach de la Rocha. Sure, his lyrics can seem a bit cliche, but they are convincing none the less. Who else could pull of the refrain ""F**k you, I won't do what you tell me""? Zach's politically motivated poetry, remeniscent of the best of 1970s punk music, is balanced perfectly by the vurtuistic guitar of Tom Morello who has always been a very good guitarist, and continues to improve. I considder this record a must have in any rock & rol music collection."
3,never recieved this cd,"I ordered this on the 29th od december, an never recieved it from the supposed shiping location......."
2,Not convinced,"After listening to this album several times I have concluded that it is way overrated and doesn't deliver the goods despite of all the 5 star reviews here. Sure its better than linkin park and the lot but that doesn't say much at all. Musically this album cannot compete with with other far more interesting acts of that era such as soundgarden and RHCP whom displayed far more class and intelligence in their sound.The lyrics and vocals sink things much further as they come across as very pretentious and quite obnoxious, with little variation.Halfway through the album I get really tired of it all. Certainly impressionable and anti-everything types will love this but to me what could have been more becomes rather annoying."
3,More tantrum than rage,"They've got the hooks, it's a cohesive album, but it's pretty forgettable apart from one or two standout tracks that got played to death in clubs in the early-90s. I have higher hopes for Audioslave -- Zack de la Rocha was the weakest link."
1,"hypocrites, phonies and posers....","'Rage Against the Machine' should now change their name to 'Part of the Machine' since their record label, Sony, is one of the biggest corporate 'machines' on the planet.As far as I'm concerned, their 'rage' is just a big marketing ploy by Sony and MTV to get the little teen or twenty-something headbangers to go out and buy their CDs. I wouldn't give these liars and posers a dime....If I could give them a minus 10, I'd do so."
5,R.A.M,Rage Against the Machine is the best band. I was playin g.t.a san andreas the other day and killing in the name came on and i just pulled over to the side of the road and put the volume all the way up...even tho i have the cd.
5,Real rap/rock,This is A great cd if you are looking for some real rap/rock and not Limp Bizkit or Linkin park...then I suggest you invest in this cd.
3,"Yeah, it's overrated. Get over it...","But at least these guys were original. That earns them a star. The songs ""Killing in the Name"", ""Bombtrack"", ""Take the Power Back"", and ""Bullet in The Head"" are great. That earns them another star. The last star goes for influence. Think about how many bands this band has influenced. Every rap-metal band has some influence from Rage Against The Machine.So that's my review. You can buy the CD, or you don't have to. Your choice."
5,Rage at its Best,"Great CD! Their best ever! Pick it up, and if you don't like it, then you are a capitalist,a nd you shouldn't be listening to Rage anyway."
3,Good debut but thats about all,"This is a strong debut.Being that i got into Rage after the release of The battle of LA, i wasnt forced to JUST listen to this.Dont misunderstand me, i like this CD, but Its definetly not as strong as the battle of LA, and its now where near Evil Empire's level.This cd, just FEELS different for some reason. Its more raw than their later work which appeals to some but it may turn off others.The best songs on this cd are:Killing in the name of(a rage classic), Take the power back (which has an almost funk bass element that isnt present on any other cd), Wake up , and Township rebellion.The others are merely ok.I wouldnt reccomend this CD to anyone just getting into rage. Id go with The Battle of LA, then Evil mpire then this CD(Renegade can be purchased at any time)."
5,Genius,"This is without a doubt one of the most meaningful albums ever released in the 1990s'. This band really has a lot to say. The lyrics are deep, if somewhat hard to understand. The guitar is rockin' and immovative. Tom Morrello (i think that's how you spell it) is one of the most innovative guitarists I've ever seen. This is a great CD and definatley worth owning; pick it up if you dont already have it. Check out Battle of LA and Evil Empire here at Amazon too."
5,The most powerful album ever,"Of all the music in the world, this album contains the most powerful and influetial music I have ever heard. No album has ever managed to change so many ideas and inform so many people as Rage Against the Machine has. Rage is the greatest, most talented band of the 90s, and this album shows it.It's just so amazing that they can manage to put such strong ideas into such perfect music. This album contains everything you'll ever need to hear."
5,Rap/metal doesn't get any better than this!!!!,"This album is just unbelievable, one of the best ever. Songs with a very strong political message and unbelievable guitar riffs just can't miss. This album is also proof that rap did do something good, influence these guys. Tom Morello is the best riff player of all time, backed by great bass and drums, with political man Zack de la Rocha at his side. This is their best album, everything on it is good. ""Killing In the Name"" is a classic, ""Freedom"" is awesome, ""Take the Power Back"" really gets you pumped, ""Know Your Enemy"" is cool, ""Bullet in the Head"" rules, everything on this album is great. Those who think Limp Bizkit are the kings of rap/metal, look again, check out these guys. These guys are the kings of rap/metal without a doubt. You don't have to like rap to like this (hey, I hate rap with a passion and these guys are one of my favorite bands). So stop reading this and BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!"
5,Raw,"RATM came out so heavy and angry on this their debut and realistically could never match that freshness factor again, especially as their pockets subsequently became filled with capitalist wealth. From Bombtrack to Bullet In The Head this album does exactly what it promises and rages against the unjust, disparate system we find ourselves in. Hopefully Zach will hit us with a solo album soon, especially as the remaining members have gone apolitical with the straightforward (Yet undoubtedly excellent) rock of Audioslave."
4,Revoluntionary!,"An album from the early 90s that sounds so similar to what we have today is revolutionary. Rage paved the way for many of these garbage bands we have today that sing about lying in bed and running away from some girl that broke their heart. But these new bands have mucked it all up and forgot to sing about what is relevant in our nation and the world. Rage may use profanity a lot, but they have to get their point across somehow, or else no one would listen to them. Listen to this cd with an understanding of our country and what its done before you question and expel it. This is the first bombtrack Rage fans!"
5,Living up to the name,"Rage Against the Machine is entirely original. Zach de le Rocha brings a hip hop feel to the music, Tom Morello rules in creative guitar techniques, Tim C. keeps a strong and sometimes jazzy bass line going, and Brad Wilks backs it all up with his excellent beat. RATM's music style portrays the first word in it's name, RAGE. The lyrics also put in the ""against the machine."" Excellent music, excellent message."
5,fantastic album,This has got to be one of the best rock albums ever written. The hard core beats and thought provoking lyrics really make it a cd that everyone must own.
1,Horrible,This Cd is the worst I've ever bought. I bought it thinking it was going to be good and took it back the next. There is one word to describe this CD and that is BAD.
1,Rage Against THIS Machine,"Horrible communist rock album by political activists turned musicians. This self-titled debut is best seen and not heard. And if you plan on hearing them, I suggest you wear ear plugs. This is mearly a plea for a socially acceptible rebellion that ends up being trendy. If you think watching CHILDREN OF THE CORN is what turns your kids against you, think again."
5,Great first effort,"Very solid album that I never heard until Guitar Hero II. I bought this album for Killing In The Name Of, but I have since discovered a lot of other good music on this album. RATM was one of my favorites when they were in their prime."
5,one of the best ever,"Rage's first album is by far their best. Tracks 1,2,3,5, and 9 are some of the best songs I've ever heard. If you have one of the other Rage albums and like it, then you should definitely buy this one."
5,READ THIS,"This cd is so amazing. I own all of their cds and this one only has 10 songs but, its way better than the other rage cds. It is so good! i cant say my favorite song(s) they all are sweet. High quality rage, this cd is so good. stop reading this and go buy it, ..."
5,Renegades in the early 90's.,"Rage Against the Machine began in 1992, and their first album became a huge hit. Zach de la Rocha is the lead singer for Rage and his amazing rap vocals is what makes this band come alive. Tom Morello brings out his roaring guitar and crazy effects and amazing solos that gives every song its definition. Every song in the album are amazing and you can never get tired listening to them. Great songs include Bombtrack, Killing in the Name, Know Your Enemy, and Freedom. With creative lyrics and great definition to the band, Rage Against the Machine is one great rock band that everyone should know about."
4,First track skips,"It's a great album, only problem is that the first track (Bombtrack) is skipping in a few parts of the song. No signs of significant damage, ordered from amazon store. Should I send back?"
5,Incredible,"This is definitely Rage's best (and first). Take my word for it and go buy it NOW. It opens with bombtrack, one of the best songs on there then follows with killing in the name of. Thats a cool song but just dont let your parents listen to it. Know your enemy and wake up are also awesome. This cd rocks. Tim Morello is amazing along with Zach de la Rocha's voice. The drummer really brings out the bass (Tim Bob) well. A must have."
1,FLASH: Rich Capitalists Praise Socialism!!,"This has to be one of the best oxymorons in the past 15 years. Filthy rich capitalists known as Rage Against the Machine made their millions by praising the virtues of socialism.If these [guys] grew up in the old Soviet Union (and Tom's got the old hammer and sickle on his guitar), they would be piss-poor unhappy rebels without a cause. Because these [guys] grew up in the great USofA, they are very rich rebels still without an intelligent cause.I don't blame RATM though--they sure pulled the wool over the eyes of millions who bought their cd's. Well done boys!"
1,awful,"1/2 star, actually. How can you Rage Against The Machine when you have become part of the machine, as this band has"
1,Amateur CD,"Raging against everything from the American flag to Taco Bell restaurants, it's easy to see where the band gets its name from. Unfortunately, their debut CD doesn't quite live up to the reputation that the group has acquired over the years. Their lyrics and song content are difficult to understand for non-activists (myself included) and the guitar riffs/bass lines aren't that great, either. While the band's sophomore album, Evil Empire, also shares the same fate lyrically, lead singer Zack De La Rocha definitely has more of an artistic flow while the band members managed to create music that sticks in your head. On the debut CD, the only track really worth listening to happens to be ""Killing In The Name"" which has received a healthy amount of airplay. Go ahead and skip this one and check out Evil Empire instead."
4,14 years later this album did not start a war... (an idiot president did),"14+ years later... still love the slap bass lines, the loopy shrill solos, the bombastic drumming, the interesting song structures, the pounding accented notes and memorable Dropped D riffs that tattoo this album...14+ years later...still don't know what Zack was going for and I still don't listen to anything he says beyond ""Take it back the other way!"" and ""uggh!""It's a shame that Suicidal Tendencies's side project ""Infectious Grooves"" never broke bigger from this era. That band was equally talented and funky as hell without the Marxist meat beat manifesto....but Rage $old records and maybe some weightlifting jocks rented a Robert Redford film to learn more about Leonard Peltier. Ahh... sweet accomplishment!"
4,Settle for Nothing? NEVER! Against the Government!,"Rage Against the Machine blew the world with their self-titled debut album. ""Bombtrack"", ""Freedom"", ""Take the Power Back"", ""Killing in the Name"", and ""Bullet in the Head"" are still their most popular songs in live gigs...or were...because there's no more Rage Against the Machine...at least the original one. The songs about the USA government and what they are doing are quite brave ones. And if they could, they would destroyed the US government. The songs are quite violent and sad. But like they say...Anger is a Gift!!! Their music is a mixture of hip hop, funk, and heavy rock. Well, that's kinda dangerous compination.Stars: Settle for Nothing, Killing in the Name, Freedom"
5,Great Book,I absolutely loved reading this colorfully worded book. I am thinking of moving to St. Croix and this book enlightened me about a few things I didn't know about and need to consider. The author is very down to earth and explores all aspects of moving to the island. A must read for anyone thinking of moving to St. Croix.
4,EFE,"Educational Funny and Entertaining. This is a good easy read, and if going to the island, after reading the book, I'd like to meet the author."
4,A great workout,"As a personal trainer, I would like to address some of the concerns that have been brought up in regards to this program. First of all, ab and core target work does not require the intensity of PX90 or insanity as many people feel the need to compare this program to. He definitely knows his ""abcentrics"" and he uses the right techniques to carve out those muscles. It is not advertised as a high intensity program such as the ones people are comparing it to. I LOVED it, in fact I brought a lot of his moves to my fitness classes. He might have wanted to increase some of the cardio circuits but it still ""delivered"". I highly recommend this product"
3,Trying to like it!,"I love P90X and was hoping this would be similar. I'm still going to give it a chance. It's only been one week. I am hoping to see some results. I find the host annoying with his ""poo's"" at the end of things. I am also feeling some pain, not in a good way, in my knees, shoulders, back, and arms from the past few days. I never had any with P90x, only had good pain with that (soreness from using the muscles). Some of his moves are hard to get, the punch sequence."
2,BORING!,"I bought this product because beachbody is a trus ted company. However, I don't think this dvd series should be in the beachbody family. I think you can get results with the program is you can stick with it long enough. It's so boring. You do the same moves over and over in 3 cycles and that's on every dvd. Personally, I can stand repetition. Not to mention, the trainer Brett can be quite annoying. I finally decided to return the product and to just stick to Turbo Fire and other less boring beachbody products. Plus, the Rev anthem is annoying. ""Rev it high, rev it low...etc"""
1,I did break a sweat......eventually,I've completed P90X and Insanity so I had high hopes for this being a BeachBody product. There is no comparison. This was one of the worst workouts I've ever seen. It looked like there was little to no thought that went into the exercises performed and the order in which they were performed. Brett has no personality and is painfull to watch. BeachBody really missed the mark with this one. I actually returned the videos.
5,Great Program for All,"I started the Rev Abs program 2 weeks ago and feel stronger, less stiff (I'm 48), and just better overall. The program is a little tough at the start for anyone if you've been inactive for a while. It takes a few workouts to regain flexibility. I already see results in my body tone, my back pain is completely gone, and my mental attitude is improved. I find that when I skipped a day, I regret it because I miss the positives of the program. After 2 weeks, I have not experienced any weight loss (I haven't changed my diet at all) but my body is toned and improved. This is the first program I've ever been able to stick with for this long. I think the difference is that this program is focused, sensible, and well-thought out."
1,Awful,"So disappointed in this series of videos I don't know where to start. Same exercises over and over and over. Loved P90X and thought this would be along the same lines but concentrating on abs. UGH, what a waste of money"
2,Pretty weak,"Got this as a supplement to P90X and Insanity, and I returned it immediately. Tried a couple of the DVDs and didn't even make it through any of them. Granted, they bill it as a workout that's not a ""graduate"" program as Insanity and X are, but the day I tried it out was after already doing a P90X workout. After turning it off I went to walk my dog and got about the same workout I would have from the DVD, without the annoying instructor. Returned for a refund, minus shipping and return shipping, but happier to be out the $22 or so for shipping as opposed to over $90 for something I would never have used again.Note: I give it two stars as MAYBE for people who aren't in shape could benefit from this. But my thinking is if you can walk a flight of stairs without stopping halfway, this will not be a challenge."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,This was not all its cracked up to be. Don't get me wrong. It works ok. But not nearly a challenging as it could be. It more a leg work out than abbs. I got this because I had done P90X. Which was the hardest work out program. I was hoping this work have compared to that. The RevX is too easy. It also should have focused more on the core and abbs like it said it would
2,"Has Some Gems, but not enough","For those who don't know this book is basically a list of 2002 ways to say I love you. It geared towards both men and women. When reading through this book I found that most of them are actually common sense, and that most people don't need to be told that. At the same time there are some good ideas here and there. I am not sure that it is really worth the money in buying this book since all it is is just a list of things/ideas. I think they could have trimmed the book down to less than 2002, and maybe give more details ways to say you love someone. Maybe if the book had some elaborate ways that people have done nice things. At the same time I balence this review with the fact that I did find some gems in it."
1,Romantic Interiors by Ann McArdle,"This book shows many photos of homes the author views as romantic, but gives no actual decorating advice. It was not what I had wanted, nor expected."
3,Just Pictures...,"This book is mostly pictures. All the writing consists of is the introduction and the captions. If you are looking for how-tos and projects this is not the book for you. However, if you are looking for inspiration this book might be helpful. The designs are very diverse and some are quite distinctive such as the Norwegian stuga bed and '50s retro kitchen. If you like looking at pictures of beautiful designs then give it a try."
3,"They do the job, but not smoothly","These pens work great, but then suddenly the ink goes dry and I have to readjust my angle to get it flowing again. I am disappointed but they still write, just not as smoothly as I'd hoped."
4,Pretty good pen.,"It's a good pen. Not leaky, writes smooth, but doesn't feel like it isn't a pen. Feels like a really nice sharp pencil as it dances across the page, leaving an elegant, thin line after it."
1,Like somone said here. pen runs dry quickly,I love these pens usually. I always buy them in stores but it seems like the ones I got from Amazon just have no ink in them? they are very uneven and like what someone else here said they pens run out of ink and then you have to scribble to get the ink to come out again and then it writes ok for a few words then stops again? Maybe amazon got a bad batch of these pens I dont know.
5,Love these,Amazing pens! box of 12 is more than enough to keep me loving them and then some. I gave some to my coworkers because they always want to take my pens. Writes amazingly if you like the smaller point pens =)
4,"excellent pens, but only 11 in the box?","these pens look rather dapper and stylish and write very fluidly and smooth, however, i can only leave four stars because only 11 pens came in the box.otherwise, this item would have received a a perfect five star score. it arrived in only one day (with amazon prime 2 day shipping), the box was not damaged or torn in any way, and all the 11 pens seem to be in good condition.by far, these pretty much the best pens i have come across on amazon considering price and quality. this is fluid thick ink which lasts a long time and doesn't smudge when you write. consistent thickness and comfort."
5,Great Checkbook Pen,I love these pens. I use it mostly for my checkbook register and checks. The ink is resistant to being washed and the fine tip makes filling out the register easy. I used one pen for close to 2 years so it lasts a long time. When writing on paper and it dries fast so there are no smears.
5,Very nice pens.,"I've been a teacher for the last 20 years and I have used the uni-ball pens almost exclusively in that time. I buy my own pens and these are not cheap pens by any means, but I do a lot of writing and I like to have a pen that I know will write well, not skip or sputter and that just generally feels good in my hand. The uni-ball fits the bill. It leaves a nice, sharp line and makes writing not so much of a chore. If you buy them I hope that you are as happy as I am with them and thanks for taking the time to read my review."
4,"Good Product, Good Price","Held up well, seem to have a sufficient supply of ink. Writes smoothly for a micro point pen"
5,My Favorite,"I have used these pens for years; easy to write with, last a long time, and easy to toss out when they run out. I love how they are sold in 12 packs. Have you ever been at your wits end because there is no pen anywhere? Well since I don't usually carry a pen around, I have a tendency to not have a pen when I need it most. So the 12 pack of my favorite pen is convenient to flood my life with pens. I have three or four everyplace conceivable; my favorite pen is always a few feet away. I never look for something to write with."
1,Really?,"I haven't found one pen that will let me write more than a few letters before it runs out of ink. My homework looks like a ""Wheel of Fortune"" puzzle. I've tried 8 different pens, and I've tried varying the pressure on the pen and the types of paper. No luck. These are going back. I used to trust Uniball's reputation, but these are terrible."
1,Pretty bad,"If you generally use a lot of pressure this pen will be perfect, but since I don't think I you should have to etch into a notebook in order to write some notes--I hated this. Also the pen itself is very thing, making it difficult to grip and write with. The ink is too bold for my tastes and tends to bleed onto the second page. I thought this was a great deal, but now I have 12 useless pens. Honestly, I would prefer the cheapo Bic pens over this. It then again, that's just me."
2,Good Pen for a couple of days,"I bought these pens because they were rated so highly on Amazon. Well, either I got stuck with a bad box or my expectations were too high. These pens were terrific the 1st time writing with them, the ink doesn't bleed or leak and writes smoothly on the paper. After a couple days of use however,each pen became worthless to me because it apparently ran out of ink."
1,These pens write too thin. You have to push really hard to let the ink flow smoothly.,These pens write way too thin. You have to push really hard to let the ink flow smoothly. Doesn't really worth it.
1,Leaks all over!,"I love how these pens write and I am picky! I have ink stains everywhere though because I tend to leave the cap off. Oh, this is annoying! It got all over my couch and new purse so these pens are a huge disappointment. Too bad because the price is so nice."
3,Midnight Club3 DUB edition,"I havent had much luck with this game, it seems to keep jumpingjust like it did before . I put other games in my system and theydont jump, Im not sure if I can send this one back? It was giftand I havent had much fun with it cause it keeps giving me problems.What can I do to get another one sent to me?"
5,NFSU2 doesn't stand a chance.,"I dont have this game but I just went over my friends house who borrowed it from his cousin and OMG is it incredible. I only played it for like an hour but it is the best game I have ever played in my life! MC3 DUB Edition had three cities each 140 miles long. NFSU2 only has one city that's 125 miles long. Thats a big difference. Plus, the cars in MC3 look a lot better. One thing that I find cool is that theres 2 kinds of boosts; Nitrous and the other one I think it's called slipstream Turbo. I want this game so bad. Im doing so many chores around my house it's kind of sickening. But eventually it will be worth it. I dont want to give away all the cool stuff so ill just leave that to you.For everyone who loves racing games, this is a MUST BUY!!!!"
1,"Ron Weitz ""Looser""",Hi I am a loser and i think this game stinksP.S:i am the worst video game and sports player
1,"Great Game, But Only One City Is Unlocked When You First Play","I like the game so much, but it is the way they do the cities, they had all cities availbile in the first game, in 2 and 3 they had 1/3 of the cities unlocked.Here are some grades for the game:Cities/Unclocked 3/3- F-Cars A++Graphics A+++So in conclusion, when you buy this game, do not expect all 3 cities to be unclocked. This game is an overall good game, but the cities are not unclocked, one is, the sucky city of San Diego, I would rather race in one of the three cities once a week.I quit playing the game because all cities are not unclocked.Break Started: Sunday, July 17, 2005Break Ends: Wednesday, May 25, 2006"

ROCKSTAR = FASLE ADVERISTING.... the cover and title r very misleading...still its ok worth 2 stars 4 fun 1 STAR OVERALL...lord of the rings rox y'all!
5,Awsome game!,Midnight Club 3 is the best street racing game ever!The features in this game are cool!I love the cars and the cities!I really recommend this game!
4,"Fun, I guess","This game get's very tedious after a while. The game is fun at first because everyone is at equal difficulty. However, as you get to about 14% done with the game the difficulty all of a sudden jumps up. The races are really hard to do also and I'm starting to think that the traffic actually aims for your car. You would think that you would get out of the way of a speeding vehicle, but no they crash right into you.However, this game is fun. You get to fully customize your car, provided that you unlock all the required components. You also get to by some pretty cool looking cars, provided you have the money. I wish, however, this game had a better racing engine. It seems like they kind of rushed this game out a little, but if you like racing games you will probably love this game, so go ahead and buy it."
5,A lovable canine hero,"In this, the second of Virginia Lanier's suspenseful and entertaining series, we're treated to more adventures of Jo Beth Sidden, feminist, good ol' girl and woman of much guile. Her cleverness and resourcefulness rise to the occasion in a number of subplots, but the main mystery concerns the search for a man who's been buried alive. Old friends from ""Death in Bloodhound Red"" return, and we meet new ones, including a love interest for Jo Beth (a relationship that starts off most inauspiciously and hilariously). The real hero, however, is a blind-from-birth bloodhound puppy of exceptional brilliance named Bobby Lee. He's a truly lovable character, delightfully portrayed. Dog people and readers who like a Southern setting and/or a strong female protagonist should not miss this series."
3,mildly humorous,"This was neither a great or terrible book. The author deals with the oppressions of living under the Soviet regime light-heartedly. This is a new angle compared to other books I have read on the subject. It is not particularly well written. I had to go back and reread certain parts to figure out what she was talking about. Also, I thought I was buying a book on a Jewish topic, and in fact the author is not Jewish, her husband is."
5,nice!!!!,"With this CD I just got back to my roots,Felipe is Indeed one of the best Boleristas of the world!"
4,Pretty good,"Pretty good product, I've ripped it apart to compare with the competitive products (don't ask why, work) and the Philips stacks up well."
5,best blow dryer I have ever used,"I love this blow dryer. I have told family and friends about it who have told family and friends about it. it dries your hair faster than normal blow dryers and my hair has been more healthy looking since I have started using it. I have no more fly aways (the broken pieces of hair that stick out) like I did with my other hair dryers. I take it with me even when I am only going away for a day. I also love where they put the control buttons. with my old dryer I use to accidently shut off my dryer all the time when drying my hair, with this one I never have that problem since they are recessed and I don't hit the controls unless it is intentional."
1,This Item is Cheaper Elsewhere,"This item is actually the Long Shot CS-6. It is not some other Long Shot Blaster. You can find this item almost anywhere for at least $18 less. When the description includes ""Only 4 left"" or however many, this is just a deceptive ploy by the seller to get you to think it is a discontinued item or something like that. Do yourself a favor and look very closely at what this item is and compare to the Long Shot CS-6 - you will see it is the exact same item. I can't really comment on the Long Shot CS-6 itself because it will be a Christmas gift for my son - one that cost me approximately $25 extra due to a deceptive seller and an ignorant buyer (me)!!!!"
3,"should be called ""short shot""","Great toy for looks and is cool to take apart the components and reconfigure, but ""long shot"" - not really. The darts might go 15 feet at most. Still fun, but not if your child is looking for much performance from it."
5,Perfect Fit,"Works just like I expected with the dioptric adjustment lens (Canon Dioptric Adjustment Lens E (-2) for EOS 1D, 10D, 20D, D30, D60, Digital Rebel & 1v SLR Cameras) on my 40D. It sticks out a tiny bit more than the frame that comes with the camera, which actually seems to help cut down on the nose sweat that ends up on the LCD (ew?)."
3,it's okay,"It is a bit too wordy, but good overall coverage. I do not want to get too wordy here either"
3,Fine line..Needs better pen width for grip or rubber sleeve.,"See above. Nice thin line. Pen just a bit skinny and not easy to grip. Personally I'm a small person and if i think this, can imagine reg size person would feel strongly..needs rubber dots on grip & graduate to wider for girp area."
2,pens,not really what I was expecting. It writes great but has the feel of a pen that you get at a grand opening
3,It's Okay,Good pen that can be presented to friends. The pen tip is good enough and fine for writing. Very smooth and glides very well.
5,John Beckett walks the walk,"Mastering Monday is another window into the amazingly well-integrated life of its author, John Beckett. Combining personal experiences from the workplace with colorful examples from the lives of his biblical heroes, John has again inspired and challenged readers to move beyond the artificial boxes of ""religious"" and ""secular"" to allowing the Lordship of Jesus to impact, rearrange and pervade all aspects of our lives, including our Monday workplace. Thanks, John, for rescuing the concept of ""work"" from the dumpster of our society and restoring the God-given honor and dignity it deserves.Garth V. Hunt, Campbellville, ON, Canada"
1,Not really how it was,"Having worked for Mac Tools and John Aden, I was amazed at how inaccurate Mr. Aden was in his chapter. Mr. Beckett should have done his research on Mr. Aden's true colors."
3,Okay for vomit,"This fake vomit is okay. Doesn't look good enough to fool parents, but still fun to play with. It would be better if it looked like the picture."
1,Too Fake,"My six-year-old really didn't get the rise that I promised him ... rather disappointing! Didn't look like vomit, more of a beer-spill."
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered this online and got something that looked completely different. The product I did receive was a bit disappointment. It does not look like vomit at all, I wouldn't recommend buying this one."
3,Delighful music with folk themes,"I first hear Tulindberg's violin concerto and traced it to this Classical Age in Finland recording. The selections, infused with folk themes, are delightful! Recently I also became enamored with Rautavaara, another Finish composer. Cantus Arcticus is one of his compositions, which incorporates arctic bird sounds into orchestral music producing very ""other worldly"" sounds. Wonderful listening!"
2,Colorful temporary tattoos,"This Dover Little Book contains eleven pictures of gargoyles. They're all quite colorful, and some of them appeal, but none of them seem especially interesting. My cousins (ages six and seven, female) passed it back and forth for a couple of weeks, and I don't know that they ever did use them all. The designs seem too ugly for girls (I know, they're gargoyles, they're supposed to be ugly, but there are limits) and perhaps are too colorful for boys, but that's only a guess. ... I don't know that I would say don't buy it, but I probably wouldn't put it at the top of the list, either."
4,I'm back to my first love... LaVoz,"I used LaVoz reeds in high school and college, but after college, I stopped playing for 15 years. I was reminded about LaVoz while surfing the internet, and decided that I needed to go back to the reeds that I used to be so happy with. I am happy that I did!"
3,previous reviewer got it wrong,"The previous reviewer appears to have watched Peter Brook's version of the Mahabharata, which was an excellent, multinational production - theatrical, epic, spare, poetic, rendered in quiet, nearly monochromatic hues and with often silent backgrounds, interspersed with periods of hauntingly beautiful music. This is totally unlike the Chopra & Chopra directed Hindi version.If your American or European, stick with Peter Brook's version first (now available on DVD), then try the other versions -- or read William Buck's translation/rendition."
2,Caution! Product title is misleading,"These are fine pens but this SKU is for singles, NOT boxes of twelve as the product title suggests. Don't inadvertently pay $8 for a single pen!"
5,I like those pens,Sanford(R) Uni-Ball(R) Deluxe Rollerball Pens are good. It is easy to write and to draw with them.
1,Amazon Screwed Up the Order!!!!,"Amazon sent the wrong item, not what I ordered. Now I have to waste time I don't have trying to get it returned.!!!!!Paul"
2,Boring,"I don't like to give so few stars to someone else's effort, but I found this DVD boring to the tilt.Mostly a woman's face (maybe the author?) telling and/or reading to us of all kinds of ""funny"" things to insert in a script: Funny names, funny existing places, funny wardrobes, funny situations, and so on. When the woman's face is not on the screen, we see uninteresting shots of babies or people in ridiculous dresses. WOW!I am giving more than one star as someone else may find the above very original for a funny script."
2,Not as neat as I thought it would be...,"This flashlight is a novel idea, but the write up on it was a little misleading. When I purchased it, I thought you would be able to project messages with the flashlight part of it. Instead you have to shake the flashlight back and forth to see the message appear and it is very hard to see and not real easy to format the messages. My son loves the blue flaslight, so it wasn't a complete waste, but I wish the message part was better."
4,this is so cool,"well, i only have one word to say......cool.this super gadget is awesome for spying and is a must have, i love it and i am an awesome spy, i can give you tips, but if xmas is coming up, or your b-day, you must get this, it is awesome for the dark and everything elsetake my word for itwritten by:the best spy kid in the world"
2,Rusty surprise,I ordered this particular shower caddy because of its stainless steel construction figuring it would not rust and would be virtually maintenance free. The shiny appearance of the new caddy diminished quickly as it began to show rust within two months. The rust spots are easily removed with a scotchbrite pad but reappear regularly.
1,"if it's stainless steel, why is it rusty?",This must have been manufactured in a country where the definition of 'stainless steel' is different than in American English. Got rusty in about the same amount of time as a chrome-plated or rubber-coated model. It's no wonder it's no longer available; hope they got enough complaints to discontinue its manufacture.
3,About what I expected,"What I was in need of was a shower caddy made of stainless steel and this item filled that need. Can't say a whole lot for the design - just not upscale, but the only one I could find."
4,"very attractive, wish we had purchased some of the larger size too.",Product was easy to assemble and very attractive. We have eight of the torches around our pool area and they add nicely to the atmosphere. I do wish we had ordered some of the larger size too.
5,SAT delivers,"This book was just what I was looking for to help my son improve his essay skills. It's an easy read, makes sense and easy to put into practice. Worth the money."
5,Review on SAT Essay Book,"I bought this book about a week before i took the SAT. It was enjoyable, with some puns and jokes, so not completely boring. It did have some good, easy tips for improving your essay. I guess you have to be real enthusiastic on improving your score to really remember them all because I for sure wasn't."
1,No help at all,"I didn't read the reviews about this book and thought a 4 and 1/2 stars is a good enough for me to give it a try. To my surprise, when I finished the book, it didn't give me any strong idea how to write a good essay. Lots of quotes were taken from famous writers, but these are just rubbish, it won't help me to improve my writing and scores. If what other 1 star reviews said is true, they should be ashamed to put the same reviews in all online store to get higher review points."
5,the best sat help out there,"I decided to get this book which I saw at a store and it was a lot smaller, and easier too read than most other SAT books. When I got my score back, it was 30 points under perfect. This is the best SAT help out there, and I reccomend it 100 percent. This book is exceptional."
1,FAIL.,"I was impressed by the customer reviews until I saw the 1-star review. Just for fun, i looked this book up on barnes and nobles and it turns out that there's the SAME EXACT review on their site as the 5-star review that shows up first on amazon. PLUS theyre all from California...and they all review this book series. They probably asked all their loser freinds to give them good rating. How lame. Now i really wont buy this book, even if it's actually good."
1,An excellent glue,"But, the subcontractor to Amazon, Deerso Company, never sent the correct product.They sent E9416 instead of P9416 which is the Ultimate High Performance glue from Elmer's."
3,Heavy romance,"Bodice ripper. It's not a light read.Kings, politics, & drama that dragged a bit :- Little humor.- Lack of depth to the relationship.- Revolved around regaining her estate (got tedious).- Needed more emphasis on the hero.+ Great male characters+ Really bad 'bad guy' had me boiling over.+ Exciting.+ Sexy"
2,A weak entry in the field of romance...,"Bertrice Small, normally an EXCELLENT writer, has created a novel that, while set in an interesting time period, eventually falls pretty flat. Arabella Grey isn't as meaty as Small's previous characters, and her reasons for doing what she does seem artificial. I simply could not warm up to this character, which for me is RARE in a Small novel. The heroine's mother in particular annoyed me.Stick to Small's Renaissance features (the O'Malley saga, the Leslie saga). MUCH more entertaining...."
3,Not a likeable heroine (or hero for that matter),"She abandons her child and the man she loves for her run down, practically abandoned family home. She cheats on him with his nephew and others. He feels guilty for not getting her family home back for her sooner and forcing her to ""sell"" herself to get it back. Please! your choices; A: rich gorgeous, titled husband & infant daughter or B: small, barely profitable keep & lands. The choice would be clear to me. But not our heroine."
3,Not like the other Ms. Small books,"I was really liking the first half of the book, and I can even see why the girl would make some of the choices she does. She could see that the people she felt responsible for were dying, but this heroine isn't as cool as Bertrice Small's other heroines. However, it is a Bertrice Small book and in some ways is better than others of the genre because it does blend the history and the romance. And at least it has a happy ending."
3,I have read better Beatrice!!,"I have read better Beatrice, I would have liked for the male lead to not be so wishy washy. I like strong female characters. and Arabella was, but I also like ones that can see their faults and try to correct them. This was two stubborn individuals that con not admit they were wrong in any form. So it was an ok read, but Beatrice has done much better work for my taste."
5,"Yippee, they don't fit a Goth stereotype!","As the summary states, this band has won my approval because they are the epitome of what Goth is supposed to be: beauty laced with melancholia. Unfortunately, the press seems to label any band who sounds even slightly, what's the word, ""dark"" as Goth. Don't they understand that it takes more than a little eyeliner and songs about Satan to make you Goth? Goth is not about that at all. With this brilliant CD, The Shroud proves that adequately. They bring Goth back to what is was intended to be all along: a release for romanticism and the inevitable tragedy that follows. *mindless ramblings from the strangely complacent girl in the velvet stockings...but you can just call me Dementia*"
4,A superior album.,"""A Dark Moon Night"" is a surprisingly good album in any context. The songs are full of subdued hooks that are immediately catchy while maintaining the ethereal quality for which The Shroud and Gothic style bands like them are known for. Lydia Fortner's graceful vocals are the perfect accompaniment to the haunting melodies that beg the question ""why don't more people know about The Shroud?"" If you're looking for the band that walks the tightrope between too catchy and too morose here it is."
2,anticipation leads to letdowns.,"After hearing ""Pixy-Led"" on one of those cheesy goth compilation cds, I thought that The Shroud would be an amazing band. Pixy-Led certainly is a catchy, semi-powerful song. But maybe it was only good in the context of ""we are so goth and bleak"" bands on the compilation. Maybe I was just looking for some salvagable song so that I could say the compilation wasn't a complete waste of money. After hearing ""A Dark Moon Night,"" I have decided a few things. The Shroud DOES have potential. However, everything seemed to blend together and sound the same as everything else. Once again, I'm finding that ""Pixy-Led"" is the only salvagable song on a cd full of filler. And that upsets me, because I was so looking forward to hearing the Shroud. I really thought that they'd be an amazing band.Don't get me wrong, they're not terrible. They're just not as good as I expected them to be..."
5,"Burton fan or not, this is fantastic","Funny, clever, original, charming, sweet, cynical, endearing, intriguing, fascinating, and purely wonderful. There are little poema and random thoughts with wonderfully charming illustrationsThis book fits every mood and, like his films, it transports you into another world and that is what reading is all about."
4,Tim Burton impresses,"Interesting poetry. It's mother goose with a twist for adults. Like most of his films, this book has many unrealistic characters with realistic struggles which made me think a lot."
4,Melancholy Indeed!,"Tim Burton is pure genius. In this little book of melancholy poetry he combines humor, darkness and independent thought into indescribable delight.This petite book of 23 short poems is the definition of creativity and artistic expression. Burton's poetry is simple, rhythmical and completely unique. His characters are as varied as ""James"" to ""The Boy With Nails in His Eyes,"" each offering a touch of whimsy beside an outsider existence. Anyone who has ever felt different will somehow relate! Complete with Burton's own drawings of each distinctive character it is a very entertaining experience.If you enjoy Tim Burton's films and relate to his ability to tell the tale of misshapen outcasts you will enjoy this chance to savor Burton in print. Adults and children alike can chuckle and moan at the inventiveness of a true original."
2,Meh,"This is basically Tim Burton's attempt to mimic Shel Silverstein, only with much darker overtones and without any -- literally any -- of Silverstein's insight."
4,"Interesting, quirky, odd","This is an interesting read mostly. Take it out of your library and give it a spin. It's doubtful you will want to purchase such a book unless you are a diehard Tim Burton nut. The poetry can be elegant at times, and bizarre, not to mention all too brief. Cute book. Makes you think."
4,Twisted and Delicious,"I read this all in one sitting and thought it was a wonderful, twisted blast of sardonic fun. I've always appreciated Burton's odd and dark sense of humor, so I felt perfectly at home within the pages of this little book. It's a bit pricey for the length, but I got over it.However, unless your kids are as weird as I was as a kid, I probably wouldn't make it bed-time fare for the young'uns. If you're a fan of calming hysterical children freaked out by dreams about the boy with nails in his eyes, then by all means..."
3,tis good...,"I found this book funny as hellsinki! tim Burton did a number on the dark humor side of things with these short poems. There where however some problems...One i read through it in 10 mins..i didn't like the fact that i spent so much money on a lil book that i finished quicker than a carebears book. Two it was sorta dull if your looking for sinical sarcastic silly short poems than i would recomend the book called ""Creepy Susie: And Thirteen Other Tragic Tales for Troubled Children"" it is more funny than dark but it is definately in the shadows."
2,damaged.,"when i first it, title sticker was coming off, was scratched, couple bent pages. all in all good read but pretty bad condition."
5,I LIKE IT!,Very cute. I am more for the darker reads and this one did not disappoint. very cute indeed. would suggest.
2,still have not received,"I ordered this book over a month ago. Well before the hurricane and still have not received the order. It was a very low price. I have owned the book before. I thought it was funny and cute, not able to find it from storage I re purchased it. I give the book itself five stars. I can only give the purchase two stars because I have not received the book or any information reguarding it from the seller except the email of purchase."
4,A great gift for Burton Fans,"The book is a bit over-priced for it's small content, but where else are you going to get original drawings and poems from the mind who brought you PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, BEETLEJUICE, BATMAN, SLEEPY HOLLOW and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS? Burton's short, simple poems and illustrations are reminiscent of Edward Gorey and will appeal to those with a grim, dark and offbeat sense of humor. If this is not you then you will probably not like ...OYSTER BOY. The stories seem simple and silly (and don't get me wrong, they are) but they're also about isolation and being different from everyone around you (a trait all of Burton's film characters share)....OYSTER BOY is a great little book that any fan would be happy to have, especially if you love seeing Burton's unique illustrative style."
3,Not quite Gorey,"Although I love the irreverent films of Tim Burton, his new book seems a little too contrived, practicly mimicking the classic Edward Gorey style of The GashlyCrumbTinies. The illustrations are definitely worth the twenty bucks. I'm going to stick to his movies from now on though."
3,Cute for Gothic Kids.,"Very well edited and it has some cute poems but it's not very funny and not very smart. It's bizarre, in an inofensive way. Just cute, for gothic kids."
1,Save Your Money,"I like Tim Burton's movies, and I saw the drawing of the Oyster Boy in an ad for this book in the New Yorker, and naively assumed all the drawings would be like that, but they are not. The artwork is ugly, and the sentiments are worse: a father eats his oyster-son to enhance his sex life. It's not for children or me either."
4,"a fun little book, but NOT for children","This is a fun little book, full of simple illustrations and dark little stories. Please be aware that it is NOT a book for children, as the themes may be way too scary. If you are a fan though of Tim Burton's twisted humor, you would probably enjoy it."
5,Dark and funny.,"There isn't a whole lot to not like about this book. While it is short, sometimes brevity is key to good storytelling. Tim Burton's little comic strip style book perfectly captures readers with it's dark wit and laughable illustrations. While this is and never could be considered good literature by any stretch of the imagination, it is never-the-less an entertaining read with a cast of colorless characters (most of the illustrations are in black in white) that will make you laugh out loud. Any fan of Tim Burton or dark humor will enjoy this quick read!"
5,Just Burton,"Burton is just a genius, but the question i asked as i write this is, what kind o genius? The answer that appears in my mid, is simple and clear. Burton is a REAL Genius, his brillant imagination, his childish poems, his fellings and the way he feels about the world. Maybe i write more that i was planning to. What i said is, just buy it, it's fresh, funny, cruel but not in the bad way. It's JUST amazing."
3,A book of NOT SO CURIOUS curiosities,"Frankly, I didn't find this book to be very creative or interesting. Many of the vignettes are much too short to evoke any humor or feelings. The author seems to have glanced at his surroundings and made a boy or girl character out of things ranging from stains to matches and then proceeded to make up obvious stories about them. (Surprise, surprise, the match girl was ""hot"" and burned up her stick lover.) The three stars is for the illustrations and the melancholy concept."
4,"Great, though twisted, yet cute at the same time",It was wonderful! Twisted little poems with gorey-like illustrations. Typical Tim Burton.
5,Awesome!,"Wonderful! It got here on time, and my sister was speechless! She loved it, and read it in about a day.Very, very happy!"
4,"Poor, poor Oyster Boy!",Tim Burton takes you on a wild ride in this collection of twisted and funny stories and poetry. This is definitely a unique twist on fairy tales.
2,Pretty bad,"This was the final Mahavishnu album of the 70s, and quite different from the group's earlier work. Four songs are essentially cheesy, light r&b;/funk with vocals. Some of the instrumental tracks are also more commercial than the challenging material of earlier albums.The album's strongest tracks are ""All in the Family"", ""Lotus Feet"" and ""Inner Worlds"". McLaughlin does some early experimentation with a guitar synthesizer. ""All in the Family"" features some intense playing over an churning African-Latin beat; ""Lotus Feet"" would be given better performances by various incarnations of McLaughlin's other band, Shakti; and ""Inner Worlds"" almost sounds like an early precursor of techno.This album is only recommended for McLaughlin completists. Otherwise stick to Mahavishnu's earlier albums.[This review is based on the domestic reissue of the early 90s. The tracklist is identical]"
2,Everyone is allowed a mistake,"When I like a band I try and be a little bit of a completest, and I love the early Mahavishnu Orchestra. I am only glad that this was not the first recording I heard from this band, or I would have missed some great music. Mere jazz/funk, almost too formulaic. Why do modern jazz lyrics have to be so cringeworthy? John McLaughlin went on to redeem himself with Shakti. If you want to know what all the fuss was about, start anywhere but here."
3,"Instrumentals=Good, Vocals=Bad","The instrumentals on this album are of pretty nice quality, and I must admit John McLaughlin is a great guitar player, but in my opinion there are better albums involving John McLaughlin. Also the songs with vocals on this album don't sound that good at all, mainly because the vocals are mostly bad. Definantly do not spend the import price for this album, unless you're a huge McLaughlin fan."
1,embarrassing,The irony is that so few of these attempts at crass commercialism actually sell well. I'd just like to forget this record ever happened.
2,The Weakest Mahavishnu Album,"Recorded long after the breakup of the original group, this recording finds McLaughlin at something of a loss. The bold new directions established by the original band's recordings (Inner mounting flame, Birds of Fire) seem to have led into a dead end. (McLaughlin abandoned the fusion approach not long after Inner Worlds was issued.)Most of this album is standard issue 70s funk/jazz that is unmemorable at best (and annoying at times, with a vocal that chants insistently: ""are you ready to be ... a planetary citizen""?)I bought this CD because of ""Lotus Feet"", the one gem on this otherwise lackluster set. It's worth it for that, but discs like this one are what CD burners were invented for.My apologies to my old friend Stu Goldberg, who plays the keyboards on this album."
2,avoid,if youre a mclaughlin freak avoid this at all costs. it is very indicative of pending atrocities like 'mahavishnu' and 'adventures in radioland'. how he went from the brilliance of 'visions of the emerald beyond' to this is a mystery.
2,Pretty bad,"This was the final Mahavishnu album of the 70s, and quite different from the group's earlier work. Four songs are essentially cheesy, light r&b;/funk with vocals.

Otherwise stick to Mahavishnu's earlier albums."
1,Avoid this stinker - better albums by McLaughlin abound,"I am a big fan of McLaughlin, but this is a 'direct to the bargain bin' release. For acoustic stuff, check out Shakti. For electric stuff, the original Mahavishnu Orchestra (Cobham, Hammer etc) is unequaled. For a dose of something in-between, check out the album where Trilok Gurtu plays percussion."
2,TECHNOLOGY GONE MAD!,"This is a big let down. You'd think that he was trying to put as much difference between say, 'birds of fire' and this as he could. The album is only partially saved by Narada Michael Walden's top drumming (another musician that has really lost his way!)and his song 'way of the pilgrim'. The rest is rather uninspired noodlings, meandering and pointless. If i want to hear a synthesiser i'll buy a Tomita record (God forbid) if i want guitar i expected Mahavisuna to deliver the goods. But a guitar that sounds like a synthesiser?..i mean what's the point. It's just pointless. Stick with the other Mahavisuna albums or his solo album 'electric guitar' Big let down!"
5,Excellent Pens!,uni-ball Vision pens are the best all around pens that I have found. They hold up well and I would buy them again.
2,These are NOT micro,"The Uni-ball vision pens are among the best: But just to be clear, these are NOT micro. They are fine.So, this quality product received a two-star rating based on incorrect labeling."
3,Seer Sees,The book is a comprehensive overview of the book of Daniel. The author writes in a style that both captivates and makes you want to get more information about specific topics. It is a good read for the curious mind.
1,DO NOT BUY!,I installed 3 of these...two of them began acting up (dangerously) within a few weeks and I had to stop using them. The other has never read them temperature correctly but otherwise worked for a couple years...before failing.
3,"Nice Watch, But...","Well, this thing is huge!! Unless you are a diving fanatic and don't care about fashion, this watch is definitely not for you. It is so heavy you can almost use to work your arm.It probably a very nice watch, but not for me."
4,"Nice for star gazing when sleeping, summer tent","This tent has been used three times, worked well. we did not put the roof on and fell asleep to the starts. We heard thunder and we put the roof on, it rained hard but we stayed dry inside. We paid 100 $ for it, it is worth it."
5,A Horse Lovers Must,"This book is very detailed with diseases, illnesses, cut, fractures, snake bites and more. I like to take care of my horse when I can and not take her to the vet except after she foals. I like to give the shots and do what I can. This book is very detailed and very helpful."
2,the complete equine veterinary manual,"the pictures in the book are great but how the book is set up is overall not easy to find diagnoses for problems, i would not buy this book if had saw it before hand"
4,Interesing take on Homer and archaic Greece,"For those of you who are just interested in a good story, ""The Hostage"" is indeed a good and fairly quickly paced story. It centers around the life of a young wealthy man named Philocleon who in the course of a few months meets, befriends, and kills Homer and his own father, loses his family estate, loses his eyesight, frees his slaves and finds love matches for those who help him, as well as make sure the words of one of Homer's poems, The Illiad, are written down and dedicated to Apollo. The ending is quite aburpt actually and leaves many questions and Philocleon's own marriage hanging. I took this as fictiion and yet as an ancient historian somes things were a bit odd. Why this one poem and how would others then be acredited to Homer? Why were the writing tutors Assyrian when it is Phoenician that Greek develops from?"
1,Misleading,"I only received one package of 10, not six as stated. When writing to complain, I was told I received what I was suppose to receive and would not be receiving the remaining 5 boxes. They are, however, crediting my credit card for my inconvenience and are going to send my complaint to the appropriate department to be fixed. I don't think anyone will pay $16.49 for 10 wipes, I surely would not have."
3,Buy the Uniball Deluxe instead...,"The folks who rave about this pen as being ""the best,"" etc. must be unaware of the fact that Uniball makes a ""Deluxe"" version of this pen which has a slightly larger diameter (for a substantially better grip) and much sharper styling. I have several examples of both pens and the ""Deluxe is the way to go. I don't know if Amazon sells the ""Deluxe"" models, but Uniball does make them and they are readily available for those who look."
3,Another outing for Cecily,"OK, I didn't enjoy this book as much as earlier entries in the Pennyfoot Hotel series, but maybe I've just moved in a different direction in the meantime. The book opens as Cecily and hubby Baxter are at the breakfast table discussing a just-delivered letter; their multi-syllabic conversation seemed stilted and Baxter sounded like a pompous jerk.Things picked up a bit after that scene. And to give Kingsbury her due, the dialogue provided is more believable for the period than if the two had been sitting there chatting in 21st Century American (or Brit) vernacular!Although I didn't love this book, I don't think the more savage of the reviews posted here are warranted. I like Kingsbury's books overall, they are usually a good escapist read - rollicking good tales and some fun characters along the way."
5,Kate Kingsbury books,I have read all her books that are in ebook format and love them. I especially enjoy stories in that era and her characters are charming. Just one complaint. When are they ALL going to be in ebook format please. I travel a lot so need to have them on my ereader.
2,Disappointing,"This is awful. The characters are shallow cliches and full of contradictions. For instance, we're constantly reminded about the happy marriage of the protagonists, the Baxters, yet they seem constantly to be lying and arguing. The historical detail is full of anachronisms, very sloppily researched. The plot is transparent and contrived. There's a grammatical error of some sort every couple of pages. I bought the book because of the Christmas setting, but there's very little holiday atmosphere or detail. I see that this author has a number of other books in print; that may account for the formulaic quality of this one. I hope the others are better; I won't be reading any of them."
1,Quite Dreadful-No Stars however I had to choose 1-5,"I was terribly disappointed in this mystery. I had enjoyed Kingbury's Manor House mysteries, and so looked forward to this era, setting in a resort on the seacoast in England and the time of year. The characters are shallow, one-dimensional, the main character is a nosey-parker, with nothing to do but fawn over servants and come to conclusions that the author doesn't let the reader in on.There's no Christmas presence in this book, and lots of bickering between the main character and her husband.Early in the book, she describes the barrister club, and informs us that King George VI was a member--this a novel of Edwardian England! I'm an Anglophile albeit an American but I picked up on this error and tut tut to the editors at Penguin who did not. Terribly disppointing-I'll leave the other mysteries by this author at the bookshop."
5,Excellent Latin program,Latina Christiana dvd's are an excellent teaching tool. The teacher explains the lessons very well and the lessons aren't too long. Children can easily follow it and learn. The workbook exercises are a repeat of the lesson which reinforces what was learned from the dvd. I would recommend this especially for anyone who never took a language before.
3,Not for Us....,"I learned of this product from The Well Trained Mind and was so excited to get it. I was disappointed in it from the get go and ended up returning it.Every other day when I would pull out the book and CD, my kids would get discouraged. To me the lessons seemed discombobulated. And I also thought it leaned a little too heavy on prayers. I am Christian but don't want my kids spending time memorizing Latin prayers. They really did not enjoy the lesson material or the voice on the CD.As a parent, I felt like the lessons weren't very well laid out. It was all very confusing.We are now using the English from the Roots Up flashcards. While my kids won't be able to read Latin documents, they will know Latin and Greek roots to help with their SATs and ACTs and that is what I am concerned about. Also - now I can focus on teaching them a foreign language they can use daily."
1,TOO SMALL in relation to other kitchen items,"This item is REALLY small. I didn't read the other reviews and missed the info on the actual size of the item. In hindsight, I wouldn't have order it had I paid more attention. I think the other products from Haba (eggs and teabags) are worth the money for the size."
2,not as pictured,"I received my order today, and discovered (as with all of the Hasa products in my order) that although more than one item is pictured-- only one comes with the order. The item itself is very small, 2 1/2"" X 1"". That, fine, I can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood, lifesize would make play a work-out for most children. However, shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for ONE item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising."
2,Miniscule,"I have the tea bags, which are small but very cute and fit nicely into my childrens' tea cups. I bought the cookies for them to have with their tea, also tiny but cute and the kids love them. Thought a little milk would be nice to have to go with the tea theme... The milk carton is just too funny though. As small as their food stuff is, this is miniscule, extremely small. Too small really. They could have made them a bit bigger. It doesn't make a lot of sense to have a milk carton that is practically as big as a tea bag. These are just silly."
3,A Bit Too Small..,"My children have enjoyed this purchase of the milk carton, and pouring us ""milk"" in their play kitchen, however, the actual size is a bit too small. Be sure to read the description thoroughly prior to purchase. With this purchase, you receive one (1) milk carton (as the photo can be misleading), and the carton is only about 2"" in size. I wish I would have paid more attention to the description because it is just a bit too small. It takes away from the realism."
2,Cute but not worth it,"BE SURE TO READ THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION!!! The picture is misleading showing two cartons and item name is ""Milk Cartons"" (plural) giving the impression that there are two but the product description is accurate. I really should have taken out a ruler, though, to realize just how small it really was. Shipping was more than the cost of the item and would have returned except I'd be responsible for that cost, too so I'm writing off as lesson learned going forward. May end up more of a dog toy as it really is too small to use in a play kitchen and too large for typical doll house. Quality did seem good, though."
1,Ridiculous waste of money!,"Ridiculous waste of money! Too small for a toddler to use safely. Just a tiny, cheap piece of painted wood. You only get one item instead of 2 pictured. Don't buy!!"
4,"Small, but works for us","My daughter (2Om) got this milk carton from grandma for xmas along with a bunch of other mini fruits and veggies. We gave her the Educo kitchen, which has a small footprint for a small playroom. She LOVES the mini food including the milk carton, and they go great with a small kitchen. She doesn't care at all that it's out of proportion (they all are out of proportion), but she knows that it's milk and she's happy to pretend to pour it just the same. Choking hazard not withstanding, all of the mini groceries have a really nice feel - the wood is smooth and the paint is nice. Very tactile for little hands.It's definitely small, but does ""work"" for pretend play."
1,I got 16 of these?,"I'm really confused, first of all, these milk cartons are as small as the palm of my hand; and I got SIXTEEN of them? What am I going to do with 16 of them? Returning, I thought this would be good for my son's kitchen. They are more like blocks, but since they are unstackable, I don't know what to do with them."
1,Very Poor!!,"This product is not as it is presented. I thought the size would be larger and it would be for two of the milk cartons. It is only 2 1/2 inches tall and we only received one milk carton. I bought it for my grandchild to play with pretend food. The pretend food is larger than this milk carton. THIS ITEM IS A REAL JOKE....and the laugh is on stupid people like me who bought it! I would return it, but would spend more in return postage & my time than it is worth. EXTREMELY disappointed!!!! I would have given it only a 1/10th of a star point rating, but the system would not allow me to rate less than one star!"
1,Disappointing toy,I am sending this toy back over priced and visual is deceiving. I honestly thought that the product was bigger and that i would be getting two of them as a teacher for 38 years I say disappointment!
1,Miniature milk cartons for a doll.,These two small cartons of milk are very deceiving in size online. They are way too small for a child to pretend to pour milk from them. Please improve on this one item. Also in my order I received only one carton and it showed two in the picture.
2,Play food,The milk container is so small we refer to it as the creamer. We purchased another milk container that is more life size and this is the creamer when she makes her pretend coffee. It often get's lost in the play food basket because it is so small. Would be nice if it were a few inches taller and wider.
3,Very tiny!,"This milk carton is much smaller than I expected, I was thinking it would work as a play food item for my 3yo's play kitchen. However this is 1/4 the size of any other play food item, it looks as though it belongs in a doll house rather than playfood."
1,SIZE MATTERS,"This milk carton is way too small. But, I guess it is my fault for not reading the dimensions or other customer reviews. It is very cute and if it wasn't so inexpensive I would definitely be returning it, but for the price it just isn't worth the hassel of getting a refund. Bummer. I was really excited to give this to my daughter along with her Melissa and Doug kitchen & kitchen items for Christmas. I guess you live and learn!"
2,A shot of milk anyone?,When I opened the box I thought it was empty and then I see this small little carton of milk. I guess I thought it was bigger to small for play kitchen and not worth sending back I am sure it will just end up in the bottom of toy box. I also did not read the reviews so next time I will on all orders.
2,INACCURATE description,"The product description is INCOMPLETE/INACCURATE! There was a button that asked for more info so I pointed out that the original description did not tell how fine the point was. The smart Alec review kept popping up 'fine point' in numerous earlier reviews.My old pens are 0.3 mm . . . and the new ones are 0.7 mm. Sorry, in my book more than twice as big is not the same. I will shop around more next time - and see if I can't get a clearer, more honest review.No complaints about Amazon's delivery: the package was here the day after it was ordered!"
5,An excellent handbook on the subject,"Sometimes it is very difficult to teach a course in quantum mechanics because there are few problems that have solutions that do not require months of research and numerical methods to solve. I have found that in my own courses on quantum mechanics, I take a lot of notes and I do a lot of homework assignments, but I don't have a whole lot of concrete, well-explained problems and solutions to show for all of the work. Since I found this book and those that accompany it, however, I have a very good source for problems and their solutions in QM. These problems are an excellent study aid for the solutions provide insight into the basics of the field. Strongly recommended."
3,"A good collection of problems, but lacking in other respects","I'm using this book to study for my Ph.D. qualifying exams, and while it's great to have such a large number of problems to practice with, I'm consistently disappointed in the editing of the book--it is riddled with typographical errors. I'm willing to forgive a few typos, but not those that interfere with understanding content, as they sometimes do in this book. Also, the solutions provided are hit-and-miss; most are decent, but some are terse, obscure, or self-contradictory."
4,revista,I'm glad to pursache this book of problems of quantum mechanics because it is a great variety of them from varios universitys. Thank you.
3,The Editor Needs Glasses,"I study physics in Chile, and this book has been pretty useful for a first course in QM, but I have to note that the first 170 pages are titled ""Problems and Solutions on Electromagnetism""! I hope someone gets word to the editor....Other than that, I'm pretty sure this book will find a place on your private shelf."
5,Assume Your Queen Power,"Hold on to your tiaras, Allyn Mitchell Evans takes you on quite a ride in her new book, ""Grab the Queen Power: Live Your Best Life!"". Charming, clever and oh, so moving, ""Queen Power"" is a delightful excursion into the feminine psyche. Socialized to expect second best from childhood, women accept their roles as perpetual cheerleaders rather than push for what they really want - to be a star in their own right.Ms. Allyn tells you how. From ""Stop the Mean Voice"" to ""Queens Focus"", her approach is positive and self managed.When at last, I finished this book and set it on the shelf, I felt good. I smiled at myself in the mirror and touched up my lipstick before picking up my scepter and going out to ascend my throne in the town square."
5,Empowers Readers Through Experiences,"This book is a wonderful example of how we get locked into stereotypes and what to do when we don't fit these stereotypes. Evans encourages independence and self-reliance through her words, examples, and experiences of others. Through her writing, I too have grabbed my own queen power."
3,Look around first!,I have just received my Ulu after hearing my neighbors rave about theirs. While the price here seems good ($29.95) I was unpleasantly surprised to get charged an additional $11 for shipping and handling. The item appears to be of average quality with only minimal sanding on the bowl.
3,"midnight dub,, yay","well my daugther has an xbox 360 so this game was useless, couldn't play it on her 360 system, i know this is a good gamewe enjoyed it on playstation 2 in the past, it just was a bad choice here on my part."
1,"if it don't work why send it ,cheap people out for a dollar,,,so keep the dollar.","white mountain traders/really bad they didn't check the to see if it worked. Big wast of time dealing with these people. the product is ok i got to see very little but it was cool what i did get to see ,,,,the vid was scratched up to the max and played some then stuck so what a bummer picked the wrong company ,,well sorry wish I had a better thing to say."
3,"not quite, but good","Due to all the reviews, I got this one. Bottom line is that it does not stack up to NFS, if you are a fan of that series. The thing I love about NFS is that you can get your car to an almost unbeatable state. I like to win so that is great with me. DUB is more difficult due to the broad spectrum of cars/events to choose from. I DO like DUB but the game but if you do not want to attempt a race 50 times in order to win, this ain't the one for you."
5,THIS GAME GOT BLINGAGE,"This game is awesome! You can trick out anything you can get your hands on, choppers, street bikes, muscle cars, exotics, even trucks and SUV's. The races are fun and challenging, and it makes you feel like your really their racing in the driver's seat. It's much better than NFSU2 and any other racing game out there."
4,good but not great,"this is a nice racer. however, once you play burnout revenge there is no comparison. burnout's speed and adrenaline factor just blows midnight club away.if you can get midnight club used then it's probably a good buy.it ain't great in my book though - just good."
5,Midnight Club 3: DUB EDITION,"MY SON RENTED THIS GAME AND ABSOLUETLY LOVED IT, AND WAS NOT HAPPY WHEN HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK. SO LIKE EVERY CRAZY PARENT GOT A GREAT DEAL ON AMAZON.COM TREATED MY SON, MY DAUGHTER, AND HER BOYFRIEND TO MORE FUNFILLED FREE TIME."
3,Not my bag.,Fits nice and snug. The bottom part stays attached to the camera while you can remove the whole front cover. It takes away from the feel of the Canon IX Lite and adds a little weight. The bottom snap seems to rub against the bottom of the lens when removing the front of the case. It's hard to turn the program dial as well because the attached bottom is so close to it. Try it. You can always return it.
5,I quite enjoyed it,"I look for books on this subject, and have to say I enjoyed this one. Ther style is a bit different from what I expected, and the story is certainly not what I expected - which ads a new dimention to the Berlin fight. It wasn't always constant bitter fighting with tanks everywhere. There was a lot of confusion, and a lot of time when not mnuch was going on.The one weak point is in the maps, which could be improved, but they do help tie the story into the historical tale- and the fellow that helped edit in in English is known as a long time student of the Berlin fight, so if he says its real, I belive him.So all in all I recomend it for those looking for a groiund eye view of the fight for Berlin."
5,VERY SATISFIED,THIS BOOK WAS ALL THAT I HAD HOPED FOR; VERY EXCITING AND INFORMATIVE. I WILL PURCHASE FROM THIS DEALER IN THE FUTURE.
2,"This book should've been titled ""What's For Lunch?""","I understand he was a teenager and hungry during WWII, but almost in every page we are given his daily or even hourly menu.He remembers exactly if half or a whole pig went into the soup on day x,y or z. Seriously, at one point I stood up and made myself some food without even being hungry due to the constant reminder of food this and hunger that. Minus stars for making me break my diet."
1,Really Poor,"The guy below me pretty much said what I was about to say. Well, anyway, this book sucks. Avoid at all costs."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR CALIFORNIA NON-ABA LAW STUDENTS!,If you attend a non-ABA California law school this book and the closely related Fleming's Baby Bar Multistate Examination Workbook are a must have! All Fleming's Multistate Workbooks have detailed answers of every question that teach you every aspect of law. All California law students in non-ABA law schools remember that the California State Bar requires 4 hours a day or 864 hours per year of law study and doing the sample tests in a Fleming's Multistate Workbook helps to meet that requirement!
3,a very good book on canyon country,this is a very good book by a photographer who usually isn't very good i recomend it the book covers the big national park units in canyon country
3,"good price, but not for mac","i use macs and pcs, and this cable doesnt read on a mac for some reason. the ipod doesnt show up in itunes at all."
4,Good book on Tramp Art,"Tramp Art is a specific type of folk art made by layering notched pieces of wood in order to create ornate and multi-dimensional surfaces. Most tramp art was made in the Great Depression years from wooden cigar boxes. Helaine Fendelman was the curator of the 1975 exhibition ""Tramp Art"" at the Museum of American Folk Art. Jonathon Taylor, a professional photographer and tramp art collector, has done extensive research of the history of Tramp Art. Entertaining and beautifully illustrated, the book is noted as the ""seminal guide to Tramp Art"", and chapters include: What is Tramp Art?, Evolution of the Art, the Artists, How Tramp Art was made, the Continuing Trade, etc. At present, this is the best book on the subject of Tramp Art."
1,Bad,This was very misleading. It said package of 12 when there was only 1 in the box. I know they knew that was not 12 when they shipped that out.
1,What a joke!,"Ladies and gentlemen, the price being asked for this particular laptop is waaaaay too high for what little they're offering. Now, the 80GB HDD is not so bad, given that you can find a decent external HDD at 500GB right here on Amazon for about a hundred bucks if you shop around. Some of the graphix features are nice, but the thing that chaps my hide is the low RAM. 512 MB?! Come on, running decent programs on this laptop would be slow and probably stall, and that's on XP - there's no way I'd ever think of trying to use Vista on this machine! You're better off getting something else for the same price that has at least 2GB DDR2 RAM with 2.2GHz CPU. For this price, it should be part of the package.Shop around, and forget about this laptop! I'd say this one is worth about 300 USD, not more."
2,ELECSURF Sold Refurbished Notebook as New,"HP Pavilion DV6105US 15.4"" Widescreen Laptop (AMD Turion MK-36, 512 MB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, Super Multi Drive)I contacted HP for warranty work on this item. My purchase date from ELECSURF was 28 November 2007. HP informed me that this laptop was a refurbished item and the warrantee had run out. ELECSURF and AMAZON represented this item as new. BUYERS BEWARE!"
4,Liberation from mathematical mysteries,"This book did more to aid my understanding of modernmathematics than any graduate math course I took. Irecommend it for those that want to understand how tounderstand math.This book, plus ""Godel, Escher, Bach"" and ""Fuzzy Thinking""make will remove the confusion instilled by smallminded math teachers."
1,Does not work!!,It fits on my t1i but is really wide so it covers some buttons.It is a waste of 10 $.
3,"ok product, helps but easy to lose",it slides off of your camera (mine was attached to a canon rebel xt) too easily. easy to lose. it does help me a lot as i wear glasses. i lost mine and will now buy another as i have not found any other options
4,Nice Replacement,"This rubber eyecup for my EOS digital Rebel fit perfectly and works fine. It is not as soft as what came with the camera but this one will probably stay on the camera better, therefore not being lost. Still comfortable for my occasional use."
2,amateur photographer,"I purchased this product because I was tired of my nose being pressed against my display screen. I thought I was ordering an extension, but sadly I found out it was just an eye piece which already was on my camera. I have a Canon 50D. If you lost your eye piece, then this is what you need. If you are looking for an extension, then keep on looking. It's truly not Amazon's fault. I am new to the digital camera world and learning the myriad of linguo as I go."
3,does NOT fit 20D as advertised,3 stars since this part should not have to exist! easy to bump off while carrying your camera which is waht happened to mine...
5,El Gordo H.,Since adding the Canon Eye Cup to my XTi I can get my eye closer to the camera. It also keep me from smudging the display screen so badly. I can actually see better with this eye cup.
1,This does not fit Canon Rebel series,I purchased it with hopes that it would fit on either my Canon Rebel XT DSLR or my Rebel Xsn Film body. Instead it does not fit either. It's too big.
1,Does not fit my camera (Canon 1000D),"This is a bad buy. When you try to buy camera accesories, check if it is compatible with what you have. It does not fit to my Canon 1000D and I have no use for it."
5,Replacement part,"Fits exactly like the one I lost on one of my film cameras. OEM part I believe, so same durability and feel..."
4,Muppet's Rock,"This interesting album contains duets by Kermit and Miss Piggy with the likes of Ozzy Osbourne, Vince Gill, Don Henley (from the Eagles), and Jimmy Buffet (parrotheads take note). This recording certainly follows the precedent set by the now defunct ""Muppet Show,"" that of popular celebrities performing/interacting with the muppets. True to form this album is highly polished and sounds quite well. It has the trademark muppet humor with the funniest track, in my opinion, being that between Miss Piggy and Ozzy Osbourne. This unlikely pair really bring make this album shine with their rendition of ""Born to be Wild."" While this album will not appeal to all tastes, it could serve as a good way to introduce a younger child or non fan to rock music. If nothing else it provides yet another set rare performances by popular and diverse artists. Worth the purchase!"
3,"crazy, crazy, crazy","some of the movie is believeable and some of the movie was just plain crazy, movie just okay, but silly"
3,RIVITING BUT PAINFUL TO WATCH,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. I did not critique the actors or the directors, but I was focused on the message. The message was disturbing but typical of the life style some people may or may not choose to live. Hopelessness, addiction, violence, abuse, child neglect and exploitation, prostitution, etc. The parts that disturbed me most were the ""enema scene""--I turned my head away--and the abused and neglected children. After the movie I cried for the human race and I asked God to help us all. To help us to realize that we have the gift of a higher self that we can tap into for salvation."
4,Under Rated Film of the Year,"As the director states, ""like a car crash; you can't help but look."" Disturbing yet compassionate look at life in the inner city."
4,Life is Hot in Cracktown,"I just saw this movie at a press preview. This is a well crafted film with five star direction, editing and music and five star+ acting. Life is Hot in Cracktown is fast paced, thought provoking and satisfying. It develops its characters so that as a viewer, you actually come to care about them. There are some surprising twists and turns throughout the movie, too. I would have given the movie five stars overall, except it was a little too gritty for my entertainment tastes."
2,I wanted to love it but i could not,"I watched this thing and i can't say it is a ""bad"" movie. But , it sure is not a good movie. it's main problem is that it fell out of the Cliche tree and hit every branch on the way down.First everybody looks too good. There are good looking people in the bad parts of town but NOT EVERYONE.the cute kid leads look Like their parents wouldn't get them bad haircuts because they had a lunchables commercial shoot next.the transvestite hooker junkie love story was mildly interesting. it came the closest to having character development.the black gang members are cut outs.I did not believe the young family with the crying kid. if the wife had an extra 20 pounds it might have been more realistic. but why bother , They were cut outs too. Just building you up for a predictable ending which anyone could have seen plodding down the trail.if you are going to watch it get the unrated at least the skin is good."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money On This,"This may well have been a best selling novel. But as we all know, great books don't necessarily make for great films. Life Is Hot In Cracktown could perhaps have been something worthwhile in the right hands. But this clearly low-budget endeavor falls short of anything worth your time. The shortcomings of this film are many, but chief among them are tortoise like plot development, one dimensional characters and amateurish editing. The story isn't new. We've pretty much seen the inner-city struggles routine a hundred times by now and Cracktown brings nothing new to the table. Save your money and avoid this one."
2,Ugly and pointless,"This is one rough movie to sit through. I had to watch it over a period of a few days and it's only 95 minutes long. There is sexual assault, brutal violence and scene after scene of disgusting individuals. The only saving grace is the acting. All the characters felt real, but too bad the script didn't go anywhere. This film will leave you feeling dirty and depressed, but look on the bright side. You think your life is bad? Keep your distance from this one."
4,From The Book Of Short Stories By Buddy Giovinazzo!,"Life in ""Cracktown"" is not so hot for stars Kerry Washington, Desmond Harrington, Victor Rasuk, Shannyn Sossamon, Evan Ross, Brandon Routh, Illeana Douglas, Edoardo Ballerini, and Lara Flynn Boyle in the unflinching drug drama, ""Life Is Hot In Cracktown"". Based on the best-sellingnovelby writer-director Buddy Giovinazzo, the four stories that comprise this film are reminiscent of theAfter School Specialsyou might remember from back in the day, artfully begging the viewer's attention with an addictively watchable cast and stories. Rated R for strong violence, rape, drug content throughout, graphic sexuality, nudity, and pervasive language (as noted on the rear cover), ""Life Is Hot In Cracktown"" features Anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) video, Dolby Surround 5.1 & 2.0 English and Spanish audio, plus the following Special Features: Behind-the-scenes featurette & Deleted Scenes. Running time is 100 minutes."
3,An okay flim,"The film was okay, but not what I thought. I thought Evan Ross did a great job, although crackhead gang-bangers are a bit unrealistic; the crackhead girl they raped at the beginning was dressed just too nice to be a crackhead and other aspects were unrealistic, but an okay film. I wouldn't want to see it again, though and I waited for this film."
3,I enjoyed the grittiness. Very realistic (if you know what I mean),"This is a very gritty, urban (ghettoish) movie. There were scenes that were down right disturbing, but it happens. You may hate it, but this is why we need more social programs and parental responsibility. The violence was needed. I enjoyed it."
2,Just awful,"""Life is hot in Cracktown"" was a very disturbing film. It was a cross between watching a breaking news story and the all to tough life on the streets. I'm sure there was something about this film that may have been good; however, I'm not able to find it.. It was based on a book that I have not read and I don't think I will. I saw no redemption in this movie, it was a film that said to me there are bad people out there and watch out they will get you. You have no control over anything or anybody; furthermore there was no love story to pull it together except one scene. I turned it off and then turned it on to finish it. It is just not my kind of movie. It was violent just because these thugs could be and they left a trail of victims in their wake.There were some extras and deleted scenes. It is rated R for violence, sex and drugs. It is almost an instructional DVD on becoming a gang leader.I cannot recommend this film."
3,Interesting,"This movie was very interesting to say the least but the word that best describes it would be dark. If you are looking for the feel good movie of the year you might want to look elsewhere.Though I couldn't feel much for the characters it is still a pretty decent movie. One thing it had going for it is the fact it was directed by the author of the original stories, allowing him to show us what the work means instead of another persons interpretation.At times it was hard to relate to the characters but as with any other movie, or book for that matter, if it's broken down to the most basic of human elements there is something there to grasp.Unless you are a fan of the directors work I would suggest renting this video."
1,Leaky,"I like writing with pens, especially gels and rollerballs. These are subtly stylish and write wonderfully, with a rich blue ink. Unfortunately, I've had several of them leak on my fingers (makes for a nice surprise when you are in class taking notes). Perhaps I got a bad batch or something. I really wanted to like these, but I just can't trust them."
3,"Good pens, but leaky","These pens are great for writing with. They have a very ""liquid"" feel to them, almost frictionless across the page. However, as another reviewer mentioned, these are leaky. I bought a box of the black ink pens also and they don't leak, so perhaps it was just a bad batch, or something, but it is very annoying to pause from writing and see my hand is completely blue. It has only happened two or three times in a whole semester of using only these pens, but infrequent leakiness is still not acceptable."
1,Embarrassing Leaks,"While I love the thinness of the lines that I'm able to write, I cannot stand how they often they leak all over the place. I received them a week ago, have attempted to use 3 of the 12 and already I have had to throw 2 of them away because they leaked all over my hands. It is really embarrassing to go to a client meeting with blue stains all over your hands."
2,"If you need it, you'll have to pay up!",Yes...this connector is very expensive for what it is. Should cost no more than a few bucks. But what can you do when Ford puts in cheap OEM connectors that break? You'll have to bite the bullet and pay for this replacement....until you get another car that is not a Ford product.
3,Still Not a Professional Program,"No save to PDF feature.No save to EPS feature.Don't let all the bells and whistles fool you... if you plan on taking your files to a printshop be sure they FULLY support Microsoft programs before you buy this program because it can cause a myriad of problems when outputting to postscript RIP devices such as image setters.Until Microsoft fully understands the printing process, this program should be used primarily by people who will be printing to a home desktop printer."
3,Publisher 2003 not as good as predecessor,"I purchased this Publisher upgrade because I lost my previous version of Publisher. I love Publisher, but this version for me was not as good as the old one. It is not as user-friendly. For example, In ""view"" I used to be able to ""Go to Background"", and vice versa. It was an easier way of using backgrounds. That feature is gone. There are other features that are not as good and most importantly, I was expecting improvements and don't see any."
2,Great looks and ergonomics but end result is nada,"The out of the box MP 2003 templates for print and web publishing are excellent and easy enough to manage but trying to get them online is an absoltue nightmare. Files become corrupted easily and directories get run through the grinder, so by the time you're ready to bring up your web site online it's become an FTP rat's nest. I've worked w/ 3 major host services and none of us could get an MP2003 generated site to work w/ all indexes, images and text attached and/or pointed in the right direction. I would go w/ the free Nvu.com software for a more stable web site creation. Code layout is easier to follow."
1,What a disappointment !!!!!,"I have been using Publisher 98 for some years and decided to upgrade to 2003. I have never had any problems with 98 and been very satisfied. Publisher 2003 is a whole different ballgame. I purchased it because of the webpage publishing and found that I could not successfully publish using 2003. I worked with a Microsoft specialist for over 2 weeks and we could not get the software to work properly. For me, Publisher 2003 is useless. I have gone back to using the old version and have absolutely no problems publishing my webpage to the internet."
5,It's a Microsoft product.,"Microsoft Publisher 2003 isn't much different than the other versions. I purchased it because I am in real estate and Microsoft has loads of templates for my profession in the 2003 version only. You might want to look at all the templates available to you before deciding. The program is so easy to use, it works like Word and PowerPoint. I think it should be part of the Office Suite and not something I should have to purchase separately. Microsoft products are what they are. They do the job...they are expensive, but without Microsoft we wouldn't be where we are right now...at Amazon.com."
2,Not too impressive,"I've used Publisher 98 since 1999 to do the Club's website and newsletter. I thought I'd upgrade (I can't remember why, but must have had a good reason), and was disappointed. Publisher 98 really spoiled me, and Publisher 2003 increases the complexity and loses the flexibility of '98. I uninstalled 2003, and am still using '98, and happy as a clam."
1,Great at getting my fingers covered in ink,"I've used these pens for years and have always loved how well they write. In fact, they're my go-to pen when I have a choice in the matter. Perhaps I got a bad box, but 95% of the pens I have used so far have leaked ink everywhere. I'm incredibly tired of having blue hands. I will not buy these again."
2,Well... um.....,"I've studied this war a bit and read some interesting books on the topic by some of the top historians, and I have to say that the producers of this film did not try very hard to fit in some key details in the time slot they alloted for this documentary. Many key events were completely ignored in favor of a popular view of history. It does not address the notion of the United States' overpowering desire to sieze Canada, nor of the intense unpopularity of the war in New England. Could have been done a lot better, as were many of the earlier documentaries done by The History Channel when it first premiered (check out The American Revolution - quite excellent!)."
3,Less for More Sometimes Better than More for Less,"The War of 1812, a two-DVD set by The History Channel, is overall a disappointment. The bonus program called ""Behind The Scenes of First Invasion: The War of 1812"" in Volume I does not add anything significant to the satisfactory narration of ""First Invasion: The War of 1812."" Most viewers probably do not have too much interest in knowing how The History Channel produces ""First Invasion: The War of 1812."" The bonus program looks like a filler. Volume II contains a program about ""The Ironclads"" that pertains to the Civil War, not to the War of 1812. Finally, the same volume contains another bonus program called ""Surviving an 1812 Battleship"" that is at best of marginal value. To summarize, The War of 1812 can best be forgotten due to its lack of value to history lovers."
4,History Chnl War of 1812,"A lot of paitriotism depicted in this video. Reveals the emotion and meaning of the words include in our National Anthiem. Now what we need is congressional mandate to sing it as written, without artistic renditions...when that happens I just cry."
1,The War of 1812: A load of tripe and a waste of time!,"This series is a huge waste of time and money. Here are some true facts: The War of 1812 was fought across a large part of Eastern North America and many common people lost their property and lives in a range of brutal ways. A sizeable portion of Washington D.C was and ransacked and burned by a combined British and Canadian Army after the U.S. Army fled in panic. The ""glorious"" Battle of New Orleans was actually fought after the end of hostilities (the combatants had not yet heard that the war was over). NO NATION WON THIS WAR, since at the end, all captured lands were returned to the original owners. So, where's the glory? The War of 1812 was legalized murder and anarchy and this film is pure patriotic spin. It's ""history"" for uneducated masses, and definitely not accurate."
3,A little diasappointing,"The program covers the the war with good segments on the beginning of the war and the end of the war, but with hardly a mention of what happened in between. There is hardly any mention at all of the Great Lakes reason and Oliver Hazard Perry, but most incongruently there is a segment on Civil War ironclads, which doesn't belong here at all. The segment with Roger Daughtry was amusing and did touch on life aboard ship, but still doesn't give a lot of historical information. I agree with the other reviewers that the portrayal of Madison is terrible (sort of like the movie where John Boy Walton played the part of Hank Williams Jr.), but the portayal of General Andrew Jackson was quite well done and believeable."
3,Entertaining History,"I live in the Lewiston/Queenston area, one of the battle sites of this war. There are numerous plaques and statues dedicated to this war on both sides. The people living around this area on the US side have no delusions about what happened. I am a Canadian living in the US and although the History Channel may produce this type of patriotic history drivel the locals aren't buying it, I have had some humorous banter with americans about them losing this war to Canada. I just wanted to set the record straight that just because HC makes it doesn't mean thats the opinion of americans, HC makes historical entertainment shows based on demographics and board room meetings. I will still watch there shows because they are entertaining but dig deeper for the real history."
2,somewhat disappointing,"I was somewhat disappointed by this 2 disk set. It ended up being a 2 hr. program on the war of 1812 with some similarly themed history channel programs. While the main program was informative, the additional programs repeated alot of info. 1 program, 'The Ironclads', had nothing to do with the war of 1812."
2,"History, but not as I knew it","Well in the UK we were taught that the US LOST the war of 1812, so it is interesting to see it being given the star bangled banner treatment.We were taught that the Americans got their **** whupped after invading Canada in a nakedly hostile act of conquest. Oh I know the programme rehashes some rather spurious pretexts but no one believed them then or should now. In any case, the truth is US forces were chased back across the border and got their capitol burned to the ground as a result. Now THERE'S a useful history lesson...The shame is that ""my-nation-right-or-wrong"" history like this breeds a righteousness that can be as damaging as helpful. If my nation can do no wrong then... how can it do wrong?"
1,Tales from a s-l-o-w-e-r era,"I bought this to listen to in the car with our children. It sounds like it is being read by aliens who learned English from ancient radio broadcasts, and who are speaking extra slowly to avoid making any mistakes. The diction is archaic, too: ""Who would be herald to mistress Spring?"" This may be good for putting your children to sleep, but it had my wife begging me to throw it out the car window. My eight-year old claims he likes it, though."
5,Really simple,"I've picked up many books which claim to demonstrate science with ""everyday materials."" Most times the ""everyday materials"" are not something I keep on hand. Like cheesecloth. Who keeps cheesecloth on hand? But the demonstrations in this book really are simple and really do include basic household supplies. I've used the book with my five year old and have found the demonstrations and explanations to be thorough enough to engage his interest. And I've enjoyed myself too!"
5,"When your kids say :"" I'm bored"", this is the book for them!","The experiments in this book are very basic and simple fun activities that are easy to follow and which children -even adults- will enjoy. The book simplifies and explains many fundamental scientific concepts that we encounter daily. The scope of these experiments is very wide , from daily science to weather, chemistry,... which are all implemented with very readily available items. This is a book that will keep inquisitive children motivated and busy for hours, they will especially love the science tricks. The second book : ""365 More Science Experiments with Everyday Materials"" complements this book. One should get them both!"
2,Other science book not worth reading,Most of the experiments are not worth it. I believe there's 2% of the book that is worth reading. I do not recommend.If you have very small children and no scientific knowledge maybe it can help
5,Donovan's Birthday,This item was purchased as a birthday gift for my now 7-year-old grandson. I looked through the book and it really seemed to have some interesting experiments that made use of items/ingredients that are commonly found in a household. It seemed to be well worth my investment.
5,Great little book on the Marmes Rock Shelter,"This book is 95 pages long with an index, size of book is 9"" x 6 3/4"", and hard cover first edition, dated 1970. Lots of black and white photos of the finds at the Marmes shelter. Included are descriptive chapters of the finds, and the efforts of the Federal Govt to ward off the waters of the rising lake, long enough to do more study of this important site. The efforts were in vain however and the Corps of Engineers lake, flooded the shelter. This excavation took place when I was active in archaeology and I understand what these people were up against and I enjoyed the reading of this book. Later day archaeologists who have no respect for the efforts of their forerunners may not enjoy it as much as I did. There is even a photo of one of the old carbon dating machines as they looked in about 1970, which is when I first got a look at one. Brought back a lot of memories. This is a great little book, and quite rare...highly recommend."
3,"1 and 3 year olds love this, but cheap latches","My 18 month old and 3 year old absolutely love this toy. It keeps both of them distracted for quite a while. It's a frustrating toy though as some of the latches won't stay shut. This doesn't seem to bother them, but when I pick it up to put it away, the doors will fly open. For the price of this toy, I would expect better quality."
3,I loved this but,"This really appealed to me, but I'm not convinced the kids liked it as much as I did. The ipad generation."
5,A great philosophical analysis of authority,This is the best philosophical analysis of authority I have been able to find (and I have read quite a few!). De George provides a number of useful categories for sorting through thorny issues regarding authority.
5,ROCKIN THE HOUSE,"IF YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME GROOVIN' JUMP BLUES, THE PRECURSER TO ROCK AND ROLL, WITH WILD PIANO AND HONKING SAX, AND THE LYRICS SHOUTED RATHER THAN SUNG, THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD. THIS CD IS LIKE DRINKING A DOUBLE SHOT OF ESPRESSO. IF YOU LIKE THE MUSIC OF AMOS MILLBURN, BIG JOE TURNER, EDDIE CLEANHEAD VINSON, OR WYNONIE HARRIS, THAN THIS IS FOR YOU, ALTHOUGH NONE OF THOSE ARTISTS ARE ON THIS CD, BUT IT DOES INCLUDE CUTS BY BIG JAY MCNEELY, ILLINOIS JACQUET, THE LIGGINS BROTHERS, AND A LOT OF OTHER GREAT ACTS FROM THE EARLY 50'S."
4,Afraid Of Noting,"Bumby-backed fish was sick, and need red algae to get better. So Rainbow fish, and Blue fish decided that hey would venture into the monsters cave where the red algae was. They had to do it unless bumpy-back fish would die. As they traveled through, they say many scary things, but were too afraid to actually look at the scary things. The fish finally made it out and were able to get some red algae. On their way back they found out something very interesting. This is a pretty good story that tells a moral on now to be afraid of something just because you don't know what it is, like being afraid of the dark."
5,Very scary!,"Well, it only scares my daughter when I read it in my spookiest voice, so I can tone it down if she gets scared. As long as I don't act too scary she loves it and the story and pictures are fun and give us stuff to talk about. A good book. We've liked all the Rainbow Fish books we've tried.Oh, these books have morals. This one seems to be about overcoming your fears and not being afraid of the unknown (things hidden in the dark)."
5,Rainbow Fish,Great book at a great price. A must add to your childs library. My son loves Rainbow Fish. Received the book sooner than expected.
2,"Product not in ""very good"" condition","The illustrations are well done and the story itself is satisfactory. The book, however, was rated as ""very good"" shape by Got Book, Inc, but pages are starting to fall out and there was torn white spots in the lower right and left corners of almost all the pages. It's too much trouble to return as the price was only the cost of shipping, but the condition of the book should be honestly rated."
4,"Nice detail, usual quality issues","A nice jump, accurately representing the real thing. Bigger than you might expect. Has the usual construction defects that I've come to expect in these sorts of Breyer accessories: round poles are frequently bowed, holes in standards for round poles are misaligned, etc. In spite of this they look great with my horses ""jumping"" over them!"
4,"works, but has its pros and cons","Does not work well in bright sun, but indoors, and when dark, the IR does well. I shoot weddings and local shows, and lighting is always changing, the Ettl is a must, and is also great as a auto-focus assist (really great in low light)."
3,Think before you leap,"The unit works well. I have a two speed lights, a 580 and a 430 EX and after using controller I think it would have been money better spend to buy third speedlight and use the 580 EX as the controller. The Canon Speedlight STE2 controls two groups of flashes, A & B. The 580 EX will control groups A, B & C."
4,EXCELLENT BUDGET ALTERNATIVE FOR POCKET WIZARDS,"I first bought this transmitter as an alternative to the pocket wizards. Most of the work I do with this transmitter is outdoors. Greats pretty good outdoors, even if both, the flash and the receiver are under direct sunlight (flash has fired every single time). Of course, since it is an infrared wireless trigger system, the only limitation you have is that the flash has to be in front or above the camera to be triggered. Outdoors, you have to be within a horizontal working distance of 10-15 feet, and you can be about 30 feet away from the flash within the horizontal working distance (although most of us, will be working within 12 feet of our subject). I would highly recommended. i even got to use it with an umbrella directly in front of the flash, and the flash could still be triggered without any problems."
4,Handy Little Gadget,"This handy little gadget does as it says and can control numerous remote speedlight flashes on up to 3 different channels, controlling their timing and brilliance. What is keeping it from getting 5 stars in my book is that the instructions on how to use it aren't very clear (that is hardly a surprise) and involved a fair amount of experimentation prior to use."
3,it's not excellent.. but it does the job.. usually,"I've been using this transmitter for over 2 years, and it does a good job.. but it doesn't handle obstacles very well, even indoor. I love the fact that it helps you focus even in extremely dark situations, very handy even when you are not going to trigger a flash. I've use it with canon and metz flashes and they both work great with it, you can graduate power between flash...Overall it's ok, especially because you don't need receivers connected to the flash. I wouldn't recommend it if you take most of your pictures outdoor."
5,Very handy tool,I purchased this little item to aid in taking pictures at my first wedding. It worked nicely in a large worship center using both the 550ex and 430ex Speedlites and a 30D. I still haven't used it to its fullest but continue to learn. I'll add more to this in the future but just wanted to comment on this handy tool. A little pricy I guess but what in photography isn't?
3,Not Impressed...,"I'm not impressed for several reasons:1) The build quality is poor... feels more like a toy compared with the flashes2) The thing didn't come with a battery, and uses an obscure battery type3) There is no sealing or locking mechanism for the hot shoe... you'll put it on a $250 flash, but not a $250 transmitter?4) No second curtain control... this is a big boooo to canon in general, who has turned their back on pro strobists and advanced hobbyists alike.Not sure I'm going to keep it, rather than spend $55 on a 30 foot ebay OCE3 cable that will maintain my rear curtain and doesn't need line of sight...Come on, Canon... get with the game."
1,"Please, do not waste your time or money!!!","Using the ST-E2 has been a very frustrating experience, the unit managed to fire off my EX 520 II speedlights half the time in a studio situation. Shooting outside with the unit was horrible! I am so disappointed in this product. Do yourself a huge favor and buy some radio triggers! I really hate this thing. I just ordered Aputure Trigmaster Plus Kit from Amazon, this has got to be better then the ST-E2."
2,Out of date,"I have tried the gadget before i bought it, so I knew its performance.It is about time that Canon replace or renovate the look and functionality of this equipment.The best for the users would be to just integrate it into the camera body, but this probably doesn't fit with the way Canon is making their mony, so..."
2,Disappointingly shallow!,"I had great hopes for this book after reading a couple of reviews. Was I ever disappointed! There is very little character development, so that you never get to know (much less care about) any of the players. And the plot skips along without much development either - people are acting in various ways that seem very contrived, not to mention pointless (Teddy's dam-building exercise and her ""rivalry"" with Steve are particularly silly).The book disappoints - the so-called great healing of the generations is touted as a main feature is as much a mystery at the end of the book as it was when it was first introduced. What does get explained (Didi in a high dudgeon because Rose did come to her when she was needed) is anticlimactic.Save your money folks"
1,Simply awful!,"This book was one of the worst books I ever read!The shallow plot is filled with plenty of profanityand heavy teen drinking, and should be banned! Thisbook was TORTURE!!!!! DO NOT READ IT!!!!! It SOUNDSgood, but it's really AWFUL!!!"
2,This book must be the worst ever written!,"When I chose this book to read for school, I thought that it would be good. I was very wrong. It has profanity and it encourages the drinking of alchohol. The plot and the charecters were not well devolped."
2,"Can you say ""FRUSTRATING""???","Just took this one out of the box and even with a college education I can't figure out how to make it work!!! My 4 year old little boy clicks around aimlessly trying to make something work, to no avail! Unless I'm totally missing something, there are no real instructions as to what to do to get things going, there's only a big to-do about the art show and portfolio."
2,Good examples,This book has very good examples. Do not read the theory from here. The autors contradict themselves at times. The examples are deep and explain the concepts.
2,Obsolete already. Written using Beta1,This book was written using the Beta 1 release. It is now obsolete and is no longer published.
4,Good Overview,"This is a good preview of the technology. It doesn't have a lot of in depth coverage of VB.Net and it is not current, but it is good to show you what can be done and what changes. It is sometimes confusing as to what is VB6 and what is VB.Net if you are not well versed in VB6."
3,good intro and guidelines (know-it-talls will profit),"Many GUI books are primarily about design, and are full of profound but essentially useless prescriptions such as ""Use space creatively"" or ""Your design should be balanced, but hey, asymmetry can be cool, too."" This book, in contrast, is primarily about GUI construction. The first part is about the mechanics of designing an interface: requirements gathering, prototyping, usability testing, and so on. The remainder is made up of checklists: Avoid horizontal scrolling; place pop-up windows in the center of the action; limit checkboxes to ten. The final chapter lists some best-practice guidelines with section headings like ""Who to Involve"" and ""What to Customize."""
5,Excellent guide to the process of creating User Interfaces,"This book provides an excellent and practical guide to the process of creating effective User Interfaces. I have used the GUI Design process as well as the Web design process successfully on a number of different projects. The techniques are described in a straight-forward, easy to understand manner. The guidelines and checklist templates are a great starting point. The User Interface Design Document template has been especially valuable for communicating how the interface should work to the development teams. It is quite easy to customize it to fit the needs of each project. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in introducing an Interface Design process to their development organization, or to anyone who needs to develop an effective Web site."
2,Definitely not worth buying or reading.,"This books seems to contain a great deal of information that has been distilled out many better books. It's content is very thin on any one topic, and it concentrates on structural features of the interface (like buttons and list boxes) without really getting to the meat of user interface design: task flow and behavior. Every topic covered has much better coverage elsewhere. Read Alan Cooper's _About Face_ for a much better discussion of behavioral design, Edward Tufte's _Visualization of Quantitative Information_ for information design, and Jakob Nielsen's _Usability Engineering_ for usability testing and heuristic evaluation instead. And keep a copy of Microsoft's _The Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design_ handy as a reference. The included CD-ROM is also a bust -- develop your own guidelines from scratch rather than using theirs."
4,So far a good product,"Wihtin minutes the moss turned black; however, I noticed that I should better use a hose connected sprayer, rather than a regular manual sprayer. The moss really needs to get deeply soaked for the product to work properly."
5,Improved car performance,Had a difficult time removing old worn out o2 sensor but it was worth it for the improved engine performance during warm up and slight mileage improvement.
5,Excellent reference book,"I absolutely love this book. I think it would be useful to both new and seasoned crocheters. Gorgeous photographs, and great instructions for all stitches."
5,"A Bible, Indeed!","I've crocheted for over 20 years. I've coveted this book since it first hit the shelves at my local craft store, but I thought the price was exhorbitant. I finally bought it last night with a combination of ""birthday"" money and a 40% off coupon. Gosh, why did I wait so long? It's worth every penny. I love the photography, and the directions are straightforward. Another great book by Betty Barnden, the crocheting guru herself!!!"
3,Nothing for left-handed beginners.,"I got ahold of this book because I was a beginning crocheter looking to expand my stitch knowledge, and to have a reference when I wanted to work on any sort of project with a more uncommon stitch.The stitch listing was fantastic and the pictures and instructions were well done, and the book was in a great size and format. However, I found the vague reference to lefties, ""tip: if you're left handed, hold this book up to a mirror"" in the instructional section insulting. It is impossible to look at the illustrations in a mirror and read the instructions at the same time, all while trying to hold yarn and a hook and teach your hands to do something completely new."
5,The Crochet Stitch Bible,"I felt this book was very informative. It is simaliar to the Readers Digest Book written years ago, which I can no longer find. The pictures and directions make things so easy to follow."
2,Need more contrast in photos,I was very disappointed with this book. The yarns used for photos were in various colors of cream/light yellow. This lack of contrast made it very hard to really see stitch detail.A much better book is Robyn Chachula's Crochet Stitches Visual Dictionary. The photos and diagrams are much better quality.Crochet Stitches VISUAL Encyclopedia (Teach Yourself VISUALLY Consumer)
2,I'M AFRAID TO BUY THIS BOOK AFTER THE REVIEWS I'VE READ,"I really wanted to but this book to increase my knowledge of the charted way to crochet,but after looking at some of the pages with the light charts, which are hard to see even on the computer, I don't know if I want to spend the money on this book. I think that I'll check it out at the library first. I don't know why authors and publishers have to go out of their way to make things fancy and new, like not printing things in black ink, when we are just trying to learn something or follow a chart. I really blame the publisher.I started to learn the charted method in the book Blueprint Crochet. It has some nice lacy sweaters to crochet and the instructions are very clear. Be sure to read the introduction first."
5,I like it!,"I never really had any classes in crocheting but rather learned some basics from my Mother and can ""just get by"" if I have the patterns. But since I purchased this reference I've been back to it multiple times to find out what I should do in certain cases. It has been invaluable to me and would recommend it to anyone regardless of their abilities."
5,is really a bible!!!,"omg.. this book have a lot samples, and very easy to understand, and it have a picture for every single pattern."
3,The color photographs are not defined,"It's a nice spiral-bound book with lots of stitches. However, I had a hard time seeing the pictures clearly. I wish the yarn was darker in many of the photographs. Also, the charts they show are barely readable because they're printed so light."
2,"6 Disks under 20 bucks, Is it too good to be true?!?!",YES! I knew it was too good to be true. There are maybe 7-10 tracks that are worth listening to. Horror House by Psychic TV is on the comp. twice! And what's with all the covers! Love Cats by the The Crue (that's right! The CRUE NOT the CURE) And it's a horrid cover at that. If you want a GREAT GOTH COMP try the BLACK BIBLE or the GOTH BOX. Or even GOTHIK. They're all available through Amazon.com. Don't waste your money on Gothic Erotica.
2,Doesn't keep its promise,"Most of the songs included in this box are, in my opinion, neither goth nor erotic. Moreover, the songs seem to be put in random order, making this collection sound incoherent. Some of the songs I enjoyed, but I don't think I would have bought this box set if I had listened to it before."
2,If you are an old school 'goth' do not buy this set.,Gutter Decor..Trash. All I can say is that this set was quite the disappointment. It's a waste of your money and I feel the fool for purchasing it. I should have thrown the set in the trash but have it sitting on my cd rack for the principle alone. If you want to purchase some erotic gothy music go buy the Black Bible. That's your best bet.
3,"not bad, but not great...","This collection isn't so much ""bad"" as it is a re-hashing of almost every single compilation that Dressed To Kill records puts out, and they've been releasing a lot of six-disc compilations lately. If you buy this, make sure that you check the track listing on every other DtK comp you consider buying ever again, as I can gaurantee that about two-thirds of the track-listing will be exactly like this one.Other than that, it's a decent collection of proto-goth bands from the early 1980s - do NOT expect Marilyn Manson heavy-metal-aggro-industrial music, but instead expect punk and glam-rock influenced music (as in *real* punk and glam rock) and a couple Lydia Lunch tracks."
2,Terrible cd.......i could find better trash in my garbage!,"First of all, it is not Crue who sings the Lovecats. Properly spelled the Cure. Ha! Second of all, no one but Bauhaus should be performing Bela Lugosi's Dead. This cd disgusts me. Most of it is terrible goth music at best."
2,goth? old school goth? hardly.,"when i hear ""gothic erotica"" i hear sexy, twisting electronic melodies with seductive vocals. )i'm not going to say this isnt goth; about twenty years ago it was. this is, well, old goth. 80's goth. you can imagine how much goth has evolved from that. so dont expect anything current or ""new"" to be on this cd.now goth is definetly connected to romanticism. there might be like...well...five romantic songs? this cd is mostly kinky. .the thing is they'd be better off putting out two cds with the best songs . really. dont buy this unless you are a fan of bands like bahaus, cure, alien sex fiend etc. this sounds KINKY not SEDUCTIVE...ok? i'm done."
1,Did not work,"This software did not work. I followed the instructions. Would not install on my computer. Would not purchase again. In fact, I did not even return it. : ("
1,Doesn't load on any system!,I just can't get this to load on any system. I sent emails to the support contact listed with the CD and nobody has gotten back to me. I am very frustrated with both the lack of support and the false product description.
3,caveat emptor - great pens but mediocre buying experience.,"these pens are fantastic, but i was expecting to get a box of 12 (per the item name) for this price. unfortunately, i received 1 pen for each ""box"" i ordered... the company wound up offering a 90% refund on the whole order, but if i bought them singly at the local surplus office supply store i would have paid less.overall, GREAT pens but won't be ordering from this company again.advice: contact the seller and confirm that you're getting what you think you are - nothing has changed on the listing as of the date of this post, and they ascribed the issue with my purchase to an ""Amazon listing error"" (anyone with experience listing with amazon will know that the company made the error, not amazon - amazon doesn't control the listing for sellers like this."
3,disappointed in pens,"I did not get what I ordered, which was a dozen of the uni-ball vision micro pens. Instead I received a dozen of the Uni-ball vision exact needle point pens. It's more than a name change. they are not the same pens. but it did not seem worth the trouble to send them back.I think the ones I got are pretty good, not quite as good."
2,Disappointed,"Bought this headset in March 2009. Good sound quality, however, recently the wires where the mic attaches to the headset are broken, causing a ""muffled"" sound and sometimes voice cuts out altogether. Could be alot better made."
4,Gardner weaves the magic of math,"Gardner weaves the magic of mathematics again in this awesome math ""thriller"". After 'Time Travel', this is the second book I read, and I think Gardner does a wonderful job of going about math in a non-boring way. At some points of time, I had difficulty understanding whether I am supposed to be a complete novice or an advanced student, hence the 4 stars."
5,great!,go green and use refills. i love having these as these pens are great but run thru ink quickly. so i always keep spare refills around. price is good.
1,Discontinued Item,I emailed McDougall's Right Foods and they stated that this item has been discontined. There are no plans to bring it back. Sorry to see it go. These products are great for those of us who do not like to cook from scratch.
3,Much to small,"It is a very nice litter box if you have only one cat. We have two and one goes in the front of the box and the other in the back. They would get close enough to each end to go and end up wetting the bottom of the litter deodorant holder at the back and out over the front of the box.Actually the box is much smaller than I thought it would be. Our cats are around 12 lbs. and the Siamese is quite long so there was not near enough room for them.We went and purchased a PetMate large litter box which is just perfect.One other thing we didn't like about that litter box was there was no wayto secure the lid, very unhandy.Thanks anyway,J Anthony"
5,Another endorsement,"I took mine from someone's desk, and he or she won't see it again. Smooth and bold inkflow, and a comfortable grip. The champagne of disposable pens."
5,These pens are fantastic,"In the digital age, who wants to waste money on expensive pens? Not me, that's for sure. I bought these because of the great reviews and am very pleases by the pen and ink quality for the price. They write very well and last quite a while. Even my poor penmanship looks better with these pens. Good buy."
5,Love this pen,"My attorney gave me one to sign a contract and I must admit that I was happier than one should be about an inexpensive pen to get to keep it. After using the pen for another few days, I got online and ordered a box. It just feels right and writes very smooth. No one should fall in love with an object (even a smart phone or car!), much less an ink pen but I think I love this one. What else can I say?"
5,The best pen ever,"I am a writer, and my pens have to be perfect. This pen is perfect. It's my first choice for any writing that I have to do. It's smooth and clear and is simply a joy to use. I look forward to note taking and writing by hand because I have a chance to use my UVE pen. I would highly recommend this pen to anyone looking for a high quality writing experience."
2,Wasn't Impressed,"I purchased these strictly based on the reviews, but honestly, I'm not sure what the hype is all about. The pen is attractive, the ink does dry fast, and it's certainly comfortable to hold. However, actually writing with it was a very disappointing experience. It felt scratchy/rough on the paper, wasn't what I would consider to be smooth, and didn't lay down much ink. I personally liked the Bic z4 Needle Point (0.5mm) much better, but they are no longer available in 0.5mm.UPDATE: Just purchased Pentel EnerGel liquid ink gel pen in 0.7mm. Ink dries fast. Comfortable to hold. Writes smooth. Made in Japan. Much nicer pen than the Uni-ball Vision Elite - I would say there is no comparison. If you're concerned about the size (0.7mm) don't be, you can write very fine print with this."
1,This is NOT a 3-part refill,"I really like the Humidipak system and use it with confidence for my Taylor 614ce. But this particular item comes with a gotcha:Dispite the item image shown above, this is NOT a complete refill kit for your Planetwaves Humidipak System. This is a single pouch. You need three to refill the system. At this price you can purchase the complete kit for less than these refills would costs. I am returning mine for a refund due to the misleading product description and product image."
2,"Fine, but pricey.","Yes - it works well. But this is one humidipak refill. You'll need to buy three to replace the whole system. Which, at the current price here, is the same cost of a full kit (if not more expensive). Other online retailers sell this for half the cost."
3,Good Idea - But Not In Phoenix,"Before I bought this product, I asked how long between packet changes. ""3 months at a minimum"". Well, I live in the last of sub-10% RH, Phoenix. My packs lasted less than 1 month, and that's with non-dry guitars, quality instruments, quality cases (TKL and the OEM Taylor case for my Taylor), and only 1-2 openings per day on my classical and ZERO openings on my Taylor since installing the system. Think I'm going to add a single old-style case humidifier and see if it helps. May work fine if you're in a wetter environment."
1,Poor performance in Arizona,"I live in Phoenix, AZ and get about one month our of the Humidipak before they dry up...No good for dry areas..."
1,Don't buy this! A waste of money! Use Zorb-it!,I bought this product but the packages were hard after 2 weeks and I had to throw them away!Since then I used ZORB-it. It is in my guitar case now for 5 months and keeps my guitar comfortably between 48-50% humidity.It is MUCH MUCH cheaper and works forever and ever....Nice bussinessmodel for Planet Waves! Bad for you!
3,Nice Try,"I brought this to give it a try as the concept sounded good. However, it falls short. The problem is that it's very difficult to sharpen or put an edge on the lead so you get very thick marks. When you try to sharpen the lead with your knife, it usually breaks off. There are indentations in the lead that allow the holder to dispense the lead with a push of the cap. The knife gets caught on the grooves and breaks. You can however sharpe the lead by rubbing it on sandpaper. It'll keep my old fashioned carpenter pencils."
5,Very well made!,"I purchased this wagon as a cat carrying vehicle from my house to my car and from my car to the Vet's office. A large carrier fits perfectly. Another bonus is I can open the door without partially lifting up the carrier, which causes less anxiety for my cats. I have a Radio Flyer as well. In comparison, the John Deere wagon is so much better. Everything about it is sturdy construction. Not a scratch on the paint. Impeccable!"
1,doesn't conform to DSM,"Unfortunately, section of this text do not comform to the DSM diagnostic constructs and are highly questionable."
3,alex,actually i didn't purchase this becuase it's only available in cassette. but this song is wonderful.
1,This is a terrible book,"This is the first review I have written and the reason is because this book is exceedingly bad. I was very disappointed in the book.The interviews and photos concentrate on people with poor opinions of the USA. It seems that Lauri Lyons went out of her way to find the dregs of society to interview and photograph. There are many negative and hateful comments about the USA and I can't imagine why any publisher would publish this book.I believe in the constitution, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press. But, why would they print such a tasteless book? This is not real America.There are some nice exceptions, such as the cowboys in Montana and many old timers. However, there are photos showing people standing on the flag and stories about how people threw the flag she gave them on the ground.She had a good idea and an excellent theme. She blew it.M. R. Hansen"
3,Snore,"It's too easy for a gear head like me to order books like this. This book can give you a pamphlet history about effects which are overused and antiquated. If you're a gearhead like me you'll probably buy this book, but you should realize beforehand that you'll never own any of the boxes described here unless you're willing to pay way, way too much for them and are prepared to be disappointed. Spend your money on good effects devices (or lessons) rather than waste your money on a ... book like this.Gets 3 stars because there aren't any other books quite like it, and it's amusing to read about the stories. I just think that all these old effects are overrated because of the increasing tendecy to treat rock n' roll like classical music."
2,"Entertaining, but not useful","This book is basically a collection of examples of successful products. It breaks down the reasons for success into three areas: good design, usefulness and timing. The problem is while it covers the concepts of creating a well designed product that is useful to many people, it doesn't cover the timing issue. This leaves the book rather flat and overly simplistic. Perhaps if it covered some great product ideas that were useful and well designed but flopped in the marketplace (think Apple Newton) we would be able to draw some conclusions about the timing issue...make something that helps people more easily do something they already do or want to do, make sure it's well designed and user tested but not too expensive and just hope your timing is right."
5,"One of the BEST ""business"" books ever written - INC mag","Dr. Rogers is a brilliant sage whose lifelong quest for understanding how and why people adopt or deny innovation began, he tells me, on his family's farm in Iowa as a boy. At a young age he observed that some farmers were quick to adopt the latest innovations while many others were slower or even resistant to change. He also noticed that adoption didn't always equal success, nor did the refusal to change. So whether your gig is plowshares or computers or languages or healthcare or just about anything, you will find this book fascinating and illuminating. The book takes an ""innovation"" tour around the globe and through history with poignant examples of how new ways are diffused into societies. INC. magazine recently named this book as one of the 25 most important books written for understanding commerce. Ev is truly one of the wise men of today."
5,THE classic book,"There are so many dull 'contemporary' marketing books about viral, street, grassroots, etc marketing strategies. This is the KEY book about understanding how new products get accepted. Wonderful, deep research."
5,This is a great book,"I would recommend this book to all parents, it gives you great ideas on how to help your child feel better abought themselves and also things that you shouldnt do or say that you dont even really know effects them negatively."
3,USED A PONY!,"The most interesting (perhaps the only interesting) section of the book involves a letter Nietsche wrote to a friend in which he recommended a pony (foreign language book with the lines of the foreign language alternating with a translation). One can imagine that someone with an ego like Nietzsche had wished he had not left that admission behind.The author is a professor of Western civilization at a small public university in Ohio. He makes the claim that the republican black-red-gold flag of 1848 was also the flag of the German Empire, 1871-1918. Nope."
1,'The Same Freudian Angle'-beaten dead horse the Herd comes back to time and again,"The title of the review says it all. Nothing you haven't heard, the man's youth is only of interest to resentment consumed non-entities. This book is not worth anyone's time; it may not even deserve a reference for refutation . . . See R J Hollingdale for a biography worth your time."
5,Dr. Rao is an expert,"CHILD OBESITY: A PARENT'S GUIDE TO A FIT, TRIM AND HAPPY CHILD provides parents with tips for overweight kids and controlling weight. Dr. Rao is an expert on child obesity: he identifies here five principal culprits for obesity among children, explaining a rational approach to helping kids achieve and maintain a healthy weight."
2,90's flashback,"Great find if you're into the whole 90's gangster thing. Synthesizers, funk bass lines, and hardcore lyrics by MC Eight round out this selection.It by no means is a great album, but if you're in the mood for some music to drive by, this is it. Note the selection with Scarface, that song is the shiz. Also he's got a cut on here that was on San Andreas, and that song bumps. There's other west coast selections I would suggest before this one, but this ain't bad."
4,4 1/2 - Jimbo At His Best!,"I have all of Jimbo's CDs, and enjoy them all to varying degrees, but this is the one I seem to come back to most often. It is definitely a back-porch affair, that never takes itself too seriously. The songs are warm, playful, and upbeat. Even though it is an entirely acoustic album. it is possibly his blusiest recording. There is plenty of slide guitar, fiddle, mandolin, and even kazoo. Of course, Jimbo's vocals are masterful throughout. The songs are strong from start to finish. It's definitely a great album, maybe his best."
5,Genes,I enjoyed the book immensely. The book has good information about places that do genetic testing to trace human migration.
3,Trace Your Roots with DNA,"The book goes into more DEEEtails than I would like. Also, in the fast changing world of DNA research, it is already quite outdated. It does offer a few ideas on doing research--some for the novice, and some for the experienced genealogy researcher--but seems to leave the middle majority out in the cold."
3,"Useful, but could be better","Helps to clarify the most commonly used terms in genetic genealogy. But goes off-topic with details concerning paternity tests, etc. Additionally it seems to go too far in making the case for forming online groups to identify potential connections. Would be a lot better if it stuck more to the topic of using genetics in genealogy and spent more time discussing the various tests in the marketplace and the existing sites associated with them."
4,a good read,"If you have ever wondered if someone who looks like you or has your same last name or last name that is spelled a little differently from you, you can now find out. No needles but a simple test, genetic test, will allow you to find out.This book tells you about all you need to know about DNA testing and if you are tested it will hellp tell you which region your African ancestors came from.Wow, interesting reading.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,Okay,I ordered this offline not realizing it wasn't the micro point. The fine points tends to let too much ink out and the ink flow is not continuous at times.
5,Thumbs up!,"Very nice football. Was worried about it being synthetic, but once I received it, I really couldn't tell the difference. Wanted a nice long-lasting ball for throwing around the yard in the fall, and I got it. The price was the best anywhere even with shipping."
2,WARNING! WARNING!,"I purchased the 24 tubes of chapstick for 24.99.I read the review of the person that just received 1 tube. Guess what I also only received 1 tube for the low price of 24.99.I e-mailed amazon(the only way to reach them)and they returned my letter stating they would credit my card,so I think that you can not get 24 tube boxes?. They advised me they we going to correct the info. but I see they have not done it yet.The one tube though is great."
5,A true family pack,Everyone must love strawberry chapstick. I go to the store and they are always cleaned out. Happened to be surfing amazon and found this 24 pack. I received all 24 chapsticks. I just wish my kids would stay out of my supply!
3,Poodle Grooming,Gives a wide variety of poodle grooming styles. I would like to see more on starting out a poodle puppy with grooming.
2,Its Caribbean,"I was glad to know that there was this gospel cd but I expected more from the artists. I like the fact that all the artists were Christians. The ballards were nice but too simple.I am looking for an album I heard played on the radio while I was visiting London with various Caribbean artists, I thought this was it.I enjoy gospel music and look forward for more music with island beat but, the productions must be great!"
1,I LOVE THIS PEN!! DON'T KNOW WHY I CAN'T GET RED REFILLS............,"I LOVE THESE PENS. I CAN GET BLACK AND BLUE REFILLS, BUT CAN NOT GET THE RED REFILLS!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE RED IS WHAT I USE THE MOST OF...... VERY DISAPOINTED THAT THE RED REFILLS ARE NOT OFFERED!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Losers,What a waste of time following the colts. Most true football fans know that the Colts died when they were stolen from Baltimore by Indianapolis.
4,Good times!,"First of all, the cast is awesome.John Ratzenberger, Jennifer Aniston pre-nose job, Danica McKellar, Breckin Meyer, Jaleel White, Candace Cameron Bure- you don't get much more 90s that this cast! I remember watching this movie with my sister all the time when we were younger, but then the VHS was misplaced.That rap... oh my. Too funny! And, this is actually quite family friendly, despite the lothario after Jenniger Aniston's character and the occassional innuendo- most will go right over kid's heads."
3,Just a little too small,I bought this bag for my husband and he was a bit disappointed in the size. He can barely quiz camera and lens in. Wasn't interested in returning it thought. I'll be sure to measure next time. S. Nichols
2,A little smaller than expected,"From other people's review, especially those with photos, I expected this to hold my t3i with its kit lens comfortably. Unfortunately, I have to push a little to get it in every time. I have to pull at the neck of the lens to get it out. Overtime, I am afraid it will do more harm to the camera than the money I saved from not buying the real camera bag.I blame no one, but the frugal myself (-:"
2,Too small,"I had to return this case because it was just too small for my new Canon Rebel t10, and just a few accesories that I have."
5,Love the Zoom!,"I finally bought the zoom lens I've been looking at for years...the bag helps keep it safe, nice and compact!"
2,Very Small,"This product is not as described. It is very small and only has room for one camera body with zoom lens attached. I wanted to keep my telephoto in with it but really have to cram it all in. Quality is good, I like the heavy duty zipper but needs to be at least 4 inches larger to be of any use. This is not deluxe and there is no room for gadgets."
4,"great looking bag , serves the purpose well","Great looking authentic canon bag, serves the purpose well. My only complain is its a bit on the smaller side, and is only big enough to carry you camera, the kit lens and one other medium sized lens."
5,Bag,Exclente para proteger el cuidado de mi camaraMuy buena para transportarlaMas economica que en las tiendas especializadasLlego en el timepo acordado!!
2,Not the bag for a DSLR camera!!,This bag says that it will hold up to 1-2 camera bodies AND 3-4 camera lenses..... BULL! It doesn't even hold my Canon DSLR Camera AND ONE lens! Really?
4,Almost perfect,"I've been using this bag for several months now and it has worked really well for me. I have a Canon T3i and only have one lens, and everything fits almost perfectly. I only wish they had a larger pouch at the top where I could put my external mic, but other than that, everything I use fits neatly in the bag. It seems to be of good quality and I think it will last for a long time to come."
5,Great for noobs,"I bought this bag for my newly purchased T2i. I'm new to the world of photography and wasn't really sure what would be a good starting point. I read a lot of reviews on Amazon regarding all kinds of different bags and was sold on this one. The bag is very sturdy and has every thing that you would need. The inside is well cushioned and has plenty of space for a camera and additional lenses (I have an 18-135 and macro lens in mine, fits perfectly). Extra storage for batteries, memory cards, and charger. Well made, great price, awesome bag."
4,A good small bag,"I can fit my T1i (with lens on) and one (extra) lens/flash in this bag. Also, memory cards and extra battery can be kept in the pocket. In summary, a good small bag. If you need to store more than one extra lens, then this bag is too small."
4,Its a good deal...,"The product is good and matches the spec's given. Likes:1) Metal clamps for the bag.2) very strong shouler strap3) Sturdy feeling.4) Well padded.Dislikes:1) With a lens attached, and an additional lens to store, it becomes cramped for space.Good stuff to buy."
5,Exactly what I need,"It's a great bag for a DSLR+ one extra lens. Unlike the other DSLR Bags the size of this bag is just right,Prons: Great QualityPerfect size for one DSLR and 1 lensSmall and very convenientCons: Some Certain DSLR's won't fit perfectly with an extra lens specially if it's a 50mm-250mm.My DSLR is EOS Canon Rebel T3 (or 1100D) which is a bit smaller than the other EOS camera's thus I am not facing any problems in terms of size. it fits my Camera and a SIgma 75mm-300mm Lens.I would Recommend all my friends to get these bags"
5,Love this bag!,"It's got plenty of room for your camera and two lenses, plus all your extras (battery charger, cleaning pen, ect.). I would highly recommend this to all photographers! Fast shipping too!"
5,Best bad ever,My canon 3T fits nicely in the bag. Also enough room to keep my cyber shot and the battery chargers. Its very rough and tough and has absorbed enough shocks already. The great product!!
1,Too Small for Rebel + Lenses,"Whomever from the manufacturer stated that the bag can carry up to two bodies and 3-4 lenses and accessories, was thinking about a different bag. I am returning this bag as with just the accessories from the Rebel kit, it is way too tight."
4,Great quality... yet a bit small.,"I would have rated this bag with ***** if it would have been a little bit larger.It will fit only a SLR camera with its lens on. No aditional space. Actually, there are some good spots to keep your extra flash cards, you extra battery and charger.So, if you want to move around with your SLR with at least two lenses, get a bigger one."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I returned this camera bag shortly after I received it because it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. The product itself is perfectly fine and does as it describes. It may be a bit small, but is not advertised to be a large camera bag. This bag is great for carrying and storing your camera and one or two lenses, but that is about it. What I was looking for was a bag that would allow me to easily access my camera and I found that in a different camera bag."
5,It just right for two lens kit,"This size is just for two lens kit, and has the protection of soft fiber, and rain drop protection as well."
5,Perfect Bag,I bought this for my Canon EOS Rebel XS/1000D camera. The camera fits perfectly. I like the two moveable dividers inside because they allow you to store the camera with the lens attached to the camera or separated. It also keeps the camera and lens very snug. I feel like my camera is very safe in the bag. The bag itself is very lightweight.
2,Canon XTi didn't fit,This bag was nice and well constructed but my Canon XTi did not fit nicely inside. There was no room for anything else and I had to take out the dividers just to fit my camera in. When the camera was in the bag without the dividers the camera moved around a lot. I returned the bag.
1,Poor,"Misleading information, very small, not easy to carry, bad product quality, can't hold a single camera and lens kit. Claims false."
1,SOOOOOO SMALL!!,"This is such a disappointing purchase. The bag is way to small to carry anything but my Canon Rebel. I was looking for something bigger that could also accomadate my flash and extra lens. On the plus side, the bag does seem sturdy and yet lightweight. However, if you wanted a bag to carry some of your accessories this is not the one!!"
2,Good Small bag,"I recently bought this item for my Canon T2i , This bag is very solid and looks very safe to the camera. The zipper & straps in the bag are very good.Comfort : I tried to place my Canon T2i with 18-55 Lens attached and 55-250 lens .it fits all of them but bit tight. I am not sure I can take this camera out quickly from the bag, if I have to. But i like the fact that it's small bag not bulky at all & I think I need to compromise comfort fit for this size."
3,can't keep promise what it can hold!,This bag is too small! You can't pack in it what it actually says! Couldn't pack my camera + an extra lens in it!
5,Great buy,"The camera bag that came with my camera was too big and burdensome to carry, so I found this one which is sooo much better and more convenient. It holds my canon rebel and two lens easily. Not a lot of room for the CD's and manual that came with the camera, but then again I do not need to carry these other items around so that isn't an issue. Very happy with this purchase."
5,Great small bag,"The Canon Deluxe Gadget Bag 100EG is great for day trips. It is ideal for folks who just want to bring a long their camera and perhaps one lens. If you need more space, I would recommend it's cousins the Canon Deluxe Gadget Bag 10EG or the Professional 1EG. The bag is very sturdy, a bit small. I have purchased the Professional 1EG as well. I plan on having many years of use with both bags."
4,Pretty good camera bag,"If you do not carry to much stuff like lens, booklets with you, this is the bag for make your camer being safe."
2,The Photos are Wrong,The photos on this page do NOT go w/this bag. My camera barely fits in this bag on it's own and forget about putting the camera with lens attached + spare lens in here.
5,very nice but too wide,"I had to return this bag because it was too bulky for my needs. I wanted to carry my video camcorder (Canon M30 and Canon SX20) together, which it can but it is so wide (width); 7-8 inches! However, it is an excellent quality bag that could easily cost twice as much. Very well made; material, zippers, straps are all 1st class. Inside dimensions are 8.5-9 "", 6.5-7"" height and 6"" width. Has a large front pocket."
5,Canon camera bag,The Canon camera bag was perfect for our video camera and extra supplies. It is a quality product that will last us for years.
5,Perfect fit!,"I have the Cannon Rebel XT and the 75-300 lense. They fit perfect in this bag. I can also fit my extra battery, charger, cords and manual. If I ever get another lense I would have to get a bigger bag...but for now it is perfect!"
4,Tough Little Bag,I bought this bag through Amazon because the one I used on vacation held only my digital point and shoot. While this bag won't hold all my cameras it will manage my SLR and my point and shoot plus a few other things like a phone and batteries. It also has the ability to be used as a fanny pack with the self contained waist strap which leaves hands free and no concern about the bag flopping around. This bag is extremely well made and secures everything with padding and a zipper as well as a rain flap. This is the bag I will grab most often for short or impromptu outings. I have a larger Canon bag which is also very well made. It is worth the investment. I like it
5,Great bag,"I am very pleased with the bag. It is stylish and very professional looking. It is well padded to keep my camera secure, with room for a lot of accessories. There are multiple ways to carry the bag, including a shoulder strap, a waist strap and the handle on top."
4,Great Travel Bag,"Like other posters, I agree about the descriptive copy being misleading. But, my Nikon D200 with 18-200 lens fits in this bag (lens hood clipped in storage position). No room for other lenses or flashguns. I had to collapse the gear-dividers and put them on the bottom of the bag for extra padding, to get the camera to fit. Plenty room for three extra batteries in the outside pocket and memory cards on the inside, with room to spare for minimal cleaning supplies. It's a travel bag, a very sturdy and relatively light product. Study the dimensions before purchasing to avoid whining after the fact."
2,Way Too Small,"After reading rave reviews about the capacity, I was confident the bag would accommodate my Rebel xsi body, one short lens and multiple other accessories.Big disappointment.The bag held only the camera body and lens--just barely. This rendered the bag entirely useless.The bag is very attractive. I cannot attest to its ruggedness or reliability, as other reviewers have done.If you have a Rebel xsi, choose the bag made for that camera. It isn't as attractive, but it is a much better choice for that camera and lots of gear."
2,good construct but small,This is a very well constructed bag but if you plan on carrying more than one camera and lens set-up; you'll need a bigger bag. I have a Canon XSI with 18-55 lens and a 75-300 lens that just barely fit without any extra needed gear. Go with the bigger bag.
2,Good bag for camera only,"This bag is very small. My Canon 20D fits nicely with a small lens, but you cannot fit more than one lens with the camera body. We kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag."
3,Misleading description,The description led me to believe this bag was larger than it is. I can get my camera and an extra lens in the bag but that is about it. I was hoping for a little more space.
4,Satisfied,"i am giving 4/5 is because of size of this bag. overall it was a very good choose and i am really satisfied with the product. if you are looking for a camera bag that can contain your camera and single lens, charger and cables, it can be suitable for you. it can not keep more than those stuffs."
1,Way Too Small....,"I went to a sporting goods store, bought a true water proof carry bag thats twice the size and was half the price. Now my Dig. Rebel, PLUS a second point and shoot dig. camera, 2 lenses, Canon's 420 flash, multi filters, charger and cleaning products fit with room to spare. Don't rush out to purchase this bag, you'll regret it."
5,Better than described.,This is an incredible buy. I saw it in Target for twice the price and bought it here instead. Lots room for all your goodies. AND. It's incrediblt well built ! really. I can't describe how nice it is.. Buy it.
2,Not As BIG as advertised!,"A well made bag, but the description is misleading....It reads ""Waterproof bag holds 1-2 cameras and 3-4 lenses with room for accessories"". You could possibly hold four small or medium lenses, without anything else and NO accessories. You could carry two camera bodies and some film but NO lenses. But there is no way to put two bodies, and 3-4 of the smallest lenses without removing all the padding and dividers - Then you'd might as well throw them all in a plastic sack and save your money.I bought this for a Digital Rebel and regular lens - a flash and one telephoto lens and two batteries. It is busting at the seams, and I have ordered the battery pack/grip to go onto the bottom of the camera so I'll probably have to reorder a larger one.If you want a good looking canon bag that is small and compact, you'll like it, and it is well made and worth the current cost, just remember it is smaller than the description would lead you to believe....."
1,Beware of the advertised size!,"I bought the 100EG for my Canon EOS-10D with a Canon 28-135mm IS lens and a Canon 420EX flash. My camera with the lens attached BARELY fits in the bag, and only after all the dividers are removed. A longer zoom wouldn't have fitted, period. Very dissapointed with the ""1-2 camera bodies, 3-4 lensees, ""AND"" accessories"" claim. Sure, if you own toy cameras. What's the point of removing the dividers? As far my setup, this bag is only good for 1 body and 1 small/medium lens, NOTHING else (as far as camera components), not even my Canon 420EX flash. Also, the waist strap is annoying since it pretty much useless and CAN'T be removed. I do, however, like the build quality and looks. I am going to gamble on the 10EG and HOPE to get ONE camera body, TWO lenses, and ONE flash in it. You'd think Canon would know how many of their OWN components could fit in their own bag!!! It's too bad Canon doesn't post more views of this bag with an example camera and lenses inside."
4,Great Starter Bag,"I was looking at all of the other reviews before deciding to purchase this bag for myself. When the bag arrived I found that it fit my Canon Digital Rebel w/ battery grip, my 50mm EFS lens, and all the cables that came with the rebel as well as the battery charger. I have used this bag for a month or so now and it has held up well. After purchasing a 75-300mm lens I had to upgrade my bag as the 100EG would not hold everything anymore. If you are looking for a starter bag to hold a camera body, a lens maybe two, and a flash then this bag is perfect. Anything more than this I would recommend something a little bigger like the 10EG or 1EG from Canon."
5,Bigger Than It Looks,"I bought this (elsewhere for more $) for my Canon T1i and its kit lens. I now have the DSLR w/lens, a Canon G10, a small flash, spare batteries and chargers for each, and memory cards, and there is easily room for another lens.Don't be swayed to a too-big bag by the naysayers. :)"
5,Great Beginner Bag,This bag is great for anyone who is just starting photography or just has a DSLR and wants a safe place to keep it. It easily holds my T3 and 2 lens or 1 lens and a flash. the little pockets are nice for spare SD cards or the data cable. Over all this is definitively worth the money.
5,I LOVE IT......,"I use this bag for my external light, camera and two lenses not counting the extra batteries and two wall chargers that all fit nicely. I think it's a great bag for the size and what it can hold but again I'm not a professional....."
3,This video is fine,"I ordered several new videos and I have to say I haven't repeated this one. It's simply not as challenging as Cardio Kickboxing, which has become my new favorite."
4,Really Great Workout!,I had bought this after enjoying the first Breathless Body and have found it to be a really great cardio workout when I cannot run. The workout is tough but great for different levels of fitness. I would definitely recommend it.
5,Great tractor and seller,"The product is exactly what I was looking for and although there was a problem with delivery (not sellers fault), the seller credited our account part of price. Great experience!"
4,john D. wagon,"The wagon was more difficult to assemble than it appears, then the wheels didn't turn well. But overall it is a wagon and it serves its purpose well, as well as looking good while doing it."
1,Not happy with Paint quality,"I bought this wagon to take in my RV to pull my water tank back and forth. While it does this well with the longer adult handle, my problem is with the paint. It was out in a rain and the paint blistered and started coming off in pieces as big as my palm. While I didn't expect it to stay all nice and shinny, I did expect the paint to withstand a rain or two. Wagon works great for what I bought it for,but now I had to steel brush the inside and spray paint. I estamate 80% of the paint on the inside of the wagon just flaked off."
4,beautiful short stories,"Everyone in my family enjoys the stories in this book. Two of the stories (Mother Holle and The Old Woman who was not afraid) we had heard from other story collections. This collection is interesting because it combines stories from east and west while most collections are from a specific region.I especially like the first story about a midwife, because it portrays the gift patience and understanding of the profession. There is also a story about a lady on the moon, since reading this story we no longer just look for the 'man on the moon' in our moon gazing, my daughters and I look for the `lady on the moon' as well.All in all this is an expensive book for only 8 stories. However we've gotten a lot of use out of it and I'll keep it to read to my grandchildren as well."
3,Mediocre tales...,"I love stories about wise old women--the kind who are brave and as clever as they are caring. I was hoping this would be a book full of stories of such women, but I was disappointed. Only half of the tales featured a wise old woman as a main character, and although they were well-told, none of the stories were very compelling. As a collection, this book seemed to lack focus due to poorly chosen tales.However, one element in this book is outstanding. A mural-of-sorts runs along the bottom of each page--a different mural for each tale. These murals tell the tale in minature and are a joy to explore. I found myself skipping ahead just to see what each new mural would be. This unique feature makes this book worth a look."
2,Not what I expected,This book is a compilation of questions from parents that are answered by Dr. Dobson. While I enjoyed Dobson's answers I was hoping for more of a reference guide. Each parents question is unique to their current issue. There is not a broad topic with ideas on how to handle it.
1,Disappointed reader,"This is the worst 'How To' book I have ever read...The author never makes a definitive statement about anything. Instead he says you could do this or that, hire someone or do it yourself, blah blah blah. He rambles on about the same subjects repetitively to fill up the pages. I feel like I have not learned anything of any use after reading the entire book. What a major disappointment!"
4,great start,"Woodson doesn't tell the reader how to survey, do his/her own drawings, tell how to design a curb and gutter system. I didn't expect him to! He does walk you through how to get started on the path to be a land developer, including who and/or where to go for the details you will need to get further information, as well as the long list of subjects and details the potential developer needs to consider and explore."
1,A waste of money,"Elementary discussion of land development. Lacks detail and interest.the accompanying ""checklists and forms"" are not in a format that can be manipulated. Nothing is in Word as the description suggests, all in PDF format. Not useful at all."
4,land developer,This book explains a lot about a very difficult subject. I would have liked some info about easements. I would recommend this book to those interested in this field
1,be a successful residential land developer,this book is full of nothing but common knowledge and fluff absolutely no gems of info that are remotely helpful a complete waste of money and time.
5,Good,"I guess I just didn't read it correctly, but I received 2 box sets... haha. But the quality was really good, and I wouldn't have returned it even if I didn't need it. :P"
5,"Beautiful stone, Beautiful pendant","This pendant is truly one of a kind and accents the charoite stone very nicely. The charoite stone is a little different than what I've been seeing lately with the deep black markings, but still very beautiful. I was afraid upon ordering that it might be heavy (I do not like heavy pendants) but it isn't at all and goes nicely on a light sterling chain. This pendant also goes very well with the Charoite earrings available from Ian & Valerie on Amzon which I ordered as well to hopefully be a nice match (and they are)."
3,Great,"Pen works as expected. Though i do not know how long it would last., so you would have to have at least two or three on hand if you are vending with high cash flow."
5,:),WORKS VERY WELL. I USE THIS AT WORK AND I HAVENT HAD ANY PROBLEM YET. WORKS WELL. I GOT THIS FOR AN EVENT I WAS SUPPOSE TO BE AT BUT WILL BE USING IT FOR THE UP COMING YEARS AS WELL.
5,It works,"According to product manual, ""yellow"" mark means ""real money"", and that what it shows for all the bills I tested. Great for the money."
3,Good for my personal use,"I have nothing to compare this to, but it worked fine for the large bills I wanted to check. It looks a little dried out but I am not sure if this is normal. I guess I will find out how long it will last."
1,can not trust,"brend new, out of the package shows the same on the paper or real money. i just can not trust it."
2,Does it work?,"This pen may do what it advertises. But, at my first attempt to use it, the tip slid into the barrel and was impossible to retrieve. It has been awhile since this all happened, so maybe they have solved the problem. When I saw that this pen was still being marketed I decided to write this review. The pen is less expensive now. Maybe I'll give it another try. I gave the product 2 stars instead of one in consideration that even good products have a failure now and then."
3,Thin tip.,"Pen is a standard detector, only to help you make a wise decision, but i have come across bills that looked absolutely suspicious (thin and light as a wafer) and yet passed the pen test. Use these detector pens at your own discretion. The tip is thin, not like like fat sharpie tips, much thinner. It works, unless you have an advanced counterfeit bill that can pass the test."
5,Does what it should,"This product does what it says. I don't have any complaints about it, though I did write on a cardboard box with it the other day (didn't have any other pens) and it stayed yellow, which I thought was sort of contrary to the point... Still, I've not had an issue with it since I got it."
5,Great product!,This battery charger is bought form Eforcity. It's very comfomatable for my family. Since we have 3 different digital cameras and this battery cahrger can fit all battery. It is very useful and charger is short.
4,Great detail,"Overall, beautiful cuff bracelet. Bought it for my sister as a gift. The only drawback is the thickness of the bracelet. It was very detailed in the design, but lacking in durability due to thinness."
3,Driver side mirror,I didn't open the package but the mirror seemed the correct size but it was for the driver's side and I needed one for the passenger side and they are not interchangable.Dorman 51697 LOOK! Plain Mirror Replacement Glass - is for Driver side mirror
2,Disney Princesses Wall Border Sticker,"I would not recommend this item. It does install easily, but within about 1 wk, it started to come down off the wall. I've had to continually put tape on it to hold it up. I will probably just take it down."
3,Just don't move them around,These are LARGE and very pretty for a girl's room but if you happen to want to pull them off and move them -- don't. The adhesive on the back won't stand up to reuse and the princesses kept falling off the wall.
3,Instructions,This is a great product but read the following carefully. This product goes up very easily but will not work on textured walls. Just like regular wall paper this will peel away. I have textured walls and installed the border with removable adhesive putty (sticky tac for walls). Just a little every few inches and it holds up great. Again this is for textured walls. If you walls are not textured then it should work wonderfully.
2,Its a little small,I dont check the size it was my fault but still is to little to apreciate all the princes.!!!
1,Water filters for our coffee maker.,these are the only water filters that fit our coffee maker so we have to buy them. They cost too much! I'm looking forward to my coffee maker breaking down so that I can buy another one that doesn't require these filters
3,It does what it's supposed to do.,"As with most custom water filters, this one is expensive. Basically, it's the same marketing strategy as for printer cartridges. The printer is cheap; the ink will kill you."
1,KF550 filter?,"Is this the filter for the braun KF550? Who knows? Amazon sure doesn't seem to. The virtually worthless Braun product manual doesn't say either. Why is it that Amazon concerns itself with recommending to me music based on what I bought in March 1999, but can't be bothered to recommend to me an expendable filter for the coffee pot I bought in February 2005?"
5,best coffee maker needs these,Dont forget to replace your filter! The best coffee maker ever needs these to keep the coffee so yummy
2,I was disappointed thus far.,My experience thus far with this purchase has disappointed me. I was already charged for the item; then it had to be back-ordered and I was sent an email saying my card would be charged at that time. I have since sent two emails on this subject and have been ignored; in all fairness to them; it is not 5/31 yet and the situation may be rectified; I hope it is. I have found my other experiences on Amazon to be pleasant.
3,More expensive than advertised!,"I think Amazon has a bug with their site-- this product is supposed to be $9.99 for two filters from BDI, but when I added it to my cart, I had two filters from Ace Digital Club for $15.65! The list price is $12.00, so you're better off going elsewhere.Amazon-- if I could find a ""contact us"" link, I would have written you that way, but I think you review this as well. If you correct this problem, don't bother posting this, of course!"
1,3rd party sellers are taking advantage,$65/pair is a really ridiculous price for this item. Looks like Eleven Adar and a few other unscrupulous 3rd party merchants are taking advantage of the limited availability for these filters.
4,Braun Brita Water Filters,"I didn't compare prices anywhere, but I think it should be a reasonable price for mail order. I received a Braun coffee maker as a gift and it uses these filters. Better coffee with filtered water!"
3,Stock looked somewhat shop-worn,"These filters for my Braun coffee maker appear to be brand new. They fit properly and seem to work. Shipping was prompt. The only downside was the shop-worn appearance of the package in which they were sealed. It looked as though it had been used as the ball in a touch football game, crinkled and scuffed to the point at which I would not have bought it off a retail shelf. The packaging was still sealed, though, and the product appears to be OK, but I would have expected a heftier discount considering the condition in which the merchandise was when it was delivered."
4,braun water filters,Great price on a very hard to find item- I'd looked everywhere. One box was smashed but contents were ok
1,Price is outrageous,"A year ago Amazon had 2-packs of these filters for $9.99 which is fair and reasonable. Now, I see prices for the same at over $65! The chances of buying another Braun product of any kind are zero and none. To be fair the coffeepot is great; I'd give it 5 stars but the rip-off on the filters is ridiculous, hence the one star rating."
4,What I needed!,I needed a replacement filter for a coffee pot and found it here. Good price and fair shipping and was pleased.
5,Braun Water Filter,"Reorder of an item that came with the coffemaker. Much more convenient than paper filters, and I believe, superior taste."
3,Braun filter,Never again will I purchase a coffee maker which forces one to by filters which cost so much and are hard to find...
5,Better coffee,Our home water quality was decreasing so I decided we needed to use the coffee filters that came with our Braun coffeemaker. I believe they are worth the costs to us for better tasting coffee.
4,Braun Brita Filter,Perfect fit for our Braun Coffee Maker. So happy to find this product on Amazon since we could not find it in our local stores.
3,"Good filter, poor system","The Brita filters for the Braun coffee pot do a nice job of filtering the water. They are packaged with illustrated, simple instructions on how to install the filter in the water receptacle of the appliance.I have three concerns about this filteration system being in the coffee pot:1) On one occasion the filter was wedged so tightly in its slot that it took a tool to dislodge it in order to change out the used filter. We may have installed it too tightly but this could happen easily following the minimal directions on the filter package.2) Often mold grows along the sides of the water receptacle. This has never been the case with any coffee pot I have owned prior to this one.3) The filters are only available online. They are no longer in any local stores."
3,Did not notice a big difference,"I guess where I live the water quality is not that bad since I have tried two of these water filters and have not noticed a big difference. I am able to drink the tap water where I live, but I have noticed a slightly crisper taste in bottled water. Other than that I would say just use spring water to make your coffee."
1,price error?!?!,Please explain price increase for this item. Two filters (total of four months usage) cost more than the coffee maker. I paid about $14 last summer. Now the price is $65???Braun Brita Patented KWF 2 Water Filter (2-Pack)
3,Too Expensive,These are expensive and I don't really taste a difference in my coffee. It fits perfectly in the coffee maker though.
4,"Greatly improves coffee flavors, not required","We have not used these consistently in our Braun KF500 AromaSelect coffee maker, as they are not required for the coffee maker to function. However, when installed, these dramatically improve the flavor of the coffee. For exceptional coffee flavor, run your water through a primary filter, such as a Brita pitcher, then pour it in he coffee maker. One note, do not use cold water. Hot water is ill-advised, as these filter do not work well with hot water, but cold water can cause your coffee to not fully release its flavor. Slightly warm water works best."
4,Are these really necessary?!,"I like the idea of filtered water but due to the ongoing expense, we've quit using these filters altogether in our Braun coffee maker. And we're still alive!"
5,Brita filter,We brew 2 pots a day (12 cups total). We changed the filter after 2 1/2 months. My wife claims that the improvement was quite noticeable.
5,Expensive but worth it,"I love my morning coffee because of these little babies. Our water is rock-hard and these keep our coffee maker running like new. Expensive but worth it, in my opinion."
4,Review,"Simle unique design. Takes some practice to get it aligned to the can, but one done, it does a great job opening the can w/o the usual sharp edges."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Another part of Sutcliff's Arthurian work.This one takes a look at a less romanticised version of the Arthurian legend. As others have done, here the character that represents Arthur is a war chieftain, no magic swords, or fairy ladies that can breathe underwater, just the dark hard life of a warrior and those around him."
3,Disappointing,"I loved another book by Sutcliffe but this one disappoints. The doom and foreshadowing is so relentlessly drummed in that I could never begin to care about the characters. The subtlety that she is skilled at is overdone here, and the heart of it seems hollow. Battle scenes roll by, in extravagant detail; crucial personal scenes flit past in a couple of sentences. Artos' wife is hard to love and rarely seen.It seems like Sutcliffe was desperate to avoid the overdone, often covered traditional plot elements of the King Arthur story. She keeps only the doom and very little of the honor or love."
2,Dissapointed,I read 258 of 495 pages.The endless run on over descriptive sentences were relentless.I fell on my sword to end the misery.
2,unexpected intimate descriptions,"We have enjoyed several historical books by Rosemary Sutcliff, so were a bit jolted by scenes and thoughts that seem inappropriate and unnecessary. If certain events are deemed critical to the telling of the story, perhaps they can be conveyed in a more circumspect description. Those who have experienced sexual intimacy will understand well enough. Those who have not could be spared, such as teenagers whose don't need to be thinking about such things until they are married."
2,Not for me,I did not like this book. Far too much fighting and not enough about relationships. I would not recommend this book.
3,Not the Adventure I'd Hoped For,"As a huge fan of Rosemary Sutcliff's since childhood, I found this novel somewhat disappointing. It's slow, for one; nearly halfway through the book, Artos is still assembling horses for his men and skirmishing with Saxons. Much of the action proceeds through battle scenes alternated with narratives of alliances made and treaties broken. The characters are well-drawn, but in typical Sutcliff fashion remain somewhat mysterious to the reader, right to the end. I loved the setting in post-Roman Britain; the historical details are just right, the writing stark and powerful as always. But the action takes a long time to develop, and the characters we're used to in the Arthurian saga are quite different in this version (though admittedly closer to what they might have been like before the legend developed). If you're looking for Camelot, look elsewhere; but if you enjoy gritty tales of tough (male) heroes and detailed accounts of battles and strategy, this is for you."
3,Recreational Reading,"Although it is a trifle overwritten, this is an interesting fictional tour of an ancient world and its people, animals, customs, scenery and beliefs. Good recreational reading and good for reading on the Kindle at the doctor's office."
4,Went hack and read it again as soon as I finished it,"While this book takes a more historical view of the Author legend, it manages to stay engaging and interesting. A nit hard to keep track of all the different characters at times, which is why I wanted to read it again almost immediately as the second time reading was richer."
3,Sword at Sunset,Sword at Sunset. Interesting but not too exciting. The old English spellings are tough to translate and there is just too much scenery descritions.
5,One of my favorites!,"I first read this book many years ago when it was first published in book form. I was pleased indeed to see it offered in Kindle format and available once again. Basically, it is a retelling of the Arthurian legend, but in a historical context that makes it in all respects believable. You find yourself thinking, ""it might really have happened this way, and the story of Arthur and Camelot might be true after all."" It is indeed a classic, and I highly recommend it."
1,REFILLS,"THE REFILLS COST MORE THAT THE ENTIRE PEN ITSELF! WHAT'S THE POINT?uni-ball Gel Impact RT Retractable Bold Point Blue Ink Pen Refills, 2 Pack (65874PP)"
4,Very good quality,"They are very good ones, no complaints at all about the refills. I gave it 4 star simply because they sent me the wrong color."
3,Could not find pens - refills will do.,As the pens longer seem to be available - being able to get the refills was just as good for me. Just love a BOLD MEDIUM INK - finally found it.
4,Tinder? Yes. Fire? Kind of.,"The release of a new Tindersticks album is always a good sign. They break scant new ground on this release and the disc is relatively short in running length. I think that the biggest problem in reviewing music can be that the artist is cursed if they don't try something new and it's easy to condemn them if they just trot out more of the same. 'Can Our Love.....' lacks the sheen of their last effort ['Simple Pleasure'] but also some of the grit from their earlier work, particularily their sophomore album. Tindersticks fans, buy it, you know that you want to. One cavet. There is a slightly more expensive 'deluxe' version available as an import. The only difference is a cardboard gatefold sleeve. No bonus tracks, lyrics, photos, extras, etc. The gatefold would work great on vinyl but as cd packaging it doesn't seem to justify being called a 'limited edition.'"
1,Do You Ever Get The Impression....,".... that some reviewers gush about a particular artist or band simply because their previous works were so good that this one must be too? As if it would be sheer sacrilege to question anything they put out because the reviewer could not bear to admit to themselves that their most-revered band could churn out something C grade?Well folks, compared to ""Curtains"" or ""II"" this is lame, boring. Yes, I tried to find something to like about it but in the end there is nothing! and it found it's way into the 2nd hand section of a Sydney Record store. Its probably worth 2 stars but as always on these reviews, the ratings are too heavily weighted by ""pro"" voices, so I offer a one star in the interest of balance :)"
4,Works better than most,I've bought two of these - they work reasonably well for my purposes which is listening discussion programs downloaded to my mp3 player. My only complaint is that there is a very faint high-pitched tone that is produced on one of my transmitters (but not the other!). I've tried yet another transmitter that runs on just battery and it doesn't work nearly as well.
1,Works great (but only for a couple of times)!,"I used this a couple of times and decided to go with the Griffin Roadtrip because it also charged the ipod. After deciding that the Roadtrip was a bit of a pain, I went to plug this unit back in (after not having been used for a month or two) and it was dead. I thought it might be my lighter outlet but I plugged other things into it and it worked and I tried it in my girlfriend's car and nothing. Save your money, it's useless."
4,Wild at heart,"Just what you need before embarking on a stag weekend, or a friday night out with the lads.... Very inspiring stuff!!!"
1,Wild Girls tame,"I had heard good things about ""Wild Girls: Thailand"". They were not true. The cd contains lots of topless women splashing about in the water. Period. Boooring! Not sexy, not even full nudity for the most part. Feeble, amateurish effort. Save your money."
1,Not what you think,"This video recieved many good reviews, they must have been from the producers attempting to get people to purchase it. It is not at all like the girls gone wild videos - some of the girls are attractive, but very few of them and the video is booring!"
2,Not quite the worst movie ever made.,"But you'll have a hard time distinguishing.Overwrought, overwordy, overdramatized, and understoried. If you like watching Ray Winstone sweat, and Ian McShanelook smug, and listening to John Hurt scream the ""C"" word over and over again through a bad pair of dentures thenyou will love this thing. I've read reviews claiming this movie is ""smart, witty, subtly funny, blah blah blah."" Horsehockey!This movie is neither funny, nor witty, nor is it ""smart"", it just plain sucks, and its painful to watch. Very painful.And for all you so called ""fans"" of Ian McShane.....COME ON! Ian Friggin McShane????2 Punches (in the nose), and I'm being kind."
4,DVD Film,Received this in a timely fashion. Well packaged. Couldn't have asked for better. Also a pretty decent film. I am pleased.
2,"VIAGRA, please","A bit boring screening is of males in their near-menopause-age (or?) assisting a mate to avenge wife's adultery with a son-aged capable and willing French barman by encouraging him to be murdered.Strange mates, stupid fat husband and bitchy wife with advances to all the company as disclosed.No drama."
3,"First great lines...""I can't believe it!"" ""It's unbelievable!""","Second great lines - Winstone: ""I feel lost. I don't know where I am."" Dillane: ""I've been there."" Howlingly funny for the first half...falters and dies thereafter. Darn. I wanted it to be great all the way through, but there it is. It turns stagey and stodgy after a gripping, hilarious start. All the actors are great, though. Winstone is a debauched thug and crybaby; Hurt is a disgusting, criminal geezer; Wilkinson is a degenerate mama's boy (how does he know his mother rolled out of bed onto the floor unless he was sleeping with her?); Dillane is a fading sleaze who's too stupid to be the insouciant, louche charmer he's trying to be, and McShane is beyond brilliant as an arrogant, unrepentant homosexual who fancies himself far above his ""pals."" I could stare at the screen with these guys on it for days, but it just doesn't live up to its original glory. Still, those two bits of dialogue were worth it."
3,Boring...,"I remember when Dennis Miller was asked on a talk show what he thought about the lengthy movie, The English Patient. He said, ""When I finally got out of the theater and the sunlight hit my eyes, I asked, 'Is Clinton still president?'"" The only difference between that movie and this one is that it's shorter, thank God. But I think the full measure of boredom was compacted into the 98 minutes... How bored can one get? Tears? I feel sleepy... My eyes-lids are getting heavy...I was expecting Taken or Edge of Darkness or even Harry Brown. That's not what I got. I know that now. Who knew? The DVD cover said, ""The measure of revenge."" The star is pictured holding a baseball bat in front of a guy tied to a chair. I'm not a lawyer, but 'talk about gross misrepresentation...I know I sound like a heathen, but watch this movie for yourself, if you dare. Then write your own review."
2,I've seen worse but not many,Lot of other things I could've done with the time I wasted sitting through this movie. Good actors but the story line just never went anywhere.
1,Boring. Every other word is the f word or the c word.,Most of the movie is just dialogue from a bunch of filthy mouthed old geezers who sound like they are all talking with a mouth full of mashed potatoes. What is the cause of that? Is even the skin and fat in their mouths and throats saggy and flabby?Every other word out of their mouths is either the c word or the f word. Is that supposed to make them cool?The movie is boring. The dialogue is boring. It looks like it was made with a budget of about $500. How much does it cost to rent a beat up old van and a room in the basement of a crack house?This movie reads like an old man's fantasy about beating up his wife and emasculating a younger man. What a pathetic way to try to reclaim your long lost virility.
3,44 Inch Chest,"This movie was to say the most, mildly entertaining. The acting was impressive, the plot was not fulfilling in the slightest. If it is available to watch online, do that instead of purchasing first. I own it purely for my love of Ian McShane and all is wildly different roles."
1,Seller should change his description,"I thought this item was too good to be true. The description says it is a 12 pack. It even lists the original price of $38.49 which would be the price of a dozen pens. Wow, I thought 12 of one of the best pens made for only $2.44. A little hard to believe, but I jumped at the opportunity to buy them at this price, even though the shipping was rather high. As it turned out, I only received 1 pen, not a box of pens. What a disappointment. The seller needs to make the description clear that the price is for only 1 pen!"
5,Great Pen,I am a teacher and these are great pens! They flow easy and do not make your hand cramp when doing a lot of writting.
3,John Truscott Rides Again,"Staffed with Aishling Morgan's usual cast of anally obsessed women, dwarfs, upper-middle-class twits, elderly husbands and John Truscott; Demonic Congress leaves the reader dissatisfied. This book lacks much by way of dramatic tension and Morgan appears to have lost interest in the sort of lurid details which make ""The Old Perversity Shop"" a winner. Not so much a loser as a case of Morgan mailing it in."
1,selling broken items?,"I realize that I bought this product at a very low price, but I wasn't aware that it was broken."
5,This is a Fabulous Collection of Children's Music,"We had This Little Cow on tape when my children were little, and it was a huge favorite! We listened to it in the car on driving trips and the sing-alongs were epic. Now that they're grown up, I'm buying the CD for my grandchildren to enjoy. I am so excited to have found it again! Janon"
3,Good for kids,"My kids (5&3) use this for nightlights. It's perfect b/c conventional flashlights get left on all night then need new batteries every few days. But this one can be used as needed and has a wrist band for keeping it handy. I agree w/the other reviewer that it doesn't hold a charge great - it's better than 30 seconds, esp. if you squeeze it a bit, but I wouldn't use it for a work light."
2,Battery less flashlight,You have to keep squeezing Flashlight to have light. It will not sustain light for more than 30 seconds. You cannot use it to do any hands on work due to the jerkiness caused by squeezing it.
3,Must read for military history buffs,"As a civil affairs officer, the exploits of the 23rd remind me a lot of the civil affairs relationship with the Army...vitally important to the mission but mostly misunderstood and under appreciated. Book gives great summaries of the operational details. Would have liked to have known more about the men of the 23rd especially the citizen soldiers with unique skills for the special effects and atmospherics. Nonetheless, I recommend this book to anyone who is curious about this subject."
2,Beginner's method?,"It's an alright video, but a little to quick paced for someone coming into it with no idea or experience."
2,"Good Instruction, Awkward Form","I liked how clearly she described and demonstrated the movements, but I found her version of the form to be awkward and stilted rather than demonstrating the graceful and free-flowing movements I used to see performed each morning in the parks near our city's Chinatown.The hand movements are odd and I find it hard to relate them to the martial-arts foundation of tai chi (e.g., other instructors leave the palm facing the opponent for an obvious strike, whereas this tape has you looking as if you just are going to poke their eyes or making a bird's beak--the flow of movements make more sense when you know what the base is rather than remembering by rote the next step is ""holding a teabag""). The body movements are also overly restrained in scope--you don't really stretch out for the strike--you seem to stay folded over on yourself.Again, I found her detailed instructions very clear, but I just do not want to practice this hunched-over, constrained form."
2,Arggghhh! TOO SLOW - Drove me crazy!...,"I'm sorry to say this video drove me absolutely nuts! Maybe it's just me, but I think an exercise video should have you MOVE at some point. This lady just talks and talks and talks! This is probably great for someone who is starting at step one, but for anyone with ANY experience at all, this is BORING! I'm going to sell this copy and look for one that is a little more advanced...."
1,Avoid!,"I wanted to try a new kind of fitness video besides the typical over-choreographed step workout. I bought this tape. The first time I used it I found myself wondering when the ""exercise program"" mentioned on the back cover was going to start. Whoever called Hooton an ""old bag"" was right on the money. She didn't have a whole lot of energy and was a very bland leader. I had never tried t'ai chi before, but thanks to this video I never will again. Buy something to use for an exercise program, just don't buy this!"
1,Taiji for Fossils,"Claire Hooton is such an old bag,she can barely move herself.Her shoulders are hunched and she seems not to be even bending her knees on some of the postures.And she says men are bound up!Her hands are way too dead and limp and her form shows no spirit whatsoever.She seems to be just barely able to gothrough the motions.A horrible, uninspiring video,steer clear!"
1,Pass on this one,This was the first exercise tape I ever bought that was so bad I couldn't even finish it. The instructor is about 100 years old and not someone who in any way inspires you. At times she hesistates and seems unsure of how she wants to teach. Not exactly encouraging. The background set consists of cheap props that detract from the lesson. The people who demonstrate many of the moves look like they were snatched from a studio audience. This is NOT the tape to buy if you want to learn Tai Chi. I can't believe the producers are offering this to the general public.
1,Not Worth It,"If had had to do it all over again I would choose a diferent video to start with. Ms. Hooton gives he fundamentals od Tai Chi, but does not present any warm-up or streching exercises before you begin the form. I have taken some Tai Chi classes so I already know many of the movements, but I still find it the movements hard to follow, even with ""reverse view"".For the beginner I would try another video and carefully read the reviews before making a purchase."
4,Good starter video for complete beginners,"I bought this video for my mother and I believe it will be a good tool for her to begin learning Tai Chi. It is not fancy but the price is reasonable and the instruction is coherent. Claire Hooten gives background information on Tai Chi and speaks of the 6 principles (posture, relaxation, etc) at the start. After you watch it once you'll want to fast forward to the 30 minute mark for practicing the movements. She demonstrates the entire short form (first 20 postures) once through then breaks them down in groups of 3 or 4 and gives the instruction twice. The first is just her from the front and the second adds two students who perform with their backs to you for the ""EZ learning reverse view"". Claire's verbal instructions are excellent - they provide good body cues and a visual imagery. The video ends with a complete run through of the short form in the ""reverse view""."
5,Excellent description of each move in the sequence,"When I bought this tape to learn tai chi, I was somewhat familar with the exercise form. Claire does an excellent job of describing each of the moves. You also get the advantage of seeing the front and the back to help you follow along. This is the tape I would recommend to some one who wants to learn tai chi."
1,Keep Browsing,"After one session with this video I went back to my other one (Tai Chi for Health, the LifeStyle version) and this one has never seen the inside of my VCR again. I found both Hooton's teaching style and her hunched-over posture while demonstrating the moves off-putting and uninspiring. She looks like she has a spinal deformity when she moves through the postures, and I'd rather not learn that particular ""style,"" although it might appeal to others. My recommendation is to check it out of the library or find a friend who has a copy, and try before you buy."
3,it is not that bad,"The other person who wrote a review saw only the negative, but it isn't that bad really. When you go to a studio, they often first show you face to face the moves (you have to do correction) and then the reverse and that is exactly what Claire Hooton is doing. So why complain? I found the DVD quite helpful, it made me feel like I am with the teacher in one room."
5,"Quite simply, the voice of God for today!",This is Tozer at his best ... and if you know Tozer you know what that means! An absolutely heart-piercing message delivered clearly and simply. Do not miss this; it is one of my favorite messages and is as radical and timely now as when it was first uttered nearly 50 years ago!
1,Tremenda Porqueria,Estaba muy decepcionado por este album...quisas 2 buenas cansiones pero...mas na'no hay palabras para describir que mal estuvo este album
3,Elders help,"This helps when a person wants to remember the basic way to love and share with one another. It is about respect and sharing and accepting one another on motherearth. It would be a good book for our children, to remember the way it was. It would help for us to remember the old ways and yet be able to walk in the world as it is today, using the words of the elders from this great land."
4,A Manual On Method In African History,"This slim volume is more than just a survey of the East African coast. It is actually the foremost text on the methods and sources available for understanding the continent's remote past. With the Swahili as a test case, Nurse and Spear discuss the major categories of primary sources, along with sound methods for using them. Their findings support the scholarly consensus about the coast: despite significant external contacts, notably from the Indian Ocean, the Swahili (both language and people) are fundamentally African in origin and character. Linguistic data gets special attention, but those sections are less scary than they first appear, since the authors generally succeed in clarifying this complex material and its role in reconstructing African history. T. Spear, ""Kenya's Past"" achieves the same goal for a whole country, and with greater time depth. But since that work is OP, ""The Swahili"" is a good option."
2,unnecessarily incomprehensible academese,"Some academics think that if they write something simply, readers will not take them seriously. Pity the poor students who must memorize the writings. The book is incomprehensible in countless ways. It mixes up time periods, assumes that everyone knows the location of small towns in east Africa, has no maps and only a few completely inadequate sketches. It offers no explanation for basic concepts like the Sabaki languages, and so on. I ordered one to give one as a present, and I returned it."
2,The Swahili,"The Swahili, by Thomas Spear and Derek Nurse, is a very boring book with extraneous amounts of unnecessary detail. Though the book contains adequate information dealing with the African Swahili, it will not catch any reader's eye, unless they are forced at gunpoint to read it. Sentences like, ""The distinction between Mwani-Mgao and the others farther north suggests that the earliest settlement may have been at an intermediate location, such as Kilwa."" There are just so many different tribes and the authors make it difficult to distinguish between them. The Swahili focuses on the lives of the African dwellers of the eastern coast of Africa. The book gives good information about the lives of the Swahili, but the information is not positioned right. The authors make it difficult to understand some crucial points at times."
4,Great Buy,"Easily inflatable, and works great. Make sure 24"" is what you need, it's not as big as I thought it would be, but is sufficient."
4,Martin Lawrence Season #3,"The dvd was still in wrap and of good quality but I did notice that part of the way the voices didnt match with their lip movements...Kind of dissapointed, but overall a good dvd to purchase."
1,Definately do not recommend.,"I cannot keep the sleeves in the wallet, I've tried taking it in my car and now my cd's end up all over the car floor. I've picked them up and they are in my glove box, you cannot turn the pages without them falling out. The only good thing I can say about this item is that it does have a soft back on the item so that the Cd's won't scratch. Otherwise, don't bother."
2,Cute but small!,Bought several cookie cutters for my sister's baby shower. I wanted to give friends and family a more personal gift bag. This cookie cutter was not that easy to use and decorate. It got stuck in the cookie dough.
5,GOOD books,"I say read it!! yes it could habe been better, but it's good anough for me!!! I hope they come out with more Juvenile orion books. Over all I think the 5th book rocked. :-D"
2,Can someone explain why a refill should cost more than the actual pen did???,"OK, I love these pens. LOVE them.But, they do run out unbelievably quickly, and after throwing out the bazillionth pen this afternoon, I remembered that they were refillable. So, I came, hoping to just buy a good supply of refills, and learned that the refills cost more than the actual pens.Needless to say, I'll be buying the pens instead.Way to be environmentally conscious, Uni-ball. :-( Might I suggest that (a) you find some way of putting larger reservoirs into these wonderful pens, and (b) that you revise your pricing structure to account for the fact that YOU are saving the trouble and expense of manufacturing pens, when you sell a refill instead?Thanks."
2,Disappointing ink,"I purchased the uni-ball Gel Bold Point Pen Ink Refill and did not get much use out of the first one. It lasted maybe 2 weeks (and I work on a computer so I don't write much besides lists). It started skipping like it was out of ink, and then stopped working completely. I'm really disappointed in this, and I hope it was a fluke and I actually get some use out of the second one."
2,Cheap price for the car charger... ONLY,"I bought two of these packages almost three months ago. One of the car chargers was DOA. The two carrying cases were completely different, even thought the packaging was the same. One was simply a holster (which was my favorite design) and only lasted about two months before the plastic ""pocket"" pulled away from the leather. The second design was a fold-over cover, but it is such a tight fit that the phone won't stay closed as the cover 'pulls' it back open. The ear pieces are cheap and uncomfortable. For $10, it may be worth you while to see if the car charger works...."
1,Poor quality recharger,"I should have headed earlier reviews and warnings about this product. The charger is indeed inferior. It requires hairline precision to stay in the charging position since it is not a tight fit. If it moves the slightest bit it stops charging. And since the cord is very short, when you try to set it on the seat or dash, it almost always goes out of alignment. In fact, you pretty much have to hold it in your hand for it to work. I ordered one for my girlfriend and hers has the same problem so I know it's not a fluke. The case is fairly useless as well - I have not tried the headset as I have one already and bought this package just for the charger. A bad decision and thought it's considerably more expensive - should have purchased the one that came with the phone from Verizon."
1,Three-Piece Value Combo,Horrible. The only thing that is useful is the car charger. Ear piece for hands free phone use doesn't work and the leather phone case does not fit at all. I guess you get what you pay for. Lesson learned! :)
2,Broken,"I had been using this lotion warmer/dispenser for about six months when it broke. The heating element still works, but the pump no longer produces lotion when pushed, rendering it useless.Also, before it was broken, it was necessary to fill the well nearly full in order to get any lotion out, which meant refilling it nearly every week.I don't recommend it."
1,Woud Not Recommend,"The idea was great and I did enjoy the warm lotion,however I used it three times and put it back in the box. The on/off switch is located on the top of the dispenser and each and every time I turned it off lotion squirted everywhere making a huge mess and if you leave it on all the time the lotion gets hard and dries out. Would love to recommend it but I just can't. I use lotion a couple of times a day due to dry skin and thought this would be a great item for me it just didnt measure up."
5,Canon Bag,"This is a great bag. It fits my video, still, and all accessories used for capturing all the special moments. I like the adjustable sections of the bag."
3,great but dissappointing,"everything that this game does have is pure worms greatness. It's a beautiful interface, and its smooth and nice to play with. However, it is lacking in almost every aspect. The arsenal is laughable at something ridiculous like fourteen weapons! have the fun was having a bazillion weapons. Also, there are very few different levels, accents, customizations, play modes, the music is repetative... overall a dissappointment. If you love the worms games you'll probably like this one, but like me you'll probably be suprised by how little stuff there is in it. Worms was fun because of the minute detail you could tweak and play with. This just misses that mark. Bottom line, I know they could do more with a PSP game, and I wouldn't buy it unless it was ten bucks or under."
4,"Worms, allways cool","This game is awesome and really cool but as I'm used to play worms 3d it result me a little bit difficult but I saw new landscapes, dicovered new weaponds and specially kicked my enemie's butt! This game is cool!!!"
4,"Comprehensive, but not in electronic format","The Bird of Ecuador: Field Guide provides a thorough review of the birds of Ecuador. Usually, I don't like field guides where the color plates are separate from the detailed descriptions and distribution maps; however, in this book it was a blessing. As many others have done, I was able to slice out the color plates, 3-hole punch them and put in a binder that will be more useful in the field, and lighter for my luggage. I was deeply disappointed that Cornell University Press has not yet made the move to make this book available in eBook format, especially since the Cornell Lab of Ornithology has been very proactive about creating electronic tools that can be used on a smart phone or tablet."
3,The birds of eduador,This book is a beautiful artistic resource and certainly represents the huge variety of birds in Ecuador.BUT IT WEIGHS a TON!! Totally impractical as a field guide to be carried around when birding. Even though a paperback it actually weighs 4 pounds. Making it too heavy for even carrying in your baggage for international flying. I had looked forward to taking it when birding next month in Ecuador. Now I will leave it at home with great regret.
5,Bulky but a great field guide!,"Ridgely does it again, with a fantastic field guide for Ecuador. It's very bulky and difficult to carry in the field hence the oft suggestion of having just the plates bound for field use. I agree with the notion and should have done that. This guide is a must for a birding excursion to the wonderful country of Ecuador."
3,The field guide that is not a field guide,"This is an exhaustive book with brilliant drawings - but not a field guide. Forget what the publishers say about two volumes and this one being the field guide. It's hideously impractical. It's over 700 pages, thicker than your fist, and a HEAVY load to be lugging around and getting it into an out of your backpack, especially when hiking or navigating slippery jungle trails in the sweltering heat. That said, I don't know of any other field guide and let's face it, we birders need a field guide. As many others I have had the plates with the drawings taken out and bound into a 'new' book, and brought only that with me. It's suboptimal, but hey, what can you do."
4,History people should know.,I first read about David Thompson in a National Geographic magazine and I couldn't put it down. David Thompson has done more for the exploration of North America than anyone in the school history books. It is a shame that I have only met one person who has ever heard of David Thompson. Most people would be shocked to find that some of the maps used by Lewis and Clark were drawn up by this Hudson Bay Company explorer who was only in his teens. This man had an amazing life and for more great reading get a hold of his diary of travles.
4,rooted in the flow,"Jack Nisbet takes the reader on detailed journey of fur trading and exploration that offers a taste of the history of human settlement patterns in this portion (the Columbia River watershed) of the Northwest. His re-enactment of history through Thompson's journals parallels his own contemporary site explorations. The book's narratives now add to my explorations of day hiking venue, enriching the sense of place with a historical perspective."
3,Sugarland dvd,"I love Sugarland and this DvD gives a great insight into the group. Lacking in musical ear candy. If you want to hear their songs in conjunction with eye candy, this is not for you. If you would like a great video insight into the group, this DvD is fantastic. It was not clear from the description that this was more of a documentary then a music video. NOT a music video, but a very insightlful documentary. Well worth the purchase depending on your expectations."
5,Best No Sugar Added Dark Chocolate,"This is my favorite ""no sugar added"" chocolate. The flavor is rich and the almonds always taste very fresh. I have also tasted the orange dark chocolate flavor and it is also delicious. I love this product."
2,Great taste until the price increase,"I've been buying the YC Chocolate brand for many years (the milk chocolate with almonds version). In 2006 the price was $25.27 for a BOX OF 10 (web orders, but not directly from the producer, ycchocolate.com). In the past several years I could only buy directly from the producer for $29.90 (box of 10) plus a free bar for each box ordered. I've been running low lately and when I went to the usual web site, I found they were now selling for $40 per BOX OF 8!! Today I checked again and the price is now $42 for a box of 8, from ycchocolate and from amazon. Needless to say, they have lost me as a regular customer. The chocolate is among the best ""no sugar added"" chocolates (it's as good as regular chocolate), I would recommend them to anyone. But with a price increase of 78%, no way."
4,Excellent Pad,"I bought this pad for my wife for our backpacking trips because I already have one so i felt confident that it would still work well for her as well. Well, it does. It is light, backs tight (when rolled about an 8-10 inch roll). Just took a soggy trip through the rain, and the closed cell constructions is a breeze when it comes to setup time. Just shake and you are ready to go. No worries about air leaking or not expanding correctly when it is cold here. One small complaint...I wish it was a little thicker. But at an inch thick it is adequate. no won is really used to sleeping on the ground anyway."
3,Ridge Rest REG,Not as thick or padded as I expected but probably will provide extra warmth in the colder months.
2,"okay, but not the best","The idea of recognizing handwritten math is great. However, this product falls short of what it could be since math isn't recognized dynamically as it's written and it requires you (me at least) to significantly change my handwriting style for my input to be recognized correctly.A much better alternative, IMHO, is FluidMath. FluidMath has a simpler, more elegant UI that works great on a TabletPC or electronic whiteboard. There are also lots of great YouTube videos that show how to use FluidMath in the classroom."
1,DON'T order this BALLPOINT!! **READ** This is not ROLLERBALL,"If you searched for ""rollerball refill"" for Parker it leads you to this link (as of right now). The main picture on Amazon shows the real ROLLERBALL refill, but as you can carefully observe by the (current) description, picture, and typed words ABOVE this is NOT the rollerball refill but the BALLPOINT refill, which is exactly what you will get if you order this. Of course ballpoint will not fill your rollerball pen and you will be doubly grouchy that you can't use your wonderfull Parker rollerball. It's just some stupid screwup that no has bothered fixing. I told this company today and I told Amazon. Hopefully they will fix it. Please, notify Amazon if you mistakenly order this so that they will finally take it down. I have already lost money on ordering this once and almost did it again."
4,Good Product,Very good product.The pen writes well.I like a Jotter.What else can you write about a pen refill.
