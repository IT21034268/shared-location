3,So So,"Adhesives are not up to par, pieces fell off on first day after installation. Could benefit from a training video or instructions on how to encourage the dog to use it."
4,Well Built,Exactly what I needed to keep out the cold and give my Golden Retriever access to the yard whenever I am home. Works well and well built.
1,The politically correct book on the Duke,"This is the politically correct books on Duke. If you are however honestly and objectively interested in Duke, read instead his My Awakening."
3,And then theres...Everready?,"I own a couple of Tech N9NE's previous albums but compared to those this album doesn't quite cut it. Tech N9NE is probaly one of the most lyrically strongest emcees out there. I feel like this album shows that he's falling out of the image of his hardcore style and into mainstream club songs. He only has a couple songs on hear that I feel are worth a replay. The second cd I just didn't like, it was more focused on the rock then the rap and it just wasn't what I wanted to hear from Tech."
3,"There's no questioning Tech's flow, but...","Arguably the greatest to ever grace a microphone but his hooks/choruses/whatever bring the album down. I'm just not digging the girls that sing on 3/4 of his hooks. It's the same disease that plagued Canibus - weak choruses. I agree with the folk that want to hear him on a Neptune/Timbaland beat. Dre's beats are recycled garbage nowadays. Not his greatest album, iTunes Come Gangsta. But for those that can look past it, Tech N9ne's delivery/wordplay is as good as its ever been. Werd to Big Bird. 3 1/4 stars."
5,"Even my fat, lazy cat loved it!","So, I have 2 cats - a 9 year old male fat orange tabby, and a 5 year old female brown tabby. The girl is pretty playful and enjoys rolling around in catnip, the boy is more interested in just eating catnip and being lazy.I bought a Boogie Mat for each cat, and laid them out on the floor. Imagine my surprise when the boy laid down and started rolling around in ecstasy - rubbing his head all over the mat, biting the tassels, wrestling with the mat. The girl laid down and played on her mat for a bit, but lost interest and started playing with other toys. When she decided to give her mat another go, the boy started chasing her away - it seemed he had decided that both mats were now his!In summary - one cat completely adores the mats, and one cat merely likes them. Overall, I was thrilled to see my fat, lazy boy cat rolling around like a kitten again!"
5,It has won the heart of one.,"I have no idea if all of my cats will like this or not. Only because one of them won't get off of it. He wants food, he drags it with him, he wants water, he drags it with him, he wants a nap, he drops where he is at and snuggles up. So, I'm going to have to buy another just to see if anyone else likes it. So, Porkchop would like to say ""Highly Recommended""."
2,Two stars for napping: zero for playing,"I have three cats and bought two of these mats recently (it never fails: if I buy one of something they all want it, but if I buy three, they are disinterested -- cat people, I know you know what I'm saying). Anyway, all three cats are thoroughly unimpressed by the mats, and they usually enjoy good cat nip and toys. One of my cats has decided that the mats are a good sleepy place, though, so at least there is that -- although, I am sure an old towel would have impressed her just as much. :)"
4,Brilliant Loops and samples...,"Quick run down of my favorite tracks...Little black spiders (Scorpions sample), Koochy(Gary Neuman sample), Hybridz an excellent old school house track...I love it. Fly Away love: nice and smooth....with a loong intro. The samples that appear on the web site don't do the CD justice, if you like just the intros that they play you'll love the CD. Over all a very cool CD that gets a ton of play in my stereo in the car...at work...at home...every where ;^) Van Helden...that's a money name huh? Get the CD."
2,"I did like ""Necessary Evil"" though","Whatever scene this is, that scene needs to cuts its tracks in half. I like repetitive music, but only when I can put it in the background. Repetition and sandpaper don't mix and fall into the background."
2,Great... unless you want some dancable house...,"As much as Armand is trying to 'change the world' with his message, the CD as a whole is lacking the kind of classic hits that we got from him, like ""Witch Doktor"" and ""U Don't Know Me."" The samples of 80's heavy metal and the like are cool listening music, but when I bought the album I was expecting some deep house... In my opinion, the CD is simply too cluttered with meaningless samples, and the like... The songs (there are 3 or 4) that you can really dance with, are nothing but extended loops. The CD'z okay... but nothing great..."
1,Avoid,"Like some guy said below - ignore the hype and ask your shop keeper to let you actually hear it. The 'big tune' is Koochy which is the first four notes of Gary Numan's Cars repeated over and over and over again for a mind numbing 9 minutes. If it sampled a little more of Cars, it might have been ok, but... Continuing this trend is Flyaway Love, which repeats the song title for around 8 minutes and has a standard disco loop behind it. Full Moon is dire, it's very Will Smith-ish, and the the albums grand finale consists of the usual house beats with four notes over it repeated over and over until you turn it off in embarrassment (I held out for 9 minutes). I wish I could bring it back to Fish records, but that's not their policy. Genius my arse.(...)Not even Vanilla Ice's debut has sunk to the status of being worth no more than a bar of chocolate.Absolutely hilarious, poetic justice. I really am pleased."
4,Worth a look,"Good book regarding the merchant marine, the QE2 and the author's experiences in living a life at sea. There are many good stories, and the book flows quite well. However, Arnott seems to remember every meal he ever ate and spends a lot of time talking about them."
4,AweSoMe!,"Sen Dog is awesome, it's more of what was on the sencond CD of the newest Cypress Hill CD. YOU WILL ENJOY!"
5,Love my sparkles!,Love my Sparkles...this product is awesome...just lightly dust yourself after you have dressed and you will sparkle the nite away...I never leave home without it!
4,Great Shoe but Road Runner Sports Shipped Wrong Width,"I ordered the medium width from Amazon but was shipped the E width. I asked to exchange the item but Road Runner informed me that they couldn't process an exchange, only a return. In addition, they didn't reimburse me for my shipping costs to return the item (the smart label they provided couldn't be used). I love the shoe and have worn it for appx 10 years but won't be purchasing anything from Road Runner in the future due to the poor customer service."
2,Men's New Balance M878,"Since you can't return them, buying shoes online is not a good idea unless you are already familiar with the exact size and model."
1,A poor imitation of the brilliant original,"Do not delude yourselves into thinking the new 2 Unlimited are an incarnation of the original Dutch dance machine. I bought this CD and returned it the following day for a full refund. This is absolute trash, devoid of any memorable song lines or tunes. If you can find the works of the original group, I would unreservedly recommend them to you."
5,this is a gift,we havent opened our christmas presents yet . i bought it for a gift.so i dont know how the movie is yet
3,Saxophone,My grandson was a little disappointed with his new sax. We thought it could be blown like a real sax.
3,"Can't blow into this sax, just push buttons.","The mouthpiece on this sax is fake. The only way to get music is to push buttons. My grandson knows (from watching Baby Einstein) he's supposed to blow to get music, yet he blows and blows and nothing happens. Frustrating for kids."
3,Not what we wanted.,"This wasn't as fun as we had hoped. Even with the volume control it is LOUD!! My preschool will put on a brief show, but was disappointed she could only ""play"" 4 notes on her own. She can play a few songs with 4 notes. The songs it does on its own are fun to listen to - but we all got bored with the sax fast."
2,You don't actually blow into it!,"My 2 and 4 year old were so looking forward to a saxophone. They love musical instruments...""real"" ones. It's really sad, my son stands there blowing into it wondering why it won't play. What's the point? It's more like a baby toy that you push buttons to hear music...the kids got board with it in a day. Unforutnely the shipping cost to buy/return would be as much as the instrument...so we'll donate it."
5,Schizophrenic daydream beats,"Fink may hail from the trip-hop capitol of the world, but the playful mood of Fresh Produce stands in stark contrast to the grim aesthetic favored by Bristol's better-known electronic auteurs. Fink stretches the beats and pushes the groove into muscular electro territory. The results are never short of humor and groove."
5,The Current Series Can't Hold a Candle to the Original!,"""The Outer Limits,"" like ""The Twilight Zone,"" is one of those series that was too much for its time. The show was the perfect marriage of sci-fi, incredible ensemble acting for the week's guest stars, and a marvelous score for the first season from Dominic Frontiere. ""Don't Open 'Til Doomsday"" is one superb hour of television. From its unusual storyline, crisp cinematography, and flawless performances from the prinicipals, chiefly Miriam Hopkins as the long-suffering ""bride-to-be"" and movie/TV stalwart John Hoyt as an overprotective father, the episode shines from start to finish. Along with ""The Zanti Misfits,"" ""ZZZZZ,"" ""It Crawled Out of th Woodwork,"" ""The Man Who Was Never Born,"" and ""The Bellero Shield (featuring another stand-out Hoyt performance),"" this is the one that belongs in the Television Hall of Fame."
4,hard to close main tools,"my grandma bouht this for me a little while ago.Its pretty cool but it is really hard to close the main tools.Since my grandpa is a heck of alot stronger than me so he can do it with one hand.Also,my dad has the orignal Gerber multi tool.He said that if i get straight a's i get his surefire and that i get his."
4,"Durable, solid, and functional","I generally default to buying gerbers because their warranty is awesome and they're usually built tough and solid. This one is no exception. I chose the folding option (vs flicking models) because I've had flicking ones get sand and crap in them that make them not come out as smoothly. The item is heavy and solid, and everything works exactly as you'd expect it to.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the phillips head screwdriver is a little flatter than I'd like to see. What I mean by that is it's more of a flathead with two very small bumps on either side of it. It works for sharp, fresh screws without any issue, but it would clearly be useless against any screw that has begun to strip.Other than that, I'm very happy with the product, and for the price I doubt you'll find a better multi-tool."
3,Girls Perspective,Its well balanced in the hand however the locking buttons are so firm they hurt my fingertips to push and the lanyard ring took a bit to find. The pliers were made in Taiwan and the rest of the multitool was constructed out of china; I was a bit bummed to read that. The spring loaded pliers are nice - Only thing I think it is missing is a nail file and maybe a awl or gut hook would have been nice instead of scissors and the serrated knife =) Next time I think I will go with SOG because they let you customize their multitools
3,Good...... But.....,Its a good multi tool... The pliers are great... The knife and saw are ok... The one thing that was not great were the scissors. Actually sucked. I tried to cut 550 paracord and it could not cut through it. For the price it is a good multi tool but I would go for the leatherman wave ...
5,The tool for the fixer,"This was a gift for my brother in law, the mechanic. He was excited about the amount of attachments on one tool. The locking mechanisms on larger tools makes for convenient usage. It also comes with a sheath for your belt. A must have for the do it yourselfer."
3,worked well for a month,"I was very excited to get this as a gift for my husband for Christmas. After trying to use it to open a can, pieces of the knife bent back and the piece used to pull out the tools broke off. I was pretty disappointed. We are going to return the product."
4,Good first multi-tool,"I have purchased three of these so far, one for each boy when they turned 8. Its a great starter tool / knife for them since the actual blade is very short and not pointy.For the younger kids, all the tools on the multiplier are really cool and the handle looks great. However for an adult, I would say that it is a bit bulky, especially compared to a Leatherman Supertool or Wave, both of which have incredibly sharp and pointy blades."
5,Here is my overview the Gerber,"Here is my overview the Gerber Suspension Multi-tool[...]The bit adapter is mounted on the Gerber Suspension Butterfly Opening Multi-Plier, but can also be used with any Gerber Freehand, Nautilus, Diesel, Recoil Multi-Plier models, and maybe even more.Here is my overview the Gerber 22-49445 10-Piece Tool Kit[...]"
2,Poor craftsmanship,"I had a Gerber multi-plier while in the Army years ago and loved it. I lost it while camping a while back and have missed it since. I went for this Suspension because of its price and thought that since it was a Gerber it would be fine. The tool looks like it should have rejected at the factory, when closed the handles are not even and it it very hard to open. The screws that hold the tool together have burs all over them and one of them is countersunk while the rest are above the surface. The straight blade is very hard to open with the thumb stud. And the sheath is falling apart after only a week. The tool was under $30 so I guess you get what you pay for, but Gerber should be ashamed for putting their name on this."
2,New 2011 Leatherman tools totally trump this,"I originally bought this tool while looking for a multitool that incorporated a good selection of tools as well as spring-loaded pliers. Normally, I stay in the Leatherman camp, but they didn't make any full-size tools with pliers. The day I received this tool, the first thing I noticed was how fat and stubby it was, and the tools were quite short as well. I was planning on coping with it until I decided to check the Leatherman website, and lo and behold, here were new tools incorporating spring-loaded pliers! The Sidekick and Wingman both have Leatherman quality, good-size (but minimalist) tools, and spring-loaded pliers. I heavily suggest one of those two (I have the Wingman) over the Suspension I returned."
2,Loose pliers,"I'm not satisfied with the assembly of the Gerber Suspension multi-tool. The pliers has a little play even after tightening the screws. The only thing I like is the padded grip, the bottom portion where it touches the part of your hand. Nice design but does not meet my requirements. I guess I'm just hard to be pleased. This tool is made in China."
4,great for what it is,"Don't let some of these reviews saying this thing is cheap persuade yout to buy a diffent multitool. Apparantly some folks did't do their research before buying this. This is not a top of the line Leatherman or SOG. It's not even a top of the line Gerber. This is a cheaper Gerber. I bought it to use underwater and it works great for that. It also makes a good ""throw in your glove box of the Camry"" multitool. I am knocking off one point because the lock allows some play with the straight edge knife and the scissors. The play is minimal and hardly even noticible. Otherwise, great multitool."
5,"Gerber 01471 Suspension Butterfly Opening Multi-Plier, with Sheath","So far, this has proven to be a good solid tool. The selling point for me was the fact that you can open each of the blades without first opening the pliers - this is one of the few quality multi-tools that is built this way. The handle is more ergonomic than many comparable tools, and at this price it just couldn't be beat.Gerber 01471 Suspension Butterfly Opening Multi-Plier, with Sheath"
5,Awesome!,I gave these as gifts to my groomsmen. Much better than any other multi-tool that I've ever seen.
5,So far so good,"I have only had it a few weeks, but I really like it. I wish the knives were a bit longer. I have always had a leatherman, but I think this might be better. Like the spring loaded pliers."
5,Excellent Tool,This was given to me by my wife last year for Christmas. Since I've had it not a single day has passed that I haven't used it. By far the most best gift that year.
4,Great gift...,"I bought the Gerber Suspension Multi-tool as groomsmen gifts, because I wanted to find something that was actaully practical for my groomsmen. No more cheesy flasks or beermugs that will never get used.The Gerber is a great alternative to the more widely known multi-tools such as Leatherman.I liked them so much I actaully bought myself one. The pliers have proven to be very strong, yet its not overly heavy feeling in my pocket. The lock out buttons for the tools are a little stiff but I imagine they will wear in over time. Access the tools in the center of the handle can be a little difficult, but not to the point that I don't use them.I'd reccomend the Gerber too anyone who doesn't want to pay the higher price tag for the other brands."
4,"convenient, but bulky","i like this tool, but it's a little heavy, and bulky. there are a few tools that are excessive for this device, and i'm not sure how handy the tool bits are. the bits are magnetized, but the conversion bit that attaches to the tool itself does not stay on very well. i like that all of the fold out tools are locking, but the locking mechanism isn't very smooth.i would like a little more slimmed down version of this, with a larger knife, and without the tools. i can't really complain that it has a lot of tools though, convenience is the main idea with tools like this. the price is excellent, so i can't bring myself to drop this below 4 stars."
3,Supposed to be gift,"I bought this item with great anticipation as a perfect gift.I received it quickly and the item itself seems in new condition, BUT the packaging does not. The Gerber was listed as NEW. The box is crushed and the tool was in the sheath, in the box, no packaging, no instructions. No nothing. This was supposed to be a gift, I guess I will have to explain."
4,Gerber multi tool,"a very nice tool, not as hardy as the origional one I purchased years ago, but still better than most"
3,Great for the price,"This is a nice multitool especially for the price you can pay on Amazon. It's pretty sturdy and I have no major issues with it's functionality except for the phillips head screwdriver. It's really to thin to be of any hard use but works just fine for small headed screws. I also would like to find a Gerber made tool that has a small file on it, but again for what you can pay here it's a great tool."
1,Bad locking mech,"I actually purchased this at a store but the product was so disappointing, I was compelled to write a review here. The locking mechanism is crap. Once the side tools (knife, scissor, can opener etc.) are locked, good luck trying to close it again. Theres two buttons your suppose to push down while putting pressure on the spine so the tools will fold back down but the force required to do that is beyond what your hands can handle. I actually had to use a second multi-tool to collapse this one. Just looking at the quality of this and you know its suspicious, the metal is dull and rough, theres lots of little dents and divits and rough patches. I was convinced that I bought a fake, but I purchased it from L.L Bean whom I know stand by quality and wouldn't be caught dead selling something as poor as this. Then I read that Gerber changed the manufacturing of this tool from Taiwan to China after 2008.... go figure. Never buying Gerber tools again."
1,terrible!!!,"I use paraframe knife, and it is nice. I trusted the brand Gerber, so i ordered this. One of the locking systems is not working properly. I can't put the scissors back into the tool. Next time I'll buy a leatherman."
5,Never disappointment,"I have this mult-tool plier with me for my salmon fishing trip last six years, no rust after clean in the Lake Michigan and very functional. I never disappointment Gerber product and they are very good knife/mult-tool plier company. I give this amazing mult-tool plier - five stars..."
3,I still like Leatherman better,"Compared with a Leatherman Wave, I noticed these differences:* The knives are stubby* The pliers are spring loaded.* My main complaint is the locking mechanism. The thumb stud is so small it digs into your flesh.I think Leatherman's is still better. I would keep this Gerber multitool but only as a backup."
3,Good for the price...,"This is very good for the price. It has blades which are opened one handed, but the main knife blade is poor. I never use it. The other tools are decent however. This tool is good for the average person to have around for light to medium duty tasks."
5,Good looking product and a good price.,"Just bought this a few days ago. I was looking for a decent priced solid multi tool. Despite what some other reviewers said, it was delivered and looks fantastic. Its clean, no defects that I was able to notice. Everything works including the scissors. An A+ multi tool for 26 dollars, and its gerber, can't complain about that. I recommend this if your price range is about 30 dollars."
1,needle nose pliers cracked,"I was enjoying this multi-tool quite well.However i was turning a stubborn screw with the needle nose pliers ... and one half of the pliers bent and fractured all the way through the metal !so, not very well made. soft metal.the knife is extremely dull and the saw is pretty much useless (too short and very dull)the scissors are awesome.it has an excellent locking mechanism... but THE FRIGGIN PLIERS BROKE !picture of fractured metal on pliers: (copy and paste the link)[...]"
5,very handy,"Cant go wrong with a Gerber, very sturdyand they look and work awesome.Has all the proper tools for the quick fix and made to last."
1,"Weak, won't stand up to heavy use. Don't buy.","This tool broke under use when I tried to use it as part of a home project. I was using the pliers to straighten out a bent piece of metal, something that I've done tons of times with regular pliers. I figured that I could use the Gerber tool the same way.I was wrong. When I encountered a particular stubborn piece of metal, and it wouldn't give, I had to crank extra hard. Instead of the piece I was working on bending, the Gerber tool broke! One of the small metal retaining pieces that prevents the plier handles from collapsing bent under the pressure of my hand.Folks, I'm not that strong. I wasn't applying some superhuman amount of strength to the tool. Nevertheless, it still broke under the strain of me gripping it extra hard. I don't recommend anybody getting this tool if you're going to use it for serious work, or going to depend on it for an emergency."
2,Great until I used it,This multi-tool was working great up until the point when I tried to use the can opener. I used the knife and the pliers and the screwdrivers a few times...no problems. But while opening a can of tomato paste the bar that the open tools sit on (runs perpendicular to the open tool) broke. Now all the tools on that side open up too far and do not solidly lock into place...making them rather useless.
2,Go for a Leatherman,"I bought a Gerber Suspension at Walmart on clearance for $11.00 and that was too much for the tool. The wire cutters are worthless and dull. I couldn't even cut bailing wire. Incredibly heavy.... Handles are awkward and spring loaded, when you squeeze on the pliers you have a spring fighting against you and they want to open right back up. The tool is also made in china so who knows how reliable the workmanship is. Get yourself a leatherman."
2,"Sturdy, but difficult to use","This unit is well built and has served me well for more than a couple years, now. That said, I think it's very important to add that it's a real pain to get some of the tools out. Since purchase, the individual tools have been consistently stiff and difficult to get out. I frequently have to pull out the neighboring tool to get an adequate grip or to use a key to pry out the tool I want.I'm no stranger to pocket knives and tools. I've been carrying them since I was about 10 and using them for even longer. This guy may be functional, but is very difficult to use for anything beyond the pliers."
4,You call that a phillips bit?,Over all a solid tool. All tools lock and the pliers are strong. I wish it had a full sized phillips bit. There is room for it in the tool yet they use a narrow tip which does not provide much torque.
5,Awesome,"Awesome multi tool, Perfectly made, Strong, heavy duty, portable, every piece works great, I don't know if there is better one in market but this is just great for me."
4,Solid as a rock,"Great for the money. I bought these for my groomsmen and then my wife got me a leatherman skeletool cx. Very different insruments. If you want a blade, this is not for you (it reminds me of the tiny swiss army knife blade you get at the fair. If you want a solid inexpensive multitool, this is the one. If you plan on using it for a screwdriver however, you have to get the additional bits or you are stuck with a single phillips head. All in all, this is a great purchase."
2,Good price but the cheapness shows,"I have owned this tool for almost a year now, and I really don't have much good to say about it. It's bulky and cumbersome, the included belt pouch fell apart quickly and it began to rust (although not too dramatically) within the first month or two of ownership. The phillips screwdriver head is oddly shaped and not very usable and the blades are small and low quality for a tool of this heft/size. I will say, the tool itself is well made and durable other than the bit of rust that doesn't really deter from usability, but I certainly wouldn't recomend it for someone looking for a tool to meet all of there day to day needs (I work as an audio engineer)."
4,Very good compact multitool.,"Locking blades and the lightweight design make this the perfect companion for pocket, belt or backpack. Rugged enough for medium bushcraft work. Was so impressed with the durability that I purchased a second one as a gift. Amazon also had every price beat by 5-10$."
4,Great tool,"Great tool to have for the average Joe. This is my second one, and I had a Wave before that. I had my previous Gerber suspension for 7 years until I wore it out. The main straight blade became wobbly, so I downgraded it to my go bag."
4,"Very happy, Husband loves it",I gave this knife to my husband for Christmas because his old one needed replacing. He's very happy with it. However he mentioned that the saw is too small to really saw with.
4,Not bad,"On first inspection, these looked to be poorly made, but that was from a display unit at a local store.After receiving the package, I noticed that they were of better quality than the display I had handled.I was surprised to see on the package that the pliers themselves are made in Taiwan and the tools and sheath are made in China. I'm not a big fan of most anything made in China since 90% of everything I've bought was poor quality, but I have never had a problem with anything made in Taiwan.Since the pliers are the source of the tool, I don't foresee a problem with them..The sheath isn't the greatest, it reminds me of those cheapos you get with a cheap pocket knife at the swap meet, but I'm used to the leather sheath on my old leatherman that was handed down by my father.Pretty decent for the price, but not as good as a classic American made tool."
5,Bang for buck,"Most has already been put into a good detail from other reviewers. Just thought I would throw in my few cents.The blades are all fairly sharp from the get go, have worked for everything I have needed the last month.It is heavy, but feels solid because of it.The scissors work much better than I expected and give a nice clean cut. If you hold them at a strange angle sometimes they can slip and not cut. I ran into this trying to cut some loose skin from my heel. I'm not very flexible so it was hard for me to reach and it wouldn't cut until I held it right.Most everything is easy or easy enough to access, usually with one hand.The pliers have a light spring to them, I'm used to a much stronger spring back. Although it doesn't take long to get used to and I think it gives me more control for some situations."
3,Inexpensive,"Inexpensive multi tool, I'm not disappointed but you do get what you pay for. I also wish it had stated in the online description that it was made in Taiwan and China. What's up with 'American' knife makers trading on their history and heritage and then importing their stuff from overseas. Sure, it might have cost another dollar to make it in the US - I would have paid the dollar."
4,Under $30 - Can't go wrong,"Length:: 2:50 MinsPros:Under $30 (bought mine for $26)Solid, neat looking frame, very nice gunmetal looking finishSpring loaded pliers, contours my hand perfectlyNylon sheathOne handed open for major bladesIMO rivals $50-$60 leatherman products, I have owned bothNo complaints at all about craftsmanship, plier heads line upBlade lock mechanism works wellCons:inner tools are stiffwatered down phillips head is not usefull on larger screwsno fileprimary knife blade is smallOverall:Good job Gerber, I think this is the lowest price plier centered multi tool, but in no way feels cheap, does the job."
1,1st was defective 2nd one broke,I purchased the gerber suspension with high hopes. I'd never owned a multi-tool before. Partly because the Leathermans cost so much. So.... the first one was defective. The pliers were loose. The one I got in exchange broke after one week. I was crimping a fastener and about broke my thumb off when the hinge broke. A piece just popped out. So.... I am now the proud owner of a leatherman wave. You get what you pay for.
2,Chinese Garbage,"I believe, from other reviews, that the quality of this tool has dropped significantly in recent years. The handles and tools on mine look nothing like the pictures on Amazon. The edges are rough on the handles, even the torx heads look poorly machined. The jaws on mine broke after a couple of weeks of light use and since I own many other multi tools I have not bothered to send it back. I know that Gerber has great warranty service but I really don't even want another one. In my experience the multi tools made by Gerber in China are not that good, although the knives are pretty good. In short this is a good design so it gets 2 stars but the QC and workmanship is poor. I will stick with my Leatherman NEW WAVE."
4,Good tool for price,"I carry this tool every day, I'm a plumber. I like the blade lock on this will save alot of cut fingers.I used to carry a Stanley multi tool but darn near cut off my pinky when blade foldedIn on me"
2,I liked it but...,"I have the Taiwan version. I bought it back in late 2006 and it has lasted for a while, until last week. I'm not sure what type of metal it is made of, but it is brittle. I broke the larger flat head in half and the smaller flat head blade was cracked. Granted it took me five years to break it, but three of those years I hardly used it.Don't get me wrong, it was great while I had it and the main reason I bought it was because of the handle design when the pliers are deployed. I never once pinched my palm with it, which is something I did regularly with Leathermans."
3,Ok but with some flaws,the Cons...the locking switches are sometimes hard to pull down and sometimes they get stuckTheres a little wire strip that works as a spring for the Scissors if you push down too hard the strip gives way making them uselessThe philips head screw driver bit is a complete joke and uselessthe ProsBuilt solidnice sheeth includedmany different kinds of toolsall in all its a good muli tool
5,All about the toys.,It's great with the spring loaded handle but the steel is a bit inferior and will not withstand tremendous abuse so have common sense when using. but is is a good product for the buck
1,extremely poor quality,"I have had this tool three months. I dropped it onto concrete from a height of 4 inches while working. One of the blade bolts just sheared right off. This is mindblowingly poor quality. Gerber, you have no right to call any of your products ""legendary"" and you shouldn't be selling them to the military. I hope none of our servicemen put their lives at risk using the substandard garbage that you sell. I will never buy your products again and will do everything in my power to direct potential customers in another direction."
2,"Quality so-so, returned it the next day","The quality of the steel and the looks of the tool are ok. The 2 parts of the plier did not match up at the tip, something like 1-2 mm apart. Many of the tools are extremely hard to get out of the handle and the spring securing mechanism is hard to operate. This Gerber may be worth the $29 dollars but it was supposed to be used in case of emergency (in the car) by my wife and i could see that this was not a tool she would be happy with. Ordered the Victorinox Swisstool instead. I have had a Victorinox swiss army knife (with EVERYTHING) for years and have never had a problem with it."
3,even though i return it good item,gerber is a great tool and knife not much to say about the product bc i returned it but have alot of gerbers tools very good quality
2,"Cheap, but cheap","Cheap Chinese made item. I bought this and a leatherman at the same time. NO COMPARISON, the leatherman tool is much more rugged and well-built. I would not buy the Gerber again, despite being 1/3rd the price"
1,Don't waste your money!,"We bought this for our 3 yr old son for christmas. It looked great in the picture online, but is made of very flimsy cheap plastic. There are a lot of stickers that have to be placed on the toy and none of them would STICK !!! I had to tape them all on, and it looks cheap!! The little toy parts that come with it are really tiny !! None are larger than 1"". Overall just a really cheap product."
3,the second elswyth thane,"I am becoming more convinced that two people wrote Elswyth Thane's books. One wrote the Williamsburg novels, The Tudor Wench and Queen's Folly. Someone else wrote Tryst, The Lost General, Remember the Day,Cloth of Gold etc.The first set of books are characterized by believable characters, good dialogue, a strong sense of place, and interesting plots. Their ""romance"" builds from the ground up. The second set are basically trite and silly, full of breathless melodrama. I just finished The Lost General, hoping to find a book in her first ""set."" It was OK but at about the level of the romance stories I used to read in Good Housekeeping magazine as a teenager. Cloth of Gold is truly one of the most annoying books I've tried to read this year--I stopped after 100 pages or so."
1,Shallow as Only Pat Schroeder Can Be,Not recomended. Better to wait until a person with a shred of credibility co-authors a book on this topic.
2,Good product but overpriced by this merchant.,"When I ordered this product online, I was under the impression that my local markets were not carrying it anymore. Now I realize I just looked in the wrong area of the coffe aisle. I do not feel like I got good value for the money although the product is ok."
5,The most powerful devotional I have ever experienced.,"No matter how weary you may be, how discouraged, how bruised by life and its problems, The Power of the Cross can truly impact your daily life and spiritual growth. Charles Stanley's reflections on the Bible verses in this book of prayers are meant for anyone, regardless of what stage of spirituality you are in, and no matter what is going on at any particular moment in your life. I am personalizing these words, because this spiritual resource should be used by everyone -- including YOU. The Power of the Cross can be your compass, and bring you hope and joy."
3,Informative but not inspirational,"A slip accompanying this book suggests that the four ""portable altars"" will pop up to ""Enhance Your Meditation Experience."" Although the text gave me quite a bit of information about the four Buddhist Goddesses that popped up with the altars, there was little in the presentation that would ""enhance"" meditation. Bruce Foster's paper engineering is well done, as is the artwork from Robert Beer, and the textual material by Tad Wise is both interesting and informative."
4,Excellent Work!,"This is just another glimpst at the leaps of thought made by this brilliant thinker, far too often neglected by his friend and often co-author Gilles Deleuze. As usual with Guattari, this is a very challenging read. I do not think he was the best of writers. It does not flow very well and at points you'd wish he gave an extensive glossary or something along those lines, but overall, for sheer theoretical value this book is invaluable for anyone interested in the philosophy of Deleuze & Guattari."
4,A good overview of life on a carrier,"While I thoroughly enjoyed the video, its focus was on the city-like life that exists on today's gigantic aircraft carriers. I was hoping for more detailed information about the technical workings of these massive ships and their battle groups, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
1,Nova: Aircraft Carrier (VHS),"Of the multiple items I purchased this was the only VHS item. Be that as it may, a product should be in good working order when sold. The video was played only once by my husband, because during rewind, the tape tangled in our machine. I have no problems with other videos we still have and play in our home. I can only assume the product was defective before it was sold to us."
3,"Sliders, the tv series","Read my review under season four. This series has hidden elements worth seeing, too bad so much of it is mediocre, but that is most often the case. Like crumbs along the path of life, we have to find our way back 'home'."
4,Overall great stuff,"The first season of SLIDERS is by far the best, mixing sci-fi and comedy/satire while providing us with some interesting characters. Unfortunately, Universal put the episodes out of order on this set. You have to watch them like this: Pilot Episode, Summer of Love, Prince of Wails - and then after that, the order doesn't matter as much.Best episodes of the season (besides the pilot) include: Fever, Last Days, and Eggheads.The second season is a little dumber in its plotting, and the show loses its crucial sense of humor about itself, but the cast is still intact at this point and there are some definite gems. Best episodes: Invasion, Post Trumatic Slide Syndrome, As Time Goes By, The Young and the Relentless, and Greatfellas."
4,Missing shows,"I just purchased the set and found out that on the first DVD the pilot episode plays, but the other two episodes will not.I made an exchange and the second one I bought has the same two episodes missing. They will not play for some reason. Otherwise it is great."
3,"Great series, disappointing DVD set","This was a great series, but the quality of the DVD's could have been much better. Besides the bad packaging, apparently some episodes apparently were omitted from the set. The picture quality of the DVD's is nothing great-- a bit dark and fuzzy but acceptable. I bought my own storage cases to replace the very bad one with the foam inside, which did not provide adequate protection for the discs. This should not have been necessary. It is not an expensive set, but it seems the fans of this show could have been offered something much better. Unfortunately, this is the only set available of seasons one and two, which I think were the best in the series. Hence the three star rating-- the show itself deserves a five."
4,Great Sci Fi,"Seasons 1 and 2 are excellent, while this show went downhill in Season 3 it was still fun to watch."
4,Sliders,As someone previously mentioned this is something we have been waiting for for years. The first two seasons are gold. Eloquent allegory. I agree with dpcole's review of season 3. FOX bastardized the series in an attempt to garner higher ratings. I wouldn't call it 99% bad. Just perhaps 75 or 80% trash. Don't even waste your time if they release seasons four and five. SCI-FI diminished it even further than FOX's third season. Cheesy low budget special effects and a complete 180 on the original premise.Just really glad we have the first two seasons on DVD.
5,Hooked from the first episode,"So I remember watching this show when it originally aired, but I was young enough that I dont remember any of the story lines. I bought the pilot episode on iTunes to see if I would still enjoy the show, and I was hooked. I had to own the dvds right away! This series is a must for any sci-fi fans out there. I burned through the entire box set in about a week (yes I realize I have no life, Im used to it). Bring your friends and family into the sci-fi world with this interesting, and easy to follow, fun and highly entertaining tv series."
1,worst...packaging...ever,"So clearly I am not commenting on the contents of this show, which I love, and still enjoy. Why does the FOX network always screw up shows by airing them out of order? So then whoever put these dvds together puts them in the order that they aired, instead of the order they go in... then they put them on the discs in an order that forces you to watch disc one, two two one one two... (I believe that is correct)AND THEN... They choose, from all the hundreds of types of dvd packaging, they choose FOAM, with slits cut in it. You would have to scrape the discs in and out... If you did not have any extra cases around, but I recommend you do have some, one for each disc. The foam doesn't even stay glued into the box. This is a great value, but I hate the packaging so much. So, so, very much."
3,Packaging is a poor joke.,"The DVD's themselves are fine, the show is pretty much as I remembered it..but the packaging sucks, as others have noted.Seriously, the outside label is held on with a blob of that snotty-silicone stuff, the package itself is made of thin celluloid (think new shirt collar stuffing) and thinner cardboard (think cereal box), and the discs are held in place by a sponge with slots cut in it.Not particularly long-lasting packaging, and not much protection for the media it holds, either.Good series, but think seriously about buying a real multi-disc box to store the discs in."
2,Really cheap packaging,Buyers beware! The packaging on this product is extremely cheap. The dvds are in a piece of foam with slits cut into it. Someone cut corners to make this cheaper. If you can find this new or used for a cheaper price then go ahead. It is not worth over $15 IMO.I liked the first few seasons of this show. If it wasn't for the cheap packaging this would have gotten a higher rating.
5,A lot like Twilight Zone,"Sliders, is a very good series that seems like a long Twlight Zone episode. The idea of alternate Earths and how small changes can change a world as we know it. Sliders is a very enjoyable show and makes you think that choices do matter."
5,Sliders I Love U !,"The best thing that has seen sliders for my it was a super series the best thing that there was and when feeling this so close I am glad I am but that for sure I was one of the fans #1 of this you go saw the chapters how many times could and I never got tired, This Deserves 5 stars!"
4,Great to have this on DVD but...,This was a great show that deserved better treatment and a better package on DVD. Alan Hummel said it best. Scroll down and read his review.
4,Sliders - First & Second Seasons,"This was a very interesting series if you like the idea of parallel worlds, which are endlessly fascinating to me. The pro is it stayed interesting and engaging throughout Series 1 and part of Series 2. The con is later in Series 2, the theme became a bit repetitive (different stories but same theme). The last episode in Series 2 was a great change of pace, and the series became alive for me again.I recommend this if you enjoy scifi and having your mind stretched to consider alternative ideas. ""Sliders"" is entertaining and handles the character analysis well, meaning that the characters act human because the individuals don't always respond to situations the same every time, and most of them grow more mature as the series progresses. It was worth the money and the time.Not sure if there is a Series 3, but will buy it if there is."
4,"great show, horrible packaging",I bought seasons 1-4 and all are packaged in ways that are likely to damage the dvds. Still a great show at an unbeatable price
4,SF Television Classic,"Sliders was a FOX TV that Fox didn't mess up-THANK GOD!The first season of Slider began 3/95-12 years ago and the show barely dates itself. It blends action with adventure and comedy. It was not filled with special Effects, it was filled with stories of the human condition with characters you can relate to.The show may seem similar to Time Tunnel, however it modern day format keeps this show interesting. So Slide with our 4 heroes weekly into another diamentionThis collection block is season 1 & 2 of Slidersis a great buy and a good show to add to any SF libraryBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
2,Dual-dimension crap packaging,"This review solely addresses the matter of packaging and stupid design ideas. It is weird enough to simply put the discs into a dubious soft plastic cut-out block. Who would not be concerned that such material might scratch or even chemically deteriorate the disc surfaces (similar stuff used in CD boxes probably did). Even if it will not: who can give a guarantee.So it certainly would seem to be a good idea if you put the discs into amaray cases. But here the ultimate lunacy triumphs: the box is ever so slightly less high than these are, so they won't fit.Universal might not even have chosen that idiot box out of cheapishness because its production may well be more expensive than a solid one. They should better have put a booklet in it instead of that glued-to-the-box mini-folder.Is there a punishment for designers out of their mind or executives who allow them to live out their creative irresponsibilities and failures? Only in an alternative better dimension."
5,FFFFFFFINALLY.......,"Sliders fans have been waiting for this DVD set for years and finally we are getting what we have wished for. Seasons 1 and 2 were probably the best of the series but in all honesty the entire series was excellent. What I don't understand is how these other reviewers can say that all of the other seasons were bad. None of you guys are true fans if you didn't enjoy any other season except for 1 and 2.In my opinion the show was still good even after they moved it over to the SCI-Fi Network. Except for Jerry O Connell's brother and his horrid acting, the show was still better than any other sci fi crap that was out. Universal- PLEASE release the other seasons as fast as possible because there are still some true fans out here that loved every single season and not just the first 2!!!! And DO NOT LISTEN TO REVIEWERS LIKE dpcole7. How dare you say that season 3 was ""99.8% crap."""
4,Great Show! but what's with the box?,"I'll agree with the majority of the reviewers here...the show was entertaining, but slid as time went on. My only gripe with the Season 1-2 boxset is the packaging. Yes, it looks really nice sitting on your shelf. Getting to your discs for viewing and putting them away makes one wish they had the ability to send the designer to an alternate universe! First, there's a cheap foam insert with slots cut into it that the discs slide into. Gee, what better way to scratch a disc. Get a little dirt in there, and it'll be worse than one of those cd books at destroying the disc. Then, there's a clear plastic cover that you're supposed to remove to gain access to the discs. Once I fought to get this off, it never did fit back together as it kept hanging up on the foam. After experiencing this once, I immediately got online and ordered a six disc dvd box to put my set in."
4,Great show when the network stayed out.,"The first two seasons are great. I highly recommend this set. As much as the last season blows, without Jerry O'Connell (and of course without John Rhys-Davis and Sabrina Lloyd). It's a shame the original creators of the show had their vision of it ruined by interference from the network which wanted more ""action"" and less cerebral plots with alternate histories in them. That came about starting with season 3, which is why I really enjoy the first two seasons. It was a different and interesting show all the way through it's 5 year run, but it was most interesting, in my view, in the first two seasons. Sci-fi channel did bring it back more toward it's roots in season 4."
3,"Great show, but the packaging isn't!","When this was on the tube I was a big fan, but I had totally forgotten about it until it showed up on the Zune Marketplace site. After doing the math I figured it was more cost effective for me just to buy the DVD's. If you are into to this sci fi stuff this is a must own. Well of course you are otherwise you wouldn't even be here...Duh!Anyway the first two seasons are really very good, after that they are ok but really nothing to write home about.But man the packaging/box of this,well for the lack of a better phrase...sucks. Who ever came up with it should be taken out back behind the wood shed and severely taught a lesson in mass marketing.I gave it only 3 stars because of the packaging. If it had been packaged like the stargate series, a big 5 stars!"
5,This was a great show!,This show was great for the first few seasons. People who have not seen it should try the season 1&2 box set.... hey it's only $15!!
4,"Quinn, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore......","Sliders is quite possibly my favorite TV series. In this season, we see the origins of the sliders, as Quinn, a young genius, invents the timer, and slides out of our reality and into another. Accompanying him are a group of friends, including his girlfriend, a musician, and a grouchy professor.I think some of the early episodes of Sliders are a little slow. But as the season progresses sliders really begins to hit its stride. I love the episode where they slide into the Matriarchal world, and the episode where S.F. is one big penal colony. The formula for this series really allows for infinite plotlines and possibilities.Since this is filmed in Canada, I had to suspend belief a tad when scenes which were obviously NOT filmed in S.F. were shown (no snow-topped peaks in this S.F. for instance), other than that, this is an excellent, excellent series well worth the investment.4 stars."
3,From a non-American,"I found out about this show through Amazon. Read some reviews and bought it to try it out. I have watched quite a number of US shows and I must say that this series has a good concept. Having said this, I didn't like the way the concept was presented in this series.1. The sliders always point their fingers to the parallel universe everytime they got into trouble2. The sliders love to linger to the last minute before they slide at the end of each episode3. Sliders were always so eager to reveal secrets of their origins each episode (Season 1 & 2)4. Sliders love to get involved in the world they are inBuy this only if you are a fan or have extra cash. Those who are curious, borrow it from a friend who has it or buy from Marketplace."
3,Remember Worf?,"Has no-one seen Star Trek the Next Generation?If you have think back to when Worf went through a worm hole or something and went to another dimension. This happens throughout the episode a few times invariably but nevertheless Sliders is not as original as you may think. Still a pretty good show though, I may pick it up."
1,"Sliders went off the slide into insanity,,,,","This was among the brainless ideas for a time travel TV show ever.All the cast did was look good, but they had no scripts to work with, and the multi-story arcs with so many things happening at once made it too difficult to understand, much less like."
4,Definitely entertaining!,"I remember this series when it first aired 13 years ago (WOW! time flies...). I am watching them now and enjoing them even more. I have been studying leading edge theoretical physics for the last 5 years(Quantum theory, Relativity, Cosmology, String Theory, nuclear physics and astrophysics), therefore I am more understanding of the sliding concept and the technical language used occasionally during the show. Yes, some of the episodes and the special effects are on the cheesy side(low budget), but the cast is excellent and humor is appropiate when used during the shows (The Professor is hysterical everytime a landing occurs). Overall this is a great show that did not get the credit it deserves."
5,Fantastic Turtle Text,"This is one of the best ""Turtle & Tortoise"" books I've ever read. Scientifically sound, but not scientifically dry, it contains species names for every animal shown, and it shows many, many beatiful photos of representatives from all families of chelonians. Distinguishing among the sea turtles, ""typical"" turtles, side-necked turtles, tortoises, etc., and clearly (in non-dry terms) explains in a very fascinating way the differences and the nature of these animals. Profusely illustrated, high-quality binding and paper, authoritative, just the very best introductory book I've seen on the subject."
1,Garbage,This DVD is total garbage! I had bought it just because of Kassim but what a huge waste of money.
4,Very Good Deal,"The other reviewers said the annotations were crap, so I haven't bothered reading them for the most part, and when I did they weren't much help. Personally, I haven't found any of the errors they have been talking about (it would be nice if these critics were more specific) but I haven't been looking.very carefully.(...) I use it all the time.Generally, I consider the 9899:1990 ANSI standard of C to be the ""gold standard"" I want to adhere to if I'm in C - the few enhancements to the language that have come along since then aren't worth using, since the maintainer of your code will probably be using the 1989 k&r; as his language reference manual, so he won't understand those enhancements, plus you may want to port to a platform that doesn't support them."
3,"Good for the ANSI C reference, bad for the annotations.","Schildt's annotations to the reference are in some cases misleading, in some cases confusing, and in many case just plain wrong. I'd recommend this book for someone who isn't able or willing to get the ANSI C reference directly from ANSI itself, but don't get it for the annotations."
5,The cheapest and best way to get the ANSI standard,"Before ordering this book from Amazon, I read all the other reviews. To be honest, I bought it because it was a lot cheaper than the ANSI standard ($130). Frankly, I do not understand why it is rated that low by the other readers. It includes the complete, unmodified standard, and it very well annotated by Schildt. The author, however, sometimes states things that are certainly not derived from the standard. Possibly they are derived from his almost 20 years programming in C and his deep knowledge of compilers. In my opinion, this book is a must for everybody willing to program in C and expecting his programs to run in every platform"
4,Unique Big Band,"This is a great big band disc with lots of wonderful arrangements of great tunes. Dan Gailey, Professor of Jazz Studies at KU is a very talented arranger and has a lot of great work on this. This CD's is definately worth checking out if you like Maria Schneider, Bill Holman, or Gil Evans arrangements."
4,Handy little device,"I got this little pink MP3 player, and I like it a lot. I like the way you can clip it onto your clothes or belt, etc. The only complaint is that it doesn't last the five hours it claims in the booklet, but I can still get a few hours before it goes dead. For someone who just wants some tunes, but can't afford the high end MP3 players, I recommend this."
2,"great if first mp3 player, not for IPOD owners","I bought this as an inexpensive replacement for my daughter when her IPOD shuffle was stolen. Bad mistake. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice little mp3 player. The problem is that all of my daughter's music is under I-Tunes, which formats music that you legitimately own in such a way that you can only copy the music over to an IPOD. Anything that's not an IPOD will read the music as copywrited and will not play the music.If you're not using I-Tunes, buy this, you'll like it.If you already use I-Tunes, don't buy this."
2,LETS GET REALLY SPECIFIC,"Hey guys. This Coby MP_3 player is really reliable under 1 condition.The USB jack heats a little causing the microboard inside to loosen up.It is great, comes with a handy adapter for those 3.5mm jacks (majordrawback-not standard) and for those who really are serious about their purchase,the pink and silver models are different. The pink has a mini usb jack, andthe silver model has a standard usb jack, again very nice 4 the price, but onevery important detail, it is NOT for everyday use, (Coby USA has plenty of wonderfulmusic players portable and home audio) I use and recommend the coby jammerz earphonesthe bass is so rich and it never drowns your music out."
1,Not replacing this.,"I won this in a drawing so for something free, I can't complain too much. However after maybe 2-3 uses, it no longer plays even after charging.The play button seems to have been pushed in and no longer clicks. This may be a reason why I can't get it playing. I won't get a replacement."
5,Elastikon,"LOVE it! I use this for the dogs as they can't chew it off easily and it stays put. I do martial arts and have blister issues on my hands when I'm handling certain weapons, Elastikon over a bandaid on a sore blister does the trick! Also used it on an irritating part of a knife handle and it doesn't scrape my hands anymore! Just don't wind it too tight or it'll cut off your circulation..."
5,Timex Easy Reader Watch 24611,"I LOVE my watch! I had a fancy women's watch that I could not see to read the time. I thought this one was a women's watch; however, I love it because I can actually see the time AND the day and date. It is large and I was going to return it, but it is very classy looking and I love-love-love it. AND, I can even see the time when I wke up at night - the backlight is great and I can see the time when it's pitch black too."
3,Not the original versions,"These are remakes of the original songs for better or worse. Some of the remixes are very cool but if your looking for the original versions of the songs, get the Greatest Hits CD with the black cover."
3,Find The orginals,this is a half-hearted attempt at making money off the name of the group&repackaging it's classic work.Rose Royce is a solid Group go check out there classic material in it's uncut Original format.
4,Maybe its just me....,"I heard this on Yahoo LAUNCHCAST (THe majority of it.) It is hard to believe that YAHOO & AMAZON would be selling a cheap rip-off of an original. (K-TELL presents:) I have seen the band on televison a couple of times recently. (I have heard a couple of cuts from the LIVE CD) And I do believe that this is that band. (Maybe not all original members?) I'd say check it out! Me personally I'm buying it, because if I'm correct and this band has just gone through and made changes. Its a tight recording! And if I'm wrong? (Then somebody may need to take credit for making a good thing better!)"
1,Who's that female singer,Not the original lead female singer. She knows the words but now the song are off a little. I will listen more intently to the previews before purchasing again.
3,LOST SOME OF THE FEELING...,This CD is ok but it has lost some of the feeling durig this re-make. I was a true fan of Rose Royce from way back (during the period that most of these songs were originally released). Trust me when I tell you that this re-make does NOT do justice for the originals!
4,this music can't not better,"hey i'm a fan of belguim and I was a fan from rose royce in the begin of he's career and I like them very much the bautyful sounds of them they making not anymore ,greetings"
1,never again.,"the kids liked making it, but i didn't like picking up the dandelion moss after he 'blossmed' not a hit for the grownup"
4,Needed more water.,Gave this to someone 1800 miles away. 4 year old. At first didn't grow that great. Suggested to mother to adding more water. Turned out great. Just like the photo.
5,Fun,This was a great stocking stuffer. Learning about growing crystals was a lot of fun and the snowman is cute. It was easy to do and I would recommend it as a great gift.
5,Fun Toy but no educational value,This is a really fun toy. It doesn't last more than a few days but it is still really cool to see it grow overnight. You can really see the progress of the crystals growing within a few hours. I'm a 22yo and I still had fun with this toy. Thanks
1,Potential missed,"This had potential to be cool, but I think they missed it. I think it was a huge mistake to do almost all of the dunks in slow motion, or that weird jerky rewind view. There are many dunks that they never show just in real time, as it happened. I watched this because I wanted to watch real streetball, not some overproduced, trying-to-make-it-seem-cool camera/effects tricks. It's cool enough on it's own, without that, but we don't get to see it. The effects didn't make it more exciting for me, they just gave me a headache and made me wish I was watching real clips on YouTube. Disappointing."
1,Crappy product. Don't waste your money.,The thread on the brass plug has nicks in it which proved impossible to screw the plug into the drilled bolt head. I would have had to re-thread it to make it work. Save yourself some cash and a headache and find a higher quality product.
5,GREAT,"AS a Christian I find this show to be up lifting and Great, It brings the stories more to life then I can explain. Truly Our God is always with us and that he will never forsake us! Thnak you God for The gift of Jesus Christ! our salvation."
2,Inaccurate Trivia Book,"I received this book as a gift. I thought it would be fun to have a contest, via email, with my Giant fan friends. I sent one question a day to the contestants. I have been through 46 questions and found 4 answers to be wrong. I question his research.This book otherwise has been fun. It brings back a lot of fun memories."
1,"I was suckered into Charles J. Givens ""GET RICH QUICK"" B.S.","In 1985 after attending a Charles J. Givens financial seminar, I along with 3 other people, bought a house using Givens techniques presented at the seminar, which are essentially a summary of what is in his books. We ended up losing several thousand dollars each. Education is expensive. Stay away from get rich quick schemes. Ask yourself, ""If this is such a great idea, why on God's Green Earth is this person NOT actually practicing these techniques instead of writing a book, or giving seminars about it. Answer is, because they can make more money, easier selling the books/seminars than they can actually doing what they preach."
3,A reasonable investment of your time and money,"This book is the predecessor of the excellent best-seller ""More Wealth Without Risk"". This book is not as useful or as comprehensive as MWWR, but the two books are largely complementary without too much overlap. If you are know little of personal finance, insurance, investing, etc. in the USA, then I would recommend that you buy both books -- both will save you some money and help you make more informed decisions. Givens has a reputation as a bit of a rogue but he is smart and humerous. Take care to apply his suggestions carefully so that you don't leave yourself exposed (some strategies will only work if you apply all elements), but do try them -- some are easy no brainers that will save you hundreds of dollars with little effort. Insurance sales people must hate these books! Ha!"
5,"I'm a PAW, Thank you Mr. Givens","Also read Millionaire next Door (which should be read right along with Financial Self Defense). By use of the strategies in Financial Self Defense, I was able to buy my dream car for 60% less, switch from a overprced Cash Value Life Insurance policy to a Term policy and got three times the protection at 1/2 the cost, cancelled the credit life and disability off two personal oans and the mortgage life off of our mortgage and got a refund (which came in handy) also switched from a 30 year mortgage to a 15. We are forever graeful to Mr Givens for writing this excellent book. It has helped us to make a quantum leap in our finances. By the way, since Mr. Givens paid $27,000 for a $90,000 Excalibur, would you say that it's safe to say Mr. Givens is a PAW??"
3,A guide for management personal money,"This books gives you more than 100 strategies for manage your money, since the personal goals until tax strategies.This book is a real base for maximize the personal profit of the money."
5,Personal relationship and Forever Friend...,"This book wonderfully presents God's personal interest in every part of our lives. For whatever reason, the book may not speak the same to every individual. I found myself excited to see such a profound book written to help searchers looking for a more personal relationship with God and to aid in getting beyond several walls that certain practice of religion has built. It further illustrates the true power and freedom found within a continual and personal walk with our Creator and Redeemer that just attending church or schooling at a seminary cannot provide. I can personally testify, with many stories in my life, to the fact that God does care about the minute details of our lives."
5,Inspirating book!,"I have known and met the author, Jim Hohnberger for a few years. It speaks about how God worked through his daily life. He shared about his life experience with his family. How to submit our self to God. Are we really ready to listen for God's voice? What powerful words from God! How he explained to people how they could live better lives. Why did he leave the city? Because God impressed him that in the city he was be so occupied with other things that he wasn't working for God and didn't have time to work with his family. When he was in the country he had time to be with and help his family and he experienced how to live the way God wanted him to live. How God worked through Jim's heart. I have heard that many of people was changed through by God's grace. I recommended this book."
3,emphasis on deepening your relationship on God,This book did not have much information about the family's experiences moving to the wilderness. There are some stories but the main point of the book is the writers growing awareness of and dependence on God. It has some great points but seems a little repetitive.
1,A disappointing book.,"I certainly agree with the two previous reviews. I think the main problem is that Fussell went into World War II as a young man with his head full of youthful misconceptions (nothing unusual there), and then, when those misconceptions were rudely contradicted, decided that the fault lay not with himself for his lack of realism, but rather with the world (or the U.S. government) instead. ""Confused"" truly is the accurate summary for this book, which, when you consider that Fussel also wrote the first rate ""The Great War and Modern Memory"", is very disappointing. For a wartime memoir of a young man who went into battle with a minimum of fantasies, I would recommend George MacDonald Fraser's ""Quartered Safely Out Here"". Or if one wants to read about the soldier as victim (but without the self-pity), Guy Sajer's ""The Forgotten Soldier"" or Vaino Linna's ""The Unknown Soldier""."
1,Fussell goes to war himself and does not approve.,"I had read Fussell's The Great War prior to reading this one, and found chunks of it of real interest. I then read Wartime and found it unhappily stupid, except around the fringes. That we sided with Joe Stalin was one of those historical entanglements that are an obscene adjunct of the obscenity of war, but that we reacted to Hitler's unspeakable atrocities was not an obscenity but a necessity. Fussell had to serve in the war and did not like it, and who would blame him for that? But he spreads his dissatisfactions all around, with no apparent real sense of the times he lived in, and he does dishonor to any of the members of that war by his book. Of course he has every right to have written it; that's part of what was at stake in those battles."
4,Gigantic screwup?,"When I first read this years ago, I was disappointed in Fussell's apparent ""dim view"". I'm inclined now to agree more with his impressions of the war I fought in, although I would be more foregiving and even-handed in my presentation if I were to write the same kind of essay. The war was a gigantic foul-up, of course, but that's what wars are. Few professionals fight wars. No real planning or practice is possible. Nobody wants to be there and do those things."
2,Scholarly essays more than memoir,"I enjoyed listening to Mr. Fussell's commentary in Ken Burn's ""The War"" documentary and thought I might benefit from reading this book. This book consists mostly of essays, but I found it rather tedious to read at times----perhaps those who share his literary scholarship would appreciate this format more than a general audience. I did appreciate his sentiments about the absurd romanticism and the lack of shared sacrafice surrounding WW2---and am sympathetic to his obvious anger and resentment as a result. I would have preferred reading a memoir that was more of a straightforward, revealing narrative (omitting esoteric literary references) about his combat experience."
1,Every Time is Wartime When You're a Cranky Bitter Old Man,"A book that lies, Fussell presents his book as scholarly, when in fact it is a thinly veiled political manifesto rife with shoddy research, obvious bias, and evidence of no historical value (His habit of using fiction as evidence of historical truth is apalling and irritating). All in all, the book can be safely described as utter trash. Currently a doorstop to my dorm room."
2,"maybe they sound good, but...","for the most part, the 4 Seasons did not have hits with these cover versions of others hits; I will stick to their originals, thank you, like Sherry, Walk Like a Man, and of course, Dawn, go away, I'm no good for youuuuuu.....!!!! Peace!"
4,A return to speed,"Over the years Face to Face have gone from So. Cal. emotional punk rockers to alternative with much loudness in between. After ""Ignorance is Bliss"" was released last year, many fans abandoned all hope that the band would rock out with the same intensity/velocity again. Personally, I loved that album and thought it showed great maturity, not only in the writing of the songs, but also the harmonies used. But with ""Reactionary"", Face to Face returns with an album that shows a decent combination of their old speedy punk/pop songs complexity of composition shown on Ignorance is Bliss. The band marketed the songs from this album online several months before its release, allowing fans to vote on which songs to include. Therefore, I think fans of older Face to Face material will be generally pleased with this album, and those few of us who enjoyed ""Ignorance"" should as well. Overall, it's a sound buy. I'd recommend picking this one up if you are a fan."
5,driven and inspired,"once again face to face did what they do best. create an album full of energy and emotion from start to finish. my respect grows for this group of musicians with every new album.trevers vocals soar, as the album bursts forward clean and smooth. the track ""Disappointed"" is a punk rock masterpiece. it rocks. highlights include ""Disappointed"", ""Best Defense"", ""Whats in a Name?"", ""Icons"", and ""Think for Yourself."" face to face's lyrics are always 3 incredible things all at once throughout this album: intense, straight-forward, and emotional.As for where it stands compared to their other albums, its one of my favorites. just as good as anything from Dont Turn Away to Standards and Practices(the best punk cover album released in 1999--done the way a true cover album should be done). That says alot right there, just because of the awesome albums they have to their credit. Bottom Line---Add Reactionary to your library, tell all your friends, and wear it out."
4,Back to Punk,This cd is great. Face To Face goes back to there punk rock roots. I would say this cd is more like there self titled cd. If you liked that you will love this. I saw them lastnight at a cd release show in hollywood and there new songs sound great live. I recommend this cd for any Face to Face fan
2,Reactionary to what? Quality?,"For a band that has earned a reputation as one of the best and most-respected punk rock bands in the genre, Face to Face's 2000 imprint, Reactionary, seems like a misstep. I'm in agreement with allmusic.com - it does take more than pissed off vocals and fast tempos to make a good punk album. Face to Face has unfortunately made an album here that is very average - ordinary message, weak lyrics, simple song structure - clearly not the benchmarks of one of punk's best and most respected bands. Check out self-titled or How to Ruin Everything to hear the band in top form. NOT ESSENTIAL."
4,Face To Face is Back,"Wow! This is a total 360 from Ignorance IS Bliss. They are back with their normal selves. This album is more punk than Ignorance Is Bliss. I heard some of the songs they put out on the internet for fans to vote for, and I knew this would be a great album. It was very cool how they had the fans vote for which songs would be on the album. They dedicated this album to all of their fans. In my opinion the best song on the album is Shame On Me, or Disappointed. Then the rest of the cd is awesome. It is not as good as their self titled, which will probably always be their best."
3,face to face has made a comeback,"this cd is solid.some really good songs, but it is not anything compared to any of the albums before IGB. I do recomened picking up this album if your a fan. it it's good but i did expect a little more from face to face....but then life isn't fair now is it"
3,better than ignorance,"this ones better than the last,but anything would be better than that.they go back to the style that we like,fast,loud,punk pop.not as good as their earlier work.i'd recomend buying big choice,live,or self titled first album."
2,Don't Get Your Hopes Up,"After the disaster known as Ignorance Is Bliss, F2F rushes this ablum out a year later. Coincidence? I think not. Everything about this album is standard, from the adolescent lyrics and mediocre vocals to the annoyingly catchy choruses. F2F breaks no new ground. Although F2F attempted to recapture their old fans with their old style, this album still has some of the elements that made IIB one of the worst albums of last year."
1,"Try harder, guys.","We all know that F2F can do better than this. Coming from the same band that did DTA, this is a big disappointment."
2,About as good as can be expected....,"F2F stopped making good music about 4 years ago, but this is one of their better albums since then. It's not as abysmal as their previous ablum, yet it's no where near Don't Turn Away. Maybe I'm just expecting too much from a punk band."
2,"Better than IIB, but really nothing special.","If you're expecting DTA or Big Choice, you're going to be a little disappointed. This album still has some of the elements of IIB that made many of their fans dump them. Mixed with this is the energy that the band had 7 years ago. Overall it's not a bad album, but F2F with never regain their former glory. This is no surprise considering that it's a completely different band now. If Amazon.com allowed half stars, I might be tempted to give this album 2 1/2 stars. My suggestion is not to buy this album if you are not a fan already. If you are new to F2F, start with Don't Turn Away. It's been a slow, but steady decline since then."
4,DISREGARD MY FIRST REVIEW!,"Well after the second time around listening to reactionary, I needed to give a little more input. It seems that face to face has returned to their roots, letting out 12 more genuine face to face punks songs as we all know them to perform. However I see that they have lightnend their style a little bit, some songs harder than others. But besides that face to face has returned form their awful experimenting from their last album ""Ignorance is Bliss"". ""Dissapointed"" and ""Best Defense"" are my favorite songs. For all you face to face fans that left, I urge you to give them a second chance. Face to Face has come back. Although not their best work or ability, they still came out with one great album. For all you true fans this is a must have."
1,More pop trash from a dead punk band.,"F2F may have wet dreams about being Blink 182, but it just isn't going to happen. After 7 years and still not breaking into the mainstream, they should just give up."
1,Not so great,"This book was not what I thought. Activities are very basic and it is a small paperback book without many illustrations, so it's up to you to figure out the descriptions."
4,Great book for long winters indoors with young kids...,This is a nicely organized book. You can pick crafts based on holidays or the type of craft - food/paint etc.Most all crafts you can do at home with things you should already have in house.Perfect for those with young kids living in the midwest/east coast with the LONG cold winters indoors!!
4,The Arts and Crafts Busy Book review,I gave this book to my Niece -in-law.She liked it but it did not tell what age the activities were meant for.She didn't like that she had to figure that out as she went.For example;her 1 1/2 year old ate the peanut butter play dough instead of playing with it.But I think that is part of her learning process as a mother.So I think this is a good book.
3,beware the curved face,"The watch is nice, but the picture is deceiving. The face is curved, making it easier to read the numbers but really changes the look. The bezel is also really big and heavy. Might be best to check it out in person before ordering."
1,Not available after ordering it. Seems like an old trick of Loss Leaders. I don't believe the person ever had it.,Was advertised at great price which I believe was a ploy to get me to purchase something else.The item was supposedly not available anymore.
4,an excellent space music cd,"This cd is definitely a good electronic/space soundscape. Similar to some steve roach works, but it does not reach the heights of electronic master Klaus Schulze, who is the greatest in this field, in my opinion. Anyway, if you like schulze and roach, this cd will not dissapoint you."
2,very badly sanded and painted,"Don't buy this unless you plan to repaint it. This is not ""shabby chic"", it's poor workmanship.Okay, what did I expect for this price? If I had noticed the shipping charge was larger than the price, I might have found something that looked better at Walmart for less.The only good thing I can say about it, is the pieces were cut and fitted well. It's very poorly sanded, parts of it were sprayed with black primer before coating the whole thing in a flat white paint that looks like plaster. The paint has blobs and bits of wood debris embedded in it. Then it was scraped in various places to expose the black primer to look ""distressed"". The design scratched into the doors is very ugly. The wooden pegs on the knobs weren't glued, and pulled off as soon as I opened the doors.With some sanding and semi-gloss paint, it might be a nice little cabinet."
3,PAY ATTENTION TO SIZE IN DESCRIPTION!,"It's a VERY cute cabinet, and fits in the corner of my tiny bathroom off the garage well. However, the cabinet is tiny itself. I didn't really pay attention to the measurements, because of my enthusiasm at finding such a cute corner cabinet, lol! I'm hoping that they will stack well and not look too awkward, as I just ordered another to go on top of the original. :0)"
2,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!,"This is a very cute cabinet and from the picture it looks pretty big right? WRONG!!! it is a TINY cabinet that can hold nothing more than a tea set as shown in the picture and if you recieve it and don't like the productthen it is a pain to send it back to the seller you have to e-mail them to get the ""RMA"" code from them and it is just a hassel!!! all in all i was VERY dissapointed in this product."
1,Dissapointed.,"I was so excited to receive this product. I just moved into my new home and couldn't wait to complete my powder room with this cabinet. I waited & waited & the product never came! I did receive an e-mail from the seller explaining that their inventory didn't reflect their listing on amazon & apprently they were out of the item! Although I received a full refund, I am so upset that a mistake like that could have been made! Whom ever is in charge of their inventory needs to get it together! I spent all this time waiting around for the item to arrive that I missed out on purchasing it from another seller at a reasonable price! Very dissapointed."
2,Corner Cabinet,I should have paid more attention to the dimensions in the ad; the cabinet is so small it could be used in a Childs playhouse. Plus it needs to be re-painted.
2,Really is shabby chic,"I was very disappointed in this cabinet. It appeared much larger in the photograph than it actually is. The structure itself is truelly shabby, however, I suppose you get what you pay for..."
2,Not up to snuff for Chris Bohjalian,"I am one of Chris Bojhalian's biggest fans and was greatly disappointed by this effort of his. He appears, for some reason, to have morphed into a Stephen King type writer in this book. Every writer is entitled to one major mistake and, hopefully, he's gotten his out of his system."
1,Total Junk!,"The manufacturer should be embarrassed to sell such garbage. The in/out threads do not fit standard pipe threads, so you have to use miles of teflon tape for sealing, and even that doesn't last long. The valves themselves leak, and leak, and leak, regardless if you tighten the ring hand-tight or wrench tight. Not just a few drops, but significant amounts of water on a continual basis. I'm no plumbing amateur, and I've never seen such a bad plumbing product. You WILL be sorry you bought this product."
1,"Leaks, Leaks, Leaks","This is the worst Orbit product I ever seen, it leaks since day one. I have 4 in the back yard, they all leak. The FPT on both in and out does not match the threads on PVC fittings, even after you uses 10 layers of Teflon tape. I noticed the leak stops on a hot day, but restart after a cold night. The screw on top cover leaks as well, also temperature related. Very poorly designed. I'm switching to a different brand, different design."
1,TominCA,The Diaphragm lasts about 2 years and then cracks and starts to leak. I bought a new valve to get the parts and noticed that the new diaphragm is clear - mentioned in another review - Hopefully the different material will work better. Meanwhile Orbit has stopped showing parts on their website so I have to call them tomorrow to see if I can get some parts. If you are building a new system get another brand.
2,lousy functionality,"Most sprinkler valves include a mechanism for manually activating the sprinklers without wasting a lot of water around the valve. This one uses a cheap bleed valve that does, indeed, open the valve. But it continuously sprays water all around the valve in the process. This is wasteful and may be harmful if there's anything sensitive to water in the vicinity of the valve. I would not buy this valve again."
3,Not bad,The sound coming out of this piano is rather tin can sounding and not at all what I had expected.
1,the Paris Hilton of Hip-Hop,"this Band is tripping&Ego out of control. volume 1&2 of what? don't you have to have some hits to have a collection?? they have always been the ""HOUSE"" band for other People. that is all they ever are a ""HOUSE"" band for the latest thing. marginal rapping&the same Boring drumming. all that is known about this band is the Afro. nobody buys there records.I use to actual buy there records&then after a while they became like the Spinal tap sort of act to me.overblown&overrrated. I can't control what goes on my magazines that I read,but I pay alot of money on my cable&I Don't like to see Bum Acts hogging up my VH1 soul time. these Cats matter about as much as PM dawn,blacksheep or ME Phi Me or somebody from back in the day. Boring tired generic Band."
3,"Its not as GREAT as the resturant version, but its still good","I had ordered a case of this incredible soup, based on my experience of ordering it at the the Dallas Fort Worth resturant. It was so incredible that I ordered another container to go, couldnt stop thinking about it during my meeting in Dallas and ordered two more before my flight back to California. I went out of my way to go to this terminal so I could order it again.So when I got the canned version....not as impressed. Oh well."
1,"Not Creamy, But Signature","This soup is advertised as ""creamy,"" however when it arrived it was ""signature."" Puck changed the recipe of the Creamy Butternut Squash Soup and is now calling it Signature Butternut Squash Soup. It does not taste the same (and is not as good) as the original recipe."
4,"Tastes good, but not real healthy","I have eaten in various restaurants operated by Wolfgang Puck and have always found the food to be delicious. This soup is no exception. The only problem is that it is exceedingly high in sodium, fat, cholesterol and calories in general. Per servings totals are 200 calories, total fat 11g, saturated fat 8g, cholesterol 30 mg, sodium 540 mg! This sodium total is 22% of what you should get for the whole day! By comparison, Campbell's Chicken with Rice soup has 70 calories, total fat 1.5g, saturated fat .5g, cholesterol 5 mg, sodium 820 mg. Almost double the sodium (salt) but much healthier in every other category. The bottom line is, if you want healthy soup, make it yourself."
3,Going pro? Save for something better.,"I'll be diplomatic and say this isn't a bad camera. But I used to shoot a lot of live events and concerts, and with a DVX100 and a DVC80 to choose from, this camera would always get stuck on the lowest priority shot. It's big, but mostly hollow, so it's almost as light as a Canon ZR series. In sunlight or other bright light, you're fine, but in low light you really know it's a 1-CCD camera. The colors wash out and the picture gets noisy. For a third of the price you could get a consumer level camera (Canon ZR) that'll shoot nearly as well (if not looking as imposing) while you save your pennies for a 3-CCD model."
4,DP,"one of duane peters better records, especially the last song cross bones.And hey mike lohrman of the stitches sings on the wrench."
2,"Doesn't read CF cards, but is fast back-up for computer","I've had this HyperDrive device for >1 yr. It worked about 3-4 times reading CompactFlash cards directly, but has not worked subsequently, in spite of updates on firmware, reformatting HyperDrive, reformatting cards, or buying new cards. OTOH, it is fast (as advertised) for an external hard drive for my Mac laptop. Unfortunately, now I need to still carry my Mac to download pics until I can find some more reliable PSD. I notice that a reviewer of the 160 GB version also reported lack of dependability. I can confirm her notion that the ""instruction manual"" has little to do with the actual device."
4,Good Doggie!,"I've hunted around everywhere for an album like this and it's a pleasure to finally find it. Worth it for Patti Page and Big Mama Thornton alone, you get the extra vittles of Everly Bros and Elvin Bishop, wee haw and pass the dog chow! I could have done without Lobo's ""Boo"" for the thousandth time, but I suppose they had to put it in here, no harm done. David Wilcox and Adam Chester are new to me and real finds, so thanks a lot! It's a treat fit for a pup to have this album. My only regret is it's not twice as long!"
4,The Girl Does Have it Going On!,"Once I starting reading I couldn't stop. Ms. Holeman really grabs your attention with the details of Kenna's love affairs, as well as her affairs of the heart. I'm from Baltimore too and I love to hear references of my own city. It all seemed so real- life not like the ""PC"" Afro-Americans as depicted on TV. The main character Kenna is a strong dark-skinned woman with character, heart, and a passion for life. Her details of Kenna's lovemaking were terrific. I look forward to another erotic tale from Ms. Holeman. I found her work sincere and to the point, not a slow part in the entire book."
1,Everybody Dies,"This book dragged on for too long. It was hard to get into and even harder to finish. There really wasn't much plot or emotion involved, just a lot of killing. He could have done better."
1,First time read of author,I just finished Michael Connelly's fabulous Harry Bosch series and purchased Lawrence Block's Everbody Dies. This book is not a winner. It ambles through the plot becoming very difficult to follow. Hopefully Mr. Block's Matt Scudder character fairs better in earlier outings; this one is plain bad!
5,Hooked on Block,"Yeah, well, he's one of the best. He's got the dialogue thing happening to a ""T."" A master of the wry understatement. I have to say I found Mick Ballou a bit sentimentalized, but still, you can't put down a Matthew Scudder story once you've read the first page. Sorry to sound greedy, but please give us another one, Mr. Block, asap!"
3,"Not bad, not great.","I would recommend this book for fans only. I was actually hoping for something a little darker than this. A few friends of Matt's (and several others) do die, but this novel was lacking the excitement (even with the shootouts) and great writing of the earler books which got me hooked on this series. And I thought the ending (the very last page) was pretty lame. Not a book I would recommend to somebody new to the series, though I look forward to the next one."
3,Lots Of Action But Only A Fair Plot,"In Everybody Dies Lawrence Block provides lots of action but the plot tends to ramble at times, is somewhat disjointed, and is fairly predictible. Overall, Everbody Dies will maintain your interest, although it is not a book that will keep you glued to your seat. Further, it is not in quite the same class as many of the earlier Scudder books -- e.g. When The Sacred Ginmill Closes, A Dance At The Slaughterhouse, and Sins Of The Fathers. Like some other reviewers, I'm starting to be concerned that Block is losing some of his edge in this series. Scudder continues to be one of my favorite fictional characters and I'll remain a loyal reader of this series with the hope that Block will return to his earlier form."
5,Help! I need help from a true-blue Block fan!,"If there is a big Block fan out there, (or Mr. Block himself) perhaps you can help me with a research question. I am looking for a passage from one of the Matthew Scudder novels that is a strong description of police revolvers. I simply can't remember which book it was in. If anyone can help me, I'd be very appreciative. I am writing a novel about a policeman, and I simply need the information contained in that passage, because it is one of the few places I have heard guns described in such a detailed manner. You can e-mail me at femmesage@earthlink.net. Thank you."
4,Even Block's 'less than best' is better than most,"There are no bad Matthew Scudder books. While I agree thatEverybody Dies is not as good as some of the previous Scudder books,Lawrence Block on any bad day can out write almost anyone else doing this kind of thing. There is a familiarity of place, character and action about these books that always satisfies. The writing is spare and evocative and seems perfectly tuned to the violence and the moral ambiguity of the world that Scudder inhabits.I don't know what others sense as lacking in this book, and I doubt that I can put my own impressions clearly, but it seems that as Scudder's domestic scene has become more stable, some edge has been lost from the character. I think I liked it better when his woman was still turning tricks and he seemed more lost and unhappy. It added a dimension to the stories that I miss.Nevertheless, I will continue to read Block's Scudder series as long as he wants to turn them out. They are a fine way to pass a few hours"
3,Autism and Children's Picture Books,"In the school playground an autistic boy named Andy is closely watched by his sister while a new girl, Sarah, attempts to befriend him. However, Andy's autistic behaviours and communication difficulties make it impossible for Sarah to make a friend of him. Through the eyes of children the author works hard to explain autism in simple terms. However, the book is somewhat wordy and it lacks the kind of literary style that captures the interest of children. Nevertheless, fictional picture books about autism are small in number and this book is useful for teachers and parents who wish to use fiction as a starting point for discussing autism with children. Appropriate for ages 6 and up."
2,Disturbing ending,"I found the content of this book to be excellent, particularly for older children. That is, until I got to the last page or so. As an educator of children with autism I found the ending quite disturbing. The sister in the story explains autism very sweetly to the girl, then takes the girl away from her brother to play with her herself. The book seemed to me to indirectly teach children that if you come across a child with autism it is best to ignore them because they have no interest in you. A much more appropriate ending would in fact be to have the sister teach the girl how to interact with her brother appropriately."
2,A stereotypical view of autism,"As a parent of an autistic son, I was very disappointed that this book was an example of one face of autism only; that of an aloof, non-verbal child who spins. It would be quite beneficial and helpful in a classroom with a non-verbal autistic child. For parents searching for a book to share with siblings, I would recommend something else."
1,Blah - Weak - Poorly written,"The cover intro states this book is ""heartwarming."" It is not. There is no resolve. The cover also states ""... a disability that can be particularly confusing to those who know little about it."" Certainly a valid point. But this book does nothing to even sort of maybe kind of clairfy that confusion."
1,Children's literature,"I am sure the author of this book was well meaning, but I do not like the book at all. The child with autism does make a friend of sorts, but the portrayal is too negative and sterotypical. There are some children with autism like the main character, but I fear that young children might overgeneralize. There are better books out there to include in your library, keep looking!"
2,Over priced,"I gave this book to my husband who worked on nuclear submarines. He said the book was ok for someone that knew nothing about nuclear submarines, otherwise for someone like him it had nothing of real interest. I cannot understand why the price of this book was so high, over $80, it was nothing special."
3,Mediocre,"This book has the requisite basic stuff - a bit of sub history, sub basics, with a heavy bias towards US stuff. I think I saw the Surcouf (French sub) being mentioned once, but. If you see mentions of Russian subs, you get much the same jibe as Tom Clancy - Russian subs are noisy, deaf and leaky, which is not particularly informative.Except for the basics, the material is heavily biased towards the reactor. The 2nd most detailed section is about TMA. Navigation, tactics ... etc get kind of snuffed.Reading it with the heavy reactor emphasis, I couldn't help but remember the less pleasant stereotypes of American submariners, as in ""Rickoverized""."
2,Misleading marketing!,"I was searching for a book that would explain the basics of just what a submarine is and how it works. This book is not it. I was extremely disappointed that there were next to none pictures or diagrams of the workings of a sumarines innards. I wanted to learn how a submarine is designed, the mechanics of it. This offered little tidbits, and some interesting first person experiences, but nothing that would have made me purchase this book had I the chance to have a look at it in a store before purchasing it.I often felt that it skirted the real subject because of security issues as it spends most of its explinations on nuclear submarines. But what I really wanted to know was nowhere to be found within the pages of this book.After one read through I am donating to my College Library. Maybe somebody else will find solace in it."
1,32 inches in daimeter?,"I've read the excerpt ""Water in the people tank"" and it seems to be very well written and informative with one exception. A submarine hull is not 32 inches in diameter (that equates to 2 feet 8 inches, pretty small) it is 32 FEET in diameter, to allow for the 3 decks of living/operational and engineering space inside the submarine."
4,Why $150?,"I have been able to view this book.It is a very easy ready and you get a sense of reality on a submarine.BUT! IT COST $150 NEW!I went to EBay and saw someone who had put it up for auction for $800.Excuse me?Are there state secrets in the book we should know about.I am totally amazed.I will never buy the book at this price.But honestly, Could someone please tell me why it's so expensive?Thanks"
5,"Consistently good, varied melodic gems",Power-pop aficionados...you need to listen to this one. Period.
5,a good read,"If you like jazz but don't know why, this book will help you explain it. If you don't know if you like jazz, it will tell you whom you should listen to. If you are sure you like jazz, you will like the book for showing how important music can be in a life. It is a very entertaining combo of music and autobiography."
1,did not like key,I did not like the key of the music and it was really old and musty.I was not happy with it at all.
4,"Gorgeous, like its predecessor",Beautiful arrangements... you will love this if you loved Hips and Makers.
4,"A must-have companion to Hersh's ""Hips and Makers""","This is a collection of several songs from Kristin's album ""Hips and Makers"" arranged for strings. In some cases, while the sound is pleasing, the arrangements worked better for me in some of the ""calmer"" songs like ""Velvet Days."" There are also three other tracks, including a cover of ""When the Levee Breaks""."
3,My random comments,"Though I didn't like the ending (don't ask me why)I believe it is a good reading. There was a feeling of reading a Cain or Chandler or Hammett novel.I wonder if the average reader went through all the scientific details?BTW, an earlier critic comments the title of the book (the Hindenberg was not a phoenix, etc.) Who said the title is about the ship and not about the principal character? A book should be read up to the end before doing a critic...An historical novel makes you learn a lot, but it is hard to distinguish facts from fiction. Maybe an appendix in this book would have helped? And watch the philosophical ideas in it!Yes, I do recommend the book to anybody interested, maybe only vaguely like me, by this Titanic of the air."
4,"Good, but ...","I really like Power Pop, but it is a retro style that practically never moves into new musical territory. Ray Paul was quite popular in the Boston area in late 70s, but he never had a national hit. His major problem is that his studio tracks sound sterile due to overproduction. He is joined by Emitt Rhodes on the new recording ""Some Sing, Some Dance,"" which starts off great, but the lead guitar just sounds too polished to me. I wish he would have cranked up his amp and let it rip. I'm surprised it doesn't sound better, since Rhodes engineered the track too. The live cover of ""Telegram Sam"" sounds great and that sound is what's missing in his studio recordings."
5,Protects Baby Born from the cold!!!!!!,Baby Born is meant to go in water but I don't think she likes getting rained on. Keep her from getting wet with this rain outfit. She'll appreciate it. I don't own a single Baby Born toybut I will once I earn over a hundred dollars. I live in Canada (...)
3,Hollywood version?,I didnt know that it was a Hollywood version of that beautiful movie. What a shame! I think the Bollywood version it s such way much better. And I noticed because I saw the original one. Looks like its something missing in the movie. I had to explain to the others why certain things happened. Looks like discontinuous sequences. Where is the scene with the dance with J. and Julia (the girl who danced with him at the Dance Contest?) i dont understand why they deleted that gorgeous scene. And they added the love scene! for what? i felt disappointed!I really thought you were sending me the Original version (the next time im gonna write it down this: I WANT THE ORIGINAL MOVIE MADE IN INDIA)Thanks any way.:(S.G.
2,"Watch the trailer , you will not miss the movie : disappointment for Hritik Fans","Watching the trailer is much better than watching the whole movie. You will not miss anything if u have watched the trailer.Very disappointing for Hrithik Fans.Generally Hrithik movie has style , Songs , Dance and action sequences . You will miss all in this movie . ... See MoreThere is a just 1 dance sequence for 10 mins and Hrithik did a good job . but , that's it ...don't expect music from the movie .As a Hrithik fan , I was disappointed by the story line too."
2,"Great actors, slick film, poor script.",I love these actors but I did not like this script. I felt like the script set me up for one ending and delivered another that didn't make sense.
2,Same sort of failure...,"Well , I think that this trial of making a film by a indian producer , with some indian actors , including a big star , using the occidental way of making movies didn't result at all . As a BD or even a DVD the product is very good . Hrithik Roshan continues to be one of the biggest dancers in India , but nothing more . The story is absolutely boring."
1,Blind Faith,"I am trying to find out the author's name. Based on your reviews I would like to purchase ""Blind Faith>"""
2,Very early 70's B Movie.,"Not worth more than a dollar at the dollar store. The film quality was poor, worth watching for the blonde that was on Hee Haw."
2,"Not a bad book, but there are better!","I found Christianity 101 to be rather a tedious reading book written from a clearly neo-evangelical perspective. Provided that one affirms that position, he or she may find this book useful. Perhaps my principal concern is that this book was written for the newer Christian who may not be aware of other positions. Bilezikian often argues in such a manner that the reader would assume his perspective is unassailable, when in fact he simply fails to note arguments to the contrary. This tendency is particularly noticeable in his dealings with eschatology. In this regard, the widely held conservative envangelical position is dealt with in an almost disdainful manner.In sum, there are other books available which are more academically neutral (and, I would say, honest)."
3,Not the best book I've read,"This book is OK, but it isn't that good. l thought it was confusing and hard to read. But a few chapters were fantastic! lt could have been better, but it was a pretty good book."
2,Christianity101,Was very disappointed in the condition of the book. It was written and drawn in to the point it was hard to read. Will not order from that supplier again.
5,Favorite bracelet,"This bracelet is very shiny, lightweight, and can be worn with anything. I was expecting a small bracelet in which I would have to buy an extender for it, but it fits my wrist perfectly. Perfect for the Naruto fangirl or fan of the series itself."
4,Pretty Sweet.,"I like this bracelet. It was for my girlfriend and I think it looks hot. I would not buy it for myself like I accidentally did, because it looks like it was made for girls. (which is why I gave it to my GF)"
5,Great Fun!,"She makes the ""every day"" world so funny. You come away feeling better for having watched her videos."
3,Why doesn't it last long?,"My husband bought this perfume for me 4 years ago in the Nex. I was looking for this many years later. Finally , I saw it at Amazon, but I don't think I like it as much as the one that my husband gave me. It doesn't last long . What's the problem?"
3,"Good for non-accountants, but could use more on healthcare specifics","For someone who knows little about accounting and finance, it provides a good overview with a slant towards healthcare. Throughout the book, there are sidebars that provide a good perspective of what healthcare organizations are really doing and the issues facing the healthcase industry.For someone who knows accounting and finance, but is new to the healthcare industry, only a third of the book deals with specific healthcare finance issues. The book also seems to be written from a payor's perspective of provider finance, but maybe it's just the nature of the healthcare industry overall. Also, this book was updated in 2003, and given the dynamic nature of the healthcare industry, some topics may not be current."
1,horrible book with poor examples,"We used this book for our introductory finance class, and I hated it. Perhaps it's just the outdated edition, but I found that the excercises at the end of each chapter were awful. The book does a poor job of explaining difficult concepts. The book is also boring and drab illustrations. There has to be a better book out there. I quickly sold my edition of this book, as it is terrible."
3,3 Full Moon movies edited down.,"This is a fun little DVD. If you have already seen Prison Of The Dead, The Killer Eye and Totem, go ahead and skip this as they are the movies that are contained on this disc. Otherwise, if you in for some super-cheap, low budget entertainment or are a diehard Full Moon fan, I highly recommend this!"
1,Disappointed,This soup has no flavor. Broth had a slimy consistency instead of a liquid-y one. I was so disappointed.
1,"Product is fine, but the price is more than at the grocery store!",I can get this at my local grocery store for $2.69 per can ($32.28 for 12).
2,not tasty or satisfying,"A waste of $. and calories. :(I bought a can at a nearby natural foods market yesterday. Just ate it for dinner tonight and boy was it completely unimpressive. The only redeeming quality is that it contains free-range chicken, therefore i gave a VERY generous 2 stars.This ""soup"" consisted of 2 little square pieces of chicken, about 2 spoonfuls of rice, 7 carrot pieces and lots of blandish pooky tasting broth. I will never buy this crap or eat it again. The best part about it was the packet of wendy's saltines that i added. I wish i had thrown it out & eaten something else. Why did i finish it? hrmpphhh..."
2,Ick,"This soup is just offensive. Why does it taste like cinnamon? Also, it's twice the price of Campbell's and 1/4 the chicken. Sure, it says it's organic. I totally believe that, don't you?"
1,"""The worst thing I've ever tasted""","In court, as I understand it, you're not supposed to testify about anything where you don't have direct experience. You can discount this review if you want, since I have only second hand experience with this soup.I gave a case of this soup to a young friend who is a college student (I worry about her starving). She never mentioned whether she liked the soup, so I asked. She finally admitted that it was, to quote her, ""The worst thing I've ever tasted"". Apparently her boyfriend also tried it and thought it was bad as well. While my friend is rather picky, her boyfriend has a much wider culinary range, so if they both disliked the soup, I'm inclinded to think it's not very good."
3,Just another potpourri book...,"I love interior decorating books, especially Colonial, Regency and Victorian or English Country Style. But this book covers too much territory. A few pictures of each, as well as others styles like Ranch, or French. If you are having trouble deciding on a style, this book might help you. It has lovely illustrations, but again, as it is trying to cover many different styles falling under the broad title of ""Country"" your information is limited. There are too many books coming out like this. Specialty books are much better. Look to Rizzoli for the best in interior decorating books, or if you want some kind of country, best buy a book that covers that one particular style. I browsed through this at the store, hoping it might make a good Christmas present for me, but it ended up back on the shelf."
3,So So,"This book was a bit disapointing. The disappointment comes from the intrepetation of Country style or English country style, as shown the the photographs, as being lots of clutter and in some cases not the best of taste. I have many other style books that show how charming Country style, antiques and hodge podge collections can be, but somehow many of the examples in this book miss the mark. Maybe the author's take on Country style is just not my cup of country tea, so to speak. Many photos are from the author's own home and I felt that narrowed the scope of the book somewhat."
2,Ho-hum,"In my opinion, this book did not ""live up to"" it's cover. Too many of the rooms looked very dated. I love the idea of collecting over time but many of these rooms were very lackluster and boring. I requested it as a Christmas gift and wish I could un-request it!"
2,Fooled by the cover,"I was greatly fooled by the cover of this book. I expected the photographs to be similar. White country cottage it is not. If you are looking for white country cottage or shabby chic, this is not the book for you."
4,Prophecy for Profit,"Fun book. Written in British slang for British audience; the American version of English kind of got in the way, but otherwise lots of good ideas and practical suggestions."
1,Falls short of a B movie...,This falls quite short of a b movie and also falls way short of direct to video... Not very good....
5,This movie is crazy,"This movie is ridiculous and definitely defines what would happen if Tim and Eric got $1,000,000,000. 5/5 for Tim and Eric's crazy humor."
5,Stellar,"This film is pure Tim and Eric, so if you don't like it, you don't _really_ like them. They have improved my life immensely and I loved the film for what it was: a natural extension of their perfect brand of duo-comedy. Keep it up guys, your work is an important part of my life."
1,Absolute garbage with no humor,"This movie was almost literally painful to watch. I waited for it to get better, but it somehow managed to just get worse. It is amazing that I can't even think of one good thing to say about it. Thank goodness it wasn't longer. I think it could very well be the worst movie I have ever seen. It isn't just bad, but even in the weird and bizarre scenes it amazingly fails to be interesting. Absolute garbage pretty well sums it up, except that is probably being to kind to this movie (or perhaps unfair to actual garbage). I really wanted to give it zero stars."
1,Awful!,"these people are terrible, i can't believe anyone would give them money to produce this crap! utterly juvenile humor not worth the time it took to read this review!"
1,more of the same,I wish I could give this zero stars just more of the same stuff over and a better use of time would be sleep the day away or stare at a blank screen or write really long reviews about really bad stuff
1,"Although better than Lorax, how did this movie win an Oscar???","I was told this 3D movie would be about a paraplegic Marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission who becomes torn between following his orders and protecting the world he feels is his home. Even though the 2 main characters were definitely handicapped, no one ever went to the moon. This was the worst 3D movie I have ever seen, after The Lorax!!!"
2,Not for me,"I first saw Tim and Eric on TV with their ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"" show. I liked the absurd nature of it. I watched ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job!"" as well, but after a few episodes, I felt like the show was just repedative and I failed to get the humor of it, so I stopped watching.These days, I'm able to spot Tim & Eric's work even if they're not in it, e.g. John C. Reilly & Will Ferrell's ""Animal Choices."" For me, Tim and Eric have been making the same sketch over and over and over...I watched ""Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie"" for FREE and with no expectations.In my opinion, its just a movie length version of ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job!""So, if you like the show ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job!"" you will probably enjoy ""Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie""But its not for me. I paid NOTHING to see it and wished I had spent the time doing something else."
1,I want my money back...,"Everyone that suffered through any of this lame, idiotic excuse for a film should be paid $1,000,000,000 for every minute they watched. In my case I made it through to 7 minutes & 12 seconds. Probably a record. I want my $7,200,000,000 NOW!!!Is this really suppposed to be funny????????????"
2,Alright Already,"At about the 15 minute mark one of two things stopped me watching this:1) A shrieking, agonizing pain in my ribs. The constant, insistent, nudge-nudge, ""ain't we ironic and witty comic geniuses"" elbows finally did their damage, or ...2) Appearances by Zach Galifianakis, Jeff Goldblum, Will Ferrell and (not) Johnny Depp depressed me so much I needed to lie down and think of the good work that they have done - in any movie except this one. (Actually the scenes by Galifianakis, Goldblum and Ferrell were the high points of the movie - from there on it wasn't just downhill it was Olympic downhill with rockets strapped to your back.)Save your money and skip this drivel, or, if you're like me watching it 'free' as part of Amazon Prime, your time.P.S. Robert Loggia still says that eleven-letter word better than anyone this side of Chris Rock. And yes, he is better than the rest of the film as well.P.P.S. Hack Cinema 101 - if you suck, have someone else in your movie that doesn't suck."
2,BOO!,"Before I watched this, I started out with a five star rating. I started subtracting stars from it as I was watching. I ended up with two stars after subtracting three stars because of the reasons mentioned below.-1 star for the graphic penis piercing scene.-1 star for the nauseating sex scene with Twink Caplan (there was no nudity, but I felt really gross watching it).-1 star for Robert Loggia's terrible character and third-rate acting!There were a few laugh-out-loud scenes, so it is worth a two star rating. I am a huge Tim and Eric fan, but this was a terrible idea with a terrible outcome. After opening the package and watching the movie once, this movie has absolutely no value."
1,Don't see The Lorax,The Lorax looks bad. Don't waste your money on The Lorax. Go see Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie instead.
2,save your time.,"This movie is not great, ok at best. The ending is junk. You have to really be into this type of movie to enjoy it at all. save your time and pick a different indy. blah"
1,Degenerate,"Not even going to waste any time writing anything and hope my one star brings the rating down and, no, I only skimmed through this just to see how low people can go. Not funny. Not satirical. Just degenerate. 0 stars."
1,This movie was retarded!,"This movie is a complete waste of time! They actually show some guy getting his junk pierced and even if it was a fake one, who wants to see that? Stupid movie, end of story!"
5,Tim And Eric BDM,Amazing must see for all tim and eric fans. all though it does not follow the tim and eric show it has its own amazing sense of direction and harmony.
3,Conventional farce surprises long-time fans,"Tim and Eric's TV show was a loose, absurdist, psychedelic rollercoaster of freakish filth...but ""Billion Dollar Movie"" is much more conventional in structure and execution. Mostly set in a run-down shopping mall, the thin premise of the film is punctuated by a few absurd visual gags and strange supporting characters. The budget likely factored into what they could do, and perhaps they just didn't want to repeat what they had done with ""Awesome Show - Great Job!"" Would have loved to have seen a much wackier effort, given the cast...but at the same time, impressed they got the thing made."
2,Dissapointing,"I've been a fan of Tim & Eric's work for many years. This had some funny moments, but lacked the spontaneous and creative humor we've come to expect from them. If I had it to do over I would have waited till it was available for much less than the 9.99 for the pre release viewing. Oh well, they have my money. Maybe it'll help them get that billion they are after."
5,Very convenient to use,My grandchild wanted to start sitting up in a seat instead of lying down when she went for a walk in the Bugaboo Cameleon stroller. My daughter bought this adapter to use with her Graco car seat and it works great. The adapter is very easy to use and now my grandchild sits in her Graco car seat while out for a walk with this stroller. This ability to easily convert from bassinet to car seat with a simple adapter is very convenient for the Bugaboo Cameleon.
4,love love love..but it's alittle expensive,Love this feature. is so great to just carry the car seat around. But I feel like it's so expensive. We only used the infant car seat for 3 months.
5,BelCanto Thomastic Gold,"I have played professionally for many years. The C and G strings are the best strings by far I have ever put on my cello. I have an early 1800s (German) cello with a warm and powerful sound. Belcanto Gold increased the power and warmth. The articulation and response on all the strings is excellent, with much less tension. I am also pleased with the D, but I prefer a different sound on the D and A. Interestingly, the A was a bit strident for me while playing Bb to F#. On the A when playing a D and above, it sounds quite wonderful.So....the C and G......NO doubt, the best I have ever played. The D...extremely good, but my personal preference for MY cello is Eva Parazzi on the D and A. However....for some concerts...I would keep the Belcanto Gold D."
5,Excellent service,"Shipping fruit is a tricky business. You can't ship when they are too ripe or they rot and if you ship them when they aren't ripe they don't quite have the taste of the ripened on the tree fruit. Lychees aren't readily available and so I tried Melissa's fruit. The box was well packed and there were just fruit. No leaves, twigs or other dead weight that you often get when buying Lychees. The fruit were shipped at a perfect time. Firm enough to make the journey and ripe enough to eat once the arrived. As I leave this review, I'm ordering another batch."
5,Rohna Memories- Eyewitness to Tragedy,"I found the writer's angle very different than the usual ""just the facts"" history book. The story of this horrible event is told through the men that were there. Like most eyewitness accounts, their stories are different and even sometimes contradict each other. I found the stories very touching. The fact that over 1000 men could die from one bomb and then be kept secret for 50 years is amazing. So many mothers, fathers, wives and family members never knew. This book transports you back in time."
5,Best yet,This is her best cd yet. I can't wait to get her 5th cd later this year. Seeing her in concert is a must.
4,oki OK,It was shipped in good condition and timing was just right.And most importantly it was the right product.
3,"Cute patterns, but get ready to work!","This kit works fine, but it's a lot of work to come up with a good pumpkin. You have to saw away with a tiny knife that doesn't have a very ergonomic handle. In my 20s I probably would not have noticed or cared, but detail work is a bit harder for me now that I'm in the 40s and have a little tendonitis! Anyway, you have to have a lot of patience for most of the designs, but the book does include a few simpler faces if you are really afraid to freehand it but want something easy. Some of the tiny knives can be a little frustrating to work with too, and we found ourselves hauling out a bigger kitchen knife for some of the less precise cutting. All in all, if you must have fancy Jack-o-lantern, this kit is fine. But if you would be happy with a simple carving, you can do just as well with a kitchen knife and a little imagination."
2,Came wet in container.,"The sealed salt bag was wet inside and when the salt was placed in a grinder for use, it would not grind because it was so soggy."
2,Wrong Size,"The size of the tissues were not what I wanted, to small to use in a car visor. Should be made clear that these are not to be used for the car tempo case refills."
2,Cute but a Downer,"We all know that pregnancy means getting big and awkward, and that we'll need more support from our friends and families. This book, though, rather than cheering me through the hard parts, just ticked me off. For all the feisty attitude, there is a depressing, sexist feel to these 125 Things. I acknowledge that making yourself look good can help you feel good, but for goodness' sakes, why waste energy caring about shaving your legs when you're using all your resources to nurture a baby? Instead, I'd like some advice or guidance that helps me feel good about being exhausted and swept up in such rapid physical changes.Just pass this one by. Surely there is a more confident or positive humorous guide to pregnancy out there."
5,A complete surprise!,"I bought this , as well as a few other books about pregnancy, for my daughter-inlaw who just found out she was pregnant. She called to say that this was her favorite! Apparently it is just good for the pregnant soul....Pick it up!"
2,"To expensive, but cute (borrow it)","I borrowed my copy from the library. It was cute, but not worth the money period. This would be cute to read say in a the obgyn waiting room. It's not something you want to spend the money to ship and wait for this in the mail. If you think it's cute for a friend get it from the library, read the book, get some ideas and make your own."
3,Any horse lover would love this collection.,"I am a horse lover and so music about them gets my attention. This album has two of my all time favorites on it and that in it's self is a reason for me to get it. The others are a wonderful addition and opens you up to other artists. I highly recommend this to those who love horses and other animals. Life without children, animals and music would be a boring life indeed. Have fun and enjoy."
2,All you need is piece of magnet and a thread,All you need is piece of magnet and a thread. Connect the other end with a clip. You are all set to save $15
5,Essential item for replacing lost treadmill key!,I was given a used treadmill that did not have this key so I purchased one here on Amazon. It fit my treadmill and I have been able to get some use out of it. This was definitely worth the money to enable me too use my treadmill. I would recomend this to anyone that has gotten a treadmill without the key or maybe have lost the key that came with it. Great product!
1,Treadmill Key,"This key did not work. I was very disappointed because I gave the manufactor the right model number of the treadmill, purchase the key and to my disappointment, the key did not work. My treadmill is sitting in my garage still not working."
2,Does not work with an Imagine 10.0,I bought it because it said that it would work for the Imagine and it looked like the same key I had before. When I got it home it would not work. I was to big and would not even go in the slot. Just don't by it for the Imagine 10.0 cause it does not work.
4,very useful,I got this in a very quick and timely manner it was exactly what i ordered thank you very much.
3,You don't need this key,Just cut a cardboard to same size and gently stick it in. It'll work just as fine. No need to spend 15$!
5,awesome,Just what I was looking for! I lost my treadmill key a while ago and I spent 3 months unable to use my treadmill (sad because I used it almost daily). I am sooo glad to be able to work out again!
2,only for extreme novices,"if you know nothing about cubase, basic recording/mixing techniques and very little about computers, this book might be for you, otherwise i would recommend looking elsewhere. this book has very little useful information about the actual usage of cubase."
3,56,"it is funny: this book is good either for beginners, or practically oriented adventurers for when they realize somethings are not working the way they want. it may help you optimize vst so that you may ""fine tune"" it. or if you are a beginner learn a lot by going thru, as it gives a good discussion of several technical topics. definitely not for figuring out how to make music with vst."
2,I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I AM SORRY I TOOK THE TIME TO READ THIS ONE,"I like Conan, I like Howard and I like many of the authors who have taken the story line and added to the adventures of Conan. This book was an exception. I have to agree with a couple of the other reviewers here that were not all that thrilled over this work. One stated that it was simply silly. I think the reviewer was being overly kind here. Perry is indeed capable of readable work, but he was certainy off the mark with this one. I gave this one two stars simply because it was a Conan story and I have a certainly loyality to the big lug. Overall, do not recommend this work."
1,Conan the Unreadable,"Without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. Perry has written good Conan books, like Conan the Fearless and Conan the Defiant, although this one was just plain silly. I can't believe this material was actually put into print."
3,lots of great ideas but he doesn't fight worm or cyclops,"Lots of great ideas here. Witches sorcerors.. caves, worms bats jui-jitsu monk cursed tree even a unique monster under an other curse...read it its good fist 10 pages stink then it rokz"
3,An interesting book,An interesting book with interviews and informations about all the shows produced by Quinn Martin and the people implicated in their creation. Damage there are no more photos and behind-the-scene shot.
5,book,purchased this as a gift for fathers day. interesting reading....good stories. very entertaining. I would reccomend it for a great gift idea for anyone who likes fishing.
2,The writer looks like an amateur to me.,It is a cheap book. The stories were not told in a professional way. I lost my interest after reading a couple of them and never came back.
2,Incredible fish stories,"Boring. I have better fish stories. But I do like the author's other book, wahoo rhapsody and have Preordered his next book, el dorado blues."
1,Old,The best way to say that this book is about old stories. Nothing at all current. Not worth the time it took to read old out dated stories.
4,Must Have,"Nice tool to have. Works well the O-Ring is a bit chancy to use, the only thing holding it back from 5 stars"
3,Cute but not astute,"This book would not do for a young person who actually wants to learn some history, as the history aspect is done just a little too ""lite"". Here's a paragraph describing the Norman Conquest: ""Bill the Conqueror was Norman leader in 1066. He said King Edward of England had promised him the English throne --King Harold said the same thing."" [You see the problem there with the indefinite antecedent.] ""It was a fight to the death for two tough fellers. The English must have hoped Harold would win because Big Bill was bloodthirsty..."" The above is actually okay for the British teenagers for whom it was originally written, but a young American audience would be unlikely to deduce the basic facts of the Norman Conquest from the author's account. It is, however, funny, likely to hook a reluctant reader, and seems to have been enjoyed by the young people who reviewed it here."
2,Freakin' hot (not the good hot),"Costume is hot. Like all polyester costumes, this is already uncomfortable, but the muscle chest really traps the heat and makes it too hot to wear at room temperature for any length of time. The cowl and cape are one piece so if you plan on using a different mask plan on buying a separate cape as well. The belt is jus fabric that ties in the back. I followed the Rubies sizing chart and purchased the medium which proved to be too short; if you are 5' 7"" make sure to order the large."
4,Swish & Flick,"My kids are obsessed with all things magic. My oldest son (4) received a ""magic"" wand as a gift, and this immediately became the object of desire for my 2 year old. What do to but buy another wand?This toy fit the bill perfect. The price is right, and my two year old gets a huge kick of pushing the button & waving his wand - he even tries to immitate the sound ""swishhhhhh""."
3,Not bad for 5 bucks,"Ordered two of these for our kids for stocking stuffers.One didn't work however.Probably going to return it but Amazon only offers refunds on orders fullfilled by Amazon and not replacements,Since we ordered it with a $90+ order the shipping was free , and to order another one with the refund it's going to cost me shipping charges since it will be under $25 , doesnt seem worth it for a $5.10 toy.Will try to buy the replacement from a direct vendor . or look for somehting similar at some of the local stores . The kids love the working one though , worth the 5.10 alone but for the $8 or so it would probably cost if you were paying shipping cost too I'd just shell out the extra money and buy one of the Noble Collection illuminating wands instead personally."
5,Harry Potter in the House,"This wand is best purchase for the price. I bought this for my 4yr old son for his birthday and he has not put it down yet..even has to sleep with it. The sound when he preforms his ""magic"" makes the wand ten times more fun for him. Durable too..he nor the dog are not the gentlest with toys. Great addition to the Harry P. accessories."
5,Good Fun,"This toy was delivered on time and was exactly as described in the advertising. It was also economical, very sturdy and easy to use. My grandson loved the look and feel of it, the light at the end of the wand feature and the swooshing sound when using it. Great gift for a 5-year old."
4,Fun entertainment for your wizard,"My daughter wanted to be a wizard for Halloween and when we saw this wand on Amazon, that's the one she wanted. It came fast (two days regular shipping) and the batteries are included (which is nice since they require 3 button type batteries). She cast spells all over the house the first day and loved the swooshing sound and the red light at the tip (not white like in the photo). After about two hours of play, the button she pushed to make it light up stopped working, and I wondered if she had broken it already, or if the batteries had already worn out. But all I had to do was open the battery compartment, take out the batteries, put them back in, and it worked again. I think there just must have been a loose connection somewhere because now it works fine again. It is a simple plastic wand, sturdy, not fancy, but she likes it. She is really excited to be a wizard with this wand, along with the $2 wizard hat we ordered from Amazon and a cloak she already had."
5,Excellent value,"Well worth the price. Unlike some of the Harry Potter wands, this one actually looks like a wand (rather than a club). Wood-tone, flashing light on the tip and a very satisfying ""WHOOSH!"" noise when casting spells. My daughter has turned me into a ferret about 1,000 time and it isn't close to Halloween yet."
3,Magicians wand,My grandson wanted a magic kit and it didn't have a wand. This fit the bill and it makes noise and lights up which made it more fun.
1,the battery was dead,"It sucked the battery was dead so was gutted, I forget to check it, gave it as a present - what a let down :("
1,Ugh,"Having to read this book for a class and write a comprehensive review proved to be nearly impossible. this is a book consisting of 18 chapters which do not fit together, they resemble 18 seperate short stories. the book is arranged chronologically by the dates of exploration, not by the historical dates which each city, settlement or advancement in civilization occured which makes forming a timeline of history in ones head nearly impossible. Beyone the content, the book consists of many multiple idea sentences and paragraphs, which make the reader repeatedly stop and ask, ""what?""All in all, I would have quit after the 3rd chapter (figured i had to give it a chance) if i wasn't required to write a book report on the ENTIRE book"
4,The only way to fix my Kenmore Power Miser 153.327564,"The lower 5500W element on my Kenmore ""Power Miser 9+"" shorted out after 11 yrs. The tank (not sure if it has the Duron plastic coated inside) is holding up fine and the upper element is clean, so I went looking for a replacement element. Sears wanted ~$60 for this part. This ""Duron style"" element has the unusual 1 3/8 thread.My old element looks like SS where this element is more shiny like Chrome plated.Not sure how this 4500 watt element qualifies as Low Watt Density since its several inches shorter than the original 3800 watt element. Since its shorter and runs hotter, I opted to install it in the upper position, and put the original 3800 watt upper element in the lower position. Interested to hear any expertise/feedback if I was wrong to do that. Anyway, it works and saved me ~$40 so I'm happy."
2,Simply unpleasant,"Being a keen viewer of MTV's ""JACKASS"" I was curious to see this snippet from the second in command.Although I can't say why anyone watches it, you just find that you can't help but look (though sometimes from behind the sofa!!).This video is no exception. My only complaint is that it's a little short but then again there's only so long that one person can torture himself in front of the cameras.There an uncensored bit on the DVD which has to been seen to be believed. Not for a weak stomach so be warned. There are some things a man should not do with a staple gun!!!Summary: Wait to see it on TV."
2,Dude..where did it all go wrong?,"This is the story of what a decadent rich kid does whith his time. Yes that's right. Steve-o's pops is rich.Put that way it's rather pathetic the way this guy disrespects life on all levels. The guy will be dead by 30. That's not a joke either. it's like watching someone self-destruct. A train wreck of a brain-damaged punch drunk ""stunt man.""Stories of coke binges, morhpine injections (not to mention injecting alcohol) and careless sexual encounters leave Steve-o looking less like a comedic fool as MTV portrays him and more like a plain-ol jerk.I hope this guy doesn't pro-create."
2,Very Disappointed!!!!,I was very disappointed with this dvd. I read a few reviews that it was good so I decieded to buy it. I wasted 20 bucks and I was mad. It is very short. about 52 minutes for the entire thing. Including the career ender. No special features. I thought they would have made it longer or at least put some real special features to make it longer but no. After seeing this I will not be buying the other steve-o movies and I am a fan of jackass. Do not pick this up. Boring!!!!
5,All I can say is... eww!!...,"This DVD is both brilliant and gross. It has only just been released over here (England) and when it was released you had to be 18+ to buy it. I was wondering why, until I bought it and saw what was in it. The first section of the DVD is OK but when I saw 'The Career Ender' I was almost sick. It is so gross and I would advise all viewers not to eat before watching it. It is 100% uncensored, stupid and disgusting, yet very hilarious. A must for die-hard Jackass fans, but don't see this if you think Jackass is a little sick- this is ten times worse."
4,Not Too Shabby,"This DVD, in my opinion, was not too bad, overall. The first part of the DVD was relatively unimpressive, just due to the fact that many of the stunts that Steve-O performed had been seen before (such as him hurling himself off the edge of a building into the unsuspecting pool below). It was the more behind-the-scenes footage that tickled me. I found everything after the initial portion of the DVD very amusing. Steve-O setting himself aflame was of course interesting viewing as was a dog eating Steve-O's used condom. I would recommend this DVD to Steve-O, Jackss, CKY fans or anyone that likes some out-of-the-norm fun. Good times."
5,Steve O Is The Man,If you don't already own this dvd get it now. Its one of the funniest dvd's i have ever seen. Great stunts and tons of bonus footage. the comedy of this just never gets old. Plus its way more extreme than jackass and cky. And its not censored like the jackass dvd's.
2,Just alright,I probably don't have to say much but hey its all about Steve-O need I say more. It is interesting but I was very disapointed on the length of it. Not long at all. It wasn't worth what I spent on it but I love Steve-O so whatever I will get over it. It is basically him just doing stupid thing that really I have already seen him do. If you have seen any of the shows or the movies Jackass he does some of the same things on this. Also there is some stuff that he has done on Steve-O Out On Bail and also some from the Wildboyz. I would say though if you like Steve-O and the [...] he does buy it. Personaly I think the best work he has done is the show Wildboyz. I have all the seasons on dvd and I highly recomend anyone that is a fan to buy those. But hey its up to you.
2,Yamaha provides a good base product but fails to deliver the overall quality,"The keyboard itself seems great, but Yamaha fails to go the extra mile. Items that would seem like no-brainers are not included in the package (including a power adapter, audio/data cables, or even batteries). Basically, the failure to include a power supply renders the product inoperable out-of-the-box. These items would have been inexpensive to include and would have paid for themselves many times over in terms of customer satisfaction and loyalty. If you buy this product, be forewarned that you will at least need a 12v power adapter or 6 D-cell batteries for it to even function."
2,Decent but not great,"1. This is one of those movies that has great potential but fell well short largely due to the constraints of trying to tell a complex story within a short period of time etc... Essentially, in my mind, there simply wasn't enough character development and thus the movie was too superficial for me to get really into; translation, it was a pretty boring movie.2. Overall, this is probably worth viewing... once for those who are interested in this topic, however one would be much better off reading the various books out there on this issue."
1,Has nothing to do with the book,This movie is not at all like the book. Most of the movie was filmed in sugar cane fields so there is not even nice scenery.
5,LOved it!,"It was a very good movie reminded me of a book I read not to long ago called ""Honolulu"" by Alan Brennert. I highly recommend both."
4,Useful study of Japanese Picture Brides,"After viewing the video, my 3rd time, I was struck by the difference of today's immigrants experience and those of the Japanese in the early 1920's. Viewing the video for an Asian American studies class, the vivid imagery of the movie along with the touching dialogue, ""The Picture Bride,"" hit home what it really meant to be a picture bride. Marrying a man 20 years your senior, an idea that strikes most of us as digusting, but regardlessly, the movie captures the heart of the era of the Japanese Picture Brides."
3,"WITHOUT -- ""Without you"" !","From 1969 to 1974 Nillson had 10 songs chart.This C.D. contains 7 of those 10.1. ""Everybody's talkin'"" -- 1969.2. ""I guess the Lord must be in New York city"" -- 1969.3. ""Me and my arrow"" -- 1971.4. ""Jump into the fire"" -- 1972.5. ""Coconut"" -- 1972.6. ""Spaceman"" -- 1972.7. ""Remember (Christmas)"" -- 1972.The 3 other tracks are not charted songs --""Subterranean homesick blues""""Mother nature's son""""Sail away""There are some good songs here,but 3 of 10 charted songs are missing.It's dissappointing this ""Best of"" c.d. does NOT include.1. ""Without you"" -- Nilsson's only #1 hit.2. ""As time goes by"" -- 1973.3. ""Daybreak"" -- 1974.""Daybreak"" is from the movie ""Son of Dracula"" staring:Nillson > Ringo Starr, drums > Peter Frampton, guitar > George Harrison, cowbell.This is a good group of songs for what is here,BUT it is a hugh loss that ""Without you"" is not in this ""hits"" lineup.All original recordings."
5,Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys Shredded Wild Salmon,Thank you for making my cat a happy girl! She is very fussy and it was wonderful coming home to find a case of food for her to enjoy. Thank you!
4,Funny!,"This starts with a real life situation that faced my daughter... Michelle is the best player on her soccer team. As a result she is picked for the All-Star team. At her first All-Star practice, she realizes that she is the worst player on the All-Star team! Michelle decides to change that by working on her soccer skills after school... but when will she do her homework?... in the middle of the night while everyone else is asleep! Funny and a good story. However it gets a little awkward because the all the characters from the Full-House series appear in the book even if there is no reason for them to be there. It got a little confusing for my daughter because she does not know the characters from the Full-House series and they kept popping up through out the book."
2,I found this book very incomplete,"There is so much missing from this book,I am doubtful the Author has ever been to Mims,Florida.There are dozens of people who should Have been noted in the story people like Mrs.Kathrine Bouie who was an Educator,and the first registered African American Democrat to vote in Brevard county. She was also related to Moore. The fact that the only place mentioned in the book is Pretties jook joint is criminal in it's self. I am from Mims Florida,and I did not get a good feel from this book. I feel I wasted eighteen dollars. yours truelyJohn King."
1,Another Whitewash for Civil Rights Icon Harry T. Moore,"The author followed the FBI, the police, the Klan and Sherriff Willis McCall as if everything they said and did was ordered from the almighty and couldn't possibly be wrong. He bought the party line and didn't make any waves. He didn't do any in-depth investigating. This was an overview of a life of a man who should be honored by all the world as an icon for justice, for all men. It was a great let down that the author didn't follow the reporting that had been done previously and refrain from writing in such a mean spirited manner. At least maybe some more people will know what this brave man did and stood for. He should be likened to Nathan Hale who said ""I'm sorry I have but one life to give for my country."" The book didn't say it but let all citizens unite and Remember "" Respectfully yours, HARRY T. MOORE."" Could anything be more eloquent or brave thatn that signature?"
5,impressed,"As a kid I used to be into lots of different kinds of metal: black, heavy, doom and whatnot. However, I thought that this phase was way behind me. Then I heard about the Angelic Process and listened to some samples from this album, which weren't like anything I'd known before. So I decided to give it a try and got their first release. I must say I was quite unimpressed, but with time it definitely grew on me and I made up my mind about getting ""Weighing..."". Boy did it blow me away! Absolutely atmospheric and musically intricate with parts of intensity comparable to symphonic crescendo. And the addition of vocals, though in the background, makes it even more interesting. More accessible than their debut and strongly recommended!"
3,Heavier than plutonium,"Boy, can I ever describe this for you. Okay, take Ministry's loudest and most dense work, put a fuzz filter on it that buries everything in mud and then mix it half shoegazer and half ambient drone and you get songs aptly titled like ""World Deafening Eclipse"". Got it? The only way this even comes close to working is played at top volume at 3AM in a club where everyone is dressed in black and chains. But the music is well written, it's not just a bunch of noise, there are (deeply embedded) hooks in there and enough compelling passages in a NIN sort of way so that it's actually listenable. Some people are really going to dig this, but I'll pass. I like dark music, but I never get this gloomy!"
4,Exactly as Appears.,"Good product. It is exactly what one would expect, though not as entertaining for lengths of time. My son enjoys using this violin as a violin, guitar and cello. We are happy with the purchase."
5,Good Toy.,"I purchased this toy violin for my daughter when she turned 4 and she still plays with it at age 7. Unlike most music toys, the Tune in Violin is not as annoying as other musical or noisy toys tend to be. I must admit that was my main concern when I was considering this gift for my daughter. It plays a number of classical songs, in a key that does not grate on the ears of adults, and kids love it cause it's like they are playing the songs. Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to any parent with musically inclined/ curious children."
1,This information is dangerous!,"Many of Dumke's suggestions could be deadly to those with wheat and milk allergies. She suggests using spelt instead of what. Spelt is just an ancient form of wheat! Goat's milk is another alternative she suggests. Goat's milk is a milk protein with the same allergens as cow's milk! I first referred to her book after finding out about my food allergies and was looking for information. I ended up getting severely ill after trying spelt, goat's milk and other ""alternatives."" I was clueless and naive and I don't want anyone else to have to experience what I went through."
5,shark seeker,"For the size of the book, it is a fantastic reference. Although it represents North Carolina fossils, it does well for other areas too. I collect in New Jersey and the specimens I find there are also noted in this guide. I highly recommend it."
5,big between the cracks,"John Prine, Leo Kottke, and Jimmie Dale Gilmore written by Bob Dylan, or vice versa. I would highly recommend this wonderful album, trust me, these are the prettiest butterfly wings you'll ever find. I like Lucinda Williams, and think Gillian Welch is incredible, I love Gram Parsons, and Uncle Tupelo. I like everything on this album and give it frequently as a gift. I have a 300 disc CD changer that I am constantly upgrading, Paul Siebel has remained for about seven years now."
5,Classic Donna Troy Teen Titans Wonder Girl,This is the ultimate Donna Troy as Wonder Girl. This is the Wonder Girl I grew up on and so it was only right that I buy this figure. Everyone at my house admires this figure hanging on the wall next to Wonder Woman.
5,pretty much the best fish oil on the market.,I've done a fair bit of research. And I believe this fish oil to be the best on the market.
4,Beautiful Set,"I was at a restaurant where these sake cups were used and loved the color. They match my kitchen perfectly, are great quality and also very beautiful. However, the reason I have four stars instead of five is because the carafe (the part you heat the sake in) is smaller than average and I consistently have to keep refilling it."
2,Not that special IMO,"I ordered some of this and tried it, but didn't find it to be all that special, rather thin for a pea soup (maybe it's a noveau appeal thing?).I think it to be overpriced for what it is (or was when I tried it).I would have perhaps considered giving it three stars if the cost per can (even on sale) weren't so high."
1,I Defy You To Listen to This Album,"I bought this in a cut out bin for [...]. I got ripped off.It's so bad it made my ears bleed. I still wake up in the middle of the night whispering ""the horror...the horror."" Think of the campy tunes of the Patridge Family. Now imagine them with a techno beat. It's even worse than that. No one will ever dance to these no matter how drunk they are, how late it is at the wedding, how funky that slightly off Uncle looks on the dance floor.But seriously, I think this is the reason the world hates us. [...] like this album. If I ever meet producer-mixer Craig J, I'm going to take a swing at him."
2,David Cassidy is wonderful...this cd is NOT!,"I purchased this cd and listened to it twice. It was hard to hear the songs, I loved growing up, turned into techno trash.This is nothing new. If David wanted to try a new style of music, then he should have written something new. Seeing him perform this live was even more painful. David has always been a leader so why is he following a prerecorded beat. We all make mistakes David. We still love you and can't wait until you stop rehashing the past, with a twist and give us some new David Cassidy tunes. Would love to see him record ""Hush"" and ""Common Theif"". He does them in concert and they are wonderful!!David Cassidy = sexy, soleful and intimate. This new cd is none of those!"
1,One star is being generous,"This has been my least favorite book since I first got my Kindle. Loved Laura Crum, Kit Ehrman, A. K. Alexander, L. C. Evans, Maryann Myers. I was hoping this book would be similiar. I did not like the main character, seemed like a pretty shallow, silly woman. I pretty much figured out the ""bad guys"" in the first chapter they were introduced. Kept hoping the plot would get better, it did not. Won't buy anymore Kathleen Delaney books."
1,ADULT THEMED ITEM DOES NOT BELONG,This should not be a choice when I am looking at clothes for my toddler girl!!!I know this is a mistake...
4,Very technical book that tells the story,Mr. Steven's book tells the story of how this rifle was adopted and he goes into great detail. If you are uninterested in this level of detail perhaps this isn't the book for you. But for the enthusiast this is a four or five star book. It really depends on your level of interest.
2,What was the point of the book?,This book was incredibly difficult to read. Despite my interest in the subject matter it was just a difficult and rather cumbersome read.I think having someone with a flair for storytelling instead of stapling together disjointed reports would be an improvement. Even the typesetting was difficult. At the end of each paragraph you had to decide where to continue reading.It was almost as if you had to know the material to read the book.
1,bad wifi router,Do not recommend it sucks it don't work half of the time. No good product don't buy. It might be cheap but its not good.
3,Uneven,"While this is a very thorough guide in some ways, the author's clear distaste for the modern western makes it less than authoritative. He doesn't even try to understand the spaghetti western or any of Eastwood's directorial efforts. This caveat aside, the material that IS here is worthwhile and interesting. It's a good resource and overview. A little more balance would have made it great. ."
4,"Best book on Classic American ""adult"" Western films","If you are not a big fan of spaghetti westerns, of juvenile ""b"" westerns of the Roy Rogers/Hopalong Cassidy variety and westerns made after the seventies, but instead are a fan of American ""Adult"" Westerns made from the late thirties to the early seventies, then this is the best reference/critical guide book I have come across.I can not begin to count the number of times over the past twenty years I have picked up this book, I may not agree 100% with the authors comment's but I have never found a anyone else writing on film who comes closer to my own views, and I think the same would be true of most fans of the American ""adult"" western.The book may be almost 25 years old, but that is no problem. Because how many films have people likeBen Johnson, Randolph Scott, John Wayne, Glen Ford, Gary Cooper, Jimmy Stewart, Slim Pickens, Lee Van Cleef,Fred MacMurray and Audie Murphy made in the years since?"
2,Nothing after the 50's please.,"I have nothing new to add here. Maybe the single most biased book on film I have ever read. Granted, Garfield isn't alone in his distaste for the more recent versions of his chosen genre (I have seen similar criticism in horror films, although a few with actual merit). His dislike for modern, post 1950 Westerns is evident, and he continually drives home that fact over and over. Since this book was published in the early 80's, he may have never seen restored versions of Italian Westerns, whose butchered prints were so prevalent then. Not that it would matter, as he likely would hate them regardless. There is some good analysis, if you weed through the constant grouching."
5,A favorite of ours,"This is wonderfully written. My 3 yr old son loves saying, ""But Bob is very red."" (a repeated line in the book) In my particular book, the small board book, the blue color looks more purple than blue, but, other than that, this book is fantastic. It gets read a lot in our house."
5,Logical Thinking,"""Primarily Logic"" is a good workbook for teachers to use with students who struggle beyond literal comprehension. It is sequential in difficulty and covers classification, relationships and analogies. It has helped 4th and 5th grade students with reading difficulties."
4,Good but not great....,"A book with a fairly decent selection of various activities, though a few of the questions and answers are not straight forward enough for children (regardless of their IQ) and most adults would disagree with a few of the answers here and there. However, it's a good selection and a place to start for these types of activities. I'd buy it again."
5,"A ""must read"" for all martime historians & shipwreck buffs.","Published in association with the Mariners' Museum in Virginia and use maps, photos and color illustrations throughout to make for histories which are lively and probing, History Of Shipwrecks provides stories of shipwrecks and treasure locations around the world, from archaeology and treasure hunting to the history behind individual wrecks. An intriguing title."
2,The poltical correct hero,"John Brown was in this book which made me go straight to a Half-Priced Books and sell it.John Brown was not a hero, he was a terrorist. He was for a good cause, but he took his views too far when he raided Harper's Ferry(West Virginia). He helped fan the flames for the Civil War."
4,THE BIRTH OF A GIANT,First screenplay by Ingmar Bergman. Main character played by Alf Kjellin who directed a few Columbo episodes in the seventies. A student falls in love with a prostitute who is mentally tortured by a sadistic teacher. Bergman's obsessions are already present in this 1944 movie.
5,Your Cheating yourself if you don't read this book,AN AMAZING STORY THAT HOLLYWOOD SHOULD MAKE INTO A MOVIE!! MRS LAWSON TAKES US THRU THE STORY OF HER LIFE WHICH INTERWINDS WITH BOLTH WORLD WARS. THE DESCRIPTIONS OF DAY TO DAY LIFE MADE ME REALIZE JUST HOW LUCKY I AM AND HOW MUCH WE TAKE FOR GRANTED HEAR IN THE USA. DOROTHEA'S LIFE IS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF LIFE IS NOT WHAT HAPPENDS TO YOU BUT HOW YOU REACT TO WHAT HAPPENDS TO YOU. I ENJOYED READING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A GERMAN CITIZEN LIVING IN BERLIN. MY DAUGHTER IS READING IT NOW AND SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE CAN'T PUT IT DOWN. THE BOOK IS A MUST READ!!!!!
5,A Must Read for Every American!,"This is an incredible story, so personal, yet so full of historical detail. Every American should read this book...to understand world history, the German people, and their amazing will to survive unthinkable hardship. I couldn't put it down.Dorothea Lawson has given us a wonderful gift that brings insight, reflection, appreciation for our own freedom. Don't miss it! This is the way we should learn history, from real people with real courage."
2,Foul Circle: An Insult to Gene Clark,"What a disappointment. And what a banal track ""The Byrd who couldn't fly""! Words fail me. Play this once - you' ll never play it again - and then listen to the originals. They are rarely off MY 'turntable' anyway. With the issue of 'The Gene Clark demos' all we need now is for ""Two sides ..."" and ""LA Sessions"" (a superior reworking of ""... With the Gosdin Brothers"") to be out on CD. Until then, don't buy this record, there are few tracks that do justice to Gene Clark's particular genius."
1,"Looks great, when it isnt broken","I bought 2 of these monitors, owned them for less than four months, and they both failed. Just don't turn on anymore. Called Viewsonic for warranty service. They say no problem, just pack them up, ship them to us at your cost, we will keep them for a minimum of 2 weeks and then ship them back. If they can be fixed. Otherwise you get a refurbished one.What kind of company will keep someone without a monitor for a month?So I am shipping these back, buying a new LCD from another company, and then selling this trash to someone else."
5,Illustratively Beautiful!,"Originally purchased this book for my children when they were young from a book club. Found it on Amazon, at a good price point, and purchased it to actually frame the illustrations and art. The stories are sweet and good for young children; but the pictures are really beautiful. So whenever my children have children, I will enjoy reading this book to them, while they can become familiar with the art first! Purchase two, one for reading and the other for framing the art!"
1,boring movie,It is an exetremely BORING movie. Some of the people on it are so old you can't hear them. Some people talk japaneese and you can't understand them. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen!
4,Fun cheap camera,This is a very low cost digital camera. So don't expect the optical performance of a fancy Canon or Nikon. But for the price it's really amazing what you can get. It takes real digital pictures and allows you to preview them on a real color display. How cool! The GUI is quite good but the 5-way button is probably the weak spot for overall ruggedness. This camera is not designed for hard knocks. Enjoy.
4,Kidsongs.,"I can't help it. I am 11 and I still watch this crap. Littarly, I am still watching this crap."
5,The Best Thrills cd yet!,"I have all 3 Thrills cds and Teenager is the best one of the bunch. The songs on Teenager are more infectious and catchy. Not just bubble gum catchy, but thoughtful arrangements. Songs 4,6,7, and 11 are my favorites. There's just a few filler songs."
2,it's not as brilliant as i expected it to be,"some shorts were nice,but i expected somehow more,according to the ratings of other reviewers,so if you choose this dvd,it's not a must,it's ok,but not more."
2,No where near as good as the theatre,"I would like to voice my disipointment. There were quite a few clips I would have definately rather seen then what was displayed. The DVD is still pretty cool - but it is essentially missing some stronger pieces I've seen. ""Rejected"" was not even placed on the DVD. There is though a lot of other features to the DVD that are interesting though, but, Spike and Ike's previous Animation DVD's unfortunately top this.Good show though - support it. Definately worth catching it next year when the new tour starts."
4,good address book,"I'd get it again if need be. Good small size, but it would've been nice if there was a place for birthdays right within the address section. Otherwise very cute and clever!"
5,Address Book,This address book was exactly what I was looking for! It is user friendly and fashionable :)
1,Worst address book,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. The most irritating part was the word ""enemies"" on the back cover. This is not known when purchasing the book. I know it is on the back cover, but why would that word be put on an address book of friends? Just couldn't use it... I would see that word every day. The alphabet letter divider pages contained quotes, some just ridiculous. I didn't even look at all of them. I didn't like the layout of the pages either.Book was returned to Amazon, who took it back without question."
3,Beware it's extremely small!,"If you do read the packaging label, it does indeed say 1.5"" but the picture is elusive and appears to market it as being like it's big brother in size ... I was fooled by it's extreme overpricing that it was the larger 2"" version... if you need it this small then feel free, otherwise opt for a cheaper website sale of the 2"" version..."
4,Clan Wolf Sourcebook Review,"A great book, one that I will use in the everyday BattleTech game. This sourcebook covers the camo designs and all the different stars, binaries, trinaries, and all standard galaxies for ultra-realistic play. Great for creating models. Topped off with detailed 'Mech designs to provide even more diversity for the Wolf Clan player. A great book, I recommend it to everyone."
4,mostly great,"This book is a great werewolf reference although some of the information is a little off. for instance there are a great many metal tools that have been found in north america. the oldest copper axe here dates to 6600 years old and is of exemplary quality suggestiong that metalurgy began in north america at least 7000 years ago! The Etowah mounds in Georgia and the Cahokia mounds in ohio have both yielded furnaces used to smelt metal, mostly copper but possibly iron ore as well, more research is required. This is a great book but i suggest you go out and do some additional research on your own. I reccomend 'the southeastern indians' by charles hudson. Knights of Spain; Warriors of the Sun by the same author is another great book that details the expedition of Hernando De Soto and would make a great story for a game- with some poiniant pollitical and historical undertones- enjoy!"
1,Didn't germinate!,We didn't get a single seed to germinate. Waste of money and time. We followed the instructions but we didn't get any action. I would not recommend buying this.
1,No More Hal,This is another book for the trash heap. These hal leonard books only give you very short parts of the songs. Most of them arn't even the good parts. From now on i will look inside books at the store before i buy them anywhere. And no more hal leonard scams.
2,not top quality,The pants fit great but ripped during the first wear... we even sized them one up for proper fit. it would be nice if more quality in craftsmanship would have been applied
4,Nice CD with lots of gems ...,This has among other great tracks Leo Hall's My Neighborhood which was recorded at Lee Perry's studio and seems impossible to find elsewhere (except on original 45 but I've never seen one - I was told it was on Arab ...) Could be all kinds of other rarities on this solid compilation.
2,Nice simple player...but,"It is a nice sounding MP3 player. Even my 4 year old grand daughter can operate it, which is why I bought it for my wife. She gets lost in all the menu choices of other players.However, problems....1. Random function may work on the 1G models, but on the 2G model herethe random OFTEN plays songs over again. (Maybe a larger seed valueCoby)2. The main ON-OFF-PLAY button sticks and requires many attempts to getthe unit on or off.3. I find it hard to believe the 2.5mm headphones were required. Thestandard 3.5mm looks like it would fit the tiny case. The 2.5-3.5adapter is in the package, just something else to get lost.Over all, nice product. I would buy another, which I did for my grand-daughter. 1G model- Hot (Princess) Pink."
5,Good Product,"Works great and sounds great. Very simple to use, got one for my 9 year old also. Holds a lot of music, and ultra simple to add or delete songs to. Clips right to the collar of my shirt so does not get lost or have long cord dangling getting caught on things, and runs for a long time on a charge(rechargable, another good feature) No does not have pictures or movies or playlists or books like my son's Ipod, and needs headphones with the really small 2.5mm jack, but if you just want an inexpensive mp3 player that sounds great and is easy to use, especially when mowing the lawn or exercising, and with the clip no pockets necessary, then this is for you. A good way to figure out if you would really use an Ipod enough to justify getting one too."
4,The Gulf War Behind Enemy Lines,"Mike Kelly's account of the Gulf War in Martyr's Day: Chronicle of a Small War, is informative and interesting. The Gulf War was carefully planned, undertaken and won by the United States in little over a month. Kelly has carefully written about the war from behind the lines and places we weren't able to see on CNN. I am quite amazed at one point, that Mike Kelly actually swam across a river into Turkey with smugglers. Courage and bravery Mike Kelly must be commended with. His book should be given the same credit for what he went through to write it."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT FOR INCREASING ENERGY LEVEL,I first heard about this product about 10 years ago and decided to try it. It really helped me when my energy level was low. It has a kind of brown sugar flavor to me that I like. I ran out of it and didn't use it for years but lately I have been feeling really tired all of the time again and so I ordered two bottles again. I am so happy because it still works great. I highly recommend this product to increase your energy level.(c) Laura Beth Hattersley
5,A big hit!,"Gave it to my 1 year old grandson for Christmas. He didn't know what to make of it at first, but his daddy got in and then there was no stopping him. Had a great time with it. Little kids just love private spaces of there own. Very well made and easy to assemble and disassemble, and he loves the jungle animals on it. Highly recommend it. The tunnel is a really added bonus."
4,great tent hours of fun,"I bought this for my 18 month old for Christmas...he is very durable, made with great material...the only down fall I have found it that the tunnel does not attach...u just stick it in the whole of tent and hope it doesn't come out..i find myself straightening t all the time and pushing it back in or out a little bc it gets pushed in more...although this is a downfall this is the most durable tent we have even purchased I put some ball pit balls in it zipped it up and he played for hours"
4,Backyard Safari,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 18 months and one year later she still loves this product. The tent and the tunnel detach, so since we've moved into a smaller place the tunnel stays inside, while the tent portion is used for picnicing and naps in the backyard. It's held up very well with two adults, one toddler, and a 60lb. dog crawling through it. It doesn't have a single rip anywhere. I would definitely recommend this product."
4,play tent and tunnel,"We bought this for a Christmas gift for our 2 yr. old grandson. Unfortunately, their house is very small and the parents thought the tent was too large so they returned it. We found out that when one returns a gift to Amazon, one gets a credit. So now the parents have a credit to get something else."
4,It takes a beating,"I bought this tent because it sounded more heavy duty that the others that were available. When it came, I was dismayed because it was in a small box like the less expensive varieties, and not heavy like I expectd. My grandsom is 16 months and very active. He loves the tunnel and tent and gets pretty rambuncious with it. He stands outside and jumps on the sides when not rolling around the ground inside the tunnel. It seems to go with him and spring right back. No tearing, no poles breaking. I was surprised. I especially love to recieve pictures of my grandson still playing in his tent every day. And it's plenty big enough for grandma to get in and play!!The only drawback, is that the wind picks it up and blows it all over the yard very easily."
5,Covers ages,"We bought this for our 6 yr old grandson's birthday, but our 18 month old loves it also. They have so much fun on the rainy afternoons and he loves ""camping out"" for a nap. It was a life saver when he had the flu. I can't wait until it can be taken outside also."
5,Hours of FUN!!!,My 20 month old received this toy for Christmas. He LOVES it.. you can even separate the tunnel from the tent and play with either by itself. Great buy for a busy Toddler!!
2,Better choices available,"I was a bit disappointed when I compared this to Musher's Secret wax. The consistency of this was a bit ""watery"", and when the dogs came back in the house, they left a trail on my carpet (again, unlike Musher's Secret)."
1,Breaks,fast shipping but it broke on my kids in less than a day (just by grabbing stuff). It does not work as well as the normal claw grabber.
4,Versatile,"My two year old grandson and his daddy LOVE this toy. They grab people, objects and each other. It's a favorite toy for both of them."
4,Lloyd...the Babbitt of the '90's.,"Mick Jagger once said that the hardest part of writing a rock & roll song was ending it. That's why many just fade out. Pity Bing couldn't just have faded out this otherwise delightful tale of corporate America - a sort of ""Babbitt"" of the late 20th century. The ending is horribly contrived and mars the work. Stop at the last chapter but one, and this book deserves the full five stars."
5,Great business novel for the Gen'xer or Boomer,"I just graduated from college and wanted some summer reading before I begin work on Wall Street. I was looking for a novel that was business centered, creative, witty, funny, and suspensful and this book delivered all of these qualities. I highly recommend this book to anyone, I found myself unable to put ""Lloyd"" down for a moment. I can't wait to read the next book that ""Stanley Bing"" writes."
2,Pointless,"The author spends to much time on telling us about Lloyds family, shopping trips and his affair. Some of this book is funny but most of it is boring and it lacks any kind of noteworthy plot or story."
4,"""Martin Taragano's Basketball Book Review""","Total Basketball is a towering accomplishment and a wonderful addition to the basketball literature. It is currently the most authoratative single volume of 100+ years of basketball history on the bookshelves. It's readable and important and a significant contribution to past & present NBA glory; however, in numerous respects it's coverage is indeed parsimonious; for example, there's but a mere scattering of biographical information on the 3500+ professional players; myriad biographical entries explored in more vivid and analytical narrative depth would have more positively supplemented the standard statistical exhaustion of encyclopedic single-volume sports tomes of this nature. Nonetheless, TB is a winner."
5,I love this thing,If you have a double pedal this is a must have. I can't believe I waited as long as I did to get one. Real cheap price too
2,Fine if you like the color of baby aspirin,"Lots of blankets are soft, but if you're buying an difficult to find color like this, you probably want exactly the color pictured. I know I did. It's not at all the vibrant orange shown... more like the color of an orange flavored Sweet Tart or maybe a vitamin C chewable... They should take a new picture."
5,worth every penny,"This blanket was not only reasonably priced, but is so soft and washes well. My grandson cuddled up in it and loves it, the color is different than the usual baby colors and I really am happy about my purchase. If you like orange and soft and practical, get this blanket, it is worth every penny!"
3,"Soft, but color not very accurate","Be aware that the actual color of this blanket is like washed-out tangerine. On my screen it looks like a much bolder, richer orange."
1,Disappointed,"I paid for all four episodes of this series and when I went to watch the fourth installment, it was the exact same episode as the 1st Trimester. Boo."
2,If you ONLY want an Epidural,"Although I like ""Wendy"" and a lot of the information presented for the prenatal and postpartum sections of the video I found L&D; the information lacking. It lacked a since of empowerment of the mother and father. This is after all their birth! It didn't show any ideas for comfort measures. It didn't give the risk of the hospital procedures or options to avoid them.It gives ALL the responsibility and credit to the doctors. I found that sad. A real education goes much deeper than teaching you how to be a good patient."
3,A Childbirth Educator's View,"This DVD or VHS presentation is cute and has some good basic information. There are some definite biases presented that could flavor the way expectant parents see childbirth. Twice, information is given and it is not accurate to 2002. These two pieces of information include the mechanism of episiotomy and the rate of cesarean section. The DVD informs parents that the lack of an episiotomy may cause tears, when research shows evidence to the opposite. And the cesarean section is presented at 20% when in reality, it is more like 25%. Unfortunately there is no reference to the power that women have to raise their pain tolerance through comfort measures, all women are shown to labor in bed and no mother pushes in an upright position. Not a surprise that all 3 women shown op for an epidural, two have oxygen and one has a cesarean."
1,Literally for dummies,"Don't waste your money on this series. If you are really interested, get it from your library instead. You won't want to watch it more than once, if that. It tries to be cute but ends up being tedious and dumbed down. Most of the info contained in the videos is obvious and they take waaay too long to say it. You could learn much more from a couple of good texts."
4,Useful info.,"I found the video very useful and interesting, but it didn't cover every question that you might have about pregnancy and delivery. It covers all the basic information that you get in paper handouts and doctor instructions, but the video format makes it easier to see and understand."
3,Camelot? I think not.,"Three stars for creativity. This is the first (and last) book I've read by this author. She's good at what she does, a bit overly prosy for me as I was not interested in the subject matter it took me days rather than hours to gnaw my way through the book. There are several sci-fi, feral elves, just plain fantasy as well as a modern day tear jerker (with the only passing reference to Camelot in the book). I was looking forward to a new take on the Arthurian legends and this collection couldn't be further from that; I'd call that false advertising but that's just me. There are strong female characters, men acting badly and some heroic if sorely put upon minors. One or two of the stories even had something as close as she apparently can bring herself to a happy ending. Obviously not my cup of tea especially considering my expectations but again well written and formulated."
3,Fairly good short-story collection,"This book is a compilation of fantasy and science fiction short stories, although all of the stories are not stand-alone stories. There are two of the stories which contain 3 short stories each. Overall, this collection of stories is good, but a couple of the stories are just a titch dark, so I only gave this book 3 stars, because I'm one of those readers who always likes to have a ""happy"" ending."
4,Nice story collection,"These are nicely written stories. They're the first Wurts I've read and now I'm inclined to read more. I actually wish a couple of the stories would have continued and evolved into books because I was drawn to the characters.The only complaint I really have is that the blurb for the hardback made it seem like the stories were all fantasy, when in fact half were SF. The SF was done well (it was space opera/adventure with an edge) but I wasn't in the mood for it, so it would have been nice to know that in advance."
3,Charming,"This book had many great ideas for stories in it. I recomend that if you have nothing to do, read it! Yet, I feel that wurts detail too much in her work. Other than that, it was excellent."
5,very nice picture!!!,"Friendship is important, family is important too but the most important is what you live with them !!!Life is hard but when you have friends like the one on the pictures is easier and fun!!!!"
4,Outstanding blend of fact and fiction...,"This is a truly unique book. In 1987, a cache of letters, albums and clippings was discovered in the attic of a house in Kingston, Ontario, the bits and pieces of an unknown woman's life. Among the overflowing boxes and stuffed sugar sacks was a collection of letters from the months immediately after the First World War, a one-way correspondence written in pencil on flimsy paper. From this careless jumble of papers, there emerged unforgettable characters and an extraordinary story: a convict, a village girl, a penitentiary, and the town that lived in its shadow. The Convict Lover is a dazzling blend of historical detective work and imaginative recreation. You'll be spellbound by the relationship that unfolds through the very secretive, unconventional contacts made between one Joseph Cleroux and his link to the outside world, Phyllis Halliday. This book is an extraordinary stroke of literary good fortune. A wonderful read."

3,downsouth rap,"pretty decent album,good lyrics,good beats,and good features.i have one UNOPENED i will sell for good price as well as other rare rap cds.email for list."
1,Much ado about nothing,"The only parts I enjoyed were views of Shanghai, The Bund, Pudong as it reminded me of my trip there. If the idea of the film was to convey that there's an element of lawlessness and aimlessness in Shanghai, then yes, that was achieved. You can always sense some danger in Shanghai. But I mean, you can't even feel sorry for these people!! I judge a film by how much it keeps me awake...unfortunately, both my husband and I nodded off a few times during the film. Sad, as most indi films have been well worth my time...and don't mistake my ""name"" to think I don't watch serious films - I've seen my fair share."
2,A disappointment,"This video does not match the quality of the videos made by deep purple in the 70s like Machine Head, California Jamming and so on. It's about Purple in the 80s which I and many others believe is very rainbowish. Forget about this video. It's a disappointment"
5,STEVE ALLEN'S BIG BAND JAZZ COMPOSITIONS ARE AWESOME,"This CD has no unexciting tracks. Allen's compositions are up there with the best, and as arranged by Kubis and performed by his big band, the whole shebang comes out to be one of my very favorite jazz albums in my significant size collection.I keep thinking, ""What a shame Steve Allen made his name as a comic, when his musical abilities far outshine his comedy, as good as that is!"""
3,How long?,I am also commenting to see if someone will reply and let me know how long it lasts with the batteries? Thank you
3,Weber Light,This light is more cosmetic than anything else. It did not light up my patio table much.
4,A good introduction to the Struggle of the poor in El Salvad,This was my introduction to El Salvador and I am glad I choose this book. The writing was unique and kept me interested throughout. I am even more interested now about the struggles of the poor in El Salvador during the civil war and even today.
2,BEATIFUL CHAIR - UNTIL IT BREAKS...,"We absolutely love this chair. We bought it in 2002 when our 1st born came. We've been using it through 3 kids. It was great until the chair didn't swivel one day. When we took it apart we found out it was because the rubber liner in the ball-bearing mechanism is cheaply made and comes out. The ball-bearing mechanism is what makes it swivel - without it, you have a wobbly glider. Our problem now is trying to get in touch with Jardine so we can replace the ball-bearing mechanism. Easier said than done. We've been searching for 5 months and we're SOL on this one. Bummer because the chair is comfortalbe, beautiful and is something you want to keep for years and years."
5,the cutest chair!,I love this chair! We originally ordered a different one and fell in love with this one when we were at the store! The chair looks so cute in the nursery and came in within ten days!
5,Timeless and Up-to-Date,"A re-write of his great-Grandfather's timeless classic, ""In His Steps"" first published In 1896, this story stands solidly beside one of the simplest, yet most life-changing works of fiction ever written.I dragged my heels for months before reading this, because I had the very intense feeling that nobody should tamper with the original. Yet this has brought the original home to new generations of readers, losing almost nothing in the transition -- a task I would have thought impossible.The question posed in the original book has launched several generations of reechoing ""What Would Jesus Do?"" In this re-write by great-grandson, Garrett Sheldon, the story remains true to the original and just as life-changing.The very simplicity of the story has blinded some to the depth of the message, but after more than 107 years and 50,000,000 copies of the original and now with updated examples and characters it continues to rank among the best books ever written."
5,Memories,"Whenever someone brings up this book in a discussion... it brings back SO many memories. my mom gave me this book as a kid... I read it over and over. I loved it. I can remember hiding from tornados in our basement with a copy of this book, doing over the neighbors houses when my older sister got hurt, and all the times in between. I proudly wrote my name on the inside cover to mark it as mine. I know some people wonder how Andy in Toy Story felt... But this book was my Woody doll. I would recommened this book to anyone who wants to teach their kids the value of learning from their mistakes."
5,Best Children's Short Devotional Series!,"I used this with my children before ""WWJD"" was popular. It is a series of short stories always ending with ""What would Jesus Do?"" in the situation! So helpful in raising my children and encouraging them to stop and think ""What would Jesus Do?"""
4,Bre's,"This is a very challenging book, one that will make you re-evaluate the way we see and treat God in our daily life as Christians. I, for one, have started asking myself What Would Jesus Do? Unfortunately, looking aesethically, the writing style isn't all that great. Sure, it's got a wonderful, relevent message, but a few literary niceties wouldn't. Still, this is a book all Christians should read."
1,Not the historic presentation of ethics,"The current ""WWJD"" (What Would Jesus Do"") phenomenon is not the Biblical understanding of how we are to determine right and wrong. While this book did not start that pop phenomenon, some may read this mistakenly. What Jesus would do would be different that you or I because He was fully man AND fully God, second Person of the Trinity. He was sinless, and although tempted in every way as we are, He did not sin. His purpose was to fulfill the Law in order to be the spotless sacrificial lamb of God, the atonement and substitute for our sins. He was the omniscient God incarnate, so He knew what was in each heart and what was the perfectly appropriate thing to say and do in each situation in order to accomplish His mission. In that sense, what He would do in a situation as God is a hypothetical we cannot know as finite creatures. What He might have done is a speculation. We are, however, TOLD in Scripture what we are to do, how as Christians we are to act and live."
2,This book is just like a...,"The way this book is written the author throws you a scrap of information and does not reinforce this scrap whatsoever and thus leaves you confused, stressed, and upset !This may sound harsh, but please do not purchase this book unless required to do so by your university (like me). I am an MIS major, and must admit my serious weakness is in programming. This book has done nothing to help me ! If you are a programming person, pickup this book and you'll enjoy. If you are more of a systems administrator type and you know programming knowledge is necessary, but are not the programming type then run far, far away from this book !"
5,BEST BOOK FOR BEGINNING BUISNESS APPLICATIONS+ PROJECTS,"this book is very good for new to vb.net people specilly for buisness like applications and i think this is the best book if u wanna self study the vb.net it has everything except the graphics(they're coverd a little bit),do u know why i think this book is very good because it has flowcharts, it has programming excersizes and on top of that lots of examples. But the major reason i bought this book because this book has projects assignments which i dont find in many books, i carefully searched for many days for the good book and then decided to buy this one.if ur college has three semesters for visual basic programming this book will cover atleasat two and half semester or ""two semesters"" for sure. i'll recommend this book to anyone who is a beginner programmer or a little better than beginner. THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR PRO PROGRAMMERS."
4,Glows in the dark!!,purchased for my wife - she loves it. didn't know when you push the stem the face of watch glows with a light. this was a pleasant surprise - I bought because of its look and got this extra surprise. Only drawback is you have to take to jeweler (or WalMart) to get wristband adjusted.
4,Mixed Feelings,"I bought this watch for all the features that other reviewers liked. It's dial is large enough to be easily read but still dressy; the light is wonderful for night time viewing and the bracelet goes with any jewelry. As reviewers stated the bracelet is very long and most women will have to have it resized.Unfortunately, my watch does have a problem. It stopped everyday for the first two weeks, but if I reset it it would continue to run until the next day. By this time I had the bracelet resized and couldn't return it to Amazon. It now has run for 3 days without stopping but is losing a minute or two each day. I will probably send it back to Timex for repair. I would hope this is an uncommon problem based on the 21 other reviews I read before I ordered it. I do love the watch- it was a good choice, despite the problems. One recommendation is to hold off resizing the band and watch it for a few days before wearing it so you can return it to Amazon in an unworn state, if necessary"
3,"Good price, difficult to modify","I received the ladies' watch in a timely manner (no pun intended) and in the promised condition. It is supposed to be adjustable by removing links from the watch band - however, I have been unable to do this myself, as I don't possess tools small enough to manipulate the miniscule screws. I've tried to take it to a couple of places to have it adjusted for me, but I'm having trouble finding a place that will do it for free."
5,Very chic...,"I bought this watch for Mother's day and requested International shipping. Though the shipping cost me more than the watch itself(it was International shipping so I knew it would be expensive)I am very glad with my purchase. The product was shipped very fast and in perfect condition. Best of all, my Mom absolutely loved it. She is a doctor and I wanted to get her something that's fashionable and at the same time, sophisticated. This two-toned water resistant watch fit the bill perfectly and the indiglo feature is a bonus. Thanks Amazon!"
3,Wish I could rely on Timex,"I've had several Timex watches similar to this one in the past few years. I didn't buy my last one online because I don't like the two-tone, so I bought from a department store one just like this but all silver. After 6 months I have to send it in for repair. It's still under warranty, but I don't like the hassle. My previous Timex only lasted a year and a half. I love the look and feel of the Timex, and the Indiglo, but I'm losing faith in the quality. Maybe I'm just rough on watches, I wear them all the time except swimming or in the shower."
1,Bad!! Never expected from Timex,Presented to my wife and she was happy to see bracelet watch. fits perfectly and no hassle in using this. Good for gifts to dear ones.11/20/12 - Watch is dead stopped working. Strap lost its sheen. Purchased based on product review (battery will last for 10 years) and Brand (Timex). But i am feeling bad for buying this. Gifted item gone wrong reflects bad on me. I never expected this... Beware before buying this watch.
4,"Pleased, However...","I am quite pleased with the Timex watch that I purchased, however, I could not deal with that band!! I replaced it with a stretch silver and gold-toned one and am much happier.Good value for the price."
4,Nice but had to have links removed to fit,"Way too big for a ladies arm. had to bring to a jewellers and pay to get links removed.other than that, she loves it !"
3,Not a ladies watch!,This Timex Women's Fashion Two-Tone Bracelet is not a ladies watch. I bought it to replace an identical one that quit working. The band has 4 extra links than the original and is huge. It falls off my wrist. Loved the first one; not so much this one.
3,Two-Tone Girl,I bought this watch b/c I like the two-tone look (silver & gold). I wear silver earrings and a gold necklace - the watch ties it together. Not impressed w/ the Indiglo feature - simply put - it doesn't work but it keeps time so that's that!
2,Problem links,This is a really pretty watch but i needed to remove two links even though I have large hands. It is literally impossible to remove these myself! I wish I had read all reviews for purchase but I trusted the Timex name. Now I will have to pay a jeweler to remove the links which seems silly to do for a watch in this price range!
2,Heavy watch for wrist,"I'm very disappointed that the watch is so heavy. Also the band is very large on my wrist and it is not easy to take out the links to adjust it smaller. I will need to pay someone to do this, since my husband said it needed special tools. I thought I could just slide it up my wrist but it unlatches instead. I like the easy to read face, date and the Indiglo Night Light features. I do hope it does not cost to much to fix the band and that I can get used to the heavier watch. I'm a Timex owner for over 40 years but next time I will just shop at a store and try it on!"
1,Randy's Review,The watch was a birthday present for my mother. The watch perfectly fine but the battery lasted about 10 days. Now I need to have the battery replaced already.
1,NO GOOD,"I thought the watch would fit anyone. It does not fit me, much too large. There are directions with it on removing links to make it fit and the directions say they have perpossly made it difficult. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE!!! Maybe if I took it to a Jewelry Store they could fix it but it would maybe cost more than the watch is worth. I thought the watch was an expansion band. It looked like one in the picture. This has sure turned me off from Amazon and gift cards."
2,the band is awfully long,This thing hung as loose on my wrist as if it were sized for a gorilla. It felt heavy and clunky. If you have a slender wrist I do not recommend it.
3,Bracelet is very large,"The watch itself is okay, but the bracelet part is very large...I was going to have to take out at least two links and my wrists are not unusually small...to have a jeweler do it would have cost another $8...Sent it back...Amazon though is the best company! Shipping is always fast and on time!! Order from them all the time."
4,Nice watch at a good price,"This is a nice watch at a good price. It has nice details such as being able to set the date separate from the time and the indiglo background. Like all watches for me, way too big of a wrist band. It might fit a man or a lreally large female. I had to take out at least 4-5 links. Not hard to do with $3 tool I bought to do so. My last timex daily watch lasted nearly 20 years!"
4,Great except for the band!,"I'm happy with the watch now that it fits! I couldn't believe how large the band was; I had to have 5 links taken out! I do have small wrists and I have to say I was warned from reading reviews before I bought it, but it can't be necessary to make a women's watch band that big! I also like the lighted dial and the two-tone feature."
4,good looking,"the look is great but a little bit small, is a great present for any occasion and everyday use"
2,Lasted 2 years & 4 months,"I loved the light on this watch to check the time in the night. It quit working about a month ago. I replaced the battery about a month ago, and the light worked for another week, then stopped again. The watch looks nice, but now it is out of warranty, and I could continue wearing it, but it is useless to me at night."
2,links,"Its a pretty watch, but I cannot remove the extra links. Instructions are difficult to understand, other than it is meant to be difficult to do. I hesitate to go to a watch repair place and spend as much money as the watch cost."
4,Nicer than it's picture!,"I really like my new Timex. It is very classy looking and the face is very easy to read. I like the date feature and the lighted face in the dark. The only drawback was, I had to take it to my jeweler to have some links removed, but the charge was minimal. All in all, good value for the price."
4,Husband loves!!,"Husband saw Moe Bandy in a concert, so I ordered him the CD Live at Billy Bobs. He loves it and plays it in his car all the time."
2,disappointed!,"I bought this doll for my 7 yr old daughter for Christmas and I wish that I could take it back. The doll looks great in the box but is a totally different story when taken out. My daughter wanted to play with it as soon as she unwrapped it, this doll is not a doll that can be played with without parent help. I found the doll hard to feed both by the botle(that leaks) and by the packaged food that has to be mixed just right and is extremly hard to feed to the doll .I never got the doll to use the potty or cry tears. I baby sound that the box states is mearly a squeaky in the dolls arm(something similar to what is used in a laytex dog toy). This doll is priced at $39.99, which in my opinion is over priced for what you get. I am very disappointed in this doll, but then again I'm not 7."
5,My fourth baby doll!,"I had 3 dolls: Baby Benjamin, Baby Annabell and Tiny Tears and when I got this I was happy!Accessories:Bottle capBottle teatbottlenappyonesiefive feeding packetsbirth paperspottyduck toydollbraceletfeeding bowlfeeding spoonSo thats alot, isn't it! I like her equal with Annabell. I think you should buy it! I got it saving 19.00!Bye!"
1,returned,i was so excited when i got this toy when i got home i opened it andit wasn't what i thought it would talk all it did was squek i had to return it the next day and got love me chou chou instead also i tried giving it water it came out everywere well maybe sometime they will have a great doll for every body
5,GREAT TOY!!!,I love this baby born so much it is soc cool and I love all the functions. I must admit that the crying doesn't really work but I love every other function.
3,Stupid Doll,"This doll is a disgrace to every doll in the universe. So what? It poops, and pees and cries. Get any real baby and it'll do the same for free! This is the ugliest, wierdest doll i have ever seen. It looks too realistic, and i think people might get nightmares from looking at this doll."
5,Darling!,"I actualy have a log on and that stuff, but I don't find the need to use it.-----------------------------------------------------------------I bought it for a potty training tool for my daughter and she loves it! I also love her too! When little Kalie (my Daughter) is taking a nap, I play with baby born, who we named, Sally.I think of Sally of another daughter. Kalie even thinks she is her sister! Once, she asked, ""Mommie, were you pregnant again?"" Kalie likes that she ""poopies"". Kalie is now on the potty and she brought Sally so she can go with her. Kalie is wanting to bring to Baby Born to her first day of Grade K. CUTE!"
2,not what we expected,"we purchased this doll last year for our almost two year old. we were expecting our second and thought this doll would help ease the transition. not the case! we were atracted to this particular doll because of all the fancy functions it could perform minus the batteries other dolls required. sounded like a great idea,however, every time you feed, bathe, or use her in the pool, she needs to be cleaned. that can sometimes take twenty minutes. i am never able to empty her of all the water she retains inside. she is a high maintenance doll. we have since stopped feeding her or bathing her because we don't want to deal with it at the end of the day. her hard body also makes it hard for my now three year old to hug and cuddle. she has a hard time moving the arms and legs on her own. i think the idea of the doll is great, just not practical for younger children."
1,Buy a different doll.,"My daughter asked me for a year for this doll. I finally broke down a bought it for her for Christmas last year. My daughter loved her, BUT to get her on the potty we had to shove her into it, we never did get her to cry, and feeding her was impossible.My daughter still carries her around and dresses her, but she's just like any doll she already had (that costs a lot less). We don't feed her or put her on the potty anymore, it's too much trouble. Also she is HARD plastic. Moving her arms and legs into different positions takes some muscle, and she's kind of ugly too. On the plus side, my son colored her with black permanent marker, when my daughter was at school, and it came off with some comet and she never knew it."
3,To hard to feed.,"We bought this for our 4 yr old daughter last year.>She loves that it can go in the water, pee, and that she can change its diaper and clothes.The problems:>The water comes out of the bottle if you apply pressure, without pressure the water doesn't go in, thus the baby doesn't pee.>Feeding her is almost impossible. She has yet to get the food into her. Thus nothing comes out in her potty.I can't get her to eat enough to go potty either."
2,not fun,"My four year old does not find this toy much fun. First of all, it is nothing like what I expected. It is not like the old ""Baby Alive"" doll. She does not wet well, and ALWAYS leaks, from both ends. Also, she is not a pretty doll, no hair is weird."
3,wouldn't bother,"This doll is way too stiff and cumbersome. That being said, my daughter loved it -- simply because it was a doll. It came with a bottle that had way too pointy a nipple (I didn't let my 18month old even see it) - you could definitely poke an eye out w/that thing! The doll doesn't fit on the potty seat that comes with it. I think they tried to do too much with this doll -- too many holes and other dumb gadgets that really aren't needed. I can't believe I spent as much money on it as I did... My daughter loves her $5 doll from Walmart much more than this piece of junk!"
4,a new sister for my daughter,we recently had a new baby and my older daughter who was 5 wanted to help take care of her. So I got her this doll so she could practice. She loves the doll. Now when I feed the baby she feeds hers and changes it.
4,BABY BORN IS FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Oh, i lov this toy!When you lay her down she pees on me and that's funny!i got a changing table a combort seat a bed for her and i nam her Casey Jr.Casey Jr. is now want's to play with me so I put the Baby born sports day Clothes and Casey Jr. loves ! and alsoi change her diaper and Casey Jr. was crying when i sqeak her hand so she can pee on her potty so then when i'ts bedtime....She was sleeping!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Oh, I lov baby born and her assercious!Hmmm............................next tim i'll get a baby born food next time!"
2,My Aching Neck,"Once I assembled this chair, I thought I finally got myself a good computer chair, where I can watch Netflix and anything else I want. Well, on day two I found myself getting a strange headaches, and neck aches. I tried to understand why, and then I figured it out: no neck pillow or cushion. My previous computer deck chair does have that portion onto it, and it was great. --- Really, when I first looked at this recliner chair, I immediately thought I got to get me one, and when I did get it I thought it's gonna be the one, but the end result is No, not yet. --- I've just ordered myself a neck pillow and hopefully the two will work just right. --- Second Item, I would be nice if the chair had some smooth stone like base footings to smoothly slide it across my carpet. --- So, in conclusion I give this chair 2.5 stars, but after I added some smooth footing + that neck pillow, I might give this chair 4 stars, if all works out right."
3,Nice Chair,"Overall, the chair is nice...not the greatest recliner in the world but for the price, its a good buy. Its not easy to assemble. There are not a lot of pieces to assemble...but except for the base, not everything lines up easily. As an example you have to connect the armrests to the chair with three bolts on each side. The holes on the chair and the armrest do not easily line up. Also, the base chair is heavy so it's not easy to maneauver while your trying to line things up. I did this alone, maybe with help it would be easier."
4,good buy,purchased this for hubby for his gaming room and it was a hit. he loves it. the chair is comfy and perfect for him. he put it together by himself but told me it was not too easy. only reason why it was not a five star review....other then that its great and the price was even better. was able to get it when it was on sale.
2,Zero customer service,"Although this chair did develop defects, my major complaint is with the third party seller, Moshya Home Furnishings. The defects were cracks in the vinyl beading along the arm rests, starting with one and eventually increasing to a half-dozen. It didn't get really bad until after Amazon's satisfaction guarantee had expired so I was advised to contact the seller through the confidential Amazon email. I did so and attached photos of the spontaneous damage and received no reply. Follow-up week and a half later, same result. Phone call to their ""helpful customer service"" resulted in one ring, then silence. Tried four times, last one waited over five minutes, same result. They apparently only answer orders, not inquiries. Very disappointing from an apparently major Amazon client. Gave it two stars only because the chair is otherwise satisfactory; I only asked for replacement arm rests but their version of customer relations is to ignore the customer."
4,comfy,"Very good chair for the money. Some patience required lining up arm holes, but not difficult.Chair is comfortable, easy to adjust."
3,comfort but hard to put together,"The chair comes into a box that you must assemble. It has detailed instructions how to do it, however it is hard to get the screws in place. I have to admit that the chair is comfortable."
5,El poder del canto,"En este volumen creo importante destacar el Discurso de la Diosa de la Luz, titulado ""Tres Puertas a la Liberación"". Las Puertas a las que se refiere fueron actividades de los Maestros Ascendidos manifestadas en los años treinta las cuales ocurrieron debido a que los estudiantes conscientes acoplaron a sus decretos, cantos a la Presencia ""YO SOY"" y a la Hueste Ascendida.De hecho, cantar es uno de los mejores antídotos para cualquier depresión y sin duda que abre la puerta a buenos sentimientos de parte del prójimo y de la vida elemental que se deleita en la radiación amorosa de un canto elevado a su reino.De ahí el señalamiento de esta Maestra cuando dice en el discurso mencionado, ""¿Me dirá alguo de ustedes que ustedes pueden cantar y no ser felices? De no estar felices y comenzar a cantar, pronto lo estarían. Es poco lo que el mundo exterior ha sabido de lo que el Poder de la verdadera música entraña para el mundo""."
3,"Good movie, terrible DVD","For those that like Medem's work, Tierra is an interesting movie. It is not his greatest movie, but it is an interesting psichological and visual endeavour. His particular visual style (particularily noticeable in Ardilla Roja) begins to show in this movie.Unfortunately, not because of the movie itself (which you might like or dislike depending on wheter you can get in touch with Medem's altered reality), but because of the DVD transfer, this is not a good DVD buy. The transfer is lousy, subtitles are burnt on the image. Being a letterbox transfer, it would make perfect sense to position subtitles on the black bars, and for those of us who can listen to movies in their original language, the option to turn it off. This type of lousy pack-n-go arthouse DVDs, be it from Spain, France or Italy is undeniably cheap and unacceptable."
4,Spanish filmmaking at its best,"I saw this film while a student in Salamanca, Spain. It was a required film of our art classes. I found it to be original in both concept and technique. The camera work is very interesting, creating a place that is not quite real. The shots give the world an almost alien look. The acting is great as well. A very interesting example of Spanish cinema in the 1990s."
2,"Pharrell, Go Back To The Drawing Board","I read Norfeest review and I must say I agree with his write-up 100%. I'll also give Pharrell a two star on this CD but I consider this CD an artist rip-off. I'm also A DJ and I'm from the ATL; I tend to grade hard but I try my best to be honest and fair on my evaluations.The reason I'm calling this an artist rip-off CD; it's typical of an artist like Pharrell, to ride the coattail of pass successes. They'll come in, produce an album while the fire is hot and take the money and run! This is the type of CD that causes people to revert to illegal downloading of MP3's.Two artists in the past year has released albums that does just the opposite of what Pharrell's album has done. And those artists are Mary J. Blige and Mariah Carey. I hope more artists including Pharrell, would take notes on that and more people would pass on downloading that one good song on their CD and buy the whole thang! Nuff said!!!"
2,lovely Irish songs for sober listening,"those who can easily miss pub-atmosphere might enjoy this nicely arranged collection of folk. Zero humor, zero passion.I myself drink 1 pint a month - to underline what I'm missing in this performance. Besides the sound-engineering left some tracks with tape-noises."
1,Horrible!,"This book is not only shallow and vacuous, it is also abysmally poorly written and edited. Whole paragraphs appear several times in the book and seem completely disconnected from anything else. It is like a 7-year-old got into the word processor and had fun with ""copy"", ""cut"" and ""paste"" for an afternoon. I got the feeling that this was simply a very rough first draft that somehow ended up getting rushed to the presses."
2,"Blond is knowlegable, but his editor should be flogged","The initial chapters are pretty decent, with many interesting anecdotes and parentheticals (which I seem to enjoy more than many other reviewers).Unfortunately, the general untidiness of Mr Blond's prose seems to build in a wave, until by the middle of the book (the chapter on Julius Ceasar), it's degenerated almost to the point of being incomprehensible. I've struggled through one additional chapter, the one on Augustus, and it doesn't seem to be getting better. It's uncertain whether I'll be able to finish a book that no longer seems to be printed in English. Really, I blame whoever failed to edit this book.Do yourself a favor - buy a different book."
2,You cannot always judge a book by its title,"As a history buff, I will have to admit to having an interest in all the salacious details from the past. I was very excited, therefore, by the title of the book and the delights which it promised to offer. I was dissappointed, unfortunately. The author does state that he is not doing anything original, which is fine, but he should at least have found an original way to make this history seem fresh in its retelling. The repetition of many of the anecdotes sometimes could make it seem that one was at faculty dinner party with a professor telling you the same story he had just told in class. Also the longest chapter in the book, on Roman food, was neither scandolous nor about the Roman emperors but, even worse, was not particulary captivating. There were interesting elements to the book as the subject is so fascinating but it was not as well put together as I had antipacited based on its mouth watering title."
1,Awful!,"I am not often moved to write reviews, however after squandering a portion of my meager income on this travesty, I feel I must take action. So seldom have I read a book so poorly written and so heavily lacking both in charm and entertainment. Mr. Blond, in a single consecutive abortion of pages, has managed to condense a fascinating and thoroughly entertaining subject into a seething mass of pampas and indecipherable thoughts. The ""author"" of this work seldom sees fit to elaborate on any of the facts presented in the ""book"", much less confine himself to merely one thought per sentence, and instead skips from subject to the next, much like a hyperactive teenager after overdosing on caffeine. Perhaps Blond would be well-served by taking a community-college English course, where the teachers could scold his lack of respect for the readers of his work."
2,Cheaply made - Not enough instructions.,The Windshield tool was cheaply made and the tip broke within 5 minutes of using it on my windshield. Basically there were no useable instructions on the backside of the package. I wouldn't buy again.
4,Heart Changing!,"Not knowing what to expect when I first received my copy, I was so pleased to have learned so much. I never realized the pain and devastation of being abused as a child was so traumatic. I have learned to hold my children closer, and am grateful for the authors braveness in sharing such details. I have loaned out this book, only to find out it keeps getting past on to others. One of the things I have also realized is how many people near me have also been abused. This book helped them open up, and begin healing."
4,Adapt it: Teenagers Can Do It!,"Experiencing God is an excellent study and will greatly impact your life. I have facilitated this course on many occasions, but with teenagers I have found that they do not easily grasp the concepts that are taught in the material. You will need to adapt the leader's guide to fit their unique needs; however, overall it is good. I taught about eight young people two years ago, and they really ""stuck"" with the commitment, moreso than any other group I have led. The key is that they commit to it and the leader make it as fun as possible. Moreover, I encouraged my kids to journal and I was pleasantly surprised at their entries. The sharing of their entries with the rest of the group helped solidify the concepts and also held them accountable to do the lessons each day. Teenagers can do it!"
5,Moog K90477 Camber Adjusting Bolt Kit,excellent products. I should've installed these long ago to bring the front camber back. the tires only lasted a little over two years before these and I shall find out since i just had new tires and this kit installed at the same time.
2,A disappointment - I Should have read the reviews first.,I have used New Riders MCSE Study Guides for all of my Previous Certification Exams and have always found them great. This is a horrible exception. I stumbled acrossed this edition (knowing the first was out of print)and purchased it immediately. The book contains only about 75% of the necessary material. Questions in the practice tests (Measure Up and Transcender)make reference to material nowhere in the book. I have always relied on a couple of good Practice tests and a good third part book to research in order to prep. It has been a successful process that has enabled me to pass every test on the first try and really know the material. But this time I am forced to abandon this book as every 3rd or 4th question is referring to data outside of the scope of this book. I cannot in good consience recommned this book.
1,A waste of paper,"Being a second edition, I thought meant that it would be an improvement over the first. Was I ever wrong.I found the first edition at a used book store and was only looking for something with a newer print date. Instead of adding more material and enhancing it (isn't that the purpose of a 2e?), they chopped it up, reformatted it in wierd columns, and made it worse.Want an analogy? Think New Coke."
1,Why did New Riders put their name to this?,"I am now MCSE, no thanks to this book. Originally I purchased the 4 core exam books by New Riders, and was very impressed with them all. So I decided to stick with New Riders for the TCP/IP and this IIS 4 book, well TCP/IP was very impressive covered all the areas required to pass the exam. Then I read and Studied this book, well most of the questions I was asked were not covered in the book, I had not heard of half of the stuff it was asking me! Definitely do not waste your hard earned money on this ""joke"" of a book. Sorry David not impressed at all."
1,For the birds!!!!,The only reason for buying this book is if you own a bird because it will be usefull for lining the bottom of the cage. The author should be embarassed to have his name associated with this book because it is a complete failure. This book will NOT help you pass the IIS 4 exam. A definite DO NOT BUY!!!!
1,Environmentally Unfriendly,Save a tree and don't purchase this book. It is probably the worst book I've read. I find it hard to believe the author has any experience with IIS because this book doesn't convey any real knowledge in IIS. I'm pretty sure the IIS for Dummies book has more useful information than this book. New Riders should be embarrased by this publication!!
2,A Disappointment,"Personally, I was disappointed as I have read several other books from this publisher which were in my opinion good. This book, however, did not live up to the same standard as the other books in the MCSE series."
2,A major disappointment for this long time Clarks fanatic,"The Clarks have been my favorite band since ""Penny on the Floor"" was first spun on DVE back in the early 90's. I thought they reached their pinnacle with ""Someday Maybe,"" but I had so many high hopes for ""Let It Go."" Unfortunately, this new cd does not live up to any of them. They almost grasp what they are reaching for with ""Snowman,"" ""Highwire,"" and ""Butterflies and Airplanes,"" but the rest of the cd does not justify the price. ""Born Too Late"" sounds much better on the WXDX compilation cd from last year, and the band played ""If Memory Serves"" on a DVE acoustic performance a few months ago that blows the album version away. Songs like ""Flame"" and ""Chasin' Girls"" are just plain bad; I don't understand how the latter was chosen as a single. Bottom line: if you don't have ""Someday Maybe,"" buy it instead. If you do have it, then you'd also better have a lot of patience until the next Clarks disc is released."
5,Hold on to Let It Go,"A top notch album. I caught on to the Clarks after this album was released, but, this album is the one that hooked me. The singles alone are enough to make this album worth buying, but all the songs are actually good, not just the singles.""Better Off Without You"" is such an anthemic kiss-off song that I only wish I'd had it a few years earlier when I really needed something like that and is, without a doubt, my favorite track from ""Let It Go"". BTW, go see a Clarks show. That's what originally got me into them in the first place."
5,Better off with The Clarks,"I was introduced to The Clarks by a friend of mine who absolutely loves them. They are Pennsylvanian band that originally formed in the '80s at IUP, where the members first met. You get sucked into their meusic and lyrics, and it's not easy to pull this cd from your system. The tunes are catchy. They never have the same thing twice, and they do a fantastic job at lyrics. Some musicians focus on love and relationship, but not these guys; check out the first track, ""Snowman."" ""His head is in the clouds, his nose is on the ground'My favorite track is ""Butterflies and Aeroplanes."" It's so upbeat and I end up singing or humming it all day. ""Big ben John Glen and radio waves""The Clarks are one of the few bands that I know that I still great to listen to via recording or live; they have such a stage presence. They're more than happy to be up there singing and jamming for you.Long live The Clarks."
5,The best Clarks release yet,I purchased the new CD the day it was released and it is the best one the Clarks have released to date...they are the 'burgh's best kept secret that should be shared with the world...definately a good investment to add to anyone's collection.
5,Best album i've heard in a long time,This Cd is one of the best cd's i have even heard that has been put out by anyone. If you do not alreday have this cd it is a must. I Would recomened thsi to anyone who likes great music.
4,ONLY THE BEGINING,THIS IS THE THEIR BEST CD YET. I THINK THIS IS THE ONE THAT IS GOING TO MAKE THEM HUGE. FINALLY THIS LOCAL PITTSBURGH BAND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME ROCK LEGENDS. THE SONG (WITHOUT YOU) IS THE SONG THAT IS GOING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE BAND. AND IF YOU LIKE THIS CD YOU WILL LOVE THEIR LIVE CD EVEN BETTER.
4,Birthday Gift for Boyfriend,"There was a small crack on the back cover, but overall was defnitly worth what I paid for it."
5,One of the finest 'Greatest Hits' albums by Gloria Estefan.....,"This is a great anthology of some of the greatest Spanish language hits, by Cuban-born Gloria Estefan. We hear the stunning ""Con Los Años Que Me Quedan,"" taken from Mi Tierra, a soulful and tender ballad that speaks of ""With the Years I Have Left,"" to a lover - who wouldn't melt, listening to this? Even if you don't speak Spanish, I guarantee you will fall in love with opening chords, all the way to the last note of the song. ""Por Amor,"" ""Hoy,"" and the rest of the songs are all great ways to get to know Gloria and what makes her so beloved by her fans. There really isn't a bad tune on here, at all. We have everything from fast, salsa numbers to love songs, guaranteed to move your soul."
5,Awesome Album!,Another great compilation of Gloria's music! The duets were new to me & I really enjoyed all three. Highly recommend!
3,story of an ABC News investigative producer in Beirut,"This book is rather a well-written ""fiction"". It describes the involvement of Barbara Newman in Middle Eastern politics when she was doing a segment for 20/20 in the early 1980's. The book describes her experiences during the Beirut civil war. Her love affair with the commander-in-chief of the Lebanese christian forces, Beshir Gemayel, ended with the latter's assassination three weeks after being elected Lebanese president"
3,A masterpiece,"it's a good book that our grammar school teacher made us read. the ending was funny for some of the school pranksters in my class and that lead to a parody that our class made in 5th grade. good times. There's is a lot of energy from the characters, I can't wait for a sequel!"
3,It's beautiful but sparse,"This book is good if you haven't done much in flash. It has a beautiful layout and great (looking) examples, but doesn't do much in the way of in depth flash. Very little action script is applied to animations outside of the game example at the end. The best thing I got out of this book was a reference to www.miniml.com :)"
2,I don't get it...,Maybe it's just me but there are quite a few broken links that is featured in this book. That's kind of understandable because companies do change sometimes but when the reference web site that is associated with the book is also non-functional you have a problem.
2,Book is in poor condition,I've received the book that took 3 weeks to arrive (when the seller told me 1) and it was it poor condition. At least I've got it. M
3,not bad,"The baby loved thses toys when they worked, 2 out of the 3 malfunctions within the first day. The third one has very little volume left to it."
4,Great glove!,I have purchased 3 of these gloves for myself and fellow teammates. They have all been great and lasted through 3 seasons.Great for 12inch softball!
5,Great mitt for softball,This is the first sports glove I have purchased and I am playing softball. My husband and I are actually sharing the glove right now and as a seasoned baseball player he says that the glove is very padded and feels great. He has huge hands so the fact that we are both able to comfortably wear this is definitely a plus in my book. I have only had the glove for a month now with 2 games per week so I can't comment on the durability but so far we love it.
2,Can't break it in!,"When I originally bought the glove I thought it was a good buy. I did, however, have problems breaking it in at first and thought that the ball tended to bounce out of the glove a little too much; the glove appeared stiff. I thought that it would break in with time but after 1 year it is still pretty stiff. Someone told me that ""Genuine"" Leather was one of the worst materials for a glove and I can confirm that after not being able to break the glove in after a year of use."
5,Great Glove and It didn't Break the Bank,"37 years old and just started playing softball with co-workers. All I had was the glove I used in little league. I wanted a much bigger glove but I wasn't going to pay a lot for it. Saw this same glove at KMart for about the same price but being that I'm left handed they didn't have any for me. Ordered from Amazon. The glove came quick. It was still in the box when I got to the ballpark. Used it right away and it felt great. No break-in required, plenty of padding in the palm, and just a great fit. Some reviewers complained about the straps ring breaking but I have adjusted my glove once and have never had to fidget with it again. I've played about 7 games with it now and have had about 4 practices with no problems at all. I'm just as entusiastic about the glove now as I was that first day I took it out of the box."
1,"Frowning on the ""frownies""",The frownies are made of cheap paper with cheap glue. I wet them and stuck them on. Slept with the things on for a few days. I did not see a difference in my frown line. Quackery!
1,don't waste your money,This is a waste of money. Basically nothing more than paper with glue on it. It's terrible and doesn't work. Do you want to wear tape on your face to bed? Ugh...don't think so
5,Great for learning more than just patterns,I've been playing guitar for over 40 years. I knew about the pentatonic scale but didn't know how to use it. Desi breaks it down string by string and shows you how to put it all together. Then he shows practical uses of the pentatonic scale in songs that even I know. This is the DVD to get if you are confused about the pentatonic scale.
4,A SERGIO MARTINO SLEEPER,"The ever surprising Italian film enthusiasts at MYA communications have unearthed a wonderfully erotic gem from director Sergio Martino. Just when you think its an erotic pot boiler, it slowly slides into Giallo territory with a tense climax. Quality is crystal clear in full screen format with English soundtrack. For fans who have never experienced the films of Sergio Martino, this is a good place to start."
4,a bit of an irony,"Jackie's recent admittance that he had a fling with an ex Miss HK pageant & produced a child outside the wedlock comes as an irony to this book which potrays him as a true gentleman. I believe most Asian people grow up with Jackie. When he was hurted during filming, we felt for him. When he striked gold in America, we were happy for him. In a way, he represented what we Asians aspire to be, going all the way. His portrayal of an average Joe Blogg, the guy who lives across the street stick with us for as long as I can remember. I just hope that his success doesn't make him feel invincible so that he could do as he wish. He should be aware of the Greek tragedy that if you fly too close to the sun, you will get burnt irrespective of who you are. It would be good if the 2nd edition of the book addresses his rationality behind his affair providing that his wife has been supportive of him through his whole career."
5,FASCINATING AND INSPIRING,"What a great book! Before reading this book, I didn't know much about Jackie Chan except that he made clean, fun, entertaining movies. I admire the fact that he is just about the only successful Asian movie star in American films, and bought this book to see how he broke through. And what a story it is! This is one of those books that you will remember and draw upon forever. Mr. Chan illustrates how far hard work and determination can take you. My 10 year old son was amazed when I told him about Jackie's childhood. It's nice to have a positive, clean role model for our kids to look up to!"
5,Any Real Fan's Delight,I Am Jackie Chan is a very well done autobiography. There are lots of pictures encompassing Jackie's entire career and childhood. Lots of crazy stories from Jackie's life...if you love Jackie you'll love this book!
4,I am Jackie Chan - My life in Actopm,"After reading this book on Jackie Chan I am truly amazed that he survived his early childhood, but it has made me appreciate all the efforts he uses to make sure his movies are funny and action packed. I know that I could not have gone thru what he did in the Chinese Opera Schools. This book had a lot of pictures of him as a young boy and of his parents. Well worth reading to know about one of your favorite actors."
4,Dog likes this bed a lot,"We bought this bed as a place for our young puppy to learn to sit or lay quietly when she is with us. She likes it a lot and willingly ""climbs"" onto the bed. The only complaint that I have at all is that it maintains ""puppy smell"" more than I anticipated. We did not choose a furry or fuzzy dog bed with the hope to avoid that issue."
5,Perfect Bed for Puppy chewers!,"This is our 2nd bed for our 9 mth old german shep/lab puppy. She has 1 in the bedroom and 1 in her crate. This is the only bed she won't/can't chew - and if they do, Kuranda will replace the materials (for up to 1 year I believe). We have even donated some of these beds to shelters in the area. Easy to clean (vac or wet cloth) and fits in her crate perfectly. HIGHLY recommend for anyone."
4,Too large!,"They are wonderful shoes, but run too large. I ordered size 3s and they are huge on my daughter! I think my 8-month-old daughter needs size 1 or 2. It is a pain to return them, so I guess I am keeping them for later and ordering smaller ones."
1,not for chubby legged girls!,"these are super cute, BUT WILL NOT STAY ON CHUBBY-LEGGED babies!!! the leg opening, although featuring velcro, does not adjust properly to keep them on!"
3,Cute but....,These are so adorable and my son got a million compliments on them but they are made a size larger than he wears in other shoes and THEY WILL NOT STAY ON HIS FEET! Not to mention how slick the bottom is without rubber to grip! Not for walking in... Dangerous! But we ended up losing one somewhere while shopping because they constantly came off while he as just in his stroller. Someone out there has found one really cute moccasin.
3,Great for toddlers but good luck getting the right size.,"Babe wears a size five in most other shoes. Followed the advice of other reviews (order one size down) and ordered a size four in these. I'd say there's a full inch from the tip of his toes to the toe of the shoe. Like so big he can't cruise in them without tripping and having them get caught up on each other. Perfect little booties though. Soft suede, flexible sole and go on easily. Love them enough to order a three and put the fours on the shelf for later. Highly recommended - just watch the sizing."
5,Very cute!,"Love the boots, they are so cute. Can't wait for my daughter to wear them. They are exactly what I thought they would be."
4,Super cute...pink is hot pink not pastel like pictured!,"These booties are adorable, but just a heads up the shoes I received were hot pink/magenta not baby pink like pictured. I am fine with this cause they will show less dirt."
4,Love these!,They are as adorable as they are comfy - my tot loves 'em! We're always getting compliments - not quite Robeez durablilty but very nice none the less :)
5,Adorable,Ordered for my 2month old god daughter they are a lil big but I love them!! Great booties for children
3,way too big,"These moccasins are nicely made and very cute, but the sizing is WAY off. After reading the other reviews, I ordered a size 2 for my 11-month-old (who is not on the small side) and I'm returning them for a size 1."
3,Beware of Sizing,"I ordered a pair of these to complete my daughter's Indian costume for Halloween. They were very cute and perfect color (brown). However, they were WAY too big. I followed the advice of previous purchasers and ordered a size down. My daughter wears size 6, almost a 6 1/2, so I ordered a 5. Even with thick socks they were still too big. Packaged up and returned to Amazon."
1,Run large and do not stay on childs feet,I thought these boots were nice but when I received them they ran so large I ordered the smaller size and they were still to big. They do not stay on child's feet I am hope he grows into them but i think that they run so large around the ankle that he will prolly never use them.
4,adorable but runs MUCH TOO LARGE,"I ordered a size 3 for my 12 month old, and they were HUGE. I will exchange for a size 2 instead. Otherwise, very cute! Order a size down. I read the reviews and still wasn't sure, so I went with her normal size. Should have gone w/ my instinct and gone down a size."
1,DO NOT BUY,I ordered these and besides running WAY to big they were dirty. On top of my disappointment they charged me a shipping fee to send back. I'm very disappointed because i normally like this brand.Minnetonka Infant/Toddler 1187 Hook-And-Loop Boot
4,Super cute,"Bought these for my 4 month old son, and they are super cute! He receives so many compliments when he wears them. I do wish the back had more flexibility to it so they are easier to make them tighter and for my son to keep them them on."
2,"Color is completely different, beware!","I ordered these shoes not only because their adorable, but I love the pale pink color. When I opened the box yesterday I found that they are bright, hot pink, not the pale pink that is pictured. I'm pretty sure that this is the new color that Minnetonka uses, but I thought that since I was buying from Amazon, it would be the color advertised. I am returning them and now looking at sites like ebay to find the pale pink color."
4,Great product,"These are great shoes for your baby, we have twins and have been using them for some time.We lost one shoe the other day, it fell off.You must pay attention when lifting up the baby in public places as the shoe tend to slip off easily, and yes were the rite size we bought a size smaller and a size bigger and they just tend to slip off.But I do recommend them as they are made well and stay on as long as your toddler is standing in them."
4,a solid follow up to the debut,"Not as catchy or fun as the first release by this rock band, but certainly still worth getting. This band is for fans of jesus lizard, shellac, etc."
2,Incorrect Fit,"Claimed it would fit a 1999 Jetta, but it does not. Not even close to the right shape. I also note there seems to be some minor convex curve to the original mirror but this product is just a flat piece of (mirror) glass. Seems like strong glass, but it doesn't fit so that's irrelevant."
2,Not best but will do,"I ordered this mirror to replace one on my daughters Jetta that broke. The packaging looked professional and it arrived intact. However, the edges of the mirror were somewhat chipped. It will fit in the spot but looks a little rough around the edges. Before the price I expected a smooth mirror edge. The two double stick tape pads don't look like they will hold the mirror secure so I will probably use construction adhesive. Because it fits and the car is old I will keep it. If it was for one of my newer cars I would have returned it."
5,Great book and great transaction,I received this book very quickly in order to have it for a class on group tours. The book contains useful information for putting together tours and I will definitely keep it and use always it when booking tours.
3,Heartwarming (for better or worse),"Father Jean Gautier recounts anecdotes from his three-year association with Yuni, his poodle, and muses on the relationships among dog, man, and God. A short, straightforward, readable book. Dog lovers should find this book particularly to their liking."
4,Spooky Hotel,"If you love black & white horror movies with a lot of atmosphere and good acting, don't miss this one. My only false note come from the quality of this DVD that is not first rate but watchable. GQ."
3,"Gorgeous quilt, tricky transfers.","I wish the book simply included the iron-on transfers. That would be very expensive, I imagine. As it is, transfer paper that runs through an inkjet printer costs almost $5/page. You'll need 18 pages to create the transfers. With my brand new HP printer, I couldn't get the colors right (much more green than the blue pictured in the book). When I tested the transfers, I could not get the quality I had hoped for. I haven't used computer-generated transfers before, but this was an expensive experiment.That said, the quilt is so beautiful that I'm planning to take the cd-rom to a copy shop and have them run the transfers on their inkjet, and hope for better results. Or I may use the transfer areas for redwork or other embroidery.The quilt is absolutely stunning, the picture on the cover doesn't do it justice. If you like to have beautiful quilt books just to thumb through and daydream, I highly recommend adding this to your collection."
4,almost,nice boot except for edge of leather digging in to instep and had to exchange due to broken stitching
3,"Good Boots, Bad Buckles","Bought a pair of these boots in April 19, 2010, decided not to write feedback until I had worn them for a time. They fit well and looked great. The lower part of the boot, not made of leather I believe, wore rather fast and I am not that terribly rough on them. About a month ago, the lower buckle broke. When I got them, the buckles seemed a bit cheap so I wasnt shocked that one broke. In the end, a little over a year of wear and they are looking very rough around the toe and one boot has a broken buckle. I am now on Amazon looking for a new pair. I know they are not quite as expensive as other boots but did expect them to stand up to wear better and last a bit longer."
2,Content Okay - Presentation Poor,"As a previous reviewer suggested, the printing quality of this book is very poor. Every word in each row of the right hand column has been cut off, leaving the reader to guess what should come next. Additionally, this is not a book that is meant to be published in paperback, this is especially evident in the chapter on color, which of course has absolutely no color, but references color wheels (in black and white mind you) and asks you to view images that are meant to show gradations in hue, etc.! One can work through these obstacles, but with a $50+ price tag, you shouldn't have to. The only reason I did not return my copy, was because I needed it for a class in which I was already behind."
2,Not worth the price,"When I first bought this book, I expected to get more out of it in terms of designing web pages with users in mind. It focused a lot on setting up testing centers with a paper system and getting feedback from users. It was very brief on good web design techniques (doesn't cover navigation enough). The hands on exercises leaves something to be desired. Although there were some good ideas in this book, I found myself ""hanging"" at the end as if there should have been much more."
1,User Centered Website Development,Worst text book I have ever seen. Looks like it was made in someones garage with an old copy machine. I really enjoyed the chapter on color printed in black and white.
2,WARNING: Tasty SALT Soup,"I ordered this from Amazon. Unfortunately, the description did not include nutrition facts. Guess what? There are 4 servings per package and 800 mg. of salt in EACH serving. That's right, there are 2,400 mg. of sodium in one package. Had I known this I never would have ordered it. Sure it's tasty, because it's so full of salt! This soup is just plain unhealthy. I will not be ordering it or eating it again."
2,NOT QUALITY YOU EXPECT,"Sadly, I had to return this item to Amazon. It looked good it the item descriptions but in person it was very lightweight and much like the 7.99 fry pans at Walmart. Amazon did take it back but I lost shipping charges. Be aware if you are considering this item."
3,Picture is mis-leading,"Good cable but the picture was mis-leading, I though I was getting a five pack."
5,tremenda lectura,"""La vida ese parentesis"" nos permite ver diversos aspectos de la vida urbana, con sus deleites y dolores, complicaciones y simplicidades.Decir Benedetti es decir unos de los mejores poetas hispanos vivos; y este libro, como sus otros trabajos -que ya rebasan los 70 libros-, son lisa y llana prueba de ello.""La vida ese parentesis"" para mi fue una eleccion apropiada, en lo que a poesia contemporanea refiere. Lo recomiendo con gusto como un excelente libro de poemas.Don Benedetti siempre hace pensar, y ademas, utiliza un sentido del humor muy particular, mientras pone el dedo en las llagas de la sociedad enferma, de la cual somos parte de manera ineludible -aunque no en todo responsables por sus virtudes y desgracias, claro está.(Para una antologia poetica espiritual, de la pluma de los grandes literatos españoles e hispanoamericanos, vea:Pulpito y Poesia: Recursos poeticos para la predicacion, la ensenanza y la devocion espiritual)"
2,Suz Andreasena,"Here it is - her (Suz Andreasea's) own statement to me when I did not approve of my little $125 purchase, NO red stones - take it to heart buyers.From Suz to me, a Customer: ""I can only assume you are color blind and have never seen real gemstones in your life because your comments were completely out of line""Hmmmm...I will be glad to show the photo of what I received on paper for return purposes - a Birthday gift by the way. This is such a waste of my time."
5,Exceptional series for kids,"This is one of my favorites in Meiners' Learning to Get Along series. It explains the purpose of going to school, and what paying attention looks like for children who have difficulty with these concepts. The illustrations are done well, and I'd recommend this for parents, caregivers, and teachers of children with autism or other social difficulties."
3,Extra large indeed!,The bag is great but unfortunately I had to return it as it really was too big for me. It would be great for a large and tall person who wants to carry a lot of items!
4,Hold what I need it to hold,"I originally had a medium size bag, and wore it out. I moved up to extra large because I now carry both my Kindle 2 and my Kindle Fire, as well as bus maps and schedules, reading glasses, a change purse for cash and coins and various small articles. This product seems excellent and so far has given me no trouble whatsoever."
3,"It's OK, not really a ""Children's"" fanny pack","The size of the pouch is small, true. But the waist strap is totally ginormous and clearly designed for an adult. At the absolutely tightest setting, it was still way too big for my 3 year old boy. Not a big deal - we figured out a way to use some hair ties to cinch it - but it's really falsely advertised as a kid item.Also the buckle that snaps the two sections of waist strip together is touchy. It doesn't work both ways. You have to make sure you're doing it right or else it'll get jammed. Very hard to describe on amazon, but inserting the male portion of the snap into the female portion has to be done one of two ways, or you have a problem. We did it wrong once and wound up having to file down the plastic to be able to uninsert it.Would still recommend at this price."
3,Everest Fanny Pack,"I bought this for my husband. We have bought this exact one for him before. The first one lasted about 2 years. It ripped out where the zipper is sewn to the material. The way the 2nd one is made, the inside lining edge gets caught in the zipper frequently when he tries to zip it. He says if this rips, we won't be buying this brand again."
3,Perfect for Preschoolers but not any older than that,"I can't emphasize enough how TINY these are! Make sure you look at the dimensions and use a ruler so you know what size to expect.They were perfect for my 3 and 4 year olds, but too small for my 8 year old. I was able to fit a miniture flashlight, child-sized pen, chapstick, pocket spiral notebook and an emergency card. I could not fit store bought snacks in it. Maybe if I made my own snack with a sandwich bag it might have fit because I could control the size of the snack, but it would have been tight. And it is hard to get anything out of it if it's stuffed too full. So again, it's quality material and a great TINY product!"
1,Impossible to use,"Terrible product. It broke before my daughter ever got to use it. The buckle is curved so that if it snaps back to front, it will never come undone. It's for children. How can a child get it right every time without even a warning that it will only work one way? They can't. This is a worse than worthless product."
2,Children's fanny pack,"This product was too small for the intended use; for my lady to carry a 38 cal pistol while jogging---The dimensions provided were misleading...had the main zipped pocket been 8 inches wide, it would have been large enough. Alas, that is the overall width, including the strap attachment flaps, and the pocket is much smaller.Item discarded as shipping cost exceeds product cost."
5,Disney World life savers!,"I took two of these with us to Disney World. My 5 year old wore one and the other was passed around by adults. For my 5 year old it held his sun glasses, a pack of peanut butter crackers, a hand full of tootsie pops (great for long lines) a Micky Mouse Pez, and his park tickets. These packs are REALLY small and the front pocket really only held his park ticket. The back pocket is deeper then it looks and held more then I expected. The strap is Really big and will adjust up to any size and will also adjust all the way down to fit the smallest child. The Navy was great for the adults and looked fine."
1,It was tiny!,"I thought it was going to be a lot larger, and it was the wrong color. Buy this in the store!"
5,great for kids,great for kids. Bought these for my grandchildren. Just the right size for younger ones. Has enough pockets to store some of their favorites things plus a dollar or two.
3,"Very, Very Small","I bought these packs for my kids to take on vacation, planning to use them for a gameboy and a few snacks. They are tiny! Good if your looking for something to carry a few very small items like keys & a candy bar."
1,Poor quality/design,"In less than a week of owning this fanny pack, it has jammed and come completely apart. This pack is the perfect size for a child. I purchased it for my 9yr old daughter who has juvenile diabetes and needs to carry around a small juice box and her blood sugar meter. The size is perfect for our needs. Unfortunately, if you buckle it upside down (which is so easy to do, the strap is huge), it jams and has to be taken apart with pliers. We showed her how to watch when she buckles it so that doesn't happen again and that has worked. Then, one side of the strap came completely apart from the fanny pack. She isn't doing anything rough with it so not sure why that would happen. We used a sewing machine to get it back together but I wonder how long until it breaks again. I plan to contact the seller, no comment on customer service yet. It's a low investment but I would expect a product like this to last longer than a week."
4,Good solid product,"I have no grips with the quality of the materials or the workmanship. It appears the fanny pack will last a long time; however, I do take slight issue with the term ""X-Large"" as I don't think it is all that big. As long as you are aware that the size is really not very large (for holding stuff); you are fine. You can put a small water bottle in it and a few sundries, but don't push it."
5,Worth having in your collection!,"I love this pan! A family member is having a baby shower, and I was asked to make the cake. She really wanted the Wilton open Book style pan. I was happy to find it on Amazon for $18, since it seems to be discontinued in the stores. It is supposed to be a 2-mix pan, but the directions clearly state that you need to use 3 cake mixes.I took 3 cakes mixes, and I mixed them individually, then poured each one into the pan. The recipe also states that you bake the cake on the 3rd rack from the bottom.. but you should always bake a cake in the middle rack of your oven, that is properly calibrated. The temperature should be 350. It took my almost exactly 70 minutes to bake this cake. The recipe says 60-70. I checked it after 60. There wasnt much to shave off the top either, which was nice. I got nothing but positive reviews on my cake."
4,Awesome idea,"I am a school librarian, and this will be perfect for lots of occasions. I received it very fast, and although the instructions/decorating tips were not included, I have found them online."
4,a review by the librarian's husband,"I bought this for my wife, a librarian- well, for me, really, since I'm the one who ends up doing all the baking.I'll admit that I was skeptical. How was the middle going to cook before he thin edges burned? But, the wife said she needed book shaped cakes, and maybe the folks on Ace of Cakes can sculpt a cake with a knife, I certainly can't. Call it a cheat. This thing works, and yellow cake, at least, comes out clean and ready for icing.The pan cleans up easy, too, which is a boon."
5,Bigger than expected,When I saw this pan I wasn't sure how big it would be but happy when I got it that it is plenty big enough for my daughters birthday party. My wife is going to use it to create a Super Why birthday cake.
2,Grandpa's 5001 on QVC,"The price of $49.49 for this book is extremaly to high. People who paid almost $50 for this book should have done research before buying it.The QVC channel is selling this book for less than $18.00 (still to much $$$) but I decide to buy one anyhow. BIG MISTAKE!!Sorry Grandpa and Dr. Bad-er, this book is very BAAAD! Not a good purchase at all. It's more common sense than secrets.So...the so called ""5001 Handyman Secrets"" book is going back to QVC as soon as I finish writing this review.... And that's a fact, not a secret!"
1,"Shoddy material definite ""no buy""",I purchased two of these books and I am stunned at the poor quality of the editing; in twenty minutes I found forty typos and incomplete sentences that had a direct impact on the success of the 'hints' offered.Some hints if they may be called that were quite ridiculous and are copies of others that have come before or are in pamphlets that routinely come with product. And yet Dr. Myles H. Bader thinks he can have a copyright on these 'secrets' when he obviously accessed them from other sources himself. He surely could not think that anyone would want to copy his questionable grammar and deplorable spelling.I am forced to rate this book with a single star in order to leave a review-- it is not worth even a single star.Sign me Crabby!
1,STILL WAITING,"We took the bait and ordered this book (not through Amazon) BEFORE Christmas 2009. I had totally forgotten about it until I see a charge for $38.95! Apparently they charge S&H on each book, separately. Or I GUESS that's what they did. I cannot be certain since - as of this writing on 2/21/2010 I STILL have not received the books. I went to the web site and the contact page for customer service is no longer available. Something tells me the company has packed up and moved on. Yeah, I feel like a sucker!"
1,Something is shady,"Grandpa's 5,002nd secret is that you will be a fool to buy his book. I was half asleep when I saw the informercial and researched several internet strings before finding a site to the book. When I attempted to purchase the book however, my spyware would not allow me to move forward. The message stated that the site was not protected. The site address only stated ""as on tv"", not ""as seen on tv"". Be careful if you try to buy from a direct site. There were no other links and after reading the reviews on Amazon, I am so glad that I had problems with the transaction."
1,I'd rather eat a fart!,"This movie is a peice of junk. The anamation's so boring, it makes Squidward look like a perky, goofy person. In with the old, Out with the new!"
1,Awful!!!,"I came across this on tv the other day and I was appalled! The only reason I kept watching it was because I wanted to see who the Toy Taker was. I cannot believe they tried to continue it in an animated fashion rather than the claymation/stop motion style of the original. It looked like someone decided one day to write a quick script, and throw things together in time for the holidays. The quality is just not there. And they made it an hour an a half long! I was definitely disappointed."
1,Poor attempt to capitalize on proven masterpiece....,"It is sad to see such a family classic being pimped out this way in recent years. If you tell a story correctly there is nothing to merit a sequel, especially one that was slapped together using cheap computer animation techniques rather than the time tested Animagic process. You will only be adding to the growing cash pile of greedy executives if you buy this film, which will surely result in many more sequels to come. Where will it end? ""Attack of the Rudolph Clones""? ""The Rudolph franchise that wouldn't die""? Come on. If you want to see the TRUE Rudolph ""Sequels"" go buy ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" or ""Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July"", but leave this stinker alone."
1,A Misfit of A Movie,"This is an abomination to the entire film industry and a disgrace and insult to the original 1964 classic. The animation looks like some amateur bought a 'CGI For Dummies' book and made it on their home computer. Like other users remarked there is no texture to the images, the graphics look like something out of a cheap children's video game, in which the paper thin plot would have been more suitable for. Gosh, the 30 second AFLAC commercial that spoofed Rudolph had more production value than this 90 minutes of gutter trash! This had so much potential to be a decent sequel but greed, as always in modern movie making, killed it with a slapped together rush job all for the sake of capitalizing off the Rudolph franchise and the integrity of the original!"
3,For kids: Not adults wanting to be kids again,"I was originally disappointed by this movie. (...)I was expecting high quality dialogues and music. Everything was pretty simplistic. There wasn't a very ""christmasy"" feel to it, either.The up side: My two year old loved it and sat through the whole thing, then immediately wanted to watch it again.If you're looking for a nostalgic movie that will take you back, then save your money. If you want something the kids will love and will keep them occupied while you bake for the neighbors, then this is a good pick."
3,Not For Staunch Fans of the Classics.....but Kids Love It!!!,"As far as Im concerned, this computer generated work does not at all belong in the same collection as the pain staking efforts of the stop-motion animation classics. It would have been interesting if they would have combined computer generation with stop-motion animation. It did bring a smile to my face seeing the classic characters again. They did manage to make it a sequel by tying in Ukon Cornelius's Peppermint Mine as well as several other events throughout the duration of the film. So,what are the reasons for buying this? My daughter's loved it!!! If it makes them happy, it makes me happy. The DVD also has a special feature to print out some really cool Christmas cards of those classic Rankin/Bass characters.I would rate it a one star, but because my kids give it a five star, ill give it a three star. Ha! Ha! Merry Christmas to All, and to All a Good Night!"
2,Please bring back the real Rudolph,"This was a great story however the ""stat of the art"" animation looked like they spent about half the time of the production of your typical Saturday animated cartoon and the new songs were very annoying. (Very cheap how they put the bumble in the rabbit suit so they did not have to animate his fur.)When I picked this out I thought that it would be cool cause the computer stuff looks exactly like the clamation that they used in the original on (except for Santa and the snowman). But they turned out to be very cheaply done.Most 4 year olds will like it however but if you like the other movies of the Rudolph series (which I do) you can't get into this one good."
4,My Daughter loves it,We just purchased this movie the other day and my daughter sat and watched the whole thing. She said she loved it. We gave her this one and Snowed in at the house of mouse as pre-christmas presents. I only gave this 4 stars because I gave house of mouse 5 stars and I think that is a better movie. My daughter loves them both.
1,Not Worth Renting or Buying,"I have the original Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer that was produced by Rakin-Bass. They did the puppet version which was cute, had a great story line and nice music. I watch it every Christmas. This movie which is a continuation is just terrible. I didn't like the story behind it and it lost my interest. It just didn't seem like it would be for little kids. It just lost something being computer generated. The only thing I liked about it was the Snowman. I also didn't like the idea of they had for one character wanting to change their looks. That is not what we want our children hear that if they don't like what they look like they can go somewhere to change it. They also had to many songs that were just corny. In my opinion stick with the original version of Rudolph by Rankin-Bass."
2,Well enough alone,"I cannot believe that some level of management actually approved to spend money to produce this major but unnecessary project. Clearly a lot of effort went into making it but it is an overwrought and underwhelming gilding of the lily. The old one was fine, simple and charming. This one is complicated and frankly a bit stressful. This was more a platform for computer animation stunts than a childrens' Christmas flick.I just ordered the original for my under 7 year old four kids for next year. This new version just went in the bin. Fortunately it was a great buy. But . . . you get what you pay for."
2,Rather Bizarre,"It is very strange to hear what sound like the original voices in this CGI presentation. We watched with a group of older Rudolph fans (so we had to imagine what it would be like if we had not seen the original). Someone commented at one point that they thought we had drifted into a 60s psychedelic trip of some kind. I agree. It is a strange movie to say the least. I can't say that we hated it, but we definitely didn't like it. It's sort of like an accident where you want to turn away but just can't. We don't recommend it."
1,not a good buy,"the rudolph the rednose reindeer and the island of misfits was a disappointment because i ordered the engligh version and got the spanish version and it would not play in my dvd player either,"
3,Needs A Better Title...but,"The title should be Rudolph and the Mystery of the Toy Taker. Or something along those lines. It really was an OK movie. The CGI was amateurish compared to more modern offerings, but considering the time period, it is not so bad. The original Rudolph is beloved because...it is a ""classic"" and had cool animation for the time period, not because it was an example of particularly brilliant storytelling... It is really just a lame feel good kid's Christmas program, nothing more, nothing less. Older kids will pick it apart and tear it to shreds; little kids will love it. (My kids loved it until they got to be about 10 years old. LOL)"
5,Great Kids Movie,I love all the animated Christmas movies. They take you to a make believe world where there is no stress or fighting. I watch all of them every year regardless of how old I am. My children loved them and now my grandchildren love the tradition. Those people who complain about the movie take all the aspects too serious. It's a cartoon ! ! ! !
3,Can't beat the original,"I am sure all ages will enjoy this DVD, but it does not beat the original Ruldoph the Red Nose Reindeer. I would not waste my money on this, and would purchase the original one."
5,"You will hate it, your kids will love it","I'm telling you I have known more kids who love this ridiculous movie. The songs are simplistic and annoyingly repetitive. The movie looks like a Playstation game. I don't know what the attraction is, maybe subliminal messages? Whatever it is kids love it and every adult I know hates it too. Basically like 50% of everything else my kids watch."
1,Rudolphthe red-nosed... You Would even say this movie BLOWS!,"If I could give this movie 0 stars I would. Why'd they change the animation? It's not Rudolph without the claymation( or whatever it was called). This CGI crud(the only nice word for it) is ruining our movies!!! The story has no physical depth or texture.. Rudolph isn't furry like he's supposed to be. And if this is supposed to be a sequel, why does Santa look completely different? This movie stinks!!!!!!!!! I'm only 13, but I know good movies(not this new junk they're trying to show us)"
1,Is this a joke?,This is NOT a sequel to the classic RANKIN/BASS TV Special. It is a horrible attempt to make $ off of something that was created by talented people by untalented people.
1,Disappointed,"One of my favorite things about christmas when I was young was watching Rudolph and the Island of Misfit Toys on the television. So, when I say that it had been released I bought it. As soon as I watched it, I was EXTREMELY disappointed. They replaced the lovable stop-motion classic with a low-rent computer animation. Not only is it not stop motion anymore but the animation is horrible. Maybe if it resembled something like Toy Story it would be more entertaining but the rendering of the animation was so simple that i felt like I was watching something that a beginning animation student made. If you enjoyed the original Rudolph then don't buy this becuase you will just be disappointed."
1,a sad attempt,"At a glance, the character models in this computer animated follow-up are true to the originals...but that's where the charm ends. The story, editing, camera moves, animation, and rendering in this show are poor, at best. A young child might find THE ISLAND OF MISFIT TOYS enjoyable, but if you grew up with the original stop-motion specials and you're looking for nostalgic entertainment, please look elsewhere.All the best elements are borrowed from the original Rankin/Bass specials. All the new character designs are lame. Plus, Rudolph's relapse into deep depression over his misfit nose gets old, really quick. There's nothing humorous about it and he comes across more as a pathetic whiner.Stick with the originals...this weak effort, destined for obscurity, will only disappoint. Hardcore fans will be mortified."
5,Kids love it!!,The first Rudolph animated movie is pale in comparison to this one. OK it may be sugary sweet but your kids (under 9) will love it. Why people pour scorn on this version is beyond me. Maybe they should have left it to their kids to review it!
1,BEWARE! NOT ORIGINAL!!! LOOK FOR BURL IVES!,"We bought this video expecting it to be the one we watched as children. As our two year old watched it, we cringed!!! Where was Burl Ives????? We felt cheated until we realized that this was a different edition. Aside from the trickery of playing off our nostalgia, we hated the DVD because it was creepy-sing-songy and NOT what we wanted for our little girl. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! LOOK FOR BURL IVES IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO BUY!!"
1,Buy the original - not this version!!!,"Very simple - Do not buy this! Buy the 1964 ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" original. There is no reason to buy this version."
1,Awful,"This really is awful- nothing like the original and very unsettling to watch. I DVRed this, thinking it was the old, stop-motion movie. What a HUGE disappointment!"
2,The Not So Classic...Rudolph,"The quality of computer animation lags behind that of many of the movies on the market. The animals and characters lack texture and style. Special effects such as the ocean and snow flying up into the air made me feel more like I was watching animation from a Nintendo 64. The video quality gets 2 stars.For the cast of some bigger celebrities of their time, Jamie Lee Curtis, Richard Dreyfus and Rick Moranis, the movie was worth a look.Music and sound quality is good. Many of the songs were very good. The storyline is decent and kept my daughter entertained. The mystery of the villain at the end of the movie was a big disappointment. Additionally, rather than bringing spirit and cheer, this movie is another spin off from the Grinch by Dr. Seuss.For the entertainment of a child less than 6, the movie is at best acceptable. For anyone else, don't bother."
2,Wish the author read the previous books...,"I was looking forward to a new L5R novel, especially after Wind of Honor, which I thought was a great book. Wind of War managed to disappoint me on soooo many levels. Outside jokes (the village of ""Rutro Ragi""), poor characterizations of established characters, poor grasp on a developed setting, and repeated use of the same metaphors (how many times can an author say ""the opponent fell to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut) all contributed to a book that was frequently painful to read.I'll pick up future books for the setting, but I'll hesitate to pay for another book by this author."
5,Risk taking at it's best!,"I'm not going to address this other review, as I completely disagree with this other readers assessment of ""Wind of War"". I have read the other L5R books, and I think this author takes a great risk with his imaginitive style, and unique story telling ability. The book is great, entertaining, and I will buy any other books this author writes in the future. It is such a great read, and I highly recommend it! Great job Jess Lebow!"
3,Journey for the North Star,I would recommend this book to people who enjoy nonfiction and like to read about slavery. Then if you don't like slaverythen I wouldn't recommend this book to you. The purpose of the book is to inform you of what fugitive slaves had to go through during the time of slavery. The summary of theis book is: Slaves were sold off to people for little money at all. After a while they tried to run away. After a while some of then were allowed to leave because of some reasons wether it be because of family matters or just their owners allowed then to leave.Kelly M.
3,"Tried to buy several,see it is not available","I have had a original one of these. Looks just like the one shown in Picture. Those are great original Bach CT/MPA. Worked really well and easy to remove,due to the Bach Hex head design.The last three I have tried to order from this Company and it's Sister companys. Will send another type adapter,when you complain,say they will send the correct one. You get to keep the one sent.Will send another of the same. These fake Bach ones can get stuck in your mouthpiece receiver and will be hard to remove. The end is rounded out like a old vintage Conn Mouthpiece receiver. They do not have the 6 sided hex head like the original Bach mouthpiece receiver end or the picture shown above.Horn players will know what I am talking about. If that is the New Bach Adapter,the picture should be changed to reflect exactly what you will be buying.If you have one of the older Bach ones,better hang onto it."
3,cornet to trumpet mouthpiece convertor,"Good effort and OK, but needs dog tags to make it easy to remove. this gets stuck and is VERY hard to remove. I lost my old convertor,which had tags to give some grip for removal."
3,Fun for young kids,"The game itself is definitly a childs game, I thought it was a pretty decent game in the fact that it is a clean game. There was no cussing, abusive language, nudity, sensual/sexual enuindos. The gameplay was disappointing to say the least I was expecting a little better fighting abilities while you can buy extra cards to increase attack speed, strength, and 2 other abilities all said and done it's pretty darn cheap.Don't get me started on the graphics either they were pretty nasty. But if your looking for a system and game for a child then get this. Ages 4-8?"
3,Cannot use with other R/C,Great car. Son loved it... but cannot use with similar product from same company. Description says varying MHz but you have no say in what frequency you get. We ordered two and they both operate on same frequency so the boys cannot play together with their cars.
2,SMALL,"I probably should have read the product details more thoroughly, but I definitely was not expectingan 8"" car!!! It is tiny as can be. I haven't played with it yet, so cant speak on durability.I can say I can go to walmart and get a lot more toy for $20."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I was highly disappointed in this product. It was advertised as being 12"", but the box was only 10"" long! The car itself was 7.5"" long and the remote was as big as the car. The car was two-toned black and red and looked EXTREMELY cheap. I returned it before even opening it. On the other hand, it was only $17 so you get what you pay for. I just went to Toys R Us and got something 10X better and BIGGER... dont waste your money!"
1,Great model poor ride,"I love having a model car this size. I bought this one for family and friends to experience. Once I opened the box, batteries purchase is separate, the car remote control experience was very slow and even sluggish at times. After trying it for a few days to improve its performance, I gave up. It is what it is, a model toy, back in a box collecting dust."
3,Dont go with the image,I was very interest in this toy bcz of the color (red) but I got a faded blue which was not even good looking
2,Nice Appearance & Speed But Flimsy Steering,"'Ordered this car for a young male relative. It looks sharp in a compact, peppy package BUT...the wheel alignment knob came off & was lost within the first 2 hours of use and the car then would not go in a straight line, only in circles. I returned it to Amazon and ordered another one - and the SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. This time, the knob was found and I put it back on the car, but the car still won't go in a straight line, only hard left or hard right. This is a flimsy design. Don't waste your money on this car."
4,"Really fun, but not a REAL RC...","My kids love this car, but it is not super easy for them to drive. You need a good open space to actually drive with any kind of precision. The steering is non-proportional, meaning that it is straight, left and right. Not a little left or a little right, it is ALL left or ALL right. 2 of these would be great fun for drag racing or a wide easy oval track in the living room.That said, it is really fun to drive around and looks really cool. The battery life is so so - I have seen much worse from inxepensive RC cars."
4,A neat R/C car.,"This is a conventional R/C car, but the controls are unique. Instead of two sticks, you get an interface that mimics an actual car. I think a lot of kids would really enjoy that.The car itself is a good quality if you consider the lower price point.The car is quick and responsive to the controls, which are easy to use. It takes three AAs and 1 9V battery, and the AAs seem to last for several hours (the 9V much longer).Something about the wheels makes it easy to do slides in this car, which I found fun. I ran into walls a few times, and the car wasn't damaged at all by that.This is a good value for someone who is not necessarily looking for the top of the line R/C car, but rather just wants a fun toy that is properly made at a reasonable price."
2,remote cars,"got 2 for my grandsons, it said you could play with both at the same time cause they could be on different channels & not interfere with each other. NOT TRUE. you can only play with one at a time. If they both play only one was in control. Very disappointed. Nice cars. But don't buy 2 expecting to be able to play with both at same time."
4,Best inexpensive RC car I've owned,"Although my son is just 5 and a half, we've already been through several low-end RC vehicles of varying styles and quality. Without a doubt, this packs the most performance for the lowest price. The range is impressive. It's easy to drive and has enough power to spin out on the slick concrete in the garage. It looks great and I'm already considering buying one for myself to turn into a post-apocalyptic marauding vehicle. Best of all, I won't be out a lot of money when it's inevitably destroyed by my son and/or his little friends, probably later this week.Update: Unfortunately, someone found and started playing with the little front-wheel-alignment adjuster and broke it, so now the car's steering won't automatically center itself. The car still drives, but now it's mostly a left-right-left serpentine. So my advice is, get the alignment set and then glue that piece down, or put some duct tape over it."
4,Great little car. Love the mustang,"I have always liked Maisto stuff so when I saw this car I had to have it. It came well packed and is a really nice looking car. The controls are easy to use and my youngest couldnt wait to play with it. Anyway, it is a solid toy and appears to be able to take a bunch of hits. I will update this in a month when the car has been knocked around a bit. All in all a very nice item."
2,Bad imformation,Acording to the imformation on your web site the 2 cars could be used at the same time and as i bought them for my twin Grandsons they were most disapointed on Christmas day
3,"Nice looking car, not super durable","My son loved playing with this car on our hardwood floor. The steering seems quite accurate as he was quickly able to learn how to move the car around the table legs and the chairs. Many remote control cars don't have this easy of direction control. The car is awesome looking and the vintage mustang look is so cool. While my son is a typical 9 year old, he's not particularly hard on toys and after a week of play, the front axle of the car is cracked and the front wheel is now permanently crooked. I can only say that the car is not all that durable, although I recognize that no toy can handle extreme treatment by kids. I don't think this was the case with my son, however, so my conclusion is that the car is not built with very durable materials."
4,As Good as I Hoped,I bought this for a child on a giving tree who wanted a rc car. Color didn't vary from what I ordered and product was delivered right when I expected it.
2,Nice car...just don't buy 2 of them!,"I bought 2 of these cars for my kids to race based on what I believe is misleading advertising. Per the Product Description on Amazon, ""All models include the dashboard hand controller with multiple frequencies so two cars can be driven simultaneously.."" I assumed that you could actually change the frequency of each car so they could be played at the same time. Not so! I called the manufacturer who informed me that you have to buy one car at 49Mhz and the other one at a different frequency.As such, I'm left with 2 kids with 2 cars that both are controlled by the same controller...not much fun for playing racing!"
5,Cute little remote control Mustangs.,"My husband and I thought these were good gifts for our nephews. One of my husband's cars is a '67 Mustang, so it was fun to give these as Christmas gifts. The kids enjoyed them. I probably downgraded the durability a little bit because these are being played with by 2nd and 3rd graders and I thought there was some room for the kids to damage them easily. But they worked great and arrived from the vendor very timely."
4,"Works fine and is durable,",I got this for my six year old and it looks nice. It is the normal size for a remote control car such as I had in the 80's. It is nice and durable. It has a short radio range so the kid has to run if he wants to keep up with it at max speed. It is zippy and fast and steers a full 360 and has full front and back power. I am very happy with it.
5,Awesome,Great product came fast and it was exactly what i was looking for. I would definitely recommended it to friends and family.
5,The Most Affordable Classic Mustang Money Can Buy,"This s a pretty neat little car. Very stylish and color choice, the Black & Red colors just look very nice and clean.This little R/C is very quick and does handle pretty well. It has a dial on the front undercarriage so you can dial in the front wheel alignment.The car runs off three AA batteries and the remote uses one 9 volt battery. We userechargable batterieswhich has saved us tons of money using this toy.The signal range is excellent. The best feature of this little R/C it the Forward to Reverse driving stunting... most excellent. I wish I could get the same response out of a real car. I does donuts pretty well too. However, it is not powerful enough to do stationary 360 degree spin-outs.Highly recommended car. You get alot of power and coolness for the price."
4,Kat,Great details and color on the car. I love mustangs . I would be careful if buying this for a younger child because the frame could get broken if knocked into walls or dropped.
3,ummm no.,It was way smaller and looked different.I guess I thought it would look more like the picture.Kind of disappointed. I
4,It's okay,"Wasn't as nice as I had hoped but the child will love it, hope it will stand up to an 8 year olds torture, lol."
3,Great for Beginners,"As someone who is just learning about meditation, I found this book extremely interesting. I was unaware of all the types, forms, and ways to meditate. The book teaches how to ""prepare"" yourself for meditation with simpler exercises and gives many descriptive choices of ways to prepare yourself. Further into the book the author relays various ways to meditate, including how to use the Chakra's. The author comes off as open and honest. The book is to the point and anyone wanting to know about how to get started in meditation will truly benefit from this book."
1,Spirituality or just bad Chinese food?,"As in all of his works, Jones attempts sagacity and manages just ""gas""."
1,neil med=quackery,"After being prescribed this product by the doctor, I quickly picked it up asap. I used the product according to all directions(which are VERY VERBOSE, especially if you have a 103 fever). Immediately after use, which was uncomfortable to say the least, my maxillary sinuses did clear out. About a minute later however, the maxillary sinuses refilled along WITH the frontal sinuses(head). I have NEVER had my head sinuses or ear sinuses congested up to this point in my life. Thanks to neil med, I had to live through the horrible experience and am still trying to clear them.Do yourself a favor, save yourself the 12 dollars for this product and stick to Pedialyte and soup. Soup did a whole lot more for clearing sinuses than this quackery."
2,Very INEFFECTIVE in acute or subacute sinusitis conditions,"I do not want to disappoint hopefuls as this product may still work for the maintenance purpose such as keeping your nostrils cleaned from every-day dust accumulation (and for that reason I give it two start instead of one). However do not hold your breath expecting any relief from your condition if it is acute or subacute. It is NOT going to happen - I guarantee it! The product may be o'k for the traveling as it is compact and ready-to-use, but again, do not waste your time and money if you need an immediate help. I cannot and would not take the responsibility of giving you an advise as I am not a medical professional. Though I did try different things which work much much better than this NeilMed Sinus Rinse."
4,Paperback Re-Issue,"Thought that this might be a second edition of this book (there is a second edition of Appel's Java book).However, this is a ""Paperback Re-Issue"" of the original 1997 edition."
4,Informative.,"The author of this book addressed all the issues that I needed to resolve. It is not a ""spoon feed"" approach, however there is enough examples to explain the authors ideas.I won't recommend the book for people who likes a ""copy-paste"" approach."
2,a good theory...,"Not so bad, not so good... it has good topics, but there are not implementation of how to build it, the small number of sample have some unique (rare) style... if you intent to write your first compiler this is NOT your book, if you already made one and pass for some frustating issues then this is your book..."
4,Wall Mounted Hair Dryer,"Does everything it advertised. The highest heat setting is not real hot compared to other hair dryers, but this may be a good feature. I am happy with the product and would recommend it if asked."
4,Hair Dryer,Am familiar with Oster products and very pleased in general with their performance. For the price this model is very good and I look forward to years of service. The convenience of wall mounting is great and it looks good asthetically next to medicine cabinet.
2,on off button jams,Bought this product thinking it was a good product. After using this product about 5 times the on off button jams. the on button doesn't hold you have to hold the on button with one hand while drying your hair. Design was poorly thought out as the on off button should have been on the handle. It makes no sense to hold the dryer then having to push the on button on the wall mount then to turn off you then put the dryer back into the case to turn it off. It seems like more work then just to have the controls on the dryer itself. I bought this to save space but it ended up being a poorly designed dryer.
4,Nice Product,"This is the second one we have ordered, product works great, easy install and very powerful, last one was left on and clipped into the holder, it melted the holder enought so it would not stay in. Have had the first one about 4 years with no problems, use almost every day and still works well. Keeps the bathroom counter and cabinet free."
3,Worked great for 3 years then burned out. Going to order a new one I guess for $30 in is worth it.,Worked for 3 years than burned out. Decided to order another one since I have the wall plate already on the wall. I guess for $10 a year it was worth it. Although I hate to throw it in to the dump.
5,Very useful hair dryer,We now have three of these and they are hard to find. This is the model that has plenty of power and a high speed with less or more heat.Most other models have a wimpy high speed with no choice of less heat. Very useful when you just want to finish drying off but don't want to cook.Nice and easy to mount. Good Product!!
1,dissapointed,"Within 2 months, the hair dryer constantly overheats and turns itself off within 1-2 minutes. I have short hair and it turns off 2-3 times per use. I have to blow into the fan mechanism to cool it down before it will restart."
4,Why did I wait so long?,"We've all used the wall-mounted blow dryers in hotels, and then gone home to the unit sitting on the counter-top in our bathroom. I finally broke down and purchased this wall-mounted unit and put it in my wife's bathroom. It only took a couple of minutes to install the mounting plate with the supplied hardware. What a difference. No more cords dangling in the sink and knocking items on the floor. I chose this model because it has a removable filter to allow easier cleaning. My feelings about blow dryers is that they're pretty much all the same within price ranges. I don't expect a $35 item to last 10 years. . . I will happily replace it when it wears out. This one works fine and I don't have any complaints. I'd buy it again tomorrow if faced with the same need and happily recommend it to anyone who's considering a purchase."
4,Prefer older model but works as advertised.,Bought this unit to replace a Sunbeam 1500 watt model that had a broken fan blade (was dropped on a tile floor). I miss the three temperature settings available on the older model. This one only has two. Otherwise it is a good product.
4,Poor Design,"Hair Dryer works nicely, But, the mounting plate leaves a lot to be desired. Dryer fits loosly in the mounting plate. I had to drill an extra hole to mount the plate and dryer tightly to the wall. The plate could of used better engineering. Overall, the unit works great. There is not a lot to choose from when it comes to wall mount hair dryers."
1,Burned up in 8 months,"I've always thought that Oster produced great products but not this time. I purchased this hair dryer in November 2007. This morning, without warning, it started smoking and glowing bright red inside. I was able to pull the plug (the GFI never tripped). I won't be buying another one of these hair dryers."
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed that the hair dryer does not have a ""cool air"" setting. Need to have just cool air for some drying needs.Ferol Rudd"
4,Convenient wall-mounted dryer until it failed catastrophically,"This model was installed by our contractor and served well for several years, until one day its innards flew apart (nobody was hurt) -- so we bought a replacement. The wall mount is very convenient. Because we installed it low on a cabinet and the cord is a bit short, we hung it ""upside-down"" (i.e. cord on top), which requires the fifth (optional) screw through the hole in the magnet (otherwise it would slip right off the wall mount). Power is adequate for me."
3,Wall Mount Hair Dryer,"I had 2 of the previous model of this Oster hair dryer in my home for the past 10 years and they both died within one week of another... Now that's planned obsolesence. This new model is a bit larger and more stylish; but, it seems to be a litte weaker in the power department."
3,Hair dryer,"It looks great on the wall, but just isn't very powerful. Takes much longer to dry my hair, wish I had known."
2,HAIR DRYER REVIEW,The hair dryer cuts off within a couple minutes. I dry my hair with another hair dryer. This one won't even stay on long enough for me to style my hair. I had one just like it for a couple years previously. It worked much better.
3,It works OK,"This hair dryer works OK but it only has two speeds ""Lo"" and ""Hi"" and even the ""Hi"" setting doesn't give much airflow and the amount of heat like the portable ones you can can get at cheaper prices. Also, the dryer doesn't turn on automatically as some of the dryers I use in the hotels. You have to push a button to turn it on. Not sure if the dryers in the hotel are made exclusive like that. The base is a little poorly designed because it doesn't flush with the wall so it may come out easily if you use a plastic anchor to mount it instead of mounting directly into a stud."
2,Disappointing,"Bought this hairdryer to replace the same one that had been hanging on the wall for 10 years and finally died. Was excited when the bracket was the same so didn't have to do anything but hang it up..Then I used it. It doesn't get hot. Blows nice warm air but doesn't get hot enough to style your hair. I now have this one hanging on the wall, unplugged, while I use one that I haul out of the drawer every morning."
1,Kicks off within seconds,"Perhaps I have a bad thermistor in my unit because it kicks off within moments of turning it on. I have short hair, so I'm not trying to dry a mane. So, I bought a regular hair dryer instead. Usually Oster is a great product, but not my unit."
2,Fan Blades Fell Off,"My wife has used this dryer for eleven months without complaint, UNTIL NOW! This morning, all six internal blower blades literally just suddenly fell apart. What is otherwise a great product is ruined by the poorly made fan blades. It's obvious that the blade material is cheap and simply can't hold up. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,Lasts Less than a Year,Great hair dryer but doesn't work very long. Overheats and quits. This is the 2nd one in less than 2 years. Would not buy again.
1,Does not blow hot air.,"I received this item yesterday, tried it for the first time this morning. It had sufficient power, but the air was warm at best, even on the high setting. I could put my hand about an inch in front of the blower and leave it without getting burned. Was really disappointed in this product. I am returning it and will try another brand."
3,Good,"Having an oster wall mounted hairdryer in excess of 10 years , that had 3 speeds , it is a little difficult getting accustomed to a two speed model. ( this is what the newer ones are ) If this one lasts as long as the first one I will be very happy"
3,Disposable Hair Dryer,"This is a decent little hair dryer. Mine only lasted 18 months with daily use, then died completely. I have very thin hair and on most days only dry my bangs for a total of about 3 minutes drying time. The on/off button does jam and needs to be pressed very hard. The cord is a good length but tangles easily. My daughter has thick long hair and this dryer doesn't work for her. Like most hair dryers if you get your hair too close to the fan it sucks it in. My only real complaint is that it died so quickly. If you are looking for a very basic dryer that can hang on the wall and you don't mind replacing it every year or 2, this one is sufficient. I am going to try a different brand and see if I can find one that lasts longer than a year and a 1/2."
4,"So far, so good!","Purchased in July of 2011, still reliable and doing the job. This is the second wall hair dryer I purchased, the first one (not a well-known brand) died on me after a short time, but I believe Oster is a quality brand. Very convenient and actually fun to use. If you have long hair, and need to use a dryer for more than 3 - 4 minutes, it probably won't stand up to that kind of use."
4,Oster Professional Wall Mount Hair Dryer,I enjoy the compact size and the wall-mount comes in handy when you don't have a lot of counter space for hair dryers.
4,Dark dragon tale not without humor,"After reading the plot summary, I wasn't actually all that interested, but because it was Briggs, I read it anyway and this series has turned out to be a keeper for me. Briggs doesn't disappoint with another original plot containing mystery, magic, and a lot of character development.At times very serious (dealing with issues of abuse, betrayal, torture, and madness) - yet without going into a total downward spiral - we follow the hero, Ward, as he grows from a young man oppressed (he speaks slowly and lost most of his magic after a particularly bad beating from his father) but not defeated, who fights to reclaim his life and his family's honor. Over the course of the series, the mystery of Ward's family and the dragon is revealed and does not disappoint.This was not the usual type of dragon story that I usually go for. A rather dark story that could have easily gone south, it was tempered with Ward's unfailing steadfastness, humor, and all around good guy appeal."
4,Interesting Dragon Bones,"This book was interesting, I enjoyed reading it.I liked best how Ward of Hurog(the main character) could be passably stupid but wise as well. He has played the fool for most of his life but when his abusive father, the Lord of Hurog, and his reason to feign simpleness, dies Ward becomes the Lord of Hurog. That is until a nobleman declares him too dim witted to rule, thus Ward rides off to the War brewing on the border, to prove that he IS the rightful Lord of Hurog. Through most of which he is accompanied by an odd servant named Oreg, who really isnt what he seems, Tolsen, Wards runaway brother,and Ciarra, his little sister who led him to a great discovery... the Dragon Bones.I think I'll add one more enticing bit of information.""Hurog means dragon."""
4,Another Great Book by Patricia Briggs!,I found this novel to be very entertaining and well written. Her character development is tremendous and I found myself right there along side Ward and his comrades. I did not want to put the book down and was saddened when it ended. I look forward to another story about Hurog!
3,Good Ideas but Incomplete,"This is the second of Ms. Briggs books that I have read and both suffer from the same flaw. Her ideas are interesting and absorbing. Her characters are people you can really get to care about. Her twists are twisty but... her books are to short.I don't mean that it a good way. I don't mean that I was disappointed when it was over and I wanted to pick it up again and read it a second time. What I mean is that she spends 4/5th of the book on build up and plot and more build up, only to wrap things up to quickly and neatly in the very last bit. I don't think I have ever said this about an author before but her books need to be longer.If you are looking for a quick summer read with iteresting ideas and characters and a light ending then this might be the book for you. Interestingly I think I will at least LOOK at her other books as they come out. I think there is tremendous potential there, it just (as far as I am concerned) hasn't been reached yet.J"
5,Was very fun to read. Couldn't put it down.,"At first I was thinking that it was lacking something, i wasn't buying the idiot theme. But it really started to pick up and i was having so much fun reading it i ran out and got the second before i was finished with the 1st. Both great books."
3,"have to agree, good book, but incomplete","I bought this book based upon mostly good reviews, but I had a difficult time keeping my focus on this book. Although I liked a lot of the characters: Ward, Oreg, etc., ultimately, the storyline wasn't enough to keep my interest."
1,Ugly,"I was introduced to Briggs by reading the Raven Duology. Once I find an author I enjoy, I usually get and read his or her other works. So once I finished that series, I went decided to try some of Briggs' earlier works. Boy, was that a big mistake! This book and the next one are utterly terrible. Poor writing, poor characters, and just nothing to offer really. The good news is, Briggs writing really turns the corner in her later works. Just steer clear of these and you'll be happy."
5,I'd give it 10 stars if I could,"I have to admit that I'm a fantasy aficionado--which means that I love 'em all. However, this book is my absolute favorite of any book in my library. I read it as a treat any time I'm needing to regroup and never miss re-reading a word. I think I've read this duology a dozen times at least and I'm positive that I'll read them 5 times that with joy.As others have stated, these books have it all. But for me, the best part of these books is the world that was created--that I keep wanting to return to as soon as I read the last word.Thank you, Patricia, for creating this world for us; and for writing two books that never fail to make me smile. I love all of Ms. Briggs books and buy them for her name alone--knowing that she is a phenomenal author and will always succeed in telling her stories with humor and compassion."
5,A new favorite,I absolutely loved this series! The characters are sooo good and the story so intense! I couldn't put either of the books in theie series down and finished both in books in a little over 3 days. I know I will be reading these books again and again.
1,Oregon Pioneers by Maria L. Hidden,"I'll try any book for a buck, but this one should be avoided. It's a photocopied children's book that is 17 pages long (including the title page and publisher info). It's a poem with illustrations. I read it in two minutes! Don't get me wrong, it's a nice poem, but I was looking more for memoirs or a story."
1,NO GOOD W/ WIN 7??? READ RECENT NEG REVIEWS,"The good reviews for this seem to pre-date windows 7 mostly (thus they review an EARLIER version???). Claims it will work w/ Windows 7 but crashes on ours (we EXCEED stated minimum requirements). Also, the disk MUST be in the computer to TRY to play this--- can't just download onto computer as you would probably want to do for a young child. Thus I continue the search for GOOD windows 7 ""EC""- rated childrens learning software. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
1,Old and not useable,"I ordered this to work with my son on preschool activities. It's so old, I can't even get it to work properly on my new laptop. I wouldn't recommend buying this at all."
2,Complicated compared to others,"Compared to other Preschool pc games, I felt this one was a bit complicated to get to the activities, specially for younger kids."
1,HATED IT!,This darn thing froze my computer. I can't get the disk to work ad I can't get it to uninstall from my computer. Maybe I just got a bad disk but from the 1 activity it lets the kids do it is not worth your time or money
5,Mikey's Preschool Computer Game,"My son loves playing this game, it has a lot of different things to do with numbers and letters. It is very interesting, the best part to him is when he gets to honk the horn at Uncle Donald and watch him drop his towels and duck when he gets scared. It is very good, we need some more Mikey Mouse!"
2,Buyer Beware,The software is old and computer security does not like it. My computer guy says it is not safe for most computers anymore. We are running it on a computer that is used for gaming only and I'm not sure how long we will be willing to take the risk
4,scott nash is the best!,"Scott Nash is one talented illustrator. As with all of his books, the wit within his style and the attention to detail bring the words alive."
5,history of del norte,"I think this is a great book for people of all ages to learn about Del Norte County . It would be great for book reports , essays ,or just for fun."
3,Stories from Japan,Good stories for children in late second grade or early third grade. The old edition is better because the paperback editions come apart after a few readings.
5,Price Matters,"The lead reviewer suggests that many readers arrive at this site by accident. True no doubt, and unfortunate in the extreme. What's more, this unfortunate state of affairs will persist until someone brings out an inexpensive edition of this fine young adult book and its predecessor, ""The Ark."" When I went looking for Kate Seredy's beautiful books, I was happy to find low cost editions readily available. Good reviews are important. But until teachers can assign affordable editions of these titles and young adults can buy inexpensive copies for independent reading, these very special books will languish in comparative obscurity. They deserve better, and so do our young readers."
4,Innovation viewed through a social lens,"A short book, written from the perspective of a research interested in the links between ""Technology"" and ""Society"". To me the book was worth reading if only for its focus on two insights.a) Innovation is about social change. A new product, a new technology, that does not provoke changes of behaviour will end up just being a foot note in some academic record. Socially irrelevant.b) Radical innovations tend to appear in the intersection between disciplines. Specialized organizations produce incremental innovations. Radical innovations require a more open environment. The history of the development of Internet, covered in the book, is a good example.A quick read, non academical."
1,Disagree with the moral in this story...,"I seriously question the moral of this story, which seems to be that people should be content with their station in life, and not aspire to anything better. Really? It's never specifically mentioned what is so terrible about being a bird. Freedom and abundance on a tropical isle is supposed to be a bad thing in the story, and Al should rather find contentment by struggling to make ends meet as a low paid and under-appreciated janitor in the inner city. As far as children's books go, I would rather encourage my children to dream and strive, not settle for discontentment and a low paying job. We won't be re-reading this one."
3,Not one to read over and over,"This book had a very imaginative and fun beginning and middle. But then it just abruptly ended and was over. My 5 year old boy likes long chapter books, and then he likes short books like this to be read over and over again. He hasn't wanted to read this one again."
2,Not the Original Binding,"While I love this book and am a huge fan of Arthur Yorinks and Richard Egielski, this is not the original hardcover printing. It seems to be a book club binding. The cover art is printed directly on the board in rather unattractive colors; there is no jacket or end papers. The paperback actually looks better."
5,great condition,Book arrived as described. Book also arrived within the shipment date. Will be in my collection for along time. Hey Al will be used for a college class. Can't wait to see what the teacher has in mind.
4,Initial eval,pump replaced a bad swimming pool pump. installed easily and works well. time will tell the rest of the tale.
5,EXACT REPLACEMENT,EXACT REPLACEMENT OF THE PUMP THAT FAILED. THE NEW ONE HAS BEEN WORKING GREAT FOR THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF.
2,Horrible ribbons!,"And to think they are originally from the manufacturer of the product, the Dymo brand.These ribbons are so bad, it is sheer luck if they work correctly. Should they work, they pull the ink ribbon along when they print, they have no middle-cut peel outs for ease of use, and they usually don't work. Something happens that the printing roll is badly coiled and when you insert it, it won't advance.One of the ribbons I actually had to break in order to make it work and about 30% of the printing roll was wasted, because the ink ribbon ran out due to the modification I had to make to see it work.I don't recommend you buy these, not to mention the fact that they are so expensive. Buy a generic brand instead. It will be cheaper and do honor to its price."
1,Horrible - Received only 2 of 10 ordered - No response,"Horrible experience, after receiving only 2 of the 10 items I have no recourse and have not heard anything from the vendor."
2,Not good.,"If the authors were less enthusiastic about mathematics for its own sake, they probably would have written a better book. This one is said to be suitable for undergraduates, but I don't think so. I have a master's degree in electrical engineering, and several of the mathematical concepts they mention were just vaguely familiar names to me. That would be OK if I were persuaded that those concepts were essential to an understanding of wavelets, but I'm not. The book seems somewhat ill organized as well; new terminology should be defined before it's used, not fifty pages later."
3,Useful,"As a fench student in English, I have to say that this book has a lot of interesting information and is very useful. Plus, it is very-well organized"
2,Inaccurate Product Image,"I was ordering this for parts to repair an existing filter. The product image showed it to be the old model, which is what I have here, but when I received it, it was the newer version and the parts are not interchangeable. I couldn't use it, and returning it was pointless considering the shipping costs. I was disappointed to say the least."
2,Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion in American History (In American History),"Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion in American History (In American History)is a great book if all you want is an overview of the subject matter. The author has made use of a range of sources such as newspaper excerpts and legislation bills throughout, yet this book offers the reader a narrative rather than an interpretive history. I would recommend this book for high school children, or those who are interested in learning the basic facts about Nat Turner and the events that surrounded the insurrection. From a scholarly perspective, this publication is limited in its usefulness. On the upside, Edwards' book does contain some beautiful etchings, paintings and photographs that do not appear in many other books about Nat Turner."
2,Talent teasings,2 1/2Filler-centric avant-prog doesn't have the content to capture like past releases but as engaging background can work well.
2,"uh, old now, don't buy this for this price",i can't believe someone is trying to sell this card for 400 dollars. i bought mine 6 months ago for half of that. i was just searching amazon for a reasonable 'used' price when i saw this. i'll sell you mine for a c note
1,Don't believe the hype and please no sequel!,"I watched this based on the two 5 Star reviews. I have decided to give this one star to hopefully dissuade anyone else from believing this is a movie deserving of 5 stars.Aside from the shallow Christian proselytizing that interfered with a potentially promising plot the downside is slow pacing, hackneyed dialogue and PAINFULLY transparent exposition.None of the characters were likeable and the only thing the film possibly had going for it was a good twist at the end that was however POORLY executed.This movie is great for those who cannot think for themselves but rather choose to see the world in a good versus evil prism where ambition is evil and sacrifice is good. In short if you like Ayn Rand you will hate this movie. If you love late night evangelical programming then by all means go for it!"
5,One of those cds where I like EVERY song!,I love this cd and listened to it over and over until I lent it to my father-in-law . . . who kept it! I bought myself a new copy because I didn't want to deprive him of the cd by asking for it back. It's great.
4,Great But Difficult,"Bad news up front: the style of writing is very difficult to read. It reminds me of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" in that the sentence structure forces you to go very slowly. I don;'t know if that is a result of this particular translation or if it is a fair rendition of Eusebius' writing style. If it wasn't for this, I would have rated this 5 stars.That said, what makes this book so gripping is the content itself. I was blown away by how much the early Christians had to sacrifice for being a Christian. It has made me realize what a bunch of wimps we American believers are. This was an extremely eye-opening book and well worth your time to read."
3,No Active Table of Contents,"I downloaded a sample of this book to see how it is formatted before I buy the whole thing and discovered that it has no active table of contents. Actually, no table of contents at all. I guess that's okay if you want to read cover to cover, but I also want to reference it for teaching a church history class."
5,The world needs more of his music!,Ernesto Cortazar prodives me with such beautiful music at home. Why aren't his songs available on CD so we can listen to his music away from the computer?
4,Adidas shoes - Sound quality GREAT PRICE,"solid quality, and the price was 5 stars. Never found a deal for tennis shoes this good before!"
1,Poor excuse for writing,I did not like the book at all. As far as Im concerned it is just a bunch of run on thoughts that have nothing to back up what she was thinking.
5,Heart-Pounding!!,"This is without a doubt, one of the best books I have read. I didn't want to put the book down. I was lost in the world that Ariel Hernandez created. I was attached to this book until the very last page. I recommend this book to anyone who loves to be intrigued by endless twists of fate and suspense!"
4,Helps keep my sinuses clear,"I have chronic sinus issues. This product helps keep my sinuses clear and helps remove excess mucus, better than the isotonic solution. Just dump a packet into a neti pot or squeeze bottle, add some distilled water and squirt away."
5,Excellent book,"This book has provided me much comfort this year while going through some growing pains. It helps us women remember that it's ok not to be th perfect ""wonder women"" that we pressure ourselves to be. I purchased this for myself and then promptly purchased it for my best friend. I have read several ""self-help"" books lately, and this has had the greatest lasting impact on my perspective. I HIGHLY recommend it."
5,Wish I'd known this stuff earlier,I found this book to be helpful in deciding what is important in every day life. I gave it to my daughter so she wouldn't have to learn everything like I did--the hard way!
5,"Funny & Helpful Book, Whether You're A Perfectionist or Not!","This is a funny and timely book for our busy lives today. I was never a perfectionist, so I wasn't sure I would get anything out of it. But this book was so much more than a cure for perfectionism. (I think most of us gave up on that a long time ago anyway!) It was about bettering your life in many ways: being a better friend, enjoying your work and kids more, better understanding your spouse, and just getting more fun out of life. You see how perfectionism is overrated and how it keeps people from being really happy. This book showed some realistic ways to enjoy your life as you're living it instead of waiting for it to be perfect. I loved all the examples. Some of them were hysterial, and the quizzes made me laugh out loud."
5,Hits the mark and made me laugh,"I absolutely loved this book and I recommend it to all women. It's funny and it really gave me a new perspective. Instead of just telling me what to do, it helped me figure it out for myself. The author said in the intro that one of her goals was for the reader to get a ten year jump in perspective and that really did happen for me. I really loved the quizzes. Glad to know I'm not the only one that isn't an ""Earth Mother, Commander of the Universe, or Princess of the Palace."""
4,A variety of easy listening jazz,"The idea of this CD was to bring together some of my musical friends, give them their choice of tunes and record them with the right people behind them, hence the two different trios and two different quartets. I felt it came off quite well."
3,"Not suitable for experienced, but great for the beginner.","This book covers everything you need to know to make a very basic, collarless jacket. Topics discussed include silhouettes, accurate measuring, fabric and interfacing choices, fitting, seam finishes, and step-by-step instuctions on assembling the jacket. However, the book does not cover welt and bound pockets (only patch pockets are included), bound buttonholes, collars and lapels- especially the notched collar. Tailoring and shaping are also excluded. (For a good overview of all of these techniques and some other goodies, check out Claire Shaeffer's ""Couture Sewing Techniques; Taunton Press, 1993) The book is perfectly suited for those who may be wary of undertaking a jacket. The instructions are clear and there are many photographs. There is even a section that breaks down the sewing steps for a weekend jacket project, which is encouraging."
1,Is Ed Wood responsible?,"I watched this movie today for the first time and I found itunintentionally hilarious. I can't imagine what Stockwell andRoberts were thinking when they jumped into this project. The film has the misfortune of being released in the same era as the intentionally hilarious ""Men in Black,"" which steals (and mocks) the thunder from the serious premise of the movie.One scene in particular had me howling. Six or seven hybrid human/alien MiBs charge a house, and it looks like ""Revenge of the Blues Brothers,"" or something.I gotta say, I found it riveting for all the wrong reasons.The acting was horrible, as the actors must have known whata dog they were in as filming progressed.Speaking of dogs, Anthrax the Border Collie did a great job."
1,Oh my Gawd!,"I have seen a couple of movies worse than this one, but only a couple, including Robinson Crusoe On Mars.Horrific acting, stupid plot, bratty child actor. Cheesy special effects, some of the most hilariously lame fight scenes I have ever seen in my life. It makes spaghetti westerns and amateur porn films look like high art. Dean Stockwell should be ashamed. Guess he needed money.Rent it first, before even spending $8.99 on it. It might be worth having if you find rubber masked aliens dressed up like the Blues Brothers humorous, and want to listen to a bratty kid continually call his father an idiot, but otherwise, it's a good one to miss."
5,Here We Go Again.,"Here we go again with another stick of Hong Kong dynamite. Undercover cop, Coke (Lau Ching Wan) and Triad Leader, Chiu (Francis Ng) are killed by good cop, Huang (Anthony Wong) in a bust gone bad. Years later, the sons of the dead men want revenge against Huang, who has become one of the best detectives on the force. Coke's son, 7-Up (Raymond Wong) is making a great name for himself as a smart young cop. Chiu's son, Wai (Jordan Chan) has surpassed his father and is the new king of the underworld. 7-Up eventually becomes a colleague of Huang and is torn between right and wrong. Wai, on the other hand, still wants Huang dead. Wong Jing and Marco Mak do a great job directing the all-star cast which also features Gillian Chung and the legendary Patrick Tse. If you are a HK action junkie like I am, you will definitely enjoy Colour Of The Truth."
4,Clashing Views very informative,"The essays are not all logical, but they do present the arguments that people are using right now. Our class used this book to prepare us teachers to respond thoughtfully when people lambast public education, instead of responding emotionally. All teachers should take the time to become ambassadors for education."
1,Ehh,"I couldn't figure it out. I tried about 7 times, looking for a result, even a small one. Never felt even the slightest bit of pleasure. Was very dissapointed."
4,Clear silly putty,"It's like a clear version of silly putty. It stretches if you pull it slow. If you pull fast, it rips. Bounces really well. Pretty cool stuff."
5,Great Watch,"I purchased this watch for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! His first words were ""its fancy enough for work but casual enough for weekend wear."" This watch is very versital and looks very expensive. It does have some weight to it but not alot for a man. This watch is plenty big enough as well (my boyfriend had to take some links off).Great watch overall, it comes highly reccomended."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this watch from Amazon for a Christmas gift, needless to say it arrived with scratches on it as if it were worn for years. I would be very careful in buying jewelry from Amazon in the future. I could not believe it when I opened the box and you have to wait almost 14 days to get a refund... even more disappointing..."
3,scratches,"THIS ITEM IS AMAZING, MY BOYFRIEND LOVE IT, BUT IT CAME WITH MANY SCRATCHES ON THE BRACELET."
4,No Diamond .... But Good Watch,"Well, this watch is titled ""Bulova Men's Diamond Accented Watch"" but it does not have a diamond on it. At least mine did not. The picture is accurate but confusing as there is no diamond. It is a very nice watch and a great price for it at that! It came quickly and was in good condition! I gave it as a gift and the person who received it loves it! Just a confusing title if you ask me."
5,Excellent Watch,"Excellent Dress Watch, good built quality, have been using is for over six months. This is as of Dec 2012"
2,Very Disappointed With Purchase,"When I received the watch it had several scratches on the band. In addition, the watch looked very cheap...not at all the way it appeared in pictures. Overall I was very disappointed with the watch and I returned it for a refund."
4,Great Recording from a Killer Big Band,"As a Cincinnati native, I grew up listening to the Blue Wisp Big Band in both their old club, and the new club downtown. If you're in Cincinnati on a Wednesday night, be sure to catch the big band live!This recording is a welcome addition to my collection. John Von Ohlen is simply a master--a monster of drummer. If there was ever a guy who embodied ""hep"" and could cut a groove deep enough to swim in, he's the man. How can you not enjoy a man who once buried a ride cymbal in his back yard for a year to tame its tone?This CD lacks some of my favorite up-tempo tunes like Straight Track, but even if you only listen to Rockin' and Rhythm (track 9), this disc is well worth your time and money!"
5,"Forget the ""tips."" Read this book.","This is a great book to have if you have the basics down and want to improve your game. In my case, I was being stymied by a lot of ""tips"" that I had collected. Based on the suggestions in the book, I began becoming more aware of balance and timing -- and trusting my awareness more than all those tips. The book uses the great imagery of a pendulum for improving your swing.The book could have more on the serve, which is a strange and unnatural stroke. But I am happy with what I was able to get from this book."
2,This book might possibly help a struggling beginner,"Most amateur atheletes who are looking for a breakthrough are stuck at an intermediate plateau and want to get to an advanced level. This book won't help someone like that. The book might possibly help a frustrated beginner become less frustrated. The book would be best appreciated perhaps by seniors and by people who don't play for points but just to get some exercise knocking the ball around. Some of the advice in this book would be harmful to a beginner who is serious and wants to progress to a strong game. I was disappointed in the book, I found it repetitive and simple minded and just plain wrong in places."
1,Piece of garbage from Spyder,"This turned out to be garbage. The zipper came undone upon moderate packing, and the clip that holds one of the boots in place broke on the first use. Returned to Amazon."
2,No good in frigid climate! ! !,"I bought two of these frames for my daughters new car, and they really looked great. The problem is, we live in Minneapolis and the chrome plating on these frames is not the highest quality. After one winter,the frames were coroded badly and we had to replace them. My advice to anyone considering license plate frames is to go with stainless steel, expecially if you live in a frigid climate. One other problem we had is that she got a ticket for having a ""cover"" over the license plate. Minnesota has a law that does not allow you to cover the license plate, even with clear glass or plastic so, I would recomend that you check with your local police and make sure it's legal to use these frames in your jurisdiction."
4,So far so good,"This product looks nice, has a satisfying weight to the metal frame, and works like it's supposed to. The only question I had was whether or not it aged well. (i.e., does it pit, corrode and fog over?) Well, I haven't owned it through a winter yet, but it still looks very good, which is better than the last plate guard I bought. If that changes, I will update this review."
3,SAP Consultants Review,"Starts out good, then goes into a very narrow explanation of SAP's configuration capability. Does not use graphics to show screens very well especially on the more complex SAP tuning required. Lots of referrals to IMG. Makes a fair attempt at explaning a complex subject....beaware that much more is needed to accomplish an SAP implementation."
2,Not a primary reference book,"This is an OK reference book -- after you've read the SAP PM book and on-line help. It is not a primary reference. The black/white screen shots are sparse; the ones provided are blurry, and its difficult to make out the screen details that are included. With the subject heading layouts it is difficult to follow where in the IMG the configuration topics are located. There is little 'best practice' for implementing PM; it is rather an explanation of the configuration setting items."
4,Good reference,This is a good reference for all into SAP Plant Maintenance. I believe it is one of the better books around on its topic.
3,black seed soap,"I love this soap, however i paid $12 for one bar. It is very expansive and didn't think I will buy from here again."
4,Excellent,Re-make of old Suny Ade songs. Brought back memories of days back in Nigeria. A great addition to anyone's collection.
5,"Too much ""lkhall"" here!","Someone's had too much to drink?! This album goes through the roof! We need to boost these ratings. I mean, just listening to the samples demonstrates this cat's skill and feel for music. I'll give the prior commentator this: You have to have ""Juju Music"" to really understand King Sunny Ade. But ""lkhall"" is way out of tune."
1,"Get real, this is not a five. This is star inflation.","If you want a CD by King Sunne Ade, buy Juju Music. If you have it, buy another artist. I see I will have to put up a list of what is really a five."
4,...,"Like I've said before, I don't like compilations or greatest hits record but this is actually a good retrospective of The Roots. It has some great remixes, live stuff, and quality songs from past albums. We all know that they are talented musicians and can write a great pop song or a great political thriller and this showcases all of that. The live version of The Seed/The Web is pretty much a masterpiece that needs to be heard by everything. Blackthought and ?uestlove really let loose and it makes for a fun get down."
2,Don't Buy This Album....,"sorry....i don't recommend you buy this album.i love the vol.1 of their greatest hits, but vol.2 is quiet disappointing. sure, vol.2 have some good songs too but it simply can't be compared to vol.1 I hate to say this buti nearly fell asleep while listening to this album. if you don't have any of the roots album and want to get to know their music, just buy vol.1 and 'Things Fall Apart.'"
4,Don't stop,"OK, not as exciting as Winter King, perhaps because I was so thrilled with it. This book is necessary to really feel what the characters are feeling, and that is what this second book in the series brings. I still could not put it down, but the excitement was slightly less that Winter King, like the middle child, but I was rewarded for my time with Excalibur. You cannot miss this step in the story, and still by far this is the best historical fiction series I have ever read."
4,ANOTHER WINNER,"In keeping with the majority of the authors work history is brought to life. The author has a flair for making history interactive and interesting with believable characters and vivid action. I will read the complete works and if we could get history books to read like this, boys would pay attention in class!"
4,Great Historical Fiction,"Excellent book, as Cornwells generally are. Very historically enlightening as to both the period of time and the people who lived during that period, eg, Arthur, Merlin, etc. And as always, exciting enough to make one forget that he or she is learning as they read."
5,Phenomenal Sequel,"With ""The Winter King"" Cornwell introduced us to his vision of the Arthurian legend. In this followup we get an expansion that gives us a look at the traditional quest narrative, a staple of the Arthurian tradition, as well as his take on Lancelot and Arthur's division over Guinevere. All of this is layered over a thematic examination of the importance of religion in the scheme of politics. Cornwell takes a firm stand and makes some interesting points that are quite relevant in the current political climate. Admittedly the book seems to start off a bit slowly but the narrative picks up speed effectively and reaches an unbelievably satisfying climax. I tore through the final 100 or so pages in a final sitting because I was so hooked.To make a long story short, this is one of the best sequels I have ever read."
5,Bernard Cornwell Excellent Writer,"I do so l like Bernard Cornwell's works. This series about ""King"" Arthur takes us back to 500 A.D. or so. Extremely well written, though a map would have been helpful."
3,"A good novel, but not of Arthur!","I love the Arthur theme, therefore, I read everything that is written about the Arthurian Legends. I read the Winter King and enjoyed it, and was looking forward to the sequel. They both say ""A Novel of Arthur"". Don't you think it should read ""A Novel of Derfel"" with Arthur as a secondary character? Derfel is a superman, by whose side even Arthur pales. A novel of Arthur should be about Arthur."
1,Not Good. (NEW),I was not happy with the condition of the book. It was suppose to be new but I dont think so. The cover was dog eared and so were some of the pages. The book was not in very good shape for a NEW BOOK. I purchased two other books at the same time and they were perfect.
5,Excellent twist on Arthurian legend,"Second in the Warlord Chronicles, his Arthurian trilogy, told from the viewpoint of Derfel Cadarn, a Saxon slave boy who has now become one of Arthur's greatest warriors. A heady blend of historical fiction and fantasy with the retelling of the Arthurian legend in a very plausible way, without a whole lot of romantic nonsense--there are love stories within the story, but it's primarily a tale of war, greed, and hunger for power, which makes it (in my opinion) a much more likely scenario than the fairy tale type Arthur stories.I particularly enjoyed Cornwell's treatment of Arthur's ""Round Table."" LOL It's impossible to begin to talk about this book very much without giving away too much. I can only advise anyone who enjoys Arthurian legends to check this series out--it truly is excellent and has a place firmly on my Keeper shelf."
4,A Good Read,"The Enemy of God is a worthy sequel to the Winter King, a must read for anybody interested in dark ages Britain or the Arthurian legends. I'm currently reasearching a P.h.D. in dark ages Britain, and I can tell you that is historical accuracy is spot on."
5,Enemy of God,"Bernard Cornwell, is the best of the best author of historical novels. This book is no exception. Good stuff! As is everything he has written."
5,#2 in The Arthur Trilogy,"Enemy of God, #2 in The Arthur Books, was my favorite of the three. Reading these books was a great experience because knowing that I had the opportunity to continue the story and it not ending was so much fun...until I finished #3."
2,good at first,"I spent the $40 about 2 years ago to get this because I am new to Linux and I needed to dual-boot my machine (run both windows and Linux) and I didn't know how to do that. This install CD will setup your hard-drive, do the partitioning and the dual boot for you, so you don't have to be advanced. So that was great. I am still running this version, but the shell is missing so many typically 'traditional' Linux utilities that I now need, such as LaTeX compilation or a FORTRAN compiler. So, I looked into upgrading it, but you cannot upgrade. You can upgrade to v9.1, but the current version is 10 and there is no upgrade to v10, which is now supported by Novell. So I might spend the $60 now to get the Novell Suse Linux, but I'm not sure yet. I really need those compilers. So buyer beware."
1,Dont waste your money!,You can find all this stuff on the net for free! I recommend Debian (www.debian.org). It's not the easiest to configure but it is the best (9 CDs with all the free software out there).If you dont want to complicate your life go for Red Hat (www.redhat.com).
3,"Fair enough, I suppose","Since SuSe 8.0 I have been pretty faithful to the german distro, but this last one irritated me greatly. If you are looking for a good mid-level distro with a fair amount of control and stability and good mid-mix of products that come with it, here you go. It has a little bit of cake no matter what flavor you like to eat. Unfortuneately, being a linux user for some years, it didn't quite stand up to my expectations.For one, a lot of programs I am used to were either slightly out of date or missing. And due to the file structure of SuSe, it takes some long config file changes just to get stuff to install properly. Toss into the mix the fact that a lot of the programs it brags about are only on the profession edition, and you might want to go for the more expensive professional edition or download a free version of another distro instead.It is a good system, but not for me and probably not for others who know what they want unless it just happens to be what SuSe gives them."
1,"When you're not, you're not","Oh My Brothers, after trying to download Fedora for a month or so, decided to grab something off the shelf. Thinking Fedora was eventually a go - spent low bucks on SuSE - personal. Same box, same words as PRO, but cheaper. Decided to load over existing RedHat 6.2 - and guess what? IT COULD NOT DETECT A LOGITECH MOUSE and left me with no option but to REBOOT - until I became bored. Should've boughta couple cases of favorite beer instead. Spend NO bucks on SuSE - buy Slackware (same $$) or download from RedHat (eventually) and figure out the dependencies for thyself - it's more rewarding than throwing good money after SuSE.laze"
2,Good for honors....but confusing too. :l,"Length:: 2:03 Mins-8th grade honors student-Fantastic Teacher-Hard if you don't understand the concepts, looking back at the examples doesn't help-problems are way to hard or way too easy!2 Stars!!"
3,Unexpected,This was not the book I expected. It has a completely different cover than the one shown. I'm very disappointed. Hopefully at least maybe the material is still the same:( I'd have appreciated a different pic since that is what I actually got. ???
4,Thanks!,"This book was great! Some scribbles on some places, but overall pretty good. Bought the worked-out solution key and the turn out was good even though the years the books were published weren't the same."
3,don't listen to any thing u hear,"i am a student and this is what I needed, but when I got it, it wasn't really what I wanted. I know they say there isn't much difference but there IS indeed, I mean in every chapter you will not see Virgina but you will see new york in every single chapter! I'm not sure about the other stuff but this guy didn't really tell the truth."
4,Part of the Story.,"This short children's story tells part of the story told in THE INCREDIBLES. It explains how the supers (superheroes) returned from hiding. The story is told in comic book/story board format. The illustrations are very vivid and vibrant, having been designed from original frames from the movie. There isn't a whole lot here, but since THE INCREDIBLES are so incredible, I give the book a little higher ranking than the average movie tie-in fair. Great gift for kids or any fans of THE INCREDIBLES."
2,may be a good supplement,"This package contains four cassettes, two of them are for vocabulary (VocabuLearn), and two of them are for grammer (Learn in Your Car). The reason why I don't like is because that these tapes are bilingal, that is it reads one english sentence/word, followed an italian one, or vice versa. And also it pauses for quite a long time between each word or sentence. So I think it wastes time though I find that the grammer part of it is quite systematic and easy to follow. Anyway, it may be a good supplement for other italian course with more details and some exercises, but I do not believe it should be used alone."
5,Class that gets noticed,"To start off with this watch is very nice once you open the box. One thing you will realize is that size of the dial is smaller then expected. Plus the dial part already has a few light scratches on it just from one wear. Overall, besides these two issues the watches is great and people really do notice it when you wear it. Looks like a $1k+ watch. The diamonds are not that big and the silver part under it does most of the shining.Weight is nice not too heavy and not light by any means. Feels solid. Keeps time perfectly as you would expect from a watch like this. If you can buy this watch for $210 right now thats a steal given it MSRP's for $525 which I know regular store fronts ask MSRP. Given I was between a Citizen and the Bulova I'm glad I bought the Bulova since it is a lot more classier and seems better built.All in all its a great watch and look forward to my next Bulova to add to the collection."
5,"Beautiful watch, great price!",I bought this watch for my husband after he saw it at the mall for much much more $$$ then we really wanted to spend. I decided to search the web and found that Amazon had the best price around. He LOVES this watch and the price!
2,not actually waterproof,"I really did love this watch before it broke. It looks great and catches everybody's eye while remaining casual. I wore it every day and never took it off. Although it claims to be waterproof, I noticed after wearing it in the shower and swimming for several months, it started to get some condensation under the crystal. The internal parts rusted and it will never work again. It would cost more to fix the watch than to buy a new one."
5,Nice watch,This watch was an excellent buy and great quality. I have looked around for similar watches and none compared in price a watch of this quality. I would definitely recommend...it was a Christmas gift for my husband and he loved it!
5,Love this watch,"I have had this watch for over two years now and I have not taken it off. Never missed a beat! I will be a bulova customer for life. Little beat up but still very sharp lookin, no need to look further if you want reliable time piece for a fair price."
1,very upset,i ont know what it looks like cause i order this watch and never got it i call send messages and never got an answer they took my money and i never got my watch i dont know who to blame but i'm very upset
1,Good luck,Nice watch. Too bad the chronograph on the one I ordered broke after 5 1/2 weeks (with just normal wear/use). Not recommended for those who want a watch that works.
1,Stopped working after 4 years,"I really enjoyed the watch and received lots of compliments on how it looks until it just stopped working. I thought the battery was dead until the watch repair shop exmined the watch carefully ran a few tests with their equipment. They said ""it's not worth repairing. It's dead, and would cost too much to repair. You're better off buying another one."" I'll never buy from this dealer or from Bulova again."
3,"Love the watch, but defective","I purchased the watch through another seller (Watchsavings) on Amazon. I gave it to my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it. After three or four days, the inside of the watch face developed a wet spot. The seller wouldn't refund my money, and said they would only repair it. Besides that, I really did love the watch! The watch is not too flashy, but a classy, sporty style! I wouldn't recommend the seller."
5,Surprisingly Underrated 1989 Classic,"I really don't know where I should start with this review...I can remember when i was 7 years old, My dad had just gotten home from work holding this cd in his hands with a grin on his face, then he put the cd in...I can remember dancing to how great this cd was. To this day one of my favorite hip hop songs of all times is ""I Got It Made"". Its too bad that this album was forgotten, it deserves to be among the classics like ""It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back"", ""Straight Outta Compton"", ""All Eyez On Me"", ""Ready To Die"", and etc. So the final thing I wunna say to all u young hip hop heads out there trying to figure out whether to get this joint or not. Cop It and discover the REAL sense of Hip Hop Musick."
1,A huge waste of time reading this book,"The hero starts his business and builds it to a huge business with out one setback. Every female he meets just wants and does have sex with him. Thank God Mother Teresa did not meet him. The hero was not upset that his daughter ""blew"" her way to an academy award and more upsetting he showed no reaction when the daughter informed him she was having sex with her brother. All of his children from the many women he used became super successful in their field. The sex scenes were very good. I can only hope when Jack dies he goes straight to hell. Thats the sequel I would love to read next."
4,Great book!,"A lot of people dont like this book because they say that its a simple variation on the typical business storylines in Harold Robbins' books. I disagree. In this one...which, by the way, got me into reading Mr. Robbins, we have all sorts of business dealings, steamy sex, and it has a great retrospective on the media in contemporary society. You people need to lighten up. This was a good book, it was fun to read, and I think its got some of the better writing of the book. My only problem is...Mr. Robbin's dialogue isnt always great. Jack Lear, to me...is almost as interesting as Jonas Cord from The Carpetbaggers. Read this book. You wont be disappointed."
2,Quick Review,"Jack Lear is an ambitious pioneer of radio and television. Starting with the golden age of radio, through the rise of television, till the introduction of cable television, ""Tycoon"" tells the story of jacks rise to power in the business world while also dealing with the drama of his and his family's personal lives.Decent and enjoyable story for what it was. A bit of fluff that kept me entertained while reading."
4,quite intersting,the way the story goes and the way it ends simpy describes harold style..it is very good and interesting to read!!
2,"Implausible, tawdry, but entertaining","Was one of those airport book store purchases for me. Never read Robbins before and was dissappointed. Reading this book is a little like letting the TV linger on a Jerry Springer episode while channel surfing. You feel guilty for watching something so banal, but don't want to change the channel right away."
1,just another ludicrous lust and money tale,Typical Harold Robbins story line about a man with an ax to grind and the women he uses to climb to the top... this time in the broadcasting business.
4,perfect match for the bike,"This is a great fit, at a very fair price. They work great on the back as well, where you can wire into the brake light for a running light rear setup (this requires a bigger flasher relay - a regular car type will fit. Got mine at Advance Auto)."
5,F@#K WHAT YOU HEARD,"I DON'T NEED 1,000 WORDS.IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS ALBUM THEN YOU HAVE MISSED TWO OF THE GRIMIEST LYRICIST TO EVER TOUCH THE MIC SMOOTHE DA HUSTLER AND HIS BROTHER TRIGGA DA GAMBLER.THE FORMULA FOXY BROWN FLIPPED ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WAS BITTEN OFF OF SMOOTHE DA HUSTLER'S JAM HUSTLER.THEY EVEN OUTDID BIG DADDY KANE AND LITTLE DADDY SHANE ON BROKEN ENGLISH."
4,Why aren't you reading this book!,"Judging from the number of reviews posted for ""Tales of the City"", poeple obviously read that book and loved it. Yet no one chooses to comment on volume 2? READ IT! It's even more sick and twisted than the first. If that's possibel."
4,Just a little bit of a sophmore slump,"It's not as good as the first novel in the series, but good in and of itself. Maupin has the same style - light, with a lot of dialog, and plenty of odd and interesting plot turns, as in the first novel. I would recommend not reading them in succession, though. You need to read someone else to kind of clear your palette. He has the same characters and the continuity is a good thing, but I could do without the nicknames (Babycakes and Mouse)."
5,"Stay where you are Mouse, I'm coming over","OK, so it's not quiiiiiiite as good as the first one. But make no mistake about it - Michael Tolliver's coming out letter to his parents is one of the most significant, inspiring, empassioned, and beautifully articulated passages in the history of gay literature, and should be required reading for every gay man and woman, their friends, their parents, their families - and especially the Christian Right. It's worth the cover price alone for this stunning passage.But beyond that, there's still a heap of fun to be had by all; the seventies are beautifully evoked in all their carefree splendour, and Mouse remains one of the loveliest characters in modern fiction.Like a good wine, the series gets better with time. Savour it."
5,"Love, love, love","This series has been a favorite of mine since I was 18 years old. 16 years later I still find each story, each character, and every twist and turn a delight. Armistead Maupin is a genius put simply. 28 Barbury Lane is still if not more magical today than it was in the 1970's.My only wish is that the whole series be made available for the Kindle. Please."
1,STAY AWAY,"I gave 90.00 euros to have this product and i got nothing.It has dvd players that can not play dvds because ,in Suse , they find that it is illegal to use the dvds decryption software with the rest operating system.I took the updates and then suddenly i found that i cann't install rpms because of bugs.I couldn't use kppd , because i got error messages.And when i try to reach support , using the registration number , they answer to me that i must use their large database to have my answers.So much money to take something that in other linux distributions are better and much more inexpensive or FREE.Stay away from it.Linux is the best operating system and we are lucky to have a lot of other good distributions."
5,SuSE is Great!,"I recently made the switch ove5r to Linux, and I have to say, after trying other distributions I have fallen in love w/ SuSE !! Very comfortable operating system once you get by the wind0ze stigmatism! It gives you you're office, multimedia, and graphics packages as well as games for those who enjoy gaming. I highly recommend it, just have patience and you'll be amazed at what Linux (GNU) has to offer!!Monti-Las VegasSuSE Happy!"
2,not for professionals...,"The first impression is really good. But if you go into detail you won't be satisfacted. I think SuSE puts every software they find on the DVD/CD's and that's all. No quality review. For example there is no plugin for burning mp3 cd's with k3b. They just didn't compile it. And the services... The whole box is a big mess. The configuration (edit some configs,...) via shell is terrible because some settings will be ignored so you are forced to use yast.No. That's no Distribution for me. I will use Red Hat again..."
5,highly recommended,"An easy install. Download the evaluation and try, then buy. Downloading evaluation tedious & many drop server connections.Have dell 8200,philips dvd+ burner,adaptec firewire/usb pci card, dvd-ram&dvd-r external firewire drive, 2 firewire&usb hubs,usb san disk reader, wacom usb tablet, old panasonic printer,viewsonic VG171 lcd monitor for hardware. Everything works.Dual booting with winxp. Partitioned hard drive with Power Quest Partition Magic and then installed SuSe 9.0 Pro.Moved from Mandrake which will no longer install.Enjoy & best wishes."
1,Beware If You Own a Laptop with Internal Modem !,"I am a Windows XP user and decided to try this OS as something different.I got what I wanted unfortunatly, an OS that has No Support for my Sony Laptop PCG-GRX580,with a Win Modem.So basically this OS is useless to me for to try to connect to the internet as this is the main reason I purchased it as this is Suse Linux big claim of no viruses and no worms ,well I guess when you can't connect to the internet that would solve that problem!.I emailed the Suse support and finally received and email 1 week later, saying sorry no support.I paid close to $80.00 at BestBuyI also find that the price is going down on this product so this tells me it's not all it's cracked up to be.Finally Words: If Windows Works for you KEEP IT!If you have the Extra Money and Time to Waste try Suse Linux."
1,PC is now crashed thanks to Linux,"My PC has now crashed trying to install this horrible software. All of my information on my hard-drive (Windows) side is now unavailable, plus when I try to boot my machine it crashes with a kernel panic. Anyone who gives this 5 stars, PLEASE do not fall for their review. If you want to lose all information and have a PC that is trashed then this is for you.Now I understand why no one in their right mind uses this horrible, unstable mess."
1,No value to any user,"First off let me explain, I have heard how interesting linux is. One would think that is it has some use in the world of computers. But it has NO functionality other than the ability to change themes and icons on the desktop. Good grief, who cares about this kind of non-sense. I need to use business applications not some useless NON-supported freeware apps.To sum it up, my installtion of this product was very disappointing. The user interface dates back 5 years, there is a selection of useless applications, that CRASH often! No one seems to bring this up, plus it takes up like 5 gigs on the hard drive! What a bunch of useless BLOATWARE! So I tried it and wished I would have left well enough alone.Lastly, when it comes time to get your real work done. Buy Windows XP Professional and you will be extremely pleased!"
2,Very good but frustrating at first.,"This is a very complete operating system with a large library of free software. I had no trouble installing it (setup detected all my hardware on an IBM Thinkpad A20m), but was very frustrated at first with the interface. The documentation is difficult to read, and this is not for beginners.After a few days of using Linux, I've found that I can do everything I need to do with it, and even run my windows programs on it. However, it took the better part of a day for me to understand how to configure things. The GUI they start you off with is terrible but by changing a few settings it becomes very functional and friendly."
1,Disappointing,"After 4 days talking to their support group, it is finally known to me that they do NOT support 32-bit Seriel ATA Hard Drives. So I have wasted 4 evenings and countless phone calls with these guys before they figured that they don't support me, which is a fairly common hardware config now days. So beware!!"
3,Solid music from a Solid Group,I have followed this band through their time before they went Major but even before they changed their name to Sister 7. I would reccommend this album for people who like good jamming from the Texas Blues funk. Get it and the others I am sure you will dig it.
3,Nicky Epstein's Knitted Flowers,"I went ahead and purchased this book despite the somewhat boring patterns. There are a handful of flowers that are really pretty, but the majority of the patterns are rather dull. It's nice to have, but not a book to run out and purchase. I believe that Nicky Eptstein's ""Knitted Embellishments"" is a much better book."
3,Nicky has had better,Not what I had expected. The yarns used in the book are yarns that are hard to find or that I have never heard of before. The patterns are not very exciting. Too many felted projects. I am actually thinking of returning it. I have seen better flower patterns in the free patterns and the knitting magazines.
3,I want more bang for my buck.,"For the price this book does not have enough flower patterns. I was rather disappointed and clearly expected more from this book. The author's other books are chock full of patterns, but I found this one lacking. The patterns could have either been written a touch more simple or were in need of much more detail to execute. The pictures are very pretty, but that doesn't make up for the fact that I feel I over paid for this book. It is one thing to buy something pretty, but quite another to buy an instruction book lacking in instructions. I would have prefered many many more pictures of how the flowers were executed as opposed to the finished product."
4,A yarn garden!,"I have not tried to knit any of the flowers yet, but I read the whole book from beginning to the end when I got it. The instructions are easy to understand, even for me who is not a native English speaker/reader. The pictures are beautiful, almost all of them show the technique clearly. Some (few) of the pictures are not very easy to compare to the following instruction. I begin to understand what a great artist Nicky Epstein is, and she is willingly sharing her art with her knitting sisters.One negative comment: The text is not always good to read on the chosen background color. That can be a problem for knitters with an eyeproblem."
2,Awful book,"Very dull pictures. variety of flowers is really bad.It doesn't worth that money. If you really interested in flowers knitting or crocheting I would strongly recommend100 Flowers to Knit & Crochet: A Collection of Beautiful Blooms for Embellishing Garments, Accessories, and More"
1,Dont be a sucker...,Download of Dungeons & Dragons Online is free and normal subscription price is about $15.00/month IF you pay once a month. If you pay once every three months subscription is more like $12.00/month. You can subscribe even cheaper if you pay once a year. The idiots trying to sell this 60 day game card for 62.50 are simply fishing for suckers. Dont be a sucker....
2,All Cobra Radios are bad!!!!,They are not good radios! they do not function right and always break. I'm from a company who rates diffrent dadios do not come out on top. Out of 350 radios tested it can out as 310th it is a waste of money! I would suggest a Talkabout 280 good price and good everything.
1,WASTE OF MONEY FOR BEGINNERS,I couldn't be more disappointed with this course. All this program has to offer is a litany of words and phrases that would probably be beneficial to someone who already has had formal instruction in the Japanese language. I strenuously reccomend looking at something else if you want to learn Japanese from a rock-bottom beginner level.
4,Spiritual comet,"I started reading this book while Comet Hale-Bopp was at its brightest. I quickly came to understand that journalist/novelist Dan Wakefield's journey was the spiritual version of a comet. He begins with a fairly typical midwest Christianity, then moves to agnosticism, then moves to atheism, then moves to attending a Unitarian church, within which he moves back into Christianity.His journey, like that of a comet, took him far from his home, his roots, his faith, his God, to the cold and darkness that filled his life. But when the return journey began, like a comet, his life grew brighter as he came nearer to the faith that he found to be the center of his journey.As he looks back, Dan Wakefield sees the ways that God has been with him throughout the long journey. Like the gravity that calls a distant comet to make its journey back toward the sun, so was God pulling on Wakefield. Reading the story of his return was more stimulating than watching Hale-Bopp on its journey."
4,Excellent Pictures,"This book has excellent pictures of everyday life in Kenya with simple descriptions. There is also a short fact sheet and good glossary in the back of the book. My only problem is with the circumcision definition in the glossary. It states, ""circumcisions: the removal of parts of certain sexual organs in males or females."""
5,Wonderful,"All I can say is WONDERFUL....But, it doesn't last that long. I would suggest finding the body lotion to go along with this fragrance. The smell is heavenly!"
4,Flashdance tradition carried on with this LP with Giorgio,"This album is great, if you loved Flashdance and wanted more of the same thing then this is the LP. The songs has 4 top ten hits that hit the top of the American chart, why me, breakdance, what a feeling and the dream. The bonus track talk too much is one here with 12 inch remixes of the hits for the first time on CD and very hard to get on Vinyl. My favourites apart from the singles are Romance 93, you were made for me and talk too much. With the extra 12 inch remixes and the originals including dance remixes of Flashdance - this is a gem of an album."
1,"really, whos gonna buy this cd at this price????","really, this cd for this price. really. For that price you guys can keep it. good luck selling it. The cd is old and sounds dated...."
2,Why Me?,"Where the hell is the 45 version of ""Why Me?"" Why couldn't the people who released this disc realize that we would want the hit version THAT WE FELL IN LOVE WITH and made the Top 40??!!Come to think of it: where is a Greatest Hits package for Irene Cara?"
3,BEWARE!,"Why is ""Why Me"" so hard to find in its original version? I purchased this CD after noticing ""Why Me"" was on it. Much to my disamazement, this version is the 12"" mix and totally different than the original album version. They should have at the very least included the original version, plus the 12"" version if they wanted to be generous. The rest of the CD takes me back to my high school days, but I'm still looking for the original ""Why Me"" version and will continue to look."
2,This CD Is Just Whatever,"I like Irene Cara. She's a pretty good actress and a good singer. However, this CD was boring and the only song that grabbed me was ""Flashdance. . .What a Feeling."" Other than that, I wouldn't waste my money on this. Get something from Angela Bofil instead."
1,Poorly Written,It appears the author sat at home while sending other people out to do the research for this book. It's not a first hand account and I returned the book one day after purchasing it. There are much better books out there about the best NYC has to offer for dogs.
5,My Mom's response was priceless,"I haven't actually read this book- my Mom did while she was pregnant with me, and upon also learning about the 8-year-old author's personal history (her parents, like my Mom,had rejected their prescribed life plan) decided to name me after her. The origin of my name has been an oft-repeated part of family lore so when I found myself low on funds I did some online searches (I didn't know the author's last name), found it and then got it for my Mom's birthday. Ma loves to read, and loves poetry, too, so I consider the fact that she was moved enough by the young author's work to name me after her to be quite an endorsement. (She loved getting the book, by the way- she hadn't seen a copy since choosing my name!)"
5,Milka White Chocolate,"This is my husband's favorite chocolate. ""The best I've ever had in my life.""I purchased 10 bars for him for Chirstmas. There is one bar left as of 1/15."
4,Handy dandy little phrase book,"This is a very convenient little book to have with you if you travel to France and/or if you're taking a beginning French course. It's getting a little dated and some of the sections are fairly esoteric; e.g., seeing eye dogs and wheelchairs, but it has a lot of info in a easy to carry package."
2,okay i guess,"This is okay but you're almost better off ""roughing it"" over there. Good phrase book and cd but unless you're planning on staying over in France for a while, not worth it."
1,Hard to understand,+ sturdy construction+ intro to many topics+ problems at end of chapter have page reference of the answer- shallow coverage of too many topics- some key learning points are left to the student in an intro book- poor formatting and organization= an intro book that doesn't build enough on the foundations and tries to cover too much in this growing field
3,It's alright...,"The best review I can give for this book is this: it's OK.It's not terribly thorough, but it's easy to read. You're going to need some supplementary publications in order to fill in the gaps it leaves or just to answer the questions you will probably have popping up in your head.I'd recommend reading this before anything else, though. All the other books are so immensely difficult to actually force yourself through that this provides a great ""starter"" so you're better prepared for what everyone else is going to throw at you."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"Maybe I should have been move savy to check the song before I bought this CD,... But this CD does Not have the Popular version of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". I was really disappointed when I first played the CD. Bummer! Oh Well, Live and Learn."
4,Wise book indeed,Great resource book for women that are looking for open minded alternative options to deal with menopause. I am a well informed biologists and I have to say that this is the first time that I find a book with all types of recommendations based on women's level of comfort. I highly recommend this book.
5,A book every woman needs!,This is the number one book every woman should have on her bookshelf!I have read it 3 times over in less than a week and still find the greatest nuggets of info.....my only regret is not having it sooner!Every woman no matter her age will benefit from this book.Kim
4,The Wise Woman Way,"This book was actually recommended by my doctor. It is exactly as expected - probably more. It has clear information that is easy to understand and offers approaches that are easy to implement. My sister wants to borrow it, but she may have to buy her own!"
2,A Mixed Bag,"I did not like this book and thought it was very wacky. First of all, I did not appreciate the author telling me to think of myself as a crone because I am going through/ in menopause. The writing style was silly-with each chapter beginning with an older voice telling you how you should feel about all the changes going on. It was like a fairy tale. I can not say how accurate the information she gave for vitamins and herbs was but I didn't like when she said never have your ovaries removed and then didn't follow up about what would happen once they are removed. She is very anti hormone and while they may not help some women, they may be the right thing for others. The book goes overboard on natural remedies and does not supply any scientific or medical information to back up her claims. I'm glad I didn't buy this book-instead I took it out from the library. Read this book with a critical mind and don't accept it as truth. It's interesting but I don't believe everything in it."
5,"Welcome to ""The Changes""!","I've had this book for several years and love it. It's my favorite reference book whenever peri/menopause rears its ugly head! It's a real eye opener to see how many changes occur in the body during the menopausal years. This book's natural and herbal suggestions help make those sometimes difficult changes less aggravating and challenging. I'm buying 3 more copies to give to some ""almost 40"" friends who think they're too young for perimenopause. Sorry ladies, the 30's are not too young!!"
3,Be Warned!,"This book is decent enough from a New Age-y approach, and the herbal information seems to be quite good. However, be warned that the author irresponsibly advises against such potentially life-saving diagnostic procedures as routine mammograms."
2,Spools come loose and end up in the river,"These are very nicely constructed reels, however, the spring mechanism that holds the spool to the spindle shaft is not a very good design. I have 3 Galvan reels and all of them have eventually begun to have the same problem: You put the spool on the shaft and feel the positive click engagement -- indicating the spool is set, then later on (often times when fighting a big fish) the spool comes off: sinking in the river a few times. I kept kind of ""quiet"" about this for sometime, since Galvan are such high end reels, thinking it must be something I am doing wrong. However, after cleaning, trying different lubricants, no lubricant, this problem still exists."
2,Ted Turners whoops on history again,"While the film looks good the biggest problem I have is that the producers put German machine gunners fighting on the side of the Spanish!!!!!!! How ludicrous. The American expedition to Cuba was accompanied by a German military observer. In any case being a student of the Spanish-American war if the Spanish had had machine guns operated by Germans or other wise the US ground war in Cuba would have failed.God only knows why the producers couldn't follow reality but it killed an otherwise ""watchable"" movie."
2,Boring,"I am a junior in high school and for the past three days our history class has watched this film. I respected its point and purpose, but I must say it was one of the most uneventful and unexciting films I have ever seen. It never grabs your attention and starts to get repetitive. Unless you plan on a nap, I don't recommend this film."
4,When Will this come out on DVD????,"Great movie, but deserving of a DVD release at the earliest opportunity. When????"
4,Rough Riders,The movie Rough Riders is a must have action packed explosive movie. It is provocative and in some parts sad. It will make you think of how the times were back then. This 2 part movie is great.
4,Rough riders indeed!,"I don't know a lot about the US-Spanish war in Cuba, but I did like this dramatisation of parts of it! Mind you, I could watch Gary Busey standing at the street corner and like it, but seriously, thought this was a good story, well told."
5,EXCELLENT MOVIE,"I saw this when it first came out and was interested in viewing it again. I am not disappointed in the least in my decision to purchase it, was well worth the money. The casting was excellent"
5,When? And what?,Whhen is this finally coming out on DVD? And what do we have to do to convince this movie company it can make major money by doing this?
3,Disappointing,"The most disappointing thing about this movie is that on the end, the movie is losing it as far as history is concerned. I have read every book on the Spanish American war, including the book Theodore Roosevelt wrote himself, and it is sad that such a well researched series gives in to inaccuracies and stoops to propaganda. What I am referring to is the depiction of German Advisors to the Spanish troops. There is not one word about advisors in any of the books, on the contrary, Theodore Roosevelt speaks of a German Count(German Attache) very well and that he was a ""good man""! That the movie lowers itself to not so nice a human trait is disappointing."
3,"Theodore Roosevelt was a ""rougher"" rider!","""The Rough Riders"" was a good movie. It is about time there was a movie made about the Spanish-American war and this group of men.The action (battle) scenes in the movie were very vivid and realistic without being too graphic.My biggest complaint with the movie is the way Theodore Roosevelt was portrayed. The movie showed this great man as a buffoon who fell down like a clod several times. While Roosevelt was not a true military officer who graduated from a military school; however, he certainly was not the idiot that this movie portrayed him to be.The movie also explained the charge on San Juan Hill as a mistaken order gave by a delirious officer. This is more Hollywood then History, in my opinion.I wish the movie would have showed Roosevelt for the brave, almost to the point of suicide, man that I believe he really was. I think he would have turned in his grave to see himself portrayed as a bumbling idiot who lucked into everything."
1,Master Killer Deception,"This is NOT the ""Master Killer"" I was looking for as I have been a fan of both ""The Master Killer"" and ""The Return of the Master Killer"". The ""Master Killer"" series I remember had Gordon Liu fighting Japanese ninja warriors in a quest to prove the superior style of martial arts. I would love to return and exchange this series for the correct ones.Michael Clarke"
5,excellent,"I have 5 of the battery powered units and will install this in the heated garage next to the ceiling. I hung one of the battery powered units and according to one review, didn't recommend this, I tried that before ordering, and with no problems for about 1 month. I will now try one of the battery powered units in the shop about 150 feet away, and then in an out shed, also 150'. If that works, the 2 more units"
4,Easy to install,Bought 6 to replace existing expired set. Easy to install. Works great.Getting them to silence is challenging but it does work
5,Wireless smoke alarm,I had to install interconnected smoke alarms for a recent remodel to bring my house up to code. These work as advertised in my two story plus basement house. Half the price of having an electrician start crawling throught he attick and cutting holes in walls.
5,This product solved my problem,"Recovering from a house fire is never a pretty task. We were faced with the necessity of upgrading the smoke detection system in our home because the damaged area needed to be brought up to current code. We could install smoke detectors in five rooms damaged by the fire and interconnect them easily with hard wire, but we had an existing smoke detector on another floor that could not be hard wire connected. Purchasing two of these units allowed for all of the detectors in our home to be interconnected without the necessity of tearing up any more of the house.The system works great. Now, if any of the detectors activates, they all go off (yes, the noise gets our attention) and the alarm can be silenced from any unit, too. Then it is possible to find which unit alarmed by looking at the indicator light.Just what we needed. I would recommend this system for anyone needing similar capability."
3,Good product but life span was 1/3 used up when received,Kidde says these smoke alarms have a 10 year life span from the date of manufacture. Well when I got mine it was made in 2005 so I only have 7 years left till I need a new one. Do I get 1/3 price reduction?
5,Great Discipleship Material,9 teens and I (59 years old man) are using this workbook as part of our discipleship experience. I supplement the discipleship with daily devotional time sharing. Our pace is way slower than the book suggests. One day's work is a week for our group. I highly recommend this workbook for discipleship.
1,Another egg laid by the Chickens,Shouldn't have made this album. What drivil. Don't waste your money or time.
4,Pre-Natalie Chicks,"Shouldn't A Told You That lacks all the Chick attitude that we've fallen in love with today, but it's still an exceptional CD. I Wasn't Looking For You and I'm Falling Again are beautiful songs. This CD needs to be re-released and put in every country fan's collection!"
1,virtual boxing game,Never worked. I tried changing batteries and changing locations and nothing happened. Don't waste your money.
2,Not essential for your Africa trip,"I purchased a used copy of the most recent edition of this book in preparation for a trip to Africa. In the past, I have been thrilled with LP Trekking guides. Their New Zealand book was invaluable in helping me find trails and plan a trip. East Africa, however, falls short. The book focuses on Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Because I already had a copy of LP East Africa, I found almost no useful information in this book. In my opinion, the information in the trekking guide is duplicated in the East Africa guide. I would recommend just getting the East Africa book."
3,a crack on the rear edge,"As this product has received glowing report from others, I can only conclude that I got a lemon. I report on my experience as a warning to others that there may be more lemons out there. Though right out of the box, the pieces appeared to be sturdy and well made, it was not long before I noticed that a crack on the rear edge of the desk's surface had been repaired with glue."
4,Laptop Desk,"As advertised, very good quality. I am entirely satisfied with this product.I use it as a laptop stand/desk when I am using my computer in my bedroom where space is limited."
4,Great Desk for the money,I bought this for my sons room and was surprised at the quality of the desk for the price. I used a little wood glue on the hutch section to help tighten the fit - since I read that it was a loose fit in the other reviews. He's been doing his homework on it nightly and it really fits nice into a smaller room. The color is not bad either and fits well with his other furniture (pecan and Cherry wood) I would recommend this for anyone looking for a good older kids desk (8yrs+) or as a writing/task desk for smaller spaces.
3,"Good desk, bad finish","Nice desk. Arrived in good condition and assembled easily. Decent quality wood and little use of cheap materials. However, I disagree with the ""slightly"" orange remarks from others. This thing IS orange. Gonna get a white paint bath very soon. Like the desk, hate the color."
4,Very nice,"I needed a smaller writing desk for my living room and really like this desk. Quality is good, easy to assemble, nicely finished.I'm not giving it a five-star rating because the ""skirt"" of the desk is low, and you can't cross your legs under it. I'm 5'6"", if you are taller then this desk will be too low for you. Otherwise I really like this desk, it's attractive and works well for a laptop or light use."
3,very orange,ordered this desk for my very tiny living room so we didnt have much space to work with~ the size is perfect and exactly what we needed for a family computer space. works very well with our laptop. ordered this desk over the holidays wasnt supposed to recieve it for over 10 days and i got it in 2 days very very pleased with the fast shipping and easy access to track the package. put it together with ease but the wood is AWEFUL very very very orange...good sturdy wood but i will be refinishing this once i have time. other then the color i am very pleased.
4,Great Value,I bought this as a homework desk for my 7-year-old. It is the perfect size student desk for smaller rooms. It is a great value for the price since it is solid wood and sturdy. Assembly was easy. This is a unique design that I haven't seen anywhere else in these dimensions.My only complaint is the color. I wish they offered it in different stains. The honey tone has a slight orange hue to it. I was able to easily faux finish for a more modern look. Well worth the extra work though.
3,Color is the worst,goes together easy. then you see color. comes apart easy so you paint it. then it works well simple desk works well just bad color
4,Nice looking,"The desk is very nice looking and is definitely ""orange"" colored, but looks nice in kids room. The hutch was very hard to attach with the given screws, but otherwise easy to assemble."
5,What a value,"Just received my desk today and couldn't be happier. Easy assembly, quick shipping, fits perfectly. Love the color, kind of an orange-tinted wood. Doesn't look cheesy though."
2,So So desk,"This desk was made in Thailand. I assume that means that the wood was cut and finished in that country. Which leads to the next question: Beechwood is native to Eastern US. Did someone import this wood out of the US all the way to Thailand and then re import it back to the US as a finished product? I really doubt this stuff is Beechwood. But, whatever it is, it is not particle board covered with a wood veneer.The top drawer section is really crudely made and the screw holes were missing. The wood screws supplied are of such cheap quality that the phillips head on them literally disintegrates after 3 turns of a screwdriver. The big bolts used for the legs are okay.I paid $122 for this item and it is shown listed as $195. Even at $122 someone is making an obscene profit because we all know how cheap labor is in Thailand...pennies on the dollar. Shame on Amazon for accepting and selling items like this....obviously Amazon does not believe in the concept of Fair Trade."
2,Most comics bor-ing,"Okay, so I bought this comic for the sole wish I had: To read ""Cool Hand Bart"". I find ALL the S.B episodes on the TV show are brilliant (I make an exception for ""Day of the Jackanapes"") but the others are just boring, mostly. ""Cool Hand Bart"" isn't really that interesting either, though I like that bit with ""Saying 'boss' here, boss!"" haha.Still, I advise you against buying this. Treehouse of Horror comics are way better."
5,"Great DVD, Great Series!","As a long-time Aikido student, I was looking for an off-the-mat way to enhance my sense of ki (qi). After viewing a few tapes showing different approaches to Wild Goose One, I found myself most drawn to what Dr. Hu was doing. The biggest surprise for me has been that, though I was expecting a serene, meditative experience from Wild Goose, I also found myself with a feeling of having had a somewhat vigorous full-body workout. Even more importantly, the notion of qi through these movements seemed to quickly move from the abstract to the rather concrete. I've now been through the entire series (9 DVDs) and highly recommend them. They are very well done!"
1,I'll let you call it,"This album was terrible his worst. The phrases coming in to his own as a mc is a bunch of bull. He spits the same trash that he did in 2000. Only problem mainstream america wasent listening. Thats when he was sick, cause he was young raw and uncut. Dude's like a free agent now reppin nyc tryin be a nyc mc. I don't know a lot of people in the south listening to this guy, only white suburnites in smalltown nowhere do. This is waterdowned easily assesible clown music for people that don't know any better. Folks dont wanna be there own person when it comes to music let me listen to what is fashionable at the time let me fit in, cookie cutter f***. Gipp goodie, Backbone, Pt cruiser, Kenoe, Hakim, BG, Gar, Sniper still puttin out ""Real"" south music that folks actually listen to in the south. Onehundred"
3,ok,"I cant call this album a total waste becuase I like atleast 4 songs...the intro is awesome. Carter 2 cant touch The (first)Carter. Overall, its ok...you'll be dissapointed if you expect to enjoy the entire cd. Honorable mentions **The Mob, Fly In, Money on my mind, Oh No.***"
1,Worst ever,"I can not figure out for the life of me why so many people think this album is worth half a star... Apparently none of these reviewers have ever listened to weezy's mixtapes and ""good"" albums because this album completely sucks. I actually got this cd a few days before it was released and ended up trashing it by the time i skipped through to the last song. This cd does not contain one good beat, and the b.s. on the radio should stay there instead of in your collection. I thought i was a big fan of wayne, but after this album he has lost my respect as an artist. Get back to the ""the fix"" beats and raps dude! AND WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO ALL THE GOOD SONGS FROM THE LAST ALBUM!???"
5,Weezy Doesn't Disappoint...,"Lil Wayne triumps over the spectators with the follow up to ""The Carter"". This album shows his growth from ""The Block Is Hot"" to now ""Fireman"". Not to mention the diversity that he displays on the album as it goes forward. He, now, no longer has to prove to critics that he can do it without the help of Baby or even Mannie Fresh. In this rate, he can replace artists that are out there right now. This is an album to add to your collection."
2,Not for me,The beats weren't as good as I would like. The songs were not my style. Others say this is his best. Just not for me.
2,grossly overrated,"Weak beats. Pales in comparison to the other ""Carters"". Be honest, can you hum the melody from any of the tracks on this album? Lyrical skills are only half of the equation, they can't ride alone."
1,"No stars... I agree with ""Reason hip hop is trash these days...""","Wtf is wrong with you people... and for the guy who actually dared to refer to a mainstream dumba$$ like Lil Wayne as ""best rapper alive""..I feel sorry for you because you are an idiot. Usually I wouldn't even bother to make these comments because it is pretty much useless to try and ""enlighten"" those so brainwashed by the commercial TRASH out there... sigh... pick up Kweli's new cd or something, please.. let's keep real hip hop alive.."
1,The Reason Hip Hop is Garbage Nowadays,"this is album is str8 up trash...those giving it 5 stars must all be under the age of 20 and dont know what real hiphop is...its albums and rappers like this nowadays that are going to be the downfall of hiphop music..everything on this album sounds the same,he raps about nothing and his voice is weak and annoying..do yourself a favor...save your money,unless your a fan of the same repetitive music thats being put out today ex. all the bling bling,rims type crap."
1,Garbage.,"What the hell happened to Wayne?!, He use to be one the bestnow he's been runnin' up in Trina so fast he's killed his braincells. His style isn't the same anymore because he flowed sodifferent on ""The Block Is Hot"" and ""Lights Out"" which wasworth buying. Now he rhymes slower than he use to and his voiceand his catch phrases is annoying. Therefore, Wayne didn't always rap like this. Let's not get started on the beats,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, Oh My God!Let's just say that Weezy F. Baby took a trip from the N.O.to New York. There is no crunk songs on here not what so ever,this is not a real southern rap album at all. Rap music is justnot the same anymore because I know real music when I here itand this definitely not it and i'm only 18. You want something that is real New Orleans,go pick up the new Master P album on Gutta Music Ent,""Livin' Legend: Certified D-Boy""."
5,Best Tha Carter album,"I have all three Tha Carter albums. Tha Carter is okay but its not great. The third Tha Carter Dwayne got a too big of head. But this Tha Carter is great it doesnt suck and hes not big headed. I listen to this album a lot. When I first began listening to rap Lil Wayne was my favorite, I heard him all the time and loved his voice, now i've grown into better things. Lil Wayne only talks about girls money and drugs, but in this album you have more than that, hes full of himself but he wasnt super famous yet."
4,"The ""Bayou Kid"" is back......","Lil' Wayne once again puts the rap industry on notice. Tha Carter 2 is one helluva album. Credit must be given to Lil' Wayne and his team on surviving the untimely departure of the finest producer in the business, Mannie Fresh. I must admit, at first I was a little skeptical after learning this, but Lil' Wayne shows astonishing growth without Mannie by laying down some of his hottest lyrics to date. Beats/Productions are solid, but not Mannie great, and the lyrics are second to none. Lyrically, this is by far Lil' Wayne best work, and in my opinion the best is yet to come. **** 4 stars"
3,Average to me,"I'm not saying Lil Wayne isn't raw and doin' it big right about now.I bought this CD late after hearing all the great reviews like this was a masterpiece.This LP is by no means bad. It's much better than the majority of what's been dropping lately in hip hop circles, but this CD honestly puts me to sleep.Like I said, this isn't bad at all but I definitely think Wayne's got better days coming.His flow is cool, his wit is average and his rhymes are also average in my book.I'm not a Wayne fan but I try to recognize heat when the so-called best rappers come wit it.Sorry y'all, I'm not hatin' but I'm just not feelin' this album the way I've felt undisputed masterpieces from greats like TuPac, Nas, Jay-Z, Scarface, OutKast, Kool G. Rap, GhostFace and UGK.Maybe I'm missed something?"
3,"Nice, not as good as the 1st one though","I was disappointed, but its still a good look. Lil wayne is getting better and better."
4,"Very dissapointed, not in Young Money, but in These Reviewer's","Good album, its a album that got me in 2 his music. the mobb, best rapper alive, and Hustler Musik, its hard 2 give this album a five, cuz im very judge mental on album's being a 5, that means the whole album classic, this album's not classic, everybody said this boy came out hard, Not really Bossman comes HeLLa Harder. these fools say ""HE SPITS FIRE"", but IN MY MIND, WEEZY GOTS MAD SKILLS AND SEEMS 2 hold Them Back.thats why i gave it 4, he lacks the ability 2 just be like F*ck it and go out and murder a track. it left me wanting more so i say carter 1 is alot better. after listening 2 both of them i think his fans made the carter 2 sound better then it was."
3,HOPE THA CARTER III WILL BE BETTA,"I DON'T KNOW BUT LISTENING 2 FIREMAN AS THE 1ST SINGLE OUTTA THIS LP I WAS WAITIN' 4 ANOTHER KINDA ALBUM...THE PRODUCTION IS LACKING A GOOD VIBE...I JUST SAVE FIREMAN,BEST RAPPER ALIVE AND THE THICKE FEATURED & PRODUCED TRACK: SHOOTER...,EVEN GROEWN ASS MAN ISN'T THAT BAD....I REALLY WAS WAITIN' 4 MORE,I CAN'T SEE ALL THIS APPRECIATION THEY SHOW 4 WAYNE....!"
5,"Weezy Baby, PLEASE SAY THE BABY...","LOVE WEEZY BABY, His voice always makes my day. This album is CCCRRRAAAZZZYYY! Even though, Weezy dont write his own lyrics and kisses his friend on the lips, I am forever a fan!! Best tracks are1. Money on my Mind2. Mo' Fire3. Fireman (HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!)4. Best Rapper Alive5. Oh No6. Hit'em Up7. Hustler Musik8. Shooter9. Weezy BabyTrust me, ITS WORTH YOUR MONEY! DONT BUY BOOTLEG!!!"
3,"wayne wayne wayne ""shakez my head""","lil'wayne was smokin some serious dope when he decided not to work with manny fresh...the beats on here are mostly whack and dosn't have dat durty south feel to it..cash money fell off like old weave and they still are tryin to go hard...they will neva be the same w/o the hot boyz ""b.g. ,juvenile ,and turk """
1,Fake,This dude is a bitch and his message is shallow. If you liike bitch rappers like drake and Nicki Minaj than you will like this. Fans of Hip-hop stay away.
3,WOW! A decent Southern Rapper,"Ok personally I would rather listen to heavy metal (and I hate heavy metal)Than most southern rap. If rap music dies out southern rap will probably be the reason, but this guy is an exception. He's lyrically better than even alot of the New York M.C.'s around now. I hope the south will start embracing him instead of complaining about the fact that he dosen't sound as bad as their other rappers. It's not a New York Style that he's doing, what he's doing is RAP (as opposed to the rest of that stuff that you hear down there). If you have never bought A southern Rap album you should seriously consider this one. This is a guy that shouldn't be ignored."
5,the carter 2,This review is written by Mr. Bradberrry's students:this is lil waynes beat album!to responce to all critcal revewsthis album is not to long and his so called exises in lengthehis creativity is ausom and the fact that the majority ofhis songs are off the dome or free style raping is minde blowing thefore i fell this album is his best even better than the most antispated carter 3are favrite track from this labum is go DJ cause it is not to long not toshort it ryms and the it is just perfect this album prooved to me thatlil wayne is the best raper alive.
5,str8 drop,I'm a dipset fan but Weezy is the hottest out right now. He came hard w/ this one. Every song is straight piff.
2,Hello people this is a mixtape not an album!,"I dont see how anybody can call this an album. This is a mixtape. Lil Wayne basically freestyled through the whole album!The beats are bland and only a few of Wayne's freestyles are tight. Standout freestyles: THE MOBB, MONEY ON MY MIND, FIREMAN, OH NO, HIT EM'UP and IM A DBOY. Filler freestyles: shooter, receipt, grown man, feel me, hustler music, mo fire etc. lock and load is a boring track and Kurupt is whispering in the hook (WTF!). Its obvious that he was trying to get an up north fanbase to buy this s---. The majority of reviewers who gave him five stars come from up north. Lil Wayne's best albums are LIGHTS OUT AND THE CARTER. Lil Wayne at his worst: THE BLOCK IS HOT, 500 DEGREES and THE CARTER 2."
2,weezy....................... no! the block just got cold,"weezy... excuse me! birdman JR. need mannie on the board, straight up. ""mannie fresh keep playin that song on & on til the break of dawn"". credit to president weezy f. baby for his flow, but da carter 2 shouldn't be in the same store as da carter. w/o fresh music...... i won't spend next weeks money on nothin else. oh, what up lil carl........ big cousin.... wavin. cash money fans.... check out lil carl on birdman's last album. i'm gettin up."
2,Aint nothin to brag about,"I really wasnt impressed with this cd, his mixtape ""The Suffix"" is better than this album. I wasted my money."
3,"I ALL READY KNEW THIS WAS NOT GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS CATER VOL1...NO DISS TO WAYNE,BUT HIS FLOW IS STARTING TO SOUND LIKE JAY-Z","WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS ALBUM... I WAS HEARING A SEAN CARTER ALBUM INSTEAD OF A WAYNE CARTER ALBUM...BEFORE YOU BUY THIS,YOU MIGHT WANT TO RECONSIDER!!...IF YOU WONT TO GET IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FIRST BE MY GUESS!!"
1,WTF,when i first hurd this album i wuz very disappointed. the only song that had that dirty south feel wuz #3. the rest of it wuz garbage. it sounds like he is droppin his down south sound for a nyc style. i still respect him as an artist though because he have put out classics in my mind prior to this album.
4,good but missing vanilla ice and will smith,You see this would be a classic if it had vanilla ice and will smith THE TWO GREATEST RAPPERS EVER...you can tell lil wayne stole his rap style from vanilla ice. WHITE POWER
2,Best Rapper Alive since the best rapper retired,Tha Mobb is the best song to open an album up with. He spits fire for five minutes straight with out a hook. I love every song. Its another classic like Tha Carter. The beats are off the chain and Weezy never lets you down with the swift lyrics and the play on words. I love it!!! Keep up the good work Weezy. If you don't own Tha Carter II somethings wrong with you...
2,Cash Money is officially dead...,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a long time CMR supporter. I have all the albums. But now that Mannie is gone, there is nothing left but Lil' Wayne and he suffers without the backing of the best producer in the south. None of the beats are worth listening too. They sound like throwed together guitars under too heavy bass with some ugly samples for good measure. Fireman is the only decent song. Even the Chopped bonus disc is sub par. It sounds low and muffled for some reason. Lil' Wayne's flow is still growing and he's definitely one of the best in the game, but this effort just shows how much a good producer means to any artist. I was definitely dissappointed, especially after getting my hopes up after loving the now classic Carter 1 album. I can only hope that Mannie hooks back up with Juvy and B.G. and gets back to makin hits again. R.I.P. CMR..."
3,"Come on, Weezy!!","First of all let me say that I love Lil' Wayne, he's one of the best rappers out there, but this cd was not tight. There were only a few songs on there that rolled and the others got skipped. I don't know what he was thinking with this one, because i was straight up disappointed. After the first Carter, which was super tight, came out i couldn't wait for this one, but when i put it in i wanted to throw it out the window. Weezy, we all know you can get down with the best of them, come harder next time, please. *OnE LoVe*"
4,Man listen...,"People have been sleepin' on Weezy for years! If this album don't wake 'em up, I don't know what will. As usual, Weezy spits the illest rhymes the south has ever heard, and he may in fact be the best rapper alive, since I've yet to see anyone challenge him in ANY sort of way. Only two other artists are on the album, and they're doin' hooks! Nothin' but Weezy flowin' from 'Tha Mobb', until it's time to 'Fly Out'! Be easy..- Mike"
3,The BOY could have done better this time around.,"I dont know if its me, but i think Wayne could have done just a little bit better on this cd. I think he's trying to be more of an eastcoat rapper this time around. Although he does have some hot tracks, like ""Moneys On My Mind"", and ""The Mobb"". I have to say that the real Lil Wayne just aint what he use to be."
3,"Not bad,but missing Manny Fresh","I gotta hold the fact that Manny Fresh ain't on board against this Project. Lil Wayne been a good Rapper for a while,but the direction he needed to go in hadn't been fully established. the Lyrical&Overall vibe of this Project is cool,but it's about 5-6 tracks too long. also the Beats ain't touching Manny Fresh level. credible Production,but not the kind of Beats that would take this Album higher.drop some tracks&tighten up the beats&eliminate a few things here&there&then you got a Good Album.this is still a a Above Average set though nevertheless.Lil Wayne finally getting His shine on."
5,ALWAYS 5 Stars - Weezy on his Game,"Weezy always top of the tha Game - also check out Smoke Sessions, Vol. 1- from his homie Devin the Dude another 5 Stars."
4,Lil Weezy got my respect,"This is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, southern Albums I've ever heard. Hell... this is one of the greatest albums... This definately makes my top 20 albums (Might make top 10), which consists of legends like Big, Pac, nas, jay, and Em. Honestly... When I listened to this album, I thought ""Lil' Wayne made this album?! Get outa here!"" He was one of the last rappers alive that I'd expect to put out an album so gritty, so emotional, so real! When I heard the first track ""Tha Mobb"", I thought ""Oh this must be the best track... I bet the rest are garbage..."" No... All his tracks are decent enough for me to respect. From Tha Mobb to Fly Out, this album is impressive. Let's hope Weezy F'in Baby has a lot more to offer us."
2,Come on Wayne,"Lil wayne Sucks now that man use to be so hard Listen to stuff like da block is hot, lights out, Hot Boys Old Cds. Lil Wayne was Real he green. He got like 3 hard songs on this carter 2 junk."
3,I've Heard Better From Lil Wayne,Man this CD aint really what I expected it to be but it is still hot dont get me wrong. I just think or better yet I know Wayne coulda done better man. but if you are a true Lil Wayne fan than this CD is a must have. Go buy it.
2,Tha Carter was is better but nice follow up,"Tha Carter 2 sounds more like a mixtape than a cd, but it is still a nice cd. Tha Carter is still better because on this cd with the exeption of a couple of songs, there is no subject or direction to the cd. Tha Carter 2 has alot of random punchlines in it. Wayne still spits fire but it would be better if he kept on subject or had direction to his flow. Still top 10 cd's of ""05"""
4,Acts Like He's Greatest Person Alive,He talks too much about how great he is. He raps the same in everysong. Actually 3.5.
4,LIL WAYNE IS A BEAST!!!!!!!!,"I HONESTLY DIDNT LIKE LIL WAYNE BEFORE THIS ALBUM, BUT THIS ALBUM HE PROVES THAT HE CAN SPIT. HIS LYRICS HAVE DEFINITELY IMPROVED A WHOLE BUNCH SINCE HIS EARLIER YEARS WITH CA$H MONEY. EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ALBUM MAKES IT A HOTT ALBUM. THE BEATS, FLOWS, CONCEPTS, AND LYRICS. NOW LIL WAYNE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MC'S NOT JUST CUZ OF THIS ALBUM, BUT ALSO CUZ OF HIS LATEST MIXTAPES."
1,No content what so ever. He said nothing the whole album,"This CD was horrible. He said nothing, there was no content, he talked about nothing the whole CD. The hooks were terrible ""best rapper alive"", ""dboy"", ect. I was so excited to get this because Tha Carter was such a good album...but this was terrile. He might want to call up Gillie The Kid to pencil down some more lyrics for him, and Manny Fresh to make him some beats cuz apparently they made Tha Carter what it was...not Wayne"
3,this album aint all that,"this album aint all that, but i see you lil' wayne lovers dun hopped on the bandwagon already, this cd is worth a 3 out of 5 stars, because lil' wayne flow is soo abc 123 sometimes, elementary, some of the sh*t he be sayin dont make since and it have me lookin like... wtf? but anyway, i wouldnt recommend this to no-one because im on B.G.'s side of the beef... a real n*gga"
5,Great Album,"Just to let you know, this CD was a big dissappointment to me. Like he said in one of his songs on the carter that he has everyone waiting on his sequel. I was waiting for something hot but it not. This album is weak. It sounds like one of his mix tapes he put out with young money ent. Mannie needs to help yo boy out by producing all the tracks on this album and it might be hot. I'm a big wayne fan but dude fell off on this one. He needs mannie badly.I changed my mind after months of listen to this album. He changed his style for the better."
1,don't waste your monry,buy a better airplane - hobbyzone super cub is what we bought after this failure
4,This is hot shit,Look...it's simple...if you like this period of electric miles you'll dig this cd.Bass is bottom end thorough. Bang on Miles!Enjoy it and weep.
5,Excellent Resource for Intermediate Photoshop Users,"This is one of the best general-purpose resources for photographers who are intermediate Photoshop users. Every aspect of Photoshop is covered, and there are lots of great tips and tricks, including many that I have never seen anywhere else."
5,Great Potoshop book,I really enjoy this book as it gave me lots of ideas and step by step how to achieve the result I'm looking for.
5,Great for beginning and intermeadiate users.,This book gives refreshing new ideas to use on photos. It is great for beginners and intermediate users. Goes through all the steps of how to get the effects you see on the page. The accompanying CD provides the pictures for you to follow along. Many worthwhile and useful effects to enhance photos. A book worth investing in.
4,CS-only operations should be clearly tagged,"The book in general is excellent, from its uncluttered, profusely illustrated layout to its nifty approach to potentially esoteric topics like profiles. Frankly, however, I was initially bummed out by its diving right into the RAW format topic as if it assumed that the reader had already either (1) purchased the Camera Raw plug-in for PS7 or (2) upgraded to CS, neither of which assumptions covered me. So I wasted half a day trying to find the plug-in, only to learn that it's available only for ""non-English"" versions of PS. Fortunately, I have a cousin who's more savvy in these matters and who advised me that there's a very good upgrade to the RAW program that came with the Canon Rebel I recently purchased."
2,Nothing new,"I give this two stars instead of one because it's not a bad book. The problem is that's it's the same old thing rehashed once again. There really wasn't anything that I haven't already read about in other books.If you've read the Photoshop Wow book, definitely don't waste your time, there's nothing new here. I was done with this expensive book in about 30 minutes. I'm no pro, but I guess I'm too advanced for this book."
4,Perfect for Photoshop lovers,This book by Jack Davis is perfect for those PhotoShop lovers that want to follow along with different tools. Many more advanced tools are used in this book.
4,Photoshop for Photography,Good book for describing how to perform detailed steps using Photoshop CS to enhance photographic images. Recommended for those individuals beginning/intermediate photographers interested in taking digital SLR images and making them better using Photoshop CS program.
3,OK shirt for the money,"Very high quality fabric, decent construction, sleeves way too short for size ordered. Amazon does not show the hideous ""BB"" logo embroidered onto the cuff - returning it would not have been cost effective, had sleeves shortened - though this lessens the value of the shirt since it can really only be used for casual wear. Still, really nice fabric - wish Amazon would be more forthcoming with details on specific size data and garment details."
2,"Nice Heifetz Collection, Poor digital recording",Nice collection of violin pieces by Heifetz.I wish they had used some filtering method while transfering Original Mono Recording into digital music in order to reduce/eliminate the background noise.
3,"Decent book, but too many types of animals","I was looking for ideas to feature dogs & cats and more than half the page layouts in this book concerned farm animals, wild animals, zoo animals etc. I felt the topic should have been one or the other because I felt there weren't enough dog pages.The layouts gave me a few ideas, but not as much creativity as I was hoping for. I saw some magazine layout ideas for pages about dogs that I liked more that inspired me to buy this book."
2,Not very creative,"You get better ideas from scrapbooking magazines. This book is very plain, not really creative.If you're trying to get new ideas or techniques, never buy this book!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm trying to sell mine!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,great idea book!!,"There are tons of layout ideas in this book. If you love animals, I recommend you get it. Table of contents are:1 Dogs2 Cats3 Horses4 Birds5 Small Animals6 Farm Animals7 Zoo & Animal Parks8 In The WildThere is 56 pages with 2 layouts per page. Many QUOTES are scattered threwout the book to use on your own pages. I just love this wonderful book. If you scrapbook your pets or any animals, I recommend this."
4,Fun toy for babies and a nostlagic toy for toddlers,"I bought these books for my baby boy when he was just born. I used to sing along to him since he was a few weeks old. These were his companions when he first lay on his stomach and he enjoyed grasping them and chewing them when he was a few months old. Now at 2 years, he sees his nephew play with them and still likes to press the circles and describe to mom what he sees. Very durable."
3,"Baby loves the music, book not so much",I bought these for my baby. He is now 15 months. He loves the music and singing. He is not really interested in the book. He can now push the buttons himself to make them play. I don't think it was worth the money just for the music part.
3,"""Driven from the streets by Government interference?""","A previous reviewer talks of the Comus crewe being driven from the streets by ""government interference."" He couldn't be referring to the decision not to allow the continuance of racially segregated crewe activities on New Orlean streets by any chance? Or could he? Language is a funny thing. This book is a dedication to the ""golden age"" when Mardi Gras was all white, and all was right with the ""white"" world. It is not a very liberating experience, but I guess as long as the vestiges of the ""old generation"" remain the nostalgia for the good old days will persist. After all, there are those who think we would have been better off had Strom Thurmond been president...."
1,Gordon loses his touch and fails to sparkle!,"Bob Gordon has been stealing other people's ideas for some time now, and his latest book is no exception! His ploy is to get others to do all the hard work, then step in and take the credit. He works at Make Believe Ideas in Berkhamsted and came in by the back door, sliming his way up the greasy pole of the publishing world. Don't believe him, he is a charlatan!"
1,Blows chunks on the Second Amendment,"350+ pages ... and devotes only two pages to the Second Amendment.And then pushes the Victim Disarmament bigots' view that the word ""people"" means state, but only in this sentence in the entire constitution.And then tries to justify this serious error by regurgitating Bradyite misinformation, as well as misquoting US vs. Miller.Give this one a miss."
4,Helpful Guide to Civil Liberties,I used this guide for high school students so they could find out how the Bill of Rights works in the real world! (At least in the US)
5,More than a gun book,"I just finished re-reading War Baby and I can attest that Larry Ruth did a bang up job on presenting a great amount of data. While the specifics on parts identification is there for collectors, and many diagrams of differences between manufacturers is helpful to the committed carbine nut, the greatest strength of this work is the painstaking research done to give a solid appreciation of what our country was like during WWII and to identify and honor the industrialists who overcame almost unbelieveable odds to get this rifle into the hands of troops. Each manufacturer has a section with tidbits and trivia about their successes and failures. The heroics of the employees of these various companies is highlighted and credit is given to shop foremen, designers, ordnance officials, and the average worker who made the whole system work. This is a fascinating historical work even if you're not interested in the carbine. It's expensive but you'll not be sorry."
4,Excellent Highlights From Three World Cups,"Making a highlight film for the 82, 86 and 90 World Cup should be easy, just compile all the excellent footages and let the action speaks for itself. Which is exactly what this video does!It categorizes the action into wing plays, individual skill, goal poaching, freekicks, etc; which is a nice touch. It is relatively long compared to other soccer videos and doesn't rush things or unnecessarily prolong the process with too much replay. The music is weak and the narration borders on lecturing, but who cares. The soccer is good."
3,"Not as Organized or fully researched as ""The Bru Book"" or ""The Jumeau Book"" but still a valuable resource.","Not as organized or fully researched as ""The Bru Book"" or ""The Jumeau Book"" by Francois Theimer but still a valuable resource on Steiner Dolls.This book kind of 'hops' about and does not give a clear chronological order of the dolls but the documentation about the various types of Steiner dolls is there if you know where to look.I hope future revisions of this book by the author are better organized by timeline so as to be clearer for the serious researcher."
3,Ok but not great,"This book was an ok version of the story of Goldilocks and the 3 Bears, but the little girl had such a bad attitude that I didn't read it to my 8 year old and didn't even want to give it away because of that."
3,Covers a wide range of topics,"This is a good introductory books that should lead to further investigation on all the topics treated, such as:-Materialism-Science,-God,-Philosophy,-Bible (archaeological evidence...etc)The authors are real scholars holding at least one university degree.I recommend it as an introduction to all those subject. The resources given at the end should lead the investigator further."
3,Painted Helmets,"It's OK! However, the print is to small, hard to read. Needs more color photos. Color photos of WWI painted helmets are OK. Needs more examples of WWII painted helmets."
3,It was Ok,"I got this for my 3 year old son and he loved it at first. The first few days he would sit there for an hour and ""play"" his game. After that he had quickly mastered all the activities and it got boring. I wish there more activities for him to do with it but that's where it is significantly lacking."
2,not that great,I got this for my daughter for her second birthday. She was not too interested in it. She played with it for a bit and then was done. she has others that she likes a lot more.
1,"ufo,s weakest album.","making contact and misdemeanor in my opinion were two of ufo,s weakest albums albums ever.i personally favor the schenker and chapman era ufo line ups,after ufo,s mechanix tour when pete way left the group ufo relly began a downward slide.i am still a fan of ufo to this day.i love all their albums from phenomenon thru and including wild willing and the innocent..and some of the mechanix album i saw ufo on this tour and they were good. i think the next decent album ufo made after mechanix was walk on water. i would personally avoid making contact and misdemeanor."
3,UFO give AOR a shot!,"Pretty good album but was hoping it would have a few more classic mid-80's gems on here but 'One Heart' and 'This Time' are stand out tracks. It would have to be UFO's most AOR sounding record with the glossy production, keyboards high in the mix and shred with new axe man Atomic Tommy M who is quite flashy but melodic and Phil Mogg delivers execellent vocals and lyrics as always.If you're a big 80's AOR/melodic rock fan this is definately worth checking out and the Chrysalis re-master is a really great package with lots of liner notes and pictures @ a pretty sweet price. Check out their next mini-album ""Ain't Misbehavin'"" there is some magic and great tracks on there too! I'm a huge UFO fan so I'm trying to get all their records especially the 80's Paul Chapman era."
4,Adds New Life,"This remaster adds new life to this disc. I had the original release on CD. I'm listening to this as I type this review. of course, I haven't completed listening to the whole disc, but what I hear sounds absolutely incredible. The remastering was done very well. Everything has a sort of 'ooomph' to it. The lows come out and hit you.Well done."
5,she who dares wins,"Renee could have been forgiven for trying to replicate her last studio album as it gave her her best selling album for many, many years. However, anyone who is expecting Tenderland Part Two is in for a (fantastic) surprise. Where Tenderland was a tribute to some old favorites and inspirations, Tonight looks defiantly into new territory. It melds her magnificent vocals with interesting and unexpected arrangements that rather than distract from the beauty of her voice, cast a different light on the fantastic musical instrument that it is. With wonderful string arrangements (It Takes a Woman, Cry One More Time) that hark back to 60s Dusty Springfield or Burt Bacharach to the mariachi horns on Paul Kelly's Gutless Wonder to the pounding stomp on I'm Evil Tonight, this album recognises its roots and totally reshapes them into 21st century soul. My personal fave at this stage is probably the beautifully stark He Loves Me Not, but on Tonight every one is a winner."
3,Book,"It's been soon long since i had this book and my first review of it. I actually got this book, because we had to get it for class, the instructor was the author of this book. It's a very interesting read. i highly recommond it."
4,An dense account of a critical period in NYSE history,"A very dense account of the NYSE's evolution leading up to the fall of fixed commissions. It describes the strategies the NYSE and it's members used to (successfully) avoid change and regulatory pressure for a many years. Welles was a bit early in predicting it's demise, and he describes the rise of institutional trading (and decline of retail) in oddly pessimistic terms, but those involved in the exchange business and/or regulation will likely enjoy much here. Probably not easily followed by those outside of the industry."
2,Tedious,"A long-winded contemporary account of Wall Street commissions in 1975. Pass. One interesting piece of trivia is a quote from a then 32-year old Michael Bloomberg who was then a trader at Salomon Brothers, talking about block trading and competing with ""Goldie"" (Goldman Sachs). Somehow the book is stuck in the world of 1975 and frankly quite pessimistic. Wall Street's biggest days were still ahead."
4,Better Images,"The product satisfies my expectatives however images are not enough detailed, it is necessary real pictures and not shape images about products, it was, probably I had bought another product with look and feel better for me"
2,Bulova Marine Star Watch,"This watch does not hold time corectly,it keeps going ahead by 3mins in a 2 day period. I will keep my Casio G-Shock Solar over this watch. I am very disappointed with Bulova they been around since 1875."
4,Good watch,"The time precision is good. I haven't meet any problem, after 2 monthes of using it.This watch is beautiful. I like wearing it. Be aware that the case is 40.7 mm of diameter.Although my skin is very sensitive, the stainless case and bracelet don't hurt me. Bracelet closes well, and there is no risk of loosing the watch.Finition could be better, as the hand of seconds doesn't meet the marks of seconds : it meets the ""half seconds"", in the middle of the marks. This is a typical offset mistake of chinese manufacturing!The quality/price rate is good.Shipping, price, and delays by Amazon, from USA to France, were excellent. Thanks"
2,Roots of Ehhh,"I've taken Philosophy classes before and I find that the curriculum that accompanies Roots of Wisdom to be rather dry. I don't think Mitchell's insight offers much. Philosophy isn't dull, but ROW doesn't make it exciting. The text is required, so I bought it. Usually I'd keep a book like this for the library, but I will more than likely sell this one back to the book store when the semester is over."
3,Roots of Wisdom-good,The book is in tact with no rips in the pages. The only con is that it has many marks of highlighting and underlining on the pages
4,"Honestly, unless you REALLY want the real thing get this","I got this in a few days after ordering it so it got to me REALLY fast. Shipping was a breeze. It may not be an ""actual"" item, however there are almost no problems with it. The disks have nice art on them, and the box itself it a little bit uglier than the nice box sets however its a nice DVD box and such. The languages are English and Japanese with good subtitles. So far, after watching it (and yes, I HAVE seen the actual episodes as well so I can compare the two) the only thing that gives it away as lower quality is a little shaking during the panning shots. This does not happen often and it has not detracted from the anime so far. With this becoming a harder to find anime I say get this unless your uptight about perfect quality. This is a really cheap and worthwhile alternative."
1,Bootleg,"I'll admit that I didn't order this specific item, but it looks very much like a bootleg to me. Anime series are never released with 10 episodes to a disc except by bootleggers. Don't fall for it; go with the ""Anime Legends Complete Collection"" instead. For the same price, you get only half the series, but the difference in quality and having a legitimate copy are worth it._Wolf's Rain_ itself, of course, is an excellent show that I highly reccomend."
5,"Sketchy Item, but Great for the Price","The product is a little sketchy, I just bought it online the other day and watched several parts today to make sure it was good quality. The packaging is top-notch, the 3-DVD setup is a little sketchy, the menus aren't supper high quality, you don't get the ability to skip through parts of an episode (each ""chapter"" on the disc is the next episode) but...I watched it and it looked like fine quality. Now that being said, I have a 140"" hi-definition projector so if this thing was poor quality I would be able to tell. Is it identical quality to the other versions (typical is 4 episodes per disc) I can't say, but I watched the entire series on those a couple weeks back and can't tell a difference.So my verdict- if you want to save a lot of money and get a good quality version of his incredible series... this is a fine product. If you are nit-picky about things like menus, shell out the extra dough and buy the 100% legit ones sold as two volumes."
3,Good for use within 1 mile,"I purchased this 2-way basically for fun. We have used them in our cars to see how far the range would reach and are disappointed to say that the 3 mile range is not at all realistic if you live around any buildings. If you have a large field or are out on a boat the range is a little closer to 3 miles, but not quite. This is a 2-way for the mall or a festival. A definite plus is the ease of use. The buttons and instruction book are simple and it took us approximately 5 minutes to learn most functions. The belt clip is a nice accessory but is a pain when trying to put the antenna up and down because you have to remove it from the case each time. It weighs the same as the 4 AAA batteries it requires and is smaller than some cellular phones."
1,buy and break-loose money,"this item has a feel of substance but it as the product is misleading. it appears it is made from pot metal, which is fragile. our broke on the arms rendering the item usless. thus we wasted our money. it broke under normal use, and even infrequent use. i do not like buying things that really are badly made and break when they should not...."
3,One in one,"The feeder is well constructed and easy to hang with an S hook. However, it was missing the ""legs"" to support it on the ground. They could have dropped out of the box, which was completely crushed, thanks to UPS stacking it under heavier items."
4,Super product!,This is really a useful design and very versatile. The folding feet keep it up off the ground when used as a ground feeder but can be folded up to use as a hanging feeder or even pole-mounted with the included pole-top support. My only (slight) criticism would be that it's not quite as smoothly finished as it could be -- a few slivers on corners. But it will really get the use this winter!
5,Great,"Used it up in the mountains (washakie wilderness) with lots of trees to interfer however that was not a problem, it had better then a two mile range, Once I was in the creek bottom and was able to talk to the others at camp a good 3 miles a way and the camp was surrounded by trees"
1,Not real good range,I have used both Motorolla and VTEC. And the COBORA had the worst range of all brands. Very staticy at even 100 yards.
4,Canadian eh!,"This is a great soundtrack. It features some of the great talent that Canada has to offer, with bands such as Jakelope, Sam Roberts, and Junior Achiever. The disc feature an array of styles that will meet the needs of any teen age rocker. Kicking off appropriately with the Degrassi them song followed by the great indie rockers Tuuli, the disc takes emotional ups and downs bridging with Sam roberts and closing with an extended version of Jakalope's theme song. One of the tracks that stands above the rest and is worth buying the soundtrack for is Junior Achiever's ""Suburbs"". This is an athem for the middle class American that is stuck in their suburbenite existance at the helm of their parents. It provides great emotional release and finds itself perfectly placed in the #8 slot. This is the best soundtrack to spawn from Canadian television in years!"
2,Not what I expected.,I really thought they would have some of the songs from the bands in the show. If you are looking for those songs DO NOT BUY this CD. You get a couple of those songs on the bonus which can only be played on your computer so they can not be downloaded. If I had only known this I would not have bought this. But if you are not looking for those songs then this is a pretty good CD.
3,not what i'd hoped,"this book contained beautiful sketches, but the sketches were of multiple failed (for many reasons) projects. if you are looking for lists of what to do, or what not to do, this is not the book for you. i'm still interested in the concept, but will need to buy other books."
2,hard to read,"As others have pointed out none of the plans shown in the book seem to have been built. Every single one looks to have been cancelled because of budget problems. Which makes you wonder, if people with enough money to go to a professional architect find an earth-sheltered house too expensive to build, what hope do the rest of us have of building one in our lifetimes? Lots of interesting ideas but not much practical application that I can see.However my biggest gripe is the font used in the book: a script font that is an attempt to make the book look like a hand written journal. I just found it very hard to read large amount of text with that font. They should have stuck with a normal typeface instead of trying to get cute.Hard to recommend unless you can handle the typeface and don't mind that the book has no real practical information. (Although lots of interesting IDEAS.)"
1,Try Before You Buy,"If you are interested in building an earth-shelter/underground home look elsewhere. This is not the book for you. I found nothing really compelling in this book and regret buying it. If you live in an area with hot summers, cold winters and no fire ants then I suggest buying ""The Complete Book of Underground Houses"" by, no kidding, Rob Roy. Rob claims that you can build the structure of a 40'x40' house for around 10,000 dollars. I learned from Rob that my area is probably not prime for an underground house because with the blazingly hot summers and very mild winters I won't be able to store up enough ""capacitance"" in the soil to give me extra ""cooleth"" in the summer, the time I really need it. Still, Rob Roy's book was very informative and I'm glad I bought it."
3,An easy read with some good historical detail,"This is a light read with a VERY loose sci/fi time travel framework. The details of Roman life were what got me to stick with it. Overall, enjoyable..."
3,slave finds romance,"I had high hopes for this book.I loved all the historical facts but the story got lost in the romance and became hard to believe. I found ""Household Gods""Household Godscharacters more believable and entertaining."
4,This author shows talent!,"Miranda finds herself stranded in Pompei when her time travel experiment goes wrong and her homing beacon does not work. Suddenly, a woman from the twenty first century is stuck in the first century, and rather than being a respected scientist, she is now a slave.Yet, Miranda is not a pessimist; she looks upon this as an opportunity to learn about the ancient world in a whole new light. Servants frequently know more about the real world than their masters, so this is a real learning experience. Using her knowledge of the future and folklore, she makes a place for hereself and even manages to find a new family, and love.**** Fans of Diana Galbandon will find this a real treat. Miranda is a spunky, determined young lady. With well researched detail, Ms. East both educates and entertains. Hopefully, we can look for more in the near future from this talented lady.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
1,Sorely tempted to toss it against the wall,"While the concept for the story was intriguing it fell flat in execution. Ms. East seems to have forsaken the novelists' creed ""show don't tell."" Perhaps the author couldn't decide if she were writing a romance novel or a history text. Dialog is almost non-existent. Most of the book is a simple recitation of events. There are quite a few instances of unwieldily repetition. A good editor might have repaired the poor proofreading and kept the story concept on track. In spite of the depth of research, this one is a candidate for the wall-banger hall of fame."
4,sweet romance,the story was unique and an interesting approach to historical fiction. miranda was an interesting hero and her choices and the ending of the novel were pleasantly suprising!
2,Michael Grant is more interesting,"It's no wonder this book is through a vanity press. It reads like a text for Classics 101. If the characters were more real and the Miranda weren't so repetitious in what she had to say, it might have been more interesting. (...) Not everyone is a classicist but please. . .This book needs a good editor and an injection of style. There were so many points I felt like I was reading a term paper I was going to quit reading. Or it was like I was reading a bad splice of Pliny's letters,Cena Trimalchionis, and my text from my Roman Law class a couple of semesters back.Though I will say that this author did her homework. At least her facts were for the most part accurate if the story was a little less than interesting."
2,Good research with needless repetition!,"I bought this book for my kindle because I love stories set in the 1st Century AD. The writer showed promise with her research but so much of it was repeated throughout the book and on my kindle, sometimes I thought I was reading the same chapter or page! I don't know how many times the main character repeatedly described her relationship with Demetres, or the fact that Roman's left food scrapes on the floor after dinner, or what knucklebones were, or how unattractive she was, or (blah blah blah), or how she loved teaching stories to Tullia--not to mention the telling of the stories themselves! I wanted to scream in some parts: ""OKAY, we got it already!""This story was under 300 pages but could have been condensed to 150 pages with a good editor. Good first book and the writer is a good story teller overall."
3,Cute story but Predicable,"I really liked the story line it was a cute story but predicable. Ms. East did a lot of research. She often repeated herself.I think this book is good for older teens, I believe it is not for young teens due to the suggestion of sexual content."
1,Wish I had read the other negative review before buying.,"For composite video I'm sure this cable works just fine. However, as was previously mentioned by another reviewer, this cable is junk for s-video. After disassembling the cable, I discovered that the Luma was connected to pin 9 instead of pin 7. The end result is diagonal black lines streaking across the screen.It is possible to correct, but time consuming, annoying, and I would imagine extremely difficult for those without soldering experience.My advice to those looking for s-video output: Skip all of these s-video/composite cables and buy a dedicated s-video cable to avoid this ridiculous design error."
5,Does what it's supposed to,"The chord hooked up like it's supposed to, seems to be made well enough, now I can revisit my Super Nintendo childhood memories."
5,Worked For Me,It seems some others have had problems with this cord but it worked fine for me using the composite cables for my recently re-discovered Super Nintendo. The people at Quick Buys seem nice as well.
4,Nice Bike,Bought this mountain bike for my son and he has really enjoyed it. It has some upgraded features that I couldn't find on other bikes without paying 2 times the amount. Very quick shipping too!
3,Damaged bike with a dent and shifters dont work,"Got this bike. Was excited initially. But then after assembly, I found that the chain would rub against the cage except for one combination of gears. Not sure what should I do. Take it to a dealer and get it fixed but should not be needing to do that on a brand new bike.Also bike had a big dent when it arrived even though package was intact. I would stick to Schwinn and other ""real"" bicycle manufacturers!"
1,Poor Materials in this Bike,We bought this bike for my daughter based on the Columbia name. What a mistake. The materials used in this bike are really poor quality. On our first venture the derailer cracked forcing the device in to the spokes. We got it fixed. On the next venture the pedal rail bent from just laying the bike on it's side. Now the bike won't work at all. Clearly there is punk metal used in critical components making this bike unfit and unsafe for kids. I am so disappointed in this bike. I am really apprehensive to even get it repaired again because who knows what critical part will fail next. Save your money and buy something else. The materials used in this bike are so poor quality we on got about 5 miles of riding on this bike. Now it is junk.
1,Mountain bike must be kept indoors,When I first got this bike I could not of been happier. I have had it for 4 months now and I am seeing rust in the chain and some of the screws which are rusting out. I am afraid to open the crank shaft... it is making grinding and crunching noises and I have a feeling the bearings are rusting out too. I do live in the Northwest and see alot of rain but for crying out loud... this is a mountain bike. My last bike was a schwinn and I owned it for over ten years and never saw rust. This bike has all the bells and whistles but where it counts... they used cheap parts that are not reliable. Don't waste your money.
3,Assembly definately required...,"I haven't really had a chance to RIDE this bike yet. But I should mention that the assembly process is not very straightforward unless you already know how disc brakes/etc work. I managed to get everything in place, but my brakes are still stiff, I assume this is some minor adjustment somewhere, but one wouldn't be able to tell this from the instruction manual..."
3,bike,Difficult to assemble. Looks really good mine came with three deep scratches on the frame. Good deal for the price if you know how to build bikes.
3,Great bike for the price. You just need to assemble.,The assembly directions were not very helpful. I took me a couple tries to get the front wheel together. My front brake still rubs from the assmebly.
4,Columbia Trailhead Disc Men's Mountain Bike,Beauty bike but package arrived open and was missing assembly instructions and a quick release bolt for the front wheel. Still too cold and snowy to take it for a spin.
4,The Rest of The Story,"A wonderful book; unfortunately the publisher doesn't tell anything about the authors. Charles Hurlburt was a founder of Africa Inland Mission in the 1890's, and was responsible for missionaries first being allowed by the Belgian government into Congo. He left a huge legacy in Africa, including children and grandchildren who have served God in Africa."
3,thanks for the book,dearseller this book was in bad condition the cover of it was indeeed rippedwitch should have not been you did not take care of your books like I do whenI buy my bookslove carolineboudle
5,The Power of Limits,I love this book. I am a visual artist and this book is really helpful for developing the imagery that I like to use.
2,It didn't answer my question.,"I wanted to learn about applying the principles to furniture placement, but it didn't shed light on the subject for me."
3,Acceptable,Alittle delayed but accepttable .It better arrive on time that force out of the thinking of mising the book .
3,"Interesting, Helpful, Fuzzy","While I agree with the other reviewers that this book is both well written & well illustrated, the Jungian cant of the author feels too new-agey to me. Proportion is indeed present in the world, but to assign proprtion to EVERYTHING is an over-generalization, and to ascribe a metaphysical meaning to it based on this over-generalization is a bit much. Useful for the illustrations of proportion, a thing every designer ought to know, but when it wanders off into the woods it looses me."
3,The Power of LImits,"I bought this book when it first appeared in 1981, and lent it to a student who didn't return it. Reading it thirty years later it is a bit disappointing. The superimposition of the Golden Mean on natural forms is not convincing, and the main point about creativity emerging from the limits of form, or what the permaculturists call the Edge is not convincingly made either, though I think it is true. But there are some wonderful images, just that there are better books on the use of Sacred Geometry in architecture around these days, and some fantastic u-tube clips. A pioneer book which was probably formative, but has been surpassed for clarity.The Power of Limits: Proportional Harmonies in Nature, Art, and Architecture (Shambhala Pocket Classics)"
3,Magical love story,"I always like a touch of magic with my love stories. Love is a magical feeling and this book delivers nicely. It does help to have read some of Marilyn Pappano's earlier series, otherwise you may find that the character identification moves too quickly in the beginning (particularly for the secondary characters). I take away one star for this issue. The lack of story depth lost it one more star. However, having said that, I enjoyed this book as a nice simple lift from everyday life. A bit of mind candy for a trying day.Many of us know someone who has sacrificed their personal life for their work or who believes that marriage will never be for them again. Here is a chance to meet two people who learn how to make up for lost time. With a quick wish, Holly gets more than she bargains for in Tom. A quick fun read, a great beach, bathtub or any other time for ""relaxing without stress"" book."
3,Finish this series!,"I love this author and buy every book she publishes but she's in a rut with this ""Bethlehem series"". Enough already! Pappano is a a master with character development and I look forward to some fresh plots and new blood."
5,The Ghost,I have this album and I cannot stop listening to it every song is just banging. Styles really brought his game on this album and I am glad because he is one of my favorite rappers in the game. Favorite songs are all of them and that is the truth no bulls**t. If you get a chance to get this album then waste no time buy this album you will be glad you did because The Ghost is a true gangsta and not bubblegum rap. Recommend this to all rap fans. HOLLA!
3,This one's a little bit more laid back,"I was really looking for that fire hot violent side of P to come out like it does on his mixtapes and LOX projects. If you are driving long distance, listen to this album. He brings a lot of different introspect about the game and life in general."
3,A Bunch of Throwaways,"Any real L.O.X. fan will tell you, this is album could've been better, Delays hurt this, half of the album sounds like shit that wouldn't make the album (if you know what I mean), G-Joint sets this off and leaves you wanting more and you're not gonna get that, Styles P weakest effort."
4,I liked it better than the first couple.,"This book was really good in my opinion. I do not think I could give it 5 stars however because I do not find the writing that good or the plot to be very surprising. I, unlike others, do not heavily bash writing that is sometimes predictable. Sometimes characters actually act in rational ways so when they do there should not be surprises. However I am a history buff and like the unique parallels to the real world infused into the book. I think it is a pretty unique story and am thouroughly enjoying the series. One thing I would like to see though is someone using a bow and arrow which would probably be a far superior weapon to these slow constantly lit arquebusses."
4,I like it but DUDS aaaggghhh...,"These are great the best I have played with. I have encountered about 3 or 4 duds, but no problem. However, I am trying the new reed Rue Lepic by Vandoren ""hope it's good."""
3,2E D&D DM Tool Totally Tubular!,"With the collection of 2E books and mapmaker, it's a great tool for the 2E D&D Dungeon Master if a computer is available."
5,The Only Texas Cookbook,"I had borrowed the book from my sister and found it to be just wonderful!! Being a Native Texan, I am always on the look-out for recipes that are ""Texas"". The recipes for Duck Gumbo, Crawfish Etouffee andFuzzy's Fantastic South Texas Road Meat Chili are among my favorite from the book. My sister is demanding her copy back, so, I am ordering my own!!"
5,Clever Former Texan Cooks up some powerful stories & suppers,"I keep buying and giving copies of The ONLY Texas Cookbook...starting with my daughters-in-law who want some of my favorite recipes. But you don't have to be a cook to hunker down with this powerful book of classic Texas tales you'll never forget because Linda's voice rings so true. It is an oldie but goodie! ~ Shirley (Shirleybarr PR, Houston)"
4,Great Cookbook!,"This cookbook was a great addition to my collection, a lot of the recipes we old family recipes that I didn't have on paper."
5,AN excellent book for studying the ICHING the best one!!,"Im sorry michael but maybe you have no background of the I ching calculations. The problems with the pages you mention are that, they were dividing the numbers according to the number and has a remainder. It is impossible for you to calculate the I ching in decimals. As i have some feng shui background and i ching masters to assist me it is the way of calculating. I wish i could contact you but some how amazon does not let me. Well hopefully they send this to you and remove your post because it is nonsense.This book is the best book out there for learning the I ching. It gives you three methods of prediction. No other book has this. It has broaden my understanding it and has helped me throughout. I deeply recommend it. 100% guarantee. I pity the author and for the people who have read the review before mine. It will discourage you but ill tell you if you dont know how to calculate the number you can always email me howe_85@yahoo.co.uk"
3,Belkin pre-N 802.11 review,"This card just only picks up signals well in the open area. If you got a brigde wall, the signals easily gets block, fade or never get picked up at all.Besides, the card is too hot, you could feel the heat around the area if you stay online more than one hour. Generally, the card works fine but with a condition that you need to download the latest driver version from Belkin web site. Hoped this help.RegardsKC"
2,Beware - not Mac compatible!,"Although Belkin's Pre-N Router is Mac-compatible, this corresponding PC Card Adapter works only for Windows users. This fact is not apparent in Amazon's product description and is unclear even on Belkin's own web site. I purchased two cards and only then saw they do not work on Macs. When I called Belkin to suggest they should make this compatibility information easier to locate on their website, I was greeted with unbelievable arrogance and a total lack of interest. If you use a PC, these cards may be very good, but as far as I am concerned, after experiencing their horrible customer service attitude, that's the last Belkin purchase for me."
1,hopeless,"First off, there is no cards slot for the iMac. My bad for not checking, but the product was touted as compatable with Apples.But for my PC, this and the Belkin Pre-N router I got, would not set up, ever. I'm not a computer guy, but I'm no dummy and I could not set this thing up. Technical support was worse than unhelpful. They knew less than I did and deflected reponsibility at every turn.The seller, Shopila, was also unresponsive at their ""customer support"" email and phone number. I tried four times at each avenue. I sent the cards back and hope to get my money back. If not, I don't know what my recourse will be."
4,I used this for 3 or 4 years with my 2004 sony lap top!!,"Work perfectly. I had an issue with the Belkin N Router and called Belkin (which has great support). Belkin tried to resolve and couldn't resolve the issue, so they sent me an RNA number. I sent the router back to Belkin after using it for 12 months and they shipped a brand new updated router to me. I couldn't believe how well these guys handled this.[...]."
4,Good,"I always buy Nature's Way Flax Oil 1000 Mg Softgels, 100-CountNature's Way as a supplement for my diet, i recommend it, it's pure fibre."
3,Scary Mannequins.,"The atmosphere was horrifying. There's a film grain on the screen at all times giving the game that antique look. I loved the music. It fit the look of the game. The only problem I had were the people I had to rescue. You have to escort them to safety and they don't always follow you. Plus, they hop around in an unrealistic fashion. Game physics does not apply here."
2,Don't waste your $ or time,"I read other reviews which were all mixed. I gave this game a chance. I really like the Resident evil series and really ejoyed ""Undying"". This game is no where near the quality or fun of either one of those. It has the potential if they would work on the graffics and the monsters. I played it for a couple of days hoping it would get better, but no such luck. I did think it was scary playng it but the graffics and the same old monsters made it terrible. I suggest you try ""Undying"" if you haven't and you like this type of first person shooter, puzzle solving game."
3,Turn off the lights and be prepared to be scared out of your pants,"This is a decent game, but I'll say right up front that it's difficult to control and if you get frustrated easily with getting killed in the game numerous times before you get the feel then this game isn't for you. Personally this is how I felt while playing it and went back to it a few times to get a better feel for it so that I could enjoy myself more.The game itself is all about the atmosphere. Set in a gothic castle, you'll find yourself looking behind yourself from time to time when you're not sure if it's a rat or some lumbering zombie that is making noise in the distance.The goal of the game is to save your relatives by leading them to a safe zone in the castle. An additional challenge is that you're faced with time limits to save different family members as you learn more about their fate. It appears to have a high replay value as the castle layout is regenerated for each new game."
3,Light on Substance,"The book is light on specifics, quite superficial,and not all that enlightening. I certainly would not recommend the book for an introduction to Wicca, and it is probably so simplistic that a practitioner would not find it of much use.Having said that, it does have some good references, bibliography, tables of correspondences, and dates to remember."
3,"Used 3 times, like it, came with dead battery","Watch arrived dead. Returned. What looks like the same watch came back working now. Could well be just the battery as the earlier reviewer suggests.I've used this watch with snowshoes, exercise bike and snow blowing the driveway. It splits the exercise time into 5 zones based on heart rate and tells you the time (and percent) spent in each zone. Very nice. Lets me compare the workout of the exercise bike (known load) to other activities (like shoveling the driveway)).edit Sept 2011: I switched to a watch/gps that does HR. I like it much better. Consider getting the Garmin forerunner 305 -- for $150 it can track wear you are, pace, heart rate, etc. and upload them to your computer so you can see historical data. Its the only HR monitor I've used for the past two years."
3,Dead Battery,"Like another reviewer, I ordered this back in Dec. '06 and when it arrived it had a dead battery. I didn't it know it at the time, so I sent it back to Amazon, and they sent another one-with an open box and another dead battery. I changed the battery myself, and also changed the battery in the sensor (not sure if it was dead, too, but just in case). As I just got it yesterday, I haven't had a real chance to play with all the bells and whistles, but it does seem like the instruction book was a bit hard to comprehend."
5,Olympus FE-300 memory card,"Brand new, in the original, unopened packaging, this memory card slid right into place and added more than 650 pictures to my Olympus FE-300 digital camera. This is awesome!"
1,Adorama does NOT have this M xd card,"This item has been ordered twice. Both times Adorama sent the M+ card instead of the M card. With the first order, I was told Amazon caused the problem. I waited about a month, called Adorama, but was placed on hold for over 10 minutes. Thinking the problem must have been resolved within that length of time, I ordered from Amazon again. When the M+ was sent again, more phone calls were made etc. This time I was told that Adorama does not have the M card only the M+, although Adorama's web site shows 2 Olympus M xd cards. It is unbelievable that this card is still for sale on Amazon's website after another month has rolled by!"
5,Good choice...,You can get cheaper 2 GB cards but if you want to use it for panoramic pictures with your Olympus 850 SW (and others in the Olympus series) you will need this one. It costs more than the others but technology has its price I guess.
5,Olympus xd M2gb,Olympus 202027 2GB M Type Xd Card (Retail Package)The price was good and the card is just fine for my needs
2,Olympus 2 Gb xD memory card,"I bought this card as a back up card for my E510, with the primary card being a 4 Gb CF card. Not recommended unless you use it as a backup card (like me) or your Olympus camera only takes xD cards. They are slow and small in capacity (2 Gb max). I must say that they are better than the Fuji xD H cards, though."
3,"Good price, but then they shank you on shipping!",I think $19.95 for this item was a reasonable price. But why $10 to ship? Please tell me why spending $0.41 USPS wouldn't have gotten it to me just as well?
4,camera chip for frame,Card was purchased for my mothers electronic photo frame in UK so far so good. I think she used it today. Had no problem downloading photos on it.I will know more later.
