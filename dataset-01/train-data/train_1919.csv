2,"OK Read, but serves better as a resource",The book is a views book that deals with five different ways that churches operate. Several of the methods of government have little to no Biblical basis. It seems that one or two can fit the Biblical pattern. It will help you to understand other people's views but probably not worth the read.
3,I can't rate it becaue I got it for my brother for XMAS 2007,I can tell you when my brother got it for Christmas he easily had it working when we were still opening presents. He travels a lot and I thought it would be great for him. I am unsure if he still uses it and how it worked.
5,The Rise of Charlie Drop,"I loved this book! My friend from England kept telling me to buy it but I never found it in the bookstores over here. She got mad and mailed it. (lol sorry Annie) ""The Rise of Charlie Drop"" was a very good book. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Rather flat and disappointing.,"I usually enjoy this author's books, but this one leaves me unmoved. Perhaps it's because I find the characters uninteresting. Or the plot rather uninvolving. But overall, it took me a long time to finish this book. Something's missing. It lacks... zing."
2,A mess,It's not a fabric backpack! You can't use outside if it is raining. No protection for the content and everything is visible. This is just for going to the beach.
1,The picture is decieving!,"I ordered the ""black"" bag and got a POS fish net bag. Then I sent an email, and never heard back. So i have this girlie fishnet bag that sucks.Don't be had, look elsewhere."
4,Camso 65501 boat winterization kit,"Good product except for one thing, there was a male plastic fitting that screwed into a female metal fitting. Well the plastic threads were just a little different and could not stand up to the metal. So make sure you use teflon tape or just get a metal male nipple, otherwise it was quick and easy. I did check at the block when done to make sure the pink stuff was there. Have a couple extra gallons of the antifreeze on hand unless your muffs are air tight,cause you will lose some antifrezze at the intake on the outdrive."
5,Wooden Blocks,I am very pleased with the Uncle Goose Wooden ABC Blocks. I wanted to buy a good set of blocks for my new grandson for Christmas. I had looked locally but could not find any that were the quality I wanted. I was very pleased when I found these on line. When I received them I was extremely happy with the quality and and workmanship of the blocks. They are also made in the USA!!!!!!!!!! I would recomment the blocks to anyone.
5,"Great Blocks, lots of fun - Don't step on them in the dark!","We got these for our 10 month old daughter. I am fairly sure as an engineer I have more fun playing with them then she does (I am always trying to defy gravity with complex towers) but its super rewarding when she quickly bashes them to the ground and giggles. Soon after we got these she has also made her own attempts to stack them - and I am sure this will improve with time. Compared to every other toy we have purchased I have no doubt these will stand the test of time - both in the ability to last many months (years) of playing and for future children. The blocks are durable, not too sharp and the text is not simply painted on - they are textured. I look forward to using them for spelling and counting once my daughter gets older. Highly recommend - but as the title says make sure you pick them up before you shut off the lights, it only takes one time of tripping over a pile of wooden blocks that you learn that lesson."
4,"Great set of blocks, with one small quibble","This is a nice set of wooden blocks, and our 17 month old daughter plays with them endlessly. She loves the pictures of animals on each block, and will bring blocks over and have us turn them around to all the faces, with us reading each letter or number, and naming each animal, and she is mesmerized.The one small quibble is that the description says that it features carved letters. This is partially true, but only two of the faces on each block have carved letters, the rest are flat and smooth with printed/painted letters or drawings. This isn't terrible, but based on the description I was expecting all the letters to be carved, and they are not.Still, a good set of blocks, and that is a minor quibble."
5,Excellent!!,"These blocks are great! They're larger than most blocks out there (easy grip for little hands), brightly colored, intricate designs (to keep a child's attention), and durable. The paint and raised designs are going to last, especially when compared to simple painted blocks you see at places like WalMart. My parents have had a set like this for years (for the grandkids visiting), and they're still like new--only their set came from Vermont Country Store and was more expensive. I was very happy to find an exact set for a cheaper price here on Amazon. My almost 1 year old plays with these daily; he's already stacking them, sometimes 3-4 blocks high. Excellent skill-building toy, hours of fun! You won't be disappointed."
4,Nice blocks,"These are very nice blocks. No sharp edges. Just the right size not too small like most blocks. Love that they came with a bag & don't mind paying a little extra for it. The only thing that could make these better is if all of the sides were nicely carved in. Only two of the letters on each block is, the others are just stamped. We love them & bought the lowercase set also. We plan to use the blocks when our little one comes to spell out the age each week & take weekly pictures.Lindenwood/Uncle Goose has great customer service if you loose a block, or one becomes damaged... the canvas bag we got had a small hole in the side & I called to buy a replacement ... they sent a new one, free of charge, no questions asked. Fabulous customer service!"
2,Dangerous for young kids,"I was very excited to get these blocks for my son since they're made of wood and non-toxic paint. However, when we got the blocks, I noticed that many tiny splinters coming off of them. They don't seem sharp enough to be a problem for hands, but for a kid who still puts everything in his mouth, that could be really dangerous! I chewed on one myself to see what would happen, and was able to easily dent/break some of the wood. I contacted the company and they had great customer service. They sent me a second set of blocks right away. Unfortunately, those blocks have the same problem.All in all, they are beautiful blocks and I plan to keep them for when my son is older. I think the wood they are made from is just too soft to be durable to tiny teeth. I bought a set of baby's first blocks from Haba which are perfect for him right now."
3,Doesn't work or look good.,"I ordered the Grey case, and it's really ugly plastic... Like really.Also, this cover interferes with the smartcover getting a good magnetic attachment to the iPad. 3/5 times the cover would fly right open.I'm sure this product will help some, but it really just makes using my iPad harder IMHO."
3,BoxWave iPad 2 Smart Sleeve (Gray),"Not what I was expecting. If you have a screen protector over your iPad it raises the edges. The color is really dull and the last corner is the toughest to put on. If you have the smart cover over it, the cut out for where the smart cover's magnetic attachment is about 1cm more so you don't have coverage in that area. But other than those, it protects the back well."
3,Growing on Us :-),"My daughter was not very enthusiastic about this book at first. She thought it was pretty gross. She liked the pages showing the different age groups and things that happen to your body at different stages, but was not too interested in the actual body parts themselves. Now, she looks at it every chance she gets. I think it a very good book to learn about the body and systems, but only when your child is ready."
3,Quantum's human body,"This is a fun and interesting book on the human body. It is limited in information, so it is more interesting to the 2nd grade to 4th grade set. I am really disapointed that LeapFrog has not produced more books for the quantum pad. I think the concept is great and it is perfect for travel."
1,Not what I saw in the Quantum Pad Sampler Book,"I got this book thinking it would fart just like in the sampler book that comes pakaged with the Quantum Pad. But, it dosn't do anything the sampler book does. All it does is get answers wrong!"
2,"A good start, but...","I am hoping that the author improves with age. I was intrigued after reading the first few pages, but that early enthusiasm quickly turned to frustration. The awkward wording, the same descriptions of the territory, the often predictable dialouge from the characters. My husband and I read this aloud to each other -- I would have stopped reading halfway through if it hadn't been for my dear spouse's attitude of: ""let's see this one through."" Hoping for better things next time around."
4,This is one damned fine book.,"Forget the fact that he is writing about his great grandfather. Forget the fact that there are traces of Cormac McCarthy in the prose. This is one damned fine book. It opens on the Custer massacre and follows the historic aftermath of 1876-77 -- a series of bungled attempts find and destroy the Sioux, Cheyenne and Nez Perce. There are scenic plains, alcoholic generals and straight out massacres, but described with such poetic prose that you feel yourself (as well as the subject matter) elevated. I only wish that the book was longer. Or that, instead of being his first novel, I could run back and check out what else he's written."
3,Blood and guts,"This is a disturbing and gut wrenching book to read about the atrocities of the US army to revenge the massacre of Custer and his troops. The description of the soldiers coming upon the bodies of Custer's troops is the most realistic and difficult to read description I have ever come across. The images stay with you as do those later when the misguided army mows down women, children, braves and 300 of their horses with gatling guns. Not a happy ending and perhaps not worth starting unless you have a tough stomach.John, author of Reading Thomas Merton"
3,If you can get past the stilted writing style...,"Huebner wrote this story in very vivid detail but at times it is very difficult to tell what is dialog and what is narration. Some of the scenes in this book are very graphic and bloody. So much so at some points, it seemed excessive. Huebner managed to avoid falling into cliches but did get repetetive in describing similar characters, scenes and events.Overall I really enjoyed this book but I wish it would have been a little easier to follow. Not quite a page turner but good nonetheless."
2,"OK coverage, but 1 danger area","The discusions of mercury, fluoride etc. are satisfactory, but this book pushes the preposterous Electro-dermal screening. A.k.a Electo-accupuncture According to Voll (EAV): Voll, a German scientist who researched in the 50's, but the research has never been verified or validated. EAV is a used by naturopaths and homeopaths without any scientific backing, that, as a homepathic dentist, I'm aware of."
3,better know your musical terms and music in general,"This is the hardest book I have ever read on music.It is an intence study and wordy in places that will boggle the home-grown musician. It reccomends other study materials in every chapter which I dont know where anyone could find the time to practice thier instrument.It should come with CD's with playing examples. But in all the book has a wealth of useful information, and if you're willing to go to Juliard and you're sreious then the book is for you."
2,It's a weak work for the purpose.,"The examples aren't objectives, and the book doesn't attend what it says in the title."
2,Too Many Hard-to-find Ingredients,"I bought this book shortly after it came out because there weren't many vegan cookbooks available when I purchased this book. I have been very disappointed with it, and I rarely use it. I bought it primarily because I was looking for vegan dessert ideas, but the desserts have ingredients that I have a difficult time finding because I don't live in a larger city. I would not recommend this book because there are far more accessable vegan books on the market, such as Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World (or any book by Isa Chandra Moskowitz)."
5,A Great cookbook in my collection!,"This is one of my favorite cookbooks that I own. There are a few pages that my fingers have been all over and you can tell how ""used"" the book is! I think the cornmeal custed tempeh is my favorite recipe in this book, and by the way THAT PAGE looks anyone would agree. I often change it up a bit and make it with Seitan instead of Tempeh for a change. This book was well worth the buy and I use it often!"
2,"Love the restaurant, the cookbook.... not so much","I have to preface this by saying that I absolutely love eating at the candle. So delicious.before we moved from NYC, I thought we HAVE to get this book. We've tried several of the recipies, following them to the letter, and have been really dissapointed everytime - with the exception of the hummus. I think that they must be leaving out some key ingredients in a lot of these recipies, because all of the ones we have attempted have been either completely flavorless, or tasted like salt. Don't even bother with the soups unless you are a gourmet cook and can figure out how to punch them up somehow after following these directions, because they all end up runny and bland. so sad."
2,"Filled with errors, and no insert with corrections.","I bought this cookbook at the Candle Cafe itself, after eating there several times and enjoying the food. As other reviewers have noted, this book is filled with serious errors that render many of the recipes inedible. For example, the oatmeal date bar recipe calls for 4 cups of oatmeal, 4 cups of oat flour, and only 1/2 cup of dates. The result is a solid slab of oatmeal with a thin streak of brown in the middle. Standard recipes call for 1 cup of dates for 1-1/2 cups of oatmeal.What is especially annoying is that there was no insert with corrections - even at the restaurant itself."
1,Recipe error,"This is honestly the worst vegetarian/vegan or any sort of cookbook that I have ever owned. Something is very wrong with many of the recipes and the amount of ingredients is totally wrong. eg. the Chocolate Macademia Nut Cookie recipe on p. 191. There is not enough liquid in the recipe and the cookie dough looks like sand. I added soy milk (~1/2-3/4 cup) till it resembled cookie dough, but the cookies came out a bit cakey. There are many other errors as noted by other reviewers. I'm sure the restaurant is great but the cookbook is terrible because you don't know which recipes will turn out right."
3,A few gems and a more than a few flops,"Many of the recipes in this cookbook yield delicious vegan food; the hummus is fantastic, the butternut squash soup smooth and comforting, and I make the diner-style pancakes several times a month. Too many of the recipes appear to have not been proofread or even tested, however, and they fail miserably. Steer clear of the cinnamon crumb coffee cake (too sweet, too oily, and most importantly, oozed its way out of the called-for 9"" pie pan) and the pumpkin pudding (thick as glue), for example. And the sauce and dressing recipes generate enormous amounts--what household is going to use up 3 cups of creamy wasabi dressing, which ""will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks""?"
2,Total dissapointment,"I think the recipes in this cookbook SOUND amazing. But I've made several recipes now, including the Pumpkin Pudding and Paradise Casserole, and they turned out tasting bland and uninteresting. I really expected more from a cookbook that comes from a renowned restaurant. I would not recommend this cookbook -- there are much better ones out there!"
2,Uneven Recipes,"I agree with what other reviewers have said. This book has many recipes that just don't come out right. The color photos are great, but the recipes don't hold up. I made one dessert recipe from this book (cookies), and the results were sub par. Baking is a little finicky to begin with, but this recipe needed to be tweaked. Luckily, I'm a professional so in the end the cookies were edible. For the unexperienced baker, these recipes could yield poor results."
4,Great Pancake Recipe,"The ""Diner-Style Pancakes"" recipe on page 201 is the single best reason to buy this cookbook. The pancakes turn out light, fluffy, and delicious every time. My child is allergic to eggs so we use this recipe for everyone, including any guests, because no one can tell that these pancakes are egg-free.""Jorge's Oatmeal Currant Cookies"" and ""Mini Potato Latkes"" also tasted great and were popular with the kids. The ""Vanilla-Cinnamon French Toast"" tasted good, but the texture was odd and it just didn't look right.In a future edition, the editor should make a note that when a recipe calls for 1 teaspoon egg replacer, it means 1 teaspoon of the powdered kind (such as EnerG) and not that we need to mix up liquid egg replacer (such as water, oil, baking powder) to use a teaspoon of that."
3,Not so great start,Just got the book and it is filled with very interesting gourmet vegan recipes. I have only tried one of the recipes so far with mixed results.The pie dough for the Savory Vegetable Potpie did not work out at all. It was way too moist and soupy. I'm not sure if the proportions were written wrong in the book. I tried to compensate by adding more flour but never did get it right. Finally I had to use one of my old stand-by pie dough recipes. The filling for this pie was good.I'm still looking forward to trying other recipes.
3,very hit or miss,"Some recipes are great, but some are so awful, it seems they were never tested. I really think they failed to edit the book properly. The chocolate macadamia nut cookies, for example, simply don't work. There's not enough liquid, as though an ingredient were missing. At the restaurant, I asked a chef, who said, ""just use a food processor to mix it."" Obviously, that didn't solve the problem. And recipes repeatedly say to whisk margarine, which is nearly impossible, even if it's at room temperature. Just use an electric mixer! Also, calling for 1/4 tablespoon is absurd--they should know measuring spoons don't come like that--just say 3/4 teaspoon! Stupid errors like this shouldn't be present in a cookbook from such nice restaurant. Still, some recipes, like the cobb salad, are delicious, which is why I give it 3 stars."
3,Not an accurate title,"I used this book as part of a class at the University of Maryland. What I have discovered is that Kammler didn't really write a very good book for a first course in Fourier analysis. I am a math/physics major and found the book to be very scattered for a FIRST course. For example, the first chapter just dumps a whole bunch of information without presenting much background or context. That being said, I do think the book contains a lot of valuable information and might be good for students already familiar with Fourier analysis (I should note that I was familiar with Fourier series and Fourier transforms prior to the class)."
2,Great toy with a major Problem,"That it's appropriate for toddlers, especially fans of the Disney Animated movie is indisputable but it's battery operated and you can't change the battery! What's up with that?"
4,Funny,"Cheap funny toy. The down sides are teaching kids to throw toys and causes them to get a little crazy. However, a week will go by and we forget about it until somebody accidently sets it off, and the fun begins all over again. It is soft enough to get hit in the face with from a child, but it will knock stuff off shelves if you don't monitor your child closely."
4,Great Read,"I have been reading books by Frankie J. Jones for a few years. She gets better with each one, as proven by Survival of Love. Her characters live and breathe; they aren't just words on paper. I felt like I knew them, and was very interested in their lives. When I finished this book, I wished her next book was written, printed and ready for me to read."
5,Amazing Story,"This book grabs you and takes you into the story with the characters. Denise and Jody are best friends who have everything. Denise has a daughter Ellen who is now all grown up and returns home, only after admitting she was a lesbian. Jody is shocked when she sees Ellen again because the brat kid she once knew was now a very beautiful and sexy woman. Ellen pursues Jody and they end up falling for each other, but their relationship could cause Jody to loose Denise's friendship. Jody and Ellen's relationship later is tested when Ellen becomes it.This was an amazing love story and one of the best I've read to date. I couldn't put it down - I needed to know how the story ended.Would highly recommend to anyone - it's just a wonderful book."
2,A lot of fun but BREAKS way too easy,"First we bought the smaller Air Hogs remote helicopter but the small propeller on the tail fin kept breaking (they give you three replacements total), we ran through the replacements in less than a day. So, we bought the Helix because it didn't have the tail fin propeller. BUT, we only got to play with the Helix for a couple of hours because it crashed and the whole tail fin snapped. These helicopters are a great idea and they are a lot of fun but unless you already know how to fly them and you're sure you're not going to ever crash don't get one because they are much to fragile to take the inevitable crashes you'll have learning to fly them."
4,Not balanced but can be overcomed,"Ok, I just bought the RC reflex. Control is pretty hard. Im still having trouble setting the trim. But I have found that several tricks to help.1. Start your prop slowly first. This allows the balance bars to set themselves correctly on their pivots.2. Once you take off it does tend to go in a certain direction. As soon as you are airborne hit the reverse jets and for some reason it stablizes the take off. The chopper doesn't hover well. So once you are up, go forward and it tends to help the balance issue.All of this makes me believe the chopper is inherently off balance out of the package. But the thrust controls seem to be able to over come it."
5,one of the first books dealing with high intelligence,A superintelligent child grows up in a world of what seem to him subnormals. One of the first books (originally 1911) dealing with super intelligence in a human being.
5,wonderful album,Great works by Liszt and well played by the orchestra. It's a nice switch from his usual piano compositions. Put this right up there with the other classical musical masters. Definitely buy this album - you won't be disappointed.
5,Alcazar - disco pop at its best,"Going beyond their first album, Casino, Alcazar rounds out its group to an even four with the addition of Magnus Carlsson (then-fiance of band member Andreas Lundstedt). Their lively dance beats are more than enough to make anyone want to get up and move. Following in the traditions of other Swedish super-groups, such as ABBA and Ace of Base, Alcazar (also an a-name, how peculiar...) brings together the old and the new, sampling songs from the '70s and '80s (the hey-days of disco) and mixing them into modern dance beats, along with original works.A personal favourite on this album is the track 'Love Life,' one that'll make you turn up the volume and hit the 'loop' button.This album is a must-have for any lover of dance and disco-pop. Be sure to include Casino and Alcazar's latest album, Dancefloor Deluxse (a greatest hits album including 3 new releases, and a previously unreleased version of 'Someday', the 2003 Stockholm Pride theme song)."
5,Classic Roots Harmonies!,"This CD was released in 1976 and is the trio's debut(even though they recorded a slew of massive single for studio one). For those who enjoy the harmonies of groups such as Israel Vibrations & The Abysisinians will no doubt add this to their list of crucial recordings. The vocals are split up between Albert Griffiths and Clinton Fearon. Both of them are not the greatest vocalist's but together they are massive! I think my two favorite songs here are ""looks is deceiving"" which Albert Griffiths compiles rural Jamaican probverbs to make his point. My other favorite is ""Eli Eli"" which is aslo fronted by Albert Griffiths with Clinton Fearon echoing in the background. This CD contains two Marley covers ""Soul Rebel"" and ""Rude Boy Ska"". In case you didnt know Clinton Fearon left the group in 1985 and is still making solid material with The Boogie Brown Band."
4,Also consider...,"All of this classic Front Line album apart from the tracks Know Yourself Mankind and Thief In The Knight can be found on the 19 track compilationDreadlocks, The Time Is Now. This also includes the single Pocket Money and tracks from Proverbial Reggae, Naturality and Sweet So Till."
1,Hoodwinked!,This book cost $108.00 and is full of errors. The instructor of my Intro To Control Class has contacted the publisher but to no avail. I am struggling in a course that I have always wanted to take and although my instructor is fanstastic this book gets a big fat F- from me. This book has failed and I hope that anyone who is forced to pay for this book isn't stuck paying full price. It's just not worth it!
5,A fantastic refererence for your HVAC/R library,"I love the way the author set this book up. You gradually build on what you learn and never really feel that you are being thrown in to hard. The writing is fantastic. Not to difficult in technological terms for the novice and yet levels with the seasoned veteran just right. When you complete a chapter , you are introduced to a "" In the field scenario"" service call. You imagine yourself at the call working out the problem in the component. You see how to step by step, use the common sense approach to troubleshooting and gain good skills in those procedures. The calls vary from simple to very complex. One thing is for very certain. You will enjoy having this book in your professional HVAC/R library."
5,Great service,The book I ordered was priced well and delivered to me far before I expected it to arrive. Great job.
1,Ego inflation.,"Only 2 reviews for a book by the ""master"" of Kenpo? If you ever spoke with the author or read any of his writings, you'd know why. Heck, even the 1 reviewer that did give this a 4 * rating admits he was given the book (i.e. Not worth actually spending the ca$h for it). This guy is a legend in his own mind. I read part of this book when a friend showed it to me. We both got a good laugh at this guy's constant self promotion. I looked up the author at a Martial Arts event once not to long ago. I found he runs a tiny little school in a tiny backwater town in California. If he was the great sage he claims, why can't he make it in a town with some competition? Why aren't his books actually selling? :oD"
4,Elderberry jelly,"I liked this jelly a lot. You could taste the elderberries. It was somewhat more sweet than the old home made jellies, but not enough to affect the enjoyment of finding good elderberry jelly. Glad I bought three!"
1,TRUE FACT...this book is not worth the price of the postage...,Some items that I've bought have been disappointing but not to the extent where I would even consider posting a comment. There are two mostly unfunny b/w poorly reproduced photos on most pages. Regrettable purchase...
2,"A lot of how, not enough why","This book is not for beginners, and may not be for anybody. It is poorly indexed, making it very difficult to find a desired topic. It is also largely based on step-by-step examples, without enough explanation of why something works the way it does. In other words, plenty of detail on specific, pre-determined tasks, but scant exploration of broad topics and ideas."
2,I found this book to be a bit confusing,"The idea is good to try to introduce ACCESS fundtionality through building up some real application (he uses that Northwind sample).However, I found that it is inadequately explained. Or in many instances, missing the explanation all together. On Chapter 26 - a basic intro of InfoPATH - a good attempt that fail miserably !! I thought he would explains how InfoPath would be integrated as an entry FORM for ACCESS Apps but it was just a basic intro of InfoPATH.Actaully I want to give only 1 star, but seeing that some examples from the CD could be made useful - so I give him one more star for that."
5,A comprehensive reference on all the diverse features,"Special Edition Using Microsoft Office Access 2003 by Roger Jennings is an impressively comprehensive and user friendly instruction manual ideal for those new to Microsoft Office Access 2003 software. A comprehensive reference on all the diverse features of Access 2003, and enhanced with new chapters on collaboration with Microsoft SharePoint Team Server, and creating or consuming XML Web Services, Special Edition Using Microsoft Office Access 2003 also includes Access 2003's new XML export/import features."
3,pretty good,"it is a pretty good cd,it does'nt compare to most savoy brown,but you can get it pretty cheap,usually in bargain bins,if you are a fan of old savoy(the great years)maybe pass it up,but really it is not that bad."
2,Worn Like An Old Coat,"If you like the same stuff you have heard over and over before, buy this one, hopefully from me. The long blues jam by Kim Simmonds on ""Tell Mama"" helps this one go down a little easier. Keith Boyce, the drummer du jour, plays well. For a live recording, Ralph Morman unfortunately sang like he couldn't wait to get his paycheck. The rest of the ensemble played their parts like supporting players waiting for Kim to carry them home. Probably the most disappointing part was that Simmonds didn't seem like he knew if they wanted to be a blues band, metal or boogie, so it came out as blootal. When I saw Savoy in the early 80's they were a power trio that weaved various moods of the blues through the set. Kim did the singing and took charge. On this one Ralph took over and Kim played. I'm afraid the band has seen its best days."
5,Children books,"A Christmas gift for my grand children. I was a book my daughter has requested. Our grand daughter loves book and sits for long periods of time if you read them to her. This one was really for our grandson, but hopefully they will both get enjoyment from it."
5,Absolutely classic literature! A must-read for all ages.,"This collection is an essential part of any library. One ofthe best set of stories ever created. So tender, smart, amusing &clever. I can't believe that there is anyone who has never heard ofPiglet, Pooh & Co.; but, this particular collection is so beautifully packaged & presented that even if you own other editions-you'll need this one! It's perfect. As someone else wrote, indulge yourself & those you love by buying this book."
5,THE BEST BOOK,"You can't find any book better than this one. I really love Pooh and this book, of course."
2,Written like a classic,"These are the original Pooh stories. Very interesting to see where Disney got their ideas from. The artwork is top notch. My copy also has a built in book mark-nice touch. The first few Pooh cartoons came directly from parts of this book. My problem was that I grew up on the cartoons and the book is quite different. Even though it's a children's book it isn't the easiest thing to read. My wife and I find ourselves stumbling through the book as we try to read it out loud to our 2 year old son who quickly gets boored with the long winded stories. Being a fan of Pooh history, I'm glad I bought it and it makes a great conversation piece (among my freinds that also grew up on the Disney version) but as far as my little guy is concerned I think he may need a few more years before he's ready for a book like this."
3,"Great Book, Wish it Had Been Shipped Properly...","The book is beautiful and just thick enough. I debated between this one and the box set, but am glad I went with this book instead. HOWEVER, the book arrived a little rough. The dust cover had not been checked/fitted properly and resulted in an ill-fitting dust-cover that I don't think any amount of flattening will fix. It was smashed and bent, which was especially disappointing as this was a gift. There were also dirty fingerprints all over the page tops. Overall, the book is great - just wish that it hadn't been dirty and with a proper dust cover."
5,The best book ever written,"I love the book and I think it is the best book ever written. The pace is slow and relaxing and it doesnt teach kids the wrong kind of things. My daughter loves the ""silly old bear""and his friends"
5,"This is my favorite book, I love all of the characters.","This is the best book!! I have read it a tons of times, but I still love to read it again. You learn all about hunting Woozles and trapping Heffalumps."
5,Winnie the Pooh is timeless literature for all children!,I have been reading Winnie the Pooh since I was a child. I bought this book for myself and enjoyed all the simple adventures of Pooh and his friends. I am now purchasing another for my godchild so he can enjoy this wonderful treasury!
5,You life is not complete,until you have read all about Pooh's adventures with his friends in the 100 Acre Woods. My mother read these classic storries to me (complete with varying voices for all of the characters). Milne manages to capture the essence of childhood thoughts and reasoning perfectly! If you haven't read this yet you should be ashamed of yourself!!
4,"""complete tales"" better for adults than kids","I would offer nothing but the highest praise for Milne's classic tales of childhood imagination, but...I humbly suggest that one should buy the individual books if you are intending them for a child's own library: The shorter books are long enough, and they will give the child a feeling of accomplishment when they finish each book, and will also give the impression that there are more stories alltogether.Dutton Children's Books has also published ten individual books by breaking the Winnie-the-Pooh books into stories (e.g. ""Piglet Is Entirely Surrounded by Water"" and ""Pooh Goes Visiting""), unabridged and with Shephard's original illustrations, published by Dutton. Perfect for your youngest readers.That said, if you are looking for something for your own library of for an adult reader, by all means, buy this book!"
2,"no instructions, and cannot set the day of the week--may be damaged","I received this on the last possible shipment arrival date, and it did not come with instructions. I have taken it to a jewelry store, to try to adjust it, and we still struggled for 2 hours! They do not repair or service watches, so I will take it to a watch repair shop...if they say that I received it broken, then I will return it for a refund--the watch looks very good-but for the price that I paid, I need for it to function for a few years at least, not break upon receipt."
3,The invention of pornography,Its very good with facts and historical stuff but there are better books on the subject out there.
2,Stace Writes Well,"Stace uses a number of interesting literary devices save a compelling plot. After Rose's departure from Love Hall, the story is muddled and plodding. I, like other reviewers here, found myself simply skimming in an effot to get to the predictable ending. Though the book started with great promise, it fell short. All in all, I wish I had saved my money."
3,Not what I'd hoped for. . .,"When Dickens originally wrote ""A Tale of Two Cities,"" it was serialized in a magazine and he was paid by the word. . .was Wesley Stace, too?"
5,The novel is back from the dead!,"By the looks of things, a handful of contemporary writers are returning us to the wondrous days when novels - not movies - were the dominant narrative form. No longer are our best storytellers cowed by Hollywood (no relation) into producing elliptical, bloodless tomes that refuse to compete with more visceral media. Wesley Stace is unafraid to sauce his tale with a tangy dollop of vulgarity. No artless hack, Stace, like Marquez, Rushdie, Grass, and on these shores Irving, is a complete writer. In the library at noon and the whorehouse at midnight. Nabokov said that a writer's job is to enchant. Well, Wesley Stace wears the hat. Surrender yourself to MISFORTUNE and you will be in his spell. Or just stare at that author photo for a while."
4,Holds your attention,"Starts off with a bang and keeps you turning the pages. The character descriptions are often efficiently precise. You know just who these people are with only a couple of sentences of description. On the other hand, it is sometimes hard to tell exactly in what period the story is set -- sometimes it seems Elizabethan, sometimes Early Industrial. Doesn't really matter, it's an enjoyable read."
2,Misfortunate,"The concept for this book was terrific... the execution, ....not so great. It started well...sexually confused English nobility finds abandoned baby and, although the baby is clearly a boy, he has reasons for raising the child as a girl. As the child ages, his gender becomes more obvious and he becomes more confused. Confused is the optimum word. He likes dresses. He hates suits. He is attracted to girls. It is all very confusing to him. Up to this point, the book was witty and funny.... but suddenly, from sexually ambiguous and unknowing, the author inserts a sequence that throws the narrator from innocent and confused to sexually aggressive and experienced almost instantly. It was then that the book lost me.... and apparently the author. One of the few books ever that I skipped entire chapters and didn't even care about the ending. Blah."
5,Rose's Fortune,"Discarded like trash, a baby boy is found and provided not just a good home but a home that has unimaginable abundance and excesses. The misfortune is that the rich benefactor is crazy...okay, we'll call him eccentric because he's rich. He decides he wants a female heir to inherit his vast fortune thus he engages in a hasty marriage with a memeber of his staff who indugles his unusual whim and agrees to raise the boy as a girl named Rose. This made me extremely sad, but when Rose comes of age, she embraces her identity and comes out of the closet--deciding to reveal her true identify, which is a young man who enjoys dressing and behaving like a girl.There are many humorous parts in this story, but for the most part, despite the wealthy lifestyle, I felt Rose was done an unforgivable injustice. Remarkably, Rose turns out unscathed and well-adjusted. This unique and poignant tale is beautifully written and deserves more than five stars."
3,Good story and characters but a little long,I found myself completely engrossed with this book largely due to the main character. Sadly as Rose figured out that she was a he I thought that the book began to get a little less interesting. I really wanted this novel to be great but the more I read the less great it got. I thought that the second half of the book was very slow ans sadly I found myself scanning and skipping sections just to finish it. The book finished exactly how I thought it would after reading the first half. I agree with another reviewer when they commented that less can be more and with this book I do think it was a bit much for what it actually needed. Having said that I still enjoyed the book and I will never forget the character of Rose Old.
4,Modern day Dickens novel,"Misfortune tells the tale of someone leading a dual life. The title of this entertaining novel has a double meaning too...think ""Miss Fortune"".Summary, no spoilers (which is VERY hard to do in a novel like this.)This story, which takes place in the early 19th century, is about a babe dramatically rescued from certain death. This child, who is named Rose, is raised as a proper English girl.The problem is that ""Rose"" is a boy.The plot thickens. Enter eccentric lords, greedy relatives, throw in some sexual content and a storyline that takes us to exotic lands, and you have an idea of the scope and fun of Misfortune.In true Dickens fashion, evil-doers are punished, coincidences abound, and you are led on a mad adventure in the process.This book is recommended. I do think it might have been shortened, as there were times when I thought the book a bit tedious....but I still think it's a fun read."
5,Don't judge this book by its cover,"I received this book as a gift a few years ago & was immediately put off by the unattractive cover and length. ""Ummm...maybe later,"" I thought, as I stuffed it ont my bookshelf. Well, later came a couple of weeks ago when I was between library books and so I (reluctantly) pulled MISFORTUNE off the shelf. ""At least I can give it a look & then put it in the donation pile,"" I told myself. I was very happily surprised to find myself immediately drawn into Rose's engaging story and the pages flew by very quickly. I highly recommend MISFORTUNE, and thoroughly enjoyed the ending in particular as well as the interview with the author after that. If there is a reprint someday I only suggest (beg, plead!): redesign that cover!!!"
4,Nelsons Cuts and Scrapes Cream With Hypericum and Calendula,"This is an excellent product. Good vendor. This product arrived on time and is as advertised, and at a good price."
1,Way too BIG!!!,I purchased this mask to use as part of my Halloween display. The mask arrived this week and it is so big that it is unusable. I measured across the top of the head and it is close to 12 inches and from top to buttom is 18 inches and 11 1/2 inches deep. The mask is so big you can not see out of the eye holes and breathing is very difficult. I considered using this mask as a part of a static prop hoping to attach it to a standing body. When I stuffed the head with foam rubber it looks just awful. I am not happy with this mask at all. It is a complete waste of money. The only reason I did not rate this at a zero stars it because I had to give it at least one.
5,A fast and exciting read...awesome insight!,His principles are 'right on' and he is sincere in his message. So relavent for those of us who seek to better integrate our business lives and spritual lives. Every chapter makes the reader eager to see what's next.
4,Doing Business by the Good Book,"One of the best books I've ever read. This doesn't only talked about how you should be doing your business, business etiquette but some very important verses from the Bible as well.Highly recommended."
5,Art for even the non-artist!,"I love this little booklet, with pure white covers and intriguing simple pieces of the artist's work inside, which look like little worms- she calls them flaps! Apparently they are 3 dimensional in the show. A couple of pieces in the back are like paint wiggles, which she calls agents. (There is an intro by Bill Arning which talks more about her work, to interpret it.) The best part? Under the back flap of the book is an actual watercolor on acetate piece of art!!! This is a limited edition of 500 catalogues. I can see why, with an original piece of art included. Great."
2,Well...,"I must admit that for its league, it's quite a piece of work. However, much of this CD is sickeningly mainstream, enough to make you shudder. If you're into that sort of thing and you listen to 92.3FM, this CD's for you. But for most real metal fans, I don't recommend it."
1,DVD Audio is a WASTE of Money,"This review is for the DVD Audio specifically. It is of very poor quality as far as DVD Audio go.I recently purchased a DVD Audio player and I bought some DVD Audios to try out. This was by FAR the WORST DVD Audio - the Surround sound 5.1 remixing is half ass to say the least - besides for one track, you can't tell the difference - would bring this back if I could. It is not like other SACDs and DVD Audio in which you can really hear the difference. More crap like this will not do anything for the promotion of DVD Audio over normal CDs"
4,Impressive debut album...,"This is clearly their most original, weighty, and musical album. The DeLeos and Weiland set out to rock, and they do just that. From the dark ""Sex Type Thing"", mysterious ""Sin"", and the beautiful instrumental ""No Memory"", the band plays a refreshing brew of grunge rock."
5,core- a dfiinitive must for rock and grunge fans,"okay, so you you're young, you love metal and grunge and kurt cobain is your god, even though you never shared the same time on the planet.Fair enough.What no one told you is that if Kurt is Jesus, then Scott Weiland is Moses. STP approach borders that make the US and UK peace Marshalls look like wimps.Aggressive beats and lyrics are followed by oxymoranic rythems and crooning, coupled with the the guitar solos of Dean DeLeo, you have a formula that rivals anything that penecillin has ever achieved.From the amazing melody of CREEP, captivating the soul of a wounded man, compared to unduly upbeat and character personified track of PLUSH, which asks so many questions and answers them in your own mind, you have a classic on your hand, and i challenge you to find a better grunge album, these guys would give Alice in Chains a run for their money."
5,Still the only STP album you ever need buy!,"As debut albums go, this one sure kicks the door in. Hard, thundering, blending grunge and metal into an alloyed sound that was altogether foot-stomping when I was just 19 years old.I gave the album another spin not too long ago, and even at the ancient age of 32, I still found this album to be an a**kicker. There is nary a poor track on the entire disc, and ""Plush"" is just flat-out classic rock the way rock was meant to be played.Then there is the much-maligned ""Sex Type Thing"". Forget the lyrics. What about the music?! Headbanging, all the way. One of the most heabangingest tracks I have ever heard, and to this day I can't listen to this track without bobbing my head vigorously.It's been fourteen years, and I still point to this album as perhaps the ONLY album by STP that any rock fan ever need own. The rest, while good in their own respect, never quite wowed me the way this debut album wowed me. I highly recommend it."
4,This is much harder then the rest of their albums,"This a great album, with all of the songs on it being good. The best song of my opinion is plush. Buy it you will not be dissapointed."
4,An ok album from a great band,"For all of you heavy metal obsessed people, this album might just be one of the best of the 90s for you. But for the people that actually derive true emotion and pleasure from music will not see this album in quite the same light. While all the songs in reality are good, I cannot classify them up in the ranks with Purple or Tiny Music. But then again, that's just my opinion. This was the first STP album I bought, but I still think that the later albums were better. So if you've only heard Purple, or any later albums (and you don't like heavy metal) then I don't recommend this album to you. If you like heavy metal or very hard rock, by all means buy it."
4,"Amazing Debut, Amazing CD, but not my favorite from STP","Track by Track Review:1. Dead & Bloated - 9/10 Strong Opener,sets the tone for the entire CD2. Sex Type Thing - 10/10 One of the best rock songs of the 90s3. Wicked Garden - 9/10 Another great song, good vocals4. No Memory - 7/10 Nice Little Instrumental Track5. Sin - 8/10 A good song overall, a little repetitive6. Naked Sunday - 10/10 One of my Favorite STP songs ever7. Creep - 8/10 A Good, Slow Song8. Piece of Pie - 9/10 A little Generic, but a great song still9. Plush - 10/10 Most people know this song, its a hit and it deserves to be10. Wet My Bed - 6/10 A very weird poem by Scott11. Crackerman - 10/10 An STP Classic, very fun song12. Where the River Goes - 8/10 Good Song, but too long and repetitiveThis album is an awesome album and I recommend it to anyone who likes rock, hard rock, grunge, or just good music. The only thing that kept this from 5 stars was its a little repetitive, but all the songs are great."
5,This CD is way underrated....,"Core is a great Cd for the debut of STP. ""Wicked Garden"", ""Sex Type Thing"", and ""Plush"" are great songs. It rocks!"
3,One of the best rock FM albums of the 90's...,"The first time i heard ""Core"" was back in '93, and at the time it sounded pretty good to me. It's not a kickass rock album, in the sense that probably you won't cherish most of it's songs for the rest of your life, but it is truly much better than some of it's ""radio"" counterparts, such as Bon Jovi or Live, or more recently Creed. Truth be told, Scott Weiland is one of the best vocalists of the 90's and instead of comparing him to Eddie Vedder (they don't sound alike at all) he is an icon for most of the follow-up's (hello Scott Stapp, et al). For all of you who enjoy what a friend of mine calls ""cutie-rock"", this is indeed a very good album, full of nice melodies and some (just some) weight. Everybody knows ""Plush"", but ""Sex Type Thing"" is much better, more corrosive, and ""Piece of pie"" is also very good. Nowadays i give it a three for the memories, but i really couldn't give it any less. If you like the genre, and you don't own it, buy. You'll like it."
5,Rockin To The Core,"Amazing debut album from Stone Temple Pilots and although their subsequent releases were all very good (with the exception of Shangra La Dee Da) this was by far their best.Crushing guitar riffs, strong powerful vocals backed up by thundering rhythm section combined with great song writing made this an essential purchase at the time of it's release.Well worth buying"
5,This cd is the best cd from STP ever!,"I have been looking for this cd for a long time. I just love this version of plush. It is worth the money. If you love STP, then you love this cd!"
4,Stone Temple Pilots - 'Core' (Atlantic),"Review number 172.As some of us,including myself might assume that STP had come from Seattle,turns out they're actually from San Diego.Hadn't heard this,the band's first CD in awhile.With tunes like ""Plush"",""Dead And Bloated"",""Naked Sunday"" and ""Sex Type Thing"",intact,the listener(s) know they're in for some prime heavy-duty early '90's grunge.In fact,this whole disc rocks.Line-up:Weiland-vocals,Dean DeLeo-guitar,Robert DeLeo-bass and Eric Kretz-drummer.I believe I saw these guys open for Megadeth on this very tour.What an experience!Recommended."
3,a good album but probably their weakest,"i am a huge stp fan but i would have to say i listen to this cd the least. it definately has alot of hits on it which are great songs but thats about it with this cd. most of the songs pretty much have exactly the same vibe,sound,and production. its produced very loud , which i guess is fine but it doesnt have the diversity of every STP cd that followed. I know alot of people argue that this is the best one and they shouldnt have changed their sound but do we really need 5 STP cds that sound exactly like this. unlike some other people i prefer a band to grow and change their direction a little and experiment with new styles. STP did this and got better with each new album. the songwriting got way better and Scott didnt sing with same ""angry"" voice that he did on Core. Overall its a good cd and i can kind of recommend it but any other STP cd is a better choice."
4,This album smells like a rose (that somebody gave me...),"So many classic songs lie within... most you've probably heard and loved but never realized were compiled onto one amazing CD. Wicked Garden, Sex Type Thing, Creep, Plush: all these titles were just that... titles, to me when I bought the CD to listen to Dead and Bloated. Then I realized I had purchased a classic grunge album, second only to Nirvana's Unplugged in New York."
4,Great Debut Album,"This is a great album, probably one of the best debut albums of any kind i've ever listened to. If you like Pearl Jam and do not mind listening to a CD that sounds similar to Pearl Jam, you'll love this album. I for one am not a huge fan of Pearl Jam, and I seem to like the second album ""Purple"" better becasue by that stage in their musician hood they seem to have established their own style of music, rather than sounding like an already existing band. If your money goes to originality, ""Purple"" is for you, but to you Pearl Jam style listeners, this CD is right up your alley. This album does however have my second favorite STP song, Wicked Garden, on it."
2,A big f*****n noize!!!,"What a dreadful album, by far the worst Stone Temple Pilots album.Why does everyone like ""Plush so much? Its an awfull noisy sludgy easily accessible and very boring song!The whole album is driven by loud fat lazy guitar riffs and sinks like a fat stone to the bottom of the pool.For goodness sake, what the hell was the point of that vulgar track ""wet my bed"" - yuck what is this a f$#@$n freak show or something!""Purple"" has its moments, but Interstate Love Song and Big Empty there most popular tracks that are on that album are so boring.STPs first real good album with some of the most amazing songs I have heard is on ""Tiny Music....."" and ""No4"" is a great album to, full of heavy straight forward rockers and some brilliant slower songs.""Sherang Laa Dee Da"" there last one is just awful.A horrible album from a band that went on to better things - for a while."
1,A snooze...,"In my opinion, there is only one redeeming song on this album...Sex Type thing. The rest of it turned out just like all the rest of the albums they have released to date...ABSOLUTELY BORING! They have found guitar riffs that dont sound good, drum beats that a 3 year old with no arms could handle, and lyrics that examplified the same rambling gibberish that most of the Seattle bands regurgitated at the world. Thank goodness grunge is dead...may it rest in peace...forever."
3,Just what a first album should be,"Gruff and mangy, this one's a good starting point for what turned out to be one of my favourite bands. It may not be all that musically inventive, in terms of the guitar work/beat/ ect., but it sure makes me shimmy!"
1,this is not worth 6 bucks!,I could have written this very short article- and I don't know much about interiorscaping. The content is just about someones vague opinion on the subject as well as some obvious statements and there is no good information to get out of this. I highly recommend NOT buying this eDoc.
5,Awesome!,"If this Spiller single doesn't get you out on the dance floor, then you have a big problem! I heard this song while in London and absolutely fell in love with it! It makes you want to get up and move around by yourself or with someone. The samples and grooves are excellent."
2,If I could I would have ordered a different card,"First of all it did not come as pictured, there is no fan on my unit, only a heat sink. When I used the standard Vista driver for this card (it appeared to be a 1300 series card) it was okay but a little slow. Once I downloaded the ATI driver from their web site it is faster but there is a lot of snow on black backgrounds. It's a cheap card and you get what you pay for. Send a little more money and purchase a better card."
2,Esperaba un producto de mejor calidad / I expected a better quality product,Recientemente compre estos deflectores para un Toyota Yaris/Echo del 2004 tipo sedan los cuales quedaron perfectamente.Sin embargo la calidad del producto es mala. Es muy parecida a otros deflectores que uno puede encontrar fuera de Amazon y por un valor mucho menor.Adicionalmente el acabado deberia ser mejor. La orilla de los deflectores trae filo con el cual se puede uno lastimar facilmente. Es en serio.------I recently bought these deflectors for Toyota Yaris / Echo sedan 2004 type which were perfectly.However the quality of the product is bad. It is very similar to other deflectors that one can find outside of Amazon and a much lower value.Additionally the finish should be better. The edge of the deflectors brings edge with which one can easily get hurt. I'm serious.
3,Great Toy (if you can put it together),"This playset is great - my son loves it. You do have to be careful with the open sides - it is very easy to fall off. My only complaint was puting it together. The instructions are horrible and have no words - only pictures. The parts are hard to tell apart (the color-coded bolt caps all look the same in the instructions) and the pieces are hard to handle. Give yourself extra time to work through the instructions and get a couple of friends to help. Also, a power screwdriver should be a required tool to get the screws into the plastic."
3,Not quite worth it...,"We bought for my son's 1st birthday. I know he is a little young as far as the recommendation, but he is a climber and loves slides at the playground. However, this is not at all interesting for him. The most he does is try to climb up the little slide. It was also a pain to put together. My husband works a lot, so I tried putting it together with the help of my neighbor--f.y.i: two women are not strong enough to snap the pieces into place. Luckily her husband had the ""brute strength"" needed to do it. The directions are not clear, so make sure you put it together and check everything a few times before you drill the screws in. Buying the swing set accessory probably would have made this more fun for our son."
4,Great Toy,"My son is 16 months old and so far loves this climber. I know he's a little young for it, but I figure he'll enjoy it for a very long time. Assembly was a little difficult, but not too bad. My only concern is there is one side that is completely open. Any child could fall off. Obviously, adult supervision is a must. Other than that, it's great."
2,Could've been good but very sickly,"In this release Melanie tried to create a very modern love song, with sweeping synth lines and Erasure-esque hooks. Unfortunately the result almost makes me want to puke. It's so sickly and putrid, very lovey-dovey as well, and doesn't go far enough in its intended direction. The potential for it to have been a classic was there, but it missed the mark by some way."
4,She used to be a Spice Girl?!?!,"Well, melanie c has sure taken a big leap away from her days as a spice girl. the first time i heard this track was on a muisc video network and fell in love with the song and had to get the album. but, if i would have known that only 3 of the tracks were worth listening to, i would not have spent so much money on it. the first track, the hex hector radio edit, of ""i turn to you"" is a wonderful dance remake. it is typical hex hector material and sounds wonderful. the second as well as fifth tracks, are alright remixes and sound too much like techno for my liking but are still listenable for me. the full length hex hector remix is much like the radio edit but is almost 3 times as long. the 4th track, a live version of her hit, ""never be the same again"" is a wonderful ballad which features lisa ""left eye"" lopes of tlc. melanie c, ""i turn to you"" is a great effort at a remix single release and is worth buying if you like pure dance and club music."
4,I Turn To You,"I'm a religious fan of any Hex Hector remix out there, so it is my duty to give my opinion on this single. I'm not much of a Spice Girl fan, but I must admit this track really took me by surprise. Not so much the vocals but the music behind it. Specifically the Hex Hector remix. I have to admit he is a genious when it comes to recreating a club feel to any song. I highly recommend this track to all club/dance fanatics."
5,THIS IS THE VERSION TO GET!,"You have come to the right place if you want the best versions of I Turn To You. Get this version instead of the other versions. This song just blows me away every time I hear it. I feel this song so much I can barely describe it to you. If you don't own it, what are you waiting for? A timeless Club classic."
1,Camark Pottery Vol 11,"I was very disappointed in the book. The author goes on and on about the History of Camark, but very little information about the various glazes used. Sorry I bought it."
4,It was an interesting concept,"Many of these are on so called Fright night discs. Here we have more of the storms and the melancholy.I have not played every track, as I just collected the favorites on an iPod. The retro cover reflects some of the recordings being old but I found no fault with the recording sounds.Barbirolli has several top notch pieces.I may give it a 5 once I get used to all the pieces."
5,Love love love this book!!!!!,"The copy I purchased was an old library copy still in fine condition. The book is so great, both my kids love it and so do the neighbors kids (age range 4-9). I love it too, it has a way of making a thunderstorm something miraculous! Highly recommend!"
3,false description and wrong picture,"The wrong picture is posted. The real thing is a KP-653 which is on the Power Acoustik website. However the specs of the model on the website and my purchase were different: the magnet is not 18 oz, its 13 oz, dB is not 91, its 90, and voice coil is not 1.25 inch, its 1 inch. It's still 6.5"", 160 watt max and 3-way. Ironically, they look the same. Whatever, its still a good value and plays nice."
3,Christmas Gift for my son,"These were purchased as replacement speakers for worn out factory's. Not meant for bass, that's for sure! Sounded clear all throughout our testing phase. Good for mid-bass, vocals and highs. Good purchase for the price!"
4,Good Buy,"I purchased these speakers as replacement for the front speakers in my 2003 Jeep Liberty. After many modifications to make it work for my Jeep, I am very pleased with their performance so far (3 weeks). The sound quality is good for the price. My decision to purchase these speakers was not based on the bass quality, which is not the greatest; however, I recommend these speakers for anyone who seeks quality and affordability. Bottom line: Good Buy"
5,It is a very relating book!,The Third Eye is a book I can relate to. It makes you feel like you are really there and you are the person having the pshycic abilities. It kept me in suspence all the time. You would think she was about to die and then she'd break free. When she found the child I had this great feeling of relief like it was my kid. I recommend this book to everyone.
3,Great premise,"I liked the idea of the storyline about an eighteen year old woman who comes into her psychic powers, too bad Karen and her Mother detract from it. Had Karen not been so spineless, allowing people to tell her what to do and how to think, she'd have been a much more compelling heroine. Karen's mother was so far over the top, she wasn't likable in any way, and got on my nerves. I would have enjoyed more interaction with Ron, that wasn't him goading Karen into doing what he wanted her to do. This was an okay read."
3,The Thrid Eye,"Overall I think that this book was very well thought up.The plot of the book was very well.I mean a story about being able to see where a kidnapped boy is,that is really good.Also the suspence was perfect, I wanted to just skip pages just to see what would happened.But of course al things have their up's and down's.There was only one down in this book.It took too long,It way too long to get from one part to another.For example it took at least 2 chapters to find out that Bobby was lost.Like I said before it was a good book but took too long."
4,Read The Third Eye,"Ths is a very suspensful story. Karen Connors is worried about the things she can see. When she closes her eyes visions come from places where stolen children sleep, and lost children wonder. Karen dosent want to see the things she does but she does. This book is field with a little love, a little humor and lots of suspence. YOu cant wait to get to the next chapter."
4,Third eye,For the first time in Karen is in the popular crowd at school. Then one of the nieghborhood children disappears karen discovers that she can somehow see the missing child. The first chapter karen is babysiting two children and her boyfriend comes in to see her and he starts to kiss her and she saids no because of the little ones and he gets mad and walks out slaming the door behide him. Karen starts to cry and get upset and thinks he might call of their date tonight. Thats where i left at.
5,THE WONDERFUL MUSIC OF NELSON EDDY,"A COMPLATION OF THE FINEST SONGS SANG BY THE WONDERFUL NESLON EDDY. INCLUDING HIS FAMOUS ""STOUTHEARTED MEN"". THESE ARE SONGS HE DID WITHOUT HIS MUSICAL PARTNER JEANETTE MACDONALD."
4,pretty nice,"this mp3 player is a great deal for the price. it does everything an mp3 player should, although the battery life is a little short (new battery every 2 1/2 - 3 hrs. continual play). rather than that, i love it. go for it!"
5,Great For OB Rotation,"I'm a 4th year medical student. Bought this back during my OB/GYN rotation, since the hospital said we had to have one. I think I actually used it about 3 times during my rotation, and was actually given another one for free the 3rd week I was there. But I had already bought this one. This is easy to use and has a ton of information you can tell the new mom. It gives you estimated delivery date, how many weeks along she is, the estimated fetal weight and fundal height, and milestones that are/should be occurring at different stages of the pregnancy.I would definitely buy one of these for your OB rotation. Even if you don't get much use out of it, you'll look good for showing up with it and it's cheap anyway."
3,very handy item,"Nothing fancy, but is handy for those wanting to conceive. My wife and I are using it to figure out when to start trying so we can avoid a baby being born in certain months."
1,Seriously?,You have got to be kidding me. Who is trying to sell these? This is a laminated paper wheel. It looks like something you would get for free from the doctors office. I though it would be at least plastic and bigger and easier to read.
5,Definitive history of aboriginal history from 1788,"I have always felt that the official history of Australia was very strange and very boring. It contained scarce mention of large scale conflicts and almost no mention of the people who had been occupying our land for the 30,000 years prior to european colonisation. Many people who have learned about the history of white Australia have felt the same but Henry Reynolds was one of the few people to become active in the field and say definitively that black history deserves a voice and that black history is so very different to the stereotypes and urban mythologies that have come to characterise it for many Australians. This book and others that have been influenced by Reynolds' stance have thoroughly changed the way many people see Australian history and I predict it will influence many people to take a more compassionate and integrated view of other races."
3,NOT as pictured.,"The product I received - and the packaging calls it the Tennis Crew Sock Level 2 has a padded instep (which is to protect the foot from the shoelaces). However, the picture associated with the product does not show it nor does the description state such. Also, the 'hem' around the top of the sock is bulkier than that pictured. The three stars is because the sock did not match the picture. And I do not like instep padding."
1,HORRIBLE SOCKS - Ball up with lint and Look Terrible,"I bought a pair of these and a pair Thorlo Men's Coolmax Lt Hikers at the same time. They were $15 each. The Hikers are great socks. After six months they are clean, very soft and very comfortable socks. These white socks are balled up with dark lint, the material is pealing threads off and they look so bad I won't wear them with shorts. They are just like $2 socks only thicker, harder and ugly. They are absolutely disgusting. I could have bought a six-pack of Hanes and had change for what I paid for these."
2,Washing is a problem,I washed this pad for the first time and it came apart at the seams. One of the patch fabric squares is of a very loose material so the stitching pulled it apart. I even washed it on the delicate cycle.I would suggest purchasing one without the patchwork!
2,Am I Missing Something,"I got this cover as a gift, along with the Baby Trend High Chair, and I was most appreciative. I love the chair, btw. Anyhow, I have started feeding my 4 month old and, due to spills and splatters, needed to change the chair cover. I went to put this cover in for the day, and to my suprise, THERE WERE NO SLOTS FOR THE SAFETY HARNESS!!! What's up with that??? I'm not rendering it useless, but I'll definately have to get a different cover for my daughter's high chair."
2,Don't wash too many times...!,I have washed this high chair cover only a few times (6 maybe) and it is already starting to come apart at the seams. I would expect better quality since it is obvious we will be washing it often...it is pretty though. And pads the hard wood.
3,Cute but came apart,I bought this pad when we bought a wooden high chair so that my 15 month old would be more comfortable. After it was dirty I washed it and put it back on the high chair and noticed that the quilt pattern was unraveling. It is a very cute pattern but as much as you need to wash it; it isn't sterdy enough.
2,Chair Pad Not the Quality I Expected.,"I purchased this additional chair pad for obvious reasons, to be rotated with the original chair pad when dirty. I think I washed the pad twice and the patchwork began tearing at the seams. If I were to have to do over, I probably would not purchase this product, my son is a typical 11 month old and chair pads don't make it more than one or two meals before having to go to the laundry."
3,high chair pad,"I was glad to find the high chair pad atAmazon.com. I had been looking for one for a whie and was having dificulty finding it. It fits the chair nicely also. I was disappointed in the amount of padding. It is very thin, but serves the purpose."
1,disappointment,"Never received this product and I kept waiting for it to arrive...then I decided to call and found out that it was not available....very, very disappointed that I was not informed by Amazon, that I had to call and wait another few weeks for another company to deliver a high chair pad for our baby!!!!!"
2,am i the only one who thinks the pattern is out-dated?,"well, besides the fact that i just think the pattern is displeasing to the eye ((maybe OK for a girl but my sis-in-law recieved this for her son & ICK totally disgusting))we both argreed that the pattern is out-dated. but besides the appearance there are no slots for the safety harness ((i guess they don't want your child to be safe?!?)) Regardless she washed it to get ready for baby cuz even though it's ugly sometimes you need a back-up high chair pad...after the 1st washing fell rite apart! I read one review where she said she line-dryed it well who has time for that w/a baby?! I know we dont lol..."
5,Very soft and snuggly,"I just got the bear, so it's hard to say how durable it will be. However, it is very soft and snuggly, and is a very appealing little bear. Cute as can be, with a sweet face and funny litte stubby tail. Appears to be very well-made."
2,A product with flaws,"This replacement works fine but may need to be replaced over time. This is my third replacement because parts making connections have broken or have become corroded. Because of the price, these placements become a concern. Printed circuit boards shouldn't be this expensive!"
2,Not a very smooth read...,"I have no idea of the accuracy or inaccuracy of the information in this book, but as a medical student and engineer and interested reader, I can say it is not a smooth read. You must wade through many wordy paragraphs to find small nuggets of poorly organized information. I find it difficult to believe that this was a ""report"" -- you certainly can't dial up any desired info very easily by checking the table of contents -- you have to really hunt for stuff, and then may find yourself disappointed with the lack of detail that results.It is certainly a reasonable addition to a personal library for those interested in the topic, but it is by no means a solid reference."
2,Fascinating Study In Government Whitewashing,"The government's theory is that these periodic ""We're sorry and it will never happen again"" blue ribbon committees will assuage the public and make us forget the outrage. Read it and then ask, ""Why wasn't anyone sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity?"""
5,Love these shoes!,Ordered this shoe in white. Received them today.....Love em! Can't wait to wear them to my meeting Monday.
2,Disappointed because of all the scenery shots.,"The video started out great with Mr. Segovia playing a couple of peices but quickly degraded to just scenes of the Spanish country-side with only the music being played in the background.If I was interested in seeing Spain, I would have bought a video to that end.I wish I could return this tape but unfortunately you cannot return opened video packages!!!Extremely disappointed, expected more playing and less scenery."
4,Basic Introduction,"From the ""Introduction"" :The text of this book will acquaint the student with the various methods of reproduction, including the care and handling of the original drawings. Strong empahsis is placed on the development of visualization, which is the very basis of print reading and an all-important factor in the training of the beginner. Freehand sketching of inanimate objects and familiar construction shapes in orthographic and isometric drawings will be used. A comprehensive list of building terms and abbreviations will afford a new vocabulary for entering this new world. Complete illustrations of standard symbols and conventions for all the major trades, line-work indications and title boxes will prepare the student for his or her eventual task. Details of component parts, complete working drawing and elevation drawings round out the learning experience."
3,Sturdy Hopalong Cassidy adventure.,"A ruthless outlaw gang is bent on cattle stealing and murder. The Hopalong Cassidy series is a cut above the typical B Western. The Harry Sherman production values and the sturdy direction of Lesley Selander are a treat. William Boyd's portrayal of Hopalong Cassidy is part of Western film history that carried over into the Baby Boomers' Saturday morning TV diet. The characters are loosely based on the writings of Clarence E. Mulford. Boyd's black-suited, silver-haired cowboy on a white horse is pure Hollywood fabrication. Regardless, there is enough riding, shooting, and action to please fans. Young actors George Reeves (of Superman fame) and Robert Mitchum play rivals for the local Pearl Pureheart. One of our favorite bad guys, Victor Jory, is the villain. There is some mild comic relief from Andy Clyde, and a mule named Molly. As usual with Hopalong Cassidy flicks, the action builds to a climactic shootout with the outlaw gang. Saddle up and ride pardner.;-)"
5,Michael Crawford is the all time best,"Michael shows his favorite songs in this cd, his voice is so clear and powerful, get this cd you'll love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Don't order!!!,"This item number (20-260) is listed elsewhere online as a 12-pack of legal pads. Ordering this item via Amazon results in a shipment of a single (yes, ONE) legal pad -- for over $11. Insane. I would rate this as ""zero"" stars if that were possible.Attempted a return, but that's not an available option, just a ""replacement.""All very silly."
4,Worth the money.,"Pretty much you are gettig what you pay for with these speakers. WHile you won't win any contests with their sound quality, they serve the purpose. I bought these for a truck that is driven very little. If I spent more time in the vehicle, I would certainly have spent more money to improve the sound quality."
3,Revenge,"Liv Elliot had been engaged to marry boyfriend, Tim, after going out with him for 5 years, but was beginning to have second thoughts about marrying him. When Tim suddenly tells her, just weeks before their wedding, that he too was having doubts, she's furious that he was the one to speak first and got all huffy at being dumped. She and her girlfriend, Alex,take themselves off to Sydney, Australia where Alex has a place by the beach to stay in, courtesy of the boyfriend who is really Alex's sugar daddy. Liv meets a couple of gay men who become her close friends and encourage her to join in their luxury underwear making venture, but who also direct her in her search to find and keep a boyfriend. It's a very light piece of fluff but an entertaining read to fill in a spare moment."
4,Love Clare Naylor,"I've enjoyed every Naylor book, and this was no exception. The story is cute, fun, and light. The characters were engaging, and I liked having the story move to Australia for a change. While there's nothing earthshatteringly different about the story - girl, boy, job - it's wonderful. I'd highly recommend this book and any other Naylor book for anyone looking for a fun, fast read."
1,I read better stuff in 9th grade creative writing,"This is the most inconsistent book I've ever read. One moment the main character, Liv, is a dowdy copy of Janeane Garafolo in 'The truth about cats and dogs', the next she's an unconquerable sex goddess. The references to Sydney are off (there are 8 digits in Australian phone numbers). The only thing consistent about the book is the tired, unbelievable plot and lack of grammar and imagination. I had to wonder if this book was edited at all, obviously never by anyone who's been to Sydney. The book is a sad [copy] of ""the Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing"", which is much more enjoyable, and professionally done."
4,Nice Summer Read!,"This was a very funny book. I was a bit dissapointed b/c I had a little bit more expectations but it was still a great book. I love the sense of humor this author had. I don't want to say it's the best book i've read all summer, but at times I couldn't put the book down. I do recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book to help out w/a broken heart. It will you lighten up your day!!"
3,cute book,"I found this book a quick and easy read for the summer--but at times it is a bit confusing to follow the writing style. Toward the end, it seemed that the author just wanted to finish it and so it was all just swept along. The characters are fun, and the idea of treating men like dogs with their balls is very entertaining. Other than re reading passages to figure out who was saying what, and to figure out that time had passed without knowing it in the scene, it was a fun summer get away."
2,"Fun summer read, ,,, ,","Great descriptions of the beautiful hunk, leaves a woman craving a trip down under. This was a fun reead, but at times the main characters were a bit too hysterical for me ... the hysteria went on and on for a bit too long. Still, it was an enjoyable get-away from one's hum-drum daily plan."
4,Too cute to put down,"What do an accountant, a socialite, 2 homosexuals and an archetect have in common? A lot more than you think....I have to admit that it took me about 40 pages to really get into this book, but once I did, I didn't want to put it down. Liv is someone I could totally relate to and Clare Naylor keeps you wanting to know more about Liv, Alex and everyone who pops in and out of their lives. I spent an entire Sunday reading ""Dog Handling"" because I just couldn't put it down. While at times it could be a little predictable there was enough to keep you guessing and wanting more.Good read."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I purchased this book based on the reader reviews and could not believe that it was given such high marks after reading it myself. Of course I was expecting it to be a light read, but this was unbearable. There was no character development, and the story line was a bit unbelievable. I believe that I only kept reading it just to see if it could get any worse. Which it did. I can't believe the author was able to get this published. Not to mention that someone actually admits to EDITING this train wreck.There are so many other good books in this genre, I wouldn't waste your money on this one. Marian Keyes, Jane Green, Sophie Kinsella and Jennifer Weiner are just a few who have produced witty and enjoyable reads that don't make you want to rip it apart, page by page, after you have finished."
3,If a Man Answers,"What's dissapointing about this, is that the concept is ""borrowed"" from a hard to find, but FABULOUS Bobby Darrin- Sandra Dee movie: ""If a Man Answers"". In the movie, Sandra Dee's french mother (can't think of the actress) tells Sandra the only way to keep her photographer husband's attention away from the models posing for him, is to treat him like a dog. Oh so similar... Book doesn't come close to the movie, sad to say."
3,Entertaining Fluff,"A witty and entertaining foray into lingerie and romance, but in all honestly this British import is little more than a harlequin romance novel dressed up with bigger words and fewer euphemisms for genetalia. Farm Fatale is a superior example of this genre."
3,A good beach or rainy day read,"Out of last year's (2002) two girl goes to Australia, girl sells lingerie titles (Clare Naylor's ""Dog Handling and Leigh Riker's ""Strapless""), Clare Naylor is the winner.Liv goes from days of accounting at a hat designer's, spending more time on ""Naked Brad"" then spreadsheets to the beaches of Australia and helping mold Greta Grundies from a mere market stall brand into a sensation.Light? Yes. Amusing? Yes. Worth the staying in bed until the last minute to get ready for work and not get stuck in traffic? Yes."
1,Boring and poorly written!,"This book is so predictable that you'll know the ending after reading the first chapter. Worse, though, it was apparently never proofread. I've never seen so many grammatical errors in one book!"
3,Fun but average,"This is a story about recovery after a bad breakup, reinventing of self and reigniting an old flame. It was also about knowing how to handle men (or dogs, same thing!) in order to keep them coming back for more. This was a fun read, although I do have to say that there wasn't really anything special about it. However, it was enjoyable and effortless to read.-indifferent"
3,A good beach read...,"Alright, so Clare Naylor's book won't answer political questions or rid the world of disease, but it's a book to consider if you're just intent on winding down with something easy to read that has some laughs. Keeping up with Liv's antics and her sessions of ""dog training"" proves to be amusing, but don't think too hard about this book after you've read it--the sugary quality of it will cloy you.Yes, this book is safest when restricted to reading on the beach, or anywhere else that doesn't require much thought."
4,Clarinet interpretations,"This 1996 album is by a friend of Vangelis, Greek clarinetist Vassilis Saleas and the album notes mention discussions between the two on matters of interpretation. It is a cover/hommage album with a difference: the clarinet (with backing acoustic instruments and synths) provides a more obviously ""Greek"" atmosphere to Vangelis' more universal melodies. The album contains many more tracks than are listed here. Saleas has done similar work on his album of Theodorakis' work: ""Litany"". If you like this you should also try music by Greek film composer Eleni Karaindrou e.g. Music for films. (Note to Amazon: the track listing for that ECM album is also severely truncated and it is NOT a jazz album. ECM also does classical/film music)"
1,A good collection spoiled by Problem Child.,I would have purchased this collection if Problem Child was NOT in it! This movie is SO bad I don't want any part of it. The child character is so awful you just want him to be run over by a bus. John Ritter is wasted here.
5,This is my favorite show ever...,"Anyone who has not laughed at this show clearly has no sense of humor whatsoever. My favorite character is (burp) Bobby Fletcher. Special Ed's pretty funny, too."
1,Crank Yankers Not Funny,Please do not waste your money. I could not even force a smile. Every disc was just awful.
2,"Great Concept, But...","Crank Yankers misfires on more calls than it scores laughs on. Some of the calls are just nasty and pointless...like making pornographic comments to old ladies...not funny. I laughed out loud a few times (mostly from the retard!), so if i didn't have to suffer through the pointless calls and the disturbing calls, I would have loved the DVD. (Also, they need to remake the old man; his ears are too disgusting to look at.) I recently viewed a new episode of Crank Yankers on TV and it was so vile that I am now too disgusted by the show to ever watch it again. This show could have been great in the hands of people with more creativity and less maliciousness and less filthiness."
1,A re-hash of other books,If you are going to buy a book on Dice setting I think that Scoblete's books are much more informative and interesting
1,Snooze!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Man Who Wasn't There (1983), is a so called comedy. Not a funny movie, nor an entertaining one. I can use one word to sum up this movie: POOP!"
3,if this is your first running book then it is 5 stars,"execellent book for the beginners. the principles are short, comprehensive, precise and right to the point. but for the intermediate and advance runners, this book has nothing new to offer other than repeat and remind of what you have already learnt."
4,A great motivational tool,"It is time for us to get off our collective behinds and Burfoot explains how anyone can run. This book may be the key to a healthy future. Burfoot does not want everyone to compete at the level he did, but he feels everyone has the capabilities of achieving fitness and health through running. Run out and get your copy today."
5,"Ciao, Francesco","This is an inspiring story from one of America's greatest generation. I liked it because it is a story told on a very personal level. It's one person's account, living for months in Italy after being shot down. Very good reading, I think."
4,5 star message with 3 star presentation,"The message in this DVD, reversing diabetes through a raw food diet, is worth more than 5 stars. It may save many lives!Maybe it's just me, but I found the presentation less than optimal. I want to show this to my diabetic friends but am concerned they will be put off by the touchy/feely (""corny""???) aspects, the brief cameos by people like Anthony Robbins, the stress that shocking dietary changes will be demanded, and the suspicion that maybe it is an infomercial for the ""camp"" they attend in Arizona.Again, it's a fabulous message that diabetes can be cured, but I don't think that I can convince any diabetic friend to watch this through. The emotional tone will appeal to some people and repulse others.But do not be put off by this review! Watch it anyway because it may save the life of a loved one!There are no recipes, no ""How-To"" in this DVD. It simply introduces the concept so that you can research it further yourself."
4,Simply Raw is good.,This is a decent DVD that allow you to see changes individualgo through during a 30 day stay at a retreat to learn new eating habitsto reverse diabetes.
5,Raw For 30 Days Review,"This product and it's description is exactly what i expected. the movie does a good job serving as an entry level course in the raw foods lifestyle for diabetics and their families. It tries to do an even job of showing the people and the raw food. The food itself is a member of the cast. This DIE-abetes DVD doc can be viewed as educational, but for me, it is a motivational tool to stay on course with a raw foods lifestyle makeover."
4,A Good Message,A good message for anyone about how diet can make a huge difference. A great message for diabetics. I already knew that a plant based and/or raw diet worked this well but didn't realize just how fast these people were getting off insulin and dropping cholesterol numbers. Very sad to see the native american guy give up. Just remember it is a documentary and not a high cost movie.
5,EXTREMELY INTERESTING,"Bought this to pass on to my daughter who has been struggling with her diabetes. Decided to watch first and it really has me rethinking my lifestyle. I'm making changes in diet and exercise. Not being a believer that taking a pill will solve my problems, I am encouraged with the new/old ideas that we have the ability to change our health and lives ourselves."
2,Poor Quality DVD,The DVD is labled as For Use on All Region DVD players. It does not play on an Australian DVD player. The DVD was loose in the cover and is scratched to pieces. I will never buy a DVD from Import DVD on AMAZON ever again. Total waste of money ! NOT HAPPY....
3,Not exactly what I expected!!,"This software has a lot of capabilities for recording DVDs, but the one main thing I wanted it for and perhaps many others may use it for was to copy DVDs from origin disc to DVD-R. I was not able to do this because the software doesn't allow copying of material with Microvision or other copy right software on the original disc. I thought this software would do just that. Will have to find another software that will accomplish this task."
3,So far so good except the logic of compress,"This DVD copy 2 compress data stream from input DVD when clicking a box of ""Fit to 4.7GB DVD"". The logic of compress islooks too simple. If the total data is more than 4.7GB, it doesn't remove the same bit pattern on the total data but it remove bunch of the same bit pattern from the beginning of the data. Quality should be ahead of performance. Anyway,it ruins the quality of movies too much.The logic of deving DVD into multiple DVDs is OK though."
2,"Now a difficult to read, verbose ""Norton guide""","Peter Notron's SystemWorks 2.0, which is obviously NOT written by Peter Norton, has become a verbose, 500+ page paperback requiring small print because of unneeded cliches, confusing explanations, and superfluous tangents. Most information is there, but the writing style has become difficult to comprehend without sitting in front of ones computer and following it step by step. Let's get back to basic, concise English writing. Unfortunately it is presently the only book available covering this suite."
3,"Product Good, Bottle Awful","The agave nectar is delicious however, the bottle design has something wrong with it. Beware, as you use the product it seeps out from under the cap and you find a sticky bottle and puddle of goo when you go to use it again."
2,"Cute, fun, but broke in 2 days","This toy was so very cute! My daughter loved it as soon as she opened it on Christmas day. Unfortunately it was broken 2 days later. I know it was inexpensive, but it was very disappointing to have it break THAT quickly. You can just push the toast down and ""force"" it to pop back up now that it's broken. But when we first got it, you pushed the lever down and the toast popped up with a ""ding"" when it was ""ready."" Very cute. I just wish it was a little sturdier. I would have gladly paid more for a toy that would last longer!"
5,An excellent recounting,"This is by far the best book on the Army's conflict with Native Americans since ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"". It treats the material as a campaign rather than a series of seperate battles, so that Little Big Horn is treated as part of a whole. The author also describes the personalities and deeds of several Indian characters, not just Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. This is an eye-opening recounting of an important part of US history and a look at one of the greatest guerilla forces ever to wage war against the American Army."
4,"Ahoy there, mateys!","Wow! This was a real challenge to put together - and I'm pretty mechanically inclined. It wasn't difficult, it just took a while. Nevertheless, it's a very well constructed toy (with the exception of the masts that screw together in the middle). We bought it for my daughter's 6th birthday and she loves it! It has wheels on the bottom so she can ""sail"" it all around the house (on the wood floors)...lots of room for imagination play. A little on the pricey side, but I think it's worth it."
4,A story of meeting the world for the first time.,"Buechner does a masterful job of introducing us to the world that we live through the lives of children. In his usually fashion, Buechner takes the lives of people and shows how salvation and grace can flow through them, even though, at times, they are unaware. Treat yourself to a little taste of life, with all of its bitterness and sweetness in this wonderful read."
4,Perfect.,Wonderful addition to my garage. This makes it easy to find any small parts that have been dropped. It gives secure footing on a slick garage floor.
1,Trading on the Harvard name,"I can't believe this book was even published. It is nothing more than another in a long line of ""laundry list"" job search books, including such advice as ""don't be late for an interview"" and ""dress conservatively."" Make sure there are no typos on your resume or cover letter, and SIGN that cover letter too! Not bad advice, mind you, but hardly worth the price. And if you have to be told not to be late and to sign your letters, you are already beyond hope. There are already hundreds of career books crowding the shelves, better written and certainly better organized than this one--which rambles and repeats itself. If this guy wasn't at the Harvard Business School I can't believe this would have ever made it into print. Don't judge this book by its cover--the fact that it comes from a business school doesn't make it worth buying."
2,Fair introduction to the career transition process,This book is a good introduction for new job seekers and professinal who are starting a career transition. The book tend to be fairly academic and away from the practical aspect of the job seeking process. It does a good job on the marketing campaign and provides good advices on the writting of resume.
2,"Good information, terribly written","If you partner with Microsoft in sales, this is a must read. But it's also a maddening read becuase the same topics are reviewed over, and over, and over, and over again. It's like the author had to make a certain word count, so they just kept repeating themselves to make the magic number. I would recommend you digest the material over a period of weeks rather than a day or two. It's certainly not a page turner. . ."
2,a very small stuffed dog for the money,"I received these today as I am ordering my Christmas gifts for my family. I ordered 2 of these for my 4 year old great-granddaughters but they are so small, cute very cute but very small. I read how large they would be but my idea was just larger. Amazon are graciously taking them back and I will buy something else.I love to order from this company because I am not able to get out and walk around enough to buy all these gifts and they always help me out."
5,Cute!!!,My Granddaughters have a live beagle who they love very much. He is old and not doing well and this beagle looks very much like he did when he was young. The stuffed beagle is soft and easy to hold and I purchased one for both girls. I rated the durability in the middle because they haven't had them long enough to judge durability but they look well made to me. I am pleased with my purchase.
3,So cute!,"Bought Bernie the Beagle for my niece who wants a real dog like Grandma has..he bears a striking resemblance! Very soft, perfect size for a child to carry around. Arrived quickly, exactly as pictured. Seems quite durable."
4,High Energy and Great Fun,"The Blues Brothers were a sideline for two very talented men. Their sideline produced some very good blues and some great fun for everyone. Much of this is ""live"" and you can tell how much fun the performers and the audience is having. 20 tracks, Ray Charles, Aretha, Soul Man and a Rubber Biscuit on one CD.Hey Bartender, play that one again!"
4,Great fun !,"The Blues Brothers was the first R-rated move I ever saw. I was about 10 years old. I'm not sure what was more enjoyable, the movie itself, or knowing that my older sister was in a sh**-load of trouble for convincing my conservative parents that it was OK to let me see the movie. I've been a fan ever since.The compliation contains all of Jake and Elwood's greatest hits (although I wish they had included She Caught the Katy). A good portion of this album was recorded live at the Universsal Amphitheatre in LA.Jake and Elwood are an American treasure!Hey, what do you want for nothing? RRRRRRRubber Biscuit?"
1,Like Xeroxing a Monet,"I got the joke of the original Blues Brothers segments on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and I do think that they should be credited with reviving interest in a genuine American art form. But rather than buying this album why not seek out the real deal -- the original versions of these songs which crush these frat boy keg party covers like an elephant stomping a grape?"
1,Not what you probably expect,"Projects BLACK stars on your white ceiling. Maybe I was nieve, but that's not what I think of as a planetarium.Words were blurry unless you were within a couple feet of a wall. Milkyway very hard to see. Basically, everything was out of focus (and there is no focusing).Really disappointed. Fortunately I pulled it out to make sure it worked before giving it to my son for his birthday. It's being returned."
1,What a WASTE!!!!,"What we have here is a very cheaply made 'toy'. It is made of very thin plastic and has glow paint dots in the right areas. When used in a dark room it looks neat, but you don't have any explaination of what you are looking at other than the blurry words projected onto your walls.My child is in the gifted program and I thought this would be a good tool to help teach astronomy. Nope. It broke within a few minutes being in my child's hands (8 yrs old). The only thing it taught my child not to place your expectations too high. To an 8 year old, this can be crushing. :(2 thumbs down! If you buy it, you WILL regret it! Spend a dollar to print out some star maps and go outside with your child. It's a lot cheaper and they will learn more."
1,Waste of money,I don't know if I set my expections too high or if this was just a piece of junk! I paid $45US for this else where and I wanted to kick myself in the rear!Displays shadowy words and stars and the 'handheld comet maker' is even more crap!(p.s use a palm pilot size screwdriver to open the battery door)But the bottom line is I was extremely dispointed and unlike the rest of you I cannot return it because I didn't buy it from this site nor do I live in the US.
3,great for older beginners,"OK, I bought this because I remembered having a planetarium visit as a child and I wanted to relive that a little. Yes, it does only project ""black stars"" onto the ceiling but for the price it is really all you could expect. the ""stars"" are correct and if you have low ceilings it is not so blurry. I was happy with it because I was only curious as to how a planetarium would work. If you want a more professional one you will have to pay maybe $100 more. It provides a good start for getting interested in astronomy. and is handy for taking outside to find stars in your area. I have not listened to the CD yet. (also I did not get mine from AMAZON I bought it localally)"
2,Broke after first use,I bought this for my brother for Christmas. He loved it. The entire family listened to the cd and really enjoyed it. The next day it wouldn't turn on.
1,Broke after I turned it on,I got this in the mail and assembled it and put all the batteries in. It turned on once and my son was excited. I then took it to his room and it never worked again (same day)
1,Who invented this crap!,"This is by far the biggest waste of money! There are no shooting stars like it describes and you can barely see the constellations. The names of the constellations are blurry and we are now using this product as a source of light whenever there is a power outage. Do not buy this product, do not pass go and do not collect $200..... Go straight to jail!"
1,Worthless,"Looking at the picture and description, this item looks almost identical to the National Geographic Star Planetarium that I bought at a science museum. Like all the other reviewers here, I regret my purchase.A real planetarium projector is completely dark except for a few spots of light projected on the ceiling for the stars. This device is the opposite - it projects light all over the ceiling, with spots of darkness for the star. As you can imagine, that ruins the experience. For just a few cents more, they could have made the sphere dark with pinholes for the stars. At least this way, it would have made a cool nightlight.The hand-held ""meteor maker"" is just a flashlight with a couple of filters. Unfortunately, the light is so dim compared to the projector itself, that you can't see the image it projects.I wish I had examined the package more before purchasing it. I guess it just didn't occur to me that something designed by scientists would be so poorly made."
1,Save your money,"I bought the Star Theater as a gift for my son, as he has displayed an interest in the stars and planets.The directions indicated that the Star Theater would work best in a small room with light colored walls. The truth of the matter is that the room would need to be spherical to get a decent display of the stars. In a square or rectangular room, the projected image is so distorted that it is virtually worthless! To top it off, the light bulb burned out after only a couple of minutes of use. This was the worst gift that I bought all year.If you have an interest in the stars and planets, I would recommend that you spend your money on a trip to a real planetarium. I have also found a number of web sites with star maps and a lot of interesting information that were free.This toy was definitely a total waste of money!"
1,Star Disappointment,"I only wish I had read the other reviews before buying this useless bit of junk for my 8 year old son's birthday.<br /><br />Having rushed out in excitement to buy the five batteries required (not supplied - and as AAA's seem to come only in packs of four this was not cheap) the first problem was trying in vain to open the battery compartment on the wand. The screw is so small you need a specialist screwdriver.<br /><br />Never mind - we did manage to put the batteries into the Star Theatre itself.... lights off and .....<br /><br />........ Surely we must have done something wrong? Some black blobs and blurred writing in a dark haze. Is that it? The only bright thing in the room was the light in the middle of the projector. Naively perhaps, we had expected to see something resembling stars (even if they were black instead of white).<br /><br />Do NOT buy this item unless you are ready for a huge disappointment.<br />"
1,Why can't someone make a decent star projector!,"I was looking for a star projector for my son's room and read the reviews on this one...decided not to buy it. I was out at a local store and saw one for $20 and decided to see for myself since I could easily take it back.Like one reviewer said, it projects black spots, not light, star-like spots on the wall and ceiling...who thought that would be a good idea? Additionally, the projection of ""stars"" was blurry, as was the names of the constellations (not that I would want to see the names projected at all).It was also made of a cheap plastic that would not last a week in my 3 1/2 year old's room.I would go on, but then I would start to repeat the other reviews...don't even bother with this one!"
1,Taking it back TOMORROW!,"I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday. I know, it may be kind of young, but she has always been interested in the stars. I thought it would be something educational while also using it as a night light. What a piece of crap! You couldn't even use it as a night light if you wanted! No sooner than I plugged it in and turned on the educational cd that comes along with it, the bulb burnt out! After about 3 minutes it cooled off and came back on again. Then 10 minutes later it got hot and burnt out again! I'm sorry, I don't have the patience for this, after her getting upset that the light kept burning out, she said she didn't want it any more. I'm taking it back tomorrow, and trading it in for the barbie styling head!"
1,Star Theater II - a disappointment!,"My daughter received this gift for her birthday; she was having a science-themed birthday at a museum, so it made sense and seemed to be a great present. I just happened to come across the reviews and am relieved to know that we didn't actually break the machine, as I had thought - the light bulb burned out after one day, and for the small time it DID work, the theater was a blurry disappointment. Reading the other reviews I see that the design is faulty, and truly does not perform to anybody's satisfaction. We have since thrown the theater out, my daughter was not terribly upset as it never really worked anyway. What I think is the worse thing is how much money it apparently was, and I think the person who bought it purchased it at the museum gift shop."
2,Good luck...,"We got it on clearance and I'm certainly glad we didn't pay full price. My son loves it but it's close to impossible to get the thing to actually display clearly on the wall unless you take it out and hold the thing yourself. Also, the bulb went out and it is literally IMPOSSIBLE to get a new one!!! Even though the instructions say that its ""easy to find"", I went to more than a half-dozen of the leading stores (Radio Shack, Lowe's, etc) and was told that not only have they never heard of the type that's required but they can't even find it in their systems to order it!It's fun for someone young but is a lot of work and once it's done, it's done..."
1,waste of money,I saw this product on line and got so excited. I figured for the price it must be as good as says. Unfortunately it is just a worthless piece of plastic that barely projects distorted constellations and falls apart very easily. there were no stars just a bunch of distorted lines and words. I wish I had kept the box so that i couldve returned it because we have not even bothered to use it after the first time since my kids also thought it was stupid. How dare they charge this much money for it. I wish i had seen all these reviews before i purchased it
1,Broken out of the box,"My son received this for Christmas. It has never worked and he was very disappointed by it. I came here looking for another planetarium and noticed that others have had similar experiences. I've decided to chime in, thinking that perhaps if the negative review count is high enough, others won't waste their time and money on this product."
1,Totally Worthless Junk!,Incomplete and inoperable light right out of the box. It's on it's way back. Don't waste your money on this thing!
1,Bad.,"I would not recommend this toy to anybody. Would rate 1/2 star if that were an option. It is highly disappointing. We returned ours. Even our young child was not impressed. 1. The toy projects light, and the stars are just shadows, not the other way around. I feel this is backwards. 2. The light is not very strong, and the constellations and words are fuzzy & difficult to see, even in a small room. 3. The toy runs on batteries instead of electricity, and eats up batteries extremely fast (ours may have been defective, but it only ran for a few hours on one set of fresh batteries, repeatedly). 4. It was fickle. Sometimes it would turn on, and other times it would not. It would work with one set of batteries, but not another. 5. It's an inconvenient size and odd shape for its purpose."
4,Star Theater 2,I got this for my son's 6th birthday and he loves it. My boys listened to the CD over and over and love to look at the stars on their ceiling before bed. Great gift and good educational value too!
1,Not a success,"A huge waste of money. Very cheaply made. It looked much bigger in the advertising. The projected image was very pale on the wall. My kids looked at it, and left the room. If I could have put zero stars for a review this would have been more appropriate. Spend your money on something else.Uncle Milton Uncle Milton Star Theater 2"
2,Star Theatre 2,"I got this for my 11 year old for Christmas. It's a great idea in theory, however when you use it in a room with normal ceiling height the clarity of the stars leaves much to be desired. It would work much better in a small domed tent like they use in the schools. Because of that, my child doesn't really use it since she can't read the stars."
1,"Great Toy, but it Eats Batteries","I got this at a thrift store for only $4.00, and it was worth it - it is interesting and a lot of fun. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, though, because it is pretty flimsey and goes through exactly 3 batteries every 24 hours.It was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter, and she loves it, but we cannot afford to keep batteries in it. Also, for it to work well you need to be in an extremely small room. We use it in our half bath because the ""stars"" don't project well in a normal room.Not sorry I bought it, but it isn't all that great. For $4.00 it was worth buying and fooling around with it for a day, but there isn't much to it and by the time you pay to change batteries over and over again, you lose much of the value of it."
5,Good protector,"Product delivered promptly as advertised. Product by APC has reliable reputation, have had no problems with product."
1,Product stopped working,I have had this product for several years but it stopped allowing current flowing to my laptop. Avoid it like the plague!!
4,The first part is best,"The second part also includes a pre war ceremonial, this had not been used from WW II, and we can see it now, but the first part was better"
1,Don't be fooled.,"The way this movie was marketed makes you think it stars some of MMA's elite. Instead it has breif cameos that makes you wonder what the loser who made this movie is blackmailing them with to get them to appear in it. The fight scenes are pathetic and the ""star"" of the film is worthless. I only spent 99 cents to rent this and it was a huge waste of money, not to mention time. Save your eyes the torture and avoid this piece of CRAP at all costs."
1,This movie made me cry....I miss my $20....,"OK, now I know I've said this before...but this has to be among the WORST movies I've EVER seen. The acting is pitiful, ESPECIALLY the voice overs (since some of the MMA fighters featured don't speak english, or do so with a very heavy accent). The acting is so bad in fact it was almost like a softcore porn movie on Cinemax. The main ""love interest"" looks so trashy, well....I couldn't tell if she was supposed to be a junkie or a drag queen. Before a fight, there's a quick cutaway to a CGI of the octagon, and then a ""Versus"" screen, like watching pre-fight info of a UFC fight, or before the first round of a video game. The fighting is also REALLY badly choreographed, falling short of even the worst Jackie Chan movie.In all honesty, if you ""must"" see an MMA, see Never Back Down.""Never Surrender"" should instead have been called ""Never Direct This Crapfest"""
1,Definetely a low budget film,"It reminds me of those martial arts movies I used to watch when I was a kid that had no story whatsoever and was filled with punching and kicking scenes throughout the movie. This movie is just like that, terrible story and full of fighting scenes that aren't even that good. Even that star playing the role of Diego, who is he? I've never seen him before in MMA. Why is he starring an MMA movie? Moreover, this movie fools you by having top MMA champions on its cover such as Silva, GSP, Penn, and Rampage. I was surprised to see them act in such a low budget film.In conclusion, don't buy this movie. Go watch Red Belt or Never Back Down if you want a good MMA movie."
1,never surrender your money to this movie,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. I love watching the ufc, and after seeing all the fighters on the cover, i BOUGHT (please i beg forgivness) this movie. Make no mistake, i went into it thinking it wasn't gonna be much more than an action movie. It turned out to be much much less than that. As everyone else already said, lots of T & A, terrible writing, acting...etc. Not one redeemable quality to this movie. NOT ONE! I actually lost some respect for the fighters for appearing in this so-called movie. im just gonna tell myself that all proceeds went to some incredibly good charity so that i stop crying myself to sleep for spending money that would have been better spent buying Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles part 2."
1,Possibly the WORST movie ever.,"The movie is so unrealistic and the plot is not set up at all. It feels like a bunch of scenes just thrown together and called a movie. No flow at all, just scene, another scene, sex scene, fight scene, sex scene, fight scene, crap, crap, and more crap. The cameo appearances by the MMA fighters are tacky and have little to do with the plot and just added to the movie for no reason.(with the exception of Heath Herring). I don't usually write reviews but this movie stunk it up so bad, I had to warn others. I didn't even pay for this movie (someone else rented it) and I wanted my money back!"
4,"great, but not sturdy","My 1 1/2 yr old daughter loves playing on the slides at daycare, so of course I had to get one for home. Very easy to assemble...The instructions say 10 mins and it took me 10mins...I dont think it is very sturdy, but it is sturdy enough for a 1 yr old and not a 4 yr old...I feel like the age group should be 1-2 b/c I can definitely see how a 3 or 4 yr old could easily hurt themselves by tiping it over. The rock steps were diffcult for my daughter for like 2 seconds even though I would prefer regular steps. The rock steps definitely requires her to use her upper arm strength. Overall, it was a good choice and I would recommend it to friends with 1-2 yr olds."
3,"Fun, but with a few problems","We ordered this for our 18 month old for Christmas. He has be climbing since he was 10 months old. The slide works great, and he enjoys standing in the tower and turning the wheel. The difficulties come in on the climbing part. This toy would have been better if it had steps instead of the silly ""climbing wall"". It is impossible for my son to climb up unless he has someone help because his feet slip off the grips. It is also difficult for him to crawl through the tunnel because of the high thresholds. I would not spend the money to buy this toy again. I would buy the playhouse climber instead, it has stairs, no thresholds, and it is cheaper!"
2,Poor design,"I wanted a small slide/climber for indoors to encourage my daughter who has become as active as a little monkey. Unfortunately, this item is too small and poorly designed and I put it in the backyard for now.The ledge is too small for her to climb up to and on to without sliding head first down the slide. The final straw though was when she stood on it, grabbed the wheel and started pushing... she was able to make the whole things wobble -- at 12 months.For a small, older child this may be ok. For a large, young child that is just learning how to walk, climb and slide... this is not recommended."
3,unsturdy,"Like most people I did some research to find a good outdoor climber for my son on his 1st b-day and one that wasn't too big so that we could put it in the house in the winter time. Most of the reviews about this toy were good. However, I have found that if I don't hold onto him every min he plays on this toy, he would fall.(back down the steps or down the slide) also the sides are too wobbly and the slide is too steep. I wish I would have seen Step2 Kangaroo Climber before I bought this one."
2,Save your money!,"My 24 month old son just got this as a birthday gift. It's not something I would have bought myself for him, however, it's kind of hard to take back gifts from his grandparents. So I set it up, which is fast and easy, but this is a very lightweight plastic and my son of course had to stand on top of it and grab onto the sides and rock back and forth on it. Not safe at all. If you do get one of these, you must be standing, holding onto the side in the event your child decides to do the same thing! The slide is very steep and it looks very uncomfortable to slide down. My son didn't have any problems climbing up the ""rocks"" or the slide for that matter, but he is quite the monkey, as you can imagine. He doesn't appear to enjoy playing on it as much as other playsets we have been on. So anyway, my point being, save your money for a decent, durable playset and don't spend money on lightweight plastic playsets like this."
4,Great!,"I got this for my daughter for her 1st birthday. It was on sale at Walmart for $[...] :). The box was missing the wheel that's supposed to come with it, and I kept putting off calling Little Tykes about it. It just wasn't that big of a deal. My daughter has played with it a lot since I got it. She's now at the age (2) where she wants the bigger slides, but she still uses this. I'd highly recommend it especially if you can find it for the price I did."
4,Little Tikes Climb & Slide,This toy was purchased for our 2 year old grandson. He loves to climb and slide on it daily. We currently keep it indoors on carpet. It was very easy to put together and has held up well (a little over one month).
3,climber,"I got this for my son who was 15 months at the time. He was trying to climb anything he could and I thought this would be good for him. He does okay with it but has trouble climbing up at times (though I'm sure in a few months he won't) and he likes to stand on the platform and shake the sides. It has held up so far though I check the screws/bolts once in awhile to make sure they aren't loose. Overall, I think this product is good. He is able to climb, has learned how to use a slide and loves playing with the wheel. The size is good too as we keep it in the house. One thing I was not too crazy about was that the slide ""pops"" into holes. We had a hard time getting it to fit and I worried a bit that it would fall when he used it (so far so good at 25lbs)."
2,"Too Small, Too Hard","We bougth this slide for our daugher when she was 1 because she loves the slides at the park. However, I had not idea it was going to be too small! Her feet almost touched the ground when she sat on top of the slide, and I had to help her up almost all the time becasue the 'rocks' are really hard to climb - even though she has been a huge climber since she could crawl! I wish I had spent my money on something bigger and more substaintial. She is two now, and hardly ever plays with it!"
4,Space saving eye pleasing toddler tolerating toy,First off you must know that this is a perfect big ticket item for a small playroom/living room like ours. My little guy is 13 months and not quite able to climb the rock wall yet but loves to hang out underneath the castle like a fort. Plenty of room to play. He's in the 90th percentile for height and the slide is plenty huge... lots of room to grow. A great little investment. One bad thing is on carpet it's light as a feather and gets slid around very easily. Worth the money... especially if tight on space. I think it's ideal for indoor use.
4,Mom's Princess,"This is the best birthday gift a child could ever get from her grandparents! At first she was apprehensive to play on the toy. Once she went down the slide a few times we were unable to keep her off. The ""Princess"" really enjoys playing in the castle."
3,No so Great ;[,I agree. My son is also 2 yrs old and the slide is too short and steep..... and the rock climbing is ok he still hasn't got the hang of this yet..... we are looking to sell ours.... any buyers????
3,About What U Expect for the Price,"While this toy is inexpensive, it shows in the build. The slide is not very sturdy and the photo is a bit eggagerative as I don't see any child being able to climb under comfortably. It has stood up against all weather considering it is hollow plastic but its pretty small so not worth it for kids over 3 unless they are petite."
3,Cute and Cool looking figure,This is not a bad figure nor best figure among my various collection. She has a cute anime looking face and sexy body as you can see. Her hat is being pushed in between her fingers which is little weak. It might fall down if shaked.
4,A good reference,"This book serves as a very good reference for video engineers. However, for a person new to the field of video encoding/decoding, I would not recommend this book."
1,30Day Hormone Plan,"Not a good book....It's more of a cook book than a hormone plan. Too many recipes and too much ""fluff"" and not enough pertinent information. Wouldn't recommend."
2,Very poorly written,I saw the author on tv and bought this book. It is very poorly written and contains nothing new that I hadn't read already in Time and Newsweek.
5,Have not read yet.,Did not read but am interested in a book on Italians arriving in the Port of New Orleans in early 1900 or late 1800. Anything available?
1,This band is the WORST.,"Rip off of Coldplay much? If you don't like Coldplay, let me just say that you may not get through 2 tracks without breaking the cd. If you like Coldplay, then you'll throw up after 2 tracks. I cannot fathom how ANYONE thinks this music is good... but then I realize-- hey maybe these people haven't seen this band live yet. Live they are even more horrid. This is by far the worst band in the world."
1,I do not like this cd,"I bought this cd because it was cheap and it definitely was a waste of money. Many of the songs sound fairly similar. When there is the opportunity to speed it up a bit and make it sound good, they intead slow it down into a boring, repetitive lull. There is no distinction in this band either, nothing catchy that you are going to be humming or dying to hear. They seem to have taken a bit from John Mayer, Coldplay, and Dave Matthews and don't do any of it well."
2,just ok.,"after hearing a few clips of their music on amazon i decided to try out blue merle. the lead singer does sound a little like chris martin from coldplay, but the music does not. overall, the music isn't bad, it just didn't do a lot for me. it was just ok. i might end up playing it in the background in the future, but i doubt i will follow this band."
3,Coldplay Goes to Nashville,"This is a promising debut, all right, and Luke Reynolds' lead vocals definitely fall into the ""achey-breaky"" school that was practically founded by Chris Martin. Some of the songs are memorable, especially the title track, ""Boxcar Racer"", and ""Every Ship Must Sail Away"". And the instrumentation is at times gorgeous, with excellent fiddle and mandolin work; in fact, that's when the band really shines. Steven Harris' production defintiely leaves some Dave-Matthewisan footprints, and that's fine with me, too. So what's the problem? The CD as a whole just doesn't excite me - much of it has a pleasant familiarity and all the excitement of Keane's debut (in other words, capable but not artistically challenging). I'm still waiting for a new band this year that will knock my socks off, and these guys only gave my socks a gentle tug."
2,"Clearly not a reference, perhaps a GUI guide","For a 1,500 page book with a subtitle ""The definitive guide to Win32 API"", I found plenty of holes in the API coverage. It's not even the new additions such as DirectX or TAPI, but also what I would expect to be the core features such as file handling and security features (in NT) are simply not mentioned. Most of the book is dedicated to GUI, printing, etc. While it may be an excellent resource in that area (I have not yet ventured in that part of Win32) it is certainly not a complete overview of Win32 API. If nothing else (isn't 1500 pages too wordy for just the graphical part?), the title is misleading. Be warned."
3,It should have been a better book.,"Good book, but still leaves much to be expected.1. As a book titled, ""Programming Windows"", it's not complete. Read together with books like ""Advanced Windows"", ""Inside COM"".2. Very little mention of NT features, for example MaskBlt, PlgBlt, world transformation, NT 5.0 features.3. Bad programming styles, for example, no C++, not much code reuse, every program has a WinMain and registers a class, no assert, lots of static variables which are dangerous in multithreading environment, no exception handling, only single instance of window allowed because use of static variables, no much const where should be.4. Information not fully updated for Win32 API, for example, use RegisterClass instead of RegisterClassEx, spool file name on p. 599; the warning that you should not delete stock object on p. 162 (which is actually safe in Win32);"
5,This is my best Win32 reference book,"This book is considered as the windows programming bible by many. Sure, you can build applications without all this knowledge with frameworks such as MFC but if you are looking to build a Windows program that do exactly what you want, there is no workaround a deep Win32 API knowledge. This book is a must for all Windows programmers bookshelf.Something you need to know before purchasing this book is that it is very unlikely that the author will update this gem one more time as Microsoft is slowly phasing out the Win32 API in favor of the [...] and this will be even more real when Vista comes out. However, since there is a huge codebase of existing Win32 programs, the Win32 API will certainly stay around for a long long time. This book is simply the best for learning Win32 programming. I still refer to it very frequently. If you are looking for a reference book on Win32 API, this is the one you were looking for."
5,Excellent start for Windows programming,"This book is a great guide to Windows API programming. Beginners can read it straight through (over 1000 pp.) as I did to start out, using it as a rather extensive tutorial. More experienced programmers can read it as a reference. As a reference, it is best used in conjunction with the Platform SDK. This book can provide examples of how to perform many tasks, while the SDK can give terse explanations of the operation of API functions."
4,Great book for beginners...,This book shows basic way to use the Win32 API. If you need to know more you have to search in another books or SDK documentation. It's a good way to start programming in Windows.
2,Nothing more then a reference book,"I have started to program in windows and was hoping this book whould help me with it. Chould I be more wrong?The wrighter sure know how to wright mutch about little, you can read 1 A4 without problems without even see any code, atleast thats what it fellt like. The only thing you actually can use this book to, are as a reference. But then you might consider to check out hte win32 api bible for windows 95 instead, dont bi chocked that it is for win95, it is no big difference and both use C ( not C++), the only difference are that they use cod as example, this guy doesnt"
1,"A bit out-dated, Wait for a newer edition","I think this is a excellent book if you want to learn Windows 98 programming. I think the book is not worth $40 because the book is 6 years old, and the material you learn will be outdated soon. Since Microsoft is going to release Windows Longhorn which will include Avalon, the book will slowly become obsolete. I suggest waiting for the sixth edition that will most likely be released when Windows Longhorn is released."
3,So many words - so little substance,"The book is so full of morsels of unrelated historical data and trivial facts, as well as verbose explanations of things that you never thought about and never will again that, well anyway, perhaps at this point you are starting to get a flavor for what I am talking about when I tell you that the book is a tad wordy. Don't buy this book if you are expecting a technical reference. If you can appreciate some of the background Petzold delivers then the 1500 pages will provide you with a great understanding, and five years from now when all of this stuff is outdated you can start a nice warm fire with it. I prefer a more direct style with diagrams and table references."
3,It's an old book!!,Petzold's book is fine if your are getting into C compilers. The world has grown significantly with object orientation and classes to the newer compilers of C++ and C# I'm sure that Mr. Petzold will write again about the newer genres. It is rare to find anyone outside of Microsoft who might be able to translate Microsoft-eze..cpr
2,Low information content; OK as an introduction,"This book is OK if all you're looking for is a brief introduction to some of the more commonly used parts of the Win32 API.If you want more detail, you'll have to go elsewhere. ""Where?"" is a good question. I'm still looking for a book that covers Win32 GUI programming in any significant depth.This book shows you the simplest and most common ways to use the Win32 API but if you want to know more (like, what are the meaning of all of those flags that you can pass to the functions but that this book talks nothing about?), you're best bet is probably the documentation which comes with your win32 compiler (like MSVC++)."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book after having read the glowing reviews about it. I really didn't like it. I was learning the Win32 API - perhaps the book is better for experienced Win32 programmers. My primary complaint was that, in the code examples, it presented the material it was trying to illustrate alongside copious amounts of material that had never been discussed. The part you were trying to learn was sandwiched among many unrecognizable things. This fact made the code examples almost worthless to me. In addition, the book leaves out the subject of the Windows Common Controls entirely.There seems to be a shortage of good books on the Win32 API. I don't think the Platform SDK documentation does a good job of helping students learn it either. There is another Win32 API book, Win32 Programming, by Rector and Newcomer, that I liked better than Petzold. I also prefer it to digging through the Platform SDK."
2,Bored my child too quickly,"It took longer to get the darn thing out of the packaging than my daughter actually played with it. She is 7 and LOVES horses, but she became bored with this toy within 15 minutes. Played with once and hasn't played with it again since christmas."
2,Disappointed,Baught this for my 8 year old daughter. Didn't hold her interest. Not interactive enough. High priced for the interaction it provides. My 18 month old likes it mor ethan the 8 year old. Highly disappointed!!
2,Failed its saving throw vs. buns of steel,"The little four-bit screwdriving doohickey in this card has come in handy numerous times. Unfortunately, the card itself cracked within a few weeks of my putting it in my wallet; as much as I'd like to chalk its untimely demise up to my fabulous buns of steel, the card's flimsy plastic was probably the primary culprit."
4,swiss card,good piece of kit to have stuffed in a pocket. makes an excellant accessory to a good survival kit.
1,Not worth the money!,"This seems like a handy product in concept but the reality is that I've owned two of these and both have broken within weeks. I thought this would be a great item to carry in my wallet, to have these tools available all the time in such a compact package. I already have a favorite pocket knife so didn't want to replace it with a Swiss knife so thought this would be a good alternative. I guess that it would be if you carried it in a jacket pocket or purse but not in a normal mens wallet."
3,Handy but not the most durable,"Victorinox Swisscard Lite, OnyxIt's quite handy to use however it isn't the most durable while in the wallet. The card will slowly split and will make the tools fall out when taken out of your wallet. If you want to make this last you might not want to put this in your wallet or put it in your back pocket.I learned my lesson after the first time and keep it in my backpack. Otherwise this is a great tool to have on you."
4,almost perfect,"I enjoyed reading this book very much, it has a wealth of information on the development and history of the Churchill, an abundance of photos and quite a few amusing anecdotes.Particularly valuable are the copies of original plans and diagrams.The one criticism I have of this book is that for those interested in the harder technical and production detail what has been included has been scattered through the book in the text, inclusion of appendices like those in the Jentz books on German tanks would have been valuable - collating that data in one spot."
3,Melanie C aka Madonna!!!!,"Yeah she's good and trendy but that's not a reason to copy her!!!Melanie C did, on her latest offering a copy and a blend of what MAdonna and William Orbit sucessfully did accomplish on ""Ray of light"": smooth melody, techno-dance beat and dreamy strings. The production is very good Mel can sing very well and the song is very catchy. But where is the originality????"
5,Different and exciting,"This is a book of advice veiled in the form of a novel. It is refeshing to be entertained while being educated in finance, romance, and life in general. It is a quick read and will keep the reader guessing to the end. I am waiting for the sequel!"
5,Benjamin J. Boodle,"This is an exciting first novel from a writer with tremendous potential for more great work! Excellent descriptions and terrific dialogue, ""Things You Need to Know"" may serve the reader better as a guide for financial success. We need more from Joe Hanson."
3,Defective Product,The product was defective because one of the tracks in the cd doesn't play properly. I am very disappointed with the quality of the cd.
4,Conquest of Soundtrack,"Yes, this soundrack takes me back to the day's of Queen Isabella and Ferdinand. I will never forget the day Queen Isabella appointed me governor of Hispanola."
5,Enchanting,I consider the scores to this movie among Vangelis' finest ever works. The music from Conquest of Paradise will give you goosebumps over and over.
4,My brother has a copy - fantastic,I wonder if yu can send me a complimentary copy - not available here in Malaysia. My brother bought it in USA
5,Drift away,"Pure musical perfection. Simply lie back and feel yourself drift awy into another world, full of adventure and escapism. Vangelis: A Genius at work."
5,Magnificent !,All the praise hailed in the reviews below...(my version doesn't have a 'screeching' guitar ?) The movie was nearly as good - what a story!
3,"Awesome Book, so-so movie","When I read this book as a kid, I absolutely loved it...purchased the book as an adult and re-read it and still loved it. The movie however I found lacking. Honestly, they couldn't find a Husky to play the part? The fact that he is Kavik the Wolf Dog being played by a German Sheperd was very annoying. Anyone that knows dogs and loves dog stories will be disappointed by this fact."
2,Did not work from the moment it was set up.,"This purchase was intended for a home office setup with a single user. Setup was easy as indicated in the marketing information, but from the first test (prior to loading the softward) the paper would not cycle through the printer. Every test page was 'eaten' by the printer. Even loading the software and printing from the computer did not resolve the issue. The packaged diagnostic software was useless in determining the fault. Worse yet, I could not get the pinter to print in color! For both problems I consulted a computer technician and he could not resolve the problem. One can expect an expensive purchase to perform better than this (especially since it was brand new)."
3,"It's not a bad book, but...","It's not a bad book, but Bohjalian's follow-up to ""Midwives"" (a book I highly recommend!) is just that...a follow-up. It seems the author used the success of Midwives as a template for his next novel...alternative medicine plus tragic death equals courtroom drama. It's not a bad equation if you're looking for a simple pleasure read. The character development is still good, although I found the romance a bit trite. As always, Bohjalian backs his words with seemingly decent research to technicalities...I did learn a bit about homeopathy. I hope this talented author will expand his voice and viewpoint for his future works."
3,"Falls short of ""Midwives""","A real fast starter, but the pace slows to a halt and the end is unsatisfying. Far more interesting than the plot is the look at homeopathic medicine of which I was totally ignorant and which I found absolutely fascinating. Not nearly as much action, excitement or drama as ""Midwives."" The character development of state attorney Leland is well done, though. I was disappointed as well in the lack of the courtroom scenes I had come to love from ""Midwives."" Could there be a sequel brewing with the way it ends?"
3,"Quick read, but wait for the paperback!","I enjoyed this quick read. It is indeed a book that, once started, is difficult to put down. For me, however, the novel lost plausibilty somewhere around mid-book and never quite found it again. I do not regret reading the book - not at all - but if I had the decision to make over again, I would wait for the less pricey paperback version. For anyone who has yet to read MIDWIVES, it is a very compelling, thoughtful read."
3,A moment in time can change lives forever,A very interesting book that explores how an instant in time can change a life forever. Leland Fowler turns to alternative medicine after battling a cold that seems to never go away. What he finds is a cure for seemingly all that ails him....even loneliness.....in the arms of his homeopath. The story was sad but interesting and Bohjalian did a good job of helping us to understand a little about homeopathy and how someone can take a single step over the edge that sends them on the path of no return.I do think that the easy wrap up at the ending was a little contrived. It did not seem that Jennifer Emmons would give up so easily. But maybe she came to terms with what happened to husband. He did afterall have a choice in the decision that he made.
2,Not nearly as good as Midwives,"I'm not an expert on homeopathy, but I suspect the author isn't either. This story is told in a disjointed way, with many details missing. The reader is required to believe that a good father, lawyer, prosecutor, and person would suddenly decide to go against all that he knows is right by destroying evidence and living a lie in all aspects of his life. I couldn't believe that Leland would do this, and couldn't understand his reasons for doing it. Carissa Lake was an irresponsible homeopath, but didn't suffer any consequences. All in all, the story was disjointed and unbelievable. Midwives was wonderful, but The Law of Similars is very disappointing."
3,Ho hum homeopathy,"A 3+ really. Maybe even a 4-. This book will keep you entertained if you are rather easy to entertain. I liked Carissa Lake, homeopath and quirky lady. You wish these people well; and recognize the trials and tribulations of living in a small town where everyone knows everyone else's business. Nice portrayal of that life. But somehow the story never catches fire."
2,Slow and Not realistic,"I found the book to be well written but very slow. The story about alternative medicine seemed realistic. What I found to be difficult to believe is that a man, who has seen a woman only a few times, would put his career on the line to falsify records. There seem to be no real evidence against Clarissa even without changing her patient notes. In addition, after a while the dialogue on Leland's infatuation with Clarissa became tiring. I won't read another book by Chris Bohjalian."
2,Disappointing,"A disappointing follow-up to ""Midwives"". The narrator rambled on for far too long and I found the characters unsympathetic. An interesting premise, but poor follow-through."
3,"Well-written, but...come on...","The plot was so similar to that of Midwives that it actually diminished the impression I had of the author after reading the former book! Are all of his novels going to deal with alternative medicine and society's reaction to its practitioners?Also, I have a problem with the sex scene in this book. It's quite disgusting, and so...anatomical. It's like it was written by a surgeon or something. Come on..."
4,A compelling read,"I very much enjoyed The Law of Similars however I couldn't believe that the main character would suddenly decide to risk everything for this woman he barely knows especially without hearing both sides of the story. I also was amazed that he was so ""dim"" that he didn't realize that he was poisening himself with the arsenic he'd stolen. During the first half of the book he is depicted as an intelligent lawyer while during the second half he suddenly begins making very poor choices. It didn't make sense."
2,Not what I had hoped...,"After having read ""Midwives,"" I was looking forward to Chris Bohjalian's next book, ""The Law of Similars."" Unfortunately, it was dull in comparison to ""Midwives,"" a book that kept me so enthralled I practically read it in a single sitting. ""The Law of Similars"" seemed to be too trendy and too slow such that I was almost completely disinterested by the time I reached the middle part of the novel when it became more interesting."
3,The ending fizzled out....,"Enjoyed the first two thirds of the book,but for me the conclusion crumbled....I kept ""waiting"" for some exciting explanation of what the arsenic was actually doing to him, or to discover some other overwhelming evidence against or admission of guilt by Clarissa...or something! I read this sort of book purely for fun, as I did Midwives, yet I would have liked to learn a bit more about homeopathy. Midwives had such a fantastic ending that left me breathless that I couldn't help but be disappointed by the tidy (i.e. boring) ending this time. Also, I'm not a prude but I did not care for the sex scene...it seemed jarring, but maybe that was the point?"
3,He can do so much better,The plot seemed a bit flimsy Many of his books are so much better. I would always look at his latest to see if it sounds good
2,Who's the narrator?,"Even if I could relate to Leland Fowler, I didn't like the fact that he told other people's stories through his own eyes, for example the wife of the guy who slips in a coma. Bohjalian is a gifted writer but this book just didn't move me."
4,4 star review,"I enjoyed this book a great deal, even though I had some problems with the character of Leland, who seemed both admirable and reprehensible at the same time. He reminded me a bit of Lester in ""House of Sand and Fog."" Both are men who seem completely willing to give up everything to protect a woman they've known for an extremely short period of time. Why Leland, a prosecuting attorney would be willing to break the law, thus risking his career, reputation and most importantly, his daughter, to protect Carissa seemed a bit far-fetched to me. Had they known each other longer, maybe I could understand it. I did find the father/daughter relationship between Leland and Abby quite believable and the book did peak my interest in Homeopathy. Also, the story ended they only way I would have wanted it too. A four star recommendation for this one."
3,Captivating read but ethically flawed,"This is the third of Bohlaian's books I've read and I find him an easy and graceful storyteller. As always, the tale and characters drew me and held me wrapt for the length of the book. I was particularly interested in his examination of culpability: legal, medical and moral. That I didn't rate it higher has mostly to do with discomfort over the protagonist's actions. As a lawyer and former prosecutor, I couldn't imagine anyone in my acquaintance so violating the legal canon of ethics. Nor can I imagine a committed and caring single parent traversing a path most likely to lead to disbarment or worse. While it might make for good storytelling, I couldn't empathize with Bohjalian's main character as we are meant to do. Haven't read Midwives yet and wonder if I will have similar issues with that book."
3,The Law of Similars,"I was disappointed in this book. I expected it to be as good as Midwives. I found Midwives believable. However, in The Law of Similars, I could not imagine a man of Leland's caliber putting himself at risk by helping Carissa, a woman,who at the early stage of knowing her, would put himself in jeopardy of losing his license and his job. What I found most disturbing was the way Bohjalian focused so much on Leland's sexual appetite. It really turned me off. I found it hard to get into the serious part of the story when Leland's sexual fantasies came into focus. It was done in very poor taste. I'm not sure I'd want to read another book by Bohjalian..."
2,Not a guy's book,"This is not a guy's boook. The opening is a real downer, which is probably they chose to start the sample pages on page 17. Wish I had read that first, but it was recommended to me by a woman friend. Women will probably love this book, but it takes forever for the author to get into his story, and he is probably the wimpiest guy that ever passed for a hero in modern literature.If you're looking for hard-biting legal stuff, this is not it."
4,Self Same Thing- A Familiar Tune,"Sarah Blackwood, the vocal genius behind this highly overlooked musical quartet, brings to light the exact ""same thing"" that this band is renound for- deeply emotional and lyrical ballads that evoke absolute feeling through song. Unlike many of the other more upbeat tracks on the band's latest lp ""disgraceful"", this ditty reminds us of the slow and hypnotic tunes from their previous albums. ""Self Same Thing"" harps on the common theme that weaves through many of the band's songs, relationships gone wrong. This song is just a sampling of the musical delight we have been waiting for since Dubstar's last release in 1997. Though the new album ""Disgraceful"" falls slightly short of the two previous lps, with it's techo suggestions and mature approach, it's definetly worth adding to your collection."
2,"A decent book, but not recommended.","I consider myself and intermediate user of Excel. I occasionally use macros, but don't venture into VBA. I have had this book for a couple months now and I feel it has 2 serious flaws. I find the examples hard to follow. In addition, the index does not make it easy to find items in the book. I find myself hunting and hunting for information. When I find it, it is not particulary clear. If you are looking for an Excel reference, keep looking. Maybe it is ok if you are more of a beginner, but it labels itself as ""The Only Excel 2003 Book You Need."" This is hyperbole."
2,You get what you pay for,Very cheap knife in both cost and quality. If you really put your back into it you might cut something.
3,"So Far, So Good","A very comfortable bathtub pillow, especially since you can adjust the position of it in the tub."
2,Not what I expected...,"I received the ""white"" pillow a few days ago. It is completely discolored - mostly beige. It appears to have been sitting on a shelf for many years. It is only white in the area that the packaging covered. It did, however, adhere well to my whirlpool tub after a serious sanitization process (hot water, soap and bleach).I should have spent a few more dollars for the better product."
3,Not as big as I hoped,"This Bath pillow was much smaller than I expected. The suction cups on the back can't all hold at the same time, because the tops ones let go when you get the bottom ones to hold."
2,So-so pillow,"This pillow is okay for the first 2-3 months of use. It doesn't slide much and is comfortable to lay against in a bath. After the 3 month mark, it starts to mold from the water getting stuck in the porous cover, even after squeezing it out after each bath. Unless you want to keep buying it over and over again, I would suggest another pillow. :/"
5,The perfect bath pillow,This is the perfect bath pillow.Secure and sturdy it easily stays in placeand doesn't require inflating.
2,popped a hole,"The pillow developed a leak/crack after a couple uses. This caused the pillow to fill with water. When it's full of water it's too heavy for the suction cups to secure to the tub easily. Also, it's kind of icky to leave old water in the pillow, I can just imagine the bacteria and whatnot it's harboring inside of it..."
5,I Play It Again and Again,To listen is to forever feel the world more intensely. I would have been cheated in this life had I missed the experience of this music. Mikis Athanatous!
4,A fitting tribute,"I bought thix album a few years back and I'm still amazed at the quality of the performances. All the tracks are great; there isn't a filler on the whole damn thing.Just buy it, you'll never regret it."
2,Not what I expected,"I love Coby's little DVD player. The quality is superb, so I thought the phone would be a good purchase based on the DVD quality. No, it wasn't. The handset sound is very poor quality, almost like a radio station that isn't quite coming in right. My Radioshack phones for near the same price are much better. I do recommend their little 7 inch DVD player though--that thing is tough. Also for the first time Amazon didn't get the order right - the phone was supposed to be black and was silver which only enhances the cheap look!"
1,The Grey Album,"This is not the blending of the Jay-Z Black Album and the Beatles White Album, done by MC Danger Mouse, that everyone is looking for. This is about eight white guys singing 60's, 70's & 80's hits from other artists. So if you are into that, then buy this, but if you are looking for the now infamous Grey Album by Danger Mouse, continue your search."
5,Elvis,As this is the last of the Southern Sisters Mystery books I was very sad to complete the series. I enjoyed each and every book immensely.
5,Murder Boogies with Elvis,"I love all of Anne George's books. I was born & spent most of my life in Alabama. When I read her books,I can say ""Been there & seen all the things she writes about.When the characters in her book travel, i 've been there too. I live in Illinois now & reading her books is like going home again. If you like a mystery with comedy, you'll love her books. You will really love ""Sister"" & all the trouble she gets into in ""Murder Boogies with Elvis"""
4,Murder Boogies With Elvis,This was typical of Ms. George's Southern Sisters Mysteries. It keep you laughing and in doubt until the very end. It was a real good way to end the series. I will miss her.
4,"I saved this one back, knowing it would be the last...","...and now that I'm done, I'm sadder than ever that Mouse and Mary Alice's adventures are over. I really liked the entire series--it was lighthearted and fun and made me laugh when I needed a laugh, and that is no small thing in this world. Anne George will always have a special place on my bookshelf, and her characters will live on in my mind."
5,More from Sister and Mouse,"Thank you Anne George for more wonderful antics from Sister and Mouse. I laughed out loud and chuckled (as quietly as possible) throughout this book. How could these two get into so many tangles and continue to bounce back? Must be that clever Anne George who writes such personality into Mouse and Sister that I want to know all of them. How will I survive without Anne George's books? I will re-read the others in the series over and over again. These books and the girls' antics do not get old -- I just love reminiscing, don't you? Thank you to Anne George for writing such wonderful books, and thank you to my sister for recommending this series to me."
5,Sisters Books by Anne George,"I cannot go to my grave without sharing the delight I have found in Anne George's books about Murder...., starring the two sisters. I am happy to say that they bear a great resemblance to my sister and I! I have laughed so hard that, yes, I really did wet my pants. But that's not hard to do these days ( I am 64 and obviously not Southern 'cause I just told you my age!). Anyway, I have read ALL of the books. I know because I searched so hard for more that I found out Anne George had DIED! 'Course I was sorry - I mean, real sorry - because by that time, I had gotten addicted to those I have come to consider my true blood sisters! I am so sorry I didn't discover her books before her untimely demise. Maybe I could have convinced her that she owed it to her public to write some more. Anyway, you have a treat in store for you if you like to laugh like I do. Best readings from my house to yours! PRH"
5,Fantastic,I was heartbroken just reading this book knowing this would be the last of Mouse and Sister. Though Anne is gone she will never be forgotten. This is another installment of the Anne George mystery series that is a must read.
3,A systematic approach to communication,"The book presents a fascinating method to create or improve communication with autistic children and other people with language-process limitations. A simple symbol based language is used to gradually grow a vocabulary for exchanging information.As with any communication method within this field, consistency of results are not reliable. But the approach presented is systematic and concrete, not just smoke and mirrors to rise hopes."
2,"Anco aero advantage 24"" wiper",The product is of below average quality. The wiper is very flimsy. The wiper seems unstable when it wipes to the far left (open position) even when it is not raining hard or very windy. My 7 year old oem wipers worked even smoother than these. I would recommend buying another brand.
4,OK but very dry,Could be my fault. I hoped to soak this in water or olive oil to make an infusion. It is very dry and never seemed to soften up.
5,Best Game in History!!!,"This game is definetely the best game I've ever played, it is so addicting you will never want to eat or sleep. Rockstar really did a great job with this. If you thought GTA 3 was good this one will blow you away. The only thing I could say was wrong with this game is that there's not enough missions to play. I beat the whole game in about one month and I'm starting it over again because I liked it so much."
5,easily one of the stweetest video games for PS2,"Vice City rules!!! It Was easily better that GTA3. SCREW CARS!!! GET A MOTORCYCLE!!! and when u get tired of the land veicles take a boat or hylicopter. The missions are great but challenging, AND GUESS WHAT!!! The guy accually talks!!! the game is overall great. my ratings are - OUT OF MISSION FUN - 5/5 MISSIONS - 5/5 GRAFICS - 4/5 OVERALL GAMEPLAY AND FUN - 5/5 if you were a fan of GTA3 and are thinking of getting vice city GET IT GET IT GET IT GET IT!!!"
5,The greatest grand theft auto game yet,This would easily be the best grand theft auto game. The game has many different radio stations and has one that is a talk show that is very funny. The cars are much more fun to drive and easier to control. On the last grand theft auto i got bored and didn't feel like doing missions. But on this new and much more exiting one the missions are intertaning and keep u wanting more.
5,EVEN BETTER THAN GTA3!!,"I can't believe how many improvemnets were made to this game! The game play is so much faster, and you actually get to hear your character talk! It is a violent game, but that's what makes it so much fun! There are so many more cars to drive, boats, helicopters, i could go on for days! The missions are so cool, and you actually can play for hours without noticing. I wouldn't recommend playing around children, there is some foul language. I just wait until my son goes to bed and play! Great game!"
4,Amazing Game,"The biggest upgrade is the picturesque backgrounds and Miami environment. Amazing details. The missions get fairly hard quickly ( see helicopter mission). But, the chainsaw missions might be the most fun I have ever had playing a video game. Amazing fun.The only gripes I have, are the load times when you enter the buildings. And it seems like the adult content could have been suggestive and more adult. I would suggest two versions of GTA5, a Mature and an over 18 only version with nudity, sex, rapes, etc."
3,A Little Vulgar,"Okay Vice City is fun and all, but it's also very dirty. I've never heard such foul language (everything but the f-word) in a video game. Sheesh! And the sexual content? It's boderline pornographic. ""Adult Star"" Jenna Jameson has a voice role in Vice City, playing herself basically, with all the fake orgasms that goes with her. I'm not kidding. Parents keep your kids away from this one. And those of us who are over the age of 17: Buy at your own risk."
5,Grandtheftauto 80's style,"First of all, the controls will take a while to get used to. After that, the game is so much fun. So much to see and do, you will neverget tired of this game. For those people who always wondered what it would be like to simply go out and create mayhem and destruction.This is the game to buy this year."
5,OUTSTANDING!!,"You don't even have to play and still have fun riding around on a moped or motorcyle listening to back-in-the day music.Big hair,grandmaster flash and disco music...what more could you ask for??"
5,BEST GAME EVER TO COME OUT,"This game is really cool motorcycles,porches harley's it's so cool at night if you go into the water a shark will attack you it's kinda funny and if you go to the golf place you can find alot of weapons you can drive a hearse ..."
1,... Don't buy it...,"what can I say, it's just like the old game. BORING after 10 minutes!Don't buy it."
1,Nightmare Maker,This game done gave my son nightmares about killin things. I bought it for him just Thursday and every night so far he comes into my room cryin about him shootin civilians in his dreams and this boy is 14. If I was you don't go wastin your money on this here nightmare makin game unless you won't you or your relative go around cryin all the night long. So don't waste your money.
1,Horrifying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst video game on this planet. Millions of kids love this game yet it is putting terrible thoughts into their heads. If your friends are telling you this is fun... IT'S NOT! You go around killing people. Their's plenty of material in this game that is not suitable for children. That's why it's rated M but still kids are buying it! This game should be rated A (adult). Overall it's a pointless, stupid game that is terrible. It's a waste of your time and money."
4,this game rocks!!!!!!,"this game is one of the best games in the PS2 , but im sure that it would be the best game if it had more freedom , like , if you can enter to much more buildings , hotels , and houses , and instead of that, this game is to much better than the getaway , and thats why i give it a 5."
4,A Great Game,This game is fun with great graphics. The game has detaill from charactors names to a piece of clothing. You start from scratch trying to get the money back but when you complete it you own the whole city.
4,"2 Words: Amazing; Oh wait, That was 1","This game is da BEST! Stealstealsteal, the life on Tommy Vercetti, and of mine on this game, PS2 Game, but BETTER THAN XBOX GRAPHICS!!!! I'm 13, but I Highly reccommend it to any crazy gamer, weither your 5 or 60 years old: THE FUN DONT STOP! This game features over 20 Hours of recorded music on 10 different radio stations, you get far over 20 weapons.... AND MORE!"
4,grand theft auto vice city,when i first got gta vice city The game is very intersiing its a WHOLE LOT BETTER Then Gta3 ITS LIKE A GTA LONDON CANDA THING ITS VERY FUN STEAL CARS MORE GUNS NEW CARS NEW PEEP'Z IN THE GAME ITS A WHOLE NEW GAME i injoy every secend of it how ever gta3 has somethings in it that gta vice city does not i injoy the new missions with fmv's and faster loading time and less saveing so buy this game and add it to your gta3 CRAZ!
4,This game sucs,This game needs to be in the classic veiw like grand theft auto - the origanal. I just don't get wie people like this game in 3d. It just doesnt make sence too me. It doesn't deserve to be called gta becouse it isn't in over-head view.
1,worse than GTA 3,"The hype for this game is not to be believed. The frame rate is slow, the graphics are the same as GTA3 (not great) and the vehicles, though plentiful, are based on the same physics models for the previous title. Yeah you can ride motorbikes, but so what? The game is the same as GTA3, only difference is a different city layout and a few more vehicles."
3,Games looks great but could be better!,"I think the GTA games are great and Vice City looks to continue that trend. However I think the game developers are being held back by not being allowed to produce the game for PC or XBOX where more advanced graphics can be used. I felt the PC version of GTA3 looked a lot better than the PS2 version. The reason for this is simply that the graphic system in PS2 can't even compare to what's in the XBOX or a PC, plus they both have internal hard drives. So in conclusion this game could be a lot better if it where produced for the PC or XBOX because of the superior graphics system.I am not a PS2 hater but I know a lot about computers and graphic systems to tell you that the PS2 is inferior to its competition. I will admit the PS2 games have better game play right now and I am sure that Vice City falls into this category, but don't expect XBOX not to catch up at some point. This is probably the reason SONY locked up the GTA games only for PS2."
5,Grand Theft Auto: Vice City? oohhh sweeet...,"i'm a huge fan of the notorious GTA series, especially GTA3. i've beat the game and i wondered: ""is this the end of the line for the GTA series?"". well my friend i was wrong. a new GTA taking place in florida in the '80s (""Miami Vice"" anyone?) with badder cars, weapons, boats, and oh yeah, HELICOPTERS!! i'll tell ya, this is gonna be one hell of a game."
3,"It blew me outta the water, before it pulled me back in!!","The idea of killing pedestrians and stealing cars really appealed to me, as it would to anyone with a brain! Or should I say, any 'man' with a brain?! After a while, though, the game becomes lifeless and wooden! Still, for the first 40 minutes it's a great laugh! Go around knocking people over, shoot whoever you want, pick up whoever you want! After 40 minutes the novelty wares off, and you realise that GTA is just **** glossed over. The citizens constantly shout out the same abuse: ""JACKASS"", they say, ""MORON"" they say. They look unrealistic, stupid, and badly animated! They move unrealisticly. They react unrealistically. I mean, you can shoot directly at small groups of people and they won't run away, even if one of them get's killed, they just carry on their conversations like gormless idiots!"
2,More of the same,"Vice City is basically GTA3 with 80's music and a more involving storyline thrown in. In fact, if you took away the 80's music, I think most people would agree that there really aren't enough new GAMEPLAY elements to justify an entire new game.This should've been a GTA3 expansion pack or more accurately, ""Grand Theft Auto 3.2"" on sale for [...]."
5,Police chases are fun,"Grand Theft Auto Vice City 4.75 starsThe Grand Theft Auto series' best feature, in my opinion, is the ability to get into semi-realistic police pursuits. The missions are fun, but childishly exaggerated. The only problems I have with the game are (1) The manufacturer set the ""trails"" option default to ""on,"" making the game look like a cartoonish nightmare, and (2) The police only chase you, even if gang members are beating up on people right in front of them."
5,"Violent, but fun.","Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is by far the most entertaining and amazingly meticulous video game I have ever played and of course is my favorite. On the other hand, it is exceedingly violent and has scores of drug and sexual references. Last but not least, there is the constant flow of swear words. I must say, however, if one is mature enough then there should not be any problems."
4,wow,"This was an excellent game.I liked the way it started, it is based on scarface.The music was the best i especially loved i ran, from a flock of seagulls.But the only problem was that the cars weren't realistic.Othyer than that this is a must have video game."
5,this game is like that,"when i first got this game I was like whoa this grand theft auto vice city is way better than GTAIII. I say this because the city is so big. You have so many places you can go for insane you could go to the mall and buy clothes from gash(gap) or you can just mess with the fake seceruity guards.On vice city when you do the bank job unlike GTAIII you really go in the bank and rob it, not just wait for the people to come out. This one is also better because you can go to the club if you just want to chill or once you buy the strip club you can go there and see some butts bounce up and down. So all I'm saying is that grand teft auto vice city is the best game ever. This game is on point if you like a challenge.//"
5,The Best Game Ever!!!!!,"Its got Helicopters, Motorcycles, Tons of cars, and after you beat the game you win a helicopter with missles and can go as fast as the planes. You can buy property and take over a giant house, Tons of fun its the best I promise. Buy it you will love it."
5,An excellent game everyone will enjoy,"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, aka Vice City is an excellent game for anyone looking to shoot, reek havic and turmoil, and take out anger. Overall, there's just no losing in this game. Game cheat codes aren't that bad either. There's always something to do in this game so it keeps you on it for hours at a time. I would this game to anyone. You can pick up prostitutes on this game, which might make it unsuitable for some customers. But overall, if you are mature to get over that aspect of the game, the rest of the game, 99.99% of it is excellent...."
1,INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN,"As a school counselor of 3-5th grade age, I am appalled at how many of my students aged 8-10 are playing such a violent game that includes killing police, going to strip joints and being porno directors. None of your reviews give parents any clues as to how inappropriate this game is for chilren. As far as I can tell people disregard the age guidelines. PLEASE include a more direct warning for parents."
5,A cool game,"Grand Theft Auto Vice City is 1 of the best games created. Rockstar should be very proud of this. Anyway, Vice City is not a very good game for children but Im only 11 so who cares. This game also is good even if ur parents wont get it for u. It does teach u a lot about gangs and cops and robbing. This game will teach u a lot about being a car theft. So have fun.(I also have a good cheats web site super cheats)"
5,Grand Theft Auto:Vice City,This game sounds so cool.My favorite part about the game is everything! Great job rockstar games.KEEP ON MAKING THOSE GREAT GAMES!!
2,early reviews,"It annoys me that people continually write reviews for games that they have never even played or seen. Hhow do you know the game is going to be good? Take a look at the reviews below and you'll find text like ""GTA 3 was cool so i ASSUME this will be too. I've never played it or seen any screen shots, but it will be awesome so I am giving it five stars based on nothing other than gta3."" You realize that it affects the overall customer review average, and if the game comes out and isn't that great, the review average will be higher than what it should be because of people writing reviews way too early. Wait until the game comes out and you've played it to give your opinion on it. It makes no sense in wasting people's time and possibly money by doing this. I myself believe this game will be great and i will buy it as soon as it comes out, but i am not going to give it a 5 star rating just because i think that...what's the point?"
1,Some adVICE about Vice City,"Don't believe the hype, this is basically just another race car game with occasional fights and some mediocre cinematics. The world (the city in the title) is pretty extensive and you can roam where ever you want, that's cool. But to accomplish the tasks assigned to you, you're basically doing more of the boring old race car garbage. You're either chasing or being chased. Pretty uninspired, but that seems to be the threshold to which game developers aspire.Save your money. If you don't own an Xbox, get one and buy Halo, Oddworld, and/or the sequels to these games (which have some actual creativity behind them)."
5,Lets get down to business!!,"I'm not gonna waste your time, or my own. If you like GTA3, you'll love this game. Same basic gameplay, same basic graphics, but a whole new level of disturbing the peace and commiting crime after crime. More fun, because there is simply more to do. Buy it or leave it, I don't really care. Oh, and for the people saying that children shouldn't play this game because it's ""too violent"", just remember, it is NOT what the child watches or listens to, it is whether or not the parents explains the difference between ""pretend"" and ""real"". Your parents obviously didn't."
5,PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT MAKES SOME GAMES BAD..,"GTA:VC is a perfect example of what makes BAD games.* Choppy movements. Tommy Verceti's movements on foot are horrible.* Cheesy animations between missions. Characters are drawn horribly, with arms that look like flippers.* Horrible artificial intelligence. Cops pursuing you will just as likely kill each other before getting you.* Horrible physics. You can jump from a 200-foot building and live, but if you fall into three feet of water you will drown.And so many more examples.NOTE: I said this is what makes SOME games bad, BUT ....THIS IS WHAT MAKES GTA:VC SO GREAT!All of the above examples almost seem like they were intentional in the game. They are part of the humor.This game simply ROCKS."
3,Fun but sometimes I wanted it to become something different,"Nothing is funner than cursing, shooting and running stuff over unless that's all you've been doing for hours and hours. THis game is fun when you can actually get into the storyline, but sometimes it just feels like all you're doing is the same thing over and over.Hey I like using a samurai sword to cut up gang members or deliver pizzas as much as the next person, but I wanted more out of the game."
3,Too much work to be fun,"On the upside, the scenery, the variety of vehicles, and the story line and main missions are all great. On the downside, the radio stations in Liberty City were great satire and music, in Vice City, they're annoyingly silly with bad music; the side missions are too difficult, especially since the cops are so easily offended, and the controls seem harder to use (maybe just me and my computer).If repeating the same mission over and over and over and over trying to be a-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y perfect just to get that last checkpoint is fun for you, then go for it. It wasn't for me."
5,Its GTA isn't it?,"Personally i don't see how these people can write a review on a game they've never played and won't play for anothet two months. I mean seriosly who is anyone to rate a game, and it be posted as a review if we've never played it. thats ...But since it is GTA the game has to be awsome"
4,This Game IS THE BEST!,"This game literally blows all others out of the water. It kicks some serious ... and packs a ton of punch. For those of you who dont own (or have never played the game)you must buy it NOW! Im serious....... this game is going fast, definetly th hottest PS2 title EVER! It is especially fun chopping up those who stand in your way with the all-mighty chainsaw...... but for those looking for less blood..... you can take some brass knuckles and kill a cop. Or a hooker. Or a drug baron. Whatever. You can annihalate all those in your path with a mini-gun, or take over the military base with a rocket launcher. If you can think it, you can most likely do it in Vice City. A definete must-have game for all PS2 owners. Cant wait till San Andreas! PE@CE"
5,A game with everything!,"This game has money, weapons, cars, motorcycles, buldings and clubs that you can buy. This is defenetly agame you will want to buy."
5,Just Worth Noting...,"Somebody below mentions that things get blurry while driving about, which I found too.Oddly enough, you can turn 'Blurs' off under the display settings.Hey Presto! Crystal clear!Think it's supposed to be cinematic, but 'off' by default would have made more sense."
4,Vice City surpasses GTA III,"I bought this game with the expectation that it would play like GTA III 1.5. This is the most fun I've ever had being wrong. The gameplay is simply amazing, not only can you drive cars and boats, now you have access to 4 different kinds of motorcycles and planes and helicopters. The controls for the flying vehicles are slightly awkward initially, sadly, the controls for the boats haven't improved from GTA III. Still, that is my only complaint with this game. It once again has side missions, such as the hidden packages, fire, taxi, vigilante and ambulance. It now also has new side missions including pizza delivery. The weapons array is also far more varied, including chainsaws, machetes and miniguns. Do yourself a favor, buy this game, take a week off from work or classes and stock up on caffeine. You won't regret it."
5,"Ah, the moonlight...","I feel romantic, driving through the city in the rain with the moon in view, Emotion on the dial. I'm ashamed to admit I spend most of my evenings helping the coppers chase down wannabe's in front of the mall, 50 bucks a pop for a citizen's arrest and I just keep kicking em while they're down, cha-ching! I've bought all the properties with just the results of my do-gooder vigilantism. See, this game rewards a higher sense of morality."
5,Way better than the 3rd!,"This game is bigger, has more weapons, and more things to do.You'll find yourself up late at night doing missions and killing people.5/5"
4,is a good game but san andreas is a whole lot better,this is a good game but isn't anything compared to san andreas.san andreas has triple the area of vice city and gta3 put together. but there is still alot of things to do in vice city so it was ok for the time it came out.
5,Put this one on your Christmas list,"If you only have a PS2 and one game, it should definitely be this one. I've played this through 100%, and enjoyed every minute of it. Even though I have nothing left to do in the game, I still play it because the point of this game is to roam freely around Vice City doing whatever you want. It improves everything from GTA3, from cop chases to the targetting system. You can now go inside buildings like a strip club, malls, and a dance club. The one downside to this game is the graphics, they're pretty much the same as GTA3 except for the lighting effects, those are really cool. Plus, you'll be so involved in this game that it feels like more of an experience than a game. Don't pass this game up, it's the best that PS2 will have in awhile, and more than the best X-box or Gamecube WILL EVER HAVE!"
4,Now This Is Fun.,"I've always been a big fan of all the GTA's. This one is by far, the best they've come up with. True to it's nature, it's pretty violent... even more so than the last (GTA III). The graphics are great and so is the sound. This game is worth every penny."
5,Don't listen to the old people,"Hey listen this game rocks! I rented it and the best part is the motorcycles lol they're awesome. Oh yea and this time its not hard to find a good fast cool lookin car, but u have to look for those motorcycles. The map is hard to read but who cares your in a city thats all you have to know. It is a lil fruity though. many things are pink i dunno why it just is. The girls in this game are also alot betta hee hee. The police can bust you easier but gangs can help you if u figure out how and the people talk and say many things. And the guy actually has a face! But we could work on how he dresses. Trust me get it, but first rent it and see what you think. I'm 14 not 12"
5,8-ball is the name,"this game is 5 stars.This is a must get for people who love GrandTheft Auto 3.Rockstars have out done their selves.I know this will be the number one game in America.Honestly I hope that theycome out with another Grand THeft Auto.I heard that Max Pane didn't have nothing on this game.To all you game lovers out thereget this game,befor it sells out.This game has more weopons missons women and people....So the only thing to do is get the game!"
3,Vice City the greatest game ever?,"when I first started playing this game I thought it was best game ever , with the 80's cloths , music , cars , hair styles I thought it was a totaly cool retro game , but then I started playing the game , and realized the graphics were horribly bad and in some cases worse than GTA3's , the music is awesome , and the voice overs are sweet but the mission are easier than any game out there I think you will be able to breeze through this game in at least 2 1/2 days if not sooner.the game is being called the greatest game ever ? is this true , I think not I think there is one game out there better and more of a chalenge and it is the Getaway."
2,Horrible Game,"This game was fun at first, but after a while it became boring. Killing the same people over and over again just isn't what it was it Grand Theft Auto 3. Although I don't play this game anymore, I'll give it a 2 because it was really fun for about a week."
2,VICE CITY WHO RESIDENT EVIL RULES,"THIS GAME NEEDS TO GO OUT LIKE THE NINTENDO 64. By now I thought for the 4th installment graphis will improve like the great resident evil, silent hill, devilmay cry and so on. If you want to shoot Pigs a.k.a cops, or humans, buy resident evil 3 zombie pigs everywhere at leats your not killing live pigs. This game over all is not a worse game but it doesnt deserve to be the game of theyear. give me a break. If looking for a challenge lots of guns/ graphics buy resident evil 0. Dont recommended. flush down the train"
3,GTA3 was Better,"i think that gta 3 was much better than GTA: Vice City....For example in GTA3 it was in the present and it was a little easier to find ur way around the cities. GTA Vice City isnt that bad i mean i do like the motorcycles and how u can buy houses and change clothes. but it wasnt as fun as the third one. i hope they make another GTA but i think it be cooler if they had rain, snow, sleet and all that mumble jumble and it should be in the present again and some of the things in vice city included. PEACE"
1,F***in' awsome!!!!!!!,"This game is just TOO cool! I've bought it with my dad and we both LUV it!!! The problem is, me and my dad die literaly TOO much! That's why I always keep a machine gun on me because people jack my car. So whatever you do... BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,READ THIS!!!AN EXPLANATION WILL BE GIVEN PARENTS!!!,"Ok,to much has been said,I would know what its been like not been able to have this rad game.''the hookers the language''STOP!NO PARENT KNOWS UNTIL THE GAME IS TRIED.1.The hookers.YOU DONT HAVE TO PICK THEM UP IN YOUR CAR OTHER THAN THAT THE DANCE CLUBS YOU DONT SEE ANYTHING JUST PRESS X AND SKIP THE SEEN IF YOU LIKE.2.THE LANGUAGE.NO ''F WORD'' IN THIS some other language is used but not wose than some pg-13 movies.My point is,i am 12 and it took practically 1 year to get this,and I love this game.Parents,please if your kid wants this they should have it.Your being good parents to be protective,but its ok,I sware.The violence is nothing how fake.The game is just fun.I hope this helps you kids.Good luck."
5,Vice City is a must have game,Vice City is the greatest game ever both on the Xbox and PS2. If you own either one of these systems this game is a must have for your collection.
4,Classic PS2 Game,"Despite all of the controversy over its violent content, the Grand Theft Auto series of videogames deliver time after time with the best entertainment bang for your buck. In my opinion Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is the best game out of the series so far. Yes, the missions are a bit easier than those in San Andreas, but Vice City is a better overall experience. The setting is beautiful, there are more properties that you can own, and the automotive,firearm and weapon selections are also quite large. The soundtrack to this game is amazing. From 80's pop to metal to old school rap and hillarious talk radio, its all here. Grand Theft Auto is the greatest videogame series ever because it combines fun, challenges, and elements of real life triumphs and consequences in one well produced package."
3,Not a real review,All I want to say this game is ok and people who say it is not for kids must not see the M writen on it!I've played it a couple of times and it is not that bad.It's for adults and older teens.
1,Sucks,This product had tons of scratches on the disk wouldn't even play on the system correctly. Absolutely horrible product to consider purchasing.
3,80's Baby,I was a teenager during the 80's so the game is very nostalgic I even went and got Miami Vice season one after playing this game. It is old and on the PS 2 but even the teenagers enjoyed playing it.
5,Freaking fun,"this game is basically hours of driving cars, stealing cars, picking up skanky hookers,Blowing things up anall else... its like living in the streets of LA, Thugs, theves, etc.. soo fun i could play this game for 8 hours solid and not get tired of it.. Definatly not for children, its actually not soo bad i think it should be rated teen cause heck we see worse then that in school.. if parents saw what went on in high school/jr high, they wouldnt want us here anymore... :) Buy the game its f'n awesome"
5,Let the Thieving Begin!,"Airplanes! Helicopters! Screwdrivers! Chainsaws! Samurai Swords!!![...] What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? Yes, the hooker trick IS back... in case you were wondering. Don't be surprised, after playing this game for the many hours you WILL be playing it, that when you're driving to work or some such place in your life, you'll begin to see possible jumps and ramps that you can hit for insane stunt bonuses. Bottom line, I love it... my wife hates it."
2,"Its fun to play, but that's a scary thing","The game is fun, yet its sick and twisted at the same time. Its scary to think pulling some guy out of a car and beating him to death with a bat could be fun, or blowing off a hookers head with a combat shotgun. I'm in my thirties so I know this crap is make believe. I am not that sure some of these kids out there are that smart to understand that. Kids now a days do some sick and twisted stuff, like go on killing sprees at school. The game is fun to me but I totally think its warping the minds of our youth so I will only give it a 2 for an overall rating but a 5 for the fun factor."
5,Wow!!!,Great game fun for really should be rated for Teens. Gameplay good but graphics need help. Really good but needs more places to go for begginer players. Starty guide is great for this game hopefully will help gamers finsh game complete 100%
5,A most awesome game,"This is one of the most awesome games. My friends and I will end up spending the entire afternoon watching each other play. It is absolutely hilarious and there is so much to do in it. The graphics are great, all the cars & vehicles rock, all the other charcters in the game are very amusing. This game is the only reason I went out and bought a PS2."
4,Motorin',"Mixed review for a great game. Better than the previous version in some ways--e.g., more star power, better cultural acumen--but the game itself, by virtue of being a rerun, doesn't always seem to measure up. The car radio is a blast."
5,Simply Awesome,"Like playing Miami Vice, Goodfellows, The Godfathers, and the Sopranos all at once! They topped GTA3 easily, it will be harder for them to follow this one up.Lets hope for one based on the Roaring '20's!"
5,"Buy the game it is fun, educational, and durability is great","I personaly think that the game is great and worth the money.It is a 5 star game.The graphics are amazing,it is fun,and the durability is great.It is also very educational for children.So take it from me if you own a PS2 buy the game it is great!"
5,Everything GTA 3 is and more!,"What is the matter with these people?! How can they slam Vice City like that? Everything and anything you can't do in GTA 3 you can in Vice City! So what if it's the 80's???? It was a hell of a decade! And plus, the main character is a badass who can actually speak, not some nameless mute who nods whenever he's spoken to.The only thing I regret about both GTA 3 and Vice City is when you plunge into the water, you can't swim to safety."
4,it good but no so,there is glitches in the game. to many to call. but gta3 is still a good game. the new cars are awsome.
5,Addicted to this Game!,"I don't understand how anyone can think this game EVER gets boring (as I've read in many reviews). I've been playing it for 4 months (have beaten main storyline, but have yet to reach 100% completion), and am STILL having lots of fun with it. A lot of the missions are hard, but that's part of the thrill. How much fun would it be if you could beat them all on the first try? As for the violence, sex, drugs, etc.... most people have seen plenty of that in movies and TV. The only bad thing I can think of is that the graphics are a bit cartoonish for PS2. I've seen games that look much more realistic. Everything else about this game is great! The music is nostalgic, the dialogue is hilarious, the missions are intense, and the extras are a blast. I can't stop playing this game!"
5,The best,It is the best 5 0f 5 no doubt. nI havent found a flaw yet. its way better than gta3. it doesnt leave out anything. the sound track is cool it has stuff from the 80's. Look the graphics are better than the last. Now u can own buisnesses and actually use the money you get. you can fly helicopters. u can do events in the stadium. laslo is back on a station called vrock. there are more weapons 40 i htink i think there are 140 cras. there is a golf course. u can go in buildings. there is a rifle range u can shoot at. there is street racing.the water actually moves. the main character actually talks. u can fly in a plane better than the dodo. and there is a sea sparrow when u get 80 hidden packages it lands on water. there is so much cool stuff about this game i suggest you buy it if u havent yet but of course everyone probably has bought it!
5,"THE BEST GAME,HONEST!","Hey,this game is just mind blowing! It is almost Perfect(no games are)You can do almost just about anything on the great game! I am a very big Grand Thft Auto Fan. I think they are very good games.Anyways The resons why I LOVE this game:-You get to ride moter bikes-You can fly ARMY hilocopters,regular Hilocopters,& a sea plane.(these are very easy to fly)-You get to buy your own Condos,Hotels,& buisnesses!-There are WAY more guns,you even get a chainsaw & knives!-This time your character talks.-The there is bedder graphics.-There is more movie playing time.-GREAT MUSIC!!-You can go into alot of builings!-There are Night-Clubs,& STRIP BARS!!-& soooo much more I can't even name them all!!You should really get this game,it is GREAT! You will play it forever!!...-Andy"
4,GTA III Without The Edge,"This game basically sticks to what made GTA III such a popular game plus a few xtras like motercycles, being able to buy new clothes/apartments and being able to go into a few places. However it lacks the destructive and violent edge of a real city that GTA III had. Dont get me wrong its a good game, but there is better."
4,the BOMB!,"When i first played this I knew i fell in love. The wide open area, story, cars, weapons, ever thing was perfect. I mean its not everyday u play as a 2 bit criminal taking over a humongeous city filled with crime.There is a large variety in cars and weapons each with its own cababilities. the only down fall was the graphics and the killing. The graphics were blaw and not so detailed as I would hope for. The killing was faky and unrealistic though funny at times. Other than that I can not complain so i give this game a 4 star."
4,Death !!!!!!! everywhere and I love it!!!!!!!!,"This game is so much fun. all you do is get cheats off the internet and start causing chaos. it takes a very long time to get bored of this.The only real bad thing about this is all the bad language and the hookers it just makes it inapropriate for young kids. if they took out the drugs,strip clubs,and foul language then this game could be played around 12 year olds.But if youre playing around young ones its easy to avoid all that stuff"
3,Big deal,"Ok, what is the big deal with the grand theft auto series. With a bland story line, boring missions and very very repetitive game play, how did this game every make it to the top. Ok, so you can go any where and do anything. I'm sorry, but this gets very boring. I can only shoot people so many times before i get tired of it. The game does have graphics and a good sound track going for it, but those are about the only redeeming factors of this game. Yes, it was fun.....for about a week, but this isn't a very good game to keep my attention for to long, the basis of the game has POTENTIAL, but with current video game technology where it is, this game falls very short. As soon as i can interact with everyone in the world in a meaningfull way (not just shoot them), and maybe throw in some nice massive online support, then we'll talk. Simple things amuse simple minds."
4,"Elaborate and often very fun to play, but way too hard.","There's a whole city to explore between missions, and you can take as much time as you want to cruise the streets and raise hell. This game can get very addictive, but...It's often annoyingly and excessively difficult. The weapons controls are very counter-intuitive and, even when mastered, often don't work very well. On many missions I have had to play it over and over, maybe 20 times, before I succeeded. On some I had to use the ""slow game"" cheat code to beat it. I've never had to do that on other games.I do recommend this game, but prepare to be annoyed!"
3,This game was good but...,This game was good but I think it was a little overrated one thing i didnt like about it was that it was too small of a city in gta 3 at least the city was big and you could ride around after you were done beating it.
1,For shame!,"As a first grader yet to see his seventh year, I was frankly appalled at the gratuitous violence of GTA:VC.I received the game in error - it was intended for my 17 year old brother(there was a mixup; he recieved a ""Fairy Oddparents"" game or some such that was inteneded for me). Such mishaps are doubtless common enough.Moreover, the age recommendations on the game boxes are simply recommendations - they are not legally enforcable age restrictions.At the tender age of 6, I only hope that I have not been scarred for life by this."
2,It dropped,This use to be my favorite video game in the whole world i have had it for a year 100% completed it and now there is nothing left to do and the game is now really boring and i havn't played it for over a month
1,shame on the manufacturer,The manufacturer should be ashamed of this product. It isn't just a game. Kids are playing this game and not even realizing the long-term damage it is inflicting on them.
1,Why o why,"I went over to by former friens house for school work and he letme play it. I must admit it is very fun but, is not the christian way. I dont understand why my generation is entertained by this trash.I am not a parent but i hope you will understand my christian viewGraphics are okHere is the bad part (i am 15 doing the kid review if thats ok)Stealing carsKilling peoplerobbing peoplenudity(women topless)and worseNOT THE CHRISTIAN WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,O.K. IF YOU CAN GET IT TO WORK,i bought this game thinking it would be the best ever but after two dAys of playing it everytime i put it in it said disc read error and the disc wasnt scrached at all so i bought a new ps2 and the first time i popped it in i was in the game and it said error reading grand theft auto vice city disc so i took it back got a new gta: vice city game and it still wouldnt play my final say good game if you can get it to work
1,Stick with James Bond,"My friends told me this game wa sgoing to be good so i bought it instead of james Bond NightFire. I hated Grand theft Auto vice city. I think its violent,immature and wrong. I cryed when i played this game because hit hurt me as being a Italian boy. They always make Itailian people mobsters. So stick with other games like Simpsons skateboarding, JamesBond or Jak and daxter."
1,Rubbish,"This game is awful. Everything about it is second class. So what if you can steal cars and kill people. The game gets real boring after a few seconds. We shouldn't be letting our kids see this, especially post 9/11."
5,The best ps2 game ever,"GTA Vice City is the best game for ps2. It comes so far from the original GTA. Allthough GTA 3 is good you get a lot more privlages in this game. You can fly helicopters and planes. You can ride bikes. This game also realates to the awsome movie Scarface. Involving killing, blood, drugs, and language this game is not for children. So if you have PS2 and dont have this game I sugest you buy this game right now. Although it was way too easy to beat for me there are lots of other things to acomplish like hidden packages and rampages."
5,needs better graphics,"hey im still playing vice city and loving every minute of it. But when I played the third one it had why better graphics,but the overall gameplay got boring at times but vice city will keep you up all night. the third one is good but vice is better. ..."
2,a thirteen year old gamer,Grand Theft Auto Vice City is good don't get me wrong but its not as good as it could have been the missions are way way to easy I went through 19 missions without failing one and that was only in the first hour of renting it didnt need cheats or any thing this game would be great if you hadnt played Grand Theft auto 3 first but the in vice city the missions dont build on each other their jaust pointless it gets extremely boring to play this game if you dont believe me rent it but if want a great game get Grand Theft Auto 3.
3,"HelllooooOOO Harry...Mr. Sumner, Mr Brant..and Barry !",How you guys making out ? Did that 3rd party distributor get his share of Vice ? Seen Wedbush Morgan's Pechtner around ? Are the games selling at the polo club ? In the Hamptons ? Loved that CNBC interview... !!
3,ITS OK,This game is ok. It is fun 4 a while but it gets boring after a while. I really dont like it ne more b/c its boring. DONT BUY IT!
4,Good but not as good as GTA3,"This game is great until you play it for a couple weeks. Once you beat it, it gets kinda boring but you'll find something fun to do. It is not as good as GTA3 in terms of city layout, but still is still jaw-dropping. The music is great for people who lived in the 80's but I like the regular made up music in previous GTA's. I still like the various cars and extensive amount of missons. It all makes a very good, ownable, and fun game for people who like to commit crime in games."
5,The reason for owning a ps2,this game is the best game ive ever played if you have any sense youll get this game if you dont have this game you dont deserve to own a ps2 this game easily beats out competition. im not going into detail about everything in the game cause there are already alot of reviews with the features. just get the damn game
3,It's aight,"Decent game, pretty fun but the newer ones are definitely better, such as san andreas. But this one is an older game so it's a preference."
4,Grand Theft Auto Vice City,"GTA Vice City is a fun game to play in freestyle.I never got into the missions, I found them to be boring and tedious.I love to free roam in this game and just cause mayhem, that is this game's greatest attribute.The graphics aren't perfect, they are passable.The voice acting is good.Everyone who owns a PS2 should have a GTA in their collection and this is a pretty good one to have."
4,fun,Love playing it... played it a while ago ...always new missions and addictive...love the game would play it again and again
5,best ps2 game ever,"best ps2 game ever, slighly better than GTA SA because the controls are better and the view is more stable than San Andreas. Wish half the city was not locked though but that is what cheat device is for as I don't want to play the missions just freestyle around the city 'doin stuff' :)"
4,as good as san andreas,grand theft auto just keeps churning out better ones with its latest editions.
1,Game is not working.,When the game first arrived in June the introduction to the game played fine and when I finally took control of Verceti and drove across town to the safehouse the game froze during driving to the safehouse I played this game before at my cousins house and I liked the game but my copy of the game is messed up so I will rate this game 1 star for my game not working the way it's supposed to work but the game is fun and addicting.
3,THE GAME OF THE YEAR,THERE IS 2 WEEKS I GOT THIS GAME AN IS THE BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED WELL I AM NOT HERE TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LIKE IT I AM HERE TO TELL YOU HOW IS IT. WELL LESTS START: YOU CAN DRIVE BIKES LOWRIDER BIKES ABOUT 7 DIFFERENT KINDS OF HELICOPTER.THE CARS ARE VERY SIMILAR WITH REAL LIFE CARS THERE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE A CORVERTTE ANOTHER THAT LOOKS LIKE A HONDA CRX ONETHAT LOOKS LIKE A FERRARI AND MANY MORE. THE MISSIONS THE MISSIONS ARE VERY REALISTIC IN GTA 3 THEY ALWAYS KEEP TELLING YO WHAT TO DO AND YOU DONT TALK AND YOU DONT HAVE A NAME. AND IN VICE CITY YOUR NAME IS TOMMY VERCETTY AND YOU ALWAYS DISCUSS WITH PEOPLE WHAT TO DO IN THE MISSIONS. THE MISSIONS ARE LONGER THAN GTA 3 BUT THEY ARE FUN. THERE IS DODO TOY A ND BIG DODO AND DODO THAT GOES IN THE WATER. WELL I LOVE THIS GAME THATS MY GAME OF THE YEAR. AND I THINK YOU ARE GOING TOO LIKE IT TOO HAVE FUN
3,Grand Theft Auto 3 is better!,There is not alot of difference between the 2 games. Only difference is you get a helicopter or motorcycle! WOW!
2,vatican city,"Hello its me again the expert game player. I don't know why many people like this game. First it takes place in vaction city, I mean how boring is that. You are driving through churches, and schools. But it is kinda fun to steal the popemobile and run over popes and priests. The soundtrack is a little weird like you've got kumbiyah and john denver songs. Im gonna conquer vatical city now. Goodbye all."
1,More of the same,"How many ways can you kill and maim before you get bored? Well, for me in GTA3, it didn't take long. I am afraid that in Vice City, it took about three missions before giving up because it was just more of the same. If you became bored with GTA3, there is no point in playing Vice City. What is the interest in games aimed at mindless maiming?"
5,WOW!!!,"This is game is really really cool all is i have to say is WOW!.If u wanna know cheats and codes I'll give some.While playin game play press:R1,R1,O,R2,UP,DOWN,UP,DOWN,UP,DOWN.That one will get rid of your wanted level awayim gonna keep going.Weapon cheat #1 while playin game play press:R1,R2,L1,R2,LEFT,DOWN,RIGHT.UP,LEFT,DOWN,RIGHT,UP.Weapon cheat #2:R1,R2,L1,R2,LEFT,DOWN,RIGHT,UP,LEFT,DOWN,DOWN,LEFT.Weapon cheat #3:R1,R2,L1,R2,LEFT,DOWN,RIGHT,UP,LEFT,DOWN,DOWN,DOWN.And thats it if you wanna know more cheats just go to www.cheatplanet.com"
1,I absolutely hated this game!,"There was something about this game that really bugged me. It could have been the graphics which were too blurry and choppy, or the gameplay that just seemed wrong (too slow maybe)what it really was was the lack of random mayhem. There were too damn many cops to do anything. One second of fun mayhem would turn into ten minutes of avoiding the heat. Where is the fun in running? This game was a giant disappointment. Do yourself a favor and buy the soundtrack albums and listen to them while playing GTA3."
3,A sequel....,"It's fun, nice graphics, the motorcycles are awesome, a big production. Just like any blockbuster movie, the sequel is full of expensive FXs but the mojo is gone. Missions are not as challenging, weapons are thrown allover (easy satisfaction).You can go to the second island very early in the game (and is not that interesting). Finally, the city still is a zombie town: allot of potential but not quiet there.Just like in Hollywood, the Take Two guys rushed up to put tons of money in the production but not too much on the script, hopping to make another billion dollars (and they probably will).Still better than most games..."
2,GTA Review,"I bought this game really just to jump on the GTA bandwagon & see what all the fuss was about.Its way too hard for me.Unless your a ""rocket scientist"",I suggest you stay far away from this one."
3,Good Game,"GTA Vice City is a very well made game. The city itself is extremely detailed and the characters all have their own personalities.The graphics are okay, which is good if you don't want to see some guys head get blown off with a sniper rifle. This game is very violent, but other then that, everything seems okay.My brother got Vice City for Christmas, and ever since then thats all he does. I play enough, though, and this game seems to be very good."
3,Not as good as GTA3,"I was greatly anticipating this sequel. I had alot of fun the first few days, then I put it away and haven't played it more over 5 months. Never finished it. It was just not exciting enough. I wanted a better story. Although the motorcycles are cool, not much else is. See for yourself though."
5,GTA vice city ROCKS!!,"GTA vice city is an excellent game. it picks up where GTA3leaves off, adding many more ideas that make it an improvement over GTA3.Dont get me wrong, i relly loved it too but this game really ROCKS!!! from the old 80's rock tunes to all the new conversations of the people on the streets to the dirtbikes, helis, golfcarts,new and improved weapons of anarchy, i could go on and on. This game is a definite ""must have"""
2,vice city,the game is a near exact replica of grand theft auto III with the exception of the addition of motocycles and helicopters. the graphics are the same.. IF NOT WORSE than the original. there is only one city and there was very little done to make this game better. i dont understand why it gets the reviews it gets
2,It wears it rating like a badge of honor,this gam is on of the mos violent games i have ever played and is not reccomended for chilred under 16. But i was 13 when i played this game at a freinds house and liked it for a while the weapons are great and it was a great way to relive stress. By going on a mass killing spree. But this game i not as much fun as one would think. But it it deserves the rating it recivied.
3,hee hee hee,"I started the whole GTA thing with San Andreas, so anything compared to that is going to get a lower overall score. What can I say? GTA:SA is just the pinnacle of PS2 playing as far as I'm concerned.That said, I have to give this game all five stars for just a rockin' good time. We bought it a couple of months ago, and it was just a barrel of fun going through the missions. It's a bit easier than GTA:SA, but it's just hilarious and the 80s music rocks! The cars are cooler, too. And you have more opportunity to steal and drive motorcycles. My gf and I just play this (and the other) for hours, switching off based on who's better at different types of missions.Game's only $20 now, so you may as well get it. :)"
4,Vice City Rocks,"Don't take my word for it, check it out yourself. It's awesome especially the top notch voice talent provided by Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper and many others. The hundreds of liscenced songs are also really cool."
5,Good God!,"This game only starts to suck when you have to tear yourself away from it. You will want to take off school, work, showers, defecation, etc. Actually, it won't be that bad. It's an addicting, fun game. Don't look for anything educational or valuable, it's GRAND THEFT AUTO. It's meant to be FUN. And it IS. Twice as good as GTA3 in my opinion. The cops are tough as hell, too. Cheat codes are up, check them out at Gouranga.com."
4,Was worth the wait!!,"GTA Vice City is an incredible game. The guys are Rockstar have out done themselves on this one and this year's addition is an improvement over last year's game (believe it or not!). If you are a fan of GTA3, you'll definetely want to purchase this game.-peace"
5,Just like Scarface,"This game is just outstanding. It feels like you are actually Tony Montana (scarface). The mansion, the cars, your own gang and of course all the action pack missions. You play one mission and you are hooked into playing another one and so on. If you like the cursing and the killing this game is just for you. It might sound like it's too violent but like the label says for MATURE people. Well the cheat codes are good but you might just want try to do without them for a while until it gets really tough to avoid the cops. Hey I don't know anybody that has not liked this game and if you are one of those people just stick to Nintendo and play Mario Brothers. Enjoy the fun!!!"
5,fun for slmost sll sges,"OK JUST TO LET YOU KNOW MY KEYBOSRD IS MESSED UP SO THE i csnt write the letter next to the s on your keybosrd. but ill chenge the letter next to s to e's. so enywey vice city is e reelly good geme. es long es the people know thet this geme is not right in reel life, then its ok. usully ten end older know thet. it is ell meke believe. so this is e must buy."
4,Best game ever but with 1 flaw,I rented this game from blockbuster and went home to play it. After that is was all over i started playing it non-stop after that. This game is actually addicting to me so don't play it unless you have time. When i took it back i went and bought it right after that. First of all the graphics are amazing. The people look great. The plot of the game is awsome too it is in the 80's and it explains some things from grand theft auto 3 (like why phil's arm is blown off). Also in what other game can you go around just taking out your anger on people (perfect when you had a bad day). There is just 1 major flaw and that is when you are hiding behind a wall the cops can stick there guns right through and just start shooting you. All in all it is an amazing game and i would have given it 4 and a half but you can't do that.
5,Make More Like This One!,If you thought three was tight words can't describe this one cars motercycles helecopters the sky is the limit. The load times are a little longer but it's worth it for a game of this quality.The best thing though if you ask me is that just like all GTA titles there is no game over.The posibilities are endless.So do what you want to to in this fully roamable enviorement.
5,Best game ever made,Vice City is the best game ever made. I have beaten the game and done everything to do in the game. Even though I have beaten the game it is still awsome. You can get on a motorcycle and drive around for hours doing nothing. You can also get in the helicopter and fly over the beach and do scenic trips. This is the one game I will never tire of. I wish there were more than five stars availiable. If you haven't bought this yet you are missing out and I strongly recommend you buy it.
2,TOO MUCH VIOLENCE ON THIS!,"I think this game is too violent for kids man I mean I see and her many little kids play this I mean why are the parents letting their Kids play this? I mean I was watching the news 3 years ago when GTA Vice City came out and many Parents have been complaining that this game is too violent. and Besides I also think this game is a Rip off of Scarface because it almost has the same story as the Movie. So if you are buying a game for a young one or for an audlt to play, Please Don't Buy this!"
5,BREATHTAKING!!,DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE WHO SAYS THIS GAME IS BAD! This game is so good i would have paid 100 for it. BUY IT!
4,Coolness Defined,A cool game. Definitely a cool game. I can' think anymore playing this game its so cool.
4,fun... but after a while,"its fun like the first 3 or 4 weeks that you play it... then it gets repetitive and boring... I mean its a great game, I love the detail and the work that they put into it, I just get tired of poppin caps..."
4,It was fun for awhile.....now its kaput.,"It was fun when I got it for Christmas. It was fun for a week or two afterwards. Then I quit. Why? The gameplay was a bit too repetitive, and dull. I know I go against what others say about this game, but there ARE better games out there. Everyone says how great the graphics are, and they are good. But I figure the ones in Fatal Frame: A true Story are better. Fatal Frame was an intense game, well worth it. I made it about 23%-28% in this game and am fully bored with it. May I suggest kingdom Hearts or Fatal Frame? (EXCELLENT games.)"
4,GREAT FUN !!!!!!!!,"THIS GAME I VERY FUN TO PLAY.BUT IF YOU'R LOOKING FOR REALISM AND EXCELLENT GRAPHICS THEN DON'T GET THIS GAME.I MEAN THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT DESTRUCTABLE, THE A.I. IS POOR THE PHYSICS ARE O.K. THE CARS HAVE THE SAME WAY OF GEETING DEATROYED.I MEAN IF YOU KEEP SHOTTING THE CAR ANY WHERE EVENTUALLY ONLY THE FRONT OF THE CAR GETS ON FIRE.YOU CAN ONLY GO IN SELECTED BUILDINGS.AND I DON'T LIKE THE CONCEPT OF WE CAN ONLY BUY PROPERTY AT A SPECIFIC TIME.THE LOOK OF THE BUILDINGS IS VERY POORLY DONE.ANY WAY IF YOU'R ONLY LOOKING FOR FUN THIS GAME GETS A TWO THUMBS UP."
4,Solid fun,"This game runs on the same engine as GTA 3 so it looks pretty much the same. It plays exactly the same way, it's all the same except for the 80's setting. This is not necessarily a bad thing. If you couldn't get enough GTA 3 then this is basically it, more of the same game. If you're looking for a fresh game, this is not it. Although there are a few cool additions (motorcycles etc.) the actiuon and game play are nothing new. Overall it's still a good game, and it should keep fans of the previous one involved for a while."
4,Excellent!!,"Good graphics, sound and video. I did notice that the characters have no fingers!! It's fun to drive around and just cause mayhem and see how long it takes to get caught. I think some of the missicould have been lightened up just a bit, i.e. flying the helicopter to blow up the building and the task of taking out all the assasins at the mall."
5,Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Review,I bought this game two years ago. I reserved this game about three or four months before it came out because I knew it was going to be sold out the day it was out. I wouldn't recommend this game for children under seventeen years old. This game has a lot of violence. If you shoot someone's head off blood squirts out. It's kind of disgusting if you haven't play GTA III or other GTA's. Rockstar did very good on this game and I can't wait until Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas comes out in October. I'm reserving it...and you should too if you really want that game because it is going to be sold out no doubt!
5,GREATEST GTA EVER!!!,"I love this game.I still play it,to this day.The storyline is awesome and the characters are really cool.The whole 1980's feel,is just so great.If you're new to Grand Theft Auto,check this game out!"
5,Excellent Game with the BEST GAME SOUNDTRACK,"That's right, best game soundtrack EVER. From Ozzy Osbourne to those classic cheap 80's songs that you never thought you'd hear again! That's one big reason to buy this game. The next is the game itself. It is absolutely gorgeous, expanding on the ever-great Grand Theft Auto III. But now we can use helicopters, a plane that flies, and motorcycles. Some of the missions are hard (The Driver especially), but that's how it has to be. The voice casting is great too. Dennis Hopper, Jenna Jameson, and the man himself Ray Liotta as Tommy Vercetti. Buy it, get all 100 packages or beat the game and get the BEST SECRET IN A GAME EVER!!! (Too good to spoil ya on it)."
1,HORRIBLE,"Dont even THINK of letting a child get this game. Middle Schoolers and High Schoolers are buying this game, wich allows them to hurt innocent people (by shooting them, assaulting them, running them over with cars, etc, pick up prostitutes (then killing them to get back the money), and even engage in sex. This game shouldn't be on the market. Its a sickening image of todays society. Its sad that people find this a source of entertainment."
1,this is not a good game,This is by far the worst game I have ever played. Let me tell you that the beef in the market was so bad tasting that I had to eat the monkey that make the jello. And I am just getting started. This game also has a lot of cd's that can hurt a bo- bo and damage the skin. i really hate this game so you should keep it far from kids because of the mokeys.
2,Been there done that,"Owners of GTA III don't be fooled you have played this game before. If you don't own GTA III than you would love this game. Personally I actually think GTA III is more fun. Music is great but I don't buy games to listen to the radio. A few differences here and there but not breakthrough. Set in the 80's i would like to end with quoting PE ""Don't believe the hype"""
5,AWESOME,"Hey, I'm 13 and I think that this is an awesome game! It's very fun and EXTREMELY addicting. It can be very hard at some times, but it's still fun because you can just run around and do whatever you want. There are tons of cars, helicoptors, boats, and motorcycles to choose from. I know many parents don't aprove of it, but it's not extremely violent, and there is not that much cursing. Some people may say that video games inspire violence, but I disagreeVIDEO GAMES DO NOT AFFECT PEOPLEIF PACMAN AFFECT OUR PARENTS, THEN THEY WOULD BE RUNNING AROUND IN A DARK ROOM ALL DAY COLLECTING DOTS WHILE BEING CHASED BY LITTLE CREATURES AND LISTENING TO REPETATIVE MUSIC."
5,This is one of the best games i've ever played...,"Vice City is a great game.....The postive things:- The cars are great and fast.- The motorcycle is also a joy to ride.- Its fun knocking people off their motorcycles- You get to own mansions,factories,ice cream factories,etc.- The storyline is very good- You even get to own stripclubs and get lapdances from the girls- You could look good killing people by buying fly ass suits- The cops are even more challenging than on GTA3- Its just simply the best.- Cop it as soon as possible."
5,Great game,"To sum this game up you have to have played the game and have studied it some well that's me i rented the game at first it is a great game the thing is u can fly your cars if u use the dodo cheat you can steal golf carts and clubs.It has some wicked weapons like a huge sword u can get at a cafe shop at north point mall,or a meat cleaver u can get by going up to the gate to leave vice city and taking a left,or if u like to play dirty enter the all weapons code and u have flamethrowers baseball bat's pistols shotguns and some sniper rifles u have it made.Get a motorcycle and you'll be terrin up vice city doing wheelies on some of the best bikes around,but there is a horrible 1 that looks like a scooter no wheelies on that thing get the harley davidson or the sport bike,and the esiest one to do tricks on the dirt bike.The cops are way harder on this game then grand theft auto 3 they'll get u almost automaticly caught if u have only 2 felony stars.Get this game if u want some action."
4,Best Game in the world!!!,"Thats right all you dumb X-box and Game Cube owners, look what game we got now. The Grand Therft Auto series is the best! Unlike wussy games like Super Mario Sunshineyou can use a machine gun rather than a water gun.Oh and did I mention that no other system will ever get their hand on any of the new Grand Theft Auto games being Rockstar games signed a contract with Sony!P.S. For all you die hard Grand Theft Auto fans (like me)the Grand Theft Auto Vice City sound tracks will come out onOctober 29 the same day Grand Theft Auto Vice City comes out on the shelvesGame Cube and X-box sucks"
5,great game,"grand theft auto vice city is a great game.it still has some problems.some of the lots that you can own are not unlocked.but it is still fun.the missions are great because they are not to hard, but they do take some work.i also do not think they should take your money and weapons when you get wasted or busted. overall this game is great."
3,Grand Theft Auto Vice City,"This is a very violent game. I think there is way to much nudity, sex ,blood, and gore."
1,"good concept, very poor execution!","the controls are horrible (especially the first person targeting), ugly graphics, missions are stupidly difficult (could be ok if not for the frustrating controls), and some of them have insane time limit. this game probably never went through quality control. cross-stitching is more fun than this stupid game!"
1,This is really a disgusting game,"Not only is this not appropriate for kids, it's not appropriate for grown ups either. My husband loves computer games but finds this one disgusting as well. I'm not sure why raping women and shooting cops (among tons of other immoral acts) is considered entertaining. Who cares if it's not real! I wonder if anyone has stopped for one second to think about why they are enjoying these kinds of acts, even if they are ""just pretend"". It's really a shame that society has stooped so low that morals and values have gone out the window when it comes to how we ""need"" to be entertained.The graphics may be great but the content is nothing more that garbage."
1,this game is not that good,i personly hate this game it is just plain boring u do nothing and it is horrable!!:(
1,WOW,"I almost bought this game for my son, but read these reviews first. After realizing that none of the people reviewing this product could either spell or form a complete sentence, I decided to opt for something educational. Parents, keep this in mind!"
4,People these days,"I've seen so many people say ""his game is bad for our little babies"" and ""the contents are not suitable"" well any body who thinks violent games are bad for kids is wrong and they can try and shove every single violent game up their a**.The game Is a big inprovement from the last go for it you can't go wrong and dont be scared to use cheats"
2,Nasty,First of all don't get me wrong I think the missions on this game are some of the best ever. But this game is NASTY there is no call for all of the half naked women and that such.... Why can't people make a game for clean half intellegent people who are above half naked women on GAMES and such. Catch that ON GAMES! I would rank this game a perfect 5 stars if it cut back on some language and the girls in it had on some what clothing. It makes me want to vomit. What kind of perv came up with the idea of doing this. There are people who would like a game like this without the cursing and sexual content. I dont appreciate the way people look at teens now. .... Gamers do not support games such as Vice City. ....
4,Why all da tortore,"The Screenshots, details, cars, storyline, and previews, r tortore cuz we gotta wait, n I don't like waitin'. GTA3 was great, n dis should be betta(Hopefully). I hate reading instead of playin' cuz I wanna play it so badly. But waitin' is bad, but like they say, good come to all those who wait, but tortore is bad, but it's a good appitizer. I already pre-owend it at a store, and man I can't wait"
5,Too much to do in this town of Vice City!,At first I was a little disappointed in how the direction the game throws you at first! It sort of intimidates that this game is gonna be finished in a week and Vice City is not even as big as Liberty City. I was wrong about both and I remember now that this game does have twice more than grand theft auto 3 and that Vice City is huge with endless activities to complete a game percentage or just for kicks! Anyways I'm sure you heard of it and if you haven't played this yet than you are missing out in a pure classic of video games! Just wait till San Andreas : GTA 4 comes out!
5,......,"Well of course it has a lot of violence its rated ""M"" for mature :P So it is to violent for young ones but thats why its rated M to tell adults its violent and stuff. Overall i still think this game is awesome no matter how violent :P ..!!!"
4,Violent but yet FUN,This is my first GTA game ever. I am completely satisfied with the PRICE on here than at Gamestop
5,Absolutely Essential,"Grand Theft Auto Vice City is the best game I have played in along time. The missions are well thought out and are more connected to the story than in GTA 3. The graphics are much improved and capture the 80s feel exactly with the bright colours although the hands are truly horrible. The sound is arguably the best aspect of the game and included classic song from artists such as Michael Jackson and Mr Mister. The Dj's are funny but someimes don't quite seem to know what they are saying.I really see no reason why people are so predjudiced against this game and its predecesor about strippers and the foul violence. The violence is fun and, just like in real life the police chase you. The controls are simple and the game will last forever even if you have finished it.Overall, I would extremely reccomend Vice City for any gamer, serious or not."
4,"Vice City, Baby!","This game rocks. It's an open environment melee with good missions. Thank you, Sir. May I have another?!"
3,Impact of the Gaming World,"I liked this game for awhile when I got it. I thought it was pretty good and all... for like the first couple of hours!.. It was just a disappointment for me. I mean come on it is an almost exact copy of Grand Theft Auto 3. What was that about?! I mean yea we can fly helicopters in this one and it has alot more cheats to use (I don't use cheats on games) but still the cars are all almost the same, boats same, planes same, and so on. If I were you looking to buy a game I would rent this one before buying it. I bought it and now it is just sitting next to my Playstation 2 in a case. I got it on December 25, 2002 (Christmas)and I am aleady tired of it and have been for at least a week. So I say check it out before purchasing this one... save yourself some extra cash.A.J."
5,great mature game,"My 14 year old has this game, and as long as parents are aware of its content, it's a good game. I have to caution anyone who does not have any grand theft auto games...preview this! It's not for everyone under the age of 18, but if you know your children and can even play it with them, all the better."
4,why,why do some people write reviews on games that are not out at the time they write??????????????????????//
2,GTA3 is more fun,"Rockstar's decision of choosing Miami and the 80's is a poor one.Areas of Vice City look a lot less distinctive than Liberty City, In Liberty City, you can immediately tell whether you're in Red-light district, Chinatown, Business district, Up-scale area, or Industrial district. In Vice City, everywhere looks similar. And cars and outfits in the 80's just do not look very appealing.They should've chosen LA where there are Crenshaw district, Compton, Santa Monica, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, East LA, Chinatown, and Koreatown for the different feel of the city, and please, choose today instead of the 80's!They did not do a good job in the design of the missions either.I've completed about 20 missions and the missions have been kind of boring. In conclusion, GTA VC is just a huge disappointment for me."
5,INCREDIBLY FUN!!!,"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is the perfect game. This game boasts five islands: two big ones, and three smaller ones, as well as total freedom. Grab a car and cruse into the sunset, or grab a gun and rob a store. If neither of those satisfy you, why don't you hop in a helicopter and fly around listening to humorous talk-shows on the radio. The missions are also perfect: well thought out and fun! If you loved GTA3, then this is the perfect game for you. If you didn't play GTA3, then this is the perfect game for you. Vice City lets you do everything you want to and more, from flying planes to participating in demolition derbies. Vice City is a must have!"
5,SO AWSOME!!!!!!!!!,"Every one if you have PS2 you should BUY THIS GAME. You can ride motorcycles, caddys, shoot peoples tires out and more. BUY this it's off the HOOK!!!"
5,gta vice city,"It is finally here, the follow up of gta3 that has been anticipated by all.Although it is a follow up of gta3 they have many different features available such as makeshift weapons and brand spankin new cars and a whole lot of new missions.And since it takes place in 80's the style of the game is kickin.And the things that gta cant live without guns,guns,guns new guns such as swords and tear gas and even brass nuckles are on the streets of v/c.And thats why gta v/c is the best sequel in existince"
5,Tommy V rules Vice City,I loved this game !!!! I never played the other GTA series games until GTA3 was released which I love also. Rockstar games makes some awesome games. Don't let the [stuff] about violence or sex fool you. It's great clean fun.
5,Awsome,"I've played this game and let me tell you, This is the all-time best. It tops all others, with extended mobility, tanks, swat teams from the chopper, great missions, and the ultimate... high speed car chases! But you can't get enough from this game, from mugging, to assasinating, Vice City is the best PS2 game ever to come out."
5,Best!!!!!!!,"Many have said there is no nudity in this game, but there is one part where they are filming a porn movie and you a ladys [bosom](not nipples) for about 10-20 seconds. You have to get pretty far to see it."
5,give me six stars!,this is the best game of its kind its fun violent bloody and ruthless! it is the one game where you are the bad guy and crime always pays.
3,The BEST post-Ronnie album released by Skynyrd since '77,"As a Good Texan and True Blue Southern Boy,my feelings toward this CD is that it's phenomenal. This is undoubtably their best release as the re-vamped Skynyrd. The Last Rebel and Born To Run will send chills up your spine,I promise. The first track,Good Lovin's Hard To Find, is the perfect opener.Followed by the ode to self respect and being hungry for life and never giving up,the song,One Thing. Can't take That Away is a simple,gospel influenced tune that speaks to so much truth. Best Things In Life is southern rocker that tells it like it is. Tracks 6,7 and 8 are the weakest tunes,but that is really nit-picking,based on the fact that the previous songs are so good.The production on this album is VERY well done,brought to us by by Barry Beckett.I usually don't spend this much time on reviews,but this CD deserves it's just due.BUY THIS CD,if you are a Skynrd fan,or if you love the sounds of the SouthLands!"
1,Nothing Compared to 70s Skynyrd,"I am a big fan of Lynyrd Skynyrd, but this album just did not cut it for me. If you are a fan of the gritty, heartfelt southern rock of Simple Man, Tuesday's Gone, and Freebird, etc. this album is not for you, I know it wasn't for me."
2,Just Give It Up,"Sure, this album isnt as bad as vicious cycle, but still it's pretty bad. Johnny Van Zandt is not as good as his brother, who could write beautiful lyrics and a wide variety of songs. Today's Skynyrd makes some horrible country rock fusion gone bad that try's to play on some tough image. The old skynyrd created hard rock songs like Free Bird, country songs like Gimme Three Steps and Whats your Name, and alsoo sensitive songs like Tuesdays gone with the wind and Simple Man. I am a huge Skynyrd fan but this album just doesnt measure up to the standards set by the real band."
5,If you are a Southern Rock fan..buy this CD.,"As a long time Skynyrd fan, I was skeptical of their ability to put out new music which would measure up to their legacy. This CD has some awesome songs which you will love. If you love Skynyrd, but are getting tired of the old material, do yourself a favor and buy this CD. You wont regret it."
3,"Lynyrd Skynyrd - Two Great Tracks, The Rest Is Average","Rebel was the second studio album from the re-formed Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1993. Original guitarist Ed King was back in the fold as well as Gary Rossington, Leon Wilkinson, and Billy Powell from the classic version of the band. ""Rebel"" is a decent enough album, but they would go on to do better stuff once King was gone and Ricky Medlocke (Blackfoot) was brought into the band. Most of this album is pretty average southern rock. Not bad, but not great either. The lyrics are rather clichéd and the music is fine, but not particularly noteworthy. Two exceptions, and the highlights of the album, are the title track ""The Last Rebel"" and the closing track ""Born To Run"". Both of these are great songs and feature the best of what Skynyrd is all about, solid instrumental work and well thought out lyrics. The album is probably worth owning for these two tracks alone. All in all ""Rebel"" is an average Skynyrd release. Not bad, but they have done better."
4,Not if you're looking for extended mixes,"The single is undeniably great however this is not the CD single to buy if you're looking for any extended dance mixes. Both mixes on this CD are radio edits (and IF I had known, I wouldn't have ordered it.)"
3,Good story ...really funny editing,"This was an interesting story, little to do with HPL, but interesting none the less. The humor comes in as you read along and start playing continuity police. Misspellings, characters switching in mid conversation, a magic car that can't decide if its a Lincoln, a Dodge or a Plymouth, etc... Once I stopped being upset at the quality of the editing and got into the game, I started counting/writing down the mistakes from pg 116 on and hit 39 ""oopses"". This book is a prime example of ""proof reading by spellcheck"". So the question becomes Did Wildside Press fire all their proof readers before printing this book? If you get distracted by continuity errors, try another of Bischoffs books. If it doesnt bother you, this at least has interesting characters and a plot line with potential."
5,TOP-NOTCH FAST PACE SUSPENSE!,"Annie's novel ""Like a Knife"" is the wonderfully written suspense story of Rachel Goodman, who as a yound child witnessed the murder of her mother. Growing up she wants to help others and takes a job running a preschool with children witnessing violent crimes committed against their parents. There she meets Nick Raines who has a past. Together, they race against time to save a missing boy.Rachel falls for Nick but Nick does not want her to get involved because of his past.If you are looking for a fast-pace gripping suspense book full of surprises that you would not want to put down, look no further! This is THE book to get!"
2,Marylin remixed,"While there are one or two reasonably good remixes; most though are generally electronic drum beats behind some of the original backing. Some are just down right bad! The creativity level is fairly low! It's kind of worth it for the novelty value, certainly not to be taken seriously."
2,at best a curiosity,"Marilyn's original vocal tracks are almost always remixed way to the back of these tracks, with the club-beats pushed to the front. After a while, all you will hear are the drum-beats. The shame of it is that it would be interesting to hear her voice without the original instrumentation (all those 1950's violins and saxophones). But what we get here will bore you on the second listen."
3,excellent biology though flaws near the end,"This book is an excellent book for anyone intrested in biology to read, espicially after reading the selfish gene by dawkins.The chapters on game theory is an excellent introduction to the field. Another illuminating chapter is 'ecology as religion' which shatters the myth that primitive man was at one with nature .The main complaint i have is in the last chapter where the author thinks that by reducing goverment. This idea misses the message of Kroptkin who he quotes on the basis that goverment and capitalism are both hierchial in nature and use force.Capitalism is structured from the top to the bottom with distribution of wages and production controlled by the few instead of many. Also any state will at first defend the hierarchy of capitalism over self preservation.The idea of communal private property is an excellent idea to stop enviromental disasters, but it alone cannot solve everything."
3,"Yes, but let's not jump to conclusions.","I read this book soon after it came out in 1996, so my review is based on the general impression it left on me, rather than specific details. There is a lot of good thinking in this book and in general I would agree with the main ideas presented. However, what bothers me about Matt Ridley in general is his tendency to take biological facts and jump to sociological conclusions in one sentence, without a discussion on why one should follow him to this conclusion. In other words, this is not science but a presentation of strong personal opinions weakly supported by science."
5,A good book from a good author.,I am only a part-time amateur philosopher with a scientific/technical backgound but I still found it very refreshing to come across a book like this. Ethics / morality is something that nearly everyone feels strongly about but few consider objectively.
2,Not much use for this product,"It worked well in my garage, but once on the road, the signal is quickly taken over by a radio station. It only gives four options to chose from and if those stations have a good signal, you cannot use the Car Kit. I am considering removing my antenna to see if I can purposely lose the radio signal and still pick up the Car Kit signal. Maybe in remote areas (mountains) it would work okay."
2,it didn;t work for me,I bought it and it worked GREAT for about a month. The IPOD adapter went out and even though we changed the fuse like we had to do for the adapter it never worked again. But when it was working it worked great.
1,Easy Broken!! Poor Design,It's very complicated to connect in! It's keep broken everytime i tried to connect in my car. It's finally broken when it was on fired... The connector fell of and touched the cicrete thingy.. and somehow it was on fire..
1,CTA Car Kit for iPod,"PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM! First of all, there's no instructions that came along with the product, but only the flimsy cardboard. I fiddled with this item for almost an hour trying to get it to work. Finally, in the end, the sound quality is so bad that it wasn't even worth buying this product. It was in the way of my gears and lemme tell ya, it was hard to shift gears! Again, READ REVIEWS AND DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!"
4,clunky but worth it,"It was totally worth the sale I got it for... It's pretty clunky but if you don't mind it being aesthetically not pleasing, it's a good deal. It functions well (better than other car kits I've tried) and I don't have to keep an eye on it while driving."
1,"Looks great, functions horribly","Several problems with this product. The main being that the sound quality of the FM transmitter is horrible. It doesn'tbroadcast stereo sound all the time, and unless you plan on sitting in your car in one area where you get a good signal, prepare to have the sound quality vary greatly. I also found I got a better signal when I held the transmitter in my hand or wrapped foil around it, which looks horribly.Bottom line, do not buy this expecting to have your ipod play through your car speakers just like your radio. In fact, there are very few FM transmitters that will give you flawless sound. If you want good ""consistent"" quality, you are going to have to use a casette deck transmitter which provides a direct line into your ipod. But out of the many FM transmitters I've tried, this is the worst."
2,"Functions as a decent holder, charger.","This product works fine as a holder and charger for my iPod (4G) in my 98 Jetta. However, as an FM transmitter, the sound quality ranges anywhere from fair to poor. I still use my cassette adapter for sound input."
1,Fried My Car's Circuits!,"I was using this iPod adapter for a few days when suddenly my car started to behave extremely strangely -- the clock stopped working, the central locking system failed, the door alarm went off all the time (even when the door was closed), and the RADIO STOPPED PLAYING ALTOGETHER!When I took it to an electrical auto specialist, he checked my fuses and found that the 3-in-1 had actually FRIED my fuse. He swapped the fuse out, told me never to use that piece of junk again, and everything worked properly. This no-name product is total garbage and for that matter dangerous. Use at your own risk if you are foolish enough to buy."
1,Yuck!,The box reads CTA but no where on the items does it show a name brand. I could live with this IF it did not produce a strong shissing sound when used. I tried all the pre set channels. They all did the same thing :-( I tried different types of musice to see if it just one track. But I got the same very loud shissing sound no matter what I played. I have returned it and had my iPod hard wired into my sterio system. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I repeat do NOT buy it.
1,Wow is this thing worthless!!!!,"I've never written a product review on Amazon before, but I feel so strongly about this item, I had to. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! It whines, it hums, it's very cheaply made, it only has 4 radio presets, etc, etc. Between using this or not listening to my iPod in the car, I'd rather listen to silence. It's much more relaxing."
3,Fm Trans,well when i got this product i didnt excpect to much the transmition from ipod to my stereo in my car id rate a 3 for some reason or another it fits loosely in the cigarette lighter and if i hit a bump or a i go around a corner to fast it will become disconnected and switch back to what was on the radio as for how it is when its actually working it does a good job for only investing 40 dollars it does what i want it to but as i said it would be nice if it had a snug fit when in the cig lighter
3,great...and then not so great...,"this worked perfectly in my old car (an '03 hyundai accent) however when i totalled it and had to purchase a new car (an '06), not only is the cigarette lighter in a bad position, the sound quality is terrible. it sounds as if its playing underwater. also, i had to tip the whole unit sideways so that my ipod wouldnt fall out because the lip on the bottom to hold it in is not wide enough at all (i have a video, 30). this is the best one i have found so far and it works especially great for offroading in remote locations but now i am currently saving the money to just have it hardwired into my CD player. i feel that it is a great temporary solution, especially for the price that i purchased it for."
1,cta digital car kit for ipod,am glad u asked this item does not work and it does not hold the i pod in place
2,Good product (BUT),"When I saw the product in my coworker's car, I like it. When I ordered the product and started using it ( @ first it will goodbut after one week it is not working the way it was working @ first). the signal was bad, you cant use it wireless again. I dont know what happen, i guess it my luck . But dont get me wrong it is a amazing product."
1,"after 1 song the ""3 in 1 Car Kit"" stops transmitting.","The iPod fits in and connects o.k., but after 1 song the ""3 in 1 Car Kit"" stops transmitting. The iPod is still running but I have to remove the ""3 in 1 Car Kit"" from the cigarette lighter, plug it in and again it only plays one song.I tried setting the songs to cross fade so that there would be no gap in between songs; still only plays one song.As soon as the connector is unplugged I can move to the next song, but with the connector plugged into the port only one song will play and as it is playing the iPod screen freezes while playing (The song plays, but there is no movement on the iPod screen).My iPod works fine when connected to my Macintosh computer via the connector port."
2,Could've spent more,"I purchased this as a Xmas gift for my sister and she waited a long time to tell me it didn't work. Poor quality, not useful at all."
2,Only four channels to choose from. Get the digital one.,This product has become obsolete. I wish I read the reviews before purchasing it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It only has 4 stations to choose from and in my area all the stations are being used so I cannot use the CTA. I am going to purchase a digital one so I have more options on stations.
1,do not buy,"i bought this for my brother in law, since my sister bought him an ipod for christmas.so he plugs it in and all is well, for a few minutes.suddenly the radio goes static, and this thing starts TO SMOKE.completely useless, and within the first few minutes of use.luckily his 1-day-old ipod was not harmed by this malfunctioning product."
1,Does not work,When you try to attach it to the car does not fit properly and in any curve or speed change the ipod goes to the floor of the car.
1,This item is horrible,"I have to admit, the price of this item got me. It's now 40 bucks down the drain as it has failed to work completely. It worked for about 8 months but was very fuzzy. The quaility was that of an AM radio station. Recently, it quit working altogether so now I am back in the market for one that will work."
1,CTA Digital 3 in 1 Car Kit for iPod,"Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before I purchased this unit...I was caught up in my new Christmas present...so I bought the car charger/transmitter. With only 4 FM setting choices to select from, I was unable to get the unit to play through my truck radio's FM stations. But, I did find out how great Amazon's return policy is and I returned the unit postage free the day after I got it. I'm still looking for a charger/transmitter. I bought a Belkin today but, the static is loud in the background and it does not charge the Ipod...only runs the Belkin transmitter. It drops the FM signal which, in turn, blows out your ears with the static that a non-transmitting station does when your radio is on it."
1,item didn't work,Unfortunately the item didn't work. The company offered to replace it but I just decided to pay more and buy locally.
3,It's okay,"The sound is a little fuzzy even on the strongest station, the volume doesn't play very loud and my ipod nano slips around sometimes - it doesn't hold tight enough. What I do like about it is that it is small and doesn't get in the way."
3,Radio I POD,The product does connect to the car stereo. It works as advertised. The weak link of this product is the holder. It doesn't do a very good job of holding the IPOD in place. In my Subaru Outback the holder competes with the shifter for space. I have to remove the IPOD anytime I want to shift the car into park (so flexibility is not its strong suit. On the plus side it is less expensive than other similar items. It does extend your car audio facilities so you can listen to hours of uninterruped music at decent fidelity.
1,Don't buy this,I tried this in my car and it was the worst signal I've ever heard. I couldn't hear a thing.
1,do not buy this product,I did not listen to the all reviews instead I bought this product. Now I have to throw away this garbage. It's a waste of money.
4,Not bad at all for the price!!!,"The three in one kit works very well and is easily transferrable between vehicles. The convenience of playing music from the Ipod in the car, while charging the battery, is a blessing. Doing so without the hassel of wires and cords is an added benefit. I recommend this product."
2,"No feeling, though great sound & music","The previous reviewer who compared this version and the old Callas version to new and old Ferrari's was exactly correct. The old Ferrari, though it has not as good TECHNICAL qualities due to the advances in technology, it has real feeling and charisma, just like Callas's Tosca. This new version has really awesome sound and music, but the singing was weak, and lacked the fantastic feeling that Callas provided. Besides, the recording quality of the Callas version isn't really that bad, though side-by-side, the Callas version sounds compressed.I strongly prefer Callas because to me, Opera is about feeling and drama, not how clear the recording is... getting a stellar recording is just the icing, not the cake."
2,one not working on arrival,"like the title says. it shipped, but one of the darn tweeters just didn't work. however shipped quickly and not a bad price, will see about a replacement"
4,Them mudbone tickers,"them there skweeders make up some ticking rukkus, I sound like one of them little dipsticks going down the road tikkkin, sounds like i have all 4 tires with little air leaks and when rolling -- makes that tikkin sound. pst pstt pss pstt pstt psst pst ppst tst tst tssst pst tsp psst pipst pipsst pippsst."
5,Didn't work for me.,I tried to use one as a GPS speaker but the sound was no good for that. They seemed to be well made and would work fine if used as intended.
4,Great olive oil,The Meyer lemon adds a great clean flavor that is not over powering. Very refreshing.
5,Meyer lemon oil,"I purchased the blood orange, lime and lemon oils. The lemon is delicious as are the other two. They are a great addition to your cooking tools."
4,Laguna PowerFlow External Filter 1000,"I have had this for a few months now. I must say, it does work with a little help with beneficial bacteria. I have this running on the Laguna 600 pump, it's feeding into the external filter. The bacteria can grow on its own, or you can buy products to start the biological process. I would not use this with anything larger than 1000 gallons. It is a bit smaller, with a little added bio-media added such as ceramic rings, a few lava rocks, plastic scrub pads, and a few small air conditioner filter pads (not included) this things works great to grow bacteria. Only mods I would suggest, adding a air pump with air stones in the media, so the bacteria will grow. I have done this by drilling a hole and adding a air pump to media. Also the parts made are a little cheaply made but do the job."
3,"JMMontgomery, my introduction to new country","Without being drawn to country music by JMMontgomery, I probably never would have found Kenny Chesney and Alan Jackson. Thanks JMM!"
5,One of the Best Violinist: Renaud Capucon,"I was driving home yesterday at 7PM with KUSC on the radio and heard the absolutely digitally clear, beautifully phrased with perfect pitched & tempo orchestra version ever of ""Introduction and Rondo capriccioso in A minor Op. 28"" by Camille Saint-Saens. I just purchased this on MP3 and will also buy his other CDs: Beethoven & Mozarts."
2,Just ok,"2white mesh filters do not catch enough fine matter, ie algae. Purchased a different filter material for more fine filtration. Second filter slot does not do much for filtration, so i havE loaded bio material in there instead. The filter is ok, but I was expecting a better result. Definitely needs to be cleaned EVERY DAY!"
5,Genius!,"Another brilliant compilation and a must have for any Nick Cave fan. Nina Simone's ""Plain Gold Ring"" is worth the price on its own."
5,best knives on earth.... can be used to operate,"This things are sharp.... the metal is so high grade that when the blade goes dull, a small effort is needed with a honning steel to make it sharp as new....The blade is thin enough to make precision cuts and strong enough to cut cartilages and bonelike partsthey last a lifetime... grest materials and designhandle is nonslip and the knife is well balanced....f3"
3,"Lighthearted, Fun with Sexy Stars","This movie should be on DVD. It was Farrah Fawcett's second big screen outing after leaving Charlies Angels and probably the best of the three feature films she made in rapid succession. This one is a light hearted tongue in cheek thriller that has some genuine moments of comedy and allows for about 90 minutes of escapist entertainment. Alongside a gorgeous Farrah (dropping broad hints that she may be an actress as well as just a sex symbol) theres, Art Carney, Charles Grodin and a very funny and sexy Joan Collins pre Dynasty."
5,Swisscard,I love it. There are a dozen different types. I got this one for myself. I got the one without the flashlight for my wife and grand kids. They are great.
5,Victorinox Swiss Card Lite,"We love this compact pocket carry combo. It is so light you may forget it is in your pocket, or pocketboook.Being Swiss made the steel is unbelievable.It is used daily.Get One at: http://www.amazon.com"
4,"Helpful, despite weak, dull knife","I purchased the Swisscard at the same time as the similar ""card-knife"" tool from Tool Logic and have carried and used both. The Swisscard is superior in terms of its multi-functions, and the various individual tools on the Victorinox are stronger and sturdier than the similar functions on the Tool Logic card tool. The multi-head screwdriver tool on the Victorinox, while tiny, is surprisingly effective. (I'm talking about small, around-the-home-or-office-type of repair jobs, not workbench stuff.)The major disappointment with the Victorinox card tool is in the knife blade. It's weak and dull. It's more of a letter-opener. I had to work extensively with a whetstone to achieve something close to a practical edge. Also, as mentioned in another review, it's not full-tang. The Tool Logic Credit Card Companion, while the inferior tool overall, features a better-designed, stronger knife blade."
3,"Wallet sized, but not for the wallet","I had one of these a relatively short while ago. I bought it up in Boston, and it seemed like a good investment. It is cheap, and has a lot of useful things on it. I kept it in my wallet because it seemed like a convenient place for it. It worked perfectly for the first two months or so, but then I started having issues. Behind the edge with the ruler, there is a seam. Because I had my wallet in my back pocket (like most people), the seam started to break, and the plastic cracked. This worsened over a month or so, and then the tweezers and the toothpick got stuck inside, and the only way to get them out was to crack it open. I closed it up with Krazy glue and some duct tape, and went on with my life.The little knife is pretty crappy, but comes sharp. It shouldn't be used for much more than opening letters and cutting light plastic.It is a great thought in general, but I recently switched over to the Tool Logic equivalent, and I much prefer it."
3,"It may turn out to be useful, but....","I bought this wrench because I need a 15 mm wrench for those times when I might very well have to repair/replace a flat inner tube or replace the outer tire, itself, because it's just worn too badly.I expect I'll be able to use this wrench on the front wheel of the bike, since there is nothing in the way of my using this item, but there is just too much metal and cables at the rear wheel, and I will have to buy a ratchet wrench for THAT part of the bike.Someone usually helps me fix the bike when there is ""trouble"" with it, but the time is rapidly approaching when I'll have to be able to do the job ""myself""."
5,A life of joy and tragedy,Right on the eve of Beatlemania in the States came the chart topper from The Singing Nun and its album which sounded like a stripped down version of Songs Of The Auverne.The fascinating story of the Singing Nun (Sister Soureee) became an MGM musical starring Debbie Reynolds.An English language version of Dominique was made by the Lennon Sisters and their was even a trad jazz rendering by the Village Stompers
5,A beautiful collection,"I first heard her sing in the 60's on the radio. My father brought home a 45rpm record of it. We had few records, yet hers was a favorite. When I saw it on CD I had to buy it, even though I still have the 45... 45 years later."
5,Heavenly!!!!,"I used to have the vinyl long playing version of this recording, it was one of my favorites when I was small. I have been looking for this record for many years. It has the most beautiful songs and fills your heart with joy. Thank God that someone had the good sense to publish this in the new CD format."
4,The Sining Nun,It is as good as I remembered! I gave the album to my Mom as a gift when I was 6 and we listened to it for hours. Now I can do the same with my children.
4,"Dominique, nique, nique.........","My boy's name is Dominic, and my uncle told me about the song ""Dominique"", so I bought this album. It's a nun playing a guitar and singing catchy tunes in French. It's either your thing or it isn't - you be the judge."
4,The Singing Nun,"I would like to know if the English version is available. I loved this record as a child and I now have the video for my kids, but would love for them to be able to listen to the English version of the songs."
3,Its still fun,"After reading all of the other reviews, I had to chime in. I have read both the LOTR and these books. Clearly, these books use the now classic ""Tolkien"" recipe for fantasy. But when all was said and done, these books were still fun reading. Are these books as complex as LOTR? No! But they were fun reading. Certainly, any person that reads Fantasy must read Tolkien. And once you read Tolkien you will find that NO other books compare... but that does not mean all other books suck.At the end, I say if you are a ""Tolkien Snob"" and have read LOTR dozens of times, then don't read this.. it will only make you angry. On the other hand, if you read for fun and enjoy fantasy, I would say give it a whirl... you will most likely enjoy it."
1,Pure Dribble,"McKiernan's Iron Tower Trilogy was completely stolen and plagiarized from Tolkien, but the books are still a decent read albeit at a very childish level and worth three stars, barely.McKiernan writes at a very amateurish, childish level. All his characters are completely scripted. The bad guys always lose, the hero's can all jump tall buildings in a single bound and they always win and get that girls in the most ethical way possible, LOL.McKiernan is also horrible at foreshadowing or having any twists whatsoever in his books. Everything is completely scripted and you can predict the outcome of every battle or situation before it even happens.While the Iron Tower Trilogy was decent at a very childish level The Silver Call Duology is just pure garbage, pure dribble, and worthless from the first page to the last.I judge books on how quickly I want to read them again and how good they were the second time through, but these books aren't even worth reading completely the first time through."
3,tolkein,"if you read the forward toone of the series, i cant remember which one though, he says straight out that these are deeply derivitave of middle earth, and he fully admits that. from what i recall he referred to it as an homage to the stories that affected him so."
1,Tolkien clone,"This book would be very engaging and enjoyable to anyone who has not read the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, but in that case I would just encourage you to read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings! This book is an INCREDIBLY blatant mimic of Tolkien's classics, from place and character names to the plot (dwarves enlisting the help of halflings to reclaim an ancestral foretress); even phrasing and narrative techniques are strikingly similar. In places lines are very nearly verbatum, and I am utterly amazed that he was even able to get this printed. Tolkien himself would have been rejected if he tried to publish it, because it's not just similar in style and tone, it's so nearly identical in parts that printing it would be (and is) redundant. I can't believe this guy hasn't been sued!!!"
4,Good and Easy to Read,"I'm attempting to write a hard boiled mystery and I've read almost everything I can get my hands on on crime and writing.This is a great book cuz it has short, informative chapters and also suggestions on where to get more information.My only complaint/gripe is that he doesn't explain the jargon in a few places. I felt I could have used a few more examples in order to truly understand what he was getting at. Jesus used parables -- and look where it got him!"
4,Good information,"This is a good reference book. However, there are other more current reference books on the market that are better and more up to date. The Administrative Assistant's and Secretary's Handbook or The Office Professional's Handbook has more detailed information."
5,Awesome info for the Administrative Professional,It trulys reflects the role of today's AP. I take great pride in keeping well informed and my skills sharp. The material in this book enhances my professional image. If you're serious about your career get this book.
5,Great Book!,Very helpful book with lots of good information for any Office Professional. Touches on many different categories within an Admin's job description.
2,Poor replacement,"I bought this for my Homelite trimmer. This string is much thicker than the original. The originall had a separate groove or gutter for each string. This only has one. The two strings are stuck together when spooled and are supposed to separate as it unwinds (Like some licorice does). I don't like this design. One of these two things seems to make the motor work harder than it did before and the motor is stalling more frequently. It's having problems unwinding, probably because of one of the two issues above.Also, the thicker string means that it appears to be much shorter than the original, meaning I'll have to replace it sooner.When I have to replace it again, I'll look for something else."
3,TITLE IS MISLEADING,I was disappointed in this book. It is really a big book on how to modify commercial patterns. It does NOT show you how to take measurements and make your own patterns or slopers.
3,Basic pattern altering,"I have not made an item from this book but I have skimmed thru it. It does not teach ""original drafting"" but how to alter commercial patterns. So i guess it is ok."
5,an excellent book,"Target Hiroshima by Albert B. Christman is great book that you would enjoy reading. It tells the story of William S. ""Deak"" Parsons, the man that played a great part in researching, assembling, and finally, dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. If you read this book you will learn about the life and hardships of Parsons as you also receive information on the development of the atom bomb and proximity fuse. An interesting and educational book that I recommend you read."
3,"Great album, but my booklet is missing songs","I've been a King Missile fan since the early 90's(Sensitive Artist & Detachable Penis are my personal favorites). I took advantage of a sale recently to buy this cd that I hadn't heard in a while.Their lyrics are so amusing that I looked forward to reading along while listening. However, upon purchase of this cd I was dismayed to find that my booklet-insert was missing some pages & had some dupblicates (Im missing songs 3-6) but have duplicate pages for (#s 6-8 & 16 & 17).I assume this was not deliberate but is just an accident due to shoddy assemblage."
5,MTV Banned?,"I just can't believe why this video was banned from MTV! Wrapping your car around a post and hitting a few people is hardly violent in today's standards. I've seen much worse in the videos that MTV doesn't ban! Besides the video, there isn't anything else on the DVD. But that's ok, because you're only getting this or the video, right? The video is actually pretty comical. The old lady just kinda is there for the fun. Madonna goes around and has some innocent fun... Well, innocent besides hitting a few people and destorying some cars. her husband did a good job directing it.This is a fun little DVD video to pick up. Must-have for Madonna fans, good fun for the rest of us who aren't! Enjoy!"
3,true to maddy form...,"She's the ultimate marketer for this single by having it banned. It's good although I believe she should've cast a different variety for the men. Let's have the Hunky set play bad guys! Say George Cloony, Brad Pitt, Jon Bon Jovi (I'd love to see him get shot!) or better yet handsome hubby Guy Ritchie play the men being avenged upon. The Cosmo girl sect would never approve, but most women could understand these feminist views much better!I give it two stars because no DVD is worth wasting all that space, but one more star because i love the remix."
3,Other better videos....,"I am a big Madonna fan but this is not one of her best videos. I think ""Music"" and ""Don't Tell Me"" are much better videos. ""Don't Tell Me"" reminded me of what a great video artist Madonna is. As a Madonna fan, you may want this as part of your collection. I'd prefer to see it as a part of a video collection. However, I don't think all the fuss about the violence was justified. I've seen MUCH worse on MTV."
4,What It Feels Like To Be Banned,"Well, part of the Madonna legacy is her ability to combine her music with stellar and breathtaking videos. No exception to this latest controversy...The reason why this video is banned is not fathomable. We have seen much more violence and sex on MTV, so cut the crap. The video is like a little Guy Ritchie crime craper. Who says a car thief can't be a woman? Who says a woman can't squirt water onto policemen's face? Madonna says you can...and if you look beyond the so-called violence in the video, you'll find the subtle message of the very superior original. The heart-thumping club remix that this DVD is cut to just serves to hype up the action.It is a splendid work of visual, just one complain: there's only one video track here. Why not add another remix video or even have a version cut to the original song...I always thought the origianl version would turn out a great video too...."
1,30 Bucks For A Video????,"OK, I've seen it and the mixes. Whoopee. Video of rude vulgar chick taking old woman from home and running off a cliff. There, you've seen it. I cannot believe this is so expensive for ONE SONG! The older she gets the less anyone respects her, for making millions in such a cheap ripoff way. Oh, and the DVD froze up once."
2,what the hell,"What the hell was she trying to do in the music video. I know she wanted it banned so there will be more of a demand leading to profits but the video is stupid. Even in back in 2001, she had daughther Lourdes and in the video she's doing ultra violent stuff and being all suicidal and gangsta. Give me a break. What a f***kin poser. I have all Madonna songs and remixes but i'm really getting tired of fake wanna be posers like her."
1,MADONNA DOES IT AGAIN - BUT THIS IS REALLY POOR TASTE,"""What It Feels Like For A Girl"" is a beautiful song about women in a male dominated society and their day to day struggles may it be career, education, intelligence, etc.However Madonna went on a rampage with violence and guns - and with the way society is today Madonna should of made something more positive instead she blackballs us with this junk.Trying to get a little press to sell a few more singles. Shame on you Madonna!....You are now a mother and I can't believe that you would stoop to this horrible homage to violence instead of taking this great song of yours and making a beautiful video.A definite miss, however the dance single remixes are excellent.I may be contradicting here, but the music is great, however the video ruined my image of what a great song this was."
1,A question for all the women reviewers here,"Women's liberation,huh? How many of the women who feel that way about this video would like to see their husbands, fathers, sons or brothers get hit (intentionally) by a speeding car driven by a woman all for the sake of her 'liberation'? You're all no better than Mathers"
3,"Not M's worst, not her best","I really was confused watching the video, mainly because the original version should have been used instead of the Above & Beyond 12"" Club Mix (although, the song on its own is amazing) because the lyrics and imagery would fit. Otherwise, superb directing by Guy Ritchie.Oh, and to all the mega-conservatives: big deal. This video is not saying ""women should drive into a pole"", but just stating the issue of female suppression. Obviously, if the original of the song would have been used it would've made more sense."
5,One of the 10 top albums of all time,"What can I say....I love this record. It's the best album by the Kings of Metal and and an absolute must if you love heavy metal. The only part I didn't like were the couple crappy parts in the middle of 'Achilles...', but everything else was just awesome. I'd give this one 6 stars if it were possible!"
5,One of the best Heavy Metal albums ever,"Manowar....well what can I say. They are one of the best. I've been listening to them since 1991 and when Triumph of Steel came out I just ate it up. With those killer guitar riffs and monster drumming, they just take you long with them, to their world. You have no choice but to go along. The only other groups that I think come close are Candlemass and Obituary. They all make you want to go out and kill all those poser metal bands. They make me sick. HEAVY METAL OR NO METAL AT ALL."
3,Images of Strong..,"Women And WarRior womEn line this albUm..When I Give a Listen I'll decIde the Fate of The Manowar..RevIse ""KingS Of MetaL"" Review..Keep up the strenGth.."
1,One Star or Five?,"I guess it depends on your perspective. The first track is hysterical and probably worth your time, but the humor seems to wain shortly after. It's simply one of the worst albums I've ever heard in my entire life. It's so ridiculous it's awesome. The band tries to mask their inadequate songwriting with frequent flashy solos that have absolutely no meat to them. Technically they aren't even impressive. I can't tell you how many times the guitarists repeat the same riffs in their solos. What they are good at is double picking vamps.There are strong similarities between certain passages in this album and Celine Dion. I'm not kidding. How can these guys have the balls to get the ""more metal than thou"" platform? Let's not even get into the lyrics. They make Helloween and Blind Guardian look like gifted lyricists.I'd save money for that fantasy sword that you're saving up for."
2,Smaller than advertised,"This item measures 10"" wide x 10"" long. I guess if you measure it diagonally it would be 12"" x 12"". Who measures a pillow diagonally? Very small. Good quality."
1,"Not original, not well done","I looked at her website and she seemed like a dynamic energetic speaker with a lot of good ideas. Turns out this tape series is obviously read by her from a text with no energy or even awareness of what she is reading. It is dull and poorly done. Worse, a lot of what she says is a rip-off of James Dobson, even down to reading all and I mean all of the lyrics of ""Cat's in the Cradle"" and the implications of that on fatherhood. Dobson has been doing that since the early 80s. I found there to be maybe one or two helpful thoughts in the entire series. Overall not worth buying for any price."
1,Don't Buy!!,"I bought one of these thinking ""it's just an adapter, why spend double the amount for the Xbox brand?"" It didn't take long to find out. The picture was fuzzy and there was a intermittant buzzing with the audio. If this is indicative of all Pelican products, stay far away! I bought the Xbox brand and it worked like a dream..."
1,Do Not Buy.,"I've spent hours upon hours playing my GameCube with this as my memory card. Yesterday, a message pops up saying ""The Memory Card in Slot A is corrupted so it must be formatted, OK?"" Okay? No. Not okay. Hours of data lost. It's not dependable. I take very good care of my products and the memory card has not been exposed to any kind of weathering, spills, or carelessness."
5,Lodge enamel dutch oven,Exactly the size and shape I wanted. The dutch oven is very sturdy and well enameled. I got the cafe color and the color is nice and vibrant. I especially like the white enameled interior of the pot and lid - that makes it easier to see what you are cooking. It was well packaged and arrived in perfect condition and exactly on time.
2,Chips easily,"I love this pot for its even cooking and its appearance. But, the glazing chips very easily. I've hot it only a few months, and taken good care by not using sharp utensils and storing it without stacking anything on it or placing other pots next to it. But, it already has 3 minor chips on the exterior. These don't impact cooking but they are unsightly."
1,Hated this,I quickly returned this when I found it frustrating to put the toy together. The little bar with the characters does not fit into the holes. I tried for at least a half hour to put it together and found it to be a waste of time. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone.
1,Also couldn't get the bar into the holes,"I received this as a gift and have never been able to use it in the car. Not once was I able to get the bar into the holes. Too bad, because this toy has promise. When I hold it in front of my daughter she smiles at the faces."
2,it's just OK...,"I was looking for something to hook to the seat for my baby. This is a great idea but could use vast improvement. The toy bar is too heavy to stay in the holes and hangs too low for the baby to see. Once I was able to finagle the toy bar (there is a strap with velcro that I assume is supposed to support the toy bar to keep it in place), it works OK. Eventually the toy bar fell off and it is buried in the depths of abandoned toys in my car. We replaced it with a mirror that has Elmo attached to it - much more fun for baby and me!"
1,Not as easy as it looks,"Got this as a gift but returned it soon after we found out how difficult it is to put the toy bar into the holes to attach it to the base of the toy.My husband, who is extremely handy, and I both became frustrated trying to put the bar in the so called holes. They were not exactly a perfect fit. Plus on the box it does not tell you that the toy only attaches to certain types of seats in the car. If anyone successfully put the bar on with ease, let us know. We returned it for something more user friendly. We would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Not correct color,I bought this after my yellow lab passed and was very very disappointed in the color. It has more of a reddish orange color than a yellow lab color. It looks like a lion cub if you ask me. I had to return.
2,Did not come with the child pictured,"The toy was cute and fairly durable, but it does NOT come as pictured. The child pictured was not shipped with the dog, making it false advertising. Overall, a fine footrest and an OK toy."
1,A REAL BUMMER,"This tape is not worth the time or the money to watch it, it tells you absolutely nothing and is worthless with what it does tell. Beside that the sound is bad but reguardless of that the information is too general and vague. Just totally NOT worth your time!!"
5,AWESOME,got this for an xmas present for my wife and she loved it! .. she couldn't believe that she could fit it in her wallet!!
1,lite not worth it,"Don't buy this if you want it for the light. It's range is about 1 inch from the card. Even then, it is so weak you can hardly see what it's pointing at. And this was in a perfectly dark room. If there is any other ambient light, it provides no useful enhancement. You're better off feeling your way around with your hands.Although I agree with other reviewers that the pen is too small to be comfortable using, the rest of the tools are fine. Just don't buy this one if you think the light will come in handy sometime; it won't."
5,helpful swisscard,"Victorinox Swisscard Lite, Sapphire is a swisscard with helpful tools and the great thing is that you can carry with you all teh time because it's size is the smaller than a wallet."
5,practical and innovative!,I gave it as a present to my 16 year old brother. He loved it and since then he is constantly fixing things and playing with it.
4,Swiss Army in your billfold,"I've been a fan of Swiss Army knives for many years, but lately I have not been carrying one around in my pocket. I saw this one at a business I was visiting and said I need one of those. That night I found them on Amazon and ordered one. It fits perfectly in your billfold, it is credit card size. Do not try to take it through a metal detector because it will set it off. It is a well made product, as are all Swiss Army products."
4,EXCELLENT (almost),"This CD has excellent live music, and almost all of the songs on the album are redone very well (especially ""That's All"", which, despite an earlier reviewer's opinion, is a nice live version of a slightly stale studio song). However, there are two songs that i absolutely HATE: ""Tonight..."" and ""Invisible Touch"". These songs, in my opinoin, have been butchered (especially ""Tonight..."", which runs into ""Invisible Touch"" where the instrumental should've started). Collins just starts yelling for no reason after I.T. should've ended. Hence, four stars. The rest of the album is excellent."
3,Best of eigties genesis - do we need it?,"in a few words - performances are very good,songs too of course.but do we need that kind of best of if you can buy ""Turn it on again"" compilation that contains all the songs in no-crowd-sound studio versions? ask yourself and answer.songs are worth 5 stars but all album is nothing special and studio versions are much much better"
4,sequel to Three Sides Live,"This is a sequel to Genesis' THREE SIDES LIVE album(that being one side of the 2 LP set with studio tracks). The band promoted WE CAN'T DANCE when they recorded this album. Here are live versions of songs from GENESIS,INVISIBLE TOUCH and WE CAN'T DANCE. There is a shorter version on TONIGHT,TONIGHT,TONIGHT from INVISIBLE TOUCH. In GENESIS' MAMA,where drummer-lead vocalist Phil COllins sang ""Mama,please don't go!"",he sang ""Motherf---er,don't go!"" on this version. That wasn't necessary,but he did. A second sequel,VOLUME 2,THE LONGS was released three months after this one."
3,"A collection of hits, that I am a bit tired of...","This cd contains the ""hits"" from the band, under Phil Collins era, I have to say that I'm a bit tired of hearing these songs, but also, most of these live versions are ""refreshing"" to hear in a different version.I prefer these versions to the original ones. The sound is pretty good for a live release. That's All folks !"
1,"Not for everyone , ONLY for those who like the POP years.","If you enjoy A-HA and Duran Duran this is for you , now if you are one of the prog. fans , then forget it ."
1,A sad state of affairs,"Though Genesis has released some duds in their time this one is clearly scraping the bottom of the barrel. The song selection is awful and even the better songs are mangled. This may be live, but it's quite lacking in life. Don't waste your money."
1,Bad live cd,"Every song on this cd is a joke. Genesis used to be a good band, look into Genesis Live, Seconds Out, or Genesis Archives Vol. 1 for better live material."
1,A travesty,The Shorts is by far the worst Genesis album as it concentrates only on the hits. Theres little to reccomend here. The band play without showing any kind of depth or real talent here.
4,The Roaring 20's!,"Paul Whiteman is no Jelly Roll Morton but his orchestra was huge in the 1920's, playing every night at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. Amazingly, Whiteman's music has held up beautifully through the years and the musicianship displayed here is excellent. Whiteman is best known today as the man who gave Bing Crosby (then with the Rhythm Boys) his first big break, but the songs on this album don't feature Bing, just joyous Whiteman orchestral music. This is a time warp if there ever was one. For those of us born forty years after Whiteman was a hit, this gives us a taste of the Roaring 20's."
4,Very Nice,My father who rememberes Paul Whiteman said it was a very good recording and it brought back lots of memories for him. We were very pleased.
3,Odd Choices,"The best brief introduction to one of the 1920s' most popular bandleaders, but especially for a one-disc set this is an odd sampling. Most of the early 20s hits are included, as well as Bing Crosby's early vocal on ""Ol Man River,"" but why use the electric rather than the acoustic recording of ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" especially since the latter is available on so many other collections? All in all, a two-disc Whiteman would certainly have been better. Barring that, a more eclectic Whiteman would have given the listener a better flavor for the range of his work."
1,terrible!!,this item does nothing other than make the ride of my truck very rough and nothing else!! don't waste your money on these!!
4,great book on the social construction of sex,"O: The Intimate History of the Orgasmthis is a great book, relatively easy to read and absolutely asks the questions that got me thinking, and talking about how we as a culture define sex. The author's view is alittle biased against our Western culture but not so much that it ruins the book. You won't see sex the same after this one."
3,Hard to assemble,"Our Chinese Hamster likes the cage, but I dread cleaning this cage as it took so long to assemble. If you are not mechanically inclined, do not purchase...it's instructions were not helpful. (The directions were given only in pictures and we ended up having to assemble in a different order than pictorially represented for it to work.) As for the size and etc. it fine. The wheel is quiet which is nice and can be removed for the hamster to explore the house. At the $20 I paid it was an okay purchase, but I'd never pay more than that...just simply not worth it!"
5,Kids love Super Why!,"They especially like this collection, since it has the puppy in it. We love all the PBS shows. Educational and Entertaining!"
5,Great for Super Why lovers. Over 2 hours!,"Purchased for my 3 year old who got a gift card to Amazon for Christmas and he actually picked out this DVD since he loves Super Why. I'm really pleased with this DVD as it's over 2 hours long, whereas so many tv episode dvd's are much shorter and it's disappointing to the kids. Very happy with this purchase and quite a value! I don't mind him watching this show either, he's learning his sounds and I don't feel like it's garbage tv. Thanks, PBS!"
2,product not as described,"The product was not as described. It contained the doctor and martha. It only worked correctly once and then cuts out halfway when people are speaking. I talked with the company and they said they didnt even have any of the doctor and rose in stock, but if you notice the picture has the ninth doctor and rose.. and the description says it is the 10th doctor and rose. I told them all I wanted was the product I ordered and they said that it didnt even exist... when obviously, due to the picture it does."
4,THE DR WHO BANK IS BANGIN,I bought this bank for my newborn grandson and it is every thing i expected with the light that lights up.
4,"Beautiful, soothing music","I bought the mp3 download of this album to play as background music on my WiiEndless Ocean: Dive, Discover, Dreamgame. I'm going to transfer it to an SD card which plays on the Wii. There is actually a song with the title ""Endless Ocean"" on the CD. How cool is that? This is new age music, so if you're a fan you might like this. A couple of my favorites are ""Moonlight Chaser"" and ""Beyond Horizons End"" All of the music is so relaxing and soothing. The whole thing plays just barely under an hour, a good deal for a single album.I think it would also be great music to fall asleep to at night or maybe to listen to on an ipod while on a plane, for meditating or any time you just want to drift off."
1,For those who would choose to commit suicide by means of coma,"Jacob L. Mey is surely one of the great thinkers of our time. With literature, I tend to hold to the adage: if I can't figure out what's going on, it must be literature. This man must be a giant. At every corner he seeks to surprise you with a bauble from his font of wisdom, further obfuscating whatever you had a meagre hope of reading. Although the bulk of this book can be condensed on a single sheet --and indeed, I think a revised addition should include it as an appendix-- the text is so difficult to comprehend, so hard to grasp, Sherlock Holmes himself would be at a loss. Trees have died over this! I would like to illusrtate my point with copious examples, but the thought of opening that book of my own volition shakes me to the very core. So, I leave you with the advice, flee from this book as you would a horde of bees. I, for one, am going to burn it in a ritualistic fashion once the rain lets up."
5,TRACK LISTING / Review:,1. When We Pray 3:292. Uncommon Love 4:223. Ready to Fly 4:464. Lay it All on Him 4:175. Open Arms 4:126. Hallelu Yahweh 4:347. I Open My Heart 3:498. Breath of God 4:379. All That I Need 4:2610. Come to Me 4:15Great upbeat contemporary christian pop. You can hear the late 1980s sentiment here with the clanky bass and keyoards.
5,Excellent book for wives of policemen,"I gave this book to my son-in-law for his birthday in 2001. He is a policeman locally and love the book so much. He had his wife to read the book because he says that every woman married to a policeman needs to read this book so they will understand what they go thru. Personally, I have the same condition that Richard Smith has which is Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. I think its great that Richard wrote this book because living with pain all the time isn't that easy, but Richard shows us that we can do anything even though we have a disability."
2,"Durable camera, use as toy","This camera is very durable and seems to be easy to use for a 3 year old. My daughter has fun taking photos with it. However, do not plan on using this camera to print pictures. The image quality is absolutely terrible. The display on the camera is even worse. I was hoping to have my daughter take pictures with it and maybe get one or two pictures that we could print and show as her first attempts. However, we have made this just a simple toy instead of a usable camera for pictures. Expensive toy camera. I would have paid a little more for one that had any quality of picture that matches the technological age :)Bottom line - if you want a toy that acts like a camera and that is durable, then this should suit your needs, if you want a camera you can use to print photos, by a new state of the art camera for your family and give your older one to your 3 year old."
4,Great camera for the pre-school crowd,"We got this camera for our 3 year old daughter, she loves it. It is very durable, and easy for her to use. She can easily review the pictures she takes and delete any pictures that she doesn't like. You will want to buy an optional memory card to store more pictures. The photo quality is poor, but that doesn't matter to her. If you are buying a camera for a more responsible carefull, grade school child, you will want to buy a regular cheap digital camera. But for the younger kids who love taking pictures, who can't be trusted to not destroy a normal camera, this is the way to go. I would give this 5 stars if the photos were not so blurry. This is the only digital camera with an lcd display on the back for the younger kids that I have found. I highly recommend this product, just don't expect the pictures to win any awards."
1,disappointing,I bought two of these cameras for my kids and what a disappointment. They really enjoy playing with the cameras however the quality is terrible. You can not see anything on the LCD screen so I do not know why they put it on the camera. The quality is better when you download but still in the poor category. Very disappointing. I expected more from fisher price.
4,Perfect for those under 10,My [...]daughter loves her camera and the pictures don't turn out too bad. The camera is very sensitive to light conditions and pictures can be overexposed. It keeps her hands off my expensive digital camera and is very sturdy!
3,"Good concept, poor quality","The concept of a digital camera for children is great. Pleased with the durability of the camera. However, the LCD screen is small and difficult to view the playback of the photos taken. The camera also makes an annoying beep when the buttons are pushed."
1,It's a horrible camera for its price.,"It takes horrible pictures. Pictures are blurry, color-tinted. Worst of all, that viewfinder that Fisher Price advertised as kid friendly is its worst feature! What you see through the viewfinder is not what goes onto the memory. We got one for my 5 yr old daughter and I kept telling her that she should not cut people's heads off from the picture. After a few lectures on how she should see all of her subject in the viewfinder to no avail, I decided to try the camera - and guess what? I cut her head off, too. Only 75 % of what you see in the viewfinder goes through the actual lens of the camera. I, as an adult, can learn to compensate but try teaching kids how to compose pictures with such a handicap. It was a big disappointment."
4,Five year olds LOVE it!,"I read a lot of negative things about this camera in these reviews, but I went with my initial plans and bought each of my twins one for their fifth birthday. They are constantly asking me if they can take a picture with my digital camera, so I thought it would be good for them to have their own. They LOVE these cameras! They used them for the first time yesterday and spent the entire day taking pictures of my flower garden, the cat, each other...pretty much anything they could find. The kids couldn't care less that the image on the digital screen is not the clearest. THEY know what they took a photo of. And they had just as much fun deleting the old photos as taking new ones. The cameras are so easy for them to use. We went over what each button does, and they took it from there. They were already experimenting with taking photos of the same subject from different angles and distances to see how it affected the results. I highly recommend these cameras!"
3,Heads Cut Off,"Before the camera quit working on us, I realized that the viewing for the camera requires you to compensate for the fact that the lens is a good inch lower, and most pictures of people are of their heads cut off. The digital screen on it is very hard to see. I would steer clear of this camera unless your child is old enough to compensate for the difference in eye piece and lens placement.They are on the right track with this product, but it needs improvements to the viewfinder and lens placement, and the delete button right in the back.We are pretty sure it quit working because it was dropped a few times.So, durability not sufficient for the high price.My 2-3 year old LOVED it and we are sad that it quit working."
1,Very disapointed,"Horrible, horrible pictures. I can't believe Fisher Price would put out such junk! At least make it good enogh so the pictures can be printed! Auto flash is a joke. Flash should be on all the time, but it still wouldn't help the quality. Disposible film cameras are 1000% better than this waste of money."
1,cell phones make much better pics,Tis quality is just unaccaptable. On writter said it was about cell phone quality.. No ... my cell phone pics I can download and look at. My granddaughter is great at taking phone pics and this is not workable. I am buying a different camera.
5,Kids digital camera,"I bought this for my grandson (age 4). He likes it, but he did have a hard time figuring out how to use it at first. Once he got the hang of it, though, he took lots and lots of pictures of the ground, our feet, the backs of seats in the car, etc. But he loved taking pictures because everyone else was taking pictures with their cameras! It has taken many falls and still keeps on going!Issues - 1) He loves the noise it makes when it deletes the pictures a little too much, though, because he then wants to continue deleting pictures just because of the noise. You should be able to turn this noise off. 2) It is bulky and heavy for a child to carry around. 3) The pictures it takes are horrible. You can barely tell what it is a picture of - there has got to be a way to improve the picture quality. 4) It uses a lot of batteries.Overall it doesn't matter about the little things, because my 4-year-old grandson is happy with the camera and the pictures!"
1,"terrible pics, still she likes it","I was one of the ""lucky"" ones that found one camera on the shelf at WalMart for $54. It was pink and never opened so I was thrilled. Then we opened it up and started taking pictures. The image quality is horrible!!! Low dpi resolution, awful flash, images are blurry and colors are washed out. The only thing in the back lcd screen that looks good is the FP logo and when you look into the viewfinder to snap a pic it is not what gets recorded (head room is cut off). The only plus is that my 4-year-old daughter loves to take pictures with it. We run out of space quickly so I'm always downloading to my Mac (works fine).Now, having seen this camera in action I would never have bought it for her. VERY disappointed and I'm going to tell FP about it. I would invest my $50 in a cheap or reconditioned real digital camera."
4,Good Toddler Camera,"I purchased this camera with the understanding that the picture quality wouldn't be great but wanted a sturdy camera for my 2 year old to enjoy. He is so excited to have his own camera and it lessens his interest in my much more expensive one! Prior to this we would let him snap his heart out with disposable cameras, but then you are paying to develop 20 shots of his thumb! The quality indeed isn't great, but it has already withstood several hard knocks and is still working. It is also designed to be simple for kids to master quickly which is great. My only complaint is the fuzzy quality when viewing the pictures on the camera screen, but my little guy is just happy to see the pictures he has taken and doesn't seem to mind the poor quality at all. While it is a little expensive, this is a great item for a budding photographer. Just be realistic with your picture quality expectations and catch any important moments with your own camera."
4,"Rugged Camera, Mediocre Pictures","My son has only had the camera for 2 weeks now, but I have a good impression of this camera. Its solidly constructed and easy to hadle for children. The on camera buttons are simple and well placed for little fingers. The resolution on this camera is very low and the pictures are worse than most cell phone cameras so if you are buying this for your child to print out anything, I'd take a pass. Also, the software that comes with the camera requires adult interaction. The built in windows wizard is almost easier. All and all, its a great toy for children who like to explore the world around them and have an interest in photography!"
3,fun but not durable,"My son totally loves this camera because of the ease of use and he is able to take pictures and ""see"" them. 5 days after he received it from santa it broke. He dropped it and the soft part by the eye piece split and broke. He was devestated because I took it back to where I purchased it and there are no more left. They are definitely not worth the $90 listed here. The photo quality is poor and durability is a joke. When I saw on the commerical that the boy dropped it down a flight of stairs I thought it would be perfect for my 5 year old...but after only 5 days we are without a gift from Santa. I gave it a 3 because of the ease of use and my son loved how fun it was. I will probably just buy a different digital camera to replace with at least 3 megapixels....this camera just doesn't live up to Fisher Price quality."
1,Takes Horrible Pictures,"Believe me when I say that this camera takes horrible pictures. It may be okay for a toy for play, but don't expect it to take decent pictures inside or outdoors. The flash is useless beyond about 4 feet. Within four feet, the flash washes out the image. Even in bright outdoor sunlight, the images are grainy and blured."
5,worth the money,I bought this camera for my 3 year old for his birthday because he loved to take pictures and he broke my digital camera 2 days before christmas. I got this camera knowing that it was the first of its kind (meaning that it was going to be pricey) and that is was made for a toddler. After reading reviews I was a little concerned about the quality of the image...but really he is three and doesn't care about the image quality...he just likes push the button and take his own pictures. The bottom line is that it was worth the money...my camera is safe from him and he LOVES to take picutres.
3,it's just an OK camera,"It's a cute camera. The design is great for little hands and it seems to be quite durable. My 3 year old son runs around snapping pictures - usually of feet. I say it's just ok because the picture quality is terrible. The flash seems to ""wash out"" the subject of the picture - and when you look through the double view finder to snap the picture - that's not what you get. I found that you need to look at the LCD display to see what you are actually photographing. The delete button is a little too conveniently located right next to the view finder. But it's fun for him and he really likes going back and watching slide shows of the pictures he took. I wouldn't recommend this - unless you are just getting it for fun because the picture quality is terrible - I'm disappointed in the flash. It's on all the time and it's too bright."
1,Good Concept...Bad Product,"The first camera I purchased for Christmas never had a flash. It took awhile to get a new camera because they were so popular over the holidays. The second camera worked off and on for three months before it stopped working entirely.I'm very frustrated at all the time I spent trying to replace this product TWICE. I haven't tried to replace the product again because I am sure the end result will be the same. While it worked, my 4 1/2 year old loved the camera. It was easy to hold, he loved taking pictures and ""seeing"" what he had taken. He felt very big with his own digital camera. The LCD quality is very poor but he didn't care. The problem is that the product itself is so cheaply made and of poor quality that it doesn't matter how much my child liked it. The fact is that two of them have not worked. You can like something all you want but if it never works...then what does it matter?"
2,Stopped Working After 3 Months,"My son enjoyed this camera while it lasted, but after 3 months the camera ""froze"". The screen was on and none of the buttons worked anymore. The only way to turn it off was to remove the batteries.I expected more because of the amount of money I spent!"
4,It's ok.,"I purchased it one month ago. Up to now, my kid just used it for one time. Yeah,the picture is not so clear, however, at such cost and as a toy,what can we expect it?"
3,"mix of essays- some interesting, some sleep inducing",A set of essays by different authors discussing Americans' relationship to Israel. Most of the essays (but not all) focus on the last half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th.The essays vary widely in quality. Some are fairly interesting snapshots of American attitudes (I especially liked the essay discussing the evolution of Mormon attitudes towards Israel from strongly pro-Zionist to conversion-oriented). Other essays were sleep-inducing laundry lists of American good deeds.
2,Beat Yourself Blind !,"If sugar coated vocals with slightly heavy guitar playing is your thing then this should be a must for you.Personally I was a bit disappointed;Radar Love,Broken Heart,When the Children Cry(good acoustic guitar),Cry for Freedom(very radio friendly),Lady of the Valley(Live! ),Farewell To You(One of the many ballads),are a few of the no.'s that save this album.White Lion is a great band to start with especially if you're graduating from Bryan Adams and looking for something your mama would approve of.Not everybody in leathers and long hair rocks!"
3,Good enough...,"This cd is ok. It could've added some more songs (""Goin' Home Tonight"", ""Living On The Edge"", ""Till Death Do Us Part"", and ""Warsong"" to name a few), but it's a good sample of White Lion's best known songs. All the hits are here. Vito Bratta's guitar and Mike Tramp's vocals are good together, sorta like Van Halen mixed with Dokken. More songs and something from their hard to find first album Fight To Survive would've gotten this cd more stars."
4,A band that couldn't make it,"White Lion has always been different from most 80's bands. If you have to get any of their albums, get this and possibly their debut album ""Pride."" With awesome songs like ""Wait,"" ""When The Children Cry,"" ""Broken Heart,"" ""Love Don't Come Easy,"" and ""Hungry,"" this greatest hits compilation holds up well (although I would've preferred the album version of ""All You Need Is Rock N Roll""). Worth getting if you like 80's rock, but if you are a hardcore rocker, you will probably not like this."
2,A load of C*ap,"White Lion were just a rip off of Van Halen, except VH were better. I can't believe some of these reviews, I have listened to this album intensely, the guitar player was copying Eddie VH not only on his tapping, but wangy bar and riff building. The songs make you wanna heave, ""Little Fighter"", ""when the Children Cry"" and ""Love don't come easy"", this was just a sad attempt at trying to cash in with the glam rock chart material of the time, but they failed. If this is the best of, then I'd hate to imagaine what the worst of sounds like, cause it must be diabolical."
3,They cover the bases,"I'm not much into ""best of"" CDs, but with some bands it is the best way to listen to them. White Lion never has been a strong album group. The singles are for the most part what made them. So if your wanting the ""Big Hits"" and the rest of the tracks worth anything, pick it up."
4,"Not incredibly written, but profoundly important","As a twenty year old heterosexual male I found this book to very insightful. Monette illuminates both the sturglles and the shame of the homosexual community. I understood that it was hard to be gay, but this book has really helped to show me that this strife comes not from any inherent feeling attached to homosexuality but is a result instead of the prejudice and hate of the public, many of whom are supposed closet cases. I think that eventually America's continuing and blatant homophobia will be seen in the same light that we now view the cross burning and racial pogroms that dominated our contry for centuries. I wish you all strength and courage in your battle against these evil forces. Thank you."
5,"Recommended by a friend, a very good biography.","I identified with so much of this book. Paul Monette went through so many of the same emotions that I went through coming out, only many years apart. An amazing read and a picture into what it was like in the 60's through the eighties as a gay man."
2,passionate but poisoned,"I read this book years ago and recently came across it in an old box and reread a chapter in the middle. It is rather brilliantly written--the author is a great raconteur, and has style and wit; reading it is like spending a few hours with a cantankerous and opinionated old guy who never lets anyone else get a word in edgewise. But finally the prejudice and self-righteousness become overbearing."
4,A story for gays and straights,"I think one of the reasons I liked this book as much as I did was because I see so much of my own life in it; and a lot of those feelings I had long since forgotten. The struggle and turmoil he dealt with are chronicled ably. His style is to jump back and forth between past events and current feelings, like the omniscient narrator in a movie would; it is an effective way to comment upon occurrences and enlighten the reader. He also has a take-no-prisoners style of writing (notably on what gay life is like) that may be a little disconcerting to some readers. And on occasion I was impatient with all those pre-gay details and wanted to know what happened after he came out, but the book is really the story of what happened to him before he came out. Overall, a poignant and satisfying read."
5,connections to my past,"I remeber when I was 8 or 9, my grandmother kept correspondance with Lola Harvey to assist her in writing this book about my ancestors. It was such a huge event in our house when the book was published and our signed copy was delivered. On the cover was a photo of my great-grandmother and the shall she is wearing is now mine. When I was old enough to finally read this book, I was captivated by the detail and affection Harvey used. It opened my eyes to an era I will never see and because of it I can understand and relate to my grandmother's stories of her childhood even better"
4,Samsung li-ion battery slb 0837,"This Battery is Great is last long time more than just regular AA batteries. buy it, is a good idea have a spear in vacations or long trips sometimes you don't need to have the charger with you. the cost of this battery is not bad, compare it with sony batteries or even the fake sony batteries , samsung is a leader in electronics and so far no problems with this company. i have a digital camera, mp3, car stereo and li-ion batteries. they are made to last"
5,Wonderful book,Animation with character studio 3 is the greatest. The exercises really help to develop a clear understanding of character studio as a whole. The thing I liked the best was the attention to detail on adjusting envelopes in order to properly get your mesh to deform. I would recommend this book to anyone that would like to do character animation.
1,Not worth the money!,"This book is not worth the money! I got better education just reading some online tutorials (try loonygames.com, look for tutorials by Paul Steed), or the manual!.. This is an awful book and the files on the CD sometimes crash.I dont know why there are so many other reviewers rating it excellent!?"
2,"Different string sound, not agreeable to all tastes.","I downloaded this recording from a source other than Amazon, so I have to qualify my comments; the cd may sound different. I find the string sound of this recordingunpleasant. I enjoy some of the ""period practice"" recordings such as Mozart or Haydn, but for me Brahms needs a large 'modern' orchestra. There are tons of excellent recordings of this symphony from the 1950's through 2011 (say, Simone Young for a recent one). This recording I don't need."
4,"Nice product, a little pricey","I love this stuff. The color is wonderful for me, and does a geat job of moisturizing my lips. I wish there was a little more ""plumping action"", but it does give a nice, light tingle. One serious drawback is price. For me, sixteen dollars is quite a lot to spend on one lip gloss."
1,Did nothing for me,I was hoping due to some of the reviews that this product would have been more effective. It didn't do a thing. I only used it twice and haven't used it again. I have used many plumpers and this one just isn't effective :-(
5,High Recommendation,I would highly recommend this book. The book has a very sound theology and has excellent scholarship at a layperson's level. It will help any reader gain a more insightful understanding of the purpose and leading of the Spirit in connection to the Church (people of God). Dr. Fee is able to properly exegete the Scripture of Paul's writings and help our understanding. This book is good for all Christians and especially those wondering (or concerned) about the role or move of the Holy Spirit.
5,Great book.,This book is very interesting. It greatly helped me understand the Holy Spirit in my life and in the church.
2,Horrible DVD transfer!!,"I have seen this movie on European television and it was magnificent. The first 70 percent of the movie is a bit slow but given time, it eventually builds up towards the breath-taking combat scenes towards the end. The final 30% makes up for the first 70% tenfold!! The cinematography, the music (a disco rip-off of Clint Eastwood's Hang'Em'High)are just as great. Casanova Wong is quite a graceful and agile fighter in this one.I was VERY UPSET upon viewing this movie in DVD format in the states. It was like they used something worse than EP mode because the frame rate was EXTREMELY choppy. But if you are a die hard kung fu flick fan, I still have to recommend getting this for the movie's final moments. Yes, it is that good. Another thing interesting to note is that the opening credits are in Italian, just as I saw it in Italy all those years ago. Strange; wonder if it was only released there?"
2,A cheesy Cassanova Wong kickfest,"Evil Mongolians have taken over the Shaolin Temple and superkicker Cassanova Wong must stop them. He learns a special technique of kung fu that gives him great strength when the sun is shining on him. Eagle Han Ying stars as one of 3 evil monks who take over the temple, and I was really disappointed that he didn't get to show off his skills. Most of the fights are not very good, but the last 20 minutes is nonstop sped up Cassanova craziness. He does plenty of kicking and faces a couple of good villains including Austin Wai Tin Chi using double swords. Overall the movie is pretty bad, but the last 20 minutes are worth watching.2/5The Videoasia DVD has bad picture quality, but its widescreen which is nice."
1,Painful to watch!,"I got this, expecting a horror movie, instead, I got a really badly done softcore porn film hiding behind some badly written wanna be horror stories. There are about 4 short stories, all with intros by Terence Stamp (who recently starred in the film, The Limey). The stories are poorly done, and seem like they're just excuses to show badly shot softcore sex scenes. If you're looking for a horror video with lots of short stories, check out the fiendishly fun Creepshow (1982). Heck, if you're looking for Softcore sex with a horror theme, try Vampire Call Girls or even the T&A flick Nudist Colony of the Dead! Anything but this! I hated it!"
5,The real stuff,"There is a small, authentic Mexican taqueria not far from our house where everything is homemade, including the hot sauces. My wife bought this bottled sauce one day and it tastes almost exactly like the one at the taqueria. Not quite as hot as the homemade stuff, but the flavor is right on the money. Much less vinegar and more chile flavor than others. Best bottled stuff I have tried."
3,good info and stories--could do without the rhetoric,"Several great first person stories about some of the new Jazz greats--esp. Coltrane. Personally I am sympathetic with the politics of the book, but the language seems very stilted and dated at times. Great critique of the white dominated music business and critical intillectual snobbery."
2,Too strong for me,"I was surprised to see how highly rated Burberry is on Amazon. Received it as a gift and of course tried it on right away. I was displeased with the fragrance -- found it too heavy for my taste. Waited about 20 minutes and re-checked - it did not lighten very much and I still did not like it. In my opinion, it was too spicy, strong, and heavy.That being said, I don't wear it often; but surprisingly I get compliments nearly every time I wear it. I've come to believe it's just so strong people can't help but notice it... it's either that or my perennial allergies have distorted my sense of smell."
3,I don't think so.,"Best way to describe it-somewhat sweet but sharp at the same time. Very potent. I sprayed a little on my wrist and my dog could smell it few feet away. Unfortunately, I didn't care for it-I think its a bit too strong for my taste."
5,"Mmmm, dreamy nights.","I first got a whiff of this from a magazine enclosure. It got me curious, as they rarely do. Passing Sephora, I went in for a test...and felt seduced by the classy charm of the scent. It seemed to have a rich sophistication which goes with horseback riding or polo. After a few days, I still couldn't get the scent out of my head so I went back to grab it up. I've only had this experience with a few other fragrences...but they were of a totally different style...Angel by Thierry Mugler and Flower by Kenzo."
4,Very very nice,"I was really surprised by this one. I'd seen all the hoopla surrounding Burberry's other fragrance, Brit, and yet I found it too heavy. This one, however, is wonderful. It's not too much of anything. It's got a wonderful clean, modern scent that is very easy to wear year round and I've gotten lots of compliments. This is a good everyday scent that will allow you to smell wonderful without intruding upon others."
5,"Rocks me to my ""core""!",I love this CD! I had it (lost it) when it 1st came out. So glad to have it back in my collection again...thanks for sending it to me quickly! :)
5,This here is great music for the time period that it was created,"This band was and still is quintessential to this early 90's time period of ""grunge"" categorized music. Great all together!"
4,correct craft replacement,nice that i could still find some original equipment for my 1989 correct craft ski nautique. awesome!
4,very nice purchase,"these are so cute, comfortable, and nice fit- they seem to be best suited towards skinny pants because they only get snug at the mid calf- a great buy for the $$, the colors are more vibrant in real life than the photo leads you to believe."
2,Beautiful boots... that run VERY small,"I was really looking forward to these boots... they've since gone to charity, after two wearings. They run EXTREMELY small... I wear a size 7 ... I bought these in a size 7 1/2 to allow room for socks and they didn't fit, even with stockings. They were a great deal and so not worth the shipping to return them. They are as pretty as the picture, but highly disappointing in the fit. They were very narrow and the heel was hard to walk on (might have been the fit). Since I buy everything from Amazon, these seemed like a good bet, however I might not buy shoes by mail anymore based on the disappointing outcome of this purchase."
1,don't bother!!,this particular boot I wanted a comfortable one but instead is stiff on top and I get too tired when walking..
2,Not as good a fit as I'd like,"Look great, the foot fits wonderfully, but a bit too snug around the calf. When pulling the shaft to its full height, almost cant zip and I don't have large legs! HOwever, I can wear them if I scrunch them down a bit... would have returned them but didnt want to pay the shipping fee for that."
5,comfort and fit,I purchasd this boot without trying it on. it is one of the most comfortable boots I have ever purchased. Great look with jeans and dresses
4,Essential Dutch Grammar,"I'm just a beginner in Dutch. And this book is very useful for such students. The essential grammar is explained very clear that is very important, especially for students for whom English is not native (my case). But of course to use this book without additional course or books is not enough. So it's a good reference where you have to look at sometimes. And I recommend to buy some other course for more complete study of Dutch."
3,A Good Overview Text,"Definitely a good book to give you an overview of the essentials of Dutch grammar. If you need something a little meatier, though, I highly recommend ""Dutch: A Comprehensive Grammar"" by Bruce Donaldson (Routledge Press). The price difference is significant, but you get what you pay for."
4,not bad for small book,"This book is quite useful if you already have a companion pronunciation book or cd. It explains the Dutch grammar well, but for a beginner, you may wish to start with something else. Not bad as a supplement to another language book."
2,Not that good,This isn't a very good grammer book. I get slowed down by the complicated and concise language. Probably the best thing to say about this is that it is overly concise.
5,fantastic,"I bought after reading the good reviews, and it IS A GREAT KNIFE.Very sharp. Can't feel a thing when cutting to-fu. It also makes tougher cutting jobs like cutting meat much easier. My gf just loves it and now she does most of the cutting job :)The knife comes with a pretty good plastic container. My gf washes the knife every time, dries it with paper towel, and stores it back in the container.I also love the fact it's from the swiss army knife brand."
4,very good knife,"I purchased this knife after reading the review by Cook's Illustrated. It has an excellent blade and great balance. The only problem I have had is with the handle. These knives are marketed as ""dishwasher safe"" but the handle has begun to discolor after only 3-4 washings."
1,Empty Fluff and Lies -,This book is full of empty long winded paragraphs of hardly believable self-affirmations. It's insulting to think that this writer is helping women of size. Blow your boring hot air somewhere else. What a waste of money.
5,Beautiful,Great work by Madamoiselle Pettibon. The songs are great and the orchestral works are sublime. The disc is perhaps a bit short but it is well worth a purchase. You will listen often. Highly recommended.
4,A good peice of work,"I enjoyed this biography very much, but it is worth knowing about Julie Andrews' Autobiography which of course is more her point of view."
3,"rawther opiniated, yet still delightful","What's with the cover picture? I mean, I love Victor/Victoria, but Julie is a beautiful woman... why did he choose this picture? Also, there were times in the book where Windeler's personal opinion was a little offensive to me. I suppose that is alright, because he is allowed his opinion, but it seemed to me like he was bashing the movie ""Star!"", which happens to be one of my favorites. Other than the difference in opinion that occurred occasionally between the reader and the author... this book was a delightful, yet 'real' holiday about Julie Andrews. It's loaded with anecdotes and great accounts of 'The Adventures of Julie and Carol (Burnett)' (as I call them). Over all, this is a good read for the Julie Fanatic, just keep in mind that you don't always have to agree with what this biographer has to say . ;)"
4,The Sound of Julie Andrews,"SLIGHT ERROR on my reivew of Robert Windeler, JULIE ANDREWS, A LIFE ON STAGE AND SCREEN; this review was made on the HARDCOVER versiuon of the book, not the paperback (as stated on my review). Thanks for correcting this slight error ASAP. Sincerely, Robert Corbell"
2,Watch Out For Mono Tracks,"Unless you're especially enamoured of the 1952 monaural edition of Music For Lovers Only, you'll find the first album disappointing. Neither Amazon, Collectors' Choice, nor EMI Music make it clear that Music For Lovers Only (the more desirable of the two album set) is completely monaural, in spite of the fact that Capitol actually released the same album in stereo in 1959."
3,Music For Lovers Only,"To fan in Atlanta, Georgia ... yes, it is difficult to find the extended version of ""Music for Lovers Only"" but, my husband and I do own the CD with all 16 original songs including ""I Cover The Waterfront"" and other rarities. Fan in Atlanta... if you wish for me to make copy of CD to a tape for you, I would glady do that for nominal fee (cost of tape & stamps). God Bless!"
3,A little disappointing...,"Apparently, I grew up listening to the 12-inch expanded version of LOVERS ONLY, so I miss Jackie's renditions of ""I cover the Waterfront,"" ""Some day"" and ""When a Woman Loves a Man."" Can anybody tell me where I can get a recording of these tunes to help me round out my collection? Thanx."
3,"Nice music, but where's Jackie??!!","I bought this CD, because I happened upon a song on the radio the other day, sung by Jackie Gleason. It was such a sweet, poignant song, that I decided I had to immediately buy something by him. So I bought this CD, thinking it would provide a good synopsis of Jackie's best music. Then I find that Jackie is nowhwere to be found on this CD!!! It's nothing but music. To me this is very misleading. The music sure is nice, but I wanted to hear Jackie....."
3,Básico para um bom curso de engenharia elétrica.,"Trata-se de um livro que aborda os principais tópicos estudados na base da teoria eletromagnética. Exige um conhecimento matemático razoável, principalmente no que se refere a manipulao e resoluo de equaes diferenciais. Apresenta trechos de dedues que as vezes se tornam meio obscuras e que necessitam de muita ateno. Antes de comprar procure falar com pessoas que ja estudaram por ele e verifique se voc tem base matemática suficiente."
5,Trans Fat Every Where.,Trans fat takes the reader deep into the food asles of your groccery store- Buyer beware! If you step into any of the asles with food in boxes or wrapedup- your in for a really eye opener!I learned a lot of ways to cook my food diffrently after reading this book and how to shop for food. This book has brought awarness to the number one killer in our fast food world. Some of the more common foods have trans fatty particles just waiting to enter your blood stream. Highly recommend.
1,Extremely Boring and Destructive. A Work of Dumbing Down Style,"This work is ponderously navel gazing displaying the vanity and meaninglessness of identity politics divorced from larger system analyses. Another reviewer said his/her first grader could do better. I believe that most first graders ought to be able to do better than this work. Maybe I'm taking this work out of context. I come from a multicultural background myself and simply cannot relate, except to say that it's a barely competent work overall and is stylistically uninteresting. As far as identity based political works go, there is far higher quality material than this. I haven't read her other work and this text doesn't encourage me to do so. I might just experiment with something else that she's written to see if there are some other redeeming entries she's made to her body of work."
5,It is great,I love this book because it is inspirational in many ways1- you can see what youth of the modern society think about relationships2- you see tantenled youth's artistic works3- all the youth had one-to-one mentors who volunteered their time[...]
2,Not a great wiper,"I got this Anco version because it was the only decently-priced 26"" blade I could find. When I put it on however, it was wobbly and loose on the mount (but the other adjustment clip didn't fit either). Because of it's looseness, it would skip a bit across the windshield and not clean everything in it's path. I should have coughed up a few more bucks and gotten a nicer wiper."
4,They Got Every Issue in this Tiny Book?,My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
5,My Impression of this book,"This is an excellent critical analysis of an array of controversial topics. The author is objective, comprehensive and he communicates clearly all of the most prevalent perspectives on each topic. Sources of all views are provided. I respect the critical analysis with no emotional bias. Balanced, intelligent biblical explanations."
2,okay but fuzzi bunz are better,"For our first child we wanted to use cloth diapers. Because the reviews were so vaied we decided to try both the swaddlebees and the fuzzi bunz. The swaddlebees weren't very good. First small didn't fit (our baby was over 8 lbs) then when they did fit they always leaked. Also, because it is an all-in-one diaper it takes ages to dry. You would need three full sets becuase they take an entire day to dry. For new parents looking to take the cloth diaper option I would recommend the fuzzi bunz cloth diapers, the adjustable fit means you can use them from day one and because of the pocket insert they dry quickly. Hope it helps."
3,Still on the fence...,"Love the idea but mine have leaked even though I washed/dried per the website instructions. I highly recommend getting the inserts. Also, at 17.95 for the AIO and receiving mine in the same package, w/shipping it was over $22 a diaper."
2,Ok but fuzzi bunz were better,"For our first child we wanted to use cloth diapers. Because the reviews were so vaied we decided to try both the swaddlebees and the fuzzi bunz.

Hope it helps."
1,may as well not have a diaper on,"I have a 2 month old and really wanted to try cloth for her. I also felt like I needed to try a bunch of different kinds before I made a selection. I bought one of these, a couple of Happy Heinys, Kissaluvs, and BumGenius 3.0. The first and only time I put this one on her, I was nursing her, so she was laying on her side on a pillow in my lap. When I picked her up, the diaper had leaked all over the pillow, like she wasn't even wearing a diaper at all.We now use the Kissaluvs size 0 during the day, with nylon Dappi pants covers, and BumGenius at night and on-the-go, since they keep her drier. She is going to grow out of the Kissaluvs soon, at which point we will be using the BumGenius. I know that some of it depends on the shape of your baby, and our daughter has a smaller waist and pudgier legs, which these diapers don't seem to adjust to. All in all, I wouldn't recommend them."
5,"Trim, easy, adorable diaper","I love this diaper! I have a tall, skinny girl and these diapers fit her perfectly. The inside is unbelievably soft, and a hemp doubler allows me to use them at night. Thanks Swaddlebees for an excellent and easy option :)"
5,Enjoyable story of Space flight from Mercury to Apollo.,"Definately one of the top ten books about the the Apollo space program. Gives a unique historical/engeneering prospective of the US/USSR race to the Moon. It takes you from preMercury mission days to the last man on the Moon, including the nail-biting account of the Apollo 11 near disaster."
5,A Comprehensive look at the technology of Apollo,"A comprehensive look at the whole of the Apollo program is given in ""Apollo: the Race to the Moon"". As well as the flights and the astronauts, this book also looks at the technology involved - the crawler and its special roadway, the exacting requirements for the lauchpad (""Stage Zero"") to stand a Saturn launch, the problems in developing the F1 engines that powered the Saturn first stage, the power and magnificence or a Saturn launch."
2,Didn't Last,"Worked excellently for a few weeks. After that the black fabric on the back began to peel off and the leather covering around the holes for the belt stripped back, making the holes too large for the buckle's knob to hold it closed. It's not leather all the way through, the center is made up of some sort of foam. Again, excellent for a brief period, but did not withstand normal use."
4,90% GOOD....,"I thought this book was pretty cool, it had the whole ""future with no privacy or real reality"" plotline like The Matrix or 1984. The story was great and the writing was excellent, but the names were a little hard to read and I thought the ending was bad. The book's ending was so up in the air that it might as well have not been there. but other than that the book was exceptional and I recommend it to anyone who liked The Matrix or 1984."
4,"Great espresso, but poor product lifespan","We've had the Bosch B20 espresso maker for over 5 years. In general, it is easy to use and makes great coffee/espressos with a good crema. We've used it daily for 4-10 shots a day over 5 years, so I would guess we have somewhere around 15000 shots poured. But... it seems to be designed to have a 5 year lifespan, which is disappointing for a $1000+ appliance. After 3-4 years, the thermoblock and pump failed. It cost around $250 to replace those. Now, we are having the same problem again. I've been diligent about doing the preventative maintenance including descaling on a regular basis.Prior to this, I briefly owned Delonghi and Saecco espresso makers, and both were returned to the store when the failed in the first 6 months. So the Bosch outlasted the others. But still... I don't spend $1000 on a refrigerator or dishwasher and expect it to fail after 5 years.I'm going to look at other brands this time."
1,terrible coffee machine,"I owe a coffee machine Bosch Benvenuto Classic Thermoblock. Bed maintenance from Bosch and machine is really not good...When grinding the coffee it smells burnt plastic and the coffee tastes de same. Sent it to Bosch under guarantee, they said the machine was perfect and I had to pay EUR 70 for having asked for it to be fixed (had to pay for a taxi, so to say).I complained to the Bosch HQ and did not even got a reply.My advice, buy any other machine but NOT Bosch."
1,A mistake,"Want to know what a $1000 cup of coffee taste like? I still do. Against my better judgment I forked out a grand for a coffee maker to make my wife happy for Christmas. It was dead on arrival, just flashing fault codes. After messing with it for a weekend, I called Bosch hot line as instructed right on the machine. No trouble shooting, no advice from them, just a phone number of a repair shop apparently somewhere in NY. No thanks. I did not pay that kind of money to have a repaired machine. Back to Amazon it went. We bought a $140 keurig a few days ago and so far like it pretty well and we can buy a lot of coffee for the difference in money.Bosch makes good tools, I own some. This ain't one of them. Customer support? There is none."
2,operational uncertainties for Bosch Benvenuto B20 coffee machine,"Is the machine being unpredictable or can I not find the proper way to operate it? Keeping the machine ""on"" with the top button lit, I slightly tap it to get it started. The second button then lights up flashing and when it is solid, I press it.Sometimes it makes an (unwanted) espresso or just hot water. On other occasions it produces the desired cup of coffee. Also, the screen asks for water or coffee when it has been sufficiently supplied. Furthermore, the machine seems to ""prefer"" ground coffee over beans. With coffee beans in the right place, the screen still asks for more coffee and only starts when I put ground coffee in."
4,Close but not a complete greatest hits.,"Owning most of their material, this looks like a pretty good collection, but the omission of Adrenaline Rush, probably their biggest hit is almost unpardonable. So, not a bad collection if you don't own any leatherstrip, but it's missing some good tracks."
3,Not the best performance of this symphony,"I like Bernstein, and this performance does have some charm to it. However, the rhythms are too choppy, the tempo changes too often, and there is not enough mystery. If you can find it, the very best performance of the Mahler 4th is by Leopold Ludwig and the Staatskapelle Dresden. It was recorded way back in 1957 and remains the best available interpretation, in my opinion. You can read my review of that CD for more details."
3,"Useful, although outdated","I disagree with other reviews that recommend you don't waste your money on it. I know of no other book that provides the information that this one does, and found it extremely useful when shopping for a BMW. I wish it included a table (which I ended up creating myself) of ""Buy/Don't Buy"" models.If you don't know about BMWs, it is useful."
1,Desperately needs a rewrite,"This was probably a fine book when it was first written in the early 1980s, but it's been badly (cheaply?) updated since. It's now almost incoherent -- certainly not up to the standard set by some of the (excellent) other books in this series (Corvette, Mercedes, Ferrari). Needs a cover-to-cover rewrite, done by someone knowledgable. Don't waste your money until it happens."
3,PaulG's review,"I tend to agree with other reviewer about this book needing to be completely rewritten. Even though it was revised in 1994, the author still makes references to things occuring in 1987 ""at current press time."" Clearly, the original text wasn't revised. If the book was revised in 1994, these type of references should has been eliminated. Other than the text being out of date, the book itself has a lot of worthwhile information. The author rates the collectability (if that's a word) of each of the cars using a five star system."
4,"Great value, requires a good amp","These speakers are a great value. I've had them about two years now. They would be good for aspiring audiophiles, except they require a really powerful (i.e. expensive) amp to drive them properly. I use an old NAD 7600 and really get wonderful results. They are faithful, with a pretty level response across the whole tonal range, and the imaging is good.I wouldn't say they look ""cheap"", but some of the auxillary parts are flimsy compared to more expensive speakers. As primary stereo speakers, they're in the sub-audiophile range but still sound great and are fun to play with. I would definitely recommend them for anyone who's interested in hi-fi audio but not really sure if they're willing to spend the thousands of dollars necessary to get a real audiophile setup."
2,Don't be fooled,"Once you compare these speakers, you too will agree that they are GROSSLY overrated. They are cheap-looking, very light and flimsy, and are made of plastic and vinyl. They sound about average. After several comparisons, I bought the new Polk Audio RTI4 which are EXCELLENT in every comparison -- solid wood construction, great-looking, and SUPERIOR sound quality."
3,Solid,"The book is solid, informative and exhaustive. However, the structuring of chapters is often a little unwieldy and difficult to follow. With a slightly modified format, this book would be a lot easier to read."
2,OK,"This title is a little short, but the content seems ok on the controversial figure of Martin Luther."
5,Praise for Martin Marty's Martin Luther,"Well written and succinct. I am new to Luther and wanted a good starting point. He covers the chronology of Luther's life (including regional history), as well as highlights of his major writings. Dr. Marty's work will be an important part of my library."
4,Nice and short,"Not as comprehensive as Roland H. Bointon's ""Here I Stand"". But it will do the job if your time for Martin Luther is very limited. Marty Martin concentrates on providing the reader with an insight into Martin Luther's inner experience."
3,Martin Luther,"I'm not a Luther authority, but I was raised in the Lutheran church, so much of this is covered in our confirmation studies. It was a good review for me, and it a=can be a good introduction for others interested in this historical figure.We studied Luther's theology and the reformation movement in confirmation, but they never covered his personal life much. Luther was rather lusty once he married. I'm a bit surprised that so much is known of his love life, though he must have enjoyed writing about it.Sex aside, this is a good book and worthy of a look. I doubt many churches will include it in their teachings, but there is always more information for those who seek it."
3,Beautiful pictures,"Sophie gets to an age where she leaves her home and sets off to find a better place. Each person she meets, tries to do away with her even though she is not a mean spider. The last place she finds is perfect in every way. As Sophie gets older, the young woman who lives in the room was making things for her unborn baby but was unable to complete the blanket, so Sophie uses her last spin to weave a blanket for the child."
3,This book is gentle!,"Sophie is spider. She is an artist.She is on the move to weave.She meets a young woman.She makes hers masterpiece.Sophie is gentle and miserable.I look like the book is poor , miserable and dark.Finally , it have warm and gentle.I look like the illustration is dynamic and modern.Human is realistic , but Sophie is not real.View is beautiful.Eriko and Mikie"
4,touching tale and elegant illustration,I recommend this to anyone who has a fear of spiders or is trying to teach more compassion to their children related to any subject. Beautifully illustrated and a very touching story.
3,Nice shade,We have this shade in our baby's nursery. We didn't purchase the matching base for the shade because of cost. It is on a white lamo base. The only thing we didn't like about the shade is that the pink butterflies on the shade almost look a peachy color rather than the pink that matches the wallborder. Use also can't use smaller light bubls with the shade because the shade tilts. It's an okay product.
3,"If you want to know the blues, window shopping only for this one","Overall the recordings are rather meh. Muddy Waters has several recordings here, and they just sound luke warm to me, a term I would never use to describe MW. There's a recording or Georgia by Ray Charles which he plays in rubado, as a result it just drags and drags with no groove. There's no delta blues, Chicago is poorly represented.... If you own a restaurant this is probably perfect.You're better off picking the names off the jacket here, and then searching out great recordings by the artists. The blues are lot more moving than this collection."
5,This is a great price for an upgrade! You just have to,"If you have the Adobe video collection Pro then getting this upgrade is a no-brainer. What were seeing as Adobe integrate each of these components into a complete whole video editing production suite. So if you have the Adobe video collection, professional 1.0 that upgrade now.

5,Great CD!,I ordered this CD because I thought I lost the one I originally bought years ago when it first came out. I enjoyed listening to it when it first arrived. I found the first one I bought after cleaning out the guest bedroom. I decided to pass it off to a friend to enjoy also.
3,not that great,This CD is just okay. If you are a Levert fan then I'm sure you will love this. I however was less than moved with this one.
4,It is really For Real Tho',"This cd is one that has stood the test of time. As I listen to it the other day, it brought back those thoughts of growing up in the 80's. From the first cut to the last, the Leverts demand respect just as their father did with the O'Jays. This cd is really ""For Real Tho' and I highly recommended it!"
4,"A life can be repeated, if only you are a monster","The concept of time folding in and repeating itself, retracing ones own steps, spreads throughout this book. Starting with a woman lead to the gallows, her last words ""Here we go again"", echo strangely.An excellent read, funny, scary, tragic, enthralling. Recommended."
4,Thought provoking and gripping,An excellent twisting novel that leads the reader further in to understand the depths of the characters minds. I loved the academic references and the almost parallel stories that work in partnership. I will have to read it again..soon
3,Great writing but left me a bit cold.,"Peter Ackroyd is a great writer. His seemless mixture of styles, techniques, a brooding sense of place and time jumps creates some of the best fiction being written today. However, that being said, I find that this novel left me out and did not engage or make me care about any of the characters. The same complaint has been made about Stanley Kubrick's movies. I can appreciate the master's touch, but it is sometimes too cold."
5,Sold the car for scrap,"I am tired of writing what other knows already, so I am just going to cut and paste this version of exciting comment and review to everyone to read and gets the same boring imagination. Yea! Goog! wove it"
5,It was touching and just a wonderful book.,It was a touching book that brought me to tears. If you have pets this book will really relate to you. IT unbelievably shows the unmistakable bond with which you share with your pet.
5,Wonderful book.,"This book should be on everyone Kindle. It will make you laugh, cry,and give you inspiration and hope for trouble times. Our pets are truly a gift from God and the stories in this book tell us just that. I would recommend it to everyone."
4,Amazing Stories,"I really enjoyed this book. The main reason I liked it is because it is all about cats and dogs, and I am a hardcore animal lover. Another reason I liked it is because the stories are not made up in someone's mind. These stories are real stories that real people lived through. The last reason I liked this book so much is because you don't have to read it like an ordinary book. You can read it like I did and just jump around to stories that sound good to you, instead of reading the book cover to cover."
4,T. Rex Box Set,"This is a good T. Rex collection which only contains three CD's. The songs here are great, but ""Bang A Gong"" is missing as are their very early material. For someone that is sick of the over radio-played hit, and just wants the best of T. Rex from the 70s, this CD collection will be for you. At the end of disc three there is a very good radio broadcast of some of their biggest hits which is nice. This comes in a nice 6 x 12 box."
1,Not my cup of tea.,"I am sorry to say, for me, this film fails on almost every level.First, as a satire (or even a comedy) about theater, it lacks much insight into the theater beyond a few references to the whole ""Scottish play"" taboo and a couple nearly-amusing types (melodramatic director, nerdy stage manager). Second, as a romantic comedy, it lacks heart, likable characters, and emotional appeal. Third, the acting is shockingly bad, particularly for a film about theater. Finally, this film is thoroughly uninteresting. For a satire about theater culture, look to Waiting for Guffman. For romantic comedies... I don't know, Love Actually?"
4,"Or, 2 stars if you're not into, and knowlegable of, live theater","One of the oldest, and least logical, of theater superstitions is that you're never supposed to utter the name of ""the Scottish play"" backstage as it will bring bad luck. This is the saga of a hapless young man who does just that and the luck (bad AND good) that befalls him. As a dramedy it leaves some (o.k. many) things to be desired. A coherent or even reasonably believable plot (and NO, I'm not talking about the ghosts. I'm fine with them)for one. However, as a view of life backstage in a small theater company, it couldn't be much better. If you love theater, this flick is for you. If not... not."
5,Hunter Fans,"I have always liked the Hunter TV Series and I am excited to watch the whole series again. If't w you are a Hunter Fan, you won't want to miss out this!"
4,Hunter: The Complete Series,"When I was younger I wasn't that into Hunter, but recently i bought season one and found I enjoyed it so I then decided to get the complete series and I have had no regrets. I am enjoying the rest as much as the first season. This is a good deal for the price."
5,One though cop!,"Some 25 years ago, I got across Sgt Hunter way and got hooked up! This show is really action packed and when an episode is finished, you can't wait for the next one! Unlike the time the show was on TV, now you don't have to wait one week for the next episode! Thank's to this offering, you have not only the first season but all the seasons in one box set! despite the age of original film, image and sound are great and it come out great on today's TV. The binder contains several DVD wich are all in individual pockets. These pockets actually protect the DVDs while all the pockets are contained in a frame inside the binder. Just be carefull when you open the binder (case) to make sur no pocket fall on the floor. I want to say thanks for this offering wich will help me see the entire ""Hunter"" serie wich was among one of my favorite show the."
3,HUNTER COMPLETE SERIES,"I HAVE HAD OTHER ONES FROM MILL CREED AND THEY ALL HAD DISCS THAT WOULD NOT PLAY RIGHT.THIS ONE IS THE SAME SEASON 4 DISC 3 SEASON 5 DISC 3 SEASON 7 DISC 3 & 4 ALL HAD NOISE IN THE BACK GROUNDSEASON 6 DISC 1 & 4 WON'T PLAY AT ALLI DON'T WANT MY MONEY BACK, BECAUSE I REALLY ENJOY THE SERIES.I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY ASSISTANCE FROM YOU TO SOLVE MY PROBLEM. I.E. REPLACEMENT DISCS AS ABOVE OR A COMPLETE NEW SET)THANK YOU"
5,Finally!,I met Stephen Cannell at a book signing a year ago and asked him when are you going to release the rest of the Hunter series. He said it was coming and he delivered. The only thing that stinks is I have seasons 1-3. Great series.
1,"not good, do not buy it.",Truthfully the item was not new. so how can your lie like that. real ugly item indeed. i was not happy at all. i want my money back now.
3,Packaging sucks,"I absolutely love Hunter and it was difficult not giving it five stars but the packaging was crap. Also, I'm watching season 7 right now and the audio is terrible. I would of thought that the quality gets better with the newer seasons but this wasn't the case. Overall I am glad I bought it. I hope they release the movies next."
4,Packaging of DVD's,I have already purchased S1 and S2 put out by Mill Creek. S2 has the same bad packaging that the complete 7 season package does. May I suggest you do what I did and buy a package of DVD cases that hold 2 DVD's per case. Staples has some very nice slim line cases that hold 2 DVD's. I scanned the case cover and then made copies of it for each of those cases. I wrote on each one of the covers what season and disc numbers was in that case. This way the DVD's are protected from being scratched and you know what season and disc are in each case without going thru all of the paper sleeves looking for the one you may want to watch. The DVD cases will cost you $20 for the 20 cases in a package but it is better than risking the damage to your DVD's. If there are 4 disc per season then you would only need 14 DVD cases and 2 cases per season would work out nicely. That is what I am going to do with the complete Season set.
5,Christmas Present,"I bought this collection for my wife for Christmas. She was a HUGE Hunter fan. We watched the first 4 episodes that night. She said it had been so long since she watched Hunter that the episodes seemed like new, with no commercials. Quality is excellent, menu manuvering is easy. I saw this same item in a well known ""discount"" catalogue, and Amazon was much less expensive. Thanks again Amazon! A must buy for Hunter fans."
3,Hunter Series,Hunter was one of our favorite TV crime series. But the DVDs in this set are NOT very good. They freeze up over and over again... and some of them won't play at all. I WOULD NOT recommend this set to anyone!!!!!
1,Individual Seasons,"Miles Creek needs to put the seasons out induvidualy. I bought the first 3 put out by Anchor Bay in 2005 & 2006. To me this would be a rip-off for the studios to put out only a few seasons then come out with the complete series. I have already invested $90.00 in my 3 Seasons and now you can get all 7 under $90 something needs to be done about this. Just another Con from the studios. Also if I was to purchase this complete set, I could not get anyone to buy the 3 seasons I originaly purchase so I just loose money."
5,The Hunter Series was Wonderful,"I loved this whole series due to the acting and the bonding between Hunter and his partner. Good acting and excellentplots, very good pick for your money."
2,Some of the programs don't play,"I was delighted to quickly receive this package of discs which were supposed to contain all of Hunter's shows. Well, to make a long story short, all of the discs were there, but they didn't all work. For example, almost half of the episodes on disc # 2 were unplayable. The rest of the dics seem playable, so I'm not going to take the time to send the package back. I guess it's not the worst thing in the world, but it is irratating."
4,Good news/ Bad news,"The good news is you get all seven seasons of a 1980s network TV show for a great price. The bad news is a) there are no extras, including no subtitles, b) the packaging is only just adequate (but space-saving), and c) the disc quality is marginal; the first disc we watched has freezes and drop-outs. Other reviewers have indicated that the episodes vary in length, indicating editting, and some of the music has been replaced presumably for copyright reasons.So, if you are looking for a collector-grade set, this is not for you. But, if you just want lots of TV at a great price, you should be happy with this set."
2,Hunter The Complete Series,I am glad that they released the complete series but the packing stinks. On a scale of 0 to 10 I give the packing a 0! Every time I open the case out come a bunch of black sleeves with dvds in them. If you spend the money for this set and the dvds are worth it spend a little more and buy some slim dvd cases and throw the crappy packaging away. This is a bare bones set just the dvds no extras.
4,Hunter: The Complete Series,"The product is of good quality, although the discs are just piled on top of one another. As long as the quality is good, I don't suppose it matters that much."
4,Hunter,"Although I am very happy to have this series, I am disappointed with the sound quality and the fact that it is not close captioned. It was in the condition described and arrived very promptly."
5,Good seller.,"I receviced my DVD Hunter: The Complete Series fast. It is a Christmas and I know that my son will love watching it. And so will my husband and me. Great seller fast service, I am just a little slow at getting my reviews back sometimes but I do get to all of my reviews. Thanks to everyone whom I have bought from."
5,Awesome!,"This book is awesome!! Reading it has helped me make some very important changes in my life.... but most importantly in my thinking!! Who would have ever thought..""I CAN change my thinking!"" Things that seemed SO serious, terrible or just plain unfair, now are just things that are called ""life"".Although I may not like certain things, I certainly don't let them run my thoughts, my feelings or my life! This book is so thought provoking. It makes you feel excited and wanting to do more for yourself! It nudges you gently to put action into your wants, dreams and hopes.If you feel ""stuck"" like I did ( in my thinking, my life, my not knowing what to do to change etc) you owe it to yourself to give an honest try and this terrfic book WILL help you do it at your own pace.I can't put it down.... I just keep re-reading parts of it to re-enforce my new thinking ways!Thank you to the author for helping me ""escape"" my own entrapments!"
5,Just Adorable:,I gave this as a gift for our unborn garandson and it was loved by the soon to be parents. Thank you.
2,Unhappy with Mobile-overpriced,"My husband and I bought the mobile ""Jake"" because it matched our bedding, lamp, etc. We were pretty disappointed in the quality and usefulness of the mobile. We thought it was way overpriced at almost $50. While it does play music, the music only last for about 2 minutes and came out sounding shrill and high-pitched. It wasn't soothing or comforting at all- I couldn't wait for it to stop playing, so I can't imagine my baby (not born yet) would enjoy such a high pitched sound. The animals that hang from the mobile are okay, but there is only 4, with no mirrors or soft lights. The best thing to say about the mobile is that it was easy to put together (we mounted it on the crib, but there is also a wall mount option). Ultimately, we decided to return it and look for something that plays better music for a better price."
5,"Easy to install, very nice!","I bought this mobile right after I purchased the sheet set. It matches very well and was not that hard to install, my husband was able to have it up and running in about 6 minutes."
3,Not for convertible cribs,"We got this to match our bedding set. When I went to install it on our convertible crib, I ended up putting scratches on my crib. I bought the convertible crib for a reason...to grow with my baby. Now, I have visible damage on his white crib. My husband had to put a piece of plastic under the mobile to prevent further scratching. Pay attention when looking for a mobile...Better yet, try it on your crib before buying."
3,Good but not great...,"I enjoyed reading this book though it was too long. I kept going to the end because I was somewhat compelled in the early going with the main character, Rulan, and wanted to see how the story would conclude. Too many unnecessary details, and after beginning somewhat slowly, the story moves too fast in the final third of the book, and it is easy for the reader to lose focus. All in all worthwhile but not a knockout."
2,too many pages,"This book only held my interest intermittantly and was entirely too long!! It should have been at least half as large a book as it is. Finally gave up in the middle, too much superfluous info.Unable to keep reading due to being bored with all the silly detail."
2,Plant,This one didn't do too good. It was wilted when I got it and I followed instructions but it still died. It was very hot temps when I ordered it so I am in the fault of buying it at a bad time.
4,Yes It Is Large,"I read other reviews before purchasing. They said the bag was larger than expected; so, I was not overly surprised. I carry both the keyboard and the stand in the bag. I wrap a blanket around the keyboard to protect it from the stand. The 88 Key Casio keyboard would get lost in the bag without the stand."
2,faulty strap,I had a problem with the shoulder strap. It came loose from the body of the case causing my keyboard to drop to the ground.
2,Waaaay too big,"I got this hoping it would fit my Casio 88 key keyboard (Which is quite large) and this was still to big for it. This is definately made for the big stage pianos, not smaller ""personal"" keyboards. I will probably be returning this item."
5,Great book to take to China during your adoption!,Great book to take to China during your adoption!I took this book with me to China during the adoption of our daughter. I used it like a yearbook having everyone I came into contact with sign it or write in it.The story is priceless.
1,It's a bad book .,"it's not possible at all that the Chinese don't love their children.In China,chilren are regarded ""the young king""or ""the small sun"".all the family members try their best to present food ,clothing and education to their kids .The love them even more than the Americans do.Are there campus-gunkilling in China?never! It's simple-minded to say China parents don't love children.As long as the human being ,children are his or her part of life.What does the nationality matter?"
4,Positive presentation with a bit of fairy tale mixed in.,"I found this book to be a positive story with many truths. I take exception to the presentation of the parents ""loving"" their daughter so much that they want the best for her.As an adoptive parent of a beautiful Chinese daughter, I don't want her to think that her birthmother was a fairy godmother, or a movie star who will come get her some day.The truth that China is a male dominated society and the mothers are sometimes forced to abandon the girls due to political & family presure is not presented.I much prefer the book, ""Why Was I Adopted""."
4,comedy pack DVD,dumb but very funny there is not a whole lot to say about these movies its people smoking weed getting high and acting dumb. funny as H@#$ will be watching again well worth the money.
5,How About What the Composer Wanted?,"Gershwin, Kern, Berlin, even Victor Herbert share the questionable distinction of having been ""improved"" upon by subsequent arrangers until the music becomes frozen and dead (funeral march arrangements of Blue Skies), or so ""Jazzed up"" that it is a distortion in the other direction. Joan and Morris and William Bolcom ""honor"" all that is in the music of Irving Berlin by performing it in an honest and polished manner that relies only on those qualities to ""sell"" the songs. John Wilson, Musicologist"
2,"Product not received, refund issued","I was disappointed that this cd never arrived. However, the company followed through with a refund."
3,Slim Collection for the Price,"All of her biggest solo hits and duets are here, but why so expensive? For that price, more tracks should have been added."
2,Softly with this cheese...,"I hadn't heard much from Roberta Flack before I got this CD. She was well before my time, but I thought she had a nice sound when I heard her in one of those ""so you're getting old and want to hear the music of your foregone youth"" commercials. I still like her voice, but after the first few tracks, every song sounds like it belongs in the background for the credits of a cheesy romance movie from the 80s. In the duets especially (with Peabo Bryson and Maxi Priest), the male singer is just spewing Velveeta into the microphone. I found myself looking at the CD player to see how much longer I'd have to listen to each track.""The First Time..."", ""Will you still love me..."" and ""killing me softly"" are the only songs I'll listen to again.If these three songs make it worth your while, if you love Roberta Flack, or if you just don't have enough cheese in your musical diet, this is an album to get."
5,Love It!,Roberta Flack has voice as smooth as silk. To have every one of her hits on one CD is absolutely fabulous. I love to listen to this CD when I tidy up the my house during the weekend or when I have company. Her and Donnie Hathaway compliment each other so well. First Time Ever I Saw Your Face is my favorite song. I'll recommend this CD to everyone.Love It!
4,"Beautiful songs, wonderful voice, horrible quality!","This CD is a must-have! Roberta Flack's voice is beautiful, and never more so than on Killing Me Softly, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, Oasis, Tonight I Celebrate My Love, Will You Still Love Me, So It Goes, and Set the Night to Music. This is one of those CDs where you put it on and realize that you like nearly ever song on it. The only reason I gave this CD 4 stars instead of 5 is because the sound quality is not very good at all. It certainly doesn't sound remastered, in fact when I play this disc on my CD player, I have to turn the volume up a lot just to hear the songs. But until they release a new, truly remastered version, you can't go wrong with this CD!"
5,Great!,"Roberta Flack is a great musician, and I hope that she'll make another album someday. The songs on this CD are all great. The standouts for me are ""Where Is The Love"", ""Killing Me Softly"", ""Making Love"", ""Tonight I Celebrate My Love"" and ""The Closer I Get To You"".My very favorite is track #7, a duet ballad with Peabo Bryson called ""More Than Everything"". It's gorgeous in every way."
3,So-so,"I bought this solely for ""Killing Me Softly"" and it's definitely the best song on the CD. I've played this a few times in my car and found that I had to virtually eliminate the Bass and really boost the Treble and the volume to be able to hear it okay. If I had to do it all over again, I probably wouldn't buy this CD."
3,"I Still Got Love For Roberta, But...","...I'm just not feeling the entire CD. I got the CD because my *favorite* songs were on there (1-6 and 9). Seeing that this is Roberta Flack and all, I thought the rest of the CD would be just as wonderful as it was in the beginning, but it wasn't. The songs toward the end of the CD sound like she was just chillin' at home, jamming on a keyboard in her bathrobe. I never really liked the song ""Tonight, I Celebrate My Love"" with Peabo Bryson; it's too corny and mushy for my liking. Roberta is actually before my time, so I may not have a profound appreciation for her like older people do. She has a nice voice and style, but the CD is only worth getting if you're a die-hard fan. But if you really think it's worth having because of the first six songs then I guess it would be worth it too."
4,No one can match her.,"Roberta Flack is my favorite artist. She has a pure, sweet, clear, and pristine voice that is not matched by anyone in today's recording industry. I shudder to think what Mariah Carey would do to her classics given a chance. Roberta's music is legendary and is frequently redone by other artists, but never mastered. Sorry, Lauryn!There are so many hits. Like another reviewer, I also recommend that a serious fan purchase the individual albums if they really want what isn't included here. One song I think of is ""Jesse."" It's sad and melancholy, but hey, sometimes that's what you want to hear.I love her duets with Donnie Hathaway and Peabo Bryson, but the duet with Maxi Priest is great too. She is a good collaborator which adds to her professional image. This CD is good to rotate with Sade, Erykah Badu, Les Nubians, Sarah Vaughn, Ella Fitzgerald, and Billie Holiday."
5,Softly With These Spngs,"T have always loved ""The first Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" from the first time I heard it. No one can sing it like Roberta Flack. I enjoy all of her songs. This disk is very relaxing to me. Very sexy!"
3,Remaster,"Roberta Flack deserved a far better remastering of her lovely songs than is represented by this inferior product. The equalization is poor overall, but in Killing Me Softly the bass amplification is a crime. I will be more cognizant of Joe Gastwirt's work on future labels."
3,Not too bad,"This movie wasn't too bad at all. The actors weren't awful, the cinematography was very good and the plot works. It's a little cliche but hey, who cares?! I thought it was well done and had that jump factor I was looking for in a slasher movie. I thought the woman coulda been scarier looking, and the ending was a little bit too predictable. Pop some popcorn and settle down for this decent little flick."
3,Buy this if you are a novice videogame collector,"The book is very good. It contains a nice price guide and a history + information on the consoles, game cartridges and arcade games. There's even tips on auction buying and more. My only complaint is that the arcade game prices are very very unrealistic. If I could find working arcade games for $50-150 my basement and garage would be overloaded. Many arcade games are listed with this price range and that is simply wrong. At least in Michigan it's hard to find any working arcade game for under $1,000."
1,Unbelievable!,"I have played musical instruments for over 40 years and never have I gotten--before this one-- a ""delux"" carrying bag with absolutely no pockets for ancillary items, picks, capo and the like. This carrying case is a scandal."
3,Good for the price,"I agree with the other reviewer, it would be nicer with pockets etc, but for the price it works well enough. I've got my picks in a plastic baggie. The electronic tuner in a ole chunk of foam rubber and everything goes in the bag...No problem"
3,"VERY WELL DONE ""DOCUMENTARY ""ON BIG BROTHER","very good documentary on big brother and the holding company,my major interest was good vintage concert footage, so the highlight for me personaly were the four uninterrupted songs in the ""extra"" section of this dvd,three of the four i consider ""very rare"" as i have never seen them anywhere else,(b+w footage but great quality),please understand however that the bulk of this dvd is a documentary,one i consider very well done,but remember a ""documentary"" not a live concert film.***i think serious fans will enjoy having this in their collection.***"
2,POOR SOUND QUALITY,The Big Brother documentary part was fair the Janis live stuff is very poor quality sound and picture buyer beware.
3,so-so dvd,I have seen most of the contents in this DVD. There was nothing really new or exciting in it. Of course it is always great to see Joplin perform but it didn't warrant purchasing.
2,not so much...,1. i love documentaries2. i enjoy bbathc3. this documentary is just not well put together. it's only an hour and i didn't get through half of it. very boring.
1,DOCUMENTARIES STINK!,"If amazon had indicated that this was a docu-DVD I would not have purchased it! One does not really get to see the artist performing except for clips from here and there. The remaining band members tell their history from how they got their name and when and how Janis joined the Holding Company, interesting but to much talking and to little music!Unless you are into documentaries - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD!"
4,Weller gets sentimental,"A wonderfully sweet song about the love for his daughter leah which deserved some airplay which is hard to get these days with the airwaves clutterd with teen pop. paul weller remains as one of the uk,s greatest songwriters who may never be recognised in the u.s.a"
2,"Decent book, but you must understand its purpose first","This book is for only a few type of repairs and for a few type of dishwashers. It will only help with the most basic repairs. (Replacing a dishrack for one example) Also, if you have a dishwasher with the electronic (digital) timer, forget this book, it won't help at all. Furthermore, there is a chance that your type of dishwasher will not be mentioned (at all) in this book; mine was not. I had a problem with a drain flapper and this book did not help at all with this problem. In fact, my brand of dishwasher had a diagram of the pump/motor assembly in the book but it did not match at all with my actual assembly."
4,flex ratchet wrench 21mm,"it work pretty good, i use it every day at work and i have not problem with it so far."
5,"A ""must-read"" for parents considering Homeschooling","The WORLDWIDE GUIDE TO HOMESCHOOLING is the most condensed and potent synopsis for any parent considering the homeschooling option. This is a must read for those who wish to have more control over their children's education. The statistics and references Dr. Ray presents document the phenomenal success achieved by literally thousands of homeschooling families. Although 87% of America's children are educated in the public schools, this age-segregated method is proving to be inefficient and increasingly ineffective when compared with parent-led education.For parents currently homeschooling, the book will help instill and invigorate you with vision and hope as well as provide new educational resources and teaching techniques you may not have been aware of."
5,Finally found this!,"I have been trying to find this CD for years, there are several CDs out there with the same title, but no resemblance to this one. I grew up listening to these Christmas carols, and loved the bells! This must have been 50 years ago, so it's amazing to finally find this after all this time. I am so glad that they released it on CD and MP3. Wonderful memories, I am buying this today, and hope that my grandkids can gain some wonderful memories from these beautiful carols, as well!"
2,Still not the one I remember,"This is close to what I've been looking for but this has heavy organ music with it. I one I remember was just the sound of heavy bells. The cover had evergreens in snow, I think."
5,Beautiful and functional,"This is a beautiful pot, with great style and color. It's just as functional as the more expensive French model, but without the high price. The white interior stains a bit, but I still like it because the white makes it easy to see changes in sauce or roux color. A wonderful addition to my kitchen!"
2,Beautiful but chips and stains,"I purchased this Dutch Oven because it is beautiful and the price is mid-range. When I got it home I washed it by hand, handling it very carefully, and placed it in a plastic strainer while I washed the lid. I had thoroughly inspected it coming out of the box, it was fine, after washing it had two chips in the handle. Cooking with it is great, it retains the heat well, heats evenly and the lid is snug, but the third washing produced another chip on the curve of the bottom and the interior stained. I went back to the store where I purchased this Dutch Oven and was told except for two (one being mine), all the others sold were returned. While this Dutch Oven is still usable I didn't want to have to check it for new chips every time I use it; I've replaced it with a Lodge enamel covered 6-quart Dutch Oven which provides the same benefits in cooking but doesn't chip or stain. The price for the Lodge was half of what I paid for this one."
3,Already Chipped,"Distributes heat evenly. Food doesn't stick! Nice and heavy. Metal knob on the lid (instead of plastic) makes popping into the oven simple and thoughtless. My only complaint is that despite hand-washing and careful handlng, the pot already has a small chip on the edge. Disappointing."
1,"The pot chips, stains, and doesn't have a truly flat bottom","I handle this pot well and only wash it with regular dish detergent, yet, a large piece of enamel chipped off the bottom edge without any damage done on my part. Also, the wrought iron is exposed along the edges of both the pot and the lid, so rust can drip down if it's not entirely dry. The inside bottom has a defect where the iron comes up, out of the enamel coating. Additionally, the inside bottom of this pot is not entirely flat, but raised in the middle. I should never have bought this pot and would reccomend that if you want a good enameled pot, you pay more and get it from a more reliable company. The pot is a cheap rendition of what an enameled pot should be, and you will pay for it in the end. Put your money elsewhere."
4,"simple but elegant, warm and comfortable","I was a little bit worried about the size of this boots when I ordered because one of the reviews said they are slightly bigger than their actual size. Fortunately, my boots just fit. Simple but elegant, warm and comfortable. The only flaw is they are slightly tighten around calf. Good buy though."
3,nice style,the boots are nice but the material from which it was made of is not that good. they are fashionable but sizes are slightly bigger than what they are suppose to fit. good buy though
5,Marine Speakers,I have 3 pairs of these now...all in Marine environments. Great sound and very durable...outpreforms other more expensive speakers.
1,Worst speakers I ever bought,I bought these and within a week the grills started to rust. What a joke and DONT BUY THEM.......BUYER BEWARE.............DONT BE A SUCKER LIKE ME....PYLE PLMR54 5.25-Inch 300 Watt Two Way Sealed Speaker System
4,The Rest of The Best,"(Note: If you don't own the first boxed set this rating doesn't apply, and you should get that first).First off, let me say that if you don't already own the boxed set listed above, or a considerable amount of Zeppelin's albums don't buy this. Consequently, if you do own either of those, then get this without dealy, especially if you own the other boxed set. This is the perfect way to complete a Zeppelin collection. Since this is the ""leftovers"" some songs on here are throwaways, but as we all know, Led Zeppelin didn't make many crappy songs, so many of the tracks on here are great. In fact, there are some real gems, The Lemon Song, Living Loving..., Moby Dick, and Good Times Bad Times for example. Also, as on the previous box, the remastering is incredible. This is especially evident on Good Times Bad Times and Black Mountainside. Put simply: it's the perfect way to complete your Zep colllection."
3,Zep Box 2 Ain't Perfect,"You have to give this collection some credit, since it is lacking something. I think that's because it's just leftovers from Box Set 1.But it still provides some good listening.This solid Led Zeppelin collection is for die-hard fans."
5,"No ""Left Overs"" Here, ""Bring It On Home""!","Before The Dave Matthews Band there was Led Zeppelin experimenting with various musical styles. Tracks like ""Boogie With Stu"", ""Down By The Seaside"", and ""Carouselambra"" are examples of Zep's diversity and show that they are not just a ""heavy metal"" or a blues band.I particularly liked the fact that ""Black Mountain Side"" is a stand alone track without the cross-fading of ""Your Time Is Gonna Come"". The art work is spectacular and the booklet is just as interesting as ""Boxed Set"".This set is highly recommended, there are no ""left-overs"" here. It is a good mix of rockers, blues, folk, and (do I dare say) world beat (pre-90's of course). You won't be disappointed with this set, add it to your collection at once!"
5,THIS IS THE BEST!!!!,"I have to say for my fiance to say that this displays the best of Led Zeppelin, thats when i know i did good!!! Thanx!!!!"
2,Broke After 6 months,"I loved this TV! It kept me company in the kitchen all day while I cooked, cleaned, and folded clothes. Unfortunately, my house is very quiet lately because my favorite kitchen gadget broke! I went to turn it on the other day, and it worked for about 10 seconds, then went black -- and I can't get it to turn back on. It's a great value, but ""you get what you pay for!"""
2,Lemon,I loved this item while it worked and had almost a year of good tuning and dvd play but one day the tv went black of course my receipt is more than faded and magnavox was no help
5,It Works,We found Cactus Juice 12 years ago while on a camping trip in Florida. The mosquitoes were ferocious and this stuff worked. It has a nice citrus smell and isn't greasy. We use it as a bug repellent and sunscreen. It does a great job at both. Since it isn't sold near us we have been ordering it online ever since. It also makes a great gift.
1,"Accuracy, Please!","To be useful, a guidebook to canoeing trails must be accurate and complete in directing the reader and potential paddler to undertake the trips described with confidence and in safety. I am familiar with many of the rivers described in this book in north Florida and have noted several gross inaccuracies. The most dramatic being the description of a Blackwater River trip of more than thirty river miles being accomplished in four hours! This could certainly lead a novice paddler into considerable difficulty were they to try the same trip. Taken as entertaining prose and accepting the ""poetic license"" taken with some important details, I found the book otherwise to be enjoyable reading, written by folks who certainly do enjoy the sport. As a starting point in looking for a new river to cruise Carefree Canoeing is a fun and useful read, but accurate and complete sources must be consulted before planning a trip to any of the rivers described."
5,The Greatest Show Ever Bar None!!,"Cheers is the best show ever!! I bought the First Season the day it came out, and I'll buy the Second Season the day it comes out.The writing is brilliant, the acting is the best that's ever been on TV. The First and Second Season are the the best seasons ever!! Along with the 3rd, 4th, 5th etc. The whole show is great and there is not one thing wrong with it. Anybody who is anybody will own this, along with the First Season, and every other season that comes out. I have alot of respect for this show. So join Sam, Cliff, Coach, Carla, Norm, and Diane, in the Second Season of the greatest show ever!!! Pull up a stool, and get ready to laugh with the gang at the Boston bar where everybody knows your name. CHEERS"
4,Cheers to a hit sitcom's second season!,"Here are the episodes that NBC aired from September 1983 to May 1984. The original six cast members return with no newcomers yet. Before the beginning of this season,Shelley Long had already wrapped up filming ""Irreconcilable Differences"" with Ryan O'Neal,a Warner Bros. drama. I'm sure Cheers was at least nominated for more Emmys in 1984. This season is really not different from 1982-83."
5,One of the Best Seasons of Cheers!!,"Greatest show ever bar none. No pun intended. A classic, and a phenominal sitcom, for any decade. Its still hilarious after all these years. Sam and Cliff are my two favorite characters, but I love them all. I love Cheers. My favorite show of all time. So join the cast where everybody knows your name. You'll be glad you came."
2,Dreadfull,"I own the first season which is great! I have also seen just about every other episode ever, although I must have missed these on tv and I can see why... they didn't want to air them. The majority of this season is just Sam and Diane fighting and making up, fighting and making up, having sex and fighting. There are not enough coach, Cliff, and Norm moments. This season was for sure the black sheep of the series. I do however highly recommend the series as a whole... one of the top 3 best shows ever created!"
5,Classic TV,"This is just Classic Cheers, nicely packaged in a four disc set. The price was lower than I found the same item at Big Box stores."
5,great product,"my three year old loves her new fisher price ""ipod"". She loves the pink color and can choose her favorite songs by the icon pictures(a great feature). My only complaint is that the volume at its highest level is still very low which makes it difficult for her to hear while riding in the car on the interstate while traveling."
1,Skip this purchase,"My daughter got this as a xmas gift. Biggest pain in the butt toy she's ever received. When it works she loves it. It took me almost an entire day to get the stupid thing to connect, ended up using my parents computer. Whenever you replace the batteries the thing resets and you have to plug it back into the computer to get it to put your songs on it, the pre-programed songs are pretty awful. If you buy this as a gift I would recommend setting it up for the kid first, unless you hate their parents and want to punish them."
4,Too Expensive,I bought this item for my daughter almost 4 years ago. We loved it an it worked great. We bought it for about $59.00. It finally stopped playing and we cannot get it to work. I came on here to try and find a new one since the fp3 player seems to be dicontinued just to find that people want to sell it for about $200! That is absolutely ridiculous. I guess I have to find a different music player for my children.
2,"Good idea, but needs some improvements","I got this for my 3-year-old for her birthday, and she really loves it. It's easy to use and figure out--it took her almost no time to know what the buttons did. Putting music on was easy because we just used the CDs she already had. The two major flaws with it are:1. It EATS batteries like crazy!! It takes four AA batteries, and within just a few hours they were dead.2. There is no way to find a track on the system other than hitting the forward button until you find the song you're looking for. For a 3-year-old who keeps insisting on hearing a specific song, it's very frustrating. Also, when you turn on it returns to the beginning of the list of songs so you have to scroll through again.It's a great idea for kids, but it would be much better if they had a rechargable battery and a way to scroll through the songs to select the one you want."
4,My Daughter Loves It,"I think that it is great. My only problem is that it cannot read advanced CDs (CDs with DVD or CD-Rom) and unfortunately, almost all of Disneys CDs are like this so there is a whole lot of childrens music this excludes."
2,Doesn't Run on VISTA,"This product doesn't run on VISTA Operating System. FP's customer service was nice but I wish this was mentioned during download, online at the FP web site or on the box. My daughter loves her 'kid iPod' but is disappointed that her favorite songs aren't included."
2,Buyer Beware customer service lacks alot!,"My daughter received this player as a gift for her birthday and she loves it HOWEVER, I spent over 3 hours with 4 different customer service reps from Fisher-Price in one day alone trying to trouble shoot software installation problems. The story changed with each person I spoke with. As per their request I unistalled the software numerous times and have now used up my 5 installs of the software! So...when I get a new computer I will no longer be able to load any songs and therefore be unable to use the player. Think long and hard before purchasing this player. In the long run for the money you will spend you will be better off buying a real MP3 player and NOT the fp3. The player also after only one day of use is marked up."
2,good idea but very complicated,"A very good idea, but a complete pain to load songs on to. I bought two and the first took so long to do that a year later I still have not attempted the other one."
3,"My child loves it, but my hubby wanted to throw it out the window!","Let me start by saying that my 3 year old loves her FP3 player. However, my husband wanted to chunk it out the window when he was trying to download music. We went to the FP website and bought 3 different albums to download. Everytime he tried to download the files to the FP3 player, he got an error message. Thinking that there was something wrong with the FP3 player, we exchanged it for a new one. But still, we had the same problem. Then we saw the review by ""jamie009""...all I can say is THANK YOU for your review! The suggestion to delete the 3 files that pop up when you plug the device into your computer worked and we were suddenly able to download music. We even downloaded some of my daugher's favorite songs that she hears on the radio! Why it has to be so difficult, I don't know. FP definitely needs to work on this! Overall, I am glad it all worked out, because my daughter loves the toy!"
3,Not bad - not that great,"The unit has taken a fairly high degree of impacts - and no issues there. Music sound is clear - and the limit on the volume is great. The issues I have is that songs must be converted to a new format, which can take time - and the idea of Icons for songs is great - but highly limited. My daughter is just begining to understand the labels, but with limited options - they are not logical. Also - I cannot catagorize the music - so you may want to only load a small number of songs - as you have to scroll through them."
3,Kid Tough???,"My daughter just received this item for Christmas- a few days early and already the headphones are broken. The pads that are on the headphones came off, and WILL NOT stay on. Without the pads, the headphones are very hard. I am pleased with the overall function of the product, but how can this be kid tough if they break within the first hour??"
2,Not worth it!!,"Don't bother. I bought this for my daughters 4th b-day (today). Now I don't have a gift to give her. I was going to load some songs for her when she opened it, loaded the software fine, computer recongnizes the player, but their own software doesnt recognize it!! DUH! After 1.5 hours of loading and reloading, boohing and reboothing I am done. It should not be this hard. I appreciate that others had the patience to spend 2 weeks waiting for replacement software and hours on the phone with cusotmer service but I do not, I have a party to get ready for. Just no gift to give. :-("
1,It doesn't work with windows vista,I bought this toy for my daughter. It's very durable and easy to use. We swithed to Windows Vista and it no longer works. I called and there is no fix coming any time soon. I purchased my daughter another player.
5,Great Toy My Girls LOVE It!!,"I bought this for my five year old and she LOVES it! She has four older siblings, all with ipods, and she wanted her own ""ipod"" so this was a great solution. It is very durable, easy to use and everyone I have recommended this to has been pleased! The only downsides are that I have not been able to find replacement headphones and there is no belt clip so it has to be held. She LISTENS to it all the time!!"
3,Fixing problem with not writing to device,"This is a solution to all the others that cannot write new songs to the device. it looks like when some of these devices were manufactured, all of the files were set with the Read only bit set on all of the files.When a song is written to the device, it adds the track, then it will update either the playlist.sng (songs) or playlist.sty (story). If these files are set to read only, then they can not update the internal playlist and the player will not know about any new tracks, and you will get the write access error.Short story to get it working with XP, Vista or whatever - When you connect it to you machine and the drive pops up; right click playlist.sng and then choose properties. Uncheck the attribute for Read only. Then do the same for playlist.sty. It should work fine for everything, and the access errors will disappear.I hope this helps some people out.PS. I was called in to resolve this problem because parents of the device could not get it working"
1,"Does not play MP3, only proprietary fisher price format","The actual player itself seems to be quite usable for my four year old.However, for the parent the software is crap. Here is why:1. It only runs on windows. If you have mac, linux, freebsd you are out of luck.2. The player only plays fisher price proprietary format music files. So sorryall those MP3 files you have spent years ripping from your CDs will not work.Time to re rip them into FP3 format, that is if you can still read the CDs.This is yet another example of anti-consumer lock in products that areunfortunately becoming more common."
4,Technology and Children,"I got the FP3 player for my 5 year old granddaughter because I didn't want her to be left out of being able to listen to music (her sister got an Ipod Shuffle). She loves it! The headset is perfect for her, the controls are easy for her to manage and understand. She can listen to the same music as her big sister (age 10). Technology isn't only for preteens or teenagers. Kids are smarter these days and are exposed to more technology than ever. They see their parents, siblings, and grandparents using computers, mobile phones, Ipods, and video games. They like the cool stuff too! They shouldn't be left out. I only have one suggestion. Place a clip on the back of the FP3 player for kids to clip on to their clothing instead of hanging around their neck. It gets in the way when they are dancing because it flops around!"
2,Obscure in self indulgence,"Less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition, this book more aptly excerpts the author's personal conflicts with human relationships.....a one-on-one wrestling match with the Self with no spectators and no judges. The book is a good read for academic analysis, but not so fun for venturist philosophy."
5,Opening the Eyes of this Trainer,"This book inspires me to be a better trainer. The definition of insanity is doing what you have always done and expecting different results. O'Driscoll asserts, and I agree, that this is the cycle in which many in this profession, including myself, have been caught. We train and train and train - and with what actual results? O'Driscoll describes a new role for the training function - one that serves a business purpose and works toward the goals of the organization, sometimes training, sometimes assuming a different role. In this new economy in which many training departments are coming under increased scrutiny of purpose, his point is valid and can't be ignored. Anyone managing or working in a training department would be well served to pay attention to this book."
5,A professional trainer's view,"Just as organizations have undergone a transformation, the function of Human Resources and Training must undergo a transformation as well. Tony O'Driscoll has done an excellent job describing where organizations have been, where they are headed and how the Corporate Training Function must evolve to keep up. Through human performance technology and systems thinking applied to HR activities, O'Driscoll illustrates how organizations can evolve into high performance work systems. The book is insightful and thought provoking. A good read."
5,TOTAL VALIDATION!!,"This book is a total validation of the feelings and fears I experienced after the onset of my genetic illness. No one else understood, but JoAnn LeMaistre did, and finding that I was not alone in my experience and learning that there was a process I had to endure made things easier. I was so moved that I found JoAnn and joined one of her support groups! This is a must-read for people newly diagnosed AND their families. An illness never affects just one person - it affects that person's entire family in every aspect of their lives."
1,Well made ... but,"Hi there, this product is well made and that's about all I can say about it. If you want to banish headaches, start eating wholesome foods and learn all you can about what you're eating ... food allergies, etc. I recommend you read anything and everything by Dr. Gillian McKeith, and watch ""You Are What You Eat""."
1,Corny,"We watched this back in the seventh grade after reading ""Summer of the Swans."" I never liked the book either, but the film was awfully corny and changed too much. For an example, Sarah's brother Charlie was mentally-handicapped in the book and unable to speak, but here he is a talkative little boy who chatters away. Not to mention the fact that in the film he is celebrating his FIFTH birthday! In the book Charlie was ten years old. Also, Sarah has the character development of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Really, in one scene she takes one look at her orange sneakers and tells her brother that she likes them, but then two seconds later she literally told her brother she hated them. The plot was fast-paced, too, and the acting wasn't the best. But at least we had some time away from class."
1,Really not all that great......,"Ms. Hawke creates an interesting 'live' vampire here, but he is the only good thing about this book. The author's use of descriptors [spec. colors] with EVERYTHING do not seem that of a professional writer.As for being erotic, well the few love scenes were slightly steamy but nothing to write home about.This is obviously a planned series as there are so many loose strings left at the end its a wonder my book didn't unravel. Read it in one sitting and donated it to the library the next day. Maybe I can save someone from wasting their money on it...."
1,too many loose ends,"Rowan is a so-called witch with a bad itch that needs scratching preferably by Rick. But hey, why stop there? The plot is incomplete. The bad guys aren't really bad guys. The transitions between the scenes are jerky. Characters run from Point A to Point B and back to Point A again. This book is completely pointless and a waste of time. For a good witch story, try Nora Robert's Three Sisters Island Trilogy."
3,"Yeah, I guess it swings ...","... and it sounds a lot like some other jazz that I like a lot, like Jan Garbarek for example, or like Josh Redman in some of his phases. I'm not put off by the violin, although the violin hasn't ever claimed much ""market share"" in jazz. In fact, I picked this CD out of a bargain bin because of the violin, because I'd heard of Jean-Luc Ponty as a violinist. On this CD he doubles -- multi-tracks? -- on synthesizer and really he plays ""second fiddle"" to his very creative pianist Wally Minko. The rest of the band, judging by their names, are all French Africans. Lots of colorful percussion, lots of hypno-minimalist riffs ...... but it's not exciting. It sounds like lounge music, stuff you can generate by the musical meter or kilometer. Where's the soul? Where's the life experience?"
3,Great Photographer - Lousy Edition,"Otto's works speaks for itself, too bad the edition put out by Regan Books was done so poorly. If one always hears about editors ruining a photographer's work, this is the perfect case. Images were blown up carelessly with no resolution - one wonders what was the criteria used.Maybe a book worthwhile to have as to complement a library, but in any case, Otto just put out a brazilian edition of his extraordinary work which is worth looking for."
1,Very bad. A really crap. Don`t waste your money in this,A book full of bad quality pics (low resolution in many cases and very bad composition). Its a collection of like amateur/tourist photos that try to give a very poor view about the eroticism in Rio de Janeiro.Poor result. Seeing photos of a friend that already traveled to Rio its the same experience. Dont waste your time. Its a brazilian talking. Trust in me. : ). There other things much better than this crap.
4,Awesome shoes under $50,"These are almost perfect shoes. All leather, comfortable, fit well, nice out-sole, and right size. I just wish the leather is a little bit thicker."
5,one of my best cd's of 2005,I GOT THIS CD OFF OF FELTON'S WEBSITE AND WOW! WHAT A CD. NOT ONLY THAT BUT I GOT A SIGNED PHOTO OF HIM WITH IT. THE SONGS ARE NICE AND SMOOTH. THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD.
5,Rich and compelling,"Not your usual church music, though Silvan is a church musician. Using sacred poetry from many traditions, Silvan weaves vocal lines and instrumental lines in ways that draw one forward in good pace with the rhythmic patterns of the poetry he has chosen. Neither showy nor catchy, the melodies grow on you and the poetry seeps in. Silvan's compositions demonstrate why Jazz and Classical are cousins, and why good music is the voice of the soul."
5,Intro,"I remember Intro performing at my college homecoming concert my Sophmore year...or was it my freshman yr?lol Anyhow they were as great live as they were on the Cd. the first Intro songs that I heard was Love Thang, & Let me be the one.. but the song that I fell in love or lust..lol with was Come Inside.This song is so sensual and sexy. I love the whole Cd. Their rendition of Stevie Wonders ribbon in the Sky is worth its weight in gold. Its beautifully redone. There are many other songs that I love on this Cd that didn't get much airplay, but they are still gems to me. If you are or ever were a fan of the group Intro please buy this CD asap!You won't be sorry .. .PS Rip Kenny Greene.. you were a GREAT singer..beautiful voice.. but you will live on through your music."
5,KENNY I MISS HIM RIP,"LET ME START BY,SAYING I HAD THE BIGGEST CRUSH ON KENNY GREENE THE SONG COME INSIDE CAME OUT WHEN I WAS A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS SO SAD TO HEAR OF HIS PASSING I WAS TRULY IN LOVE WITH THIIS MAN AND I AM A FEMALE NO MATTER WHAT HISIFESTYLE WAS HE SUNG WITH SUCH PASSION, WE WILL MEET IN THE NEXT LIFE AND HE WILL BE MY HUSBAND INTRO WAS THE GREASTEST NINETYS GROUP I LOVE YOU KENNY GREENE RIP ALL YOUR FANS STILL MISS YOU!!!!"
5,Beautiful!,"I love this album! The remake of Stevie Wonders' ""Ribbon In The Sky"" has now become a must for all urban/ethnic weddings. The seductive ""Come Inside"" screams love-making at it's best. Those are the two songs that stand out on the whole album. As another reader had mentioned before, Kenny Greene {as of this writing} died of AIDS complications. He was the lead singer for this incredible group. In the latest issue from S2S magazine, there is a tribute to Kenny as well as a interview with his road manager? or someone close to him {the nature of the friendship seems to evade me} and there is/was a third Intro album done or in the works to be released. Heaven forbid for some reason the album is not released, PLEASE go get this album. You'd be glad that you did. Get it for the pleasure of listening to good R&B or as a tribute to Kenny. Either way, you cannot go wrong. RIP Kenny. You will never be forgotten."
2,Not my flavor,This CD has good sound quality.It hasn't grabbed me though and I have hardly listened to it.Michel is a talented pianist and works with some good traditional jazz musicians.I think it is a chocolate/vanilla thing.This music is chocolate and I'm a vanilla person.I hope you enjoy it.Mike
2,Not for flutists,"I was really disappointed after hearing ""Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun"" on this CD. The opening solo flutist uses a ""nanny-goat"" vibrato that was popular some years ago and is out of tune. The other selections on the CD are OK, but I don't think I can ever listen to ""Faun"" again."
2,50% cotton only,"This one has nice design. But only 50% cotton even though it's soft. Also, the comforter is kind of thin for winter season. When you buy it from BabyAge, be careful with their return policy (50% restocking fee and only store credit issued)."
3,Parts are useful...,We used this bedding set to go with our multi-color design. It went fantastic! The bedding sheet does get faded quickly & the bumpers aren't recommended (due to possible suffocation). The quilt is perfect for floor-time though. A lot of money for a few things that I would rather buy separately.
5,The cutest !!! Very high quality !!!,"When I saw this online, I knew I ""had"" to drive to the store and see it in person. It is absolutely precious!!! I have been looking for four months for the perfect crib comforter, now I found it. We brought it home and now, just have to wait for the baby!"
4,The Complete Story of Temples,"No other volume manages so comprehensive a detailing of the temples of ancient Egypt--their history, lore and design. There are color and black and white photos, maps and floor plans, but most importantly, the text documents the historical development and significance of each site it references.The concise narrative covers the entire system of temple monuments, such as the Temples at Karnak, Luxor, Dendera, Kom Ombo, Edfu, Giza and Abu Simbel. But, this is no tourist guide to temple sites. The casual reader may find the detailed discussion of such subjects as building materials and construction methodologies a bit dry. This is a must-have for the student of Egyptology and the religion and art of the ancient world."
5,"comprehensive, and encyclopedic","Having bought and read the equally comprehensive complete guide to the pyramids, which is another book in this series, I just had to buy this also. I am glad I did. This is another encyclopedic book containing information, photos, histories, site plans, diagrams and anything else you can think of for all the temples in Egypt. In an age when most books give snipets of information on only the best known sites this book and the others in the series are invaluable research and information sources. Having been to Egypt, I would have loved to have had this book available at the time so that I could have visited other sites, that I now know of. Hopefully, I will go back again, and shall bring this superb book with me."
1,Disappointed,"I bought the skil angle finder a few days ago. I checked the digital accuracy at 90 degrees against a precision square and found the readout to be off only a tenth of a degree, certainly within stated specs. of < .5 degrees. The downside is that every time I set the gauge in an application the scale was always positioned upside down. The angle indicator can only be viewed on one side. On the third day of trial the indicator upon startup began flashing even after changing out the battery . A call to the tech department which proved to be prompt and courteous could not provide a fix. Needless to say, I returned the item to my dealer for a refund."
2,Worked for a while,"I bought the angle finder to do metal stairs and railings.I found it hard to open and had to use it upside down most of the time.Yesterday it started blinking 0.0. I changed to a brand new battery and this did not solve the problem.I can do the same work with a string, pocket level and a framing square.A $5.00 magnetic angle indicator is more versatile."
3,just ok...,"The Skil 2100DAF seemed to work as advertised, but the angles it showed and the actual angles in relationship with the wall vs the ceiling on crown molding, which most homes are not perfect, it really makes this tool useless. Getting a real good fit still required taking scrap pieces and playing with the angles in the corners until they fit the way I wanted them...like I said if everything is absolutely perfect, great tool if not I guess it is still a good tool to find a starting point with...Basically, you can do the job without it..."
4,Old School King of Bass,"That's how you could describe Magic Mike. In the 1990's my friend and I would blast him and Bass Patrol riding around town. This record is outdated at this point, but it brings back memories for me. This album has a little extra than just the bass heavy beats. There is actual rhyming going on. I stumbled across this in my collection and had to listen to Down Through the Years and Represent. They not that bad hip hop tracks."
5,Great Deal-All Movies Are Cute,"All of the movies are cute, romantic and funny. None of them are classics, but a great combo, especially for the price."
4,A Good Value,"This 4 pack of dvds, is a very good value. We got many hours of enjoyable entertainment, from these cute movies. Some, of course, we liked better than others, but I'd give this a thumbs up, as 4 packs go. My husband doesn't mind chick flicks, as long as they have a good story, so this was perfect for us."
2,Second Class Films,"The Wedding Date is bad. The characters are unrealistic and not likeable from the start. Immediately made me disinterested.The Story of Us is just a bitter slugfest with no real substance.Intolerable Cruelty has some moments, and I didn't see the other one yet. But if only half of the movies are decent, it's not much of a deal for the money."
5,Great Romantic Movies,"Loved all 4 movies , a great buy for the money , a Must have for a fun evening ...."
2,The story is plain with very little excitement,"After reading Siena Summer by Teresa Crane, I personally would not want read it the second time.The story started with some flair of brilliance and uniqueness. Nonetheless, it did not convey enough plot to grab readers' attention especially during the middle section of the story. It was mostly plain storytelling with very little climax and excitement and the ending was largely expectable.It was a reasonably good love story, but it could have used more and better metaphors to describe certain situations, which, I personally think, are an important part of a love story.The story, though lethargic in some sense, had described an extract of the Italian culture vividly and it was an enjoyable experience to read about another culture with a plot.If you are seeking a brilliant love story, this is not the one to purchase. However, if you are seeking experience of another culture, you have a good book right here.== James =="
1,Arrived broken.,When I received this rear wheel hugger it was broken. I also feel like it wouldnt do well for road use because it was made out of fiberglass.... and the fact it couldnt survive shipping.
3,Good but better books are out there,"I thought the book was pretty good in relating Graham and Dodd concepts to modern investing. The author's writing style doesn't keep the reader's attention for prolonged periods of time. I think there are better books out there, specifically Katsenelson's ""Active Value Investing"""
4,Great singer,"I wish we heard more singers like Marc, one of my fav CDs as a kid was this one, Walk thru the world brings back mamny memories"
2,Disappointing,"I really enjoy Cohen's 1991 release ""Marc Cohen"" so I decided to add this offering to my collection. I do not see this CD getting much ""airplay"" in the future. Oh well, nothing ventured, nothing gained."
1,Nowhere near as good as his first CD,Very disappointed. Not the same emotional melodies or rhythms as on his amazing first CD 'Marc Cohn'.
2,Marc Cohn Focuses on the World thru the eyes of Las Vegas,Well this cd is not about a rainydude no matter what you might believe. His style is better when he is focused on the small town situations and he can get lost in the shuffle in the 'real world' quote unquote.
5,Deserves more recognition,"This album contains a number of tender, moving tracks, done with real artistry and love. Simply beautiful. Admittedly you will not find here the same infectious energy that animated such magical, euphoria inducing hits like ""walking in memphis."" The themes here are more down to earth, more a celebration of what is ""real."" Of his first three albums this is certainly my favorite and I feel lucky that I found out about it."
4,"Maybe not quite as good as his debut, but grossly underrated","I agree with another reviewer that this album went exactly nowhere. It ended up in the cutout bin before you could say $3.99. That seems a shame since there are really great songs here including ""Walk Through the World"", ""The Rainy Season"", ""Paper Walls"", and ""She's Becoming Gold"". I think perhaps a lot of people were not willing to give it a chance when they realized ""Walking in Memphis"" was not here. Make this your second Marc Cohn album and you shouldn't be disappointed."
4,4.5 stars - maybe higher,"Cohn's sophomore effort is something of a neglected jewel - 'Walk Through The World' gained a reasonable amount of radio play, but it failed to make the charts, and the album peaked no higher than #63 in it's four-month chart reign. But you shouldn't judge an album on its chart success (or lack of).Most of the songs here are every bit as strong as those from the debut - particularly the title track, 'Medicine Man' and 'From The Station', but also two of the most deeply personal tracks ever recorded - 'Rest for the Weary' and 'The Things We've Handed Down'. Much of the rest is comparatively lightweight, but still very good.Many people will probably dislike 'Baby King' with it's gospel feel and annoyingly repetitive chorus, but it is the only track here that feels out of place, or, indeed, unwanted.In conclusion then, if you loved Marc Cohn's debut (and why wouldn't you?) you'll like 'The Rainy Season' an awful lot."
2,Shows some promise but not great,"The writer seems new to her craft. She is very weak on plot development. I will purchase others in the series to see if the books improve; however, if the books continue in this vein, I can't recommend them. I like the beginnings of the main character but feel that her haunting by an ex-slave is ridiculous. The ghost is shallow and is bizarrely obsessed with Sarah Booth getting pregnant."
4,If you like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum...,...you'll like Sarah Booth Delaney. She does for Mississippi sleuthing what Stephanie does for New Jersey.A good fun read!
4,Entertaining and engaging.,"Them bones- kept me wanting more. Hard to put down . Interesting characters full of fun, mystery and adventure. Sarah Booth is the Stephanie Plumb of the Delta."
4,A Great and Fun Read,"I really enjoyed this book. Ms. Haines has a wonderful way of blending a great story with ""stimulating"" converstaions with a resident ghost. I found it entertaining, very funny at times, and a page turner. Enjoy"
3,southern names,"The southern names are cloying, too cutesie pie. The plot is OK. The main character seems to be an alcoholic as are most of the females in the book. They eat endlessly and drink anything they can get hold of. Surely southern women are not such airheads."
3,Typos galore,"James Sallis is a careful, thoughtful writer. His words are chiselled out of granite. There is nothing casual about his writing. I have read many of his books, with unfailing pleasure. This particular book is ruined by countless typographical errors, which completely spoil the reader's involvement. On almost every page, you have to stop and try to figure out what the author was trying to say. The early days of Kindle were like this. It is hard to imagine how proofreading standards could get so low."
5,Perfect !,Exactly what I was looking for. Very compact and thin to hold wallet and money plus was a great price.
3,Satisfactory,It was what I wanted but it turned out to be a little larger than I thought it would be.
4,It is what it is...,There's not much to say about a coin pouch. It zips open and closed and holds coins. It is what it is.
4,Good deal,Pouch is great looking and should take care of my husband's change in pocket problem. Had to wait just a bit longer than for most shipped items but had been told that it would be 4-5 days before being shipped. Other than that I am very satisfied.
5,good purchase,This credit card pouch and coin holder is very handy to use. It holds many items and fits easily into my purse. I like it a lot.
5,Great Customer Satisfation,The shoes got to me quickly and with little cost. I was very impressed on the speed and accuracy of my order and I would definitaly order again with no hesitation! Thanks a bunch!
4,Lexmark #32 Ink Cartridge.,Received in good order. As advertised. It would be great if the ink lasted longer.
1,fake product,"the is item is fake,pls dont buy it.better buy the original than this refusrbished.am so disappointed."
1,Cheaper at walmart,Recently discovered you can get the same cartrige at Walmart for 18.82. Not worth the price here especially after you have to pay $5 for shipping.Go to Walmart!
1,Lexmark no. 32 Ink cart,"After clicking 1 click order i found out that this cartridge was not shipped from Amazon [ I was going to order both black and color ]. I immediatly e-mailed the shipper to cancel the order [ inside 1 hour], I received a e-mail in return that the item was already scanned and could not be canceled. I kept the ink cartridge and went to Staples and bought the black cart. The same color cart was available at a cheaper price less than Amazon's private vendor. I probably will not use 1 click shopping again."
1,Lexmark printer ink,"I have received this and unable to use it!!! It said before I bought it that it would work in my printer, but will not. I have tried every way possible to get it to work as I needed it badly and it just says to remove the tape which I did to start with!!!!Can I return this????"
2,A shootie print cartridge,"I'm very dissatisfied was this print cartridge. After installing the cartridge and printing out a test page, and everything I try to print comes out very light and some copies do not print at all. In fact, my printer does not work the same since installing this cartridge. I guess its another case of, you get what you pay for!"
1,Bad ink,"I order this ink in Nov. 24,2009. I need to order again now, because ink was gone. I didn't do too much things on the vacation period."
1,New cartridge lasts for only a month even if you do not use it,This cartridge lasts no longer than a month even if you do not use it!
5,delish!!!,"Love this product, super spicy, can be add to anything, including salsa and chip, divine!!! Fast delivery."
2,A displeasing hot sauce,"For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food. Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches. Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, El Yucateco has set itself apart from the others as being one that I do not care for. It is overpoweringly hot--with a searing heat--and has an odd, unenjoyable flavor. Although not a terrible hot sauce--I consumed the entire bottle--El Yucateco is a hot sauce that I am glad that I tried, but it just is not my thing."
5,divine,"Except for From A Distance, I have never heard Bette Midler. Yesterday, I got the Greatest Hits Songbook. From A Distance is beautiful as an instrumental and vocal. But, Wind Beneath My Wings is reminiscent of Bridge Over Troubled Water. It is beautiful, melancholy and D..ivine. I`m an average piano player. Well,I`m planning to get this Greatest Hits CD and listen to her. And play Wind at the same time on the piano."
2,Mixed....,"Bette Midler is pure talent. However, I only liked maybe 3 songs on this cd. Definitely worth it at a good price."
2,Bette has been better,Thought this was her most famous songs...don't think so. Was disappointed. I only recognized 3 that were hits
5,Bette is Divine!,"This is one of the finest greatest hits CDs by the Divine one herself Bette Midler. It has some of her best songs like ""The Rose,"" ""From A Distance"" and my personal favorite ""Wind Beneath My Wings."" Even the old standard torch song ""One For My Baby (And One More For The More)"" made famous by Frank Sinatra is in there and was used on Johnny Carson's last show on ""The Tonight Show."" ""Experience The Divine"" is one album you should check out and experience for yourself."
5,All the Favorites and More!,"Bette Midler can sing and her voice is well-heard. I don't care much for the Rose but I'll listen to it again if she sang it live like she does at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. She has some her favorites and ours like ""Wind Beneath My Wings,"" ""In My Life,"" ""Hello in There,"" etc. I don't care for her rendition of ""When A Man Loves A Woman"" because it's been done to death but I'll hear it again if it's Bette. She certainly is Bette the Divine, the People's Diva as she crowns herself. Her songs also reflects a variety of War songs from the last World War like the Bugle Boy song and others. To me, Bette's at her best when she sings ballads like ""in my life"" and ""Wind beneath my Wings."" She's a terrific entertainer but with a potty mouth."
4,A GOOD COMPILATION!,"A wonderful and unique artist and a true star; this collection shows off Bette Midler's talents. Personally I miss ""Beast ofburden"" from her ""No Frills""-album. The song was quite a hitin Europe. It's about time for a volume 2 of this lady'sgreatest -she has recorded several great songs since thiscompilation came out."
5,Combine time management with marketing.,"Ruth Klein makes you ask yourself, what's so important that's keeping you from marketing yourself and your business? If you answer lack of time, this book links them up to show you how one works with the other. It's a good marriage of topics. I bet the most talented personal marketers you know do it without even trying... now you can be one of them."
4,"Wonderfully played, some technical issues","Wonderful performances of this stunning music. Some editing mistakes become annoying after repeated listening (and this record is worth repeated listening). For instance track 12 on disc 2 suddenly becomes several dB softer halfway, and in some other tracks, the editing causes some unnatural tempo shifts. Otherwise warmly recommended."
2,---- curious.....,"---i love his chopin....but hearing scarlatti played like it was chopin just didn't seem right.....very loud then very soft...wicked fast....then decel, strange and exaggerated pauses...giant crescendos with the pedal...lots of pedal...oye!---still it was unique and...... inexpensive."
5,Drama at the keyboard,"I've listened to both CDs all the way through twice and haven't stopped admiring the fresheness, clarity and drama of the playing and the music. These are all played on a modern piano, with careful touch and some pianistic moments that a harpsichord purist might not like. But the spirit of the music comes through without ostentation. The recording is first rate. I've compared it with my Horowitz Scarlatti and it stands up well with a better piano sound, more sonatas (2 CDs), and very nice playing. Nothing will compare with the Old Master, however, for sheer brilliance."
3,"Brilliant technique, but too emotional playing","These sonatas are played by Mr. Pletnev more like if they were Schuman than Scarlatti. I have nothing against romantic music, in fact I like it very much, but Scarlatti is not romantic, and due to the over-romanticism or over-emotionalism of the playing, the music sounds as if it has nothing to say.The Horowitz recordings of these works are much much better.I agree, however, that the sound and technical ability are superb, so I give it three stars and not less."
2,Overdone,"Pletnev's pianism is certainly impressive, but his obsession with contrasting textures frequently goes perversely against the natural grain of the music, rendering each sonata a schizophrenic patchwork. This music is so much more convincing heard on a good harpsichord -- try Leonhardt's 14 Sonatas instead."
2,Not a bad price....,"If you're looking for perfection, keep looking. Technically shoddy to the point of distraction. However, for $3/CD, it will make a good gift for your mother-in-law."
5,Not Since Gould,"Some of us old folks remember the first release of Gould's ""Goldberg Variations"" in 1957. This recording should, in my opinion, be of equal impact on the world of classical pianism. It is, quite simply, astounding!Basta! Genug! Assez! Enough! Just listen."
3,a completely insane bargain,"It is a monumental piece of insanity that these two discs of wonderful music are being sold for less than the cost of one normal CD. Not that I'm complaining.Mikhail Pletnev is a modern master. As far as I'm concerned, he is the most talented pianist alive (all apologies to Jacqueline Schwab and Marc-Andre Hamelin). This recording is by no means his best; but how can you not love it?Pletnev always seems to get inside the soul of a composer. He finds things long hidden and reveals (though some might accuse him of creating) them. He continues this magical feet on these discs.While some have complained of Pletnev's romantic/modern reading of Scarlatti, I say why complain when someone brings all-too tired music back to life? Pletnev's Scarlatti is incredibly refreshing and endearing. I dare you not to like this music.I give this recording a hearty recommendation."
5,First time I ever truly heard Scarlatti,"This is Scarlatti played on a modern instrument in a romantic style. It sounds to me like Beethoven or Chopin. It reminded me of Busoni's version of Bach.I never truly heard Scarlatti before I listened to this version, never enjoyed Scarlatti much at all, but this version sent thrills through me. I am grateful to Pletnev for making it possible for me to hear Scarlatti."
5,Worth every word,"This novel should be read by more people. It was a great work of historical fiction that made my heart smile for the Africans working/fighting for freedom during the Civil War. Based on true events, this novel should make all Americans proud."
1,warning concerning wines' download,"For those thinking about purchasing the kindle version of E. C. Wines' THE LAWS OF THE ANCIENT HEBREWS, BEWARE! This book is a classic and worth having in your kindle library. However, the kindle version of the text is so small one cannot read it even if you use the zoom mechanism. A problem exists, and until it is corrected, it should not be purchased. Also, it is indicated that the text can be listened to, but this is inaccurate since when attempting to do so, the message indicates it is not possible. This is a great book, but needs to be corrected before it is put on sale.John Saggio, 6/14/2011"
3,MURDER IN THE ROUGH,"Did anyone else notice that the authour intermittently started calling Uncle Fergus, Uncle Felix about three quarters of the way through the book????? Sort of a mystery within a mystery???"
4,Borthwick's Murder in the Rough,"I have enjoyed all of Borthwick's books since I ran across the first one shortly after its publication. And this latest one is an enjoyable read as we follow Sarah's good and evil twin journey. HOWEVER, this has to be one of the most slovenly-edited books I've ever read. Not only are there typos which a spellchecker couldn't possibly get (vice for voice)so some human intervention is needed, but Uncle Fergus occasionally becomes Uncle Felix. Not what one expects from a respectable publishing house! I do hope enough people complain that they haul up their socks and get down to business!"
3,wharfdale at 400 speakers,"I have had my wharfedale AT400 speakers for four days now and I'm still waiting for them to shine. Not that I'm disappointed with the speaker, but I did expect a little more bass than they were able to produce. I was going to go without a sub-woofer, but found that I had to purchase one anyway to help reach those deep bass sounds I expect from my surround sound system. I have an onkyo receiver and these speakers handle the power well and sound great at high volumes. The mid range is a little muddy which gives the speaker a somewhat smooth sound that would please the jazz lovers in the crowd. I would recommend these speakers for any one who wants decent sounding speakers for a good price."
1,Good movie if your 12 and got a crush,"I sometimes wonder why half-decent actors stoop to making an appearance in low-budget movies of any description.I tried to give this a chance but the performances are completely wooden, the plot predictable in the extreme and the sets look like they could fall down anys econd, they are so false.Complete waste of time and even my wife agreed!"
1,"The DVD is a Copy, not an Original","I received the movie in a very timely manner, but it is a copy and not an original. The print quality of the paper in the case is poor and even cut off. The DVD has a copy of a label too and is creased and trashed. The movie plays. I just feel ripped off."
1,Awful. Don't waste your time.,"Do you ever get a movie, put it in the dvd player, hit play and five minutes into it just know it's going to be awful? Then you try to convince yourself that it will get better, it just has to, right? And then at the end of the movie kick yourself for wasting your time on a truly lousy movie.That about sums up my experience watching Letters to Juliet. The acting was terrible, the characters one dimensional, and the plot silly. A truly awful movie."
1,this movie makes me want to move to hollywood...,... and help them create a movie that isn't insulting to watch. I'm not asking for Sleepless in Seattle- just something that isn't this shallow and predictable.
3,Cheesy,"This movie was cheesy and predictable. Of course, the actresses were very good,but the actor who played Charlie was not at all likeable and there was no chemestry between Charlie and Sophie. I wish I had rented something else."
5,Love this movie,I love the story of Romeo and Juliet. This is a great story based on the idea of Romeo and Juliet. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes romantic movies. It had me almost crying in the end.Plus the location shots are wonderful
3,Tepid romance masks real life,"This is a rather tepid romance centered on an aging Brit (Vanessa Redgrave) searching for her first love from 1957. The other romantic angle involves the young American (Amanda Seyfried) who travels to Verona with her hubby to be on a pre-honeymoon vacation (must be nice). Sophie (Seyfried) draws Claire (Redgrave) to Italy by answering a letter she finds stuffed in a brick wall. Claire brings along her grandson who's a bit short on politeness, but is a looker. No surprise as to how this all turns out of course. The PG rating gives away the chaste elements of the romance. On the plus side, the Italian countryside looks terrific and it's nice to see Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero (Lorenzo her long lost love) hook up again 43 years after ""Camelot"". Perhaps there is the real plot."
4,Nice Romance Movie,"I really enjoyed Letters to Juliet. The roles are cast well &, although the storyline is mostly predictable, it is still an enjoyable story to watch unfold. The Italian backdrop of the movie is beautiful & definitely adds to the movie. I would recommend watching it."
5,lovely movie,the scenery and story are just lovely. franco nero and vanessa redgrave gave a touching performance. i saw it twice
4,Love to be in love,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Amanda has a very pretty and expressive face... which made it easy to stay through the movie. It was charming to watch her as she found love first for someone else and then discover it for herself. Being a hopeless romantic, I enjoyed the back n forth between Amanda and her love interest in the movie. I found the Engligh wit and humor in the movie quite appealing. The movie beautifully showed the magic of warm and romantic Italy. Recommend to watch for die-hard romance fans like me and a big no-no for I-can't-stand-mushy-love-movies people like my hubby. Hope you enjoy the movie too!"
5,Great Movie,I love this movie! I accidentally had this movie shipped to my parent's house so I had to wait to pick it up when I had time. The best part is my mom opened my package and watched the movie instead of sending it to me! We both love this movie!
4,Nice movie but wish it was not a single disk,"I found this movie refreshing to heart and helpful in a personal situation, I found really no problem with content of movie. Audio sounded nice on my new Denon 791 system.My main reason for this is concern for Signal format Blu-ray/DVD. I love having extra DVD in package for systems that don't have Blu-ray - but if I have a choice between a single Blu-ray disk and Blu-ray/DVD combo I would pick the Blu-ray only.The primary reason is that you have recordable material on both sides and this has more chance of making it dirty. This is not a complaint about the movie itself - but the actual format of the disk that was distributed."
5,a light-hearted romance,"Watched this 3 times on cable TV within a week..ordered it on Amazon and have watched it 3 more times! It's a happy, touching story with a feel good ending that can bring a few tears if you are the type to be ""touched"" by this type movie. Loved the locations and the actors in their roles."
4,Great!,This was a good dvd!! It kept you wondering if the older couple would ever find each other.Wished the young couple hadn't been staying together befor their marriage.
2,"No, no, no","Don't waste your time. Wooden performance by the female lead, terrible dialogue, totally predictable and if it weren't for the lovely Italian setting this movie would get one star. Ridiculous on every level. I can't believe Vanessa Redgrave is in it; she must have had a rent payment due. I thought this was a normal romantic comedy; it's just a formulaic teen movie. Terribly sappy music. Watch Gidget Goes to Rome for more vitality or interest."
1,Could it be worse? Could it be more awfully dumb?,YUKPUKEGAG MEWhat a total waste of time.The only actor who was at least real and natural was Victor.Claire was nauseatingly sweet and smiley.Sofie and Charlie knew each other for how many days? 3? And for 2.5 of those they don't even like each other? And then they fall deeply madly and passionately in love.How UN-romantic and STUPID is that?What kind of a girl wears a skimpy outfit and lies down in the grass beside a boy she doesn't hardly know...and then kisses him...when she is engaged. And doesn't even seem to feel bad about it.Sofie breaks up with Victor in his restaurant in the middle of the day in front of others?I didn't like her character at all. She didn't appreciate Italy either. Whenever they drove anywhere she didn't look out the window once.I could go on and on.
1,read the 1 star reviews....,all true. especially the one by G. Teslovich . great list of why this movie is a total waste of time.apart from Vanessa Redgrave the acting was horrifyingly bad.a movie nightmare.
2,Missed potential,"Solid idea for a movie and definitely a nice way to spend 2 hours. Scenery is just OK for what Tuscany can offer....Verona shines but why film south of Siena in an off season? As for the storyline, both love stories fail completely. I was really kind because I love movies set in Italy to give it 2 stars. They should have taken the 90 minutes to make one love story shine or extended the movie 30 minutes to create 2 interesting love stories. I have no idea why the older couple were together other than a long time ago, they took long walks together. As for the younger couple, they completely fell flat. Their love, apparently, is based on the fact that they have loss in common and that is it. Hollywood was given a great idea set in a perfect county and really messed it up royally...go figure!"
1,So Cheesy!,"I normally enjoy a good chick flick or ""feel good"" movie, but this was over the top. The acting was horrible, except for Vanessa Redgrave. There was no chemistry between the actors. The costuming was unflattering and nothing but a sea of khaki. The soundtrack was obnoxious. We actually laughed at the end. The only reason one might watch this film is to gaze at the lovely Italian scenery. But, PS the whole part about the secretaries to Juliette is fabricated and if you visit her balcony in Verona, there are not crowds of crying women. Instead, there are throngs of tourists lining up to touch Juliette's breast for good luck in love."
1,Unbelievable - bad,"What girl would go to Italy on her pre honeymoon, not see her fiance most of the time, not tour the sights, go places with a man she just met, and want to sit with strangers answering letters? Sounds like a great vacation to me and love story. Sat through one hour of this, what a waste."
4,Very sweet and solid,"As a woman, I admit it, I like the occasional weepy chick flick, romance-comedy, what have you.I was surprised by this movie; it wasn't vapid or insipid as I had feared it would be, but rather sweet. Redgrave is fantastic, churning out a touching performance. Seyfried was a good choice for the writer; I'm unfamiliar with her acting work, so can't comment further. My only two complaints were that the actor playing the grandson seemed like he was trying for Heath Ledger-esque - not bad but not lacking originality and the the actor portraying the restaurateur fiancee overemoted his excitement a bit too much, in my opinion. Both men are talented, no doubt - it will be interesting to see their other theatrical endeavors.I couldn't get my husband to sit through more than 30 minutes of this, so I have no male opinion to share. I can't complain about the movie; I found it enjoyable and the scenery was a pleasure to look at."
3,"A ""nice"" little ""chic"" flick!","After viewing the ads on TV, I looked forward to this film being released on DVD. While it was a nice little film, it just didn't make the grade for me. A lovely tour through Italy, a cute on-going argument between the two young actors and a good performance by the wonderful Vanessa Redgrave. But somehow it struck me as a really bad editing job as there were just too many places that you couldn't connect the dots. A real shame because it could have been really good."
3,Long-lost love and cardboard characters,"Cute film, but the most it's got going for it is fabulous Italian scenery and good-looking actors (both young and not so young!). The characters are cardboard, the kind that only Shakespeare could get away with...for a more satisfying romp in Italy with a Shakespearean theme, I prefer Kenneth Branagh's 1993 interpretation of Much Ado About Nothing."
4,Letter to Juliett - Amazon,"Thank you for the prompt receipt. I had seen the movie on cable and fell in love with it. I wanted one for my personal library so I ordered two copies...one for me and one for a friends birthday gift. Again, thank you."
5,Letters to Juliet,The movie got to me in time and was in good shape. I like having the movie so I can watch any time I want.
5,Surprise surprise,"I love this movie also the fiancé that is the ice king business ,business . Ignores her and she is a romantic..to help someone to find LOVE a the best thing that could happen to her.. Surprise at the end.."
5,Modern Romeo & Juliet,"...Sort of. A wonderful story! So romantic and beautiful. Put your sticky, sweet, syrupy meters away. I'll save you the trouble, you may become diabetic from viewing this one. But SO worth it! I saw this on TV before buying it and I have no regrets. I LOVE Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia fame). I don't recall a thing she's done I did not at least like. Basically this is the story of a fact checker named Sophie (Seyfried) who longs to be a writer and her pseudo-honeymoon with her fiance (Gael Garcia Bernal) to Venice, Italy. But when her Chef boy is too preoccupied with foods, cooking and such she meets the secretaries of Juliet which leads her off on a romantic trip to find a 50 the year lost love of Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) with her not so romantic grandson, Charlie (Christopher Egan). Discoveries lie waiting for all in this treasure."
5,Great Feel Good Movie!,"This is a wonderful movie! My mother and I watched this for ""mother/daughter"" night. We both thoroughly enjoyed it! It's a great feel good movie! Highly recommend."
5,AMAZINGLY AWESOME!!,This movie is one that I will always love! I'm so glad that I spent the money on it!
1,didn't like it. broken dvd,The dvd skips. It also has allot of starches on the dvd. All and all disappointed in the item I received.
2,blah,Cute scenery but that's all.....forced conversations.....cute at times but doesn't feel real like I like movies to feel. The couple interaction was funny couple times but that's all. Not a keeper.
2,Blu-Ray? Not so good..,"While we enjoyed the movie, we were disappointed in the blu-ray transfer. We have dozens of blu-ray discs but this is probably the poorest looking of the lot.Since it is a dual disc, I flipped it to the dvd side and there is little or no difference between the two..."
3,Chick Flick,"I saw this movie with my Mom and sister-in-law. They loved it. I didn't hate it, but it was quite forgettable, other than for the always-commanding presence of Vanessa Redgrave. I hate to sound like a Neanderthal, but if you're a female, you'll probably like it."
3,Yet another chick flick,This is yet another chick flick. And I can normally set that aside and point out more positives than negatives but in this case it's mostly negative. I thought the acting was terrible overall. But more importantly there was no chemistry between the actors and that caused a disconnect between me and them and ultimately the movie. The storyline was very predicable and lacked depth. One positive note - the scenes and landscapes of Italy were beautiful.
5,Cute movie,"Cute movie watched as soon as it downloaded, nice way to spend some comfort time, nice story line, enjoyed it."
4,Cheesy ending but I still loved the movie,"Loved this movie, the scenery was amazing - my hubby & I want to go to Italy now!Sigh! Had to take 1* off due to the lame ending. Why oh why do writers always have to make cringe-worthy endings for romantic comedies? Why did Sophie had to be crying on the balcony? I think it would have been better if Sophie said, ""I did not run away, I had to go to the watercloset which surprisingly has a balcony attached."" And no tears! I really cringe when heroines are crying while confessing their love to the hero...oh please! It's ok to blurt out your feelings to the guy, but don't be a watering can, otherwise he can't look deep into your eyes as he's staring in aghast at your ruined eye make-up dripping ugly streaks down your face.Otherwise, fantastic romantic comedy. It's a keeper!"
4,A pleasant surprize,"Yes, it's a chick flick - but their doesn't seem to be many good showings lately"
4,"Sweet, Romantic Film","Normally, I really dislike most romance films, because they tend to be really poorly made, and they are made for people a lot younger than I am, a middle-aged man who is probably a little too cynical these days. However, I give a whole-hearted big recommendation of ""Letters to Juliet"", which was a sweet, adorable, romance (not romantic comedy, thank goodness).The two lead characters who eventually fall in love (I hope I'm not giving away anything here) are winning and likeable, and the performance of Vanessa Redgrave is quite rewarding. The movie is pretty much one hundred percent predictable, but I found that was a huge part of its charm - you know everybody is going to live happily ever after. I found the movie to be charming and the proper antidote to cynicism. Yes Virginia, there is such a thing as true love."
4,Love story.,If you are into True love and romance then this is the movie for you. I thought it was slow in some parts but it was good all around.
3,Not one of her best,"I really like Amanda Seyfried, but this wasn't one of her best movies. It is a good movie and Helen Mirren is always good to watch."
4,"I am happy with ""happy"".","I went to this picture with my mom because I enjoy romantic films and adore Italian landscape. I was pleasantly surprised. The cast was absolutely charming, and I didn't come away with that ""why did they have to put that in there"" feeling. A true ""feel good"" movie. So many films go along nicely then suddenly BAM! an unexpected horribly sad plot twist. This gets worse than old at times. I'm a big Austen fan, and although she wrote with unexpected plot twists she always ends with a happy, if predictable, ending. And how do ""her"" film adaptations do?! Awesome! Let's hope hollywood learns something here. I hated to see the film end, and could have turned right around and watched it again. Way to Go! Some great young stars shine in this film. Hope to see them around again."
4,Sweet Enough to Overcome the Negatives and the Scenery is Gorgeous.,"Sweet, simple and silly. If that's what you are looking for, then you should like Letters to Juliet. A couple of girlfriends and I enjoyed an afternoon in a cool theater on a hot day. The Italian countryside washed over us and that alone was worth the price of admission. Gorgeous scenery. The story is sweet as well. Romantics will love the lost letter and the search for love fifty years after it is written, and the adventures on the way. Skeptics may struggle with the moments of lightness and silliness that cross over into cheesy a time or two. I really struggled with liking either of the love interests for Sophie.However, like I said, it was a fun outing full of gorgeous Italian countryside with enough romance to make most girls swoon, so it's definitely worth a rent."
2,insipid by any other name,"This goes counter-current here, but this film struck me as an utterly boring and unoriginal romantic search. Not only is it emotionally unconvincing, but you know exactly what is going to happen when she meets the boy. Ambitious girl. Engaged. Trip. Connects. Searches. New boy. Amazing discovery. Sells story. Back to old life. Realizes mistake. New love.The only thing a bit fun in this is that the love whom Redgrave is seeking is in fact the Lancelot she met on the film set of Camelot. Aside from that, you can pass this one up and not know the difference."
4,Try Bernstein's other seventh with the New York Philharmonic,"I just realized something. This version of the Seventh, coupled with the First, is actually from 1958 (very early in Bernstein's career with the NYPO). While it is not a bad performance by any means, I encourage you to buy Bernstein's other performance of the Seventh with the NYPO, recorded in 1964. This later version is much better in my opinion. I would suspect the first reviewer's overly enthusiastic review is actually for this later version. This later 1964 version is also available in the ""Bernstein Century"" collection, paired with the Second symphony."
5,Love It!,"Here are my likes:-From the first moment I put this on my back felt a lot better!-The girls are really ""UP THERE"", may take a little getting used to since they haven't been there in a while.-Not restrictive,binding or pinching. Some side to side movements are out but that is the way all long lines or corsets are made.-Not itchy.-Spectacular Amazon shipping!Here are my criticisms:-The cups are a little outdated in style-Marilyn Monroe-ish and pointy, oh well, there are worse things to look like.-Back closures require a second person to help you.If you live alone, you would want a front closure."
4,Not bad for the price,"You do get your moneys worth out of this amp with features and so on. The plus 20db gain switch works very well and the high/low impedance switch is a very good feature, adding gain to ribbon and dynamic mics. However The high pass filter really does very little and the limiter is weak. The overall sound quality is not bad, I think it could be improved with a better tube, which I am going to install sometime soon. Just a notch down from being a professional sounding amp, but for $59.00, what do you expect?"
5,Great Pre for the Price,"This preamp is really a great value. Is it of a professional studio quality? No. But it produces very clean, noise free amplification and a level line out to plug into either a computers soundcard or an audio interface. The tube aspect of the pre is subtle but it's there. There are better solid state pres on the market but I can assure you that this pre is better than your onboard pre on either your interface or mixer. You'll notice an improvement over the warmth and smoothness of the tone you produce. I use this pre for both dynamic mics (SM57) and condensers (Golden Age Project FC1 Mk.ii)"
1,Noisy! Avoid this one.,"Avoid this preamp. I've tried different configurations with it, and each time it just acts as a noise injector. I get a significantly quieter signal if I hook my mic directly to the mixer channel input and turn the mixer preamp control up near max.Changing input and output connections, phase settings, input/output settings, etc, does not remove the noise.Spend the money on a high-end tube preamp if you need one."
2,Not the only book you'll need,"This book is more of a presentation on what Microsoft FrontPage 2003 CAN do and less of a helpful book about HOW to use FrontPage. It's touted as the ""the only FrontPage 2003 book you need"" but a beginner like me would be better served by buying a step-by-step instruction book."
3,Good reference,"Much information but hard to follow. Sends you to another page for details on a subject, then that page sends you to another (or, in at least 2 cases, sends you back to the original page."
3,This book is not for your Beginner user and it's not a book you can go step by step and learn,"This book is okay. I have read and used other books by this publisher and have found them to be more useful. This book definitely has its uses, such as the chapter on layering and FrontPage's add-in components. However, to take advantage of this book you should use this book as a reference guide and learn FrontPage using another more step-by-step approach kind of book. This book is written for people who already have some experience not like novice users."
2,Returned it,I know my way around front page. I bought this book so that I could learn more. I found that it offered me nothing but hundreds of pages of text that really did nothing for someone like me who wanted to create a visully stimulating website.I guess if you wanted to run a database or just wanted to use a template included in FP than the book would suffice. Anyone looking for ideas for creativity should look else where.I sent it back to Amazon the next day. I am still looking for a book that gives me what I am looking for.
5,"Great addition, but not for beginners.","This is a great book if you know the basics of Frontpage 2003. This is not a beginners book, but an intermediate. Has alot of ways you can improve your site. I am always referring to it."
5,Worth the investment,"I've been using FrontPage for three years but never really appreciated its power until I read this book. The chapters on collaboration are especially helpful if, like me, you have students working on a group project. Highly recommended."
4,BED TIME READING,"If you read this book while in bed, it will put you right to sleep. But if you want a good reference book to assist you with FrontPage, it's great. If it doesn't answer your question it will at least lead you down the right path to get it answered."
3,Broken CD,"The book wasn't as instructive as I had hoped it would be. And the CD, which I understood was more useful, was broken. I now believe that my ordering a soft bound covered book with a CD was a bad idea."
3,Not remastered nor new acoustic songs but great booklet,"I agree with the prior review about the remastering or lack there of. But making the disc louder is not necessarily the point of remastering. Better dynamics and separation is what you should hear. Just increasing the volume (above a certain point) on a CD only causes clipping and compression of the music. It maybe louder but lacks any dynamics.The two acoustics songs are nothing new if you already have the Edel/Concrete re-releases from the 1990s. Either way, this disc has no new or better sounding music.But what a great booklet. It's so thick it barely fits in the digipack. 15 pages of tiny print but well documented information about the band, album and subsequent tour through interviews with the band members. Everything you ever wanted to know about the band and this album during the Edge Of Thorns period. I hope the other re-releases are as good."
5,EDGE OF THORNS!!!!!!!!!,"What an amazing album,Zak Stevens is much better than Jon Oliva, his voice will blow you away. Criss Oliva couldn't done better, this is one of his finest moments, it was a tragedy that he died just after this release. The rest of the band also shows that they were in form. The tracks are all great, my favourite is the title track, which has something that makes me feel sorruonded by a magic forest. Other tunes I love are He carves his stone, Skraggy's tomb, the Follow me trilogy, Degrees of sanity, Conversation piece and All that I bleed. The three last songs are also good, Sleep is a perfect end to this album. Lights out is a bit comercial, but is cool too. So,I recommend this for every person who loves great music, great vocals and a great guitarist, who unfortunatelly died(R.I.P.)"
5,No words could adequately describe this masterpiece!,"Every song here is of very high quality. Great singer, great guitarist, great song writing!If you are a fan of guitar-driven music with powerand melody, you can't miss with this album. Truly amazing!The fact that anyone would put this up for sale as used really perplexes me. But their poor judgment can be your treasure. Don't pass this up! Everyone should own this cd. It should be a prerequisite to citizenship!"
5,Edge of Thorns,"This is one the best albums I have ever heard. It rocks and it brings back memories. The last album before Criss died and probably his best.There is nothing wrong with this album, apart from one line in 'Conversation Piece'.I would recommend this album to anyone inclined to this sort of music and if they don't like it then I can't see why. Everything from the production to the composition is fantatstic and no other Savatage album comes close.Buy it and enjoy."
3,Good but run of the mill ...,"This is good but there are a thousand bands out there exactly like this and some are even better. Still, I don't regret buying it."
2,Disappointing,"After listening to the excellent ""Streets"" and ""The Wake of Magellan"" i found this to be a very poor Cd.It almost definesthe term generic hard rock.There is nothing surprising orinteresting and unlike most people I find Zak Stephensto be a poor mans Sebastien Bach.If you listen to the song ""Believe"" then listen to any song from""Edge Of Thorns"" then you wouldn't believe that it was the sameband who could write such an inspired song then write a collection of songs that are clearly mediocre."
5,BEST SAVATAGE ALBUM WITH THE BEST SAVATAGE SINGER,"Edge of Thorns. Criss Oliva's(R.I.P.)last album. I think it's the best Savatage album ever made.A debut album for the vocalist Zachary Stevens which I believe was the best Savatage singer. In this album Zak shows his skills and capability to replace the Mountain King(Jon Oliva). In these album there are 13 serial killer songs with perfect guitar riffs,anxious melodies,killer drums and with great piano ideas.Top 5 songs:1.Edge of Thorns, 2.Follow me, 3.All that I bleed, 4.Lights out, 5.Miles away(this song's riff makes me shiver because of the feeling of Criss's guitar). A must to all Sava-fans. Zak's departure made me very sadden so I wrote this review as a tribute to Zak Stevens. ZAK RULES..."
3,It depends,"The way you want to utilize this book depends how you read this. I discovered this book while researching a remarkable woman by the name of Anna Eleanor Roosevelt. This book was great at hitting all the major things she has done, but was weak in details. You could use this book in many ways but for basic information on a female would be the best apporach. Don't sit down with this looking for a good read though because all this is is information, unless you like that. So when you research remember this book for basic information on a female."
5,An All Time Favorite,I have a print copy of this book and am excited to also own it on my kindle. I wish it were still in print for gifting! It is a delightful story that captures the meaning of Christmas and exudes love. Madeleine L'Engle is an extraordinary writer. I love all of her books. This one is one of the best!
3,Decent children's book with Christian slant,"This book is not by David Brin at all. I have no idea why it is still listed this way, since it is wholly authored by Madeleine L'Engle.The book is a little heavy-handed in extolling the Christian virtues of the protagonist. However, if you are looking for a gift for a child who anticipating the arrival of a new sibling, this would not be a bad choice."
3,do not dry in the dryer,"A friend of mine reciently bought this product and because of her severe allergies, was told to wash everything included. When she followed the washing instructuions it said to tumble dry on low. Her once beautiful bed set was now brown and crispy! When she took it back the ladies weren't surprised and gave her a word of advice. They told her that this happens quite often and the best thing to do is air dry only! They replaced it but she did have to air dry the comforter, bed ruffel and bumper."
5,I Don't think the Editorial Review is for this Bedding Set!,"I haven't bought this bedding set yet, but the ed. review states that it has pink, yellow & green colors & mushrooms & other insects along w/ the butterflies. It also says the backside of the quilt is gingham? The pics. do not look like that at all, but if the review is corr., please place a review of your own & let me know as that is not what I am looking for! Thanks! M.S."
3,Shrinking Bumper!!!,"I was very happy with this bed set until I had to wash the bumper. The directions state to machine wash warm and tumble dry low, I did that and the end result was a bumper that's 3-4 inches to small! It's not safe to but back in the crib for my daughter. To anyone reading this, I would dry clean to make sure this is not an issue you have too!"
4,"A beautiful set, but had a few quirks.","The first time I saw this crib collection I knew we had to have it. There's so much pink out there that this is an excellent alternative of beautiful baby girl colors. The quilt is just beautiful, although mine is sewn a bit crooked in some sections, and the diaper stacker and valance match so perfectly. The only true disappointment is the fragile bedskirt. I don't know if it was just mine, but the fabic is so sheer that the seam didn't stay together even after the delicate cycle. Overall, this is a darling way to welcome your new baby girl into your home."
4,Beautiful,"I am very happy with how beautiful this set is. The detail of the butterflies is lovely and interesting, and the color scheme is simply gorgeous. The comforter is thick and soft, and the diaper bag is adorable. Another added bonus I wasn't counting on is the design on the bumper has completely mesmerized my 2 month old daughter. She just loves staring at it.One complaint, and what prevented me from giving this a full five stars, is I am less than happy with the quality of the sheet and dust ruffle. The sheet is so thin it is nearly transparent. We can see the design of the mattress through. And the dust ruffle is paper thin as well.I feel that if they made the sheet and dust ruffle in a better quality material this set would have been flawless."
5,beautiful...even after 15 mos of use,"I bought this as a shower gift for my sister-in-law when she and my brother were expecting their first daughter about 15 mos. ago. Not only is it absolutely adorable, it has held up very well. It still looks perfect!I was online looking for bedding for my 2nd niece (due in July) and just happened to read the other reviews on this item again. I thought some might be interested in durability. While I did see one customer who indicated that their bedskirt seemed thin and that it didn't hold up well, this was not the case for the one I purchased.Please note that the editorial review's description is incorrect...there are no mushrooms and NO PINK in this set at all! It is exactly as pictured.I hope that the set I purchase for my new niece (going with Gossamer wings I think) holds up as well!"
2,Very disapointed,I have to say I did fall in love with this set when I was shopping for my baby registry. It looks just beautiful. So after getting all accessories for my baby shower all I had to buy was the crib set. I did so and as soon as I took it out of the bag I noticed the stitching on every piece was very messy and it was even splitting in many areas on the bumper and the comforter. I was looking forward to decorating my daughter's room and have everything else that goes with it and now I'm stuck. I'm very disapointed...
4,Pretty Purple Set!,I decided what my baby girl's room scheme would be based on this bed set. It is sooo cute and pretty. The fact that the butterflies match with other bedsets manufactured by kidsline makes it easy to find accent pieces like the butterfly rug and lamp. I received both the Paloma mobile and the baby einstein mobile as gifts. I tried both. I decided to use the baby einstein one because my daughter was more entertained by it. I think bright colors are better for mobiles and the paloma is pastel and not very eyecatching since it blends in with the bedding.
2,If Only The Type Was Large Enough To Read,"For some unfathomable reason the publisher has elected to produce a very small format edition (pages have lines only 3-1/2 inches long). Regrettably this appears to have been effected by literally shrinking the page size of a previous edition. This has resulted in a minute font which my eyes (even with powerful reading glasses) cannot read without also using a magnifying glass.Years ago, when my eyes were much younger, I used Assimil books in French and Italian ans was highly satisfied. The current Spanish course which uses the same approach is presumably equally effective.Iy you are young with acute vision I would highly recommend the Assimil series and award it 4 stars. Unfortunately for the rest of us the minute type font size makes it unreadable."
4,Assimil Spanish with Ease,Really like this type of Spanish course. It's clear and well laid out. I like that I can work on it at my own pace and whenever I want. I can repeat any portion of the course as needed. It's fun.
4,very good,"It is hard to learn a language on your own. OK. I have a relative who taught himself Russian, starting with the Assimil books. That is quite a recommendation. Spanish, and Russian, are both phonetic, that is what you read, you can speak. English is only 40% phonetic, and French even less so. I wouldn't want to try to learn English or French from a book, only. This is a useful method, and I am studying Spanish with this book. Me gusta mucho."
