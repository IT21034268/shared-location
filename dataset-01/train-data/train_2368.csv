1,Schopenhauer's advice,"Schopenhauer's advice to a dishonest guardian: ""Should you ever intend to dull the wits of a young man and to incapacitate his brains for any kind of thought whatever, then you cannot do better than give him Hegel to read. For these monstrous accumulations of words that annul and contradict one another drive the mind into tormenting itself with vain attempts to think whatever in connection with them, until finally it collapses from sheer exhaustion. Thus any ability to think is so thoroughly destroyed that the young man will ultimately mistake empty and hollow verbiage for real thought. A guardian fearing that his ward might become too intelligent for his schemes might prevent this misfortune by innocently suggesting reading of Hegel"""
1,I don't understand a word of it,"I wonder if the author had any intention to let his book be read and understood. Just too hard. Notoriously written. Still, after five years since my first encounter with this book, I don't understand a word of it."
1,Stay away from this if you love your life.,"Love your life time. Spend time with your kids, your friends... Go for a walk, see the birds chanting. Go earn money to buy a Harley-Davidon or a bad ass Bentley. Thank God I haven't read this, so I follow what I preach. Though I read Sir Karl Popper, that's the man to read. To him, the Sir, Hegel is an enemy of the open society. This was enough for me. I'm brazilian, and I am convinced english speaking sociologists, philosophers etc are the best. Utilitarianism (Bentham and Mill) and Pragmatism (Sanders Peirce) explains it all. Do yourself a favor: stay away from continenteal europe bullcrap. They've only caused wars and are famous for antisemitism. Anglo-saxan world follows the common law, not the roman-germanic system. Take advantage of this and run away especially from french and german intellectuals. There are some italians worth reading, but that's due to classical ancient world and its nowadays persistent influency. That's about it."
2,Too Obsessive For Me,"I found this book at North's Chuckwagon a long time ago. At that time I made a point to read it. I recently got around to it, and read it four times in less than a month. My opinion is that this book isn't Hegel's best. I think the philosophical reflection part is over done. I mean, it's obsessive. Hegel should see what a bizarre impression he's making in writing a book like this. I give the book a first star because of its cover, and the sly discussion of the master/slave relationship. I give it a second star because it re-whet my appetite for philosophy, and inspired me to get back to my early interest in the metaphysics of inductive inference. But that's Como!"
1,"Franky, I was unimpressed...","They say Hegel was big. They say he was important. Personally, I find him impenetrable. A man who writes this poorly deserves not to be read, which is just about his present status: unread and therefore ignored, yet still, perversely, revered. I say Hegel should be held up as an example of poor writing, radical obscurantism, ugly proto-fascist (Royalist-Kaiserist) politics and neologistic fantasism (what the hell is a phenomenology anyway?"
1,Ich hast Geist,"This is the worst book I have ever read. Don't read it unless you must for class. What Hegel didn't realize when he wrote this book was that neither he nor the World Spirit had yet attained to absolute knowing because my countryman, Kierkegaard, the very antithesis of Hegel, had not yet appeared on the scene. What still has to happen is that the spirit of Hegel must recognize itself in the spirit of Kierkegaard, and return into itself, thus becoming being in and for itself. This will be done through me, Henning Rasmussen, the Great Synthesizer...Anyone who takes Hegel seriously is a fool or a Marxist (still a fool), and is only trying to make a living in the university without caring for truth."
5,Where THE philosophy begins!,"You are a common person... thinking about things... walking on earth... reading some philosophy and so on...One day you think:1. What is philosophy? What is the specific object of that human science?2. There is so many theories, so many thinkers... who is wrong, who is not?3. Is there any theory of phylosophy? A philosophy of philosophy (or: a metaphilosophy)?And one day you read Hegel's Phenomenology (it is not SO hard to understand!), but the answers for those questions are there. And if you understand this book, then you will need the Science of Logic.PS. Plato is Hegel's master here. Do you know the ""Parmenides""? This is the main key!!"
1,A dubious landmark,"Before you get overawed by his reputation, its worth remembering that a healthy portion of philosophers, especially in the English speaking world, think that Hegel wrote a lot of nonsense, and its historical influence, in my opinion, is not overwhelmingly positive. I've been suspicious of it ever sense I wrote what I thought was a fairly dubious paper on its first section and yet still got an A on it. A lot of the prose reads like some sort of Burroughs-esque prank. Most contemporary analytic philosophy thinks early philosophers were too ambitious in gaining elaborate knowledge through reason alone, but Hegel seems to think they basically weren't ambitious enough. Essentially, if you channeled the rationalists through a megalomaniac, you might get something like this."
1,Phenomenology of Ennui,At this point in history Hegel seems crushingly obsolete and phenomenally boring. This bean counter's approach to philosophy and thought leads me to wonder if Hegel missed his vocation and should rather have applied his overly defined approach to accountancy than to human thought. A book strictly for die-hard philosophy undergraduates.
1,Phenomenal Arrogance,This book stands as the ne plus ultra of western philosophical arrogance.The basic problem that philosophers of Hegel's ilk can't accept is very simple-the world just cannot be analysed!! especially in neat little parcels like absolute spirit and absolute will etc.I mean if you even take something as basic as quantum physics-this tells us that with all the greatest apparatus at our disposal the very basic blocks of matter are unknowable in any absolute sense and that the defining fact of the universe if any is actually Chaos!Forget this book and read someone much more aware like Nietzche or even some Zen Buddhist tracts which revel in the beauty of man's inability to know anything rational and therfore celebrate his beautiful irrationality and spirit.
1,The depths of phenomenology,Hegel and Marx were responsible for an ideology that created the most repressive government in the history of the world (30 million dead Russians can't be wrong) and Heidegger was a Nazi.
2,A Translation which could use more care,"Unfortunately there is an oft repeated caution when approaching any translated text, but I might argue it is a particularly pernicious problem in the case of Hegel. Much of what Hegel is attempting to accomplish in this piece is break down Kantian categories and give them new dimensionality. In the German, for instance, Hegel uses the word ""sein"" (being) in various constructions brilliantly woven together to help the reader pick at the different linguistic formulations of what it means ""to be"". Unfortunately, Miller has given no clues to the reader to get to Hegel's meaning in the German, and instead often come across as bizarre instead of piercing."
1,Dissatisfied Customer,"While this book did offer general CAT test-taking strategies (though none of them earth-shattering), I was displeased with the quality of the CD-rom tests.First, questions were repeated throughout the three exams, as well as online and in the book. What is the point in ""testing"" yourself if you have already studied the answer to a question or have read the reading comprehension paragraph before?Second, despite relatively consistent raw scoring, my scores were so wildly divergent (750, 330!, and 650) that I never got an accurate measure of my ability. Okay, I may be a bit inconsistent in my testing, but come on!Third, the clock malfunctioned on each and every exam.PR should expect to receive a phone call and letter from me very soon!"
1,Disappointing!!!,"The only helpful section in the book was the writing portion. The CD was pitiful. The built-in clock didn't work, the CAT lacked a sufficient number of problems, and some answers were incorrect. Overall, the test gives a false sense of security. I recommend a GMAT course, but not with Princeton Review or Kaplan. A local college extension may provide a more cost-effective course with good results. My score increased by 15% as a result of the course. This book and CD are a waste of money!"
2,"Book is OK, but the CD ROM Stinks!","The book teaches some useful, time saving techniques that make the testing process more methodical. Although these techniques were useful, the CD tests were filled with bugs. I think the tests may give users a false sense of confidence."
2,Good Book but DO NOT BUY CD-ROM,"The book is great for learning the tips and tricks of taking the GMAT and I am satisfied with it but the CD-ROM stinks. Terrible. It is buggy, it isn't what is advertised, and it craps out your machine (I tried it on two). I also found that one of the questions on the CD-ROM gives the wrong answer! The printed book gives one answer and the CD-ROM gives another! Terrible. Buy the Kaplan book if you are serious about studying for the GMAT - you will get the same tips and tricks and a CD-ROM that works!"
1,Buggy CD ROM is infuriating and should be recalled,"Questions sometimes don't appear in their entirety. Drawing artifacts make it impossible to understand the question -- one time the question was scrolled off the top of the screen, but the scroll bar was inactive. The answers are clearly incorrect at times -- as though they only had 75 minutes to check it!This CD is an embarrassment. Princeton should be ashamed.Book is OK, but don't buy it -- it will just let them rest on their laurels."
2,Poor reproduction quality,"It's great to have obscure titles like these back in print, and I like this approach of scanning the original text pages instead of digitizing the text. But this reproduction is really bad: the type is so patchy that's it's only barely readable, and the illustrations are completely obscured."
5,High-Impact Strategy,"""High-Impact Sales Force Automation: A Strategic PerspectiveBy Glen S. Petersen""This media helped me make thousands of dollars from a greater margin. If you are losing money or sales, and do not know how to make a comeback, this media is guaranteed to spur your imagination.This media contains vital information that should belong to any existing retail/service business. The info is also great for entrepreneurs who will find tools saving them time and money."
2,Kinda works,Not reinforced well enough and will compress after heating but works well further away from the engine.
3,$1 bills are cut poorly.,"I still like them, but wish they are cuted better. The bills are smaller than the real one. I like the thickness of them."
5,Fun with play money,"I needed some play money for a business meeting. This product worked great--it looks very close to the real thing, but smaller."
1,Misleading,I ordered the product and with the expected 3-5 day shipping it came in the next day.I opened the product only to be overwhelmed by customer service and greatly disappointed by the product itself.The money is barely half size of a true bill and has multiple languages on the backside. (They don't picture it for a reason.)Overall highly dissatisfied with this product.
2,"Good, but not good enough.","I tried using this at Mons Venus on Dale Mabry and Tampa. Let me tell you, they didn't work well at ALL. After the initial shock of ""making it rain"" wore off, these girls were really pissed off. I ended up face first on the pavement outside, thanks to one of the bouncers. If your looking for realistic money, I suggest you keep searching."
5,Exactly What I was looking for.,I was looking for a bulk pack of realistic money and this was it. The paper was decent quality and the print is good. If your kids are into money then this pack is it. Comes with a lot of it!
5,Perfect,Very large quantity of high quality play money. Can't beat the value and much more than I actually need! Its about the size of traditional monopoly money which is fine for my purposes.
2,cute but run really small,"These shoes are very cute, the shoe laces are a bit short and they run very small."
1,Cancelled order,"Tried to order this product and they cancelled on me even though they show is in stock!Pediasure Liquid Complete Balanced Nutrition Enteral Formula Institutional Use, Vanilla - 8 Oz / can, 24 / Case"
4,4.5 stars,"Let me start off this review by saying that the only reason I gave this cd 4.5 stars is because I felt the cd was incomplete without the instrumental version of The Silent Enigma after Destiny.Some of the best metal songs I have ever heard are on this cd. The first being my all time favorite metal song, Fragial Dreams, and others being Lost Control and Inner Silence. Fragial Dreams is a song I listened to more times then any other song on any cd. This cd also contains some of the most beautiful guitar leads I've ever heard. And the solo on Lost Control is a classic. The acoustic guitar is just beautiful. Other songs that stand out on this cd are Regret and Destiny.This is the cd where Vincent's voice really makes a big improvement. On Eternity, his voice sounded good, but the improvement feally stands out on this cd.This is a highly recommemmed cd I think any fan of depressing metal/gothic/meloncholic music should have"
3,"JUST ""OK""...YOUR KID MAY FEEL DIFFERENTLY","This kept my daughter;s attention for all of 10 minutes. I bought it awhile back & never got around to reviewing the purchase. She was 10 at time of purchase, but your child may love it...subjective topic."
1,This does not exist - don't waste your time,I called GoVacuum to ask a question about the hose and recommended adapter. They told me they do not carry this product and have not had it for several months. They said they actually cancel the orders they receive from Amazon - don't waste your time ordering this one or anything from GoVacuum.
4,Excellent moral devotions,The devotions are short and powerful. Each offers a lesson that we can all use in our daily lives. A great book to read with your children and grandchildren.
3,Empty Homes,"Kate rebounded quite well to her situation, but I thought she was a bit emotionless toward what her husband had done to her.Her plan for her own salvation by helping others was a great one and I was disappointed to see her give in to her faithless husband so easily. She should have gone ahead with selling the home since she had already agreed to do so with a family and let crafty Cliff find his own salvation. But maybe things worked out O.K. anyway, just that she could have done more with the proceeds from the house sale."
1,The worst accounting book I have ever came across...,"Of all of the accounting books that I have read, this is the worst. Very very dry... Can you imagine that the author writes journal entries in paragraph form. There is absolutely no structure for the book, no summaries, no examples, no questions and answers.This book would only be useful if you have other references to go to. Otherwise, by itself, it will just confuse and discourage you from study governmental accounting."
1,Frustration,"This is a truly horrible book. It's written so poorly that the only way it can be used is as a look-up reference. If you don't have a really good instructor for Not-for-profit accounting, find one using a different book. You won't get much out of this.The 7th Edition is just as bad as the 6th."
1,Hopefully someone will write a better book on the subject.,"The book is extremely poorly written, difficult to follow with many topics only partially explained at best. The highly nuanced writing style results in ambiguous coverage and frequently the authors do not cover all elements of the accounting treatment, which are only discovered through reviewing answers to chapter quizzes. The on-line chapter quizzes do help to explain the appropriate accounting treatment. Some students advise me they elect not to purchase the book, but rather, visit the publisher's website to take chapter quizzes and use them as study guides."
2,Difficult to follow....,"I found this book very difficult to read and to follow. The information is all there, but it doesn't read very well...at least not for me."
2,I feel like I missed something,"I was disappointed with this book. As others have said this book really doesn't present clear cut examples in every chapter. While the text isn't hard to read, concepts could be explained in greater detail. When answering questions at the end of the chapter, the reader shouldn't have to flip through to look for the answer. I don't know of any other book on governmental accouting that could be used as an alternative. Had I looked at the book closer earlier in the semester I would have dropped the class. Unless you are an accounting major or have had other accounting classes, this book may be challenging (not in a good way). I had to rely upon supplementary reading and information from the professor to understand key concepts. Reading this book is like walking into a movie in the middle of the film and trying to understand what is going on. If you teach this class, please find another book or write one yourself."
4,Review from the student point of view,"While I was suprised by the small size of the textbook, It is packed full of useful information and examples. I've found that by supplementing the text with the website associated with it has given me plenty of practice and some excellent examples of what was expected of me. I ordered the book and it arrived on time and in excellent condition. If you have no accounting background then this text is not for you. If, however, you have taken some accounting before then this will be no problem. It's only a matter of learning the differenct titles for ledger accounts for governments vs. financial accounts for business."
2,Essentials of Accounting for Governmental and Not-for-Profit Organizations,"The information you get is useful, but is hard to follow in some aspects. There are not really any examples for you to try, making it impossible for you to see if you understand the material."
1,worst accounting textbook ever,"This is the worst accounting book ever that I purchased and attempted to use for my accounting class. I am a very good student with a 4.0 GPA and read quite easily. However, it was virtually impossible for me to comprehend what was in this book. It consists of hundreds of pages of blabber without any type of structure or common sense flow. It looks like someone got high and just started typing like a maniac, writing down the thought of the moment with some chapter titles and subtitles thrown in just before publishing. It is dense, exceptionally boring and poorly written. It was so hard to plow through this text that I ended up dropping it. It would have stuck to the class if I did not have to put up with this book."
2,"This is the worst accounting book ever, but i HAVE to read it for class..","As the heading said, this book sucks..1) I thought first off that the size of the book was going to be cool, but NO! The book always closes when your trying to do the end of chapter problems. If you want to flip between the in chapter problems and look up something in the book its almost impossible. Or, if you want a page open to write a definition you have to have your hand holding the book down to make sure you can write it.2) The book is super confusing and very dry. Im so glad i have a cool teacher for this class that really explains what they are talking about. I will read the chapter and not know what I read at all the next day.3) They don't explain anything!I hope no one else gets stuck with this book for a Government Accounting class."
3,Way to much lecture.,"Author spends WAY to much time defending MS and its OS. He also spends a lot of time covering other firewalls comparisons (whole chapter, almost 100 pages). Just write the book on the best way to configure ISA. We obviously run windows or we wouldn't of bought the book. Just my 2 cents."
3,fair,"I bought this book based upon recommendations from the reviews. It didn't live up to the hype.The information was O.K. but I found it missing detail on the different variations on where to install the device. It talked about rings of security but didn't really go into ""detail"" on how to set up different types.Different types being a edge firewall, front firewall, back firewall, or parallel configuration."
2,"In-dept, but Trihomed section needs some quality check","I've just got this book yesterday and now trying to configure a ""Trihomed DMZ Network"" from Chapter 7 page 591 through page 613 and found the instructions for configuring Network Rules and Firewall Policy very very confusing. Basically, the instructions for creating ROUTE and NAT network were basically the same thing - even though one topic mentioned to create a NAT network and the other a Route network (p. 602 - 603).So far, I have only experimented with configuring the Trihomed Network section and found the repeated instructions to be inaccurate."
3,"Great fun, but weakens over time",I got this for the office so I would have something to exercise my hand and just some silly putty to play around with. It starts pretty tough to work with put eventually as it warms up the putty resistance gets softer. Over time (2 weeks of so of frequent use) it becomes in my mind too soft. I would suggest getting one resistance up for those that want to use this to create shapes for fun and want to hold those shapes for a longer period of time.If you are using it I guess for its intend use for therapy it works pretty well as it has enough resistance to exercise the hand without immediately tiring the wrist or hand out.
3,if only this was just phil!,"I bought this cd for a raod trip and honestly i found myself skipping throught all but 1 song on the dave side, and i almost wrote the purchase off as a lose of money until i for the heck of it put in the ""other"" cd by the guy i had never heard of and i could not have been happier.With the exception of a couple of songs i fell in love with his song selection. #5 is the standout.It is worth the money just for the second cd. I promise."
5,quite possibly my favorite mix of all time,"it took a while to get into these two but now im hookd! CD1 favs transparent sound, hostile ground, GIRLS CAN BE CRUEL!, the push and in a state, CD2 (still my weapon of choice) one day, FURBALL, follow the white rabbit, MR. RUSH (the reason i bought this) and BORN TOO SLOW!!!!"
5,A Complete Album,"The synth-pop hit ""Love U More"" got me hooked enough to buy the album in 1993 not too long after it came out. Naturally, I expected a typical pop album: The song I liked, plus maybe one or two more decent songs and a lot of filler. What I got was a complete album, beginning-to-end. It's one of those rare gems you can stick in the player, listen for an hour, and not feel the need to fast-forward anywhere. I don't even know the names of my most favorite songs, since I never skip around to get to them -- I just listen. It's got a nice mix that flows evenly from trance to pop to dance and back, and yet it keeps a contiguous, unified feeling that never grates on you the way pop albums so often do. Today, almost 9 years later, it's still one of my favorite albums as a whole."
5,"Highly addictive, becoming more familiar than your own pulse","I'm not certain how I managed to become so attached to a CD that none of my friends have ever heard of before. I started listening to it, and then I realized how often I looked forward to playing it in the background as I drove, worked, and read. The beat of the music is now so familiar to me, that I know that my pulse latches onto it as I drive. It is not exactly the most thought-provoking CD, nor the most sensual. It is not the best dance CD. But it does combine those elements, with a dark passion and grace, which has kept me captivated for four years. It is still the most listened to CD in my collection. I highly recommend giving it a try, listening to the whole thing, and seeing if you want to listen to it again. And again."
5,Can't pass this CD up!!!!!,"Have been listening to this CD since it's inception. (I have yet to tire of it.) It is the perfect cure for the blues or just to give you a quick ""pick me up"". If your a fan of Yaz, you will most likely enjoy this track."
2,Missing Something,"I love the song ""Love you More"" and also love dance music in general. I bought this and just wasn't too impressed with it. It seems like it doesn't have enough vocals and the music is very repetative."
1,Disapointed,The watch ran for one week and then stopped.A new battery did not fix it. I had to return it. :(Severely disappointed!
1,Avoid,This book is typical of new Titanic books. It has no new info to offer ( ... ). ALso there are many mistakes that could have been cross checked. All in all this book deserves one star for originality. And one star for presenting the facts correctly.
2,Fair,"Some of the things in the book were good, some of it was mind over matter. I not really into that kind of psychology."
3,A decent toner,"The Edwal green toner is a fun and an easy toner to use. The green tone it produces is rich, however it will stain anything it touches."
4,good book with details a few colorful pictures though a little expensive,This is a good book containing a lot about high accuracy computation. Ten problems are discussed with details related to many areas of mathematics. A lot of codes of many mathematics software are shown with a helpful appendix. A web page of this book is also a highlight. You can even practice with it exhaustingly and enjoyably.
1,wrong item - again!,"This is the second time I have tried to order this item from Amazon. Both times I have received a foam set for a different case - WAY too small. Foam should be 18""x13""x7"". So far I've received two sets of 9""x7""x4"". Avoid Warehouse Deals! Somebody obviously put the wrong labels on. My first order had the right label (1201) and somebody covered it with a 1521 label. I didn't even bother with a third try!"
2,half of jewel cases have cracks. Some sleeve booklet crumpled,"Hi,I have no issues with musical content - this is what I always wanted. I bought it as a X-mas gift to my wife and the product arrived promptly.BUT, half of jewel cases have cracks in them. A couple sleeve booklets are crumpled.For $200 plus item I expected better condition."
3,ARE YOU CRAZY RICH OR CRAZY STUPID?,"Why would any one in the right mind plunk down [money] for 13 CDS by the same pianist? Is it so you can brag about owning 11 years' worth of the same old thing? Or did you get it as a gift designed to impress but not really to listened to? Now you could probably get [money] for it whether you used it or not. Columbia Masterworks should have brought along new and younger talent. For my bet I can't think of many American pianists who are currently recording. Do we have to recycle Schumann, Rachmaninoff, Schubert, Beethoven, Liszt, Chopin, Scriabin, and others over and over? This is the Twenty-first Century. We should at least be thinking of Twentieth Century piano works. I can get 10 CDs by 10 pianists currently recording if I look to Europe."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I am a technical writer and webmaster and it's my job to help people in our department with web pages and cgi scripts. Many of them have asked for a recommendation on what book would be helpful. I reviewed this book for that purpose and was amazed at how poorly written it is!! They are obviously NOT writers and honestly must have thrown this together over a weekend. Unless you already know what they're talking about,this will make matters worse. And if you already know what they're talking about, you don't need it. So far, my favorite intro book is ""Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web"" by Elizabeth Castro. Several on our staff are now using it and finding it very helpful, straightforward, not too much detail...etc."
3,Great Book- For the total beginner.,"This book is a great resource for the total novice in CGI programming. It has a couple good scripts, but if you actually want to learn how to write CGI yourself, this isn't the right book for you."
2,Examples need proofreading,"I bought this book for an online course. If I were trying to use it on my own, without input from other people in the course, I don't think I'd be able to use it. The examples vary from the explanations in the book; for example, in Chapter 5, Figure 5.3 tells you, when editing the $cntfile line of the configuration block of the vcount.cgi script, to ""Be sure to enclose all of this in *single* quotation marks...."" However, the example on the CD has everything in that line in *double* quotation marks. I'm not a programmer, and don't know whether this actually makes a difference (the script tests out fine in Telnet, but I have yet to make it work on a page), but this isn't the first discrepancy I've found in the examples, and it's very confusing.Also (and this is a minor thing), the plastic CD pocket in the back of the book was glued in backwards so I had to cut the CD out of it with a razor blade. Altogether, I'm finding this book to be more of an annoyance than it's worth."
2,Bad Coffee Maker,"This coffee maker was great, the first two or three times we used it. What could be better than having two travel mugs that you can make at the same time? Well, if you look at the design, the spouts come out each side, and they're connected by a bubble, which is lower than the spouts. So of course after a couple times using it, the coffee no longer went into the cups, but instead started dripping to the bubble, and right down in between the two cups. We deal with that by only brewing one cup at a time now.Our problem now? The mugs are plastic lined with Stainless Shells. There is a small notch in the bottom of the plastic, which is glued into the base of the Stainless area. After it's been heated up and cooled down a few times during brewing, the glue melts, and the liners start popping out of the shell. Then when trying to push them back in, the glue breaks and makes the problem worse. I would definitely recommend getting a different coffee maker."
4,A good one.,A good version of Serail... most of the arias and duettos are well sung... still not a brilliant version...
5,A Book Aout Design: Complicated Doesn't Make It Good,"This is a great book to teach basic principles of design in a simple, yet understandable way. It can teach ages from kindergarten to adult. I wish every elementary classroom could have a copy to help kids with their art projects!"
5,One of the few books to address basic design issues for young picturebook readers,"A Book About Design: Complicated Doesn't Make It Good is one of the few books to address basic design issues for young picturebook readers - and its advice and insights should be considered by many an adult, too. Simple lines, shapes, colors and humor explain why complication doesn't equal a good design - and why that fact matters. Pages of merely one or two sentences are accompanied by easy sample pictures to illustrate such basic design concepts as 'change the size of one (in this case increase it) and you lessen the impact of the other'."
5,A great read!,"Adventure, romance, beautiful country. What more could a woman want?Liked this one so much, I've ordered Baldwin's other titles. Can't wait to get into them."
1,Save your money......,"Bad, bad and bad. This book could have been condensed down to 5 chapters to tell the story. It was dragged out for no other reason then to make it a full book. I have enjoyed this authors other books, but this was was very disappointing. Save your money on this one ladies."
3,Okay book,I found it to be okay but predictable. There were times that I thought the main character was a bit weak.
1,spots after washing,These looked and felt great when I bought them. A few weeks after washing them in cold water with Tide a few times (no bleach) they faded and formed orange discoloration spots on them. Such a dissapointment!
4,Beautiful Set of Sheets....,"These sheets are very beautiful and look very nice on the bed. Very Eleagant. The thread count could be a bit higher to make them more shinny,brighter but all in all very nice looking. I am very happy with them."
4,Nice work,It is cool. It works well and it is a perfect tool. The kids are excited using it. Many thanks
5,Does its job,"PRODUCT REVIEW:Needed A/V cables for my old N64 so I bought thisIt does its job - lets me hear and see the N64SHIPPING REVIEW:- Arrived earlier than expected (always a plus)- Great shipping conditionNOTE: The cables are pretty short so if your system is too far from your TV,you would be better off buying a longer cable.Overall,5/5"
1,BAD BAD BAD BAD BAAAAAD,"i know this is a VERY. late review of the product but meh. I was sooooooo happy when i ordered the cable i had just found my old Pikachu N64 that i hadn't played since i was a kid and my ps one took its place lol. Anyways.... upon receiving the package i noticed the the cable wasn't that high quality but meh i really didn't care atm. I had gathered my console and a few games and was waiting readily to plug in and let the the nostalgia come flowing back and.... thats when it happened first the part connects into the console came apart and the wires were showing, i thought no biggie sure its a tad bit annoying but nothing good ole duct tape can fix, but thennn..... as i was unplugging the av cables from the back of my tv the metal male part that inserts actually got stuck in the av jack :l VERY VERY DISAPOINTED"
1,sucky cable,"This cable was bad from the get go, it looks like the cable in the picture, but extremely light and flimsy. Upon noticing that i had white snow marks throughout my game I took a closer look, and found out why this cable is so light and flimsy. They saved on costs by routing the sound through the video jack making the interference. Try hooking this cable without the white or red rca jacks. What do you know, we still have sound and crappy video [note you should only have video without sound if you hook up the yellow jack only]. Shoddy workmanship if you ask me. Take it from me if the cable you are trying to place in the gamecube end doesn't have 12 contact points inside do not buy return immediately!"
2,Fragile Connections,"I had the cable for little more than five days, then the wiring near the connections began to fray. I'll definitely say it reflects its price: Cheap."
5,ANOTHER METAL MASTERPIECE,"Opeth #4 continues the quality of their first 3 releases. Production sound is closer to ""Morningrise"" than ""MAYH"". Unpredictable as always, their sound is not one you will tire of. Just load up all their cds and take off on a journey to the center of your mind..."
5,Great Metal Album,"This album is a must for any true metal fan. It is a brilliant piece of work from start to finish. Its a mixture of heavy guitar riffs, progressive aspects and great lyrics infused into a beautiful story. The cd starts out with a stong force with the moor and soon slows down with the beautiful song benighted and quickly picks up with moonlapse vertigo. Face of Melinda and Serentity painted death are also great tracks, you wont regret buying this album or any opeth albums for that matter. Another great cd from a great band."
5,WOW,DO we need these long reviews?!?! Life is too short-- all I have to say about this album is....simply....WOW!!!!
5,Beauty and The Beast...,"Opeth is a gifted band. They move between styles like no other. In Still Life there's a bit more ""clean lyrics"" than in it's predecessors. The music is always great, beautiful and evoking passages, follow by explosions of brutality.Like a lot of people, i recommend this album ONLY if you're used to ""growling"", otherwise, you'll find yourself hating this masterpiece (and all other Opeth albums) because of that."
3,Vocals Annoying - Music Great,"I bought this listening to the sound clips. I never heard the vocals. I wished I had and saved my money. If you like raunch vocals ala Pantera then you might like this.I will say the music is top notch along with the production. But I cannot get into the vocals. I do have a guy at work that loves the vocals, but this is just not my style.Being fair and giving it a non-fan review."
2,"Wow, this is garbage",Just quit now. I can't believe I fell for the reviews and bought this piece of junk.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"What is this? I actually fell asleep twice during this album. People rave about this group? This is just plain embarrissing. There is not one memorable moment on this album. Opeth should really just disband and hide in shame, or at the least offer refunds. I mean, this was just painful to sit through."
5,Well worth reading - Fun,"I stumbled across this book one day at the local bookstore and, upon opening it, couldn't put it back down. I found the characters to be well thought out and realized, with the plot propelling them towards a fantastic finish. I will say this, if Hollywood ever goes looking for an answer to Robocop for the movies, it would be found here. Excellent reading."
2,very expensive eye drops,I was hoping to avoid cataract surgery for my dog and bought these eye drops. These drops didn't make his eyes worse but not any better either. They may have provided a little lubrication for his eyes but his cataracts are still advancing because he is almost 13 years old. I know that we all hope that these eye drops which costs about $100 would take the place of eye surgery which runs into the thousands but you might have better results than me. I have used the drops for over 3 weeks. The bottle when shaken drips on its top and is a little messy and you waste valuable liquid. They need to design a better bottle.
5,My 17 year old Bichon can see!,"I began using the eye drops only two weeks ago and already my 17 year Bichon's eye sight has improved to where he no longer jumps at shadows, no more jumping when I go to rub his body. He is running again on his walks. And he is back to watching my gestures and looking into my eyes. I am excited to see what the next weeks will bring to his vision. Even if it does not imporve any more then it is today I am completely satisfied. I am telling every dog owner I know or don't know about this product!"
1,This product simply does not work!,"My beloved Yorkie lost his sight to cataracts several months ago. Internet ads led me to believe that these drops could dissolve the cataracts. Well, at this time I am into my second bottle and Tiger is as blind as ever. The ads are extremely misleading. In fact, they are dishonest. My little companion, who is 13 years old, will spend the rest of his life in total darkness. OcluVet Eye Drops are a scam. Do not be deceived."
1,not the answer,My dog has cataracts. I stuck to the treatment program but OcluVet didn't help my dog's eye site at all.
4,eye drops,Amazon service extremely fast. The dog eyesight seems to improve and he now lies on his back to get the drops in his eyes
1,this product does not do what is represented,This product was represented to disolve cataracts in dogs...it did nothing...in fact my pet went completely blind after using it. It is way too expensive for the average person to afford for no good results. I would like a refund...but don't know just how to go about that. Please inform any future customers not to invest in Octuvet eye drops.
3,Eye drops,My Vet told me about this drops for my dogs cataracts. So far so good. I think the cloudiness is a little clearer. When I get close to the end of the bottle I'm taking him back to be check to see if it working. so if it works I'll be purchasing again.
4,Replacement Battery,This battery works great! I was very suprised to find that it works just as well as the expensive one. I will be back to buy more! Thanks!
3,not what I wanted,The tip is too sharp. It can injure your skin. Not so comfortable to use for this reason. It grabs tiny hair though.
2,Not precise.,"If your looking for something fairly precise and able to grab small things, I don't feel this is your item. It has a rather big bulky grasp so it wont really get the fine things you want with it. Your probably better off with a nicer set of tweezers."
3,Scissor tweezers,"I bought this product on-line so I wouldn't have to go to the store to look for it. It's OK, but cost a lot more than I would have paid for it at a store, and not as good as other ones I've had in the past and paid less for."
2,Bad quality,"These tweezerman 1209-r are a disappointment, not tight enough, so I can not boot the hairs on the eyebrows.If you other one, please ñet knowMidaswife"
1,Complicated rubbish,This product comes with no instructions I have yet to find a lense that it accurately fits
4,Important Contributions,"Not a light read, but definitely a fine contribution to Chicano letters is this collection of fourteen essays by some of this country's top Chicano/a scholars. -Katherine A. Diaz from Hispanic"
3,Not the best,"This was a fairly good book, but I expected more from this true story. The author makes some of his SAS counterparts seem like cowards and certainly not professional soldiers. This might have been his view of the truth but it seems a little out of the norm.Overall good read."
4,Every Soldier A Story,"I have heard that this author and the more famous other one that wrote Bravo Two Zero have both be accused of making their stories a bit more thrilling with a bit more bravado then actually took place. I do not know if that is correct, what I do know is that this story is thrilling. The book details a mission of British SAS troops during the Gulf War that are sent behind enemy lines to locate and call in air strikes on scud missiles. Unfortunately, they are found out by the Iraqi military and are separated into two groups. This book details one of those groups, which started with two solders.Overall the book really is interesting and fun. The author describes a story that keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat the whole time. There is real suspense which is difficult in a book about a war where there just is not that much battle for the character. It is just like a car chase without the cars. This is a fun book that reads like a novel."
2,ultimate praise for men like Ryan.,"tough man, and great fortitude, which is not discovered by 'selection' alone.orienteering and navigational experience saved Ryan's life, without which he would probably not have survived this conflict, although judging from my chair that is a harsh opinion.He did make some bad decisions, especially trying to avoid the goat herder, he and the dentist should have grabbed the situation by the root canal,but you couldn't hear me whilst i was reading it 7 years later!"
1,Sour Grapes,"Can you say sour grapes? I binned this book about half way through because I couldn't stomach the whining and blame shifting anymore,and gave it to a freind who reads cereal boxes. So go ahead and point out that I didn't read the whole thing so how am I qualified to comment.You dont need to read it entirely. The general tone of the book is summed up in the first few chapters and is basically a scathing attack on Mcnabs leadership and conduct of the patrol. What Ryan says would have been better left unsaid. Read ""Bravo Two Zero"" first, then ""Immediate Action"". After those two, browse through this one in a bookstore and you'll see what I mean. A more fitting title would have been ""I should'nt have got lost in the first place"""
2,Half-true and half-written: 2 and a half stars,"I'll make this brief: you'll read the book in a day or two and you'll be amazed at the fact that someone could make themselves sound so fantastic while writing so badly. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but Mr. Ryan should have been edited a little more thoroughly.It is, however, a truly amazing story. And I'm impressed and happy that Mr. Ryan survived his ordeal; but he should have stuck with the whole truth, warts and all, instead of engaging in that truth-twisting style that we all used with our parents when were 13 or 14: you leave out the bits that make you sound bad and you expand on the bits that make you sound good.At the end of the day reading this book is like meeting Mr. Ryan in a pub at 1 in the morning: he doesn't express himself very clearly, he slurs every now and then and he exagerates like a fisherman telling the tale of the ""one that got away."" How appropriate!"
3,Survival behind ememy lines during Desert Storm,"A gritty first person narrative of evasion and survival in the desert by a member of an SAS unit, ill-equipped, misinformed, and air-dropped in the wrong place behind enemy lines during the Desert Storm campaign -- this book is a gripping true adventure that gives the reader valuabale insights into the character and training of men who gravitate into elite fighting units like the SAS. It is one of several books -- despised by those who prefer to allow the SAS's mystique of infallibility go unchallenged -- that show how bad intelligence, bad timing, inappropriate equipment, and unforseen events can conspire to turn a special operation of even the SAS into nothing more than a death trap to be escaped by whatever means are available. Nevertheless, this story of survival is a credit to the SAS training and to the personal grit, determination, and never-never-say-die attitude that enableded Sgt. Ryan to ultimately be ""The One That Got Away""."
3,Another account of the infamous Bravo Two Zero patrol.,"While this book is a remarkable story of human endurance (Ryan walked 200 miles in seven days with very little food and water), I didn't find the writing style anywhere near as exciting as that of Andy McNab's, the patrol leader. Also Ryan didn't come across as a likeable person, and takes every opportunity to blame someone else for the failure of the patrol's mission. In view of this, it is hard to feel any sympathy for the author."
2,Fact or fiction,"Fact or fiction,in my opinion lots of fiction. Who am I to tell,well I had some questions after having read, The One That Got Away ,as well as B2Z by McNab.The questions have all been answered by,The Real B2Z(Asher),Eye of the Storm(Ratcliffe) and finally in the very good SOLDIER FIVE by Mike Coburn, the fifth surviving member of the patrol."
4,The real professionals.,"Whith all respects to Chris Ryan and the SAS whom both I admire, I beleive that Chris Ryan story is the valid one based on actual experience in special ops, Andy Mc Nab's story comes out of a comic book compared to Ryan account, I understand Ryan attacks on Mc Nab and I beleive he is right, What amazed me more in this whole story is that while the coalition was fighting this war in the Gulf not far away from them similar commando's where going with their secret wars for more than 10 years. I mean guys with more than 100 missions behind enemy lines and the worst of them, the ones the free world is fighting now, Guys who have real kills that counts in hundreds in one mission, guys who where mutilated in prisons and came back fighting, not writing books and living a trauma after 8 days of E&E. Those real secret warriors who will remain in secrecy with their stories and amazing experience, are the ones I call the real professionals."
5,Festive!,"I received candlesticks much like the Godinger Lotus candlesticks as a present two years ago; one of them broke because I was careless, and I had been looking for a replacement ever since. I was delighted to find what I was looking for at Amazon.com and this year my Christmas table absolutely sparkled with the addition of the newly purchased candlesticks. They are great!"
4,"Pretty, but delicate","When I unpacked these they were gorgeous! I immediately got out candles, but to my disappointment, the candle base wasn't large enough, so the candle wouldn't stand upright. I had to melt the candle slightly and ""melt it"" into the candlestick. It didn't prevent the candle from falling over from time to time.I stopped putting candles in it because it was so annoying with them leaning all over the place. Then the cat managed to pull down one of them on to the floor, and one of the leaves fell off. It doesn't really show, due to how I have them facing each other. I also put tea-lights in them, and they work better.While I don't regret the purchase of these, I am not sure I would have purchased them knowing what I know now. I now use them mostly as decorations in their own right, and not as candlesticks."
4,CHASING THE FUN BOOK,I LIKED THIS BOOK BECAUSE I LIKE MYSTRIES.I THINK YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK.IT IS COOL BECAUSE THEY DO LOTS OF COOL STUFF.THE BEGINNING IS NOT SO COOL BUT I LIKED IT IN THE MIDDLE.IF YOU LIKE MYSTRIES YOU LIKE THIS BOOK.I ENCOURDGE YOU TO READ THIS BOOK.
4,historic dvd,A master and productive violinist in his time. This dvd has a good cross-section of his music. A very worthwhile buy.
5,"A must read for scientists, under- or graduate students","Read it to prepare for my master's thesis and probably will use it for my doctoral thesis as well. Brings the detailed methodology for case study research in perfectly synchronized chapters. Extremely valuable information! Sometimes even Mr. Yin has so many info to provide he has some difficulty putting it all together, but after all everything makes a lot of sense. Has dozens of very good examples. I am purchasing ""Applications of case study research"" (the ""sequel"") because I was really satisfied for what I got in reading Case Study Reasearch (3rd ed)."
2,Not so wonderful as everybody told,"I have read the book and it is a formal structured discourse about how to do business cases.For academic researchers who have never been in a company, it can be helpful. But I have found it a little bit incomplete for those researchers who work in the arena, who have real contact with the companies.Any way, another link between the academic world and the business world"
1,The Sun Ra Orchestra: Pringtime in Chicago,Stay away from this production. The performances are uninspired and the sound quality is dismal. A total dud.
5,GREAT LITTLE BOOK!,"Detox Handbook, A Practical Guide to detoxing your Body, your Mind and your Life. Dr. Jennifer Harper shows you how to do it in this practical handbook packed with easy-to-follow programs. The Dr. tells you why Detoxification is necessary and how to use the Book, there's a Questionnaire and Pages on Naturopathy, Nutritional Medicine, Herbal Medicine, Aromatherapy, Reflexology and AcupressureThere are Three Levels to go through and the Dr. shows you how to get there one by one with many Advice and Suggestions and many Color Pictures. I specially like the Catalogs of Foods where Dr. Jennifer Harper writes in detail the ""Superfoods"" for Liver Function, Culinary Herbs and Spices, Oils, Cruciferous Vegetables, Fruit and very useful Information, Detoxing the Mind and Emotions, Affirmations, Breathing, Flower Remedies, The Importance of the Soul ...and so much more, you get to learn a lot. It is a very Helpful Book! D.D. Thank You"
2,Wasn't what I was looking for...,"This book was not what I was looking for. The first third of the book rehashes the benefits of natural living and offers information that is of little value to anyone who has even a cursory knowledge of such things. The actual method for detoxing was broken into three levels which would seem easy to follow, but the book is terribly disorganized. There were three types of detox: body, mind, spirit. It would be much more helpful to systematically organize the book using the levels rather than the different types of detox.I did appreciate some of the advice offered in the ""Mind Detox"" section, but would not recommend this book."
3,"enjoyable, but not her best!!!","""Home Fires"" is a story about love, heartache, and second chances. I felt that this book moved very slowly unntil close to the end. Then, Maggie chose to joyride with her friends instead of obeying her parents. This episode was by far the high point of the story, building up to a very predictable conclusion. Rather disappointing!!!"
2,I had to skip parts just to get through it.,"The book has a very intriguing premise--two people who suffered horrible loss finding each other. I tried hard to like it because I admire people who endure hardship without becoming bitter, but I never felt drawn into the story. For me, the author does too much telling in describing her characters, repeating facts again and again, without much showing of the characters' natures. It seemed as if the author was forcing the story instead of allowing it to unfold for the reader, which left me ""uninvested"" in their plights."
4,"Great Story, Great Read","A re-release title from LuAnn Rice. Very interesting character and plot development-the reader sees the promise of this deep, thoughtful 'new' writer.I loved Anne from the beginning. She has the right to grieve her little girl. And, what woman wouldn't fall in love with her rescuer fireman. Devlin has ghosts of hisown that he must deal with. One is life after disability. He carries scars from a past fire that almost ended his life. Maggie, Anne's niece, seems hell bent to join her little cousin that she was so close to. (I love the scene in the attic.) By helping Maggie with her loss, Anne can begin to live and love again. Devlin, Anne, and Maggie give to and get from one another what each needs.I was sorry to see this one end."
5,This stuff is great!,My hair guy asked me what I was using on my highlighted hair. This stuff keeps my hair soft and shiny. I love it.
3,very runny,"I just purchased this for the first time and the contents are very runny.....I never used it before, so I can't compare it to another bottle....also it really didn't lather very well...."
2,Something is off with this bottle,I've been using these shampoo for the past year and for some reason the bottle I purchased here was a bit runny. Each morning when I attempt to pour a small amount into my palm it gushes out. It's terrible and I'm not sure why the consistency is like this. It's not supposed to be.
2,overseas movie music,"I purchased this after getting all ten volumes of the Easy Tempo collection. The Easy Tempo collection concentrates on all Italian movie themed music from the 60's-70's and I thought that this collection would be equally as cool...its not. There are some nice songs, but overall, it doesn't hold a candle to the other collection. If you are looking for great movie themed music with a jazz tilt, start out with the Easy Tempo volume 6. That cd is a winner. This one is simply fair."
5,2000 and 2007 CDs are identical,"Just to be clear, the 2007 reissue has the same 18 tracks as the original 2000 release. However, the track listing on the back of the 2007 CD incorrectly lists 17 tunes (leaving out ""Le Temps Des Loups,"" Georges Garvarentz). Amazon picked up the shortened listing. But they're all here--and they're great!"
1,Rip off and rude,"I purchased this for party favors at a child's party. It is very misleading to show a photo of the group and not just one ball. Regardless of what the description says--the photo is a misrepresentation of what you are selling. And with the cost of shipping, I think it would be safe to simply assume that it was a set of balls.I also must say that one of the reviews had a very rude comment back from the seller. Way to go--you've managed to be not only ignorant yourself, but also immature and. What's the expression? ""the customer is always right?"""
1,never got it,"I had to cancle the order, because I keeped getting notes that it was on back order when I order it I was told it would be ship in 2 to 4 days"
4,Oh my!,"Heavy in bondage & submission, plus some s&m, this is an erotic novel, in first hand description, of a ... adventure of one woman who is bent on acting out her darkest fantasy. Not for the faint of heart or for the casual reader of romantic and erotic novels, but a worthy depiction of ... intensity."
3,"So close, but...","This is almost a great recording. Chailly, Nucci, Horne, Ramey, Dara, the La Scala forces, all are supurb. Tenor Paolo Barbacini, as the Count, however - well, let's assume he was ill during the recording sesssions, because he sounds just awful. The tone is forced, the coloratura is hammered and throaty. The poor man seems to be straining for every note, and the sound is not pretty. For me, at least, this painful performance ruins an otherwise splendid recording. Be warned."
1,SHAME SHAME,THESE TITLES are just a clump of terrible choices surely there must be a better group of movies too pick so customers could be happy with the selection of movies group together than this selection.
1,A Cheap Box-Set,"This Box-Set from Fox is a joke. Instead of having 75 classic movies from the Fox library, we get at least 50 classics and 25 mediocre movies just to fill the set. And like others have mention, it's not worth paying hundreds of dollars for the DVD of Cavalcade. Just wait for the eventual single release. Save your money."
1,I'd buy this in a second ... IF ...,"... it was being released on Blu-ray.This collection is clearly being aimed at the high-end, collector, cinephile market ... the Blu-ray demo to the letter ... so why is it being released only on standard def DVD?"
1,causes breakouts,"I break out every time I use this cream. Derma-e makes great products, but this one isn't for me."
5,Hoping it is NOT the Last Viking book...,This is not one of the 4 book Viking Series but I liked it just as well. No other author can hold a candle to Sandra Hill and her Viking stories. A worthy read.
3,Dubious Suspension of Reality!,"Ms. Hill's Viking romance was decently researched (a good surprise) but not true to the feel of the Viking world. While I realize that her intention was to be entertaining rather than realistic, I must be at least a little disgruntled-- what a waste for me as a reader not to be completely thrown back into the Viking Age with her good research! I crave a serious Viking romance, for once!"
2,Boooooooring!,"Too much mall shopping, talking about sweatpants, lame fight scenes and teasing. If you are looking for a GOOD viking romance chock full of sexual encounters I suggest Josie Litton's Dream Of Me. WOAH!"
3,Alright Guide,"Not the best, but overall it gets to the point about how to present different images and ideas in graphic design."
1,Do not buy unless you have to.,"I got this for school, I thought it would be a good read. I was wrong. I could have passed the class without buying the book."
5,another excellent book,"Again, I enjoyed the people, the place, and the times of the story. I enjoy good, clean, books, always have."
5,Book #2 in the series,This has been my favorite book in the series. You'll step back in time and see how people were living in this period of time. It's an excellent series. Very enjoyable.
4,Book #2 - Good!,"Sweet book and the author helped me visualize to the point that I felt like I was actually there. Characters were interesting, although there were a good many of them. I very much appreciated the lack of cursing and foul language! Will be downloading the 3rd book in this series."
5,Love the whole series,"Very entertaining read...I grew very fond of the characters, and couldn't wait to finish the series to see what happened next."
5,I love these books,These books are really lovely. The only problem is they end. It's a good thing the next one is already written.
3,Great read!,"Historical, Christian Fiction. :) Need I say more?! I love this series. There are many characters and new ones are introduced throughtout the series, all easy to relate to and easy to love."
5,The Courtship of the Vicar's Daughter (The Gresham Chronicles Book #2),I was looking for a good story with family values. Realistic and well written. The story could have happened in life today.
4,the gresham chronicles(all),all these are well written and family oriented!good christain reading for all ages.i would recommend this book again and again.
4,Great series to read,"This series is a lot of fun to read and full of interesting characters and their relationships. At first it was hard to keep track of so many people, but I got hooked on the village of Gresham and its people. Biblical truths and interesing people had me going back for more. I just wish there were 10 books in this series so that I would have more to look forward to. I really enjoyed these books very much!"
5,excellent read with wonderful characters,I purchased one book by the author and was hooked. She develops her characters in an interesting and moving way. I can't stop reading other books by her.
4,and the story continues.,"I have thoroughly related to this family and village. Loved the characters. A bit predictable, but enjoyable just the same."
5,Most Enjoyable !,I went straight from the First book in this series to this one. I couuldn't put it down. I love these characters and the way the author writes. I am now headed off to the third in the series. :) Just a lovely book that anyone in the family can read and enjoy. Would love to see this made into a movie.
5,Great series!!!!,"This is part of a 4 book series and I cannot wait to read the next two - great characters, funny, warm story lines. I am not usually a fan of historical fiction but this series is worth a look by everone who enjoys good, family oriented books."
5,The Courtship of the Vicar's Daughter,This book is the continuation of the people's lives in the town of Gresham in England. There are many human interest stories within the bigger story. I highly recommend it.
3,okay,This book also well written as was the 1st in this series. My only complaint is: the ending. I actually expected more. It just seemed to stop. Not completed. But still was another one of those books I had trouble putting down.
2,Picard Daughter,So many nuggets of wisdom in approaching problems that come up with Godly wisdom and in a positive way. No quick fixes for a happy ever after. It is enjoyable to follow the families in Gresham village. I am enjoying the Gresham Chronicles and will be lookng for more bookss
4,Close to 5 stars,"Mrs. dev-dav here, I loved this book. I would have given it 5 stars except I did not like the title. I think it should have been called ""The Courtships of Gresham"" for it focused more on other characters than the Vicar's daughter Elizabeth. I got ""The Widow of Larkspur Inn"" as a Kindle freebie then I did something I rarely do...I bought this and the remaining books of the series. They did not disappoint. It was a wonderful escaping into a different time and place for a few days. I would love to return to Gresham someday. I will say that it did take a bit of getting used to the author's abrupt way of changing scenes to introduce new characters in the first book but by the time I was reading this one it was fine. Again, close to 5 stars. Very good read!"
4,Review for Managing New Products,This is an amazing book for people planning to specialize in marketing and are currently pursuing an MBA degree.
4,rare translation,"This edition of the Euripides plays contains the rarely read ""Cyclops"", not a great play but important nevertheless to a complete understanding of Euripides or Greek drama in my opinion. Just as the other translations in this series is rather conservative, so too is this edition. A good, reasonably priced version for undergraduate classes."
4,"OK, but not what I expected.","ID4: Silent Zone was a very good novel, but the action was a bit lacking. The first few chapters were good enough to grab my attention, but after that, it was a bit dry. Overall, ID4: SZ was good, but I wouldn't read it again."
5,a great sequal to the greatist movie ever,it talks about the events leading up to independence day.Should be made into a movie it was greAt
4,What are other people lives really like?,"The first-person format works well for me. It does a good job of presenting the huge variety of tasks people do for money, and the broad spectrum of emotional reactions people have to their jobs. It's not a life-changing book, but it is very interesting."
5,Should be required reading for High School Seniors,"I liked this book a lot. It's just interesting, but it also is thought provoking for people wondering what career path they are going to take."
4,Book gives honest look at real life,"This book is a great show of how American people are in reality. Reading this book has been enjoyable as well as informative. As a journalist, I cannot imagine the amount of effort it must have taken to get the types of interviews done in this book accomplished. I feel like I know the person after I read their chapter. It is definitely worth the time and money. Gig is one of my most valuable books."
5,Gig,"Gig is great. Studs Terkel's Work, though an amazing contribution to American literature and the understanding of how other people in our country live, could be pretty dense, especially to modern readers. Quite a few moderns saw it as useless because of its age and how antiquated it seemed; they ask why would you need to read a book about, like, an elevator operator? Gig, however, is a thoroughly modern (in a good way, though!) tour of the modern american workplace. have you ever wondered what the life of a telephone psychic is like? who clean up crime scenes? how do FBI agents work? what are modern steel plants like? even if you haven't asked those questions, I'm sure you'll be delighted to find the answers out. They're all in this book-- just flip around."
4,An Interesting Look at Jobs You'll Never Have,"This book is basically a collection of stories told about certain jobs, told by people that work them. The individual stories are translated into a monologue and give you a sense of someone telling you how it is without a filter.I found it pretty neat to read about certain aspects of jobs -- how people find gratification in what might otherwise be a demeaning job or the complexity and stress involved in different jobs. It kind of gives you an idea of what your bus driver or customer service rep may go through. In some cases, you wish for a followup to see if people attained the goals they mention in the book.It's good to read in short bursts. All in all, the story of the American workplace can be a compelling one, but like all jobs it can be a little boring."
5,Very humanistic!,"I love this book. Funny, touching, inspiring, everything a book should be. The depth of reflection in each of the accounts is profound. Helps me better understanding myself and the people that make up our great nation. Get it, you won't regret it!"
5,A must read,"I read this book years ago after graduating high school and it completely changed my view of work and life in general. I can recall parts of this book from memory - the Wal-Mart Greeter, the peanut vendor, the temp - and find my subconscious dwelling on little nuggets of wisdom from the book's interviewees.Makes a fantastic gift to high school and college grads or anyone looking to expand their knowledge for how others go about their day."
5,Great book to see how other people live today.,"This is a great book that shows how people that live around us but don't have our profession view the world. It is written in small monologues where the person interviewed is just talking about him/herself in the way that they want to talk without an interviewer steering them in any way: so you get a lot of information by seeing what they find most important of their job and they choose to share with us.After reading some of the interviews I found myself wondering how would it feel to be somebody else, I felt that for a moment, I was inhabiting somebody else's life, and felt delighted to see how happy everybody was no matter if they were a traveling salesman, a food stylist, a[n] ... escort, an FBI agent, a congressman, a palm reader...It's a beautiful book that showed me that there are people for everything, and that this diversity is what lets us live all together in this world in almost complete harmony."
1,Worst Book Ever Written,"Discussions in this book about other religions are absolutely false to say the least. Many facts are simply wrong, the least of which is the discussion about the rituals of Hinduism.Anyone who reads any of Franklin Graham's books must not take a single word of the discussion of other religions seriously, for his books are filled from cover to cover with blatant and gratuitous religious intolerance.Instead of this book, I recommend reading Voltaire's Treatise on Tolerance, ISBN: 0521649692"
3,not for the young reader,"I found this book interesting and very readable. My purpose in writing this brief review is say a word of caution regarding one of the stories told to Mr. Graham regarding the rape and murder of a young girl, her brother, and father. It is extremely graphic and horrifying. It is disturbing, and not something for a young teenager or preteen to read, in my opinion. I understand that the purpose was to illustrate the suffering ocurring in that part of the world, but it was very out of place with the entire rest of the book, and I was unprepared for it. I just want parents and sensitive readers to be forewarned."
5,An Exellent Read on Franklin Graham,"In my humble opinion, Franklin Graham has written a frank and honest story of his struggles growing up in his famous father's shadow and how he has eventually formed his own identity.Franklin describes many details of his life:1. Growing up and early years in North Carolina.2. Relationships with his family.3. Going to school and the rebellion against authority he displayed.4. How he eventually came into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.5. His own marriage and family life.6. His involvement with Samaritan's Purse.7. How he became involved in preaching himself with the BGEA.8. Important people and missionary travels he has been on.All in all, this is an excellent story by someone who is continuing the Graham legacy. While some people may not like his convictions, one has to admit that at least you know where he stands.Read and enjoy. Highly recommended!"
3,Not the Peter from the annex,"I loved the premise of this book, even though I knew Peter had died in the camps. It was very brave of Ellen Feldman to take someone who was practically iconic and base a novel on him, knowing him to have perished. However, having done that, she did not make much of a reference to the relationship between Peter and Anne in the book, especially given the title of the book. Mostly it was about his madness, his fears, his paranoia based on his experiences in the camps. And I did not believe that his wife would have gone on unquestionably as she did with a man who was so hidden from everyone, including himself. That Peter could not face who he really was was an interesting idea. That he could not face what he had been through was also realistic. But his family life did not ring true for me. And his ""memories"" of Anne were virtually non-existent in the book. Overall, I believe the concept is fascinating, but its development did not play out for me."
2,"Left out the things that I thought would have made this book worth reading,","such as what did Peter experience in the camps, more insight to his struggles before and after liberation. The overall story was a good idea and it was a 1 night read for me, but I found it somewhat frustrating because so much was missing. When Peter finially admits who he is , the book just fades out, leaving you feeling ""that was it!"" However , it was nice to imagine he did survive and left me thinking this really could have happened, he could have really survived and if he did what would he do."
1,Doesn't work with Sony DSLR-A100,Make sure it synchronizes with your camera prior to purchase.I purchased this brand new and tried it with every possible combination on my Sony DSLR-A100 and it never flashed in sync with the A100. I am going to try it with some other cameras.
3,Beautiful watch...seller lies with the retail price...,"I bought the watch the last week and just received it today, so you can see that seller ships very fast. The watch is beautiful, small (which is exactly what I was looking for) and looks great overall.My only concern, and is that why I give 3 stars, is that I can't understand the need of lie with the retail price. This watch obviously is not a $30 watch, as seller says. When you receive the watch, you'll see one tag and one label (in front of the watch case and in the bottom) that clearly states MSRP $19.99...Please, let's be honest....."
5,Love these shoes,These shoes were great for my son. They held up wonderful. I liked them so much I ordered them twice in brown and now in blue in the next size.
1,Ripoff of a ripoff,"If you are not familiar with the series of which this is a hollow imitation, Neale Donald Walsch's ""Conversations with God"" trilogy, I urge you to check these out first, and then laugh at this ridiculous attempt to morph mainstream Christianity into something other than what it is: intimidation and pettiness. While Walsch's books are not flawless themselves (in fact, they are painfully derivative of New-Age mantras), this book stoops below even these. It is almost not even worth the time and effort to scoff at, if this tells you anything."
1,Loud and defective,"This microwave looked great, but otherwise failed to meet even minimal standards for microwavery. It was incredibly loud, much louder than even the 20-year-old microwave it was intended to replace. In addition, there was no air emerging from the rear ventilator, as there should have been, it failed to heat water during the self-test described in the operating manual, and it emitted a foul odor when it was running. It seems like I got a defective model, but given how loud it was, I'm not inclined to give it another shot with this brand or model."
4,Sharp R-420LW Family Size Countertop Microwave,"The microwave is large inside. It works well with defrosting and re-heating foods. The only thing that I dislike is the viewing section. It's made of plastic and they had a label on it that left glue so when I used a scrubing pad to try and remove it, the pad left scratch marks which can never be removed."
5,Migraines? A Must-Read,"A comprehensive, reader-friendly, and scholarly review of the many facets of life with migraine headache, by one of the most prominent head-pain physicians in the world. Read it, if you need help with this life-altering problem. There's no magical cure, and no salesmanship; just good science and helpful advice."
3,An in depth look at the hits given and taken in the NFL.,The NFL crunch course shows how tough the NFL really is. It shows all of the greatest hits up until 1985. This is a must see.
5,just what you'd expect,Everybody who wants to see big hits will get just what they wanted with this one.
5,IF ONLY AMAZON WOULD PUT THE ARTISTS ALONG WITH THE SONGS.,At this point we are left to wonder if this is a legitimate compilation or some knock-off cover-band's handiwork. With all the so-called ''tribute' albums for fairly newcomers would you trust this without knowing the artists? I wouldn't.I have provided a scan of the back cover so that you can see the artists and that this is in fact a legitimate compilation featuring the 'real' artists responsible for these songs.
4,Amazing output.,"When you ad a Horn, such as the Dayton, it puts out an amazing amount....I used a 15 watt Amp and it worked great for church project."
2,You get what you pay for,"It is a cheap driver and delivers cheap sound.I had a differnt cheap driver Pyle PDS772 and dropped and broke one, and blew the other of the pair probably because my crossover was not good enough and I pushed it too low frequency. This was rated for a wider frequency response so I gave it a try. I only bought one. I guess I knew it was too good to be true. I'm too cheap for the JBL $400 drivers, so I guess I'm back to the PDS772. and I'll cross it over higher and steeper this time.If you want it to sound like the PA on M.A.S.H. then go right ahead and buy this one. If you want good fidelity, try a PDS772 on the back of that 20"" Dayton horn, and find something to fill in below 800Hz. I found 4-10"" box. Better yet a Peavey FH-1 bass horn. With this I can fill a middle school football game with quality sound."
3,Parkman doesn't quite make it,"Words cannot explain the complexity of writing involved in Schnittke's Penitential Psalms, but Parkman and the Danish National Radio Choir can't seem to add the finishing sparkle on Schnittke's works. Further proof can be found in their recording of the Choir Concerto and Minnesang. Look to the new ECM recording with Tonu Kaljuste and the Estonian Philharmonic Choir for true brilliance."
1,listened to first sample,"not even close to the score...DO NOT BUY THIS CD..AVOID..read my comments over on the ECM release...there too the Estonians miss, but are certainly closer than Parkman...please Polyanski record this music soon...I will begin praying tonight for this request. God will hear."
3,A really sloppy update,"The latest additions (since Volume 4) are not as well-written or comprehensible as early ones, and the new diagrams were obviously done by someone who didn't have the foggiest idea what he was drawing. Many of them are unclear, and a surprising number are downright incorrect, which undermines confidence in all of them. This book sorely needed a good editor."
4,thought provoking,The people in my group of readers often commented that the book was not an easy read but was very worthwhile reading. The chapters are very thought-provoking. They have made for good discussions and have helped to examine well-known ideas from a fresh perspective.
3,"Good for ""normal"" buttons","This product works well on normal buttons with reasonable button holes. If you have larger buttons, such as on men's pants, you may have difficulty removing it from the button after you hook it."
2,Short life expectancy,"I bought two Good Grips button hooks. The wire portion of the button hooks appears to be cheap, paperclip quality metal that is poorly anchored in the handle. After a couple of years of light use, the wire broke on one hook and became loose in the handle of the other."
4,Just what I was looking for!,I bought this hard-to-find item for my 92 year old grandmother. She suffers from Arthritis and has a hard time buttoning her 'blouses'. This item works perfectly. The handle is large and comfortable for her to grasp and the loop pulls buttons through the tiniest of buttonholes. Great product... I highly recommend this item.
4,None,Good Grips Button HookIt works reasonably well buttoning. Unbuttoning is a little more difficult.
1,Easily broken,The Good Grips Button Hook came apart after only two uses. I would not recommend purchasing this item.
5,Good grips button helper,I bought this for an 88 year old man. He was having such a hard time buttoning his shirts for church. He absolutely loves it. No more fumbling with his arthritic fingers trying to get his shirt buttoned.
5,Great device,I purchased this for my Mom. It is a great help to her since she lives alone and has trouble with her fingers.
4,Button Hook/Puller Not Perfect,"The handle on this button hook is its best feature and makes buttoning quick and easy. However, the wire isn't small enough to fit into some of the smaller button holes on my blouses. I tried to use it to button my jeans but because they were tight fitting, the wire wasn't strong enough. Using this button hook to unbutton a shirt or blouse is a lot more work than buttoning it. Overall, it's a good product and I don't regret buying it."
2,For 2 hands,"I agree with other reviewers about the flimsy construction. The wire is not anchored in the handle so you can't manipulate the button by twisting the handle.So.. you struggle & struggle trying to get the button to pull through the hole. I've used it for an hour,got very frustrated, buttoned 3 buttons. I'm going to Epoxy the wire to the handle to see if I can get some twist action. The large handle may be a plus for some folks but for me, I'd rather have the thing work better. I guess I must have all of the button devises & NONE of them will really work with a man's shirt using only the right hand.I've added this edit Jan. 2013. This button tool continues to be an gravation. Epoxying the wire didn't help much. The shape of the wire bend keeps disengaging the button when trying to ""wriggle"" it through the hole. I'm stubborn about trying to make a thing work, but this thing is a bad joke as far as I'm concerned.The large handle is of no value at all if it basically won't work."
2,Button Hook,"After about 20 uses, the two wires came out of the handle making the button hook unusable. The wires should probably be there to ensure they stay in the handle."
2,"It's okay, I suppose.","We bought two of these. One works well, the other... not so much. It goes off randomly. We've try moving it, reassembling it... nothing works! The other works fine. It is best for a small space though, as it doesn't throw tons of heat!"
1,NOT as discribed,"Item is not was it says it is.At time of purchase the Product title was ""ArctiClean 60ml Kit (includes 30ml ArctiClean 1 and 30ml ArctiClean 2) and 3.5grams Arctic Silver 5 Thermal Compound""It was supposed to include 3.5grams Arctic Silver 5 Thermal Compound. It only came with the cleaning and removal bottles."
5,ArcticClean prep kit outstanding,Outstanding solution for installing a new CPU or rejuvenating the TIM. Though it's a painstaking 2-step process if done right the results are well worth it.
5,Really clean,"If you are planning to change the stock thermal compound to an artic silver, the stok compound has to be removed in order to obtain a better performance in heat solution.This kit includes the remover and the cleaner surface. Is really good because thermal compounds are very hard to remove manually."
1,I wouldn't buy this item from LLYtech,"I'm not sure if it was the seller or the product, but I ordered ArctiClean 60ml Kit (includes 30ml ArctiClean 1 and 30ml ArctiClean 2) Item arrived on time, Unfortunately Bottle 1 arrived half full and obviously opened prior to receiving item, there is wear on sticker as well as the seal on the lid being cracked open. I do not trust it's contents due to it's condition"
2,ArticClean 1 & 2 Review,Product did not perform satisfactory at all. I had to redo the job. Product failed to clean part. Auto Carb. cleaner worked miracles. Also rubbing alcohol. Both cheaper and 10 times more effective.
3,Product does what its supposed to.,"Removes thermal paste well, not sure how much of an improvment over alchohol it is but when dealing with a $200 cpu, i played it safe. When I recieved the package it was leaking and was all over the other items I ordered with it. Called the company and they stated it is indeed a Hazmat so handle with care. Amazon was great about the spill and sent out a brand new package with two day shipping right before Christmas. As always Amazon customer support is supurb and makes happy any sad. Just be aware this product could ruin anything else you ship with it."
1,only came with bottle 1. and it is damaged.,"i only received bottle 1 and it is damaged, there is some damage that cannot be attributed to shipping. the sticker is old n warn and a weird hole in it. i also never received bottle 2. beware this manufacture uses old bottles and refills with their own stuff and sales it."
5,Very useful,"The Sorcerers Crusade Companion is different when compared to other general RPG source books. This book does not contain a lot of game mechanics or new powers. It provideds all the necessary information to run a historically accurate Renaissance game. Everyday details such as fashion, food, behavior, and culture were all presented in just the right amount. The art of swordfighting, plants, famous Renaissance figures, and Umbrood were discussed in the core book but was elaborated here. Most importantly, the book discussed the other cultures of the world during the Renaissance and their beliefs. This opens a lot of doors for games involving explorers and diplotmats. This book is a must for the average gamer who knows little about the world during the Renaissance and would like to add some accurate historical flavor to their games that might otherwise end up like generic D&D adventures."
1,"Why would you print a book about bad eyesight in tiny, hard-to-read font?","The font was so small, I couldn't read it. It was a complete waste of money.This is a rip-off book."
3,More.....,Very interesting book. Not much information on how long treatment should continue. Is it a life long therapy or what? The book left me wanting to know more.
2,Not worth the money,This book is nothing but a promotion for a specific brand of NAC eyedrops. NAC eyedrops work (I am using a different brand and my opthemologist confirmed that my vision went from 20/50 to 20/30 in 6 months!) but I am not using the brand in the book and the book basically says that other brands will not work.I was hoping it would give more info on the actual research.
4,A large step forward,"This was a huge improvement on Melanie's charecter. As well as adding to Melanie, it also builds on Allie, who I am liking more and more with every book.It is a shame that Harper Collins is ending this in mid stride, and I hope they reconsider."
4,Very Good,"Okay, Melanie isn't my favorite character, but because of this book, I'm starting to like her. I'm glad that Mel isn't dating Jazz anymore and that she and Kevin got back together. I never really liked Jazz. He didn't even care about horses. The only reason he got interested in them was just because Melanie was. And I'm glad that Melanie gets to keep Hi Jinx for herself!These books are starting to get more awesome every time! The bad news is that HarperCollins is going to shut them down! I really hope they will reconsider, I love this series!"
5,haven't read it yet but....,"they CAN'T cancel thorughbred books, they just CAN'T. Seriously, i already signed the petition to keep it going, you should do it to if you're reading this! go to www.whitebrookfarm.com and save this series! this is a great series! help us save it! even if u dont know what im talking about or dont give a crap, save this series, go to the site and sign the petition! what can it hurt? PLEASE! do it!"
5,NOTICE,I have yet to read this book but Im sure by now everyone has heard that the Thoroughbred series will be ending after book #72. Please got to www.whitebrookfarm.com to find out more and sign a petition against it. The series was just starting to come around after a few disastorous books and many people would like to see them continue. Help save THOROUGHBRED!
2,in Stereo?,"Though the performance is spirited, the recording seems to be mono. The orchestra sounds thin and far away because of it. I would not recommend this CD."
4,Great Pair of Pruning Gloves,"Tired of getting my hands and arms gouged while pruning roses, I decided to give these a try. They did the job! I love their flexibility, and they really kept the thorns from penetrating. My only complaint is they do run small, for me especially around the arms. If you're wearing a long-sleeved shirt, make sure it's not too thick."
1,too expensive,"The gloves fit well, but seem to be only for very light garden work. The fingers tips have torn within a months of use, and this was not heavy gardening work. Also as others have noted the gloves are thin and do not protect from thorns.Overpriced and overrated - would not buy again!"
5,Best gloves ever!,"I have both the standard and rose gloves. I use the rose gloves for roses and cutting out dead bamboo. Bionic gloves are extremely durable and flex in all of the right places preventing any hand fatigue from the glove.Neat trick with leather gloves when dirty/muddy is to wash your hands with mild soapmand water with the gloves on, then dry with a towel and follow with leather conditioner."
4,Women's Bionic Rose Gloves,My wife loved her rose gloves. They fit perfectly and protect her arms well. They're very comfortable and easy to work with while pruning her roses.
5,Exceeded my expectations!,"These gloves were recommended to me by a friend. When they arrived I was pleased with the construction, the materials and the fit. I ordered an XL because that was all that was available. I usually wear a M but they fit just fine. I would suggest ordering a size or two larger in these gloves. I attended the Southeastern Flower Show in Atlanta and was happy to discover that they were the #1 recommended glove by the rose experts at the show! The true test was when I wore them to cut back my 8 Knockout Roses. Not a prick nor a scratch did I receive! The gloves are comfortable and provide the protection I was looking for."
3,nice gloves but not thorn proof!,"Extremely comfortable -- I sometimes forget I'm wearing them while pruning and start to weed/clean up, BUT, they are not thorn-proof (or as thorn proof as I'd like them to be, having approximately 50 roses in my garden). But great for general gardening pruning/trimming chores -- the length does protect your forearms."
4,even large not big enough for man,"I bought these hoping to avoid poison ivy. I received the woman's large today. I'm a 36-year-old guy and have small hands for a guy. I thought they might fit. They didn't. I can get my hands in the gloves but they're just a hair too small.1. The diameter at the base of my fingers is too large2. The base of my hand is too wide.3. My fingers are just a little long.Checking on their web site, they don't even make men's rose gloves. The gloves are also a shorter than I had hoped. They don't reach the elbow. I'm going to try the west county gardener rose gauntlets and hope for better luck on the fit."
3,Disappointing,Action packed but the storyline is disjointed. Producers trying to make several storyline fit into one and flow of the movie felt awkward.
3,Average,"Great A-Listed Korean Actors, but after a few minutes into the movie, I already knew how it was going to end. Rate it as an average!"
5,INSPIRATIONAL,"I recieved the bible as a gift from my sister and I have never felt so understood as I do whenever I read the notes, from these wonderful women of God it makes me understand and know the great love God has for me and everything that concerns me, I just want to say thank you and keep up the good work you all are an inspiration to me."
3,Ok Multimeter At Best,I've used these at my work for years and they come in handy if your checking just your standard motors or basic electrical equipment but I have several gripes with these. #1 is that the meter only goes to 1K ohms which you can't check a lot of smaller coils or rheostats since they often go to 5k or 10k. #2 is that if you had ever had to trouble shoot a lower voltage like 24v dc the meter will show the highest reading in which sometimes there are phantom voltages that will show like say 30 vac but negligible voltage on dc. The 3rd gripe is that the leads are too thick and the exposed tips are too long some times. They often wouldn't fit on smaller terminal strips. Or you might short the lead between the test point and something you didn't plan on touching if you you were working in a tight area.
5,exellent service,"exellent service, fast and the producto was as expectado. exelente servicio, fue rapido y el producto fue lo esperado.el producto llego en buenas condiciones, funciona muy bien."
5,Great meter,"It a Fluke need I say more? I find in life you get what you pay for. If you want a great meter this is it, look no more."
4,It'll do the job,I needed something that was up to code. My old meters were just...old. The ohms are slow. It takes like two seconds to get a reading.
5,Wish everything was designed/built this well,"I ""inherited"" my T5-600 when somebody left it behind afterour company had a massive layoff back in 2003. Mine shows nosigns of trouble and I don't foresee replacing it anytime soon.Over the years I've come to admire its very straightforwardfeatures, solid construction and the thought/engineering smartsevident in its layout. (Jeebus! this is starting to sound likea paid endorsement - it isn't). In fact I was only lookingit up here out of curiosity to see what its replacement costmight be because I was beginning to wonder if maybe I hadn'tended up with a far more expensive unit than I'd first thought,given the many times I'd found myself impressed with its design."
5,Perfect for my needs,Talk about simple to use! This thing is stupid proof. I absolutely love it. You can always count on Fluke to produce a real quaility tester....and they make something for every person's needs.
1,This Gibson exhaust SUCKS,"This gibson exhaust SUCKS! Did not fit right on my 2010 Chevy Colorado, installer had to bend pipes to fit.Cannot put tire under truck or tire rubs on pipe.WOULD NOT recommend this to anyone.This bad review is against Gibson not Amazon!"
4,Autobiography,"You need a mix of books to understand the rebellion. Part of the mix is first person accounts, and these must be a mix of general's and enlisted men's memoirs. This book helps with your understanding of a very complex war."
4,I felt as if I was with Sam through the war.,"After reading Co. Aytch I felt as if I had marched him throughout the war with Sam Watkins. From the day to day to day trivia of army life to the emotional highs and lows of each campaign, Sam relates his experiences with a matter of fact delivery. One of the most readable books I have read in years."
3,"Interesting insight, but tainted.","The greatest charms of this book are its most fatal flaws: Being an account by an Confederate private soldier it's certainly not objective - Watkins is unashamedly and understandably biased; further, since he was a private, neither is his point of view broad or precise. His recollections of persons, dates and events are at times inaccurate which is understandable since he wrote these memoirs twenty years after the events they recount.For no other reason, this book is socially valuable because it was written by a participant of the Civil War, not for its historical merit (or lack of)."
1,Informative but boring,"I read this book for my Civil War class. Normally I enjoy books on history, but this one tried my patience. It's overly informative so that it's difficult to keep track of the names and dates. Plus, the information is presented in a way that nearly had me comatos."
5,Military Memoir Marvel,"Surely themost informing view of the pasr is the personal diary or even memoir. Often in the military genre we find that what is written in a diary after the battle offers a ver different view than the mrmoir written some time later. Sam Watkins's memoir is the exception. I doubt a diary wou read substantially different from this book. Sam is a mature man who sees through the gloss and temporary glory of the moment both on the field and from his armchair. If you forget the name on the cover, you can believe the person responsible for it goes by the nom de plume of Mark Twain. This is not a book for the military library, it bellongs in every library."
2,Save Your Money,"Although this book is well written and contained much information, there was little information included that is not already available on Google's Help pages for free. Buy this book only if you don't like reading online help pages."
3,Dogs LOVED it but not sturdy enough,I have a one year old rottie and 6 year old American Bulldog. That loved this toy so much I really wanted it to last! The rope part came out within 5 minutes and by the next morning our squirrel friend was without a head.
5,Awesome Book,"This book is FIRE! Definitely a page turner. I bought it years ago, and I still re-read it. If you like drama, this book is for you."
4,Starting Drama,This book caught me in the first few pages of reading it. It was very hard to put down. Great book.
4,Sibelius + Ormandy = Essential!,"Essential Classics brings us one of the great bargains in the Classical catalogue.This 1957 recording is far better sounding than you might think. The stringsand brass are a great deal more extravagant and open than they seem to be inModern recordings these days. The Sibelius 2nd symphony gets a commandingperformance and mainly in the finale and the structural design of the symphony isheld together well all throughout. The 7th symphony recorded three years later,is very impressive indeed. It is wonderfully paced, as well as very intense.They seldom make recordings like this anymore. The world was a different place."
3,Complete but not clear,"This book is a quite complete review of two dimensional models, from the Thirring model to Conformal theories, passing by QED2 and QCD2...It can be a useful tool if you already know something about the two dimensions: the authors are sometimes not clear and make involved what is simple."
3,Not fist fightin' Neutral Rating of 3 stars,"Interesting book from a period of modern history. However, it is devoted to basic locks and take downs. If you're looking for information on self defense based boxing techniques it is not here. Conversely, if you are looking for some quick to learn street techniques you would be satisfied."
1,Not that great,"Having been a long time fan of Championship Fighting I was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately it falls into the 'glad it wasn't expensive' category. It's a nice interest book to add to a collection given the name of the author, but I was expecting some fairly efficient self defense techniques. I found the ones in the book weren't that. In most cases if you could implement the technique shown there'd be a lot quicker ways to have got the same result."
3,Somewhat average anime,"I am a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist, so when I heard this series was co-written by the author of that series, I thought I would try this series. I feel like this was a pretty typical series, not horrible, but nothing too original either.Spoiler (kind of)Seven different warriors who are tied to the stars that make up the Big Dipper are drawn into a conflict to determine the fate of a country that is similar to China. Allegiances change, characters die, good characters ultimately win in the end.Like many of these 26 episode animes, I felt that the ending was kind of rushed. There were a number of larger fights in the last 2 episodes that could have gone on longer or been more intense."
3,A Fifth is enough...,"The main problem with this re-issue comes again in the re-mastering phase. (See ""Incredible"" review) The album is not without some wonderful performances, but having to re-jique your stereo's EQ to properly hear them, is a trial even for big fans of the late accordionist and folk singer. If you forgive the sonic shortcomings, you'll be treated to fun recordings of ""Kelligrew's Soiree"" and ""Doggie Doggie, Bark at the Cat"" and mournful readings of ""Wicklow Hills"" and ""Erin's Green Shore""."
3,Intense skill on display here!,"These guys are some of the greatest musicians on the planet and here they give us a live set of tunes that display their chops! I have been following these musicians for years and always get anything they are involved with but I would not recommend starting here. Try their studio efforts first with bands live OTV, Planet X, and any of their solo CD's to get an understanding of their varied styles and technical sensibilities. Then you might like to get this and hear how they pull it off in the live setting. Great album for true fans of this genre of music (rock/jazz/fusion) and certainly for fans of these gifted musicians."
4,Great book,"This book is very contagious and is an easy read. However, there is a strong use of vulgar language and that should be noted. Drugs are also mentioned frequently in the book, which may been seen as controversial/offensive to people. If those things do not bother you, you will like this book, or it will remind you of high school. I also would not consider it a mystery as the mystery has been solved the second the even happens."
1,Honestly,"Honestly, I was really disappointed when I received this book. I bought the new book but the quality of this one was terrible. The cover had a lot of scratches and there was even black marker marked on the book. Also the edge of the book was terribly destroyed, and one part of the book cover was folded."
2,Gets worse each time I read it...,"This is one of those books that a) read really racist only a few years after they're written, and b)are really off when it comes to speculating about the future.For example: this book rah-rah's the United States, glossing over ther racism experienced by Japanese, Chinese, and of course, the Hawaiians. The fact that Hawaiians got screwed out of most of their country, is ignored, as is the massive genocide of Californian Native Americans.What's most striking to me, though, is the utter lack of vision- McDougall utterly doesn't anticipate the rapid rise of China, (who ""always slays itself"") nor the torpor of present day Japan.McDougall's also quite ignorant about how things haven't really changed in Japan (the power centers are still pretty much what they were during the war, only now, they're just not militarisitc.)"
5,I love this music and this version.,It reminded me of seeing it when it was on TV the first time. I really love musical and these actors.
5,Missing track,"I'm glad this is available in mp3 format, but there is one track missing, probably my favorite one in the movie. ""A Lovely Night."""
4,"A lively, entertaining ""Cinderella""","If ""Cinderella"" is second-string R&H -- John Simon has called it ""anodyne"" -- it is very entertaining R&H. Even after 37 years the second CBS special has a glow that suffuses this album. It's cruder but livelier than the 1957 affair as this is a true soundtrack album, unlike Goddard Lieberson's strictly studio version; the cast is more energetic, likewise John Green's conducting. The faults are the same; as Alec Wilder said of the sublime ""Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?"", the composer seems to have changed stations before the ending. But it is still great fun, a rare quality found perhaps in ""Flower Drum Song"" and not much else. Note: the engineers decided to record this not for the stereo systems of 2002 but for the little TV speakers of the mid-sixties, hence the sound is somewhat compressed."
3,Flawed vocally but musically exceptional.,"Another R&H mixed bag. With the exception of Stuart Damon's mellifluous and beautiful singing, the cast is a dud - can't act, can't sing! The orchestrations are however lush and beautiful - musically and sound-wise a fine recording of the music from the production - but stick to the 1957 original tv cast with Julie Andrews for perfection."
5,Build Your Money Muscles,"Once in a while, I read a book that truly transforms my life. Build Your Money Muscles was such a book. Joan Sotkin's unique and penetrating insights into the roots of money problems helped me shift my perspective on my financial situation and make some difficult yet rewarding decisions. I recommend this book to anyone who is dissatisfied with their relationship with money and desires to make a shift."
5,Native American Cross Stitch by Julie S. Hasler,Beautiful and breathtaking designs. As a first time cross stitcher (now hooked)I found the instruction in this book very user friendly.
2,Limited Audience,"I sent this book back. While it has some good information in it, it is two tied to the author's religious beliefs."
4,great phone,this is a great little phone..my carrier is cingular...and the phone is t-mobile..but no worries...i just put my sim card in and it works...only one minor problem..i cant access the web to download ringtones..but i really dont care about that at all..
3,It was OK at first,"I bought it from my sister a gift. is a good phone and works Perect with Digitel in Venezuela. It was OK at first, but after a year he was hurt to flex the lid.se lo compre a mi hermana de regalo. es un buen celular y trabaja perecto con digitel de venezuela. Estuvo bien al principio, pero despues de un año se le daño el flex de la tapa."
5,My current favorite,"A strong tea, great for the morning. I actually get two still-strong cups out of a bag, without it tasting like dirty water."
3,Good for the price,"This one was to replace a very old one like it that finally broke after many years. This new one isn't as well made and has some plastic parts on it, but it does work and the price was decent, so there you go. I couldn't find one exactly like my old one, and didn't want one of the bigger, bulkier ones, and this one came the closest to what I was looking for. Go ahead and give it a shot, I say. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time, too."
5,Correct type and on time delivery,"I received the product on time, Thank you!This was for my Sun Light Lamp - Lights of America.At first, I thought I bought the wrong light bulb, since it was difficult to fit into the slot. Once it fit into the slot, then everything is fine. It will be helpful if it has direction on how to install this light bulb."
3,Know What You Are Buying,"When I bought my new Superior Floor Lamp for Sewing & Scrapbooking - Nickel, I broke the fluorescent bulb (this one). It is extremely fragile. In fact, today, I just bought my third bulb in two weeks. Now the Superior Lamp is fantastic and looks great, but I would highly recommend you see this light while it is lit and working. It's good for reading and fine handcrafts, but I personally find the light unnatural and obtrusive. The florescent is much more than you would get with a regular florescent blub - much bluer. With four prongs of bulbs, there is a lot of light as well. I was unable to find a bulb with only two prongs. The questions remaining are; is the light comfortable for your eyes and your purpose and is your lamp in a stable enough position that it won't fall over. As I stated, this is a fragile (but not terribly expensive) bulb. It will suit some people's purposes."
2,not lights of america bulbs,"the bulbs i received were not lights of america 9024B bulbs, but some other generic brand with your name on them. why was this not disclosed to me before purchase?"
5,excellent service,I ordered these bulbs and got them in 2 days. They have a fantastic glow. Even the electrician who installed them and the fixtures was impressed. I bought extras as they were very inexpensive. Great buy.
5,Kids love this,"I did not plan to buy this but I am glad I did; it is the most used ""digger"" of all. It seems tough and my grandkids love it."
5,This richly illustrated book details over 150 plant species.,"This richly illustrated book details over 150 plant species used by First Peoples/Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest Interior.Revised and redesigned for easier use, this handbook includes detailed botanical descriptions and notes on habitat and distribution.Groups covered are the Stl'atl'imx (Lillooet), Secwepemc (Sushwap), Nlaka'pamux (Thompson), Okanagan, Ktunaxa (Kootenay), Tsimshian and Athapaskan groups in the north, and others in northwestern U.S.A.Nancy Turner explains how aboriginal peoples harvested, prepared and preserved the roots, leaves, fruits and other parts of wild plants. She also describes some non-native food plants used by interior peoples and several species they considered poisonous or inedible. Color pictures enhance descriptions and make identification easier."
5,An exellent book on the subject.,"What can i say. I have numerous books on the subject and this one, like all the others books written by Turner, are top ranking. With detaild information on how the plants were used by indiginous people."
1,disappointing,I thought this might be a rare treat; instead a disappointment. Difficult to understand the author.
4,excellent,This is an excellent camera. I bought it for my 14 yr who loves to snap pictures. It is very compact so it can go anywhere. The picture quality is good for her purposes. It is extremely easy to use as far as downloading onto the computer and emailing pictures. I would definately buy again.
4,"Wonderful Prose, but Dated","Roger Angell is a wonderful writer, perhaps the most gifted writer in recent decades to approach the game of baseball in a serious way. The chapters here fully support his reputation. But, despite the fact that this book is a 1992 reprint, it will be a tough and largely academic read for all but the most hard-core baseball or Angell fans. It chronicles the 1977-1981 seasons: an era of Reggie Jackson, George Brett, and Tom Seaver; an era when newly-won free agency brought gasps with contracts worth half a million dollars.Those days are long gone. Die hard fans might enjoy spending a weekend reliving them, but the more general public might be better served by more recent Angell books."
1,Bethlehem lights,I'm returning these lights. They are much smaller than I thought they would be plus they are very cheaply made. I would never hang these on my patio!
5,All Our Yesterdays,"I bought this cd for one track really ""Dancing In The City"" and it hassome great other tracks, ""Uptown Top Rankin"" and ""Motorbike Riding"" are brilliant."
5,"""Law and Order"" in the REAL World","This is a fantastic book that brings the reader to counsel table in the trial of a cop killer.The human side of the lawyers defending horrific homicides is brought out....the book reads like a suspense novel.....If people want to know the truth about what transpires during a death penalty trial, this is one great place to start."
4,Fast read... with some gory details,"Kevin Davis presents a side to the justice system - and of society - that does not generally receive positive public attention. I think he relates the facts fairly, and paints an almost comprehensive view of the characters who work at the CCPDO. I cannot claim a lack of bias and / or prejudice (since I work there as well), but overall I think the lawyers who work on Homocide Task Force are some of the best in the country, and I am proud to call them my colleagues. Best of all, they are great storytellers, humanists, and try to make a broken system work as best it can."
4,defending the defenders,"An interesting look at public defenders. It might have benefitted from a more critical/academic look at some of the tactics (a la A Civil Action), but then again, that might have made it a boring read. The book also seems to operate under an assumption that most folks probably don't believe accused murderers deserve a fair trial. That assumption might actually hold true, but it's a perspective that can be alienating to those of us who do."
4,Dancing Day,"RE: CD Dancing DayDo like this composer-arranger's style. It causes my mind and body to dance. The ""Presbyboppers"" fine musicianship enhances each piece - even with no keys (Lost Keys in Kennedy) The vocal instrument doesn't match the brightness and freedom of expression of the other instruments. Jesu Joy, Latino? Why not! Did notice the Beethoven within Stays Straight. Each time I listen to this disc I have a different favorite. Connie Page"
5,Don't pass up this record,"The Neville brothers together and individually have been making music in New Orleans and around the world for nearly 50 years. Their better known incarnations include The Meters which had only two of the brothers, The Wild Tchoupitoulas which was a brief single LP with all four of them, and under their own name probably best known for the hit ""Fiyo on the Bayou"" or ""Hey Pocky-a-Way"".This new record represents a true culmanation of the talent of the Nevilles - not just the four brothers but several offspring that join in to help imploy some modern recording techniques and greatly improve the end result. The songs are strong, personal and socially aware. They are varied yet very cohesive - pure New Orleans R&B; / Funk.I hope the Grammy people don't get too consumed with the current trend to synthetic grooves, and still have time to appreciate and honor some of the masters of the organic traditions."
5,I can't put it down,"This wonderful guy is not only a hero to animals but he's a very talented writer....amoung other things.Listen....if you're committed to helping animals and want to get friends or family to come over from the dark side & stop supporting the animal killers, THIS is the book to get them. There's not a boring sentense in the entire book.....it's fun & interesting. One page and they'll be hooked.Hey....I'm back here to order several more copies....EXCELLENT WORK DAN!"
4,Funny,"If you'd like to understand PETA a bit better, this is a good book to read. I've always had some issues with PETA, even though I'm a member myself, this sort of educated me a bit.And Dan is pretty funny, which always makes a book fun to read."
5,It Will Turn You Vege Over Night,"Both highly entertaining and full of scary, disgusting stories of the atrocities committed to animals world-wide, this book made me feel nauseous, horrified, and finally inspired that one person can make such a difference. It made me want to give up meat, join PETA and Dan in his animal crusade. Strongly recommend for animal lovers, those thinking of becoming vege and needing an extra push, and anyone wanting to do something more with their lives beyond a regular nine-to-five job."
3,A Gay Man's Journey,I know that a lot of vegetarians and people who support PETA are buying this book but that is not necessarily what the book is about. The book talks more about how a young gay man grew up and came of age. My main complaint about the book is that Matthews tries to make things sound bigger than they are.
5,I loved this book,"This book is hilarious! Even if Dan Matthews was writing a narrative about paper towels he could make you roll over laughing, but this memoir really has it all--celebrity gossip, personal drama, and you finish the book not only with sore stomach muscles from laughing so hard, but also with the feeling that you have learned about an important social issue that doesn't get enough attention from main stream media. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking for an enjoyable way to learn how to make this world a better place."
5,A Must Read!,"I love a good activist story, so I bought the book. What a treat! It wasn't a ""lecture"" in any way, yet it really got me thinking about some of the choices I make. This guy is the real deal. Dan Mathews work makes it clear that all of us can make a difference, and collectively, if we all made even a small effort towards treating animals with compassion, the world would be a better place for all."
1,Disappointed with Veterinary Anatomy Cd-Rom,How do you expect me to review something that I can not see? I expected to see some clips of the work for me to review. My experience with this visit suggests that little forethought has gone into helping the viewer meet your expectations. I'm an Associate Professor of Veterinary Anatomy. My students could benefit if your images are realistic and well done.
2,A silly book,"This book is downright silly! Find something better on the matter. Trust me, there is plenty out there."
4,I am Surviving !,The Survival Guide was very informative and I reread alot of it.I don't think that I would make it through Menopause without it. I would also recomend Discover Your Menopause Type to anyone whos interested.
3,Somewhat lacking,"Having read this lengthly discourse, I found it difficult to pick out the answers to the questions that I was trying to answer."
1,Don't waste your money,"The first chapter of the book is well written and hooks you in. From there it is all downhill. The plotting is terrible and totally unbelievable. The ending is sprung upon the reader with no lead in. The title ""Canine Capers"" has nothing to do with the alleged mystery; the Huskies are simply pets who the author has talk to each other about food, walking and playing. Further, the book does not appear to have been proofread. It is fraught with errors. Very disappointing. While the author's subsequent books may have improved, I won't be taking a chance buying them."
3,chewed,I was very pleased with this product until today. Iv had it about a month now. It is very cool and cool. My dog likes it and lays on it and it did not leak in the month I'v had it. How ever this morning I found it fliped half way over and my husky had pulled off the red stopper on the bottom and chewed it up and half the water in came out and into the carpet. I wish the stopper on the bottom was protected in some way so dogs could not get to it or pull it out. Then again its hard to protect anything against a husky. The bed does cool extreamly well and I liked the product more then I thought and so did my dog. I will try to get a new stopper and figure out how to cover it or maybe spray it with an anti chew scent.
5,great for over a year,"the bed has been great for my retriever. add the coldest water possible by using 2 or 3 gallon containers and putting them in the freezer until they start to develop a little ice on the surface and keep bed shaded. honestly i have not had any issues with the construction at all, and i have abused the hell out of it. seriously. i think it's great."
1,Definitely not worth it...please read before purchasing.,"I bought this bed hoping (at any cost) I could keep my boxer cool since she loves being outside all the time and doesn't know when to come in to take a break. Quite simply, the bed, regardless of technology claims, does nothing to keep it cool...all you're doing is adding the coldest tap water you can find into a poly sheath w/ a poly foam core to maintain the tap water temp as long as possible. The concrete on our porch actually retained the cool from evenings better than this bed did w/ tap water. I even tried to add a bunch of ice cubes once in hopes that as it melted at least the water temp would be lower...even that didn't work. Save your money!"
5,My dog won't sleep anywhere else,"This is the best thing you can do for your dog, specially if he or she is arthritic or furry and always hot. I started with a medium one for my 30 pound Pom and now I bought him the king size and he's just loving it!!!"
2,"Great, but leaks eventually","I have purchased at least 3 or 4 of these for my dog. She absolutely loves them, and lays on it every night. However, after 6 months or so, every one of them has started to leak at the seam, and we have to throw it away. The leak starts slowly at first, and then suddenly one day the carpet is really wet. They are a pain to move around too since they are heavy, if you buy the large one. Very hard to fix, too. I don't know if getting a bed sheet would help or not. Maybe we should reinforce the seams with duct tape before we even put water in it?But my dog (70 pound border collie mix) does really love this, summer or winter. So... I suppose I will get another one. I am a sucker for her sweet black and white face. :)"
2,I bought two,"I bought two of these and the sheets, and set up one for a trial run. I have had it six weeks and my dogs (5) don't go near it except to walk across it. One of my dogs peed on it with the sheet on it, so I removed the sheet. I would think one out of five dogs would like it, but not so far."
5,My favorite Chopin CD!,"I just cannot understand why nobody has written reviews on this great music at Amazon, for this CD has been my favorite Chopin for years!!! Though Fou Ts'ong is not as famous as his friends such as Lupu, Argerich, he is also great,very great! Don't wait, buy it! You are going to like this CD.(I remember it was scored *** by Penguin...Right?)"
1,"Disapponted, this is NOT complete",This item does not come with a special reflective target that is required for use. Nor have I been able to find one elsewhere. It does not tell you that in the product discription and you only discover it when you open the product to use it and it says in the single instruction sheet that the target is not included.This would probably be a great product if it came complete. With out the target is is not useable.
3,Maureen Forrester does not do justice to this great work,"A Missa Solemnis recording succeeds or fails based on the quality of the soloists. It's a given that the choir has to be excepitional, so the soloists are the deciding factor. The bass and the contralto soloists are the most important voices in this mass, but for me the contralto is the only voice that matters.Maureen Forrester just does not get the job done here. If you want to hear an exceptional contralto sing Agnus Die with authority check out Florence Quivar in Helmuth Rilling's recording of Missa Solemnis. Maureen Forrester sounds like an untrained novice by comparison. Florence Quivar...a command performance!!!!Don't dauddle, get the Helmuth Rilling recording of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis NOW!!"
2,Bramwell Tassel,"appealing to the eye, but kills the instep of the foot due to the design of the shoe."
1,FAKE,This filter is a fake filter and not a filterqueen filter. It voids your warranties and WILL break your machine!
1,POOR FACTORY SUPPORT & DESIGN PROBLEMS,"On my first day with this unit the charging system did not work and the blue tooth wirless system failed to work. I tried to get factory support and all I got was failed promises. After five unsucessful calls, I'm in the process of trying to get my money back. I'm very unhappy with Tom Tom and I'd recommend looking elsewhere. This unit has all the great features but for nearly $900 I expect to get good service."
2,tomtom rider,"i have a garmin quest fitted to my bike but recently had the chance to use a tomtom rider for a few days. they do not compare. considering the rider is twice the price, it is no more glove friendly than the quest, and the bluetooth feature is a complete pain. why no simple headphone socket? the directions were difficult to hear on the motorway, full volume is only about a quarter that of the garmin. with helmet speakers (of your choice) the quest gives simple to hear directions, in stereo.the quest comes with full european mapping, for no extra.i will not be rushing to buy one and do not reccommend it as particularly ""motorcycle friendly"", obviously no bikers were involved in the development!"
1,"Abandon all hope, those who enter here","This is the worst motorcycle product in the known universe. I got a TomTom Rider; the bluetooth headset doesn't last long enough for a long trip and can't be plugged in a charger and operate at the same time. What a great idea!Oh, if you plan on keeping the product for more than three days, forget customer service. Spares are already unavailable for TOmTOm Rider, because ""we don't sell it anymore.""The GPS itself is useless. Bright sunshine, forget it. If you want to use the GPS for more than 3 hours, forget that too because the cradle won't work and charge from your motorcycle's power supply.Now, if I were using this in a cage, it would probably be OK. Its not a bad GPS. It just doesn't work on a motorcycle. ANy motorcyclist who purchases this product will most likely end up being very dissapointed.Amazon will not let me rate this 0 stars but it has earned it"
3,Not without it's drawbacks,I have used the Rider for one riding season now. While it has come in very handy I have to agree with most of what has been written here.A few comments to save someone some of the aggravation most have experienced. First you will need to upgrade the SD card because the memory in the supplied card is insufficient to operate the unit properly. Without a larger card you will have to deal with freeze ups and reboots. Next go to the TomTom Home page and update the installed software to the latest version. Last of all be sure you have a tether attached to the head unit. When you hit a pothole the unit can detach from the mount.This unit is a great idea but the design is not without flaws.
1,tom tom,"this tom tom did not work out of the box, big problem for me, because I was using this for a cross the countrytrip on a motorcycle. I had to buy a car type which is very hard to use outdoors. Amazon would not refund me the shipping costs."
1,Bike Cradle Problem,"After a relatively few uses, the cradle doesn't make contact with the GPS and your motorcycle power supply won't charge the unit. I have had this happen on 2 units. Since batteries are nearly irreplaceable and limit you to a 4 hour trip, this is a problem. Some web sites say adding solder to the back of your unit may solve the problem, but others don't see it as permanent. This makes it hardly worth the price. I hope TomTom has a solution."
3,"Can we have a little color, please!?","This book was pretty well written, but in the 20th century, we all could use a little color to perk up our days. There was a great amount of pictures. . . A LOT OF PICTURES! But absolutely no color--except for the brilliant cover photo. I guess I'm too materialistic."
5,Road Trip!,"Breaking free after years of living a predictable life, Duane sets off for Montana and a new way of looking at life. Better late than never! For anyone with the urge to set off on a unpredictable journey, pick up this book...you won't be able to put it down."
2,Time has not been good for this book,"In the (four) years since its publication, this book has suffered ""technological attrition"" - Google's search engine has changed significantly enough to make the material unusable, and most of the referenced links are either no longer valid or have ceased further development shortly after 2008."
4,Good read,I read the e edition of this book on my android. Its a very interesting read it kind of shows how dark Google can be when used the right way it can get you into areas your not suppose to be. Even though Google looks very straight forward and simple its really not you will just have to read the book to learn the dark secrets of Google search functions. Very interesting I would recommend this to a friend if any were as geeky as me lol.
4,Seems just right to me,"Unlike the reviewer from Oak Park, I found this DVD to be just the right length and intensity. I have done yoga and Pilates before, so perhaps that makes a difference. However, I am not in very good shape at all. I didn't follow any kind of exercise program while I was pregnant--not even walking! I am now nine weeks postpartum and started using this DVD a week ago.I was afraid when the DVD started that it would move too fast, since the instructor said that people who had used her pregnancy video would be familiar with the moves. I didn't have any trouble following the exercises, though. Some of them are challenging, but I can do them all. I get a nice workout without feeling sore the next day. Best of all, the workout relieves the stiffness I get in my back, arms, and shoulders from carrying my baby all day.All in all, I'm really pleased with this."
2,Disapointed,This was a disappointing experience. I have done Pilates beforeso I already own a couple DVD's . This one said Post Pregnancy . I beg to differ. The two workouts I already own go slower explain more and have variations. And what's with the cheesy music ? I usually buy GAIAM products and I am always happy. Wish I didn't stray from my usual.
5,Owned it for more than 5 years,"I bought this in attempt to get a product that offered a radiant heat function while being quiet and efficient. The best part about this product has to be the height because you can warm more than your feet. Another benefit is the overall design which keeps the light from becoming a distraction like some halogen heaters.At this point I would give it an overall quality rating of 5/5, it's a great product for what it is."
4,Enjoyable short books on Amazon,"I met the author on a train trip last summer. Her sense of humor was great. When I learned she was a published author I searched on Amazon for some of her books. Reading it was just like talking with her on the train. Books are out of publication so I was glad to get them on Amazon at such a LOW, LOW price."
5,"lots of ""a-ha"" moments!",I bought this book for my mom-she does not read but she loved this book! she actually laughed out loud! I also enjoyed reading the book.
1,Description,"Well, i see that it is an helena rubinstein foundation, spectacular. But whats the color of your product???There is no description of that."
5,I have read and experienced,"This book was amazing to me.I was confident and hopeful about Jersey's exorcism as I read her story...but I sensed Beccah was doomed from the start. Greedy and grasping I just knew she wasn't going to have a ""good ending"".Any one who reads this and has experienced real, living darkness in their life that wants you to choose evil will know what I mean. Ultimately you are the exorcist as you cling and cry out to Goodness and Humility.My above comments sound marshmallowy but that is what I feel.Peace"
2,not a well-thought-out book,"This author should have thought twice before publishing this work. I have never read any of his other books, but I had a fairly benevolent impression of him. After reading how gullible, confused and simply old-fashioned he was/is on sexual abuse and the vagaries of the mind, I have lost that impression. He is probably a nice man but needed to do a great deal more self-education relating to his own experience of the ""exorcisms"" before publishing his perspective on them for a modern audience."
1,Exorcism of mental illness,"I for one happen to believe in exorcism and possession, however I am quite certain after reading this book that Mr. Peck performed at least one of these ""exorcisms"" on someone who instead was suffering from severe mental illness.Perhaps he was unable to articulate the situation clearly enough; this is just my opinion from my reading of his account."
2,Big problems,"I am a fan of Scott Peck's work - however there is a problem with this book: he leans on the writings of Malachi Martin. Since the publication of the memoir by Time magazine's Robert Blair Kaiser (""Clerical Error: A True Story"", Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002) there are good reasons to doubt much of what was previously believed to be known about the lifelong liar Malachi Martin, and certainly to be suspicious of his ""factual"" writings (see a useful comment below for more).So as a result ""Glimpses of the Devil"" is a very flawed book."
1,Really bad,"Read the other one star reviews. They are right! Dissappointing, narcissistic, arrogant, and ridiculous. Whether you believe in such things or not this is just plain BAD and does nothing but sound foolish and self-indulgent."
5,Are you afraid to understand evil?,"I found this book fascinating. It recounts two exorcisms by M. Scott Peck. If you are unaware of possession by evil spirits or ambivalent about evil, this will certainly give you more to think about.I found that his descriptions of the exorcisms to be interesting, (not in the way the movie The Exorcist displayed it) but more clinical and analytical. I have also read Hostage to the Devil by Malachi Martin and it is more mysterious in his accounting of the 5 exorcisms. M. Scott Peck actually knew Malachi Martin and this is how he came to understand evil and the fact that people can become possessed by evil.I like that M. Scott Peck is a credible writer and therapist and used his background in psychology to begin his adventure (research) into this area of the human experience. I agree that not all of human experience can be determined through scientific methods and I wonder if there are more writers/therapists out there now that have continued with this theory?"
2,"Very little Exorcism, Too much about Dr. Peck","There is very little about the two exorcisms Dr Peck has preformed. Also, the book is centered entirely around himself and his role in very aspect of theraphy and exorcisms. In the first chapter, Dr Peck explains his often long distance relationship to Malachi Martin- to whom introduced Peck into Exorcism. Although interesting as a start, there is little left.The problem with this book is that he doesn't focus enough on the actual exorcism itself nor the people behind them as much as he should. One patient was molested by her step father and Dr Peck spends little time in the book and with the patient about this occurence. In this instance he wants to blame the victim because she should have known her father wasn;t a real doctor.This is only on example. I really think that anyone interested in exorcism from a relgious or psychological standpoint should not bother with this book."
3,Bleh...,I'm being lenient giving this book a 3 it would actually be more like a 2.5. Good story but overall I think he relied too much on his spiritual/religious beliefs to actually be a good psychiatrist to his patients. Eh.
1,How Terribly Sad...,"How terribly sad that Mr. Peck has become everything he so eloquently preached against in ""The Road Less Traveled."" With the publication of this book it's clear that he has, heartbreakingly, failed to attain the psychological & spiritual growth that he once held so hopeful for humanity. This book speaks to the destructive, soul-destroying power of patriarchal, authoritarian, rigid religious systems & beliefs. He seems to have completely forgotten the fact that ""in order to see evil, we must be evil"" - that we cannot see something in another unless it is within us. After his appearance on the Oprah show several years ago I knew that something was terribly wrong. From ""The Road Less Traveled"" to ""Glimpses of the Devil"" his life is a chilling illustration of the deterioration of the human soul - from the best of humanity to the worst. It almost seems as if he's been possesed..."
2,"maybe, too simple.","This book is good in its own right. Its just not what I was looking for. The author's advice and solutions seemed kind of simple. I like really spiritual books. This seemed too simple.Good self-esteem and taking time for yourself were main concepts.I think, for some people this might be just the thing for them, but not me."
5,Not Just for Black women,"Debrena's audience focus is black women, but almost everything in this well written, entertaining and thought provoking book apply to almost any woman interested in self-improvement. I am very pleased to have added it to my library; having read through it once, I'll now work through the various lessons more slowly and thoughtfully, but I must say I've already begun implementing some of her suggestions and ideas. She has a fresh perspective on a lot of issues, and I've read a LOT of self-help books over the past 25 years!"
5,Make room for more joy!,"This motivational book is packed with many principles that will help you on the road to experience more joy. More joy results in more fun, more life, more time, more money, more peace, and so much more...As you read the principles, your spirit, mind and body will be stimulated and motivated to reach out and take hold of your own joy. Though many of the principles are things we know, the author takes readers beyond our knowledge. She motivates us to study, understand, absorb and LIVE the principles that are applicable to our lives, individually. That's where the joy comes in - when you begin living what you know is best for you.""Make space so that joy has a place"" became my 2001 screensaver and daily reminder to purge and cleanse myself AND my house. You will surely get joy out of reading this wonderful book. It is also a resourceful handbook that you'll want to refer to, often."
5,"Fabulous book for women, artists, spiritual seekers","Yes, this is a self-help book, but it's more than that. It's an adventure into living a richer, more meaningful and fulfilling life. This is a book to buy, tuck into your attache or purse, and read in spare moments to bring color, joy and appreciation back into your daily routine. I cannot possibly praise this book too highly, it is that good."
4,Fun for crash obsessed son,"My son loves crashing into everything with this truck. We had to hide the the figure because my 18 month old daughter was eating his head when she got her hands on him. Only gave 4 stars because the toilet doesn't eject anymore. But overal it's a fun toy for my ""crash into everything"" 4 year old son."
3,Acclimation,This product to acclimate new fish bought in retail or online store. The fish are easier to handle to put in the tank. Will buy this product.
5,The ideal desktop reference,"It's more then the usual printed version of php.net manuals, this book actually give you usable examples along with clear function explanations. The ideal desktop reference for the serious PHP programmer; just not for people that need to learn PHP"
2,This book is out of date,While there is much good information in this book just look at the publication date ***2001*** Enough said... almost. I'm in the 6th week of a PHP/mySQL course and the main thing that is clearly missing are the mysqli functions. The book may still be useful but it is a disappointment :-(
5,Excellent Reference Book,"This book has an excellent easy to use layout and contains just about every PHP function you can imagine. Each function includes a description of the values the function requires and returns along with some sample code showing its usage. It's not for beginners trying to grasp the initial concepts of PHP, for that I'd suggest the PHP Visual Quickstart Guide by Larry Ullman. For anyone else, this is an indispensable reference! It's worth every penny!"
3,Camera accessories,This product was okay for a beginner. Good to learn some effects of lens use. Although I would buy a much better product as I get better at photography.
3,Filters are too small,"The filters are 37mm, the camera requires 58mm. I thought everything in the kit was designed for my Fuji S5200?! Everything else is good though."
1,I haven't recieved it yet..............,"I ordered this dvd at amazon in early Febuary, but I still haven't recieved it...."
2,Ok,"This was a nice look at some of General Hospital, All My Children and One Life to Live's greatest weddings but I was hoping it would be the actual eposides of the weddings instead of just looks at them. With almost every other tv genre putting out complete sets or collection of epsoides I had hoped that's what this DVD would be. I was too young to watch the weddings when they orginially aired (most of them I wasn't even born yet) and hoped this would be a chance to see them."
4,RELEASE A CLASSIC GENERAL HOSPITAL DVD!!!!,"It would be great if classic soap stories would be released. The wedding DVD is great but just not enough. I want some of the back in the day General Hospital to be released. I would love to see classic Monica and Allan,the WSB, Anna, Sonny and Brenda, Robin and Stone...the list goes on. The fans would buy it like hot cakes, especially since the show has become a sad sad joke."
5,"""Age of Regrets"" -- Great Music and Outstanding Lyrics!","Steve Brant and the Phantoms consistently turn out diverse, intelligent, musical recordings and this great collection of new original songs is no exception! The breadth and scope of the subjects keeps up interest from beginning to end. There's a pair of impassioned and reflective songs about the World Trade Center and where we go from here, a ballad of the brave journey of hope made by so many who arrived in a challenging new land by way of Ellis Island, a moving remembrance of the holocaust as it came to a family in Poland, a rockin' dance spoof on parenting an infant, a serious introspective look at one's own parents and oneself... Oh, and there's ""Mild Thing""- ""..."" I'm enjoying this CD immensely and highly recommend it!"
5,Packed with details gardeners will appreciate,"Blue is a rare, sought after color in the gardening world and this provides a review of those hybridized species which provide blue flower. Robert Geneve's Book of Blue Flowers presents over 150 genera whose flowers cover all types of blue hues: while many would be better described as 'purple', some ' as menconopsis horridula - are pure blue. Packed with details gardeners will appreciate."
1,a book of 'blue' flowers? I think not...,"Let me first say that I have the hard-back edition of this book, so if it has been amended in this paperback edition, please disregard this.To be fair, the content of this book is not bad per se. It does have useful & relavant information about all of the species it covers. However, I must give it a poor review based soley on its title: Practically every photograph in this book is of a purple flower. There are only a handful that I would even generously call blue. What's worse is that several of the species, such as Delphinium where I know there are pure blue varieties, are depicted with purple varieties. I can think of several pure blue flowers in the world that are not even mentioned in this book. So, if you purchase this book, prepare to be disappointed."
4,This will be brief..,"...because basically I agree with the reviewers who responded positively to this new musical. I am just surprised to see that only one (I think) mentioned ""Aspects of Love"", for this reminded me more of that show both in melody and atmosphere than any of the other Lloyd-Webber musicals. Although I also heard snatches of his other shows in the music, I think the melancholy nature of the show is what made me think of ""Aspects"", which is, by the way, still my favorite L-W show. To summarize, I liked this album a lot and I would see the show if it came to New York. (Loved the Michael Crawford bonus track at the end, with the audience reaction from opening night)"
5,'Woman in White' is Golden,"If you are a fan of musicals, romance or mystery, you will love this CD. The music is very good, the singing is wonderful and the story is spell-binding. I highly recommend this CD for your enjoyment."
5,Perfect!!!!!,The Woman in White is fantasic! The music is similar to that of the musical The Secret Garden. Angela Christian(AnneCatherick)'s voice is similar to that of Ruthie Henshall(Fantine-Les Mis The Dream Cast in Concert). The performance given by the actors and actresses is phenomenal!The Woman in White will keep you on the edge of your seat and having eager to solve the mystery along with Walter Hartright and Marian Halcombe. If you love gothic musicals and musicals based on classic literature you'll LOVE The Woman in White!!!!!!
4,"Great Show, Great CD !","As soon as I heard a new Andrew Lloyd Webber Musical was going to premiere just before I visited London in September, I had to get tickets. I loved the show. No, it does not quite reach the likes of the Phantom of the Opera or Jesus Christ Superstar but I loved the music and the twist ending. I pre-ordered it as soon it was available on the UK site."
5,One of Andrew's best!,"If you enjoy Andrew Lloyd Weber, then Woman in White is for you. The music and story are great. The cast (including Michael Crawford) sing with tremendous energy."
1,Where is the music???,"From listening to the songs preview I could not find one dissent song like in the other Webber's musicals. He made one of best musicals, Phantom of the Opera"" for which he used a lot of tunes from Puccini, Rimsky-Korsakov and rearranged them beautifully. I think he should have done the same with ""Woman in White"" taking some melodic tunes and rearrange them, or at least ask De Burgh the permission to use the melody of ""Woman in Red"".Please compare how many people left reviews and how many people selling the CD as used.Music is in the eyes of the beholder... but there is a limit."
1,"Pitiful lyrics and score, aimless story and zombie-like performances","Andrew Lloyd Webber has sunk to new lows with this boring adaptation of the novel. The music just goes on and on with tuneless melodies and mock-classic arrangements. The lyrics are just rambling sentences with little rhyme or reason.He hasn't written a good score sense ""Sunset Boulevard."" He needs to find a good lyricist and stop plagarizing Puccini."
1,Bleeargh!!!!,"I am not a ...Sir...Baron... Andrew Lloyd Weber fan, being in the generaly mutually exclusive Sondheim camp. Sure, Evita and Joseph were fine. Phantom was bad, and made worse by the mercifully inimitable Sarah Brightman. But this is drek of a new and rarified nature. The instrumental part rolls, groans, and shifts positions drearily in the background while some bad singers (the only real talent here is Maria Friedman) sing some ""lyrics"" which were evidently written by a five-year-old. This is just about the worst musical which currently exists."
5,Must be heard a second time!,"Give yourself a chance to get used to the melodies. I bought the original cast recording of ""The Woman in White"" because I love ""Phantom"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" and I'm a great admirer of Andrew Lloyd Webber! Well, the first time I listened, I didn't think much of it, but now I'm hooked. I'm humming several tunes all day long, especially ""I Believe My Heart"" and ""All for Laura"". The story, while a bit soapy and melodramatic, is easy to follow, and the voices on this recording are magnificent! I can't wait to see this show on stage!"
4,"Actually, this book is quite good","Blame it on my European origin, but it was pleasing, like a change of the landscape, to read most of the essays. Even though I do consider myself a feminist, I was glad to finally find a modern academic book which doesn't share the pretentious and dry obsession about gender!The style is fluid, with many anecdotes. Of course, one could argue that it is sometimes too easy-going or not focused enough, but it is a recommendable introduction."
5,Interesting and enlightening,"As a spinner/weaver I am very interested in women in history and what their traditional roles were and WHY. This book was a great experience and gave me a lot of information on many subjects, not just the spinning/weaving I was seeking. It's fascinating to read about our traditional (and sometimes non-traditional) roles were in the creation of the lives we live today. I hate to say that all women should read this book because that seems trite but, guess what? They should. Sometimes you have to know where you came from to figure out where you are going."
3,"The jeans are fine, but the seller is flaky","I bought these for my boyfriend and they did look nice and fit true to size; his only criticism was that the pockets were sewn with the same ""fleece"" used to line the jeans, which seemed too flimsy to hold keys and other items that would normally be carried in work pants. My main problem was the seller; I ordered a similar jean with a red fleece lining twice, only to have them not arrive; when I checked the status of the order they were scheduled to arrive in six or eight weeks (by which time the weather would have been too warm to need them). I think if the seller is out of stock they should say so instead of just delaying your shipment."
5,i live by the book.,"i honestly do live by this book, and its prequel, ""how it all vegan"". almost everything i cook has come from these books, or is an altered version of something from one of the books. they're fun, they're hip, they're health- and animal-conscious. sarah and tanya are two of the most compassionate, vibrant vegans you'll ever find anywhere. this book even contains tips for the starving college kid living in a dorm room!"
3,Decent basic cookbook,"Good things about this cookbook:* Cheap, easy, fast recipes* Contains quite a few recipes that I return toBad things:* Many repeats from How it All Vegan!* The index is not terribly user-friendly* Many recipes are bland or just plain odd. I use them as starting points, and add my own ingredients from thereOverall, I use this and How it All Vegan! enough to keep them around, especially as I fill them up with my comments and additions. I have four vegan cookbooks, and I use the two by Kramer and Barnard about 1/4 of the time."
3,Better Books Out There,"I've had this book in my collection for awhile, but haven't reviewed it yet. I guess that's because I rarely use it, but I pulled it out the other day looking for something ""new"" to make for dinner, and was reminded why I use it as little as I do.I don't think it's a horrible book by any means, but there are much better all purpose vegan cookbooks out there. A lot of the recipes are very simple, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but there's a lot of recipes, that I don't really think a recipe is required for. And all of the recipes I've tried have turned out well, but nothing that left me thinking that I needed to make it again.Some nice additions are an extensive FAQ, more uses for baking soda then I ever needed to know, and party ideas. I would however, rather see some food photos then as many photographs of the authors that were included. I don't mind a personal picture here or there, but it is a cookbook after all!"
5,Great everyday cookbook,"This is a great weekday cookbook, to turn to when you want that quick vegan meal, with alot of flavor and few-ish ingredients. I have given this to so many friends because it's all about the flavors, if you have broccoli instead of cauliflower, it really doesn't matter much. They keep it simple."
5,Funny? Yes. Also meaningful.,"This book *is* very very funny, but I think by the reviews I've read, people are missing the point. The Happy Hocky Family is happy - regardless. No matter what life throws at them, they always face it with optimism. So what if your favorite caterpillar turns into a butterfly and escapes? You still have the cool jar, right? Buy the book to laugh, but learn the lesson of the Hockys. Be happy - regardless. Life is too tragic to let the little things slip by unappreciated."
3,Good but EXPENSIVE!,"I really like the way this product makes you feel after use. The downside is that the bellow on the side of the bottle is SO effective, that the solution comes out with the force of a fire hose. One huge whoosh and a third of the bottle is gone. I suppose that I may eventually learn the precise touch needed, but at the moment learning to play the French horn seems more attainable. I think I may order one refill and see how quickly that blasts out of El Machino, but sinus cleansing with Saltaire at this time is a luxury I don't know if I can afford."
5,Beauitful Brandy Glasses,I just got these beauitful brandy glasses yesterday. They are just beauitful to set out for my guest. I really do like them so muched. They are just beauitful.
3,Good only because it was about Judy,"I read this book and thought, these people didn't have a clue. I'm glad people want to remember the positive parts about Judy. I think the positive parts out-shined the good parts. But, at the same time Judy was not an angel. Judy was a full human being with both good and bad parts of her life and her story."
5,Judy - Shattered,"Got this book from Santa and he sure knows how to pick'em. I love it. I sat down with it Christmas Eve at midnight and next thing I knew, it was 2 am Christmas morning. Everyone has been looking at it since it sits out in our den...at least when I am not looking at it. Judy Garland - my all-time favorite. What an artist, what a tragedy that she is gone from us. But this book makes you live Judy again. The focus is on her younger, beautiful days. The photos are just fantastic and the text is detailed, but easy to follow. The author doesn't wrap her or anyone else's thoughts around a hundred extra words just to prove they have a vocabulary. The author is intent on shattering manyof the myths associated with Judy and presents many facts and quotes in doing so. Very upbeat. A pleasant journey through Judy's life that she doesn't often get!"
3,Now what?,"I never thought I would say this but the book is in desperate need of one or two more ... well ... sex scenes. I read it, I liked it (Kresley Cole knows how to write well and spin a story even better) but at the end I felt that s/thing was missing. And going back to ""If you Dare"", a wonderful read in my opinion, I understood what it was. Sex, ladies and gents.Kresley Cole, together with Emma Holly, are the two writers who really know how to write a sex scene without giving the feeling that is a cold act. I missed that in this book. I really did <:("
3,If you Desire,"Just a quick read, not as good as her other books. Somehow you get into buying the 3 books just to see what happens in the end."
3,Part of Trilogy,This book is part of the trilogy. Story ok but can get explicit. Not for tweens or your teen girls.
3,Better then the first,"I'm reading this series only because its Kresley Cole and I love her paranormal romance series ""Immortals After Dark"", I like history so I thought these would be alright and they are, but they are not wonderful and not anything like her other books.This one is about the second Scottish brother and his frilly little English women who he has to marry in order to protect her from a highly skilled assassin. It's of no trouble really considering he has had it for the girl since she was 15 and now in his early 30's he is more than happy to make things more serious. She is a funny character, smart, and witty. He is charming, brutal, and sweet when he needs to be.Not allot more to say, the romance is good, the story line alright. In the end they live happy ever after."
5,Amazing,Part 2 was just as amazing as part 1. What skills to write a story. You're hooked from the very beginning
4,"slow to start, quick to finish!","Another great book by Kresley Cole! I was a bit worried about not liking the leading lady at first, but as always, you love all the characters once you get to know them. Not my favorite book from the MacCarrick trilogy, but it's well worth the purchase."
4,"good story, great characters....","read all three of this series in two days - which should give you an idea as to whether I liked them! I do like me some strong, almost scary heroes, and loathe when they're paired with simpering wusses. not the case in this book. maddy is strong, clever and funny - a perfect foil for the tortured, scarred and sexy hero. good romance, good writing, great characters."
4,Perfect beach read,"Like the first book in the series, I read this in less than 24 hours - couldn't put it down. Another fun, fast read!"
5,MacCarrick Brothers Trilogy,I really enjoyed this series. I was looking for a new series to get into and I found it in Kresley cole. She is a brilliant author that kept me entertained throughout the entire series. There wasn't a dull moment to be had in all three books.
2,Not so much.,"I really didn't like this book at all. Just not enough passion and love scenes between the hero and heroine, the story was really slow, and the heroine was hard to like. If you want a great read ""If you decieve"" Ethan's story is the best of the series."
5,If You Desire,"Great book!! Hugh has loved Jane for over ten years but refuses to act on his love because he believes he and his brothers are cursed to be loveless and alone. Jane has loved Hugh for just as long but has just decided he's never going to love or marry her so she decides to accept another proposal. What Jane doesn't know is Hugh works for her father who dispatches assasins to kill traitors to the crown and one of her fathers men has decided to get revenge by killing Jane. Hugh arrives on the scene after an urgent message to find the woman he loves in danger from a mad man and almost engaged. I really liked the interaction between these two you could practically feel Jane's frustration with Hugh for not giving into his feelings. Great plot, fun story and wonderful characters it's a keeper for me!!"
3,not the best of the MacCarrick Bro's series,"I majorly love Kresley Cole as an author, and I especially love the MacCarrick brothers. Court (from If You Dare) is delicious, and surprisingly, Ethan (from If You Decieve) is to die for! Ethan's story is the best of the three, though at first you think Ethan is the brother you'll like the least. Before reading his story, I thought Hugh would be my favorite of the brothers - quiet, stoic, and devoted to Jane. But this is not a good read. The story is a bit slow, and Hugh is so completely tied up with emotion to the point where he almost can't function. Also, Jane comes across as almost a contemporary woman, I had a little trouble placing her into the context of the times. But toward the end, the story picks up. And it's hard not to love these brothers!"
3,Weak link in the series,"This book could have been good, but it wasn't. I think the main problem was the hero, Hugh. I loved him in 'If You Dare' and 'If You Deceive', but in his own story, I felt like slapping him for his foolishness just like the heroine did. Speaking of the heroine...she was hard to like as well. She led such a shallow existance, with very few redeeming qualities.I would recommend the book simply to connect the two stronger books (which I loved!) in the series."
1,Possibly acceptable on the beach with a beverage,"It takes far too many chapters to get to the heart of this story. There is way too much back story, and not enough action and ""interaction."" It's obviously evocative of ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" but Cole should have stuck closer to the proven plot winner. I easily skipped whole chapters without losing track of the convoluted story.This is a dubious purchase, possibly acceptable on the beach with a frosty beverage.Since I already ordered No. 3, I hope it's a better book, although Ethan and his ""little French blonde"" don't sound like a fun couple.Note to the author and her publisher: Slow down your fast-paced publication schedule & take more time with your writing--and proofreading. It's ""risque,"" not ""risky,"" ""they're"" not ""there's"" in many places, and ""none is"" not ""none are.""Romance readers are the best and deserve better."
5,Great Pan,"This is a terrific buy! The pan is solid and heavy-duty! My mom totally loved it. When I get a bigger oven (mine is a small wall oven), I will be buying these pans!"
4,A treat for the fanatics!!,"How in God's name did the major label that owned these masters justify dumping them at an auction?Well,who knows.But here is a great companion to the ""20th Century ...""Box set import,because this has tons of alternate takes and unedited endings/jams from the Slider-ish era that should have been presented on that box!A bit pricy,but a must have for ""the freaks""!"
3,Arrived Broken and disappointed!!,"I purchased this from Amazon and a wheel kit from Homier. The generator arrived first and the box appeared undamaged so it sat until the wheel kit arrived. When I started putting on the wheel kit I noticed the case on the generator was broken and one mount broke so I contacted Amazon. Well it appeared they didn't have anymore in stock so I agreed to a partial refund and would replace the case myself(I'm a mechanic). Well after locating parts and getting them, I repaired the case. I started to add gas and found the fuel tank leaked, apparently hit by the loose engine. I contacted Amazon again but since so much time had passed I couldn't get a refund. The operator(from India I think) gave me a $10. gift certificate. WOW, $10. !!!!!!Fortunately they are out of stock so no one else can order any but if you get one elsewhere, please open the box immediately and inspect EVERYTHING!!VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!http://www.mopar1.us/ebay/gen1.jpghttp://www.mopar1.us/ebay/gen3.jpg"
2,"The usual problems apparently, but with a bad new twist","I too received a generator with shttered mounts in an otherwise un-damaged box. Oddly, I am told becuse the generator is hazardous I cannot return it through normal routes, and Amazon will contact me with a resolution. For now, until they get this issue resolved, I would suggest waiting on this. It seems to be a constant issue that would be EASILY preventable by the insertion of styrofoam blocks inside to support the generator while its in transit. The shear weight of the motor and dynamo overwhelm the mounts and in my case, the actual motor itself cracked and tore free. This is a simple case of trying to save 4$ on foam, and I guarantee that more than that has been wasted on return postage.Dont buy until I post an update that Amazon has remedied its ""you cant return this, its hazardous material"" issue."
3,Generator review,"It came with some issues. There were some broken pieces. The electrical box was broken. The choke was broken. Both plastic pieces that appeared to be either broken during shipment or more likely during production. The pieces seemed to be on too tight, and therefore, broke the plastic. The generator runs fine. It runs my satellite & TV for my tailgate and has more power available. I haven't hooked anything up that requires a lot of power to see how it handles it. All-in-all, for the value, it was a good buy, but if you don't want to put a little work into getting it ready to run, don't bother. I'm not sure how well these are constructed."
4,Excellent,Excellent generator. It is easy to turn on not very noisy and extremely dependable. I use it as a back up for my fridge and some power tools and would recommend it. Its not too big and fairly easy to move.It has a run time of about a day and half. I think its one of the best on the market. I paid about 275.00. I think its one of the best deals out there for under $300 I dont think you can go wrong.
4,Adequate Generator at Great Price,"I've run it twice now. It was purchased as an emergency power source for my sump pump and a couple space heaters. Virtually no setup (except for wheel kit which isn't mandatory); just add oil and gas and pull the starter. Started first try each time. Workmanship isn't top of the line: oil dipstick stripped itself first time screwing it back in, choke lever flimsy, etc. But I'm happy for what I paid. It will definitely get me through the next few years as I plan to take good care of it to avoid any problems that could arise from non-use."
4,Good Deal,I got this generator today and it run's great. I couldn't believe it started on the first pull and is a smooth quiet motor. As with all china made generators be sure and tighten all the fastners and loctite if possible.( I own a china ATV and motorcycle.) I'm a locksmith and it runs all my key machines and power tools. I also will be using it for my ac in my camper. It's not to shabby at all. (4/24/08) Ran 6000 btu AC in camper for 10 hours on one tank of fuel .....Love This Generator. As of 5/9/08 using it everyday and is still the same as new ....amazing.
5,Perfect generator for home use,"If you want an affordable genset with a good power rating, this item is the perfect choice. Prior to making my purchase, I was guided by the positive feedbacks of other buyers. Now that I have the unit, it has performed beyond my expectations. Made in China, its build quality is good. My unit arrived in perfect shape, although the carton box was in rough shape. Once I put in the crankcase oil, it fired up immediately. I have used it around the home for about 10 hours now and it looks like its going to give me many years of reliable service."
4,Product is good Shipping problems,"As with many others that reviewed this product, I received my generator in a timley fashion, but there was some slight damage during shipping. The plastic air filter housing was broken by being pushed in. I sent a request through Amazon, for a replacement. I got a reply from the distributor saying the part was being shipped, but I have not yet received it. Anyway, the reply was prompt. The generator was all I expected it to be. I added oil and gas to the motor, and pulled a few times, and the engine started right up. It ran pretty quitely. I then plugged in a heavy duty leaf blower, and the power output was good."
1,Buyer beware!,I bought this generator from Amazon & it was shipped by Homier. It was damaged & Homier sent the replacement casting. Then it did not create any electricity. I called Homier & they sent a part that they assured me would repair it. It did not. Now they do not answer calls. You leave a message & nobody returns the call. Steer clear of this product! There are better options. I can't find parts anywhere.
4,Great Little Generator!,"I've had this since 2008, when I bought it to run my sump pump in the event of a power outage. I run it once a month to keep everything clean, and just changed the oil for the first time. It kept things going during Irene, the recent NE snowstorm, and a recent 8 hour power failure. Reliable, but a bit noisy, but when I have it running at night, I want to be able to hear it so I know it is still working. If you don't have a generator and you have a basement that could flood, without at least a battery backup, you are a fool. Get one of these, or something like it."
3,Returned because of broken motor mounts,I return this generator because of 3 reasons. 1. I've found the motor mount has broken. 2. The pictures in user's manual are not this generator. 3. It is just a 2600 Watt generator.
4,First pull!,"I am very pleased with this purchase. The generator arrived on time and without any damage. Once I attached the wheel kit, (a royal pain - not difficult but the instructions leave much to be desired), added oil and gas, the engine started on the first pull."
4,Great price/Great seller/average product.,"Can't beat the price. Homier was very accomodating as the wheel kit was defective. They sent me a new one without having me send the original one back. The generator starts easy and runs smooth, but not after fixing the choke lever. It was installed wrong and I had to remove the air cleaner and adjust it so the lever would open and close the choke. I would have broke the lever if I forced it(cheap plastic choke lever). Also the direction labels peeled off right away(choke and fuel valve). So, you can see where they cut corners on the little things. I am hoping they didn't cut corners with the engine and generator. Documentation is pretty useless."
1,Can't even start it up!,"I followed the instructions in the book: 1) oil - check 2) gas - check 3) turn switch on - check 4) turn gas stopcock to on - check 5) instructions say cold start leave choke closed - check.Not sure if I am supposed to have the circuit breaker pointer to ON but I did because it makes sense.6) Pulled and pulled and pulled but it won't start. Occasionally there is a loud snap. But it never starts.What's the secret to getting it going? If you know, please email me at mjburkett@hotmail.com. THANKS!"
1,This Product Still Arrives Damaged,"I read the other reviews, but ordered it anyway since my county had declared a state of emergency and 90% of electric customers were without power. I needed it fast, and I needed to use it right away. It was worse than everyone said. All the plastic underneath the rollbar was shattered and the roll bar itself was crushed in. I returned it (and it took over 10 days for UPS to come pick it up). Luckily the power came back on the day after I ordered it."
1,wouldnt suggest buying,Mine ran for 10 minutes never to run again. Amazon was great thouh and returned it. Now looking for a real brand.
4,so far so good,havent really used yet. I did start it once I took it out the box. It started right up. I'm looking forward to using it in the future
3,Gas tanks leaks,Good value for a generator. Easy start. I bought the generator to run our travel trailer and it does a good job including the A/C unit. My problem with it is that the gas tank lid does not seal as tight as it should and gas splashes out on bumpy mountain roads. Thus the 3 start rating.
4,great generator but horrible instruction,"i got this generator few days ago, i'm having problem with the engine sputtering, more specifically the choke lever. i called the manufacture and homier and can not get a respond. it looks like a good generator; i don't want to send it back to amazon.if you don't mind, can i e-mail you few questions? if you got it to work, please e-mail me at buckyball@netzero.net. thanks in advance-bruce"
5,Wow. Blue Max runs great.,"My family and I, ( all 12 of us ) camped at Badin Lake for a week and this Generator handled everything we threw at it, and it was great on fuel. As far as the noise level, I would say that My Genny was about like a push mower running in place, Tolerable. Putting it together was no problem and took only about 5 min. two pulls ang she was running. DON""T FORGET THE OIL. 8 oz. no more , no less.Thanks and God Bless, Rob."
2,Haven't run it yet because of broken motor mounts.,"I ordered the generator, it arrived in a timely fashion. Package looked good, Fedex guy unpacked it with me and it looked great. It was not until I went to install the wheel kit that my wife noticed a broken motor mount. Amazon quickly sent me a different one and yesterday the replacement arrived. I looked it over real closely and this one also had a broken motor mount. They are made of aluminum and the generators are probably being set down too hard, The thin aluminum can't handle the shock, which is odd since the generator should vibrate from running. Anyway, Amazon has said they would have it picked up and issue a refund since it is a reoccuring thing. I just want them to send me a non-defective generator, so I can have backup power this summer if needed."
3,Very hard starting,"My Blue Max 4000 generator is almost impossible to start. 20 or more pulls when cold, 15 when warm. Oil is full, gas is fresh, generator is brand new! Three stars because of this plus the banged up packaging and gas gauge which doesn't work. On the other hand, once it is running, it does what it is supposed to do, and does so quietly. I have another smaller Blue Max generator (1000 watt) which is also impossible to start. Frustrated and disappointed in the product even for the low price."
3,More Book than there was to fill it,"Read it from the library, decided not to add it to my collection. Not strong enough on info to keep as reference. Okay for casual reading if you haven't heard about this before."
4,Only in New York,I bought this book for a friend of mine who loves NYC trivia and is changing careers to become a NYC tour guide. She loves this book and has already used some of the information on some tours that she is in training for. Easy to read and very interesting informtaion.
1,No Faith In Man,poor and inaccuratedistateful and poorly writtenalmost boringvoyueristic and misleading
5,Plight of the U.S. middle class,"The panel Charlie interviews offered a clear view on what caused the current plight of the middle class. Their take is that rise of economic competitors around the world, combined with a growing wealth inequality and oligarchical political control of the country by the wealthiest Americans over the last thirty years has paralyzed our political process to point where no consensus to increase the investment in the manufacturing, physical infrastructure and education that will be necessary to restore the American middle class can currently be reached."
5,"Magnificient, thought-provoking photos","This is a beautiful book with wonderful, thought-provoking photos of weeping women, gladdened women, resting women, all kinds of women mourning a loved one. The essays by the author and by Joyce Carol Oates clarify the mystery of the sculptures and why they explain more about the living than about the dead. These photos were all taken in European cemeteries. Surely there must be a comparable book for the U.S. This one is well worth the price; it is truly exquisite."
3,beautiful photos,This small book has very beautiful photographs of very emotional sculptures on graves but not much text to tell you about them.
3,I would like to give it more stars...,"I bought this after buying ""Beautiful Death"" because I loved the photos so much. Unfortunately, this book was not as well put together. It's smaller (which I hate small photography books!) and most of the photos are in black & white, but are not very striking. I'm not sure if the photographer intended for the photos to be so gray or if that's the fault of the publisher. When I purchased this I was hoping to get more of the large, colored photos that were in Beautiful Death--many of the photos in this book are lovely, but the presentation of them sadly detracts from the beauty."
3,Works great as long as the blade stays in!,"This jigsaw works fine, except for on very important glitch. When using the wood blade included in the package, the blade constantly pops out, no matter how thick,or thin the material you are cutting.I made a mistake and did not use this saw until well after the time allowed for returns. If not I would have returned it immediatley. My recommendation is to not buy a jigsaw with this ""quick clamp"" option. Get one that requires you to screw the blade tight.My attempts to contact Black and Decker about this problem met with less than spectacular results. This purchase was a waste of money."
1,Black & Decker tool user,"I have used Black & Decker Power tools all my life. So when I purchased this jig-saw, I was surprised by the poor quality of parts used. For example there was a platic clamp used to hold the blade. It worked for a couple of days then it started releasing the blade. I will not purchase any more tools with B&D name on them."
1,doesn't hold the blade,"I had the same experience as the other reviewers. The clamp can't hold a blade in. It has gotten worse over time, and now it's at the point where the instant the blade touches the wood, it falls out. The saw is completely unusable."
4,beautiful,"The bowl was beautiful and the shipping was fast an easy. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because this was a wedding gift, and I would have ultimately liked to ship it directly to the newlyweds, but this option was not available. That being said, I am planning on getting the salad bowl set in this style for myself."
4,This book was a joy and an inspiration for worship.,We have used this book as a resource for our worship and it is so appropriately titled. The love that it displays to the people in our congregation is wonderful. The words fit even when we had special occasions like Men's Day or Youth Sundays. I feel truly blessed to have discovered this resource because it makes my job of doing the weekly bulletin so fulfilling as I read the words for our weekly service. I am looking forward to next year's edition.
5,A must see if you love the Beatles,All i can say is buy this and enjoy the humor of the group and the live tv performances on all of the Ed Sullivan shows and the sound is pretty damn good.
2,Expanded Newspaper Articles,"This manages to make Dahmer's macabre story boring by stiffly recounting the tale in chronological fashion. The writer, a cop's wife and a Milwaukee newspaper reporter who was first on the scene, doesn't really have the skill to write a full length book. She needed a ghost writer to make the facts come alive. It reads like a long and dull newspaper article. With so many better accounts on the market, don't bother with this one."
1,A poor telling of Dahmer's story,"I would not recommend this book at all. It seems to me that this author used the book to brag that she's married to a cop and has an inside scoop on everything instead of using it to tell us the story of Dahmer. I have read many Dahmer books from different points of view and this one was my least favorite. I guess it's worth a read but be warned, it isn't the greatest Dahmer book there is."
1,I'm just sayin'...,"... that this book was a total waste of time, for those of us who enjoy a GOOD story telling. Shocking that such an interesting story could become so boring in this author's hands.Never again..."
2,My Heart is Still Beating Just Fine,"I swore after I read Fielding's prior - about a wife on the run and hiding in Ohio, I think - that I would never waste time on her again. Well, too bad I didn't recall my oath. ""Heartstopper"" is a serial killer type novel which drags on and on, with needless loose dialogue and very little suspense. A family relocates from upper NY to Florida when the dad has an online affair. The premise is weak and the wronged wife is even weaker. The students she teaches are all sterotypes and not worth a second look. I easily put down this book and only finished it by skimming. I figured out fairly easily half way through (in spite of obvious 'clues' to mislead the reader) who the killer was and I hate that. I do NOT want to figure out who done it. So many better writers out there, that I am sorry to say Joy Fielding must be resting on her earlier laurels. A shame. She is totally boring. I do believe I could write this book and that is not a compliment. Avoid it at all costs."
4,"Predictable, but good","Within the first few chapters I figured out who the killer was. Still, ""Heartstopper"" was a pageturner. For sure a good Summer beach read."
3,"Good, not great.","After reading some of Joy Fielding's books, this one is good but not great. It is a page-turner but somewhat predictable whereas some of Fielding's book have left me clueless until the very last page. I recommend it but not as good as ""See Jane Run"" which I thought was excellent or ""Whispers and Lies"" which was probably the best book I've ever read in the genre of mystery/suspense."
3,Not one of Joy Fielding's best works...,"I don't like reviews that give away too much of the story, so will only stick with my opinion here. This is, to me, Joy Fielding's worst novel ever. Filled with enough references to teen idols to make a reader of Okgurgle with happiness, it seemed as if it was written in 60 days--or less.Many writers get better as they mature it appears, as has been the case with John Saul and Tess Gerritsen (though Dean Koontz has stayed the same, superb...while Stephen King has gotten worse). Joy Fielding is not one of those writers, and I am saddened about this as she used to be one of my top 5 favorites. Perhaps next time she'll put out a better product."
4,"Good, fast fun","Fielding does a good job with her characters, better than the average thriller writer. And this book is no exception. The characters are believable and richly drawn.This time, Fielding sets her story in a small Florida town. A journal written by a serial killer alternates with glimpses of the people in the town. The central characters include a teacher whose husband has left her for a younger Barbie clone, and her two high school age children.But who is the serial killer? Fielding heightens suspense until all is revealed at the end."
2,Read the book,"I am reviewing the MP3 audio version of this book. Unfortunately, I couldn't get beyond the 4th chapter of this book due to the narrator's (Judith West) interpretation of the various characters. They were terrible. I will eventually read this in print form as I am a real fan of Ms Fielding's novels. But when I found myself 'tsk'ing and rolling my eyes with each overly-emoted word coming out of the speakers, I decided I didn't need to waste my time this way - I have other audiobooks."
4,Heartstopper,Great book. At last Joy Fielding has returned to her psychological thrillers which I read and loved years ago. A good one for her fans.
1,Mindnumbing,"I have to agree with most of the negative reviews. Though I won't give away the ending, and I admit I did keep reading to see whether I was right, I figured out whodunnit by about the second or third chapter. It seemed to me like Ms. Fielding honestly felt that the revelation would be a huge shocker to her readers.If you enjoy Danielle Steel's cliched and hackneyed writing style, you might enjoy this book. If you're the cynical type who thinks there aren't any honest, upstanding, good guys out there, you might enjoy the male characters in this book. If you enjoy alliterations, you might enjoy the many samples of it in this book - and you'll enjoy the way each and every sample is pointed out as such.As for myself, I think I'd rather read a riveting railroad schedule that recommend this revolting book to anyone."
3,Almost Complete B-Sides Collection,"I gave this 3 stars based on the price. It has most of the B-sides from the singles but leaves out 'Alien Boy' from the UK version of Jenny and 'Polish Mule' from the UK version of Jo Jo's. It does however have everything from Discretion Grove and Phantasies EP. You should pick up the UK Jo Jo's just for the video, it's funny. The only song that's exclusive to this release is the live version of Pink India. Completists still will need Jo Jo's Jacket and the other version of Jenny & The Ess-Dog, but if you havent got Phantasies or Discretion Grove this is a good way to get em all in one."
5,Atlantis the Lost Continent,"What seems to be the problem with the North American release of this DVD on US format Region 1. Since I have not yet seen a box set release of George Pal films I am starting to think that there must be some kind of a prejudice against him as a producer. Atlantis the Lost Continent, is a fine fantasy film in its own right, suitable to stand against any such films of this period such as the 7th Voyage of Sinbad or Mysterious Island. Although these two films are not George Pal films, let us not forget the class films that are, such as War of Worlds (1952), The Time Machine and Destination Moon. If you want to spend a few hours of old time fantasy fun with decent special effects for both yourself and your children then I suggest that the general public push for the release of this classic in the near future.In Waiting:Robert A. Glover"
2,Used book with too much highlighting,The book was used but there was no mention of the condition pertaining to the amount of highlighting that had been done in the book. This made the book almost impossible to use.
5,Gee Whiz...!,"This is a terrific ""Gee whiz...!"" book - full of fun items that stimulate your thinking while illustrating and explaining challenging concepts.So, how many times CAN you fold a standard sheet of binder paper in half? Try inflicting this on your friends and colleagues, and enjoy the results! [If you have not read the book, try this: guess an answer to the question, then grab a sheet of 8.5 x 11 paper and try it out. You may be surprised...]Great book - highly recommended for those who enjoy learning."
1,The unenlightened,"The authors try to use math and logic to explain coincidences, which is of a realm that math nor logic can always explain. There are other types of intelligences that the logical (rational) mind have no authority or insight in trying to explain. The authors also attributes traits of the conscious mind to intuition and either confuses the two or disguises the logical mind as intuition . Their arguments are like symbolic logic used by lawyers, which are designed to be ambiguous, unless you are wise enough to detect their deceitfulness or naivety or unenlightenment whether deliberate or unwittingly.I love math and I did well in it, but I am also a creative person. The creative/intuitive and the rational/logical sides of our brains have to work in unison. One is not more important than the other. They each have their own functions. Using either of them in their extremes can be detrimental to the person's overall health (mental, physical, psychological, emotional.)"
1,This Is NOT a movie & I want a REFUND!,"This is not a movie! This is a very poorly done video of a speaker giving a workshop. The videography is of very poor quality, and the speaker is not very engaging on his topic. This should not be listed as a ""MOVIE"". It is not even a documentary. I have seen powerpoint presentations that are more interesting than this speaker. I had to give this at least one star, because ZERO is not offered as an option. Seriously, it is not worth watching for free! I will certaily ask for my money back!"
5,solid poker set,very nice set- heavy as can be so I was happy to get it through Amazon with free shipping!
4,Worth the chips,"Bought it for husband's birthday party poker night fro $41. Was delivered in 2 days and he loved it. He said the cards were Bee brand and were regulation. The chips were nice weight and feel, they had some small imperfections on maybe 20 chips and they had some little burrs that flaked off quite easily after handling, but all in all a solid set. Compared to my brothers set (identical but bought for $99 and had dice) you can tell the difference in the case liner and handle only. This set has a chrome colored plastic handle, the more expensive one has a thicker felt liner and a metal handle. Chips are the same though. Enjoy!"
3,"Fair Quality, Excellent Value","The set was received on time. As described the set is very extensive and of great value for the money. However, some of the chips have chipped after minimal handling. I don't think this set will look as good as it does today in a few years. Maybe a plastic chip set would be a better purchase"
3,Looks okay,"When it arrived to my home, the outside box was damaged; the poker case was dented as well. Otherwise, it looks okay - my boyfriend hasn't used it yet."
4,great poker chip set,"This 500 chip set it ideal for home games of up to 10 players.The chip weight is great and quality is good. Some chips have a small nub remaining from the manufacturing process, but if they bother you, they're easy to remove. The edge striping is a nice feature not found in similar discounted sets, but the white chips with blue stripes are easy to mix up with the blue chips with white stripes when they are stacked.The playing cards that come with the set are not of very high quality and get creased quite easily. I bought new cards after only one night of playing with them.The overall weight of the set is shocking, which is why shipping charges for comparable sets is typically more than the cost of the set itself. Amazon super saver shipping was the key factor in my decision to get this set over similar sets from other discount poker Web sites."
2,Do this set really deserve 4 1/2 stars?,"I wanted to get real clay chips but most sellers do not ship to APO address or shipping cost was very expensive. So, I decided to get this from Amazon w/ free shipping. Overall rating was great so I thought it would be the right choice. I don't really understand how this item was rated as 4 stars. Poor quality chips and decks, dusty. It is very light and made of chip plastic. Some people might say ""what do you expect for $36?"" but I just want to let you know this is not the one you need if you are looking for casino quality poker chips."
2,Good price but must have been a reason,"Got a good price during the Christmas deals but must have been because these were sitting in a warehouse for years or something. The chips were wrapped in plastic in rows, then in the case, then in a box and somehow were very dirty. Not sure if these were returned or some kind of display model but I don't see how the inside of a case which is inside of a box can acquire so much dirt."
3,I guess it's ok for the price,"First thing I noticed was how heavy it was which seems to be a good thing.Second thing I noticed was how the aluminum case feels like plastic with aluminum accents. The case is extremely disappointing. Slightly concerned about the durability considering the weigh it's containing.The chips have a few flaws, but seem fine for home use. Some other reviews mention problems with the colors on the sides of the chips. I either don't see the same issue or I received a different set."
4,Good Quality,This is a complete set and is very good quality. My husband was very happy with it and it shipped fast
4,worth it,"the outer box is not very strong, so u can not lift this thing with handle but overall its value for money."
5,Outstanding! Very Satisfied.,"I ordered this product with a bit of hesitation given the feedback from other buyers, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and condition of the product. I am confident that future buyers will be satisfied with this product."
4,As advertized...,This seems like a decent set of chips and case...No damage during shipping...Heavier than I was expecting...$34.00 with free 2-day prime shipping...
4,ok for the money,"after receiving the product, i can see where all those previous reviews come from, both the good ones and the bad ones.ok, first off, it's 35 bucks for 500 chips. for that money, you are not getting the casino chips.now w/ that said, the chips are really synthetic clay material. it does give you the ""klungk"" feel that the cheap walmart chips don't have.but the polishing could have been better. as one of the earlier reviewer said, the edges are a little rough. not so sharp it cuts you, but definite could have been better.worst of all though, is the two decks of cards that come along. they are almost as thin and as soft as my printer paper. be ready to get your own deck of cards.so overall, give it a 4 star. worth what the money is."
3,"Crappy quality, but great for its price","500 chips, a case, 2 decks of cards, and buttons for forty dollars? Pretty good. Too bad everything is below average quality. The chips are peeling and they're extremely dirty (although I'm told this is to be expected by friends who have their own sets). The case is nice on the outside, especially with the three locks, but on the inside it is complete crap. The little box where you put your chips is not connected to the case so you could easily take it outside (which also makes it insecure and easily lost), and the styrofoam padding on the top is loose as well. If you don't mind any of this, then go ahead and buy it."
4,Love it,I absolutely love this kit. The chips are great and feel like the real ones; the only downside is that the kit is sort of heavy.
4,great and portable,"durable, distinct colors. feel professional . very sturdy and dependable carrying case. would recommend for that home or traveling poker game."
2,OK buy for the chips ONLY.......case is garbage,"Chips are OK.....case is a complete piece of garbage.If you buy this set...you are buying it for the chips, and that is about it.Card/buttons/case arent worth buying."
5,Great Buy for the money!!,"I recently played poker with the girls for our usual last Friday of the month girls game night. The poker game we played was so much fun, I wanted my own set of poker chips. My friend had a great set of poker chips she bought for a gift for her husband. I went ""shopping"" on Amazon's web site. I saw this ""Fat Cat"" poker set for $37.75 and it looked very much like the set we had used. I ordered the set and was very surprised when it was delivered. The chips are great quality and made of clay.....very nice sturdy case and rather heavy in weight. The box was packed within a box with plenty of packing around the case. I would highly recommend this set."
4,Good Chips,The case is not lockable but the chips are good. It has evreything you need in order to play poker.
2,Dented Poker Chip Set,"The item, which is supposed to be a gift, arrived with major dents all over the case and broken pieces of the case on the inside. Now I am stuck giving my boyfriend this janky cheap looking gift for Valentine's day. I don't have the time nor do I feel I should have to expend the energy to pack this back up (spend $ on another gift in the meantime) and return it. If you read some other reviews, someone else mentions this same problem. Don't place your hopes on this one, it's not worth the purchase from this vendor. Sorry."
3,Just OK,Chips don't have denominations on them. They are colored but since I am color blind that makes it a little tough to use them.
2,FAT CAT CAN KEEP THESE POKER CHIPS,"A poker chip set with a four star rating and free shipping, good deal right?. Its not,they are poorly made plastic chips with colors that bled into each other or have blurred print. The manufacturer also forgot the last step in making the poker chips; which was smoothing the rough edges. I had bought this chip set to play with my friends and was more disappointed than they were.There are better chips on Amazon, you might worry that you will have to pay twenty dollars on shipping. I say, spend the extra twenty dollars and get a good chip set you can be proud of."
1,Terrible,I bought these and they are terrible. Supposedly clay but real bad finish. I broke open the seal and each chip set had scratches on the chips. It looked like these are manufacturing rejects that are being parceled off. The playing cards too had scratches on them. Overall it looked shoddy and used. I would request you not to waste your money on buying Fat Cat. Buy another chip set. I am very unhappy with my purchase.
1,Humiliation,"The inside of the case was broken and peices were missing. I would have returned it, but it was a gift for someone else, and they didnt have the time to take it back to the post office and return it. I would have liked to at least have it discounted. I would not recommend it, it was a humiliation as a gift."
4,My deployment vice,"Looked at >20 options for poker chips prior to purchasing these for our deployment. After reading beaucoup reviews, settled on this one b/c of the comments about the sturdier case. They arrived and are just as advertised. More than enough chips for 7-9 players. Every one in the platoon likes the heavier feel to the chips. Of course there is no fancy design and the 'painting' is sometimes a little rough, but these were under $50! I think the cost was very good for the quality/quantity of the chips. The case is not samsonite but has taken some beatings quite well and the inner layers keep stuff from moving around. Took off one star because of the dealer/blind buttons as they seem to have been an afterthought. This might seem kind of nitpicky but I couldn't take off just a half-star. For the price, you should not be disappointed!"
2,cheap,"broken plastic inside, rough chips, half unpacked. single use cards. case is only good, but unlockable. cheap cheap cheap cheap."
4,WOW-LIGHTNING FAST DELIEVERY!!,"I ordered these on Wednesday afternoon and had them in my hand in less than 24 hours...I realize it was only traveling from Irving to Plano, TX but still....WOW! I agree with the comments that this set is definitely a good set for the money. Colors are clear and there are some scratches, but you will have the same set of scratches after you play a game or two with them. Nice weight for home poker playing...nothing like my husband's Vegas style set as far as weight, stamping, etc. but this set is also about 6 times less $$$. I would definitely recommend for the money and the free shipping deal."
1,Not what was advertised,These chips are cheaply made and not what was described in the product reviews. The case is worth the money if that is all you are looking for.
3,"Quite Happy, but many chips have scratches","Chips are weighted nicely, however many have small and not-so-small scratches on them. It almost seems to me that they are second hand. Either way, they serve my purposes nicely."
4,Great product / cheap cards,"The product arrived and it's pretty much exactly as stated. Ergonomics of the handle are a bit small for normal to large hands and the middle latch gets in the way with the handle at times. Also, the two decks of cards provided in the set don't feel great. They appear to be of poorer quality based on the feel and weight. Otherwise, the weight of the chips are great."
3,For the price..,"For the price I'm not going to complain that much. The chips aren't perfect, most have a slight defect. Either scuff marks or small ridges on the side. The playing cards are crap, but I didn't order them for the cards. The inside lining isn't glued in, but easily fixed. The case isn't well built, one of the latches didn't close right unless you push it in and I fear if I carry it by the handle it'll break under the weight.Overall, they are chips and they'll work for my home games."
2,Bunk,Chips are crappy. Got ink all over my hands and half of them are not flush. Dealer button was missing. Case is flimsy. Do not buy this product!
3,it is ok,"i got it on time, but the case is broken. it is ok for me, coz i did not expect much for only 35 bucks."
1,Cosmetic blemish?? I think not. BROKEN!,Do not buy this item if it is cosmetically damaged and you are saving $10. The case was damaged...broken...and I had to replace it and when I contacted Amazon they did nothing to compensate and there was no way I was returning it at my cost for shipping. I recommend you stick with eBay and PayPal as there is some guarantee there you will get what you pay for and if the item has been misrepresented they will get you a refund!
3,"The price that you paid for, the quality that you got for","Pro:* I personally think that it has standard poker chips weight* Unlike many other people's review, my aluminum case was arrived safely without any dent.* The price is okay for this set of chipsCons:* It arrived a little bit late even though it was sent by FedEx* 1/5 of chips' paints have fallen off, or scratch on it or miss-print patterns* Little blind, Big blind, Dealer button are in cheap qualitySummary:In general, this poker chips set is Okay. For those people who are really into poker, this set will disappoint you if you buy it. For those who just want to play poker for entertainment, it is a pretty good choice for you! It's a great deal!"
1,shipped 3 times & damaged 3 times,"This product is ridiculous! I ordered this product and received it very quickly. However, when I received it, the case had a dent in it and one of the bottom support feet was broken. I contacted amazon and they sent me another poker set, and this one was damaged too. The plastic case that held the chips was cracked in several places. I called again and they sent me another poker set and this one had the same problem! I called again and then they told me that they would not send me another one and would only refund my money. Extremely frustrating!!! and on top of it this was supposed to be a Christmas gift!!! It may be a good price but it is not worth the time and effort! I would never recommend this product!"
1,Not the best Poker Set,First off the metal case was all beat up looked like it was kicked down a flight of stairs. The second thing is the chips they have plastic pieces falling off them (burs) plus some chips are cracked open you can even see the metal insert. Price is good the quality is terrible look else where.
3,"Good for the price, but not top quality","I read the reviews prior to buying the chips and got exactly what I expected.These are the standard 11.5g ""plastic"" chips. They have a decent feel.As previous reviewers mentioned, the chips are smudged, they don't fit in the case great, and the case was dented on arrival.OTOH, I have a nice set of chips at a good price.FYI: I received the following number of chips: 50 black, 50 green, 150 red, 100 blue, and 150 white (just as is displayed in the picture).The cards included are worthless - they're made out of glossy-printed cardboard, and will last at most through a shuffle or two (but it's amusing how exactly they plagiarized the packaging/look of ""Bee"" brand playing cards - the included cards are ""Bcg"" brand cards)."
3,"Great chips, great cards, shiny case...Oh Wait!","Okay where do I start. I was a little daunted when I read reviews on the Poker Case arriving damaged or dilapidated. Even with Super Saver Shipping, the product arrived in 4 days, (Including non buisness days). I opened the case and it was amazing. The case was unsullied, there was no damage to it whatsoever. The case was so great looking, it looked like it was packed to the top with $100 bills. The cards and chips were quite exceptional for the price. Chips were 11.5 grams and felt like real clay.I was so impressed with this set of chips. It was the exemplar of poker sets, the model to be imitated by other companies. It was too good to be true...Oh Wait! It is. One day after i recieved this item, i picked it up and the handle snaped off.I might submit it for a replacement, but I am going to attempt to repair it first.Great product, bad handleHappy Shopping, Amazon for best prices."
3,"Not recomended as a gift for someone else, but...","....they were good enough for me. I purchased the set only for the chips and they appear to be of good quality. They are nice heavier weight and will serve my purposes. With the free shipping from my Prime Membership, the price was a good one. The case, on the other hand, tends to make me think these were ""seconds"". Mine has a large crack in the back and one of the rubber ""feet"" which go on the bottom was completely missing. As I noticed this tended to be the case in other peoples feedback, I was ok with the chance that it might happen to me. If you have a place to store the chips, in the event that your case is less than good quality, you're good. Enjoy the chips, but be prepared to make allowances for the case."
5,A True Victory,"Twelve Hour Turn blends all the best parts of fast melodic hardcore, occassional sharp metalic riffs, and screaming to combine into an undeniably catchy sound. A lot of this record is up tempo, but some slower grooves (reminiscent of Hoover) are thrown in perfectly - enough to let you close your eyes and catch your breath, just in time for the next burst!If you are a fan of anything that gets your heart pumping and a smile on your face, this will not disappoint you! And if you look around (like on No Idea's site), you can find this much cheaper.."
4,I Disagree,"I disagree with the negative comments. I bought a copy of three of Philcox's books and the last one was the best of all. My handicapped brother (age 34) has tackled some of the projects and earned several thousand dollars. You can't earn the kind of money mentioned in the title with one project and that's explained in the book. You have to be motivated and choose several progject then get to work...no goofing off. A friend of mine bought the book and earns [$$$ per client just setting up video conferencing on their computer. He spends under [$$$] for hardware/software and keeps the rest. My suggestion? If you want to earn some money with your computer, buy it. Betty B in Chicago IL"
3,Good sunblock; minimal fading action,"This cream is fairly greasy so I only use it at night or when I don't plan on wearing make-up. Because of the greasiness, it's good to use as a sunblock (has SPF 25) if you don't plan on going in the pool or sweating a lot as it could wear off. As far as the skin lightening for darker pigmentation spots, I haven't noticed too much of an improvement on the dark patches under each of my eyes. It does say to use morning and night, but since I don't consistently do this, maybe that's why I haven't noticed a big difference in the appearance of my spots. Pre-pregnancy I was using Philosophy's Pigment of Your Imagination serum which definitely helped to fade the dark spots, but since becoming pregnant I discontinued the use of this product just to be safe. I can't wait until post-natal to start using it again because at least I know it works better than this cream."
4,Retro Romantic,Allan Ladd with dark hair could have played this role.A good read that can bring tears to your eyes.
2,Chewygizmo75,"When I received the pens they did not look like the ones in the picture. The picture shows that they have a silver barrel, the ones I received had the same color barrel as the grip."
1,Disappointing release from Calvin Russell,"On this release the laid back country rootsy blues of his previous excellent releases is gone replaced with a too loud upfront production that comes across sounding like an average 80s bar band. The only exception to this is ""In spite of it all"" which is truer to his previous releases. For me it was a disappointment and does not contain any memorable tracks and is marred by a weak set of songs. I am a fan of Calvin Russell's work and hope his next release is bck to his previous high quality."
2,"Save $$, buy the non-deluxe version","There isn't much deluxe about this game except the increased price. The non-deluxe plastic tokens have been replaced with dumb semi-flexible figurines. The game board folds into six sections (instead of in 1/2) so it doesn't lay flat unless played on a flat hard surface. Forget playing it on the bed as nothing will remain level. The two plastic bridges and castle have no way to insert into the game board and tend to move around and get in the way of game play. If only the game pieces had been magnetic, and stayed where they were placed, then I'd consider this to be deluxe. There isn't even a card holder/discard holder. The cards have the word ""Deluxe"" printed on them, oh whoopy doodle!! The playing board is loaded with busy graphics detracting from the simplicity of the game. So if you like this game, save your $$ and get the regular version."
2,A disappointment,"The deluxe characters are nice and the little bridges are OK, but the game board is a step down from the regular version. Rather than folding into two equal sections, the ""deluxe"" game board folds into six sections. The board tends not to lay perfectly flat. Since the size of the box would have allowed them to insert a normal board that folds into two sections, this is inexpicable. As my 5 year old asks - ""what's wrong with the board?"""
4,candyland,this is an all time favorite. I enjoyed it as a kid and now my little one will do the same.
4,Not bad.,"""Call to Duty"" was not bad as novels go. The idea of the two parallel plots, one in WW II and the other in the present-day, was an interesting concept, and each of the two plotlines on its own was excellent, however the constant switching between the two in the text did get a bit tiresome. A great insight into the background of Herman's characters, with favorites from The Warbirds, Firebreak, etc. A must-read for Richard Herman fans."
2,Horrible: Nothing like Against all Enemies,"This book had a good theme, but Herman did not play on this...this book was slow and full of more inside lingo than the last ones. i was very disappointed!"
2,Not Very Well Written,"I may be the one guy out there that does not like his books. What makes me mad is that I have heard so much good press I was excited about this book. The story sounded like it would be full of interesting stories and the duel plot was new, but it really did not rise to the occasion. I found the writing wooden and he just does not hold my attention. It takes a lot of time (or it seams that way) to get through this book. I do not know what slowed me down more; the disjointed writing or the two plots that seamed to just be thrown together. I did not believe the characters; they just were not well developed. I only made it about half way into the book. This book seams rushed, almost like the author did not want to take the time to really develop either the story or the characters. Because of the light development it does not hold your attention."
5,Good story - good book.,This novel was prehaps the best non-fiction novel i've ever read in my life. the double-plot was amazing and I loved this book. I rebought it for my last copy fell apart. I also bought the two novels that followed this novel.
4,encyclopedia of flags,"This book was good, and it had lots of infrmations. There were a lot of flags, and it is colorful. You should get this book if you like flags, or countres."
3,"Great new flag book, but...","With all the upheaval in the world over the last ten years, a new flag book was badly needed. And this is as good as any I've seen in some time. It's up-to-date, its coverage seems comprehensive, and its illustrations are spectacular.I did run across three rather glaring errors in the edition I own. The national flag designated as the flag of Taiwan is actually the flag of Taiwan's founding political party, the Kuomintang. Palestine seems to have the civil ensign of Spain. And the flag of Schleswig- Holstein is pictured but not identified.But if these and any other errors are corrected, this book will be as vital a flag reference as there is."
3,"beautiful, but many mistakes","My name is Derkwillem Visser Jr. editor of Vlaggen-Info, a Dutch/English magazine for people interested in flags, heraldry and history. This flagbook is absolutly beautiful done and I admire the work the autor did. However, there are made many mistakes, unfortunatly. But altough the mistakes, I strongly advise people who are interested in flags and history to get this book, you will not regret it and I'am glad Amazon.com is having it in store."
4,Good CD,"I bought this CD mostly for the music. I hadn't heard from any of the pianists, but Bernstein has always been one of my favorite conductors.I love Entremont's interpretation of the 2nd piano concerto. I have seldom heard such a colorful interpretation.However, Watts' interpretation of the 3rd piano concerto is not very good. As usual, after the piano solo of the theme is played, and when the orchestra gets the theme and the piano the accompaniment, it's chopped.Buy this CD for the 2nd pianoconcerto, but go for Ashkenazy when you want the 3rd piano concerto."
5,Down to earth South Florida history,"A down-to-earth book giving a glimpse into an era of nautical life before fiberglass boats became the status quo. A great description of commercial fishing and its people in South Florida as it was in the 40's, 50's and 60's. Includes vignettes of some of the community's colorful personalities. If you have any interest in South Florida's fishing industry and its history, this is a great book."
4,Review of the Grene/Lattimore 'Euripides III',"Again, Grene and Lattimore deliver an excellent collection of plays by Euripides. The language and clear and readable in all translations. However, I also continue my criticism that these works lack footnotes to guide readers through obscure mythological references. I believe the Arrowsmith translations have a few, but this should be more widespread.And interesting aspect to this volume in particular is the thematic unity of the plays. The first three all concern the division of skin and treasure after the fall of Troy. The fourth (Ion) is something of an anomaly, but was actually my favorite of all those within this volume."
3,Who IS that beautiful-funny cross-eyed girl??,funny very real -great neighborhood shots.Cross-eyed girl was the best!!funny beautiful too! who is she!??
1,No bargain at any price.,"It is a sense of civic duty that compels me to warn my fellow music lovers away from this thoroughly unpleasant recording. Entremont's playing is almost uniformly dull, and he seems utterly incapable of engaging the subtleties of Ravel's music. On a few occasions, Entremont manages to assert some originality, but his efforts seem misguided and obtrusive. In theory, I could sell my copy to a used CD store and recuperate a few miserable dollars, but conscience prevents me from doing so. If you like French piano music, and you have a couple more bucks to spend, read my review of Koechlin's ""Trois Oeuvres Maitresses"", then buy it forthwith. You'll thank me later.James Fanuzzi"
1,"Amen, Mr. Fanuzzi","I've just finished listening to the second disc of this set. I held off for several days after listening to the first disc because I was so disappointed in the hammering, loud, blurry playing. I didn't want my heart to be broken by a similar performance of Gaspard de Nuit and Le Tombeau de Couperin, the Ravel masterworks I really treasure. Alas, the same pounding, brick-on-the-damper pedal style that is suitable for George Winston ruined these subtly nuanced movements as well. Entremont sacrifices precision for speed, and consequently fails to deliver either. I wish I had consulted Mr. Fanuzzi's review before making my purchase.I recommend Robert Casadesus's recording of the complete Ravel piano works. One can wonder whether Mr. Ravel would have been pleased with the Entremont recordings if he likes, but no such speculation is necessary with Casadesus: he met Ravel as a young pianist and Ravel praised his performances."
3,acceptable product,These shoes are well designed and well made. They seem a little bulky and loose for the size. They are fairly comfortable.
1,cheap - not worth it,we bought these for my husband b/c he loves his kenneth coles. these look really cheap. he returned them without even trying on. not worth it.
5,Great Book,Great book and out daughter likes it Easy to read and she follows along with it. We have goats which makes it more fun for her.
1,Works well,This card lets me rip my Family VHS taps that were getting older by the day. Now I have them all on my PC
2,not as expected,"Was suppose to be for low profile but wasn't. I still can use it but, not for system I ordered it for."
5,Hi-Speed USB Cabability,"This USB 2.0 card was the best item that i could have bought for my older computer. USB 1.1 was just getting to be too slow. Then I found that card that cost my $4 and free shipping. That just can't be beat, other than free. It installed all on it's own in Windows XP. On my Windows 98SE computer, I had to download the drivers from Dynex's website and it installed easily as well.If you are looking to add USB 2.0 support to your computer, this is a great option!"
5,Flowmaster 42543 40 Series Delta Flow,"These mufflers are exactly what you expect from flowmaster, they sound great when you want them to and are much quieter at cruising speed than the original 40 series. I bought these for my 2003 Mustang GT and they were almost a perfect fit, a little shorter than the stock muffler and the in/out are 1/4"" larger than stock but that matches up great with an aftermarket x-pipe and tailpipes. They also shipped very fast, arriving in less than 48 hours with the free shipping. I can't speak for many other models but if you put these mufflers on a 4.6 mustang you will not be disappointed."
5,Great sound,Put this on my 2007 ford ranger with 4.0l and love the sound!! I dumped it at the axle and never looked back on the beauty of the sound!
1,Confusing!,"This is one of the most confusing educational books I have ever read. It is beautifully illustrated but the diagrams, when studied closely, are poorly labelled, do not accord with the text and overlap one another in a misleading way. The text itself is very hard to digest, uses lots of jargon and fails to explain the pictures/diagrams. In addition there is no attempt made to show how the principles so poorly explained can be applied to real drawing situations. In short, I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,incorrect,This book actually contains incorrect information on one of the most difficult things for students to grasp: how rolled cylinders work.
3,nearly 300% price increase?!,"The product works well, but within the last 12-15 months, its price skyrocketed from about $18.95 to $54.95 !!What the heck?At the $55 price, it's no longer a good value -- why I only gave it 3 stars.I will seek alternative solutions."
2,Different,"This movie is different, to a certain extent humorous. But it is not a really good film by any means."
5,Literary Cafes of Paris,"I read this after visiting Paris for 2 weeks and staying in the St. Germain area. This small book was packed full of stories, history and information about the cafes in that area. My biggest regret is not reading this book before visiting Paris. It would have added a new dimension to the St. Germain area. If you are going to Paris, read this book and then walk the streets of this section of Paris to fully appreciate the area."
1,Not worth it..........,"I decided to buy this book instead of the other book by Light and now I realize it was not the right decision.This book has various drawbacks which I've found after reading 5 chapters.- Its badly written especially the grammar,I understand many authors are from non english speaking countries but don't they edit these chapters?- somewhere its mentioned the authors were not paid for writing the chapters and this may have got something to do with the final book- apart from a few chapters most of the information in this book can be found in murray and nadel and uptodate.- Its by no means exhaustive and is a poor source of reference for pleural diseases.- for eg I was looking for information on rickettsial lung/pleural diseases and I found more info on Harrison's then in this book.Big Disappointment and a waste of 180$.Unfortunately by the time I realized this book is not worth it, it was already past 30 days and so am stuck with it for ever....."
4,Big Band Mingus,"This album is a great example of Mingus in charge of a big band. It is not the usual combo Mingus, if you are looking for this I would suggest New Tiajuana Moods or The Jazz Experiments of Charles Mingus. This group not only has Hampton and Mingus but also Gerry Mulligan on bari, Danny Richmond on drums and Woody Shaw on trumpet. This album is not revolutionary but is a fine recording of Mingus with a large group."
3,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--Disappointing,"I've enjoyed the other collections of Mr. Chiodo's works, and that's the problem.This *is* ""the other collections of Mr. Chiodo's works"". There are A LOT of repeats from his other books in these pagesOld material from his website abounds, & far too much text is crammed in.I suspect an additional collection was mandated by contract with his publisher, & this was the result."
1,Watch out!!!,This does not fit all models - you could be wasting your time if you order this product
3,Does NOT work with the new Moto Q 9h,"Overall quality does seem nice, however, as mentioned before, the description does not say for which Moto Q phone this is designed. It does NOT work with the Moto Q9h."
1,The Touch stinks,"In the first place, the sound and video are not in sync... maybe just in the one I got, but the movie is not worth replacing! The picture on the case doesn't depict Costner as he is in the movie.It is a B movie at best, and Costner must have been 15 when he made it... the picture looks like it's a recent movie.Also, the movie STINKS!!!Don't go near this one if you are a Costner fan... it must be an embarrasment to him. There is no redeeming factor in this movie... It just plain STINKS!"
4,Great,"I gotta tell you Dusty is an interesting charcter. She's alot like her father but is much stronger than him in ways of the heart and helps comfort her whole family during the tough times that come in the book while being a teenage girl. She is really inspiring how she never gives up on the snow pony and I must tell you if you want a heartwarming story but one where bonds are constantly being pushed then you'll love this book, you have my word on it."
3,Pretty but not what you think,The watch is very pretty but it is geared more for a smaller wrist or for a woman who likes a petite watch.
4,decent overview,"This book provides a decent overview of the different aspects of computer/information security, and is an easy read, but if you are a software developer or IT professional, you may want to consider purchasing a few more specialized books instead."
4,Review of Information Security Illuminated,"I had the good fortune to study under the co-author of this book Mike Chapple and we used this book as a text for the course. The book is layed out well for a class text on the subject matter. Over all it is clear and concise.This is not to say that anyone won't gain knowledge from this book. I ended up reading the entire book (which was not covered in the class) and have picked up just as much information from the book.For those out there attempting to gain security knowledge, this book gives you just that very well."
2,mixed feelings,"** I had to really concentrate while reading this book. At first I felt sorry for Jordan, living in New York. And the way Kimberly talked and acted I figured from the beginning that she either was black or half black. I just knew she had some soul in her. I don't know when I read a book I get so involved in it. They weren't sterotyped charecters, but it was the way they conversed."
4,Good Book.,"The book was good, as was his other books but this one I could put down and come back to, although his others were definite page-turners. The fact of the black women in the story being so mean and hateful was a bit much but I guess if that is something that Mr. Dickey notices or maybe has experienced either through personal or someone he knows, then I guess he is writing from experience. Good read."
4,"HEY EJD, WHAT'S YOUR PHONE NUMBER?","I have read all three of EJD's books and Milk In My Coffee was typical Dickeyesque. It has wit, insight, great dialogue, and the story takes you somewhere. I didn't think I'd like Milk In My Coffee, but it was a pretty good read. Now to the next big question. EJD, what is your phone number? You are a great guy!"
1,Give me a break this is a total waste of my money,I must have not read the same book as the rest of you. The whole story is totally unrealistic and is full of character assassination. I know that everyone has there own little secrets but none of these people are true to themselves or the people they say that they love. I have to agree w/the QUEEN from Washington she is one of the few people that told the truth about this book. One last commit for Jonathan Smith for you to even have the preconceived notion that black women are out there torturing black men tells me that either you are not African American or you have already cross over the other side and my point is that you my friend will never be able to understand the depth that this reader is trying to give to you. And if you ARE black then you need to ask yourself who are you being true to.
4,You Must Read,Milk In My Coffee talked about how two feel in love with one another despite their differences. They realized that color doesn't matter and that they would be together despite what everybody thinks. We should all learn from this and my black sisters let's not hate on the other sister's who date our black men because we date their men as well. If you like milk in your coffee I say more power to you and don't playa hate.
1,I Love BLACK Coffee,"Good I thought I was the only EJD fan that didn't care for MIMC. I disliked this book. He made ALL the black female characters seem ghetto. Made the white female character Kimberly seem perfect. Kimberly was more confused than any of the characters. She lied about who she was to Jordan from the very start. He made Jnette seem evil. For Jordan to be so BLACK and never been attractived to white women, it was strange seeing him falling hard in a short period for a white woman. She was white when it was right for her, and black when she was ignorant and a liar. I beleive EJD was trying to cross-over with this book. Trying to look good with white readers, BUT we black readers, mostly female BLACK readers are buying & reading your books."
4,Life of my own...,"Well this book is a lot like me. When I read it it became the ""story of my life"". I am a white female who loves some black men, but they never known if its right to be with me because of our ""color barrier"". So I know where the charcters Jordan and Kimberly are coming from at all times. I am also in the process of reading ""CHEATERS"". If you liked ""MILK IN MY COFFEE"" then I am almost positive that you will enjoy another on the Dickey's heart felt, well lived tales.THNX(...)"
4,Great....... Well Written,"This book was really good, I loved the twists and turns that the author allows the character to take. I will be honest, I was moved the most attowared the end of the novel. I would recommend this one for any book club, even Oprah's"
3,This book is somewhat insulting to Black women,"First, this was an interesting book to read and although it was offensive to me, as a black woman at times, I couldn't put it down because I was intrigued by the subject matter. The author could have found a better way to make Kimberly a likeable white woman without making the sistas look evil, uneducated and wild. Frankly, I don't know any black women who are as volatile in their manner as the characters found in this book. This is a very touchy topic among the sistas and I feel the author could have handled it much better. I also didn't like the big revelation at the end. I thought the author should have ""stuck to his guns,"" so to speak. However, there are a few good laughs and some truly good writing in this book. As always, I will continue to be a fan of the author and continue to read his books. Peace!"
5,A Must Read !,This book was full of twists and turns that will keep you reading and guessing. Jordan and Kimberly are made for each other and this book takes you deep into their lives. EJD has out done himself with this novel. The conclusion was SmooVe.
5,the book was real. because no matter what you see yourself.,i thought this book was so good. it was worth taking it from my husband. it really need to be a movie. cause it would make all races think about them selves and how they think about their own heritage.
5,Outstanding!!,The plot twists kept me turning the pages as I waited to see what would happen next. The surprise ending was somewhat predictable but handled well. The characters were far from predictable and very real.
5,Eric Jerome Dickey has created his third masterpiece!!!,"I have read Sister,Sister and Friends and Lovers , both books were great. Then I experienced Milk in my Coffee which is more compassionate, intriguing and emotional than any of EJ Dickey's previous novels. While I was reading Milk in my Coffee it seemed like Jordan and Kimberly were talking to me. Eric's writing is phenomenal, he's straight to the point and true to life. Dickey's words are soooo vivid you'll truly feel you're in NY freezing with Jordan or feeling his passion. Eric Jerome Dickey touches on all the emotions and frustations we all feel once in our lives like: loneliness, abandonment, love and much more! I recommend ALL of Eric Jerome Dickey's books because they are all the BOMB!!!!!"
5,Spell binding!!!!!,"This added to the production of fine work from Eric. It definitely had me hooked. Although, I had to work hard to get past the initial contact with Kimberly. It jumped too quick into the relationship. As the chapters went on, it prove to be an excellent story line. Thanks Eric for another excellent book."
3,The book makes black women look bad,"Mr. Dickey is a good writer and I am looking forward in read Friends and Lovers right now. However I have major issues with this book. It really makes the black woman look bad. None of the black women were positive, just Kimberly. As a black woman living in NY, I don't know anyone like the black women in the book. I also didn't like the reference in the book were the main character insult all the black women by comparing their weaves to Kimberly's real hair.I don't think it was necessary. Being that African-American women are the main readers, I think Mr. Dickey has to take some statements into consideration."
1,Too Many Stereotypes,"The novel plays up to the stereotype that all black men want a white woman. Also that he would leave a good black woman the moment a white woman gives him glance. After reading this novel, I know that I would never read or purchase anything else by this author. I am very disappointed in this book as well as for this person being of African-American origin."
3,Just Okay,"This book wasn't bad it just wasn't good either. ItW as all over place. This could have been two novels instead of one Reggie, Darrell and Jordan could have its own story line. Not sure why these character were introduce in this book. I would have loved for it to been more about Kimberly and Jordan."
2,"Easy, predictable read","This book touches on but never fully explores interracial romance. Sure, there's background characters that question the love affair, and you do get a sense of the reluctance that the main character feels, but it's really only 2 dimensional. I bought this book to read on an airplane, and really that is all it's good for. It's not particularly funny, or the characters particularly thought-provoking. I haven't read Dickey's other novels, so if you're looking for one of his to read, I suggest you begin with a different one."
4,NYC and tricky relationships,"I enjoyed Milk in My Coffee for the following reasons: It takes place in NYC, the characters were somewhat compelling, and there are some serious plot twists at the end.Up until the plot twists, I found this story to be sort of boring. I was wondering what was going to happen with the main characters. I figured, if they just continued on and lived happily ever after, I'd have wasted my time with this book. But the ending is interesting, and that is why I put the book down feeling satisfied.This is a good summer read that will have you thinking about relationships, human nature, and NYC."
4,"Great Book, colorful, hip, and mordern","Whoever doesn't like this book is crazy, it's odvious that they can't enjoy African-Amerocan literature. Milk in my Coffee has spice, it's a creative way of showing one of today's major issues from both sides. I'm a African-American woman and I don't feel threatened by white women because I know what I've got is real. So we all need to keep it real and give the man his props!! Eric Jerome you go boy, job well done!"
4,Really Memorable,"I think Jordan (the main character), is the type of man that most women would kill for. Unlike his 2 crazy brothers. :o) This book was funny, romantic and touching. You could feel his pain over the break up with his best friend Soloman. I wanted to give him a can of whoop a--!! Kimberly was lively, adventurous and real. The hospital scene with Jordan and her parents had me rolling on the floor laughing. Thanks for making my couple of days Mr. Dickey. Great job!!!"
5,Best Book Ever!,"I love this book! This is one of the best books I've ever read. I love the author, he is very intelligent ands funny."
2,Milk in my coffee,"There is nothing progressive about this story as it relates to inter-racial relationships between a black man and white woman. Again, we have an author trying to sell us on the black man white woman relationship. In this case the author attempts to create a white female character that black female readers won't hate. Unlike real life situations, where the white female is usually uneducated and of lower class, this one is a professional, and so I assume she is suppose to be an exception.Sorry, it's still bulls_________. Regardless of her short comings, the white woman will always be placed before us as the ideal woman, mother, lover, etc and many Black men have bought into that big lie."
4,Milk in My Coffee is a must-read,"It was refreshing to read a book that ahd the courage to tackle the subject matter of interracial dating. More often than not, films and novels dealing with this topic insult our intelligence because they choose to focus only on the sexual part of the relationship and not the spiritual side. Jordan and Kimberly's attraction to each other was clearly more than physical. I loved this book because it deals with interracial dating in a mature, humorous, and honest manner. It will make you rethink about your stereotypes."
4,Excellent book. Controversial subject. Must read.,"Excellent book. The characters have real-life problems.Mr. Dickey has once again written a book that everyone can relate to. The characters are written with sensitivity and emotional depth. You find yourself immersed in the problems of the characters and realize that ""true love"" will win everytime."
5,entoxicating,Milk in my Coffee is the kind of book that makes you want to see the movie. Your turning the pages to find out what the hell is gong to happen in the end...and you are not disappointed!!
4,"Not as intriguing as its predecessors, but a must read.","Dickey has done it again!! If you liked any of his other books, then I guarantee you will love this one as well. The story of a black man falling for a white woman is not at all new. However, Dickey has a way of introducing each character that allows much love for all of them!!!! There are no color lines in this book. It's all good. His other novels are a bit more 'juicy' but this one will leave you satisfied as well."
4,"Very Entertaining, but typical","I enjoy all of Eric Jerome Dickey's books, however, I am a little tired of books that depict black women as bitter, hateful and mean. We are not all like that and it makes us seem as if we are mad at the male race. When is an author going to write a book about a brother and sister helping each other in this ""dating"" environment. I have plenty of friends that are in interracial relationships and they don't get the stares that they think are getting. Interracial dating has become accepted by society. However, the book is entertaining. Thanks Mr. Dickey for another good read."
5,This book is awesome!!,"This book is awesome and the first book that I have read by this author. It was funny,sincere, sensual, and full of life!!! I must admit after reading this book, I no longer have a dislike for interracial relationships. I fully believe this book was meant for me to read in order to get rid of that bitterness toward mixed relationships!! Love is love.. regardless of the people involved. I loved the book and would give it 10 stars if I could!!! READ THE BOOK!! :-)"
5,""" Almost as if it came right out of someones life""","Dickey shows what sosme relationsihps are really about. Full of twists and turns of love, sex, and family."
4,good,"Makes you think out side the box. There are people who are still having issues with interracial couples and this breaks the mold.any issues that u have are personal, and u have to look within yourself to cope. A bold move to give a glimpse of what interracial couples go through as a test within their relationships."
4,Totally caught off guard.,I thoroughly enjoyed the duration of this wonderful piece of fiction. It periodically caused me to wonder if it was fiction at all. The characters were vibrant and humorous. The setting and use of words were interesting and captivating. I found this to be an excellent read with quite a few interesting twists at the end.
4,"GOOD, BUT CHEATERS WAS BETTER","I ENJOYED MIMC, HOWEVER CHEATERS WAS A LOT BETTER. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHY AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN CHOSE TO DATE WHITE WOMEN BUT THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN OR COULD HAPPEN IN AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE'S RELATIONSHIP."
4,I loved the story but the ending...,"The story was okay the problem was the back and forth between jordan and j'nette then the part with his brother reggie was touching that got to me although I haven't being there. the end of the story lack information and the guessing what happen didn't help. mr. Dickey lets hope your next book is steamy, exciting and sexy."
5,Excellent and exciting stories about relationships.,"I read both Friends & Lovers and sister,Sister in two days. I can't decide which is actually my favorite. My friends and I all read both books and can hardly find another topic at the table to discuss now, thanks to Eric Jerome Dickey.I am now about to read Milk In My Coffee and am looking so forward to a another brilliant tale of men and women.Keep up the great work!!!"
5,Milk in My Coffee is a must read,"It was refreshing to read a book that had the courage to tackle the very sensitive issue of interracial dating. Jordan and Kimberly were very real people with very real hangups. EJD does not insult the readers intelligence by painting easily drawn stereotypes a lot us tend to buy into. The main characters' attraction to each other was sincere and genuine, not just physical. Eric Dickey's gift for detail makes the story flow and feel the pain Jordan and Kimberly go through. EJD is a talented author who's voice will be heard for a long time. Thank you for your funny, poignant, and honest book."
3,Is is OK to pass?,"I read this book and some of the online reviews. Am startled that no one seems to address the fact that the Kimberly character is ""passing"" for white because it's easier for her. There's something fundamentally wrong with pretending to be something you're not. According to the book Kimberly's father is half black, even if her mother is white that makes Kimberly at least 1/4 black. You're still considered black until there's only 1/16th black blood in you so, she's a ""black woman passing as a white one"" I was disgusted."
3,three and a half stars maybe..........................,"This book started off very slow, it took a few chapters to warm up. I think there were a few chapters that we could have done without. It wasn't very boring, however it also wasn't one of those I can't put this book down novels either. A good book to read, if your going to be sitting under the hair dryer or something..... It was ah-ight overall."
3,Good Book!!!!!!!!_Bad Ending^^^^^^^,I think Eric Jerome Dickey is great author and did a great job on this book as well. Though I didn't like the ending. I also didn't agree with how Kimberly got beat up or mugged. The begginning of the book was great. It was great how he met her in a cab. The way he let the stereotype out that he was a black man waiting on a cab that wouldn't stop for him was excellent. I love the way he eased into the relationship with Kim. Janetta was crazy though. She was pregnant and then just came out the blue and said she wanted an abortion. I think that Jordan was totally there for Janetta.
1,Could not get into this book.,Did not like this book after 3 chapters. I usually enjoy reading Jerome's books. But this one really stunk.
5,An inspirational outlook on 90's relationships,I loved this book. The detail created so much shape and the characters voice through the words painted a powerful imagry of the not so typically shown avenue of romance novels. Kudos to the author.
5,GREAT!!!!!!,"Lot's of surprises.whenever I thought I knew the outcome of a particular subplot, there would be a surprising twist. I couldn't put this book down. I have just ordered all his other books. This man can write!!!!"
4,Insightful!!!,Milk in my Coffee gives an extremely insightful account of interacial romance and the internal conflict a brotha went through before he took the step for LOVE!!!
5,Good Book,"This was definitely a good book. The storyline was tight, the chracters well developed, and the plot kept me on edge. Another great job by a great author. Congratulations EJD. Looking froward to your next book. But I'd also like to repeat your request: IN GIVING YOUR REVIEWS, PLEASE DO NOT REVEAL KEY PARTS TO THE PLOT!! It ruins things for everyone else. Let the readers find out on their own. Best of wishes EJD!"
2,Did we read the same book?,"Okay I've read, Friends and Lovers by EJD and loved it!!! I read the reviews before I read this one. While I have to say that EJD is a fascinating writer, literally speaking, what in the heck was he doing with this one? The reviews on this book for the most part baffle me. There was no in depth discovery of inter-racial relationships or relationships period. Every relationship in this book was bad, expecially between Jordan (the main character) and the other black women. His relationship with his best friend was even horrible and I personally don't see brothers vibing like that. This characterization to me was inconsistent. The only decent relationship in the book was between Jordan and Kimberly, the white, black, white woman? Hello???? I am all for whatever floats your boat in terms of relationships but to depict every black relationship as a travesty of mankind was a big turn-off. Try again Mr. Dickey. Please try again."
1,I threw the book in the trash and do not regret it.,I think of books as friends to keep forever and enjoy having and sharing. For the first time in my life I threw out a book that I spent hard earned money on. It was so very vulgar that I could not even give it away. What an awful disappointment. Zero stars is the most appropriate.
3,The Best is Yet to Come!,"I have enjoyed the work of EJD ever since I read ""Sister, Sister"" which I consider to be his best work thus far . . . having read all his others. Call me biased but I enjoy books that make me laugh out loud. MIMC provided very few laughs particularly near the end of the book. I find the interracial love story between black men/white women--very old and very tired--although I did enjoy reading it from a man's p-o-v. How about the flip side from a man's perspective?I liked what I believed to be the ""strong"" friendship between Jordan and Solomon. The twists presented near the end shocked and surprised me. Although I can't rate MIMC with more than three stars I still recommend this book for a fast read. I look forward to reading the trials and tribulations of EJD's future characters!"
4,"okay, but not as good as friends & lovers","I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE A GOOD READ. I LOVE EJD'S WORK AND CAN' T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE, SO KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
4,A definite page turner,"Mr. Dickey has presented his finest work yet. Like Wally Lamb he captures the essence of women, particularly our ideals of relationships with family and friends. Mr. Dickey also embraces our fears about interracial relationships. This novel is filled with surprises."
4,This Book Is An Eye-Opener.,"I did not realize that I had grown small- minded in my views on interracial dating. While this book was entertaining (something I've come to expect from Mr. Dickey), Milk in My Coffee is also thought-provoking. Not only does it bring out external racism, it touched on the internal racism that still lingers within the African-American community. Mr. Dickey took a taboo subject and turned it into an explosive love story."
3,Entertaining read,"I have read all of Dickey's books, and they have all been great reads, however, I had a hard time with this book. It moved kinda slow in the beginning, and there was too much drama at the end. Also, I guess I was secretly hoping that Jordan would leave everyone, and start a new life in California. Kimberly had too many secrets for me. Nevertheless, good read, and ill look forward to the next."
3,Pretty Good,"3 1/2 stars for this one...I love EJD and I've read all but two of his books (they're next on my list!). This was a solid story that kept my attention, however I normally read EJD's books in two or three days, but this one took me nearly a week (it wasn't as much of a page-turner as the others).The story was fine, I was bored when Jordan went back to Tennessee to meet back with his brothers, but I think EJD just wanted to represent his hometown and alma matter, so I see why he did it. That section of the book (which was at least 20% of the book) was somewhat out of place, though. He should have kept the story strictly about Jordan and Kimberly.A lot of drama in the last 75 pages. It was like he got all of his ideas at the end and threw them in to get the reader all excited. That was okay, but it took away from the relationship that was central to the story.Overall, a good book. I recommended it to a white female friend who is in a relationship with a black man."
4,One of His Best,"I love EDJ and this book is one of his best. The twist and turns, lies and betrayal had me up all night.This book made me smile. Kimberly and Jordan were very likeable characters. Their ""love story"" is classic."
5,Very Enjoyable,What an entertaining book. I could hardly put it down. The characters were so well developed as well as the story line. I loved all the twists and turns and the trip down to Tennessee was hysterical. A must read...you won't regret it.
4,Excellent,"Eric J. Dickey is a great author. You can really get into his books. This book is about a good man who has the wrong girl but finds the right girl. The only problem with the right girl is she's white, or aleast he thinks she is. You have to read this book. You won't put it down, believe me."
3,The book was entertaining but lacked substance.,"I am a man who likes his coffee black and likes to read books with substance. The book was an easy read, the plot moved quickly and there was no shortage of excitement and entertainment. However, I was expecting a book that dealt, in a realistic fashion, with the issues involved in an inter-racial relationship. I was teased, lead on and eventually hung out to dry at the end of the book. I came away from the experince feeling cheated. The story had a lot of potential but did not deliver on its promise."
4,Eric Dickey writes a fabulous book,"I have read all three of Eric Dickey's books, and they're all great. I had preconceived notions about this book from the title, and was a little disappointed at the twist in the book. As a partner in an interracial marriage,(white/asian) I thought it would be more about their overcoming their differences, and the prejudices of society toward miscegenation. However, It is still a fabulous book, and Eric Dickey is an extremely talented writer. I look forward to reading more of his work in the future."
5,You Go Boy!!!,"I really enjoyed the book. I've read all of Eric Jerome Dickey books. My favorite is ""Friends and Lovers"". This book was an eye-opener for me. I saw a lot of stereotypes that hit home. The book was well done and I could actually feel what Jordan was going through with his best friend Solomon and Janette. Keep up the good work Mr. Dickey, You did it again."
5,Omigosh...this book was really good,"I have nothing against interracial relationships but I wasn't up on reading one either. Well the saying is true to it's name ""You can't judge a book by it's cover,"" because this was a real page turner. I picked it up expecting a light read and what I was hit with was some hardcore reality. EJD not only came with a tough subject, but he also mastered it. This book can change many people's opinion on out-of-race relationships. Keep it up!"
5,Another Great Novel By Eric Jerome Dickey,"Milk in My Coffee is a MUST read and a Must have book for your collection of great novels. I enjoyed the book from start to finish. I would recommend this book to anyone, so try it-you WILL like it!! Eric Jerome Dickey is by far one of the best authors there is. I would also highly recommend Eric's first two novels Sister, Sister and Friends and Lovers."
3,"It was good, but not all that","Dickey's story telling has definitely improved from his previous two efforts. I was very attentive three-quarters of the way, until the last fourth. It didn't make any sense to place such a severe twist towards the end. It left me puzzled. It would recommend it, but would also mention that it's a ""light read."""
4,great read,"This was a great book, EJD's best yet. It started off really good and interesting, but then lagged off in the middle with the problems with Jordan's brother Reggie. I mean, it was interesting, but I really didn't see what it had to do with the story. But it picked up at the end again, when Kimberly's, Solomon's, and J'Nette's secrets come out. The characters were very believable (especially Jordan and Zoe). I give EJD 2 thumbs up for this one and I can't wait to read Cheaters."
5,Tastes better than Starbucks,"This book was great. It allowed you to be on the inside looking out instead of the outside looking in. I was a woman who wasn't to fond of a strong black man with a white woman, but after reading Milk in my Coffee, I realized love can be found anywhere. I commend Jordan and Kim for overcoming the stares and the sneers and believing love would see them through. You Go Mr. Dickey, the book was extremely well written and witty."
3,Witty but disturbing,"Eric Jerome Dickey's style is unsurpassed. I applaud him for taking on a subject that is still taboo and very seldomly publicly aknowledged, especially amongst African American women (interracial dating). However, even though I enjoyed his style and depth of characterization, I could not help but feel demonized by the African American female characters especially J'Nette, her sister and friends and Wanda. There were few redeeming qualities amongst the group. This disturbed me. Once again I felt the characteristics of these Black women justified, Black, Jordan Green's relationship with White, Kimberly Chavers rather than it being about these two people getting through their own personal tragedies, including the hows and whys of how they and others will view their relationship. However, Mr. Dickey is very witty and his depth truly pulls you in. I say this is a must read that will spark some discussion. I urge each individual to read it and make assessments for themselves."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"I ENJOYED READING ABOUT A SUBJECT THAT I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD ENJOY READING ABOUT.THERE WERE SOME PARTS OF THE STORY WHERE I THOUGHT THAT THE AUTHOR WAS STRETCHING. (IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I THOUGHT SOME THINGS WERE A LITTLE RIDICULOUS.) EXAMPLE, I CAN'T IMAGE TWO PEOPLE MEETING AND BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP FROM AN HALF HOUR CAB RIDE. IT SEEMED A LITTLE FAR FETCHED.THE WAY THAT JORDAN RESPONDED TO J'NETTE'S CONFESSION WAS NOT REALISTIC. I DIDN'T FIND KIMBERELY'S SECRET BELIEVEABLE EITHER. IT SEEM LIKE SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST MADE UP TO GIVE THE BOOK A TWIST. IF THE MESSAGE WAS INTERRACIAL DATING THEN WHY ADD THIS DRAMA? IT CHANGES THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF THE STORY.THE FOCUS OF THE BOOK WAS LOST ABOUT TWO THIRDS THE WAY THROUGH. I COULDN'T CONNECT JORDAN'S FAMILY SITUATION AND SOLOMON'S DRASTIC CHANGE TO THE POINTS THAT THE AUTHOR WAS TRYING TO MAKE ON INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIPS.MANY REVIEWS SAY THAT THIS IS DICKEY'S BEST WORK YET, IT WAS RATHER MEDIOCRE IN MY OPINION."
5,"""Very moving and believable""",This book is so captivating that I did not want to put it down. It wraps you up into the characters and you really feel each of their very different perspectives.Very good reading!
3,Haven't Made Up My Mind Yet,"Story was interestering. I love the way Mr. Dicke writes, he has a flair for description down to a tee. I especially enjoyed the scenes when Jordan was in the south, as a person from the south, I really related to a few scenes. I'm a little mixed on the Soloman character; I feel as though he changed right before my eyes. I don't know how I feel about the relationship between Kimberly and Jordan -- part of me was happy that they found love, yet another part of me found it to be totally unrealistic. I still luv my Eric and will allways continue to support him in his endeavors."
1,Shallow characters prevail in this unimaginative book.,"I felt that the characters, from Jordan to Solomon, and from Jeanette to Kimberly were all very one dimensional and unbelievable. The story never explains itself. Why is Kimberly attracted to Jordan, and vice versa. Why are Solomon and Jeanette such bitter and terrible people. The end is a cop out, so you do not get the chance to really explore ""inter-racial"" dating.Additionally, both Jordan and Kimberly were completely against dating and marrying each other, yet in the end...and again, why??? Neither are desirable people, and would both benefit from a bit of psychological attention. Are there people actually like this??? Needless to say, I did not like this book."
4,calm dow people!,"Some of the reviewers need to check themselves before writing about this novel. EJD was not commenting on every interracial relationship, and I doubt the brother really knew anything about YOUR life and situation before he wrote the book. Now with that said I think that EJD did a wonderful job with the characterizations in the book overall. I didn't come away with the feeling that any one particular group was bad, but that all the characters were flawed, individual human beings. The plot ""twist"" was not a cop out for me, but an interesting view of the American situation. We need to ask ourselves, what is white? what are the definitions? There is no such thing as racial purity in this nation of ours, and I think that EJD brings that to the fore.His characters, plot, and descriptions are all well crafted and VERY believable. This is a story that could happen to any one of us. It's a wonderful book.Just what I'd expect from an Alpha man *smile*"
3,almost as good as the cover,"honestly. i picked this book up, because the artwork on the cover caught my eye! the novel itself was a little too explicit for my taste, but it was a fun read nonetheless (got me through several boring hours on a plane & sitting in airports) & i actually enjoyed the trip to memphis -- that seemed like the most ""real-life"" part of the novel to me. (i LOVED wanda! whoo-eee, i'd like to see more of HER! she cracked me UP! & i'm pretty certain she must be madea's long-lost cousin! :D) i also thought the twist was a cop out, but, then again, it made me think about all the petty head-trips people (like me) suffer through on a daily basis. overall, the novel has a good message -- i just wish it was G-rated."
3,not the average black on white novel,"this was different in a sense that it didn't portray the old age tale of a black guy ""selling out"" to be with an all american white girl. some storylines make the white girl more ""ok"" to be with because she has dark hair and/or dark eyes or vice versa with the black guy being light skined and/or having light eyes. but not in this book. they were flat out black and white. the only thing i really disliked about this was the black girl here. she made me wanna scream. she was SO damn confused, money hungry, angry, and mentally and emotionally abusive to this good man. all black woman are NOT like this.but this is a winter book. so enjoy this cuddled up in a blanket in the winter while the snow is falling."
3,Good Book,"Milk in My Coffee was a pretty good book, although I felt that in a way it was not very realistic. I like Eric Jerome Dickey's style and I think he is a very good writer. I have purchased two of his other books after I read Milk in My Coffee but I haven't had a chance to read them yet. If you believe in out-of-the-ordinary love stories, this book is definitely the one for you."
4,Job well done....,"I really enjoyed this book. It was the first of his books for me so I didn't go into with any high or low expectations. But I did come out of it vowing to read ALL of his books. This book held my attention to the VERY end. What I liked most about the book was the fact that when you read the title, you automatically assume,""Oh just another book about an interrracial relationship"". But in the end, boy did he give more than just what I expected. I enjoyed the book and I enjoy him, Eric Jerome Dickey, as a writer. I wish him much success."
4,Very interesting book,"I really liked this book, it really took me by surprise. I had no idea none of those things were going to happen at the end, like a lot of books I've read, you can kind of predict was it going to happen. I normally just read while I'm on the bus, but I could not but this book down, I even read as I walked down the street. It had so many suprises in it. I love the way Eric fitted in Kimberly's dream. Most of the surprising parts had me on the bus oohing and ahhing, people were looking at me like I was crazy! At first I didn't agree with the relationship with Jordan and Kim and the way he portrayed the sistas. But it is a lot of sistas with attitudes like that. I wish the ending could have been a little different, but I quess everybody needs love. I recommend this book to everyone."
3,Not as good as the other 2 books!,"Milk in My Coffee was ok but not as good as the first two books. I felt that you could have portrayed sisters a little better!!! We are not all dumb compared to our European counterparts. Hopefully, 'Cheaters' will make up for this last novel."
5,"Excellent book, impossible to put down!","Eric Jerome Dickey's ""Milk in my Coffee"" is the most open and honest book on such a controversial topic I have ever read. This book was real, tear jerking and humorous. I have a new favorite."
3,"I guess Every book can't be the bomb, but it was still good","Eric I have read all of your books, I kind of mixed them up from newest to oldest but that as cool. I like how your characters from older stories appear in your new books it makes your boks even more interesting. Milk in my coffee was my least favorite, I'm not sure why but it just wasn't an attention grabber I was more less trying to find the good part thru the whole book. It did get interesting towards the end though. But every other book I love. They are all the bomb I give the rest 5 stars,I have all of my co workers and family reading your books right after me. I'm waiting for your new novel for 2004. Don't keep us waiting to long.Theves Paradise was alot different from every other book, it wasn't really a love stoty but it was good. I don't know any other writer that can make the reader picture exactly how the characters in your book look."
2,Expected so much more...........,"This is the first book I have read by Eric Jerome Dickey. After hearing so much about his books and how great they were, I finally bought one to read. Boy! was I disappointed, I expected so much more from the book. There were certainly some unexpecteds in this storyline, but ultimately it left me thinking where is the rest of the book? It seemed unfinish! I'd be hard pressed to buy another one of his books."
4,Milk in My Coffee,"Milk in My Coffee is a pretty good book. It has a serious tone at times while there are funny moments also. Dickey kept me reading because I could'nt wait to see what would happen next. Throughout the book new twist and turns popped up which kept me interested. I cannot wait to see how the book turns out. The issue of dating outside your race is common but it is not noticed as much as he made it seem. Dating caucasian males myself I understand the issues that he brings forth but they don't bother me that much. I think that I have a choice to date any race no matter what anyone says so I am glad Dickey's characters, Kim and Jordan, did what they felt was right. Dickey made his details clear and expressed his ideas very well but he could've left more things to the imagination. Overall it was a good book because it was iteresting and realistic."
2,Hated it!,"The only reason I give it 2 stars is because I love EDJ's book. I am a strong BLACK woman in love with a strong BLACK man. Personally I'm not big on the whole black/white dating for the simple fact that no one can understand a black man like a black woman and vice versa. Don't get me wrong I'm not racist I am just tired of us being described as loud, ignorant, and less than other races. For a black man to write something like this is totally disrespectful. Not to mention the ending was way off. Come on EDJ. Where my girlz at."
1,Eric - You Really Let Me Down!,"this book is the worst book I've ever tried to read from Eric Jerome Dickey. I've read all his books, but this one just truly STUNK! I couldn't even finish it because it was soo boring. Eric should just gather up all copies and bury them. Oh for anyone wondering, this one is from BEFORE he began using million dollar words lol."
1,INSULTING,Milk in my Coffee was a book club book so I had to read it or pay a fine. Otherwise I wouldn't have finished it. I've read all of Mr. Dickey novels but this one was insulting to me being a black woman and a supporter of black writers. Personally I'm not for interracial relationships but why was all the black women so ghetto. The characters were not real. I did not like this book.
5,Very Entertaining....,"This is the only book I have ready by Mr. Dickey and I thought of it to be very entertaining. He showed a more sensible side of interracial relationships that people tend to wonder about. I was wondering if he's planning on writing a sequal to Milk In My Coffee, maybe something like ""Shaking my Mocha""."
1,Skip it!,"Written by a single author with no children of her own, I found this book to dole out extremely permissive wishy-washy advice that advises parents to coddle their children and permit poor behavior. Very new-agey, progressive nonsense!"
1,Skip it!,"Coming from a woman who has no children of her own, I find it very interesting that she considered herself expert enough to write a book. Most people giving out the advice on children, don't have any of their own. I thought this was a wishy washy endless diatribe for the permissive, new age parent. Lots of psychobabble nonsense that believes children should control their parents and we should sit back, smile and analyze..Save your money!"
5,A Frustrated Uncle,"My sister got divorced about 8 months ago after an 8 year mariage and two children. She has been on a dating frenzy, leaving her children with sitters and relatives. I know she's upset and scared but the kids are going to and are paying. I got her this book totry and help her be more sensible. She didn't listen to me or my parents who came off like lecturers. But the stories of so many parents putting things together after a break up has made a dent in how she considers what she's been doing. It's good to have a book with other voices. A video would be great."
3,"Run, but not with scissors, to buy this film.","Oh my God!! I felt embarassed at how funny this film is. I mean it's just gross at some points (the toilet scene), and I'm still laughing. This is an honest and direct look at what guys do after girls leave a party."
4,Great perfoemance ! Bravissimo !,"I always waited for this CD. I have been listening this No. 8 performance from 40 years ago, when I was a high school student. SONY didn't release this CD in Japan, so I was looking for this CD for long time. As you know, we Japanese can't buy any new CD from US Amazon. But this item was sold on 'Market Place'. I was really exited.This performance is really great and the Cleveland Orchestra is perfect!! In recent years, all orchestral recordings are recorded in live performances. So, technical problems certainly exist even if in major orchestra. But this performance is a session recording. Szell was a great 'Bruckner' conductor and his performances were virtually flawless. This performance is the fruit of ""Three Perfects=Session recording, Orchestra, Conductor"".But in this old analog recording, there are some random tape noises (not ""His"" noise). Remastering was not ""Perfect""."
3,A rigid approach in dated sound,"Szell belonged to the so-called Toscanini school of conducting that claimed to obey the letter of the score and demanded precision execution from the orchestra at the expense of flexibility, songfulness, and free expression. As such, he was an acclaimed maestro, given that no one could discipline an orchestra and get it to play more precisely than Szell.Today most of his recordings have fallen into the bargain bin, as this one has. No fault in itself, but no great sign of confidence on Sony's part, either. Bruckner asks for the very things Szell obliterates from the score--there's no nobility or spiritual yearning here. The orchestra plays with razor sharpness (something Bruckner doesn't really need) and the sonics are thin and wiry. As an example of what Szell wanted to do with tis composer, I guess this is a valuable document, but for no other reason."
3,Where is the romance?,"I'm sorry but there was absolutely NO romance in this story except for the secondary characters. It was more like a 'see what a great person Clarissa Beaumont has become' biography. I got tired of it really. By the end, I could have cared less what happened to her. Sinjin deserved a better story than this. I felt I never really understood how they fell in love in the first place. I would have given this a two if not for the wonderful writing and repeat performances of the characters of the previous book. But for those who read the first one...Clarissa? Good? Really????? Come on......"
2,Too much religion,"I ordered this because I heard a review of it on NPR -- with lots of Cash's singing included. This package contains two CDs. The first one is wonderful, is like the review I heard, with a variety of wonderful, interesting sohgs. The second one is ALL religious songs, which were no part of the radio segment. I'm saving CD number one, tossing number rwo.P.S. I don't know what ""Label this review..."" means (see below)"
3,Personal File Review,This 2CD set is for hard core Johnny Cash fans. The quality of the mixing is marginal with the guitar often being less audible than I would optimally prefer. On the first CD JC sings some great old folk tunes. The 2nd CD consists entirely of renditions of spiritual tunes and reflects a much more personal side of JC. This CD set requires having a taste for Johnny Cash without any of the fancy trimmings. But in the right mood this can also provide an incredible listening experience.
2,Keep it to yourself....,"I'm a Cash fan, and have many albums, but this was a disappointment to me. They say everything on this album was previously unreleased.... I think there is a reason for that. If you're a diehard fan with his entire catalog, then you'll probably want to pick this up, but to the average Cash fan, save the $14 for something else."
5,Do yourself a favor,"Get this CD set. There is absolutely nothing like it anywhere to my knowledge.Johnny Cash gives us insights into his inner self with these commentaries and songs. I had not heard many of these songs and he had, of course, not performed many of them publicly. After all, this is personal stuff that he recorded for himself and, perhaps, his family.These performances (if you can call them that) made me cry and made me laugh and made me think hard. I was a fan, but not a devoted fan of the Man in Black, so believe me when I tell you these performances are the essence of 'extraordinary' and a not to be missed experience."
3,Yellow not soft enough,"I like the putty in general, but it isn't as soft as what the physical therapist is suggesting for my regular osteoarthritis exercises. I like the 6 ounce size for the full hand workout. It pops during the workout, then the bubbles form when stored in the tub. This just creates more fun for me. I like the putty for not being sticky. I will try again for the tan to see if it is soft enough."
2,"At 1st, I LOVED this hand putty, but it doesn't last","This hand exercise putty is absolutely addictive, and a lot more ""satisfying"" and fun to use than mechanical spring exercisers. But -- and this is a real deal breaker -- it doesn't maintain its firmness over the course of a month of daily use (one or so hours per day); the putty becomes far too soft.I've purchased three of these Thera-Flex putties (6oz each), and even the FIRM resistance putty becomes gooey and sticky after four to six weeks.A real shame, because I really loved the product, but I just can't afford to buy new putty every 30 days..."
2,Way too firm,I'm sure this putty would be fine if you had very strong hands and just wanted to keep them that way. I would call it Ultra-Firm Resistance.
3,not the best,"I just got this in the mail today and I'm not too impressed. After using it only one time it is already starting to dry out. It doesn't let me pull and strech the putty out like it should, instead more often than not it breaks away when I'm pulling, as if it were cut with scissors. Therapy putty should never simply break away this way, the only way to split it should really be to pull until it streches thin enough to seperate/rip apart... What this is doing to me is just as I start pulling it/working on grip strength it will break clean away/apart when it is still 1 inch thick, usually sending my arms flying with the sudden release in tension. This should not be happening with this type of putty, and I'm scared that I'm actually going to hurt myself because of how this product it breaking apart while I try to use it.Other than what is mentioned above the resistance provided by this product is spot on and just were it should be."
5,Great alternative to play dough,"I bought Thera-Flex Therapy Putty for my four year old son after his teacher instructed me that his fine motor skills needed to be improved. She suggested letting him use play dough but he makes such a mess with it and he becomes disinterested quickly. I had never heard of this product before but I love it. It makes absolutely no mess, doesn't stick to clothes and he loves it."
5,Lovely and different,These are beautiful; they are tall for the dishwasher but they should probably be handwashed anyway. Shipping did great - they arrived in perfect condition. I love the shape and weight.
2,antiquated marketing thoughts,"I heard this author on a financial radio talk show (Bob Brinker) and the few things he had to say were interesting, to the point and powerful enough to make me buy the book. Should have quit with the talk show. If this guy is still building a new and successful business with flyers and Magic Marker posters he should read a little Ries & Trout or Seth Goodin (Purple Cow). We ARE in the 21st Century. We have the internet along with carefully focused radio and myriad other ways to reach people and mold thinking. There was nothing in the book that was not merely a stone cold rehash of old, old thinking. I was very disapointed. B. McDonald"
3,A Trip Through Post-Soviet Russia,"Based on a 2003 paperback copy.The Taste of Dreams: An Obsession with Russia and Caviar... The author may be equally obsessed with each, but she spends a lot more words on the ""Russia"" half of her obsession than with the ""Caviar"" half. It's an interesting read mostly concerned with the author's experiences in post-Soviet Russia. Caviar makes recurring cameo appearances, but it hardly deserves equal billing with Russia in the book title. I don't regret the $7 I spent on a used copy and the few days it took to work through it, but don't take the plunge here if you are looking for a 275-page treatise on sturgeon roe.Best line in the book (paraphrasing): If you are asking whether or not caviar tastes good, you are missing the point."
4,"Interesting, but tragic account of the decline in the Black Sea fisheries","I am a Russophile and found this book about the caviar business in Russia to be interesting, despite the tragedy it describes. The stories are compelling and clearly told by someone who knows Russian culture well."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I thought The Millennium Project was a great read. I was happy to see that it was a sequel to Code:Alpha, which I thought was one of the best books I've ever read. I really like the characters. Both thrillers were non-stop action and I couldn't put them down."
5,Entertaining Action/Thriller,"Massucci's ""The Millennium Project"" is an entertaining action/thriller in which a powerful businessman plans to wreck the world's financial system under cover of the Y2K bug. There's a lot of sex and bloodshed, but if you can get past that you should enjoy it."
4,"Okay, but. . .","Not a bad work, but not really all that unique. If you're looking for something really rivetting, I recommend the best novel I ever read, THE LAST DAY, by Glenn Kleier. Clive Cussler calls it one of the most intriguing stories of the decade, and he's not exaggerating. Impossible to second guess, and impossible to put down. Very provocative novel."
5,Kudos!,"I started the book last night, and I actually considered calling in sick today so I could stay up all night and finish it. It's been a long, long time since I've been so engrossed in a book!"
4,Looking for something different?,"If you're looking for a ""Kabbalah 101"" book, then this is not the book for you. Rosenberg does a wonderful job of explaining why the Kabbalah is, not what it is. This is a book of mystical truths and archetypes. His interpretations are insightful and provocative. A must read for the seeker of the non-traditional genre."
3,too small,"This is totally my fault for not paying attention to the posted size. I thought these would be longer to use as top roping anchors. Not really, they're a little bigger than wrist size. Well, good addition to my rack... but not what I needed."
3,"A Fun, Informative Grammatical Abortion","There's really nothing to the book at all (I read it in two hours). Poor english, repetition of the same story multiple times, and no real flow to it at all.However, if you're curious about mafia life, this is the book to let you know what is, and what isn't real. Pistone dispels several myths and ads a reasonable amount of relatively unknown info as well. Subject matter is fascinating, but he could have used a co author."
2,"Tired material, dubious delivery","If you read Donnie Brasco - or know even a little bit about the prototypical wiseguy - you do not need to read this book. It essentially details the way mobsters live their daily lives, what's important to them (money), why they kill people (also money), etc. If you have a brain in your skull you could have gleaned that from Pistone's first book, or the film Donnie Brasco, or any of the Godfather movies. What's worse, the book is littered with profanity, something that was missing (or at least not gratuitous) from the Donnie Brasco book. And it also surprised me because when you see Pistone interviewed, he seems like a class act. The profanity seems highly contrived as to make you think Pistone has more credibility if he talks like a scumbag."
5,"NOW, JUST A MINUTE HERE...","Strikes me that some reviewers are missing the point, but that may be in part because this book hasn't been properly marketed. This isn't another revelatory mob rehash, and it doesn't purport to be. Instead, it's a sharp, all-encompassing, witty and (dare I say) ultimately profound commentary not just on the mobsters' lifestyle, attitudes and mores, but on human nature itself. Parts of it are funny- -  hilarious, in fact; parts are breathtakingly cruel. But the big question this book raises is whether wiseguys (even undercover ones like Pistone) are better or worse than the rest of us- - or if they simply represent what the human animal is, stripped of all the frills. I'm a writer, and I loved this book. So does everyone I know."
4,Donnie Brasco,"If you haven't read a lot of books on the Mafia and its members, this was a pretty good one. Not much detail on the workings of the mob as an organization, but more focused on the individual characters in this one family and how an undercover cop brought them down."
4,Excellent Story Telling,"Way of the Wiseguy provides an ?if these walls could talk? perspective that is unique and fascinating. Most books I?ve read by someone from the inside tend to gloss over the gory details of events. Pistone tells it like it is. While some of the stories he tells are quite humorous, suddenly there is that element of ?wow, this was real.? The CD just brings it all together. You hear the voice of Lefty talking about ""official business"" and its very chilling and exciting at the same time. I must admit that i am glad there was a transcript of the CD in the back of the book because sometimes Lefty mumbles a bit."
1,thin and weak,"There isn't a whole lot to this book. Several 1 page chapters and blank pages. You can get a lot more information in other books. I loved Donnie Brasco, but this seems like a cheap way to get a quick buck."
4,It's Bakra Bata. What else needs to be said?,"It's not their best choice of songs, but Bakra Bata would sound good if they were just trying to beat their way out of a shipping container."
4,Good Scifi Epic,"Good book, I'm enjoying this series. Looking forward to the next one.Positive - good sense of adventure, the author helps you feel the scale of the lightly populated world.Negative - there is a litte too much recap between chapters... I think the previous book was a collection of short stories was this one as well. A little distracting but still a good story."
4,disposable sheets,"We have an older family member who uses ostomy products. These sheets are a very convenient way to keep things clean. they will fit nicely on a twin bed, although not big enough to ""tuck in"" the sides."
5,Delicious Recipes,Love this book. If you want to prepare traditional and delicious Maryland seafood I recommend this book. I am a native Marylander now living in Georgia and I know a good crab cake. The recipe for crab cakes on page 24 is one of the best I have tried. Love it!
4,very enjoyable and interesting,"I bought this because a friend had a copy. I found the story of a life on Snith Island, to be interesting and accurate. It provides insight to the hardships of Island living around the Cheasapeake Bay. Some of the recipes are deliciousand Mrs' Kitching's is a real person from the island. Very enjoyable!"
3,Crab cakes,I was a little disappointed. I wanted an authentic crab cake recipe and there was not one in the book.
4,Pretty good,Only problem I have with this is when coming out of hibernation it often needs to be unplugged and plugged in again in order for it to aquire. Otherwise quite happy with it.
3,Protein Amounts per meal,"My need is more protein per meal, and these menus give meinformation plus ideas for meal planning -- being able tohave info on menus from 20 to 46 gr protein per meal is abig assist towards being able to actually do it."
4,un dvd que no puede faltar,"Recomiendo ampliamente este titulo, es un dvd que no debe de faltar en la coleccion de cualquier melomano en especial si se trata de un admirador de los grandes pianistas del siglo XX. tiene un gran valor agregado al contener diversas grabaciones historicas de Cziffra. Lo unico ue se podria pedir seria que uviera un mejor manejo de camaras para apreciar de mejor manera la técnica del pianista, sin embargo es loable el esfuerzo hecho en aquella epoca para capturar el sentido mismo que Cziffra imprime en la interpretacón."
3,If Sabla Tolo (1) didn't exist Sabla Tolo 2 would get 4 Stars,"Definitely 3-4 stars, but Sabla Tolo #1 is much better. That's a 5-star percussion CD with great Dumbek playing (and other percussion). See my review on Sabla Tolo. Better yet, just buy Sabla Tolo #1 -- you won't be disappointed: whether you like percussion in general, the dumbek specifically, or like to bellydance."
1,Needs work. Simplistic and amateurish. Go back the board.,"""If you don't have time to read, you don't have time to invest."" Give me a break! I am constantly amazed that these so-called ""independent investment advisors"" think that the average investor can reach financial independence and multigenerational wealth without the aid of a well-trained, compassionate and skillful financial advisor. The average parents today are so busy with careers, businesses and family there are probably 3 or 4 seconds left at the end of the day to do any reading for pleasure, let alone financial reading. In Ms. Fisher's world, most of the baby boomers of today would never make it financially since they should not invest because they don't have time to read. Take care of your clients and don't give us any more advice."
4,An enjoyable introductory read,"A nicely panoramic view of the Lord of the Rings, that begins lines of exploration many casual readers may not have thought about without getting too deep or technical. A quick, easy, and enjoyable prose. Like a survey course, the text sometimes provides more questions than answers, but without leaving the reader feeling cheated or deprived. A very readable introduction."
3,Dry as Death Valley Sand,"This book is remarkably dry. Considering the subject matter I would've thought that was impossible but Michael Stanton has proved me wrong.The writing is dull and workmanlike.It's very much like a literary text book.The best thing I can say for Elves, Hobbits and Wizards is that it gives the casual Tolkien fan an almost encyclopedic view of the characters and ideas of the books.If you are planning on writing a term paper on Lord of the Rings this is a useful reference text but if fun is what you're after, pass this one by."
2,image deceiving,"I purchased the double swans to commemorate the birth of twin grandchildren. The image of the swans is not as clear, however, as pictured."
4,A lot of good music for the price,"I generally like the performances on these CDs. As an introduction to the Op 76 quartets, I certainly recommend these as a can't-go-wrong set, if, like me, you can't dive in at 14-15$ a CD to get a first feel for a piece of music. These quartets are the most interesting Haydn compositions I know of."
1,lame,"hated this movie, had problems watching it online kept breaking up, wouldn't recommend this to anyone crappy movie! Sorry but my standards are high for movies about wwII,"
5,Family Interest and Research,My family has a copy of 'Frank Matsura Frontier Photographer' because my grandmother moved to Conconully in 1902 with her family and then married in 1905 and remained there for some time. My mother was born there. Possibly some of the old photos of my grandmother and grandfather in their courting days were taken by Matsura - but at the very least they knew him. I also found several of Matsura's postcards in my grandmother's belongings when she died. The book is marvelous and I have shared it with my family; and have been curious to know whether it is still available in case we want another copy.
1,Shchedrin's score ruined.,"Much as I wanted to see Plisetskaya and the Bolshoi dance ""The Humpbacked Horse,"" this version was definitely not the way to experience it. I already loved Shchedrin's score before buying, some years ago, a VHS of this Kultur release now on DVD. Imagine my horror on discovering that Shchedrin's music is drowned out by a voice-over commentary. It's a disservice to one of Russia's most talented composers. Why on earth the commentary couldn't have been provided in titles below the screen is beyond me."
2,Good telling of Russian folktale but not a great ballet.,"A Russian folktale made into a movie/ballet/drama. This is not a well made movie but still quite enjoyable telling of a story with lush costumes and ballet accompaniment. Not a great ballet movie, very dated in style and videography;however, the narration and comedic story help."
2,Interesting but...,"Always been a sucker for books about demons and angels.And although The Succubus does achieve to get around a lot of mythological stuff - it is just still a mish mash of a novel that's not exactly sure where it wants to go. The author is close to getting it right - but unfortunately he makes a mess, by obviously not having his facts right. Chronologically it is well put together, but the author seems to be in a hurry and so the suspense loses momentum and the book finishes with a rather awkward and silly ending."
5,Conan for AD&D 1st edition,"Conan Unchained! is an AD&D; (1st edition) module for character levels 10-14. It is set in Robert E. Howard's world of the Hyborian Age, and is designed for use with four pre-generated characters: Conan, Nestor, Juma, and Valeria (though other characters can be substituted). The adventure itself pits the characters against an evil magic-user who has taken control of a Turanian city.As a real bonus, this module contains information on running a campaign set in the Hyborian Age. Rules are given for ""luck points"" and fear factors. Also, information is given on the use of spell casters.This module is absolutely a masterpiece. It is very well written, and has a lot of ""goodies."" If you can get this work, then do!"
5,Perfect!!,"Great product, beautiful colors! I bought 2 and will certainly be a return customer. Great job on shipping Amazon! Thanks!"
1,bad deal,"I bought this item from Essential Apparel and it arrived late and with 4 holes in the sleeve. I returned the sweatshirt but had to ""eat' the return postage, so, out nine bucks, and no sweatshirt..."
5,Amazing Sound for Price,I put this flowmaster muffler on my 93 firebird and it sounds amazing! For the price this is a great upgrade from the stock sound and it looks great to have duel exhaust. If I were to upgrade I would probably go with either an SLP or Borla exhaust though since they have a deeper and more throaty sound.The inlet size on the muffler is slightly too large for the v6 93 Firebird so you will have to get some extra pieces to make it fit correctly and I would recommend a good weld on top of that.
5,Well worth the price.,"These chimes are very loud, you will definately be able to here them inside your house. Their sound is beautiful and wonderfully tuned. The craftsmanship is of high quality. I would definately recommend them to anyone looking for a really nice set of chimes. They would also be great as a wedding gift."
1,Product Not Sealed,"I was so excited to find an organic/natural lip balm with SPF in it. That is not an easy combination to find. However, when I received the item it was not sealed at all - the cap easily came right off. In this day and age, manufactures can't take any chances that their products can be tampered with, especially products that are intended for the lips and will be ingested during normal wear (eating, drinking, etc). Love the concept but Kiss My Face needs to rethink their products for consumer safety."
5,Great book,The book is easy to use. It has many tools to help the students learn English. I will definitely use this book for the next three years.
3,Recipes can be a little hard to follow.,"This otherwise wonderful cookbook has been fouled by including two sets of instructions for each recipe: one for food processor users and another for hand kneaders. They are intermingled in a way that makes it very difficult to follow the recipes. The problem could have been avoided by setting the special food processor instructions off in a little box or maybe by using italic type. As it it, I have to go through each recipe before I begin mixing and carefully strike the paragraphs that do not apply in my circumstance. Two books might have been the best bet. It keeps me going back to my old, worn ""Beard on Bread""."
4,The ultimate bread baking guide,"After looking through this book, I felt I found the ultimate bread baking guide. Not only are there a ton of great recipes, but there are other tips, techniques, and problem solutions I've never found in any other book on bread baking. My only complaint and it's a mild one at that, is the lack of pictures. But then, I'm a picture person. The directions could not be plainer even for the beginner. I was so pleased with it, I sent a copy for my sister in Texas. Patrick McGowan/Escondido"
5,Nearly as good as the original,"If you can't get your hands on Clayton's original ""The Complete Book of Breads"" which came out in the early '70s (I've had mine equally long), this is a good second choice. While updating the methods with fancy kitchen gadgets, such as food processors, Clayton still remembers those of us who do it all by hand. Although his original is still my favorite, I've made many excellent breads from this book and don't bother with anyone but Clayton anymore when it comes to breads. In addition, it's well written and, with Clayton's innocent sense of humor, a pleasure to just sit down and read."
4,My new Bread Bible,"This is my new go-to book for bread baking! It is such a wonderful companion. I am relatively new to bread baking, so was worried it would be too advanced, but it was so clear that it wasn't a problem. I can tell I am going to find this useful as a novice and as a more experienced bread baker."
1,Run away!!!,I got his croissant recipe from Ochef. If you (Can)follow this recipe is reads and follows horribly. The croissants were ok but definitly not worth 6 hours. What a joke! Anything else but this!
2,What's a book without pictures?,"Although this book is extensive and well-written, it does not have a single picture in it. How are you supposed to know if you are making the breads correctly (or want to try them) if you do not have a picture of the finished product?"
5,A Treasure!,"I've made so many wonderful loaves from this book, but stayed away from whole wheat recipes until today. In the past, my whole wheat breads have come out heavy and tasteless - but today with Clayton's ""Sesame Nut Bread,"" I made the best whole wheat bread I've ever had! This man is some kind of baking genius and his 200+ recipes and shared knowledge are well-worth the price."
2,Horror Classics --- beginning to bore me,"I've only had time to view 7 or 8 of these 50 ""classics"". WOW --- I had forgotten how BAD some of these movies are --- with contrived/cumbersome plot-lines, low budgets, primitive special effects, poor editing, and questionable acting. Regardless, these movies are worthwhile from an historic point-of-view.I had seen several of these movies MANY years ago --- so viewing these again tends to bring back assorted old memories. As a result, I frequently smile --- while simultaneously grimacing at these primitive examples of film-making.Hmm... several of these movies (perhaps only the very OLD ones?) have assorted problems. There are a lot of jump-cuts... as if the original file-stock had missing/damaged segments. Some films have fuzzy video clarity. I've also noticed severe cropping on the edges of a few of these.Regardless, considering the low price, this would likely be a worthwhile purchase for most fans of horror-movies."
4,Horror Classics,"I am content with my purchase of the ""Horror Classics."" It took a little longer to get here than what I expected and I did not receive an email notice of when it shipped, which I kept looking for. But other than that I and my husband are content with the purchase. And the price was great.Sincerely,C. Fredrickson"
3,Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection,"I brought this set of programs for my husband because he love to watch old scary movies. I'm not a big fan of any scary movie, but as long as he has his (man cave) he can watch them all he wants. I watch a few with him and not all the films on this set are horror. Many films are included simply because they star actors who typically act in horror films. Films like ""The Bat"" with Vincent Price, or ""One Body Too Many"" with Bela Lugosi aren't really horrific at all."
3,Pretty Good...,"I only gave this a three because some of the films including can't be counted as horror. They have horror actors in them but they aren't horror. However, this set includes TONS of classics. Nosferatu, Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are just a few. I've had this for a few weeks and I still haven't finished watching it. Overall, I've enjoyed what I've seen. I recommend it ONLY if you're really into the older films."
4,Hours of chilling tales,"I bought this set for my husband's birthday and we have both been enjoying these classic horror movies, watching one or two a day (most run between 65-90 minutes, ""Metropolis"" is the longest at 119) for the past month. I am kind of sad it does not include ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", but there are many other great classics (""Nosferatu"", ""Bluebeard"") and not-so-greats (""White Zombie"" with Bela Lugosi, ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die""). Some of the special effects are laughable (the Killer ""Shrews"" and Attack of the Giant ""Leeches"") but I like the fact the movies were more about the suspense without being overly gory. ""Atom Age Vampire"", ""Dementia 13"", ""The Last Man on Earth"", the silent ""Phantom of the Opera"" and the original ""Little Shop of Horrors"" are favorites of mine. I agree the quality of the films is not the best, but this is a great deal to get 50 movies on 12 DVDs for less than the price of one new release."
2,This product is misnamed,"While this movie pack contains a handful of classic horror movies, most are cheaply made, poorly acted, super low-budget productions. Many look as though they were produced as a high school play and some are downright silly in their storyline, dialogue, horrible acting and laughable horror costumes.The audio quality on many of the movies is muffled and very poor; as though the movie is a copy of a copy.This movie pack simply does not deserve the name ""50 Horror Classics"". The price was inexpensive. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,A good buy for any horror fan,"SO lets start with the negatives: first off, my case was broken in transit, but it wasn't the sellers problem or what not and easily fixed with a bit of duct tape.Now that is over. here are the positivesAlthough not every movie is a winner, you are still getting a great amount of movies for a great price, i feel my money was well spent if only for Nosferatu, Phantom of the Opera, Little Shop of Horrors, and Night of the Living dead. and unlike the negative reviews that say there is bad film quality and what not, these movies where filmed on just that, film. before HD. the quality matches the time of the movies and is an excellent buy."
3,"Great show, besides for the resort preview disk.","This was a great buy with lots of really interesting movies. I was pleased with the variety of movies, and I still havn't finished all of them. However, two of the last disks in the bunch had been swapped with a resort video. Most unfirtunatly it was also one of the disks with House on haunted hill. I was very dissapointed."
5,Great collection,This has so MANY movies in it and although some are silent and more difficult to watch (unless you are in the mood!) the collection is WELL worth the money. I recommend it for horror classic buffs who like an anthology lying around when the mood strikes. Excellent!
3,OK!,"It was alright, but their hard to see through the one sided covers. There should be a clear screen on both sides of the holder's."
4,Awsome collection for the money,"I recently purchased this DVD set, I gave it the four star rating because the sound quality, and picture are kinda hairy,the picture I can deal with, but some of the sound on some of the movies is poor, and theres no extras and there's alot of discs and there double sided discs, but just for the movies that are on here it deserves four stars, there great horror movies and I plan on purchasing the other ones like this, all and all I say this set for the price is with out a doubt worth buying, great movies!!!!!"
4,Great Value for mostly Black and White Classics,"Really great value, 50 movies many classics Such as Metropolis,Nosferatu and Night of the Living Dead. Some really bad B movies that are also fun. Love this collection."
4,GOOD DEAL FOR THE MONEY,"THE PRICE IS DEFINATELY GREAT. BUT THERE ARE ALOT OF OLD MOVIES IN THIS PACK. BUT IF YOU LIKE THE OLD BLACK AND WHITE, THEN THIS IS THE PACK FOR YOU!! THERE ARE SOME REALLY GREAT OLD MOVIES AND SOME GREAT NEW ONES TOO. JUST WELL WORTH IT."
4,Great except for a few quirks,"I bought this collection recently and I am very happy with the selection. However, there are some oddities that subtract from the overall experience. My DVD player skips and freezes through the warnings and other introductions before it gets to the Menu. It makes loud noises and sounds as though it is breaking, which doesn't happen when I watch DVDs that weren't part of this pack. Another strange thing is that the DVDs are double sided but the movies on Side A are actually on side B and vice versa. I'm not sure if I just got some bum DVDs or if these flukes occur in all batches. Neither of the flaws are too terrible, and the movies are still quite watchable. I would just caution that there are some problems."
1,So-So,Poorly slapped into a package for the unexpecting horror movie fans. Never judge a book by it's cover. Read first.
2,Poor quality,I hate writing bad reviews but...I love classic horror movies and was really looking forward to getthing this set. However most of the disc's were scratched and unwatchable.
3,50 HORROR CLASSICS,"A nice selection of movies for the baby-boomers.Remember Saturday night scarey movies? Well, theyare all here, plus more. Facinating Silent films, as well.We are enjoying the variety of Horror Classics!"
3,"REALLY bad, campy movies!! However......","I bought this for my teenage son who enjoys horror movies. I was thinking more along the lines of more recent horror movies (1970-1980's), so when we saw the very old, very campy B movies it was not a hit at our house, so it was bad from that stand point. It certainly is not my idea of ""classic"" horror movies. HOWEVER, there are plenty of people out there that LOVE really, really bad B movies and I've got to say this is a 5 star pick for those types of movies. (They should change the name of this to ""50 really, really bad Horror Classic B movies you'll laugh at for days"".) I'm kind of in that catagory and was amazed at how much fun they were from that angle - there were some really pathetic movies in there!! So, hope that helps a bit with your purchase."
3,Nice collection. Poor quality with most of the older films.,"It is a great collection to have for the price if you're willing to get past the poor quality of most of the films, especially Metropolis. The formatting of some of the movies don't fit your screen so you lose some of the subtitles and parts of the shot are cut out on the sides. Grainy quality and poor sound."
4,"Cult movies , bad quality","All 50 movies are cult classics but the only thing bad is the sound quality, sometimes you just cant understand what the characters are talking about they should at least put subtitels, but thats not a big problem because the movies are fantastic.It realy pays to have this movie pack!"
3,So bad it's good (kinda),"Had a problem with one of the 12 discs - a movie wouldn't load. Amazon was great - promptly replaced it and paid for shipping back of damaged set. Love you Amazon!As to the set of movies... I remember as a kid waiting for Saturday afternoon's Chiller Diller. Loved those old B SciFi movies. These movies brought it all back. Some are good, some are bad, some are worse - however, 50 movies for the price is a pretty good deal. They are especially good if you are viewing with friends and enjoy critiquing/laughing as you go along."
3,"Lack of ""quality"" films takes away from ""Horror Classics""","If you enjoy ""B"" horror films, this is the collection for you! This set is full of low-budget, poorly acted, silly plot films from the 50's and 60's: Definitely ""late, late, late show"" stuff. In fact, most of these films are so bad, you probably would never see them on television today. However, that's the charm. Even though these movies are far from ""horrific,"" this is a valuable collection for the comedy value alone!"
1,????????????????????????????,"not what t expected very few ""horror classics"" most of the movies should be in a ""murder mystery classics pack"" not recommended for horror fans"
4,Great Horrow Film History,This collection was truly full of great horror classics. The silent movies to the talkies and on were wonderful to view. The arrangement of the film gave you a contrast between the silent and the newer films. It is an awsome collection. A must have for the horror film collector.
4,some real stinkers! I LOVE IT,"I picked these up just before Christmas last year and have finally made my way through all of the films. First things first, some of these movies are terrible. I expected that. Being a lover of all things black and white and B movies, the horror classics included in this 50 volume set thrilled me to no end. If you love the old vampire films and spooky graveyards at night, this is a great collection for you. The DVD's are arranged in small envelopes and without the book in the front, you might get a little frustrated trying to find the movie you are searching for, but otherwise I liked it a lot."
3,Old Horror,"This is a fine, cheap package of movies if you like the old Black and White horror movies. Most are seemingly low budgetted movies, such as ""Attack of the Killer Shrews"" where dogs are dressed up in ratty costumes and puppets are used for close ups. I for one enjoy these types of movies."
3,Old P&W movies of Horror that are funny to see !,"Top of the classic P&W; Horror films such as The Last Man on Earth and the Little Shop of Horrors are amoung the best classics movies. This is a great collection that must be with your old all times favorite movies ever.The only thing that is missing is the captions 'couse some times the sound is a little hard to understand, but they still have It to captive your attention for a few hours."
1,Poor Picture Quality,"While this may look like a great deal, please note that the picture quality of many of these films is very poor. Some appear to have been filmed from a TV. recommend you pass on this ""bargain"""
2,Not as good as I hoped,"This series of black & white monster was Ok but it wasn't as good as I hoped.I thought there would be a couple of Frankenstein, Dracula or Werewolf moviesthrown in as well.But overall it was just OK.Fergie - Aussie"
4,"nice condition, fast shipment","I thought the dvds were in seperate thinner boxes inside the case, but they weren't. It still was nice."
2,"OK ""B"" type Horror Flicks but you can get them cheaper!","These are (Class-B) B&W horror movies. Some are silent with subtitles. I purchased this set used from a seller at amazon. The set was in good condition and the shipping was fast. However, I advise not paying the new price as in my opinion, these particular movies are not worth that much. In addition, after I bought the set, I have seen this and other horror sets for $7.00 in WALMART, brand new factory sealed."
5,Instant Classic,"I bought this box set for my mother-in-law because she loves old horror movies. She was so happy when she opened it and read all the names of the movies on the back of the box. She said a lot of the movies she hasn't seen since her childhood and had been looking for them. I am going to purchase some of the other box sets for her for the upcoming holiday because she really enjoyed it. I would recommend this to anyone, I mean for the price look how many movies you get!!!"
4,horror classics 50 movie pack,not bad if you like old movies you will enjoy it greatbuy for the price
4,Educational and Fun in One!,"Both my 5 year old daughter and my 3 year old so really enjoyed the crazy twisted images turning into a picture in the mirrored-glass. Coloring can sometimes be boring for my daughter, but the challenge of distorted, upside-down coloring captured her attention for hours.Highly recommend! Super fun and educational!-SR"
3,Watch the age,My 11 year old son thought this was pretty lame. It's probably great for younger kids though I don't think any kid 10 or older will appreciate it.
2,Flimsy,"I guess we're the odd man out here.We didn't care much for this toy at all. It was a Christmas present.The history of morphing pictures is interesting for certain.\This kit is absolutely not worth the [...]The cardboard box it comes in is not especially sturdy.You get some stretched out pictures and two pieces of thin metallic-like material.You take this little piece of metal and roll it and hook it together. Then you place the picture around this metal cone and color it.The novelty wore thin quickly. I could see where this might be fun at a party, if you only have two kids coloring at a time or sharing a picture to color, but other than that, make your own. Wrap a piece of tinfoil around a toilet paper cone. Cut out the center of a sheet a paper, well you get the idea. I would not buy this again, give it as a gift, or recommend it."
1,pritty poor!,"Ok, i started bass and i got this book, it is not worth buying! under any circumstances! it walks you though laim exercises, and has about 5 pages on the same scale (major) just in different keys! this is a very very poor book!"
4,Was It Worth It?,"This book was a very nice read. I haven't read an Allison Hobbs story since Pandora's Box..which I really liked. Insatiable was a nice book to read because it welcomed me back to Hobbs' writing style.Insatiable started out really slow but after about the hundredth page, the suspense and the drama kept coming! I was so mad at the women in this book I could scream. This was truly a story of obsession and vividly portrayed the reality that one can lose their mind to the point where they no longer care about themselves, their family, or their future. It was crazy. The ending had me glued to the pages. I would love for there to be a sequel just to quench my desire to find out what ultimately will happen to the survivors in this story. Nice read."
1,Whatever Happened to Originality?,"Originality would be nice here Ms. Author. This book is just another FATAL ATTRACTION with a touch of LIFETIME TV MOVIES type drama stories. 0 for originality. 0 for imagination. 0 for writing style. 1 for attempt because it must have taken you at least six months to write this story. Another thing. I am so glad that Amazon has changed its format of recommending books. I was SO TIRED of seeing your book listed under every AA author's book title as a recommended book. The marketing concept worked with me because I did get it and was highly disappointed in Pandora's Box. I'll know better next time. I rate this on the same level as ""My Daughter's Boyfriend."""
5,Enjoyable,This was a good book i really enjoyed it.kai Montgomery was really a mess!!! her character kept you interested i can say that much!!!
5,Very good book!!,Allison Hobbs did a very good job on Insatiable! I give it a 5 stars rating! I thought the characters where well developed and very interesting. I can't wait until Allison next book! Allison keep up the good work.
3,Not what I expected...,"I thought this book was okay...it was nothing like I expected. The book did started off slow but the middle of the book was really good. I was disappointed with the ending. This is the second book that I have read by Allison Hobbs and it was just like the previous book (One Taste) in that it seemed like she didn't know how to end it so she threw something together and just stopped it there...Overall, it was okay but I would not recommend this book to any of my friends..."
3,it was ok,the book was in good condition however it took over the guaranteed time to get the book but they sure did take their money immediately.
3,"Good, until the end.","I thought the book started off fairly decent. It kept my interest, though a little silly at times. I thought Kai's character was a little ""extra"".Having said that, I was completely disappointed with the ending. I felt Ms. Hobbs just threw together the last few chapters. I won't call it predictable, just disappointing."
5,Home Hearth,I love this heater! It is small enough for the bedroom and has incredible heating power. The heater is very quaint and actually looks like a real fire.
2,Light A Candle Instead,"Though attractive, this piece of equipment emits about as much heat as a small candle."
1,Disappointing!,"I bought this book for my kids on my kindle fire, and it doesn't work...there are double pages and pages with nothing on them etc...Very annoying! If your thinking about buying on Kindle Fire...DONT DO IT!!"
5,Easy to use!,I bought this based on a suggestion from my friend and it has really helped in my weight loss goals. It's easy to use and easy to store.
5,Does Exactly What It Should,I recently bought this body tape measure and am very pleased with it. It does exactly what I need it to do. I definitely recommend it!
5,Buy it. Period.,"I deliberated much after reading a lot of reviews. I decided to buy it, and I am glad I did. It works fine and I do not see any problems with it."
4,Myo tape body tape measure,Worked as promised and provided accurate readings. Just a little hard to use but not real difficult.
4,Navy Physical Readiness Program,As our Command Fitness Leader in Japan we are responsible for taping all of our staff members that do not meet our height and weight standards. These tapes although not perfect are significantly better than using the old stand-by tapes of old. There is not much to compare. These are the tapes that big Navy promotes as they are handed out at our initial training to run the PRT programs. I have never had a tape break on me as many of the reviews have stated. The only issue is the peg staying in place when you clicking the button to get the measurement. I purchased five of these and will continue to use them for the next year and a half.
3,A little confusing,"It took a while to understand how to use this tape measure, I still don't know if I am using it exactly right. But, hey for six dollars I can learn."
4,Good for measuring yourself,"This is a good tape measure for weightloss/exercise tracking of body parts. It's much easier to measure the circumference of your leg or arm than using a traditional tape measure. Once the platic end slides into device's slot, you need only one hand to press the retract button and measure. The only complaint is that the plastic end slides too easily out of the slot. For the money, it's a handy tool when measuring by yourself."
3,An easy one person solution to make body measurements,"The only downside is the retainer pin slips out too easily so it is not uncommon to have to repatedly return it to the holder to complete a measurement. A better design would utilize a tapered interference fit between the pin and holder so it wouldn't so easily slip apart. Other than that, it works as advertised and is easy for one person to use."
5,Great measuring tape,"THis is a good measuring tape. There is already an allowance of liek 1 inch as that white tip is taped at almost the 2-inch line. It feels sturdy and very light. I also like how it kinda locks, so I can take it off my body and not worry that I would lose the measurement. It works!"
4,it does its job,"what can you really say about a measuring take but i like it because it locks the other side in place, and it took awhile but my husband and i figured out that it starts a 2 inches so everytime you measure yourself im guessing you have to add 2 inches to it, because of the missing two iches on it???? well thats what ive been doing so i hope im right!"
1,Junk -- breaks after a couple of months,Notice how all the good reviews are from people who just bought this and used it a couple of times. Keep using it for a couple of months and you'll change your mind on how great it is. The reel will break. I've gone through two of these and both broke after several weeks. These are total junk.
3,MyoTape Body Measuring Tape,This product is adequate. Nothing fancy but does what it's supposed to do.
1,Worthless Product,This tape measure is a worthless piece of cr*p. It is nearly impossible to use - a plain old cloth tape measure would do the job 100% better & easier. I would never recommend this product to anyone.
1,Don't waste your money,This thing worked only for about a week or so and then after that the pin broke and that was the end of the tape.
4,Works like it should.,Been using this for over a year now. The tape is still in good shape and not stretched out at all.
3,Tape slips out easily.,"I really wish they'd added a better way to lock the end of the tape into the device. It slips out frequently, so measurements often take 2-3 tries."
5,Easy way to check your measurements,"This body tape measure is a very easy way to take your own measurements. It's inexpensive and easy to read the measurement ticks on the tape. I like the way the tape retracts back into the device, tightening up to get an accurate measurement."
3,"Close, but no cigar","I really like the idea of this product. However, I've found that my measurements tend to be slightly off. I think this is due to the curved surface of the dispenser - not all body parts have the same level of curvature, and if you are measuring a body part (i.e. waist or hips) that has a larger radius, the results will be less precise. Also, I've found that the locking mechanism still allows the tape to move 1/2"" after you release it, therefore causing results to be even less reliable. I really like the idea of this product, but it doesn't work as well as I had hoped."
2,"Great concept, poor execution","I know it is just a measuring tape, but when you are losing weight, you really want/need an accurate body measurement. With most measuring tapes accuracy is fully dependent upon the user, but not so with this little gem. Unfortunately it seems to have preset intervals at which the scroll mechanism will stop - about every inch or so. So getting an accurate measurement is very difficult. This is such a great design - if more money was put into the production it would be a very handy little item. I definitely would not purchase again."
4,Ingenious design,"The design of this tape is really brilliant. Anyone who is trying to lose weight should be tracking not only the pounds they are losing, but also the inches. Unfortunately, measuring yourself can be really awkward and it is hard to get accurate results, but asking someone else to do it can be really embarassing. This little measuring tape makes it much easier. You pull the tape out a little longer than you need it (the tape automatically locks in place), hook the little peg in the groove and then hold it against your body and push the button. The button causes the tape to retract until it is snug. Once you release the button the tape locks into place again. All you have to do at that point is slip the peg out of the groove and then look the markings. When you are done push the button again and the tape wraps up inside the handle. It is a simple design that really works. Anyone who is on a diet absolutely must get this tape. They will not regret it!"
5,MyoTape,"This product is great- it's nice to have consistency in my measurements, so that clients know when they're making good progress and when they need to bump it up a little. No more guesswork!"
5,Great tool,I highly recommend this item. It makes the job of measuring my clients much easier. Totally worth every penny.
1,Measuring not accurate,"Tape measure worked fine, but it started at 0.5-0.75 inches instead of 0, making it hard to measure accurately. Returned it and got my money back."
1,Awkward and Cheap,"This tape is a great idea, but the design is poorly executed. The little plastic cylinder on the end of the tape freely slides out of the main body. Therefore, the tape constantly slips out when holding with one hand to measure the opposite bicep. You know that's why you're buying this, so look for a better product. Perhaps one that spent the extra 2 cents to make the tape snap into the handle."
1,Horrible,I noticed that my item was defective. I noticed that it did not start at 1 but started at 3. When I tired it it broke. i was so disappointed. I wanted to return the item. but by the time I received it it was over the return time. I was so upset. I wish it would of worked for me because I would really wanted to like it.
2,SO WHAT NOW?,"THIS THING DIDN'T EVEN CAME WITH AN INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO USE IT, I NEEDED TO LOOK OUT FOR IT IN THE INTERNET."
3,It's a tape measure,"This is, essentially, a tape measure. I thought it might actually provide more information about my overall body fat and health, but...it's a tape measure.There's a little information that comes with it that has some charts that correlate height and waist measurements, but...it's a tape measure.Don't expect more."
3,MyoTape Body Tape Measure Review,This tape measure is a total 60 inches long and it totally fits my waist to a T and it doesn't get any longer than that size so if your waist is bigger than that then don't buy it.
5,I don't know how I'd make it better...,"It works as advertised, is small, easy to use, and a good value for the money. I found it easier to use than a standard 'loose' measuring tape. No complaints."
4,Measuring myself all day!,I am on a quest to somehow someway lose weight. I bought this tape measure because I know that any observed statistic will eventually fluctuate according to what you perceive. YES! This is law of attraction garbage but it has gripped its hold on me. I use this measuring tape and write down my body weight every day after I exercise. This consciously allows me to remember and know about my own progress. This tape measure is in one inch intervals which is okay but I would have liked a more precise measure. The handle is very nice and solid and easy to hold onto. I would buy it again.
5,Great little product,"Makes it easy to measure yourself for health reasons or to buy clothes in the right size online! Eventually the little plastic bit on the end of the tape measure broke off, but it's such an affordable product I didn't mind ordering another one right away!"
3,nothing amazing,just like a regular measuring tape. I do like the hole to attach the tape to for accurate reading. Worth the price I paid for it
3,good for body measurement,"The quality is good however when measuring anything else, calculation needs to be adjusted as it starts at about 2 inches to account for the loop."
2,Could be better....,"This IS better than a regular tape measure for tracking lost/gained inches on your body. BUT- it's a flawed design. It has a plastic pin at the end of the tape that you slide into a hole on the plastic holder, which would be MUCH better if the pin actually STAYED IN PLACE! Every time you tighten it, the pin pops right out. It's as if you need a third hand to hold the pin in the hole, and boy does it get frustrating. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned it! I'm looking forward to an improved design, because yes this is better, but not by much!EDIT: 8/3/2010...... I thought of an idea, MyoTape. Put a heavy duty magnet inside of the pin hole, and on the bottom of the pin. That will solve everything!!"
4,MyoTape Review,"Pretty cool thing to have, I'd recommend it over regular tape if you're looking to document your successes. Only problem is sometimes you get different answers, but the difference is less than half an inch. It's probably due to how tight/loose it happens to wrap around the site at that given time."
5,Does what it says on the box,This product does what its supposed to. I like it and it is well made and easy to use by yourself.
5,love it!,"Other reviews are accurate, but wanted to add, this item is great for self-measurement and ultraprivacy. Great for nonpercision measurement of waist neck and other areas of body."
4,Decent,"I got this for bra fittings. It's a lot easier to measure myself with this than my old tape measure. The little peg fits into the body, which is nice. However, I have had the peg hit my fingers while using the retract button. I've found it's better to hold the peg so you won't get hit. Overall, a good buy."
3,Works as expected but..,I'm giving it three stars as it's missing a inch and 3/4.I don't mind the basic math when I use it but it's not that hard to have correctly attached the tape measure.
4,Body Tape Measure,"I like this product.....""BUT"", its a pain in the but....specially the quick release button that is so sensitive. When your trying to take your measurments, you go to read them, hit the button barely and sucks the tape back up.....but other than that i am very pleased with this product."
1,starts at 2 inches,"My tape measure starts at 2 inches and 5 cm instead of 0! So when I am measuring anything, I have to remember to add back those 2 inches or 5 centimeters, which is not ideally how it should be working."
4,Great except 1 problem,"I am not sure if this varies between each unit but the myotape measure for me, does not start at 0, the number starts at 2inches at the beginning of the tape. So every-time I measure I always have to subtract 2, which is kind of annoying. Everything else is great, the pin though, I wish did hold itself a little better. The pin comes in handy when your measuring by yourself but sometimes it pops out when your really trying to get a perfect measurement. Other than those 2 flaws, its perfect."
5,Nothing more nothing less,This is nothing more and nothing less than what I expected when I ordered it. It is fantastic when i don't always have someone around to help me take my measurements! This is not anything fancy and its price is perfect. it is a great product
3,Works fine...kind of,"The product is fine, but for me, the tape starts at the 2 inch mark, so I have to subtract two inches from whatever I'm measuring. It's not a big deal, but it is fairly annoying."
4,Good product but the connector is too loose,"I like the MyoTape and have no regrets with the purchase. However, the connector sits in the slot too losely and frequently pops out, causing some frustration. I'll probably wrap a little tape around it to make it fit more snugly... though I wish the manufacturer had done this already. It has made taking body measurements much easier except for that one minor flaw."
2,MyoTape Body Tape Measure,Product was nice while it lasted problem was it didn't last maybe 2 months if that long before it broke. Wasn't happy at all with the quality of this product. It should have lasted longer.
5,great,"This is one of the best products I've gotten in a long, time.I Would recommend to any one. The wonderful MyoTape Body Tape Measure works great"
4,myotape does the trick,I purchased the myotape to record the body measurements of my Zumba Fitness class members. The myotape made it easy to get an accurate reading. It could be improved with a little reinforcement near the end of the tape where it connects back into the handle. I'm afraid this connection point will tear with a lot more usage.
5,"Great product, BEWARE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK! ITS LIES!","Bought this MyoTape despite the negative reviews because one person left a good response (i'm not going to duplicate it, its already been written. Go find it.) that detailed why all the nay-sayers were wrong. The tape measure works great, and I'm able to measure anything without needing assistance (I'm trying to bulk up muscle and want to keep track of my progress). To measure my neck, I did have to stand in front of the mirror though. Overall though, this is one of the best, if not the best tape measure's to measure oneself with."
3,Not bad for what it is...,"I bought this tape because I wanted to keep track of my weight and measurements while on the H.C.G. diet program. I feel the handle gets in the way of trying to take a measurement. And I never know when it will decided to lock on me so the tape doesn't dissappear. I can still use it, but I would not tell people about this product, now will I buy it again."
3,Faulty design,"I've owned at least 3 of these types of tapes, and I think they need to take out a better design.I've had all the same problems people complain about, destroying the anchor at the end of the tape usually being the end of the product, so, in case you buy one of these, treat it gently, don't rewind it all at onceConcerning the MyoTape product, I found a new defect, the anchor didn't fit tight enough, making measures extremely uncomfortable, as the tape used to get out of the anchor while adjusting the lengthSolved it with some masking tape, otherwise, the tape seems very durable and I haven't had any problems in the last few months of use.They are cheap, so these issues are not a big deal"
2,Breaks easily,"Just a fair warning, its a decent cheap tape measure but don't expect it to last very long. Mine broke after 9 months using it about 1-2 times per month to do various measuring. The little white plastic cylinder at the end of the tape separated from the tape, making the device useless."
4,Good,I like this product but I do not love it. The snap in to make sure it stays slips out sometimes. I still use it and it is better than a regular measure.
2,The little pin keeps falling out,"I got pretty frustrated trying to take my own measurements using this tape measure before recently starting a diet. The little pin that holds the end of the tape fell out at least 3-4 times for each measurement I tried to take, even when I thought I was holding everything perfectly level. I really wanted to like this gadget but I was like, ""Come on, how hard can this be? Make the pin lock or something!""Anyway, I got the measurements I needed and will measure myself again in a month or so. And, more than likely, no matter how careful I am, the pin will probably fall out 3-4 times before I get each measurement. Which is fine, but annoying."
4,Worked!,I use it everyday to check the size of my belly :P. Even though nothing changed. So far everything is well with the tape. It is easy to hold and use.
3,not as good as you think,the tape measure tape doesn't stay in the locking area as well as you would think. every time I try to measure my results from the gym it falls out and is very frustrating!
4,Easy way to measure...,"I never checked the accuracy of this against a regular tape measure, so I can't speak to that. But it's a convenient way to regularly measure on a consistent basis. (FYI -- it's one of the easiest and most accurate ways to check your body fat percentage -- google ""military body fat charts"" to learn about it.) Some things you could do on your own with a regular tape measure, but this makes for easy, one-handed operation.Held up steady for a while, but when I was away my kids were playing with it and broke it, and I'm buying another one. I think that about says it all."
1,Nice Idea! wrong execution.,The device was broken even before I opened the package. The first time I pulled the tape out to measure I heard what sounded like a cracking noise and it would not retract the tape back in to its holder. After breaking open the case I found the reason very cheap metal was used and they didn't even wind the spring the correct way. Pure Junk!!!
1,Does not start from zero,"I had to return the tape because it does not start from zero but from 1 3/4"". Am I supposed to add 1 3/4"" every time I do the measurement? Return was handled fast with no problems."
1,inaccurate measuring tape,"Maybe I dont know how measuring tape is supposed to work but Ive always assumed that number would start at 0 then move to 1 then 2 and so forth. This tape starts at 2 inches. Go figure. Other than that, it's fine."
1,Bad Product,"I am in the process of sending this product back. The tape doesn't even start at zero! It starts at about 1 3/4"". How useless is that? I thought it might have been tucked into the little knob that was at the end of the tape, which you stick into the hole, so, I tugged on it and it fell off! Then, the tape disappeared into the housing! I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,"Sweater-vest, measuring tape and sombreros","I have found this measuring tape to be multifaceted and quite useful. For instance I tend to get secret pleasure out of measuring myself whilst donning my sweater-vest and handy sombrero. At times, however, I do find this product can cause a slight bit of chafing, that is when I turn to the ever soothing and convenient body glyde speed stick. All and all I find this to be a tremendous product, it really keeps me ahead of my weight gain and world domination aspirations. Highly reccomended!!"
1,Unacceptable product.. Do NOT buy for the lectures.,"Please be warned that if your are purchasing this product for Bernstein's outstanding talk on the first movement, do not do so. All four tracks are defective. To put it simply, it is as though you are listening to two people talking over each other in two different languages. This is a shame. I listened to this talk a long time ago, and it is wonderful. What a shame that you cannot do so on this CD.To reiterate, the issue is the lecture, not the music. It is incredible that as of May 30, 2007, this product is still on the market."
1,DON'T BUY THE TALKING TRACKS,"I should have read the reviews first, and I would have realized that the track marked English SUCKS. It's not the complete track, and it's French on the right channel and English on the left. What a frickin joke!"
2,Be Aware,The other reviewers who mention the problem with the wonderful Bernstein lecture on how the symphony was written are correct. All 4 language tracks are corrupted and present you with 2 languages spoken over each other making it next to impossible to understand and totally impossible to enjoy. Why no one has come out with a corrected CD version is beyond me.
4,Really a 3 1/2,"The mortifying moments at the beginning of the chapters are pretty funny, if slightly predictable, but unfortunately the rest of the book seems to go nowhere. It sort of toes the line, never really getting out there enough to be mortifying, and therefore, not as funny as I expected it to be. The writing was good enough, which is why I gave it a four, but the story, or lack thereof, was disappointing for a concept with such promise."
3,Run of the mill chick lit,"What a great concept for a book, and so when I started this I had expected to love it. Who doesn't love reliving someone else's mortifying moments? But while each chapter starts with a pretty funny ""moment"" the rest is just standard 'lousy boyfriend, bad job, oh my life is a mess' chick lit. The writing was good enough, but after a while I got bored. I'd try another book by the author, bu this one didn't do it for me."
3,not what it could have been,"I just finished this book, and I have to say I was disappointed in it. It just never seemed to GO anywhere and was bogged down by details that didn't really affect the main character. I was reaching the end of the book and was worried that Kerry's issues would not even be resolved. Then at the very last the author ties it all up in a pretty little bow - it just didn't work. The author never really got to the ""point"" of the story - it just seemed like there wasn't one finally.A couple of main problems:*Too much time spent on the problems of Kerry's friend.*Not enough time developing the characters that mattered.*No real storyline to follow, no climax or resolution - the character just plodded through to the end.*Addition of characters who had no purpose in the storySave your money on this one. It just wasn't worth it - there are better chick lit books out there."
4,For others who are changing careers,"Unlike the main character, my personal life is in order. But like the main character, I was burnt out of my professional life. I thought the writing and story was very insightful of the situations that come when you are a round peg trying to fit into a square hole.Very funny stories of previous run ins with the male species. Thank God, I don't have anything like that to look back on. You are routing for this character all the way through, and despite some set backs, you just know she will eventually get it right."
5,Funny!,"This book was hilarious. I'm in my 40's, but I still remember what it was like to be looking for Mr. Right. The author has a hilarious perspective, and I laughed until I cried."
2,Stick to Bridget Jones,"I expected a sweet and funny beach read. Unfortunately, this book turned out to be predictable and not too funny. The main character is obviously supposed to be an American Bridget Jones, but lacks her nerve and her humor. What we get instead is a weak heroine who spends most of the book feeling sorry for herself amidst ""single girl"" stereotypes- the interfering mother, the nasty boss, the gay friend, the good-on-paper-but-big-mistake boyfriend. The plot is resolved in a very formulaic and predictable way, and I was left feeling diappointed."
4,A funny book.,"I heard some really great things about this book, and when I was finished I was a little disappointed. I had huge expectations due to what I had heard.This was an enjoyable read though. I wish the ending would have been a little more clear. It was assumed what would happen with the characters, but not set in stone.All in all a great book. If you like chick lit or any comedy you'll enjoy this book."
3,If you really like chick lit.....,This book was entertaining but didn't go anywhere other chick lit hasn't gone already. If you like chick lit you will like this book.
2,Ball works great. Included pump is useless.,"I recently purchased this from a Whole Foods, hoping the convenience justified the slightly higher price. The ball is really nice.The problem with this is the pump they include. It is extremely poorly made. I started to pump the ball up, and the pump broke about 10 pumps in. The rubber gasket on the inside of the pump just came apart. Looking at it, I'm amazed more people don't have this problem.I had to borrow a friends pump, which was a Reebok pump with much better construction.I did email the firm, and they were responsive, but they said the only option was to have them send me another one of those same pumps. That's fine, but begs the question of why I would want another cheap pump."
2,clean,"Sorry to say, when I received the shampoo, it was a watered down product. I am using it, because watered down is better then none. I am disappointed in the vendor however. Pia"
3,A weak effort,"The first two chapters were typical of Smith's style and draws the reader in with the usual smooth flow, but then something happened and the rest just seemed too formulaic and predictable. This is only the third od The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency that I've read, and maybe I came to expect too much.Always great language and the writing is smooth but this time the plot just seems too overdone and the surprises that I had expected from my first forays into this series just weren't there. Not yet ready to write them off however and I'm sure his true fans won't either."
5,like a good friend,"I've read all of the books in the series leading up to this one and find I can't wait to pick it up again to catch up on the latest gossip, cases to solve, and to see what the characters are up to. Very comforting to read and feels more like I've spent time with friends than reading a book. Two thumbs up!"
3,"Charming, but not my favorite","This one was probably my least favorite of the series. It was charming, as usual. But, I really didn't like the turn of Mma Makutsi's character for the worst. Even though she is always a little full of herself, in this book, she went a little too far. I actually liked her character, so I was sad that the author chose to change her character in that way. Hopefully, it gets better."
3,the Good Husband of Zebra Drive,"For the series of books this one, as usual, was entertaining. However, so far the first three books were the best. Each book since has been left me just a little dissatisfied. He seems to be trying to develop the characters but I was comfortable with them as they were but I hope that Smith continues the series."
3,"Good, but disappointing resolution","This is the first book I've read in Alexander McCall Smith's well-loved series. I liked it very much, except for the resolution of the main mystery, involving the death of three patients in the same hospital bed at the same time of day; as a health-care professional, I find it extremely unsatisfying. I don't mean I dislike the solution to the mystery. In fact, I find it quite clever. It's what the characters do about the solution that sticks in my craw."
2,Smith is starting to Coast,"I am a big fan of this series and got this latest installment as soon as I could. It is the weakest of the series. I think Smith got lazy. Sure, you love the characters, but the tales are simply not up to his previous installments, not nearly as layered or workmanlike. I am disappointed he chose to grind out a paycheck this time."
2,getting a bit thin,"i have enjoyed almost all of the books in this series very much, especially the first ones, up to and including the book where precious and jlb get married in the last chapter. however i sadly need to say that this book and the previous one, blue shoes, are starting to feel a bit thin. as if he has sucked almost all the juice out of the orange, or like a piece of chewing gum that has been chewed so long it has lost its flavour. it just did not seem as interesting or as gripping as the first books, and also i had just read the internet ""joke"" about the patients in hospital all dying at the same time.....not very original or unique to botswana. time to say goodbye, maybe?"
4,"Lovely, as usual",This Mma Ramotswe book is simple and charming like all the others in this series. It does move the story along and those of us who read these faithfully feel like part of this family. I started this series because I have been to Botswana and loved it. But I have come to love all the small and amusing quirks of A. M. Smith's writing. But how much longer do you think the tiny white van can make it?
4,Just as enjoyable as the others,These books are little gems. This one is as good as the others and is a very easy read. Make sure you read them in order.
5,I bought the hardbound!,"After being an avid reader of mysteries I have left the genre for non-fiction and re-reading the classics. Seemingly it is difficult for authors to maintain freshness and quality in a series, (Christie, Grafton, Muller excepted) and when number eight or nine or ten is reached, the reading experience is often frustrating because little or nothing remains in the novel to remind one of why the characters and plots were once exciting, excellent and especially insightful.Not so with this author and this series. I bought the hardbound which is unheard of for me being a person who scours thrift shops and remainder tables for reading matter. I read it in one evening and was drawn into this gentle, ethical, sometimes disputatious, but never exploitative world peopled by characters who are like old friends with a few new wrinkles. Exceptional book.Marianne"
3,A little disappointed,I've always loved this series....usually didn't want to put the book down. This one just seems to be a little tedious and doesn't move quickly.
4,Good book in series,Another good book in the series. Enjoyed this one ore than some others as there were a few more things happening with the other characters than previous books. Enjoyable light read.
3,Like Revisiting Old Friends,"What's so remarkable about this series is that not only do you develop such a resonating bond with these wonderfully drawn characters, but you also feel completely transported to another place. His ongoing love letter to Africa continues to surprise and delight, and although it wasn't my personal favorite of the series, it was nice to sit with Precious and her gang for a few hours,"
5,Precious Series,I look forward to each new book in the series. The characters are charming and the descriptions of life in Botswana make you want to travel there.
4,Another Ma Ramatsche winner.,"Reading The Good Husband of Zebra Drive was sort of like getting a letter from relatives--I've read the whole series, and the characters all seem like people we've known for a long time. A recent trip to South Africa reinforced the cultural feeling. I much prefer this series to others by McCall Smith."
5,The Good Husband of Zebra Drive book,"I just love the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series. There is humor, facts about Africa and a different way of life. Always a great read. Mma Ramotswe is a wonderful, funny character."
3,The good husband of Zebra Drive,"Enjoyed the book, light reading, quick read. Not as good as the first in the series, though."
4,The Good Husband of Zebra Drive,"Recommended reading. It is a humorous story about the gentle and kind man who is husband to the head of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, woven in with the details of cases and training apprentices. The author does a good job describing details of life in a small town with humorous events that take place."
5,# 1 detective agency series,"I had borrowed the last in the series - The Good Husband of Zebra Drive from the library. When I had one disc to go, the audio booklet fell out of my car, and I didn't discover it missing until I had returned home. Was happy to find it on Amazon so I could get it back to the library in a timely fashion. Love the series - this one is no exception. Colorful charachters - fascinating mental meanderings especially poignant to me after a recent trip to Southern Tanzania."
4,"#1 Ladies Detective Agency continues, as with Mma and Rra!",I totally place myself in Botsuana as I read about these gentle people that have so much respect for each other as well as for the natural elements that surround them..I find myself wishing I could visit and share Bush Tea with Mma Ramawatse and Company..
5,Delightful read,"I have read all the books in this series. I enjoyed this recent book as much as the previous ones. I like "" escaping ""to a simpler way of life. Yet the book reveals wisdom for living that is applicable to my life. I recommend the book, even if you have not read previous ones in the series."
2,An Advertisement for E*TRADE,"This book was completely unfulfilling. It's hard to imagine a book that could be less useful for investors. Perhaps Costakos assumes that his potential customers are simpletons who don't know how the Internet works. Even so, his consistent proselytizing for his own online brokerage will annoy both neophytes and experienced traders alike."
1,Silicon Valley Journalism,"Self indulgent stuff, good advertising - bad reading. ""Jock strap"" journalism at its best."
3,Good for 2000 - But Now It's The Year 2008,"Most of this book is hopelessly outdated now (it was published in 2000), but I still found some of the book useful and interesting, especially the author's detailed and plain-English explanation of options and margin trading.Reading the book reminded me of how exciting it was to be around in the dot-com days, to be young and have so much information so easily available, with the click of a mouse. I miss those years."
4,Great for first time E*Trade investers,"This book gives you the nuts and bolts about trading and investing on E*Trade. It also covers investment tips and references to use, such as margin trading. The book does not tell you what to invest in but how to manage your own money. Great starter book for E*Trade investers and investors who think they know what they are doing but do not."
5,Great comparison,"This book compares the Lutheran, Catholic, and Protestant faiths. It start with what the three faiths are in complete agreement with, then moves to a section regarding views that are slightly different, and finally addresses things that are in complete disagreement.Very well-written and does not take sides. The author strictly states the facts and does not try to sway the reader one way or the other - a relatively easy read. I really like this book as a reference when people ask me, ""what exactly is the difference between Catholics and Lutherans?"""
2,"It's ok, but not one of the best in the series","We have watched most of the DVDs in the Scholastic Video Collection. This one was definately not one of the best. I would not recommend buying it. To my surprise, my daughter (4yo) did not even like the ""Diary of a Worm"", although she does like the book. I did like it. Anatole was also nice (we both liked it). I Lost My Bear was THE WORST and NOT appropriate for little kids. An annoying little girl with a very obnoxius sister... bad attitudes and the use of the word ""st*p*d"". One thing I recommend before buying these movies: borrow them in the library or rent them first. The extra movie (three legged cat) is in some of the other DVDs."
4,gorgeous,Recommend using a 4-watt bulb with it though as the 7-watts tend to blow fast. It is gorgeous while useful too. Recommend.
5,STUNNING,"This dragonfly night light would be stunning in any room. It casts a lovely pink glow everywhere that gives a soft and peaceful essence in the surroundings. It lights a larger than normal area and is easy switch on/off. We noted the colors were well done and very delicate. Also, there is a curved shape which gives it more dimension. My husband and I loved it so much that we ordered several for gifts and people are really excited, in fact, one sister said they were the prettiest she's ever seen. That was really important because we lost our daughter 2 plus yrs ago and the dragon fly is her symbol, also the water lily. When this came , it met all the expectations I was hoping for and them some. Thank you."
5,Beautiful and very comfy top!,"This top not only looks great on my little guy, but it's really soft! He has several Zutano clothing items and I've been really happy with all of them. This is one of my favorites because of how soft it is."
5,Unique Basketball,I wanted a basketball that wasn't as common as the ordinary brown ones. It is nice to have a different color on the school playground to end confusion on who's ball is who's. It has held up well.
2,"Red, white....and blue?","Balls are red and white only!!!I ordered 2 of these basketballs for my grandsons. I had bought a portable basketball hoop and even though I had some older basketballs in the garage I thought a couple of new ones for them would be a nice treat. I ordered these because the picture and the description showed red, white and blue. Shipping took a little longer then stated and they arrived the same day my grandsons where to spend the night. They were exited as they opened the box. The basketballs are only RED & WHITE. NO BLUE. I could have told the boys put them back in the box they are NOT what I ordered. No they were exited to use their new balls. So I pay for one thing and get sent something else. Pictures, descriptions don't mean much to this company I guess."
4,More Geo Trax fun,"My 3-year old son loves trains in general, and is obsessed with having his trains (or cars or trucks or anything with wheels) go through tunnels. So this was a great treat for him. We've got a couple of pieces of the Geo Trax world already, so this was just another add-in. It takes a little more effort to put together than the other sets we've bought so far, but no problems with it. We have a standard size train table, and adding a piece like this, or the elevated tracks (which we also have) is starting to push the limits of the train table. I guess that's an overall ""warning"" about the Geo Trax sets...if your kid likes them, the more you buy, the more space you need if you want to set up the whole thing. Our space is limited, so our son can only set up certain pieces at a time. And he is pretty astute to set stuff up himself. We may get him started by doing the initial setup, but he'll eventually take it apart and do a different track layout."
3,Mile High Mountain,"My 3 yr old absolutely LOVES his geo trax set and I have no complaints about any other part except this one. First off, it is huge and takes up a ton of space adding it to the set. And secondly, the mountain is so steep that we very rarely make it down the mountain without a derailment of the trains. Unfortunately for me, my son loves bridges and because this has one with it, he insists we use it. Just be prepared to set train back up after it makes its way down."
5,The best toy for any kid,We bought this and other geo trax sets for my 2 year old son. He rarely goes three days in a row without playing with it. The mountain is one of the funnest sets of geo trax. Even my 4 year old daughter loves to play. My husband and I enjoy making the track layouts. I'd say this is a toy for any age. I love that I never worry about it breaking its very sturdy. The only draw back is the more sets you get the harder it is to store. But that doesn't stop us from wanting more. It's the greatest.
3,"GeoTrax is wonderful, but Mile Moutain is not for us","We love the GeoTrax system. My son got it for Christmas 2 years ago when he was 3, and he still plays with it fairly frequently.The Mile High Mountain is the least-used of all our GeoTrax pieces. It is too hard for him to set up alone. Sometimes even I have trouble remembering exactly how to configure it. Once it's set up it, it works very well and is a lot of fun. If we had lots of room to leave the GeoTrax set up all the time, we would LOVE the moutain. But we keep our GeoTrax in several huge tubs, and build new layouts all the time. The mountain adds frustration and delays to the building process. It also takes up a LOT of room in the huge storage tubs, that could be better spent on a zillion more track pieces. (Son likes to make really long tracks and ""deliver"" stuff from one room to another.)"
3,"Love geotrax, but the mountain is pretty lame.","I have a couple of sets of geotrax that i build with my 3yo son, and the problem I have with the mountain set is that it goes up the mountain, but doesn't come down. This means that if I'm combining it with other sets, I can't complete a loop that goes up the mountain. And that means if you have the remote controlled geotrax trains and like your train actually going round and round the track, you'll be finding yourself trying to bend and mold the mountain pieces to come back down. Really they should have just included a few extra pieces to make a loop."
3,ONE BEAUTIFUL BUMMER,"I never saw a live performance of The Council, but my beautiful old Decca recording left EVERYTHING to the imagination. Enter this broadcast video from the 1960's. Oh boy! Is this depressing! It is grey and old and tragic and gut wretching without a single moment of melody or relief. I saw the video in one viewing and my wife and I shared stunned silence when it was over. My wife summed it up-""Oh is this depressing. It is an exercise in being bummed out"".My advice- if your love this score and libretto, stick to the musings of your own imagination. This is a gloomy old thing that is neither poignent or enlightening. It is a massive bummer of such magnitude that you might think you are watching an old Saturday Night Live sendup of video noir. I guarantee it will bum you out and never - and I mean NEVER be played a second time. The first viewing is enough to make you want to slit your wrists and take a nice worm bath. Eyow!"
4,Soulful Piece of Work,This 1993 release from Michael Bolton is not as appreciated as his previous titles such as SOUL PROVIDER. Yeah I feel it is not as excellent as those. Not as commercial for sure. But if you listen to this one by one still great music goes on.My personal favorite is SOUL OF MY SOUL fitting snugly with his vocal style. Dynamic power ballad I'M NOT MADE OF STEEL is also my favarote track. Michael Bolton is known by revitalizing classic hits such as WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN. On this album he made an excellent cover of Bill Withers' classic LEAN ON ME. AIN'T GOT NOTHING IF YOU AIN'T GOT LOVE also has the taste of pure classic pop song.Verdict: Still the nice Bolton work.Rating: 88 out of 100Recommended for every Sony's middle-of-the-road rock appreciator as well as Michael Bolton fans.
3,"Not his strongest, but...","Although this album as a complete work in my opinion comes nowhere near ""Soul Provider"" or ""The Hunger"" for that matter, this is still a consistent album, chock full of the commercial hooks that have made Bolton a pop industry success. I will single out 'Completely' as the finest song and the one that I can still listen to intently. The orchestration is beautiful and his vocals are very powerful and soulful."
1,An Insult to lonely people!,"i have respect for michael bolton, but that song ""You ain't got nothing if you ain't got love"" is an insult to all the lonely people who do not have a girlfriend or boyfriend. i'm a lonely person so i take this song to be an offense. no other singer sang a song like that. sorry bolton, but you lost a fan because of that insulting song."
2,Bolton bottoms out,"By 1993, Michael Bolton could do no wrong in the eye of record execs. Both Time Love And Tenderness and Timeless (The Classics) were #1 albums, and he was the biggest thing since sliced bread to housewives across the country.However, the release of ""The One Thing"" in late 1993 signalled a downturn in Bolton's career. The formula that was perfected on Soul Provider and was still successful on Time Love And Tenderness was running out of steam by this go-round. The only track on the album that scored was the leadoff single, ""Said I Loved You But I Lied"", which was a great record for him. However, the followup single ""Completely"" was stale and the Def Leppard-sounding ""Ain't Got Nothing If You Ain't Got Love"", the third single, was completely dated and unhip by it's release.The album did still sell decently though not in the league of his last couple albums, but it's also one of his poorest catalog sellers, Bolton did this one for the cash and without the heart."
4,Michael Bolton,"Michael Bolton has one of the most powerful and certainly one of the most unique voices the pop world has ever seen. This album was a wonderful example of what Michael can do with his voice. The songs that stand out the most is the heart wrenching performance ""Completely"" the soulful rendition of ""Lean On Me"" and the fun rock sound of ""You Ain't Got Nothin' If You Ain't Got Love."" This is Michael Bolton at the top of his game. Michael has shown his lasting power because he is still relasing music today and never limits his still broadening musical talents! A must have for any M. Bolton fan. ~Richard F."
2,Coffee in the attic,"This product seemed to do what I wanted when first received, but after about 2 weeks, it just seemed to fall apart, and now it is in the attic."
5,Great hose,"I purchase a new hose because I ran my old one over with my truck... Glad i did, this hose is slightly longer than my old one and has no leaks, thus the suction is much much better. The on/off switch it the best, my old hose had to be unplugged for the vacuum to shut off."
2,Kinky Hose,I cannot recommend this hose as it has a tendency to kink at every turn. The quality is just not there but at 35' and this price it may be worth the cost?
1,Not worth the money,"I had to buy this stinking book for a classs I was taking, it was so bad my Professor even said that it was bad, and she would never use it again. This is another one of those acdemic type of books that your professor forces you to read for class that absolutely goes no where with the point they are trying to make."
3,Art of the Japanese Sword,"I would have appreciated it more if I were a metal worker. I'm not sure what I expected when I bought the video. If you're looking for detail on the manufacture of old Japanese swords, it's a bit superficial. If you have a casual interest in that process, it's okay."
2,Below average for GGW,I was not impressed with Beach Babes 2. One of the first girls they show flashing at the beach is pretty hot. But from that point on is nothing more than barely average girls in my opinion. Also the lighting is very poor on the beach in this video. The camera guy/producer did a poor job overall I thought. There are lots of ethnic girls shown here so if you are into latin type girls you would definetly like this dvd.
4,Spanish and White girls,I loved this video because of the mixture of girls they had in it. Don't get me wrong i love white girls but sum spanish spice to it was a good touch. They need to make more with different races. Still got love for my white girls. buy this video especially for the price.
4,Einstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution,"This dvd has been converted from a tape, and the video quality is poor (very dark). You cannot skip forward or repeat content within a lecture. Although I have only watched about half, the content is very good. Professor Richard Wolfson is a good presenter and explains everything in an entertaining and very understanderable way."
2,Poor quality,"I bought this as a gift. I hope the recipient wasn't as disappointed with this product as I was. The pages are made of paper that looks to be newsprint. The words are printed HUGE, but it looks juvenile. It's not as thorough of a Bible dictionary and concordance as I expected. The cheap quality of the pages' paper was embarrassing to me. I hope my friend liked this gift okay. She never said ""Thank you,"" so I fear she thought I bought her some junk for a gift."
2,not appropriate.,"Too much dictionary & not enought concordance. Too confusing for the elderly person, for whom it was a gift,to use."
5,Support your local Farmer,"This is the best greatest hits compilation I've had the pleasure to listen to in a great while, maybe ever. As Jann Wenner says in the liner notes this dude walks it like he talks it. Being a former farmer myself, I appreciate the time and effort this man (along with Willie and Neil) has given to the American farmer. My personal faves are Love and Happiness, Walk Tall, Rain on the Scarecrow, Peaceful World, and I'm not running anymore.They put Tom Petty in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame but not Mellencamp? Give me a break. Tom is good, but Mellencamp blows his drawers off. You won't find a better bargain than this collection. Next time you eat that ear of corn, remember where it came from. Peace."
5,Greatest Hits of John Mellenkamp,"...nice and very good selection of his Greates Hits,this Guy is one ofAmerikas graetest Rock-Country Singer with an excelent voice for soft songs also...must be in every CD - Collection...."
4,"Any lover of music should ""Check It Out"".","It seems alot of artists in recent years have released a 2-disc collection that improves upon their older single disc ones, and that's just what Mellencamp has done here. Not only is the first disc alone longer than what was on ""The Best That I Could Do"", but this also obviously includes more than twice as much music. What pleases me most besides the addition of his post-1988 work here, is the inclusion of both ""Rumbleseat"" and ""Rain On The Scarecrow"" from his excellent 1985 album. In fact the only tracks I really miss are ""Play Guitar"", and the 1997 song ""Without Expression"" from the last collection. Otherwise this is all the great american rock a ""Mellen-head"" could want from this ""Pop Singer""."
5,A CD that is worth every penny you spent,"Over the years I have spent a great deal of money on CD's, many of which I listened to once and are now collecting dust on my CD rack. These 2CD's are an entirely different story. First of all you get 2 incredible disks for just a bit over the price of a normal single CD. Secondly, there is no filler... Mellencamp's music puts me in a really happy mood like no other music has been able to do in the past while... Favourite songs 1) Cherry Bomb 2)Hurts so Good 3) Authority Song 4)Jack and Diane 5) Pink Houses. I have a feeling these CD's are going to occupy my cd changer for a while... What it boils down to is that this compilation is better than any of the past 25CD's i've purchased. Buy it, you can't go wrong!"
3,How about a Greatest Hits DVD??,Mellencamp has alot of great videos for his hits but the bonus dvd here only has 5 videos. How about a seperate hits dvd like U2's 18 or a more generous bonus dvd like the one included in the latest Stevie Nicks greatest hits or the Robert Plant box set. Now those are well-made greatest hits dvds to get excited about.
3,review songs,There is a whole lot of songs in this album. There were many good signature songs that I enjoyed and got to know but there were a few songs that I did not want to hear again. I think I got more of my money's worth on this album.
2,Ain't Even Done With the Night?,"I have noticed, time and again, when searching greatest hits CD's, that on each CD, my favorite song is always the one that is excluded; in this case, ""Ain't Even Done With the Night"" was excluded. Wow! I'd like to know who puts these greatest hits compilations together and what in hell are they thinking!"
3,"sorry to say, I am a bit disappointed","This CD has a fair amount of relatively tame covers. I always have considered John's originality to be one of his great strengths. I did not expect a ""greatest of"" CD to have so many covers. To me it reduces the value and enjoyment of the CD. Check out the track list before you buy..."
5,Simply Awesome!,CD truly charts the artistic journey of John Mellencamp (first caught my interest as John Cougar in the early 80s). Usually compilations tend to be notorious for omitting couple of hits that left a sense of incompleteness and dissatisfaction. But Words & Music has all the songs that matter to any John Mellencamp's fans. It deserves a place in anybody's collection (and certainly worth your money!).
3,Does the job.....,"Item arrived as predicted. Wish there had been other ""flavors"" available, tho. The sweet pea is fine but wish it had a little stronger scent. But, it's nice.!!"
5,East and West,How interesting to read these reviews and observe that all those teachers who are familiar with the authenticity of Christopher Hansard's background & lineage approve. Yet those from the West question. When will they learn and how can we teach them to understand?
3,"Some good, some Not","I generally tend to think that much more is possible then we are willing to believe. So the story of this guy's life may have very well happened like that even though it does smack of charlatanism.As for the general message of the book I must admit it isnt the clearest document written on Tibetan Buddhism I've ever read. At times its down right jumbled and boarders on New Age-ism, other times it is able to produce a small gem."
1,Out of Print -- There is reason in the world.,"I purchased the 7th edition of this book in late 1999 for study of the April 2000 California Special Seismic Exam for Civil Engineers. This book claims to be ""A Professional's Introduction to Earthquake Forces and Design Details,"" but falls well short of any such description.While small parts of this book are useful, the theoretical discussions in the vibration and diaphragm theorey chapters are disjointed and incomprehensible. Often formulas are published without explanation or even defining the variables. The readings do not prepare you for trying the example problems and the solutions are not adequately described so that you can learn from the practice.Overall, save your money and check out a review book at the local library."
3,"Great table piece, doesn't tell the whole story","For Patriot fans the 2001 season was a fairy tale...thus it's hard to sum it up in an 120 page book with lots of pictures.But this book is still a must have...just for those classic pictures, and for Michael Felger's brilliant work...though he said the Pats were not as good as the Colts until after the AFC Title Game. But still the best writer in the City by Far."
3,pretty good reading,"Even though this book is not a scholarly approach to worship and liturgy, it is good and easy reading for Catholics who want to deepen their knowledge of some interesting finer liturgical background for the most important ritual in the Church."
3,alright,its alright. i was looking for something a little more theologically written but the fact that it was written mroe like a story made my other family members read it so it was a blessing in disguise! easy read with good examples to illustrate points but if you want something more theological then this is not for you.
1,im not an idiot,im not an idiot and yet i found this very difficult to use...... i think I'll get me one of dem electronic machines :p
3,"didn't receive item, but got full refund","after ordering this item, we were told it was no longer in stock. we did receive a prompt refund though."
4,great,"i really like it, its nice to know if you are losing (or gaining) body fat or lean body mass and this product allows you to do that not only privately, but also frequently."
2,Difficult to use,"I should have known that cheap plastic calipers wouldn't work very well. My main gripe is that you are supposed to squeeze the calipers together until you hear a click. Maybe my unit is defective, but the click is basically silent, and I almost always continue squeezing beyond where I should have stopped. I have resorted to trying to look at the calipers as I squeeze, although this is a little tricky. Tyring to stand up straight, pinch my skin, squeeze the calipers, and try and watch to know when to stop, all at the same time, is a little awkward and overwhelming. Would not recommend."
3,not the greatest,"I dont know if I'm just not doing it right, but it seems hard to use, and not very accurate."
5,"Assuming its accurate, worked perfectly","Assuming this is calibrated properly, it worked like a charm and we are using it for our entire swim team. Great product and well made."
4,A bit tough to get the hang of,"The skin-fold caliper is a quick easy way to assess where you are at regarding body composition. The trick is measuring at the same time of day in the exact same location every time. Results can vary quite a bit if you are measuring even an inch off the original measurement site. Consistency is the key to success. Also, how far you pull the skin away and how far down the fold you measure are important. It's best if you have someone else to do the measurement for you and if you measure and record data for several different places on your body. The guide only tells you one site, but there are 8 different sites you can measure from (just Google skinfold caliper measurements)."
3,may produce different readings,"The harder you press, the fatter you get. How hard are you supposed to press? Who knows?"
2,"Okay, I guess","For an overall, general picture of body fat content, this caliper works well enough. If accurate measurement is important to you, this tool made of lightweight plastic is probably not for you."
3,meh..,"i guess i need to read better, cause i didnt see that this thing was made of plastic...i thought it was a little more solid. i mean im sure they all work the same, but for $12 you should get a little better quality imo.oh well, it does work though."
5,Good way to check body fat!,"This tool does take a little time to figure out, but it's actually not that difficult. It is a good way to check your body fat in specific areas. Try not to pinch too hard. :)"
2,Basic fat tester,"I bought this product and it does have a measurement chart which is only based on abdominal fat, so the accuracy is questionable. The major problem I had with it is the so called clip which is supposed to stay at the measured level. Mine won't stay locked on, so I just have to check the measurement and release the whole thing."
3,Accu-Measure OK....,"I was a bit disappointed, as it is kind of flimsy, but I think it is good for personal use and gauging progress...."
2,Did not provide accurate readings,"This device works by measuring a skinfold with a small tab that ""clicks"" into place at the right tension and measurement. I used this 3 times and got consistent readings (that I thought were a bit low, but maybe they were right as I don't have a true recent measurement to compare against). After the third reading, however, the small tab required much less resistance to click to identify the right measurement and starting giving widely varying measurements.I shipped back and had no problems returning, so I would shop again from this seller as they stood behind the product. I fault myself partly as this is a very inexpensive caliper and you get what you pay for. I would recommend buying a bit heavier duty one for others."
3,Not an excellent product,This is a great value item at under $4 but it's hard to get consistently accurate readings. I've been using it for some weeks now with varied results. I wouldn't purchase this again...next time I'd come off a little more cash and go with one of the electronic versions.
3,Is cheap what do you expect!!!,"Gives you an more defined idea of body fat percentage and is about as good as your going to get for cost. It is plastic and wears out over time, also the click you are suppose to hear on my latest one does not click so I have to visualize the action, which can be done, however is not convenient."
2,Inaccurate,"I wasn't experienced with skin fold measurements when I was looking at this product and I thought it would be a cheap way around buying a real set of skin fold calipers. It's not. The tester relies on you applying the exact same amount of pressure at all locations each time you test, or your results will be skewed. Knowing the correct pressure is also a guess. I wouldn't recommend this."
3,A bit fiddly to use and variable results,"It is difficult to find the point on the body that you are supposed to use this on so you get very different results depending on where you hold it.Also, there are different points that should be used to measure body fat - depending on whether a man or woman is being measured - this doesn't address that."
5,Body Fat Measurement,"Recommended. Does what it claims. Made of hard plastic. Must take an average of 3 measurements to determine answer. Has a chart for various fat levels. Measures in inches and mm.Recommended for the average person and weekend warrior, not for Athletes. Make sure the lever is pushed all the way to the right (high setting) then test and listen for click or you will think it doesn't work. Nice product."
4,Pretty good tool,"This little tool saves you the money of having to buy one of those fancy measuring machines (that determine body fat, water content, etc.), although hardcore fitness junkies would have to get one eventually. It's very accurate, on par with most online ""calculators"" if not better, though it can be hard to understand how to use the thing since you have no idea if you are doing it right. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone looking to measure their body fat easily (after some practice, that is)"
4,As reliable as the reader,"The product is good. Mine stopped making the click noise on the first day I had it though, but you get the feel for it. I think the trick is to always do the same spot and be consistent. The price was the best I had seen anywhere. As long as you are consistent you can see a change. Good Luck."
3,"If you squeeze nothing, it still indicates 6 mm.","If you squeeze nothing until it clicks -- and I really mean nothing, just squeeze the air, so that the calipers are touching -- it still indicates 6 mm, and on the chart, this means you have 8%-9% body fat. My guess is this instrument is good if you are a bit chubby and need to track progress at the beginning of your weight loss, but if you are already lean to begin with, it won't be very accurate. (But then, if you're already that lean, or have reached that level of leanness, why bother to continue keeping track?). I started out around 12 mm, and after six weeks of exercise it went down to 8 mm, and four weeks later it hasn't changed even though my weight has continued to decrease and my activity and diet haven't changed. My guess is that there's a validity range to these calipers and it's out of range now."
2,Accue-Measure Fitness 3000 body fat tester,I have tried this several times and not sure it really works!! Either that or I'm doing it wrong... it is way different from the results I get from my gym body fat tester! Good luck!
2,Very hard to use on some body parts,"I found it nearly impossible to get a reading in the thighs, where there is a lot of muscle and not much loose skin.The 'clicking' feature didn't really work either. It is an inexpensive item, but the difficulty of using it, getting the exact same location every time, makes it something I won't use again. It isn't worth sending it back.I found the website another reviewer posted that you could post your measurements on more useful, just using a tape measure, and then it generates an approximate body fat percentage.If you are disproportionate where you store fat, it is probably more accurate than an impedance device, and there is some use to it for giving you rough information but not for extreme accuracy."
2,Don't be deceived....,This product looks like it's made of metal in the picture but it's actually made of flimsy white plastic. It isn't the most accurate device either. Save your money or get one of the better models.
3,accurate with a learning curve,"I still haven't been able to master how to use this device (the Fat Caliper) with any degree of consistency. I've had it about a month now. But my trainer seems to know exactly how to use it and gets accurate measurements with it each time. So apparently, once one has learned how to use it properly, it will aid quite well in measuring your body fat percentage. It's easy enough to read - but it's the actual measuring that leave a lot of room for error."
3,Cheap Quality and not easy to use on self,"I was looking forward to this item because I remember using calipers when I was in the Army.I find the quality lacking, and the click button is really hard to get a feel for. The ""press"" button hardly gets any kind of click on my unit so mine my be defective.Very cheaply made and I think giving it three stars was a bit generous. There has to be better calipers out there. But I guess as in most things, you get what you pay for."
3,It's okay.,I havent' been that successful using this but maybe it's just user error. I found the directions a little confusing but the product was inexpensive so I just took a chance with it. It works okay.
4,its good enough for the price.,You do need to watch a video or go over the directions a couple times to get a reading. Other than that its ok.
2,Unnecessary purchase,"I got this, because it was cheap. But even at this low price, you don't need this caliper. It's useless without a knowledgeable person accompanying it. Instead buy an electronic fat analyzer, even if it's not accurate, you can follow the fat loss/gain much easily."
4,Complicated,The instructions say where to pinch skin for measurement but I do not think they are entirely accurate. I have more to pinch in other areas so I do not see how it can be done properly. I think a professional is the best way to go.
1,cheap and not worth it,"There is no ""click"" as the directions claim to tell you when to stop the measurement. The directions describe a supra-illiac or whatever location for the measurement but the picture shows an abdominal placement -- who knows which they really mean? I guess if you just want to follow your progress and you are very careful in how you take the measurement, the product would be useful for that. It is not of use to determine what your body fat actually is however and it is difficult to use correctly."
1,Recieved the wrong item twice!!!,"I ordered this item twice, and both times I recieved the wrong item. For both orders I recieved the Accutape, and it took about a week and a half to recieve it. I was able to get full refunds on both items, but do not order this item because you wont get the right product."
1,Don't waste your time or money,Not worth the money. This thing is designed to take just 1 body measurement. I've never seen a caliper test that sampled fewer than 3 or 5 locations on the body. The instructions themselves even tell you it's hard to get consistant results. Worst part: Amazon charges you more for the return shipping than the product costs so you can't even return the junk.
1,Wrong Item. Twice.,I have no idea how good this product is because I did not get it. Twice I ordered it and twice I received the MyoTape instead of the caliper. Buyer Beware.
1,Not Accurate,"If you clamp it all the way with nothing in between, it reads 6mm instead of 0mm. How can this possibly be accurate? Then i tried using it to measure various number of pages in a book compared with a ruler and they were all waaaaay off.Im about 8% body fat based on looking at myself. If i use the caliper readings and the chart that came with it, i get 26%. If i use the caliper readings with the 3 point method, i get 14%. If i use the 3 point method and translate that into the actual distance compared to a ruler, i get 4%."
2,Cheap but still not worth it.,"You get what you pay for I guess. The caliper is made of cheap plastic, the readings can vary greatly depending simply on how much pressure you apply. The is a small button on the left hand side of the caliper that is supposed to ""click"" to let you know when you have pressed hard enough. The button was out of alignment with the caliper on the one I received, you almost have to bend it to get the button into the slot. I tried using it a bunch of times but I don't have any real faith in the measurements I'm getting with it. This one is a bust."
4,Easy and reliable,"I found the calipers extremely reliable after only a few ""test runs."" Knowing my body fat percentage helps me to keep track of where i'm at in loosing fat and not just loosing weight."
3,Not sure if this is accurate at all.,"This caliper, by their system had me at a MUCH lower BMI and fat percentage than other systems, so I have no way of knowing if this is even remotely accurate."
3,its ok,For my husband he seems to like it and its easy to figure out and use. Strong plastic for what little I paid for it.
1,doesn't work.,Very inaccurate and useles.. Dieting is hard but with the proper will power the wieght will come off along with the fat. Measure how much fat you lost with a pair of old jeans that hasn't fit you for ages. God Bless and good luck.
4,Product is good. But expensive,The quality of the product was good..I was not happy with the price..
2,Not for bigger people.,if ur overweight u have to calculate it yourself. im just using the BF measurement on my scale until im small enough to calculate it on my chart. im a full time student and i really don't have the time.
3,Godd for casual use,"For the once in a while use it is OK & inexpensive. The real question is why bother with this toy? Isn't a scale and tape measure for your waist enough. But then again ""to each his own"". I quess if it motivates you to improve your body than it is definately worth it. So why did I buy it? I had nothing better to do. Also, I bought it along with the MYOTAPE which is more useful. Both items along with a third item qualified the order (over $25)for free shipping. Great way to get people to buy what they don't need."
3,Don't Use It Unless You Know How,Using these tools take experience. Most of the time people pinch the wrong way or wrong area. This OK but there are better ones on the market. Learn how to use it before you buy.
2,You get what you pay for.,"The calipers worked well for the first couple of weeks (10 uses or so), but the ""click"" feature is now broken. It was only $6, though, so I couldn't have expected too much. I would recommend getting something sturdier than plastic."
4,Most accurate self test method available,"As an amateur bodybuilder, knowing body fat percentage is very important. But not everyone can afford a hydrostatic weighing or knows trained caliper users. The Accumeasure is easily the best method for reliable body fat percentage readings and is easy to use, durable (I've dropped it several times already and it still works fine) and cheap.For best results, use body fat % formulas that require 3-7 skinfold sites. The more sites, the more accurate the readings. Good luck everyone and SQUAT LOWER."
2,"Ok for the price, not great","For the cost, it's not bad, but the ""audible"" click that you are supposed to hear when taking a measurement only worked the first 2 or 3 measurements (plastic wore away maybe?)."
3,"Um, what ""click""?","I never got the click sound it promised. I had to look down at the device to see when it was nudged in the little compartment...and using 1.6 in. of skin/fat and 1.7 in seemed to give different results, at least in the hip measuring area. This device just doesn't work well enough."
2,accumeasure 2000 body fat caliper.,"Not impressed with the item at all. It would have been better if the readout of the measurement locked into place on the scale, so that I could get an accurate reading, and then release it afterwards. The way it currently works is that it releases from the scale when I try to read it after a measurement, due to the change of my hand grip pressure. I would need a second person to read it in place, to get an accurate reading without taking my hand off of the caliper."
4,Good product,"Cheap, fairly easy to use, gets the job done. Just don't use the directions given. They only measure stomach fat which isn't an accurate interpretation of overal body fat. Go to ehow.com for a more advanced way of measuring."
5,"Easy, accurate and cheap!","These calipers are the easiest, most accurate and cheapest way to measure your body fat percentage. Make sure you do it at the same time of day and not directly after exercise (I would suggest the morning.) It come with directions that are helpful and it was easy to use!"
3,"For the price, it is fine","It is a cheap, easy, quick way to take your measurement. I still haven't be able to be consistent though. However, it seems the little arm off to the side that clicks in at the point of measurement quickly became misaligned so mine doesn't easily ""click"" like it is supposed to. I would have to have someone else perform the measurement since doing it one handed is kind of cumbersome for me. But I wouldn't expect more for the cost."
2,Not very accurate.,This device is not very accurate. I can measure my fat 3 times in a row and get a different measurement every time I do it!
3,not super accurate,My husband and I just competed in two body building shows and we had to track our body fat percentage. This worked well but I think the digital reader is a much better fit for what we were doing.
2,Don't let the cover fool you.,"While this is an excellent tape for beginners in that he walks you through the BASIC steps very slowly, the cover leads you to believe you will be doing the ""cool"" moves featured in the now-famous Gap commercial. I'm sure it is no coincidence that the cover picture shows couples dressed in the familiar tan pants. I applaud his teaching style, if not his advertising. Advanced dancers, or those wanting to be, stay away!"
4,Do you know what you're eating?,"I read Seeds of Deception prior to reading this book and subsequently found Ms. Hart's work to mostly review of what I already knew. Some of her interviews brought new faces and personalities to the stories of protestors and farmers embroiled in the conflict.It amazes me that with all the evidence and scientific uncertainty surrounding GMO's, America still does not have labeling laws! Pass this title and others like it along to your friends and family. Know what you're eating!"
5,History personalized,"This book, written at the beginning of the 1900's, looks back to a period right after the Civil War, and it explores topics that are still evolving today and will keep on evolving - race relations and relations between men and women. The author explores what happens when people are defined differently by themselves, by society, and by those close to them. It's fascinating to read this book in all its contexts - of today, the era in which it was written, and the era it covers.It's also a poignant story of dreams and gentle hopes crushed by society and by the unfeelingness of others. I found it a sad book, but also a very thought-provoking one. It has something to say to us today, though it treats another era."
2,Not for everyone,I have tasted other soy pasta and have found some to be as satisfying as regular pasta which is why I committed to the money saving and convenient large quantity offerred.I would advise anyone else to reconsider this method of purchase. This pasta has a taste and texture that I was not pleased with. On its own it is not too bad but it is certainly not a substitute for regular pasta. I am now stuck with a dozen boxes of this product since it is sold through Amazon and grocery items are not returnable. In this case each box is packaged seperately and is sealed and yet I have to keep them all.
2,Not what I expected,"I really did not find this book very helpful. There were a few helpful hints but for the most part, it was pretty much common sense. I didn't find anything of substance from it. I found it pretty general and not very insightful or detailed."
5,"deep thoughts written in polished, gem-like prose","Eva Hoffman's book-length meditation on the Holocaust, written from her perspective as a daughter of survivors, is beautifully written. Her well crafted sentences reveal the careful thinking she has done as she ponders how her generation, born into sunny safety after the horrors their parents had known, has viewed those events that cast a shadow over their parents' lives.Hoffman is highly intelligent, well educated, with broadbased understanding of the atrocities, the loss and the uprooting, the courage to begin anew, of those who emerged from the camps. She perceives the ambiguous borders between victimhood and dangerous resistance, the fateful choices her parents faced on a daily basis.Her book is a highly valuable contribution to a world where conditions of genocide still exist."
4,Great selection,"Some of the movies were too dark in places, but over all........watching them was lots of fun!"
1,Subtitles,In the product details they say subtitles are available. But unfortunately not. Since I am unable to enjoy them all. Producer should update the Product Details ASAP.
3,"For what it is, not too bad","I ordered this collection at the same time as I ordered 50 classic musicals, most of which were unbelievably terrible. I watched the musicals first so was not expecting much from the mysteries, therefore I was surprised to find some cult classics and a few halfway decent films with noted actors at the start of their careers or in atypical roles. Not too bad if you take them for what they were meant to be: class B productions churned out in a few months time. Don't spend a lot on this, however: most of the films are just a small step above the current tv sitcoms. And don't bother with the 50 musicals collection unless you just have to see famous singers, mostly black, at the start of their careers. Some of the scripts and the acting are embarrassingly bad."
3,What a Bargain!,"At less than a half a buck a flick, you can't complain too much. There are enough gems in the batch to make it worth your while. Don't expect any extras, of course."
4,Best of the box sets,This is actually the best of the Treeline/ Creek Mill box sets as it really contains some classics which are hard to find. The quality is amazing given the price. The quality of the picture varies but I usually find the sound most difficult with old movies and that is surprisingly good. So if you're a film buff: this is one collection worth buying.
1,Mystery Classics had some interesting films but the condition of the discs was poor at best.,"The movies in the set were fine but the condition of the discs was terrible, not to mention that not all the discs were sent. The discs were dirty and scratched, not to mention that some had chips."
2,not what I expected,"yeah, I like these black and whites. it has some good movies but not the famous or known ones. I would not recommend.then again if you are an old movies junkie you might like it."
2,too old,"these are really old movies -- 30s and 40s, so the image quality is very poor. I'd say go for other options unless you're into those old movies."
5,For lovers of old movies,I loved the old movies I watched as a kid with my mother. Rememberthe syncopated clock at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. Anyway this isa very nice collection. Many I have never seen or heard of butam looking forward to watching. The quality of the dvds issurprisingly good too.
4,Mystery Mania,We lost our vast collection of old mystery and horror DVDs to fire- this volume is a good start toward replacing some of our favorites. I look forward to collecting more volumes of Mystery Classics
4,Oldies but goodies,"The sound may be scratchy and the light and shadow areas fade in and out, but Bulldog Drummond and Sherlock Holmes will live forever. I have thoroughly enjoyed these blasts into the past and don't mind the above mentioned flaws. For the price they can't be beat. I own several of these 50 DVD collections and find gems hidden in each and every one. I don't even mind that my grandchildren say, ""The Shadow, who?""."
5,Great Old movies,"I Love to watch old movies and I was surprised at how many of these I had never seen before. The movies are of very good quality, especially if your used to watching some of those really old black and white movies. If you're into older mystery and suspense movies these are worth getting."
2,Mostly Public Domain Garbage,"To be fair I've only seen a fraction of the movies on this set. I found out about it a day after I bought a ""film noir collection"" and an Edward G. Robinson collection which yielded 5 of the films included here. I netflixed a collection that included three more to see wheather I should chalk up not buying this set as a mistake and try to get what ever I could for the set I had and buy this instead. Now I'm glad I kept the nine dollar difference. ""Impact"" ""Second Woman"" ""Scarlet Street"" and ""They made me a Criminal"" are awful. ""Too Late for Tears"", ""Kansas City Confidential"", and ""The Stranger"" are OK. ""He walked by Night"" is barely passable. I sort of wish I could see ""Suddenly"" because it sounds interesting, as do ""Quicksand"" and ""Jigsaw"" and I definately admire ""Detour"" if only for its strict adherence to noir conventions and its creative manuvering around the Hayes Office's provision that the bad guy must be punished."
3,Keep looking,"This book is fair. It's great for a coach moving up to club levels. Where they need to know team management motivation, etc. But if your looking for rules, tactics, techniques: It's lacking."
1,Noe shorts,They run very small i reccommend u get a bigger size when ordering i could not give a review on its uses it didnt fit me too use
5,For older kids who aren't parrots.,"I read this as a child (it was one of my favorites - quite short and consistenly enjoyable). Since other reviewers have already provided the major plot points, I'll leave that out. Let me just say that I didn't read the story as a ""how to poison your grandmother"" instruction manual. It taught me not to try and make medicines on my own - you can't predict the results. I suppose, looking back on it, it's really an anti-drug/huffing parable. The first time you do ""the medicine,"" you feel huge. The effects shrink thereafter.You can probably gauge how impressionable your child is based on whether they try and feed you some medicine they made themselves after reading the book. If they do, depending on how successful they are, you might look into censoring books like this that require them to think."
1,Horrible Role Models,"George's Marvelous Medicine is full of characters who lack character. George is mistreated by his grandmother, so he resorts to doing something mean to get back at her. When George's parents get home his father is overcome by greed and helps George recreate the medicine. They fail and make a shrinking potion instead. George's father encourages the grandmother to steal and drink it. The obvious theme is revenge. I do not believe that George intended for his grandmother to vanish completely, but he certainly wasn't sorry for what he did and neither were his parents.Not one person ever demonstrates the qualities we want our children to possess. My children won't be reading the book."
3,Macabrely Plagued,"I allowed my little ones to read it before reading the reviews. Simply put; I thought Roald was very cunning in writing a book that clearly outlines a deranged family on many levels. He delved further in disguising a crime of murder. Without going into much specifics, I think parents should think more than twice about allowing their young ones to read this without at least giving/getting afterthoughts of all who've read it. It's interesting to see what comes from the mouth of babes after having read something like this skittish little gem ."
4,Great Medicine,This book was good. Some parts were funny and some parts got a bit serious. It was just good to read really. The medicine gets muddled up with other ingredients and it ends up being George's Marvellous Medicine 3................
3,Devilish Fun for Tweeners!,"Some books are good reads for children as well as adults. This particular book isn't one of them.There were a number of things I didn't like about it. My most harsh criticism would be that I found it boring and predicable. ((And I won't even mention the that the idea of using household toxins as a ""medicine"" for grandma got my mom antennae twitching. Can't help it, it's an occupational mom-hazard.))But this is just how the book struck me as an adult. And I'd be remiss not to mention that my 10 year-old daughter thought was great. She thought the drawings were very funny, and she got caught up in the story so that we read the all of ""George's Marvelous Medicine"" in one day.So THE SKINNY is that this is an amusing book for young folk, but not so much for adults-- at least not this one. The writing is good. The book is an excellent Read-aloud. The reading level is 4.0.Pam T~mom and reviewerbooksforkids-reviews"
4,Georges Secret Ingredients,1.) Its about George who makes this medicine to make his grandma dissapear. Instead with all his chemical ingredients she grows super tall. Then his dad comes home and gives it to the animals to make them supersized. George makes a second medicine to give to her and somthing weird happens.2.) It was pretty good because of the suspension between George and his grandma. Also it was interesting how he makes the medicine.3.) Suspence is a good story element to describe the book because you wander what will happen to the grandma and want to know what he uses to make the medicine.4.) I gave it four stars because it's a funny book and interesting for a quick read. So anyone could read this book with any taste.
4,another fantastic book by Roald Dahl,George's grandma is horrible. But smart George cooks up with a way to CURE his grandma. But things go wrong and.......buy the book and you'll see why i recommend it. It's a favorite!!
5,Georges Marvellous Medicine,"This a book about a little boy called George. He lives with his Grandma(who is really a mean Girl.)His Mother has gone to do some shopping. Grandma shouts at George.She orders him like mad. So George thinks of making Grandma a medicine. He puts Animals Medicines,Soaps and things like that. And at 11 o clock the old Girl shoots up in the air.Because she trank the Medicine."
4,This book was the only good thing about the second grade!!,"I had a terrible second grade teacher, Mrs. Borwegan, (whose name was even evil). The only good thing she ever did for me was to read George's Marvelous Medicine, which taught me that books can be silly, and little boys can get away with justifiable homicide. To this day, this book remains in my library, its purple cover appropriate to the regal literature inside."
4,How I rated George&#65533;s Marvelous medicine,Have you ever had a rotten relative that you would like to get rid of? Well this is the book for you.Hello!My name is Natasha. I read the book George's Marvelous medicineThis book is written by: Roald DahlThis book is wonderful. It's about a boy named George. George has a grandma that acts like a wicked witch. Throughout the book George tries to make medicine that would make his nasty grandma be nice.I really like this book because the author describes the medicine and the characters and what happens to them so well that I could picture it in my mind.I recommend this book to kids who have wild imaginations and like to make pretend potions.
5,"Marvelous ""George's Mavelous Medicine","If you love Roald Dahl, this audio CD revision is a must. Richard E. Grant brings George, his grandma, and his parents along with the animals to life in true storyteller tradition. The voices make you want to sit back and enjoy the story in all it's glory.Being unabridged you can follow along with a copy of the book un-hand. And it makes a great bedtime story that parents and children can enjoy together."
3,Pig and the Shrink,"My review is about the book called Pig and the Shrink. The main character is Tucker Harrison. Tucker needed to win the science fair project to get into the Math and Science Academy School next year. His experiment was on a weight loss program. He used Pig, short for Pighetti a classmate who is the largest kid in school. During the experiment, Tucker and Pig become friends. The experiment didn't work out very well and Pig was gaining weight. Pig wanted to stop but Tucker was obsessed to win. So obsessed, he lost Pig's friendship. Tucker realized that Pig's friendship wasn't worth losing over a science fair project. He also realized that even though Pig was big, he shouldn't have judged him by his appearance. Pig was a great person inside and out. Tucker apologized to Pig at the science fair and decided to drop out. I recommend this book by Pamela Todd. It teaches a good lesson about friendship and not to judge people by their appearance. It was fast paced and funny."
2,Too Much Informatin,"I have many Network+ books. This one in particular has a lot of information other books do not contain. However, this is way too much information for a Network+ book. The information in this book would be well suited for a book on ""In-Depth Networking"". Yes it can help you with the Network+ exam, but almost half of the information in here will not be needed to pass the Net+ exam. I have even written to the author and was told this book was written with ""The learned in mind"". I would say you need at least 2 years of Networking experience to fully understand the concepts in this book. This book is not written for beginners, so I have to say its not a very good book to prepare you for the Network+."
3,Average at best....,"This exam will be replaced by a newer exam in July. Regardless, I was hoping for a book with some in depth knowledge (right to the point) and maybe some practice questions or a CD...something.The only questions are the end of chapter questions. Not really too helpful and narrow in scope.What really annoys me is the useless information. I promise you that 25% of the material I've read has a disclaimer at the end of it that says ""Oh,by the way, you really don't need to know this..."" or ""this isn't covered on the exam..."". Unfortunately, the author tells you this at the end of the section you've already wasted your time reading. I'm wondering how much more will not be on the exam that I've wasted my life on."
3,When is an anthologizer not an author?,"I purchased this book believing it had as yet unread stories by my beloved professor, Charles J. Calitri, only to find that it is a collection (and a very fine one) of stories meant to be used as a high school text, with most stories followed by a poem appropriate to their meaning. I am merely rather disappointed, having believed it to contain more of Calitri's work; to list Jennings and Calitri as ""Authors"" is surely misleading."
3,Magnet Therapy Works,"What the authors say in regards to the differences of the two poles of each and every magnet, is based on the research of Albert Roy Davis and Walter C. Rawls. Davis was the first scientist in the world to discover that magnetism consists of two separate and distinct energies, not one.Some of the information is not completely accurate in this book. It's a decent book, but I'd recommend buying a book by Davis and Rawls."
4,my first introduction to magnet therapy,I did enjoy this book as it was my first introduction to magnet therapy. This is a topic that I intend to explore much further too. It was very helpful and gave good information.
1,not a good copy,"I would have liked to have known that every page was written and highlighted on, there were lines drawn and words circled and it is not very readable. It was in very used condition and not good used condition as described."
4,A great work.,"Without a doubt, this is a very good work. Nee's ability to expound on various passages concerning authority, submission, and obedience is superb. Beware though, there are a few statements Nee makes in this book that need to be further examined, and may be in error- but probably are not.My only complaint about this book is that it is highly repetitive. You will read many of the same statements over and over again, but that's because this is simply a collection of sermons/essays by Nee. He did not simply sit down and write a book.Also I find it of interest that Nee doesn't make very many personal references/examples in this work. Had he put more of his own experiences in this work, you would probably be reading John Bevere's ""Under Cover,"" which is remarkably similiar to this book."
4,a must have,I was very happy with this book. It gave great information as to the way we are to view authority. it has caused me to change the way I think about leaders
5,Spiritual Authority,"This is a must read for those that believe in Jesus Christ and the Bible. Written by a man under persecution for his faith, imprisoned and still wanted to get the message out to help other believers. One of his best works, an easy read and full of enlightment."
2,Chinese culture creates a barrier,"If taken literally, the arguments are problematic. However, I loosely accepted Nee's argument that God demands our obedience to authorities that are consistent with His authority. That is, God intends for us to follow our leaders as they follow Christ, as Paul write. God did not intend us to mindlessly obey leaders such as Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot, and so on."
3,Basis for and Qualifications for Authority,"For any Christian who is looking to be discipled in the ways of Christ while wary of the danger of submitting to the wrong authority, this will be a good book to read.For those Christians who are serving the Lord in various capacities and meeting opposition and rebellion, the Old and New Testament examples given will not only bring much comfort by showing the faithfulness of God to those HE has called, but will also serve as a reminder that God will not be mis-represented and that abuse of authority is not tolerated regardless of provocation."
4,I great lesson on what AUTHORITY really means!!!,"To me, this is the best book brother Nee has ever written. It teaches submission to all authority, according to the Bible, and not according to submission in today's society. All authority is from God (Romans 13:1), and so obedience to the authorities around us is obedience to the Lord. I think this is very important to us today. Brother Nee does a great job of taking us through many old and new testament examples of obedience and disobedience to authority. This book made me realize how disobedient I was to God by not being fully submissive to the authorities in my life."
4,Great Book,This book doesn't contain many pages but the pages it does have are very informative with lots of colored pictures for those of us who get bored of plain old black and white.
1,ludicrous,"This is an interesting movie but has no historical accuracy. The Mafia formed to protect Sicilian people. It came to the United States because Sicilian people were being harassed and assaulted and could not get jobs. It was to prevent Sicilian people from getting harmed and abused. That's why the Sicilian people supported the Mafia. Eventually, and unfortunately, it deteriorated into a criminal organization, which is of popular attraction because there are a lot of people who wish they had what appears to be absolute power over others. They get it vicariously by watching movies like The Godfather and The Sopranos, or, in a lighter vein, from following the antics of J.R. Ewing. In Sicily today the government is cracking down on the Mafia. This movie has adventure in it, and Eddie Albert is really handsome, but if you're looking for historical facts, look elsewhere."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"Forget this one, Bad acting, Bad screenplay. looks like a old 70's TV showno budget, I wonder what old dungeion they dug this up from. Boring gono where serius. cheap cheap cheap. All costumes look like they were holloween rentals at a bad mascerade party."
3,"good paddles, but","I'm a relatively strong swimmer, so ordered the red pair. This was the first time I used these TYR paddles (i've used others). In general they're good paddles, however the right one cracked and broke on the outer bottom edge. I was surprised given i've never had a paddle crack and break like that before (and I use paddles often in parts of my workout)."
2,looks like another model,"I thought these would be like the old school models but they are not. You have to use the wrist straps until the other older models. Not really anyone's fault.However, it asked me to rate the product... So I am."
1,they already broke!,"I was really impressed with a prior pair of paddles that lasted a long time (same brand, same size). This most recent set worked for four swim workouts before they broke. Very disappointing. I'm planning on contacting Amazon.com to see if they'll stand behind this product and replace it. Hopefully, I'll have the opportunity to give a 5-star review next time."
3,Correct Size = Experience Level. Not hand Size.,"I went to a specialty swim store and the lady tells me a large/blue paddle would be good becuase I have semi-large hands. Dam, one of my shoulders was killing me after doing a half mile. After reading the back of TYR packaging it clearly states or correlates color/size with your level of swimming experience. In hindsight, it now makes sense. A blue or large is for an elite collegiate swimmer. I forgot the others of the top of my head, but just because you have a large hand doesn't mean you need a large paddle. You think a specialty swim store would know this. She must have been new. Definitely won't be asking for any additional help from this store though."
4,Soft camera strap with some give and elasticity,"Nice, flexible strap. Detaches easily from camera body permitting easy storage. I use it with a Canon 5D with battery grip and have not concerns that it might break away from body.If any has the standard Canon or Nikon straps, I would encourage you to switch as this is so much more comfortable and does not cut into your neck or shoulder."
5,Great Book!,A must-have for any Fantasy or Vampire Novel-lover! I was intriqued by the creative storyline and it's modern edge. Read this book!
2,A Big Disappointment,"I bought this book after reading all of the wonderful reviews of it. I've been making handmade books and I have several other books on the subject and wanted to add another to my idea arsenal. What a disappointment this book is! I won't make a single project, and although I read the book cover-to-cover there is nothing I'll take with me. If you are interested in making paper art sculptures to display (and collect dust), then this book may be perfect for you! If you are interested in making BOOKS that are practical and useful and actually resemble BOOKS then look elsewhere."
3,A disappointment for an amateur,"I bought this book thinking that my granddaughter(7) and I could use it to guide us in making books, but the designs were elaborate and artsy. I sold it on e-bay shortly after I received it."
5,Make 'em last longer...,Tip to make them last longer....put a little anti-bacterial dish washing liquid in your hands and wash them with warm water. They become clean and bright yellow again and only take a little while to dry. Love the sound isolation and comfort of the foam! A must-have!
3,Do the Job but WAAAAY over priced.,"Disposable little tiny pieces of yellow foam which do a nice job of sealing your ears and providing comfort, however, they get dirty very quickly no matter how often you clean your ears before each use, and than you have to toss them and put in another pair.If you have a lot of disposable income,(pun intended) I suppose they may be worthwhile. However I've switched to the silicon as they are washable, last longer and with a little patience, get almost (though not exactly) as comfortable."
4,A must have for shure earphones,I have tried many times of sleeves for my Shure 3C. I even had custom sleeves specifically made for my ears. None worked as well as this one. It stays in the ear very well and provides excellent isolation. The only drawback is that you have to replace it fairly often.
3,Replacement Foams,"I purchased these for a Shure E5c almost 6 years ago. I finally had a custom pair of earpiece inserts made which, in the long run, is a better value and provides a much more consistent fit and sound quality from my earphones."
3,Shure Foams do the job,"I rate them a three for only one reason ... price. Ridiculous. They work great. They do the job. They last pretty OK. I like this style best of all the Shure options, so I really have no choice but to be robbed over and over again. There is no other alternative that I know of. I am NOT knocking Amazon or the reseller at all. It just is what it is."
3,Not universal,"I used to have shure e2c, which could use small/medium/large foam sleeves. The small fit perfectly for me. The higher-priced se series only takes the ""universal"" size. These are so oversized that the foam sometimes folds over on itself and dampens the sound. I'm still a fan of Shure, but these 1-size-fits-all sleeves are just plain idiotic.At the time I'm writing this you can get them cheaper directly from the Shure site."
3,Look for a better edition,"I'm not a Pilgrim's Progress expert, but this doesn't seem to be the best edition of this book. There are footnotes (including Bunyan's own notes) but they are often ""late""; for example, footnotes to explain the archaic meaning of the word are often included on the second or third appearance of the word. Also, the editor has included indicators as to who is speaking in each paragraph (much like a stage script) but it is not consistent.Shop around and see if you can find a better edition of Pilgrim's Progress."
4,adorable little dolls,I love these little dolls. They are very well made and have charactor. I don't normally buy toys but once in awhile I'll get a doll if the colors are bright and it's cheerful or fun. These are almost reminescent of the mid 1980's. Thats probably why I like these ones so much. Something about them reminds me of being a kid in the 80's.
1,Good god!,"Clearly a college with an interesting, albeit difficult, history (I am an alum), this Goucher history is written by Fred Musser, a former assistant to longtime President and propagandist Rhoda Dorsey. It is clearly a public relations work, with little interest in the opposing viewpoints of any matter and offering a sugar-coated view of one of America's most underachieving colleges."
4,Here comes family fun--Easter!!,"The kids and I snuggled the other night watching this movie. They loved the music and it definitely will be one of those they watch a bunch between now and Easter. (They'll even watch this one after Easter!) A refreshing, positive and family-oriented movie. Is the music available on CD anywhere?"
5,Awesome Update of a Classic!!!,"Great version of a classic Easter Bunny tale! Entertaining for kids as well as adults. REALLY! This movie is full of lively music, bright animation and relateable humor. It's so nice to have something for all ages to enjoy together. Highly recommended!!!"
2,7 months later and it doesn't work!,"I got this for Christmas and it worked pretty well. The CD player worked and the digital numbers were clear. The only thing I didn't like about it was the backlit screen at night. But a few months later the numbers started to fade and then in July I put a CD in and it read ""NO DISC"". I don't recommend buying it because it doen't last very long."
3,Wood finish????,I suppose for the price I shouldn't complain. But I did believe I was buying a wood product. It's not. But it is a good fake. Unfortunately it couldn't accomodate my vintage Mercedes otherwise I'd be using it. Not worth the trouble/or cost of returning.
4,Deserved more than what it got.,"If this cd was released in 1989, he would be right up there with Clint Black and Alan Jackson. But unfortunately this was released after all the fake country singers had came out and he got thrown in with them. This is a pure country album, complete with shuffles and plenty of steel guitar. After this cd, the quality of his music dropped, so grab this while you can and enjoy."
3,"Kids will like it, but I think it's rather lackluster","This book feels like it was created by someone who wanted to use ""cool"" features(the clear plastic sheets of ""snow"" that cover the characters, and the musical aspect at the end) and then wrote a story around it.If it weren't for the above, this book would get 1 star. The story line is weak & the ending is just awkward ""and then he pushed the button"". My 18 month old likes it, but only so I can push the button for her - which is hard to push for a little kid. But, I do not enjoy reading it to her."
5,Dream Snow,"What a delightful book! Not only does it help develop a child's counting skills, but the pictures are wonderful and the surprise ending is sure to bring a smile! I not only have a copy of this book for my own child, but have given copies as gifts."
5,Dream Snow,"A delightful tale to brighten the holidays. This is one of Carle's finest!!! Each time I read it the children in the class were tickled with the magic at the end!! I would recommend it to moms,, dads, grams and teachers!!!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE,"I love Eric Carle's books and so do my children. But save your money on this one. This is a clunker. The story is underwelming and the only saving grace is the ""tinkling"" tree at the end. Not worth the price in my opinion."
2,A let-down,"The illustrations enticed me to buy this book without reading it. As my family sat around the Christmas tree, warmed by the fire, we began reading the book only to be completely disappointed at the ending. ""What,"" cried the family, ""was that all about?"" With a great beginning, rather unique and interresting and wonderful illustrations, the story went nowhere and will be returned to the bookstore as soon as I get a chance."
3,A bit overrated,"I eagerly awaited delivery of this book after reading and loving many other of Eric Carle's books. I was disappointed with this one. It relies on two gimmicks, not on the quality of the story, in my view. And I don't think the quality of the artwork is up to Carle's usual very high standards. I will be returning this book."
4,A genuine holiday classic,"In a world filled with commercial holiday books based on popular kids' movies or cartoon characters, it's nice to have a simple story about kindness, hope and the magic of the season. I bought this book for my older son when he was 4. Now both my sons, 6 and 2 love to read it year-round."
5,We love Eric Carle books.,My younger students loved this book and took turns pressing the button to hear the magic jingle sound. Very enjoyable.
5,Great!,My daughter asked for this book for Christmas. She was so happy to open it and enjoys it every time she reads it!
5,Why so expensive?,"When you see it it is self evident that this is not some mass printed card.There is a reality we live with. Right now digital cameras can take in far greater color information than our monitors can show us. This is like ""play"" in a steering mechanism. You don't know exactly what that setting means. Somewhere between viewing and printing ($$$) you need to get a grip on actuality.Simply getting red right might badly maul everything else. But having a color card attuned to 24 natural colors (those are not just random colors) gives an opportunity to tune your system to reality.In a slightly untuned system the card will show WRONG colors. So shoot the card in any serious work. Cheap insurance."
5,Video Board Book,"This is very much like a Board Book for babies. It has what most babies at about 6 months are interested in: other babies, music and red (Elmo). The video is great for new parents who aren't quite sure what to do with their baby.If you can get them to watch it, this would also be a good tool for new fathers who want to be involved but aren't sure what to do. Much of what is in this video is very similiar to recent Baby and Father classes (minus the basic care of babies part).This video is primarily a springboard for interacting with babies and toddlers rather than a babysitter. Some people may use it that way anyway, but it is most effective when a parent is watching it with the baby interactively."
1,I love it!,"A great way to acclimate your kids to the wonders of sweet, hypnotic television graphics. Odds are they'll be a couch potato anyway, you may as well start them early.Don't listen to those fancy-pants pediatricians!"
5,AMAZING,We have checked out both Sesame Beginnings from the library and are now buying them. My daughter is almost two and she LOVES them. She learns a lot of mastery from watching the babies. She was all consumed with Elmos World but now asks for these videos. The music is really wonderful and she sings and dances along.
4,Baby Likes it!,"I bought this dvd because it was also in spanish and my baby only watches it in spanish. She is 6 months old and likes watching the fluffy figures, she smiles and dances with them. I don't give it 5 stars because although they use good spanish the names of the characters remain in english eventhough they have their own name in spanish."
2,Not for me,My son didn't care too much for it & the high pitched squeaky voices were too much for me to handle.
2,Stick to Baby Einstein,My 9 month old is not interested in this at all... she loves her Baby Einsteins. I got her this thinking she'll enjoy something different but that was not the case.
2,Disappointing,"I was excited to bring this video home to my 15 month old twins, but was quite dissapointed with it. I had expected more of the collaboration between Sesame Street and Zero to Three. Where is the fun and cleverness of Sesame Street? Where is the variety and the creative graphic quality? This video was quite boring and preachy. Particularly Prairie Dawn's mother's comment about music helping with language development. Please, why add that? I was looking forward to a little wackiness from Wayne Brady, but he was dull and repressed as well. Too bad. This could have been really fun, entertaining for little ones and developmentally appropriate. I think they missed their chance with this one. Oh, and it's too short."
2,Not that great,"I figured my daughter loves Sesame street that she would love this video. It's boring, and there is too much talking and not enough of the actual characters."
