1,Celebrities with MS,"I have a hard time encouraging celebrities with MS to write books about their experiences, especially when they've lived with the disease for less than two years.The everyday person with MS does not lead a priveledged life. They have financial difficulties, time constraints, and worries that extend beyond the life of a celebrity.It often takes many years to learn to live with this disease. I wonder what Montel will have to say ten or twenty years from now."
1,Dollhouse Kitchen Accessories,"Very disappointed in the # of kitchen accessories for the price!!!!I returned them & my account was refunded, minus the shipping.Melissa & Doug Deluxe Doll-House Kitchen Accessories"
5,Great fun!,"These are great for imaginative house play. Some of these pieces, like the tea cups, are super small just so you know. Easy to lose pieces but fun while you have them!"
2,CD,Bought this CD because of a selection I heard on the radio. While the selection I bought it for is good the rest of the selections leave a lot to be desired. I think the group should have made a better group of selections before recording this CD.
1,bland......,"i have been a flamenco fan for years...if truly a fan, this is not one to purchase.......instead, look to real flamenco players like paco delucia....or other mainstream spanish players......one has to listen to the technical ability of this guitarist to find not much to enjoy......theres better out there for sure.."
2,"Good idea, but too much violence detracts from satire","This movie started with an intelligent, nervy idea, and is extremely well-cast. Trouble is, there's not enough cutting satire, and what there is gets overshadowed by some rather ugly scenes of ruthless violence. It doesn't matter how cute Matt Damon is, it's just not funny when he takes out a large handgun and blows innocent people's heads off. Ditto Ben Affleck, who's the lesser actor, and whose own adventure into bloodletting at the end ruined the film.Salma Hayek and Alan Rickman totally outclassed everyone else in the production. The Jay character was not as funny as we wanted him to be (note to Kevin Smith: you can be lewd, and you can be crude, but it ain't funny if it ain't delivered right).In short, not enough potshots at the church, and too many gunshots at the walk-ons."
5,wow,A great book to read. It is written in an easy to read style and the subject matter is a blessing. Well worth the time taken to read it.
3,Howard still rules the airwaves!,"This is an e.p. that focuses on the King Of All Media. All contant aside, Howard is still, and will remain until his last performance, the 100% absolute TRUE KING OF ALL MEDIA and the master of the airwaves. Pick this up if you are looking for an addition to ""Unclean Beaver"" and the ""Private Parts"" soundtrack!"
5,Help for unruly kids,I bought this for my daughter who has two roudy boys. I pray it works (for her sake).
3,Good read for parents of toddlers!,This doesn't say anything that I don't already know but this does put things into perspective from a psychological point of view. Good read so far!
5,It Works!,"Not only is Dr. Leman a delightful writer, his principles with kids really works to control and teach them without getting too badly upset with them, fly off into abuse or tear your hair out. Wish I had had this book when our daughter was younger--it would have saved me a lot of frustration by just letting the natural consequences of what she did wrong teach her. So I bought the book for her now as she comes to the time to have her own kids."
5,Raising Children Against the World View,"I found ""Making Children Mind"" a practical, Christian philosophy of raising kids. As a Christian, I know all truths have biblical roots. I have read other materials Christian and non that support Leman's views.His major point that kids have to learn to live in a real world where decisions have real consequences is spot on. At times he oversimplifies points; but, in general it is a good book to have in your library."
4,Too religious for me,"Although this book is well written and has excellent advice, I was put off by all the scripture quoting and references to ""Our Heavenly Father"". Also, I could not get past the fact that he condones spanking.I think this would be a great book for someone who had never read any parenting books and was very religious. After reading many parenting books, I found nothing new in this one, and would much rather reccomend ""Kids are worth it"" or ""How to talk to your Kids..."", ""Positive Discipline"" or Sears' ""The discipline book"""
3,Preachy and Too Simplistic,"The overall strategies in this book have some clout, but the overwhelming religious preaching is a nuisance at best. Leman assumes everyone is religious and everyone who is religious is Christian. Constantly quoting the New Testament as if it were a Christian Bible class is a huge turn off in this book. Not to mention his blanket approval of spanking as long as you say you love them afterwards....I like many of his approaches but his way is only one way and I found he speaks as the ultimate authority leaving very little room for the many children that are not ""cured"" by his theories.I found he speaks much more about God than he did about sibling rivalry a huge issue in many homes, and probably expects you to buy his book specifically about that."
3,It didn't arrive in condition ordered.,"I ordered a new book. When I received the book it had been cut with a box cutter up the right edge of the cover and several pages after. The was also a watermark across the bottom of the book. I was disappointed that the company sent me a ""new"" book that they was damaged. While they did offer to allow me to return the book at no charge and receive a full refund or they would return 50% of the price I paid if I chose to keep the book, I felt the company was dishonest when they sold the book as new instead of damaged. I would not buy from them again."
1,This is a bad book.,Making Children Mind without Losing YoursI am writing this review only because I am already part of the statistics after buying this book through Amazon.I want to make sure that people know that I do not like this book.
4,Book - Making Children Mind without Losing Yours,"I'm still reading this book. So far this book has given some good tools to use to help be consistent with the kids. However, it seems easier reading it in the book than actually doing it."
5,Very insightful,"This has helped in many ways in our household, very glad I purchased it! Couldnt be happier with this purchase!"
5,Invaluable,"This book is invaluable for parents that want to have obedient and truly happy children, in my opinion the only two goals that really matter in the raising of children. Highly recommended."
4,so far so good,"Other than the religious undertones, most of the advice seems logical. Of course every child is different. Overall, I found it to be helpful and have seen a change in my children's behavior"
5,Best ever,"I've read a LOT of parenting books. This is the best one I've read by far. His methods teach a balance of respect and discipline that make so much sense! And it works! I have been trying to move away from so many punitive measures in disciplining my kids, but I could never buy into the completely positive discipline style of discipline. This book (and video series) was a true answer to prayer for me and my husband. It teaches a balance of punishment and discipline with self control and respect. We have been trying to apply this philosophy in our family, and this book gives great practical examples. I have seen a real difference in my kids and have felt it in myself."
4,funny little Bigfoot-story,"This is a funny Bigfoot-adventure with sarcastic remarks in abundance. You got the Native American mystic, and, like in Esau by P.Kerr and Neanderthal by J.Darnton the good-looking female scientist. But in the end the mystery about Bigfoot is not entirely solved, so there is place for it in the reader's imagination."
4,Emotional Book,"This book was very good. The first story was great, up until I found out why Jonathan kept her away from him for five years. I didn't really think that his reason was a bad enough one for all the drama and hate. It jumps from their past together to the present a lot also. It has a lot of heated emotional scenes. The second story was a little better than the first. The ending was very good. It takes place in the city and then on a ranch. Egan thinks he knows and understands Katie, but he really doesn't know or understand her at all. You don't really get to see them as a loving couple that much though. It was too short."
2,The Australian,"Diana Palmer has obviously extensively researched her story 'The Australian'. However, this Australian sees many glaring errors in this story! For example, Randy is a distinctly American name. I have never met an Aussie called Randy! Palmer overuses many Australianisms such as 'Crikey', and often uses them in the wrong context. Many times this story made me cringe! 'The Australian' was obviously written for an American market."
5,what a nice purchase!,"it's cheap and fast. i would like to recommend others visit this seller and buy his products, when the book costs much more at the bookstore."
2,A New Low For Seduction Cinema,"Gone are the days of the great ""eroctic parodies"" Seduction Cinema was once known for, apparently. Don't let the title of this disc fool you into thinking they have spoofed Buffy in their classic style. Unfortunately, what is being sold as MUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is actually a 1999 film called CARESS OF THE VAMPIRE 3. The only difference is the dialogue has been re-looped for clarity. This is the exact same movie re-packaged (along with a new short film called VAMPIRE QUEEN which is quite good)."
3,Female Vampires From Outer Space!!!,"This is a very strange movie. The plot centers around a very sexy female vampire who has come to earth from outer space. The twist is that she only likes other women. Needless to say, there's a lot of sex and nudity in this movie, so its definitely not for younger audiences. The plot is hard to follow, but if you bought this video for the plot, then something's wrong. Watch this movie late at night when the kids are asleep."
4,"Explore Tucumcari, Tonite !","If you've ever driven from Amarillo to Albuquerque, you've surely driven through Tucumcari. And you've probably wondered, why the heck is this town even here? Well wonder no more. This book has all the answers. Turns out there's more to this dusty little Route 66 town than their famous billboards, and their stretch of classic motels. People have used Tucumcari Mountain as a navigation landmark for at least five centuries, and this short book gives a brief glimpse of all of them. Great detail is given to the railroads, and the many towns that sprung up to service them, and then faded away when the mines played out, and other forms of transportation replaced them. Even though I've spent a grand total of 20 minutes in Tucumcari, I now feel I know its history better than that of my own hometown."
3,Replacement robe,I initially purchased this robe as a replacement to another Jesus robe that was accidentally torn. While it fits comfortably it tends to restrict leg movement at the bottom more than comparable costume-robes. Good material.
5,EXCELLENT,"THE CHAIRS ARE GREAT, THEY CAME IN SOONER THAN EXPECTED AND WERE REASONABLE AND CONSTRUCTED WELL."
3,Nice collection of rare footage,"Both dvd's tend to reuse the same footage as the other - one tells the story of Elvis using various clips and narration while the other is purely a collection of rare footage - some very interesting stuff such as a 1970 and 1972 Press conference's as well as a 73' interview for the Aloha special. The 1970 one I have never seen and am surprised it is not utilized more often.Although the quality is not perfect, the footage is basically very good .Keep in mind no musical performances are included as the makers would have to pay for the use of songs . Still a interesting collection of rare footage from the 1950's (nice sketch with Milton Berle @ Andy Griffith !) thru to the 70's."
4,A little bit of everything,"I absolutely loved The Beauty Of June. From page one I was hooked! June transforms with each page, and the writer leaves you guessing until the very last minute with the information of what really happened to June in her life. A phenomenal story indeed!"
2,"Functional, but not as promised","The product we received was 10x13, unlike the product described in the first review. However, these are definitely not ready seal envelopes. Not only do these not have the peel strip, the supposed ""fold and seal"" sticky material does not stick whatsoever. It is definitely moisture activated, unlike what is stated in the product description. So, while we will be able to use this product, we will also have to use envelope sealant in order to use it. We are disappointed in what we received."
1,Total MORONS,Ordered this and they sent 10x13 envelopes and so I replaced with same item and once again they sent the wrong size. Called customer service and got someone who couldn't speak English. 15 minutes later they said to return them and we had to go through the trouble of dropping them off somewhere.Classic BS
4,New Sound for Best Monster Building Flick,"For several years classic movie soundtrack aficionados were content withthe original soundtrack recording made from the 1935 film ""Bride of Frankenstein""with composer Franz Waxman conducting the studio orchestra. Since most critics feelthat this was director James Whale's best monster film, they welcomed this cleaned upcontemporary version by Kenneth Alwyn and the Westminster Philharmonic Orchestra.It will motivate new people to watch the film on TCM or other TV outlets and they willrealize that ""Bride"" had a much larger influence on ""Young Frankenstein"" than theoriginal film --- among other delights."
4,Great Rerecording Of A Classic Score,"I have been looking for an original version of this 1935 classic, and one of the greatest films ever made, but I have yet to find it. I was in NY a few days ago, and picked up this version in the Virgin Records Mega Store. I decided, ""what the hel, can't be that bad."" And, as I suspected, it wasn't.The reason that I only gave this rerecording 4 stars, is that Ieven though it is a great updated version of the score, it just lacked something. Something that the original Waxman score has. Its still a great buy, and with Halloween approaching, it is a must have for any horror film buff, like myself. Until the original film score is rereleased, this will be more than adadquate to hold me over. Finally, I have something to play in the background when I enter the world of ""gods and monsters."""
1,A Little Disappointed,"I was hoping for more of the ""Flash Gordon"" type music from the old B&W serials with Buster Crabbe. I played this cd once & now it is collecting dust somewhere."
3,"Confusing but Interesting Historical Perspective, Sort of...","This book is not a great telling of the story of E. Bathory. However, the intertwining of family marriages and who is related to who is dizzying and intriguing. This leads one to assume that E was very much a victim of inbreeding, not to mention she was simply nuts.Not the best book on the subject but quotes the trial at the time. There are key facts that are excluded from the book but not at anyone's fault, the powers that be at the time struck them from the official records and were destroyed. Supposedly because they were so gruesome. That sounds like interesting reading!Get the book if you are curious of an almost too detailed description of the story. However, keep in mind that it's not the details that one really wants to read. Also, the book jumps from E to others who have had similar behaviors.It's a bit boring but at the time I purchased it there weren't many books out there about the actual trial."
2,"Like Her Victims, A Terrible Mess","This has got to be the most poorly written book I've ever read. Unnecessarily flowerly prose makes much of the work incomprehensible, and what is understandable is loaded with minute detail about things that add absolutely nothing to the story or our understanding of it's subject. A totally unrelated chapter devoted to the crimes of Giles de Raiis only adds to the confusion. Try instead, the fictional ""Blood Countess."" It's far more readable and there's probably enough fact in the mix to give readers the overview they won't find here."
1,"Well, it was pretty bad.","I haven't read something this poorly written since Christian Jacq's 'Ramses - Son of Light'. I attributed the thin, 2-dimensional prose to an inept translation from French to English. Could this be the same reason? It is quite bad."
2,Mindless Tripe,"Not to be taken as a serious, scholarly work on its own. It reads more like a bad novel occasionally hemorrhaging facts--perversely analogous to one of Bathory's poor victims. Sadly, there is no clear dividing line between facts and breezy, flatulant fiction-writing. Unless you are experienced in reading poorly written continental-European prose, are some sort of PoMo cretin, or are some teenaged Goth/dork, the value to be culled from reading this book is little worth the effort."
4,My Dark Princess,I loved this book. I only gave it 4 outta 5 due to very detailed Hungarian history. It was hard to keep all the names of all the towns and castles in order. The story itself was great and full of delicious gore and I have recommended this book to many friends.
2,Sad...,We were so disappointed with this movie. We tried to hang in there until it found a direction... But there was no direction... There was no point... It was just sad.
1,hmmm.....,"I thought this book was Boring. I could tell he hasnt had any schooling for writing. I couldnt get myself to enjoy this book, sorry."
2,This sucks,Make the nightmare that is iron maiden go away. Get your asses off the stage. There is a time to quit.
4,"A little Too Raw, But Worth Your Money","The concert is excellent, the sound is superb. The extras are a little frustating.Maiden deserves a better production than this DVD ended up having, but still is one of the best Live DVDs around.thumbs up!"
5,Fantastic,a perfect show... hours of Maiden's best performance to date I can easily say... a must have.. Maiden rules
3,May cause seizures...,"I really enjoyed the set list on this DVD concert. I had no problem with some of concert being devoted to 'Brave New World' as it is one of my favorite Maiden albums. But, along with everyone else, it would have been nice if the cameras could have lingered for longer than 3 seconds at a time on one musician or vocalist, as the case may be. The camera work gave me a headache!!! Also, Janick Gers is such a tiresome twit!!! I was happy with the lack of audience members mugging for the camera, however. (Thank you, IM!!) The Day in the Life of the band on the second disc wasn't anything to write home about, I could have skipped it entirely. (I had to wonder why they even bothered with the Easter Egg portions.)I would rent this again, but I wouldn't buy it. I will buy the CD or download the album instead."
4,"great concert,bad editing","This is a good dvd of a great concert. The set list is fantastic. A good representation of old and new Maiden. Bruce Dickinson has more energy than any other frontman I've seen.The sound quality was very good on my system, however, the video editing [stunk] bigtime! I can't believe a guitar player edited the video for this dvd. The camera was never on the lead guitarist during leads. They must have used 1000 cameras to film this video because they changed to a different camera every second for the whole concert. It was annoying. I've been a big Maiden fan since the first album and have seen them live many times. I wish the video was as good as the music."
2,Mixing Issues,"This would be a great DVD, but the mixing left the vocals clouded. The crowd noise and the instruments leave the vocals barely audible. If this was done intentially, then maybe they shouldnt have put this product out. I love Maiden, but this DVD is getting returned for a full refund."
2,Great concert; terrible editing,"I bought Rock in Rio because I like Iron Maiden and I really enjoy good concert DVDs. The concert is strong, the audio excellent, the video quality is outstanding. So why only 2 stars? The editing is horrific!!! The footage is cutting to another shot every second. At some times, it's cutting 3-4 times PER SECOND. I found the DVD to be unwatchable, which really made me angry since it was a good concert with good audio and video quality that was ruined. It turns out that Steve Harris edited this DVD - Steve, stick to what you do well. If you are a hard, hard core Iron Maiden fan, go ahead and buy the DVD - you will probably enjoy it. However, if you hate videos where they are always doing the fast cut to another shot, skip this one."
5,De lo mejorcito,"Nunca habia visto un concierto de Iron Maiden, y este dvd me ha dado una idea sorprendente de lo que son en directo. Una gran calidad, un buen montaje, y sobre todo un sonido que es como si lo estuvieras viviendo en el mismisimo Rio."
3,"""Speak up bruce""",This is an outstanding DVD. I will watch it repeatedley im sure. but the vocals that i think really should be comming through the center do not all you get is a guitar that sounds like you are listening to a direct feed of his amp. you can barely even hear bruce even in DTS mode
2,"Sounds great, but too much flipping around with the camera","Well I waited for this for so long now, finally got it. Disapointed. It gave me a headache to watch, its much better if you don't watch it and just listen to it.For whatever reason they keep flipping the camera around never showing the same angle for more than 1 second. Or every 2 beats or so they show a different angle. It would have been great if they did multiple angles instead."
3,Band and music is awesome...DVD production SUX!,"If you saw this band and video for the first time, you would think it was several different solo acts. The video editing is downright frustrating to watch. You hardly ever see a full band shot for more than 2 seconds. And...why video instead of film? Bad decision. Watch both Alice Cooper videos..TRASHES THE WORLD and BRUTALLY LIVE if you want a lesson in live video."
2,The worst edition I have ever seen!!,"The worst thing that could happen for Iron Maiden was when its founder, its boss, the marvellous bass player and songwriter called Steve Harris decided to edit this DVD. I don't understand it.Theoretically trying to ""capture"" the famous Maiden energy and vibe on stage, he opted for using a ultra-fast edition that will make your head spin, without paying any attention for who is soloing at the moment, if Nicko is at the middle of a great drums flourish, etc. All of the takes last, in their majority, less than one second and a half. The result was that you simply have no pleasure watching this MTV-styled DVD, thanks to its terrible edition.Well, that's my opinion. Of course, the ""UP THE IRONS"" guys will love anything this deservedly great band release."
4,Up the Irons,Great show with a great setlist. Any DVD sells Maiden short from seeing them live. UP THE IRONS! NIKO MCBRAIN RULES!
3,"Content Good, Packaging Not So Much","I'm a huge Maiden fan and I have been trying to fill out my collection of CDs and DVDs for a while. I did not have, nor had I seen, the Rock In Rio DVD. I was very excited when it arrived and I couldn't wait to watch it. When I opened the flimsy packaging the first thing I noticed was that the DVDs were sliding around freely. The tiny foam pads that were supposed to be holding them in place had ripped loose from the package at some point during shipping. Consequently the DVDs were pretty scratched up. It took two passes with a repair kit to get the discs to play without freezing up in the DVD player.The concert itself was amazing. Rock In Rio was the last stop on Maiden's Brave New World tour and they didn't hold back one bit! The extras were also very good, showing what the guys do on a day off."
4,Beast of a concert video,"I've been an IM fan since 1981, seen them twice. While the Ironsare older, the energy is still there. Playing for nearly aquarter million enthusiastic fans, The band seems to feed offthe crowd's energy. (For a two-hour set, they needed it)The setdid contain some long selections- ""Sign of the cross"", ""Ghost ofthe navigator"", etc., but they are played so well that this isreally not an issue. The editing can be a bit annoying, jumpingfrom each bandmember every 10 seconds or so. This was probablyIM's finest hour, glad it was caught on video. A great comeback!"
2,BLinding fast edition makes this DVD unwatchable!,"The sound is great and the image also is. But watching this DVD back-to-back may be a real pain in the a...You simply are not allowed to focus your eyes more than one second in each scene. It seems it was made on purpose, maybe to compete with the horrible Chritina Aguillera videos...I sold my copy of this one, even loving Iron Maiden. This DVD is unwatchable."
3,Its No Live After Death...,"...This concert sounds okay but the camera shots are too jumpy. I found myself comparing it to the After Death concert too much. I could not enjoy their new style. Every band changes over the years and I guess I cannot accept the new Maiden.I keep hoping they will release After Death on DVD but until then I will settle for this one...If you are a hardcore Maiden fan, buy it but do not expect the same concert you saw 17 years ago."
2,Had potencial but It's not good enough,The concert had potencial to be one of the best Maiden concertaround but it was poorly edited. The main problem is the soundlevel that fluctuates all the time and the fact that theydon't have a 2-channel stereo soundtrack. The image quality isgood but it is poorly edited. We don't have a chance to seea single second of any of the band members. The imagekeeps changing from one to another every second.I'm disappointed.
5,Somewhere in the Cover or Eyewitness : I was there too,"This DVD is already available here and it's for me a very special opportunity to see again the show I saw on Jan, 19th,2001.To you I'd just say that this DVD successfully shows the climate of being in an Iron Maiden show.To the Iron Maiden team I'd like to say THANKS for this chance to remember that night, just like Bruce said, that was a very special night."
3,First of all I am an Iron Maiden fan...,"I have seen Maiden 3 times and I think that they are one of the best bands ever. Rock in Rio is a decent DVD, but it is missing something that I can not put my finger on. I think that the selection of songs is what is lacking from this DVD. Its cool that they played quite a number off their most recent release, but the older tracks could and should have been choosen differently. The older tracks are good, but I would have choose different ones, ones that have not been played to death on their previous live recordings. That is why I gave it three stars. Production is very good, camera moves to much around though. It is worth adding to a collection."
5,Mastered the Art,"Iron Maiden has mastered the art of providing both a musical and visual kick in the face. There is no band in my opinion that has been able to capture their essence in the dvd format better than Iron Maiden. The sound on this dvd is incredible. The three guitars mesh incredibly well in the studio and live. They play with such precision it's remarkable. The camera work is great but I do wish they didn't cut from camera to camera as frequently as they do. That of course, is certainly not limited to this dvd as I find it to be the case with most concert dvds. As with any band with an extensive catalog, there are some songs I would substitute but this isn't a chinese food place. This concert is from that tour and thus, we get that set list. This dvd is a must have for all metal fans. Those wishing to check out what Iron Maiden is all about or those who have been upping the irons for decades will be thoroughly pleased. I can't recommend this enough."
4,Many good tips offered,"I love languages and I am currently studying both French and Spanish. I bought this book hoping that it would help me improve my language skills and motivate me to study other languages. I was not disappointed. Farber kept me interested and did offer many worthwhile tips to help me. His ""Multiple track"" system is wonderful.The only problem I had was that the book seems outdated being written in the early 1990's. There was no mention of the Internet and any on the new language tools on the market. I wish Mr Farber would write a 2nd edition of this book. I still highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in languages."
4,Great Tips for finding time to study!!,"This book offers great tips and pointers on how to fit the studying of a foreign language into our busy day! It also offers information about various languages - pros and cons of undertaking the study of a particular language. His tips allow you to squeeze in ""mini lessons"" throughout the day- and his point of not taking a day off while studying a language is key. This would be a helpful book to decide which language to study or to spur you on if you are feeling ""overwhelmed"" while studying one."
5,Superb!,"This book changed my life. Using Farber's techniques I have already mastered 10 foreign languages, and look forward to learning more."
1,This book will give you false information,"This book starts from the author's boast of how many languages he can ""speak"" and how talented he is. Then it starts giving you a tiny bit of information about each language that is almost useless. For example, he says, in Japanese section, ""Like Chinese, Japanese conversation is fairly easy."" which makes me laugh. It is absolutely not true, and I know that because I am a native Japanese speaker who has been teaching Japanese to Americans. Apparently he knows no Japanese and he mixed things up with his little knowledge about Chinese. Even though we share similar characters, speaking Chinese and Japanese are totally different.These information about each languages can be easily found if you just go to a bookstore and browse some dictionaries of foreign languages.If you really want to learn languages, don't buy this book unless you want to read about his useless boasts."
3,Learn Any Language,"Good book, but is abit dated since it was published in 1991. The author should revise it, to bring it up to date."
4,"Needs more in the pot, such as Rosetta Stone programs","found book inspirational, but to help make learning a foreign language painless, additional techniques to avoid body stress while learning should be incorporated. Learning flat on your bed would help. The Levo Bookholder from backbenimble.com allows hands free reading. The Laptop Laidback with the Rosetta Stone Levels 1 and 2 installed in your laptop makes a very useful 'Multiple-Track Attack' addition while learning near horizontal on your back using the Finger Track Mouse from Fentek Industries.The Complete Guide to Memory Mastery by Harry Lorayne also recommended to supplement."
5,Farber speaks 32 languages and shows you how he did it!,"The essence of this text is a speed-learning system for learninglanguages. Farber's genius involves taking language learning downfrom 1 hour lessons to using spare time in the day as short as aminute or even twenty seconds to acquire a new word or phrase.Waiting for a friend to answer the telephone? FLIP a blue flashcardand learn the French word for pen ""le stylo"". Waiting for a computerto boot up? Well, flip a pink flashcard of your own and learn thefeminine French word for mouth ""la bouche"". CLEVER MICRO LEARNING!And the book has even more techniques, stories, and anecdotes froma man who speaks over 32 languages!!!HOW TO LEARN ANY LANGUAGE is an essential work for any person whoneeds to learn languages. After Farber everyone else who teacheslanguages is a mere amateur. This book is like the fire from thegods that Prometheus brought to earth.---- C.K. Dexter Haven."
5,Outstanding - Bound to inspire all!,"I had so much fun learning German for the last 30 years. Barry Farber opened my eyes to the other languages. I have since taken a French course at OSU and have enlarged my foreign language library to include Chinese, Russian, Spanish, French, Dutch, and Czech. I find out about the wonderful Pimsleur courses from Mr. Farber. And I found out that the sky is the limit. I love the story about his first Russian class. And about the intensive week-end outting. Thank you Mr. Farber."
4,Excellent for step-by-step details and personal examples.,"The author's very entertaining stories of trying to learn languages as a teen help give him the authority to tell others how to go about it. He admits frankly that he did not use all the tips he now offers the reader--but he wishes he had! The book is useful in describing just how to use many different aids (tapes, flashcards, etc.) to accomplish rapid learning. He also gives advice on proper social behavior, use of obscene language, etc. He knows well over a dozen languages but does not claim to be fluent in all of them."
2,Fine for a couple of years then started to leak,"The heater worked very well for between two and three years, but when I turned it on this winter, it started to leak oil. Once that happens, the unit has to be discarded. My much older DeLonghi oil heaters are still working with no leaks. I gave two stars because even though the heater was efficient, I think it should have lasted longer."
2,good for a year +,"This heater worked really well for me until last night. Now the dial that turns on the heating mechanism is broken. I purchased this in April, 2008 and the warranty has been expired for a long time. I expect things like this to last a long time, since I do not like adding junk to landfills or paying another $55 for a heater. Hopefully someone from freecycle will want it and know how to fix it. Next time I will buy a Delonghi because I have had one of those for years and it still works fine."
1,It is supposed to be odorless as labelled on the box,"When I first used the heater, there was an odor in the air that give me an headache. I don't know what chemical they used to induce such an odor, but it nauseated me. I experienced this using DeLonghi SafeHeat heater. Both were made in China."
1,bad product,"Well, had I been able to get the wheels to stay on and turn on the heater, I might have a better review, but alas."
4,I like the heater,"It takes a few hours on the high setting, but it can warm up my small basement real good. Then I turn it to medium or low during the night, so I can get out of bed real comfortable in the morning. Dandy thing."
5,"Ah, Irish Magic!","What a lovely book! I gave it as a gift to myself, because Father Greeley is one of my guilty pleasures. I have always been a huge fan of the work of Charles De Lint, and the Butter Spirit's tithe was a great read, very fun. Likewise Elizabeth Haydon, whose prose has always reminded me a little bit of William Butler Yeats, infuses her charming take with the poetry only found in Irish blood. Judith Tarr, an author I had not read before, also impressed me favorably.There is not a truly bad story in here, though I thought the Carey and Yolen tales could have been a bit better told. But all in all, this is a wonderful collection for anyone who enjoys great storytelling, a great variety of interpretation, and magic."
4,Worth the time,"I read this book recently and enjoyed it. There are some excellent writers and some good stories. Thank god only two of them are about vampires (apparently an old Irish myth). If you are a SF/Fantasy reader, I think this book is well worth your time."
1,AZ Perfume Massively Overcharges for this Product,"While this product is great, AZ Perfume charges $30 for an 8.5 ounce bottle of Aveda shampoo, or almost double the $16.95 what you would pay from other vendors or the salons. Save yourself some money and buy from a more reputable vendor than these vultures. Shame on Amazon, by the way, for tolerating blatant price gouging on its website."
1,never received,I never received this product. I was sent a sun care treatment instead. When I contacted the seller about the problem I never received a response.
4,Maturity works for her,"The young JoJo is most definitely growing up, and this album shows it. It's highly seductive, yet sweet and light. This album is leaps and bounds better than her debut album, with harmonies that really support the feel of the whole album. Though there is still the strong sense of enhancement (lots of electronic adjustments, i.e. echoes), they still work here.Definitely worth a listen."
3,The High Road - JoJo,Disappointing CD. Not a great offering of selections. JoJo's talent is not presented in this CD.
1,tired Album,"JoJo has some talent,but whoever is handling her career isn't going about things in the right way. these songs sound like a dime a dozen. a bit Christina here a bit Beyonce there, basically lets play name that tune&Vocal run. JoJo wants to be mentioned as a Artist with R&B roots,but thus far her music comes across like generic attempts at trying to hybrid R&B. if JoJo ever aspires to be the Teena Marie of her Generation than she will need the right Producer&also get some real songwriting as to the fast food vibe that is felt on alot of these tracks."
5,A CD I Never Wanted In the First Place- but fell in love with,"I remember when I recieved this. Christmas- 2006- I was 10. The only song I'd heard by Jojo by then was ""Leave (Get Out)"" and by then I'd forgotten that she was even the singer. So when I found this CD, wrapped up in my stocking, I was confused. My mom then went on to explain that it was a clearance CD. Anyway, I listened to it. I fell in love with the CD. Jojo, an R&B / Soul diva, shines on this album. Her vocals are spentacular. Recently, I started listening to her again after the release of her mixtape. Love this girl."
2,Not as great as expected,"There are about 3 farily good songs on this CD. With the anticipation of her vocals and loops on her number one hit for this CD, she didn't meet expecations on her other songs. I don't like the loops on most of the tracks they are not energizing or inspirational. She is a pretty good vocalist so maybe as she gets older her voice will be more powerful than it is now."
4,I like it,I think that Jo Jo is a very talented young woman. I love the strength in her voice. I admire her album as well. It is very clean and sincere. I hope she doesn't turn away from her innocence and become a diva like Christina Aguilara (who also has a beautiful voice). We already have enough female artists that started out doing really well and then turned around and started using sex to sell their albums.
2,Awful movie...sexy girl,"Well, what can I say. This movie pretty much stinks. Suffice it to say that the main characters become mass murderers during the course of this thing, murderers of a whole lot of innocent people. But as is so typical of these ""check your IQ at the door"" type of films, the dead were all members of the military, so apparently the writers didn't see any reason why anyone should care. Oh, your average audience member who's smart enough to tie their own shoes might notice, but the makers of the film didn't. That's just a bit too deep and intellectual for them.However, if you like looking at a pretty girl in a black bra and a skin-tight T-shirt getting squirted with water, diving into water, and generally running around while very wet, well, this movie does deliver that. She even takes her T-shirt off at the end, but it's too dark to really see anything. I suppose you could try turning up the brightness on your set.And that's about it."
2,See! You can still make a movie for $9.95!,"Here goes. 90% CGI, lame story line, tired screenplay, cheap sets, ""C"" List actors, plastic boobs (total b*tch!). OK...so what do you want for straight-to-video!?"
1,Waterproof? Ha!,"The second time we attempted to use the Extech ""waterproof"" DO Meter we found it totally dead. When we removed the cap, the entire inside of the meter was wet with water an battery acids. Either outside water had entered the meter from somewhere or the fluid around the probe found its way inside the meter. Either way this was not only a useless purchase but it's failure has possible compromised a study. Extech will not be on anybody's shopping list around here any time soon!"
1,Good Concept but Bad Execution,"I bought this software since I have ScrapbookFactory Deluxe v 2.0. The new functionality looks great, too good to be true.From my previous experience with this software I should have known they would not improve on their software from crashing. But the concept is there but the execution of the software is not.This current version I can not even get it loaded on my computer without getting computer errors or even get it to load properly. Nova claims they support this product 100% but that can not be true since I still can not get it to work. The customer service thought the problem was in a defective 3rd disc and sent me a new one. It still does not work and I still do not have it installed on my computer.There are other scrapbooking software they may not be able to do everything that this one does but at least you will have reliable software."
5,Exactly what I was looking for...,I purchased this product for myself for mother's day. It is wonderful. Easy to use. Exactly what I was looking for.
2,OK If you have time to kill,"This program is ok, just ok, and even then, only if you have time to kill. After terribly long waits to do almost anything, you will have the nicest scrapbook pages that a three year old could produce. Amateurish to say the least. Having a lot of experience in scrapbooking has taught me that only an image editing program can truly do all the steps necessary to produce a good scrapbook page. The easiet and best of these programs is definitely Paint Shop Pro. Try to find version 9, which was produced before the unfortunate takeover of Jasc software by Corel. You will be amzazed at what you can do with this program and how easy almost everything can be accomplished."
1,I am disappointed :(,"I purchased this product very recently, in fact it was only a week ago. I saw this product and give it a try thinking it will be a lot easier to do a scrapbook with all the pre-made pages plus it says this can make a DVD PICTURE TV SLIDE SHOW. Scrapbooking is ok as long you're fine to use regular 8-1/2 x 11"" paper but if you intend to use the 12 x 12, don't buy this. Just imagine most of the regular printer sizes only prints 8-1/2 or legal size bond paper and NOT 12 x 12"". My biggest frustration is using the Picture TV Slide Show, it is easy to MAKE but NOT to BURN/TRANSFER IT to a CD/DVD. It requires another program, known as NERO, which is about 120 MB for a TRIAL VERSION ONLY (30 days). If your trial version expires, you will need to download it again otherwise, you will need to buy it. This program CANNOT detect your own CD Writer program. Don't waste your money, there might be a better product than this, I hope."
4,Nova Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 3.0,"Very easy to use, lots of clips and templates. Loading glitch won't let disc 3 load, have to use program with disc 3 in the CD tray. Otherwise very happy with the program."
3,Wonderful Fun and Lots of Great Craft Options,"I am creating my first scrapbook for my new granddaughter and just love this software. It has everything you could want ie: stickers, embellishments, papers, and easy to use templates for every type of activity you could possibly want. The possibilites are limitless!I am so glad I purchased this and I don't have to run to the store everytime I need something. It offers many layouts. I just chose the one I want, and double-click to add my own photo.It is much faster than cutting out each photo. I do use some cutouts, so I can create a multi-textured look. It is a time saver and the end result is breathtaking."
1,Too many bugs and glitches to mention,I used this software to do a scrapbook for my mother for her birthday.First of all the software takes up a HUGE amount of space! Like 1600MB. The program is so slow and I have a relatively new computer. After about 4 pages in one file it becomes impossible to work with and then crashes. I had two files - 6 pages - crash and the work was gone. All the work gone. The text editor will add typos and put in and take out spaces. Sometimes it works great other times you have to restart your computer. Once it added bright green lines where I had added all of the embellishments to the page - everything other than the background. I had to redo it. Piece of JUNK! but what does print on a color laser - don't try it with inkjet - looks great.
5,"Best, Creative Scrapbook Software There Is","I bought this software for my wife for Christmas. The quality of this software is outstanding. It is simple to use, but has many, many features. I would recommend this software for anyone who likes to scrapbook, but also for those who enjoy doing anything with pictures. You can make calendars, greeting cards, birthday cards etc., as well as flyers. The price for this software is very cheap for the quality and the amount you get from it. It is a must."
2,Frustrating,"I bought this program over the weekend. Within minutes of importing my digital photos, the program seized up. After restarting my computer and spending time producing a 2-page layout, it froze again. This time, when trying to recover the page, it was shown as ""corrupt"" and would not launch at all. I had to redo everything.While the program has many cool features and elements, I cannot recommend it to anyone."
1,no support from publisher,My copy would not install. I emailed the publisher who refused to believe that there was a problem.
5,I love this scrapbook product,I love to scrapbook. When I am doing my own scrapbook I still have to go on to the computer and pick and print my pictures. With this program I do it all on the computer and get the same finished prodct. I work a couple of books together one with the computer and one with all my own supplies. Keeps my creative memories and stampin up products in use while I can put something together a little quicker when needed with this program.Have a blast with it ~ I do!
2,"Slow, SLOW","Well, I have been using the HP Scrapbook Assistant which I love, but doesn't have any photo editing capabilities. After reading some (non-Amazon) online reviews I decided to spring for this software. It is the slowest software I have ever seen and in the two pages I've worked on, I have crashed it 3 times.All of the templates are 81/2 x 11 which makes no sense and there are no custom sizes available. The UI is very hokey and looks very old. It doesn't do a bad job, but it doesn't really do more than fair. I think they had a guarantee on the box ...I'm going to go find it...Update - by the way they refused to honor the 90 day satisfaction guarantee on the box so buyer beware!"
4,Cute and fun,"This is the only software I have ever seen in person or used. Overall I like it much better than traditional scrapbooking, which was getting way too messy, and my kids were always getting into it. This software is easy to use after playing around with it. Also, it allows you to import free or low-cost digital scrapbooking supplies from the internet. Most of the designs are CUTE, not pretty or beautiful, and many are downright cheesy. I found it very easy, CHEAP, and quick to print pages online at ScrapbooksToShare.com. Overall this is much easier and cheaper than traditional scrapping."
5,Excellent Aerial Photographic Book !,"This book is made following the same style of Cameron's ""Above"" Series. Lots of old pictures compared to new ones, where you can see how much has HK changed in a short time. Amazing pictures of the skyscraper architecture of this outstanding city, aerial views of Central HK, Kowloon, the new airport, New Territories. This is a MUST HAVE book. One of the BEST aerial pictures book I have ever bought."
2,I returned it.,"The picture of this ring makes it look much thicker like that of a comfort fit band. It is not that thick. The 14k was not very yellow, I think I'd prefer and 18k. I returned it."
4,Zombie Doom,"I have seen the import version of this film under the title VS 3. WOW! For being shot on video, this film packs a whallop! Gory violence, mayhem,and other weird undescrible items! Don't try to understand the plot it is not necessary. Just enjoy the mayhem!"
1,Zombie Doom,"this is the worst movie ever!!! it looks like it was filmed on someones motocross track. the acting.....what a sec, this isnt acting...this is a joke. i think they did the dubbing in someones bathroom with the lights out. i cant believe this was burned to a disc. im so glad i got it used. i pitched in the trash cause no one i know(or dont for that matter) should see this. folks, this movie is so bad that MST3K wouldnt touch it. i love zombie movies and this is a disgrace. like i said before.............WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!"
1,"Awful, Awful Movie.","Another dollar bargain rack comedy. I would suggest getting this movie ONLY if you find it for less than a few dollars. I found it at tower records for seven bucks. Man I got ripped off. And how does something this terrible get inside a store anyways? Its only worth it to laugh your tail off at how bad this film really is. No budget, same voice on almost ALL the characters, no direction, lame pointless story, TOTALLY misleading title. I warn you, DO NOT buy this for more than a dollar or two. That really is all it is worth."
2,oh come on now....,"The dubbing was so bad, I couldn't last through Zombie Doom without a headache, and Zombie 90, which is also featured on this DVD, has even worse dubbing. I wish it was in subtitles, Germans speaking German would probably be better than...americans speaking american..ha!one star for the FX and gore.and the other star goes for the trailers, theyre trailers for soft core porn. It's good stuff."
2,DVD Doom,"Some people have the idea that this is the goriest movie ever. Well, its not... Not even close. If you are looking for real gore check out Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, Re-Animator, Verus, Premutos or anything by Takashi Miike. This movie looks like a home video and horribly dubbed. This movie is so bad it is funny which is the only reason I give it two stars. If you want a good gory film look elsewhere. If you have money to waste and have every other good gory film then check it out for the laughs. Just don't expect more than a home video full of red caro syrup."
1,The worst 'GORIEST HOME VIDEO' ever made... bad...bad...bad,"Bad actors, do I said actors?! Bad filming... no continuity. Fimed in 'super VHS camcorder'. Nothing professional here. Just a 'BOZO' who makes some bad effects and more bad effects. It doesn't exist a word to say how it's awfull. Go on with texas chainsaw, braindead, nekromantik but oh god please... don't even rent that [...]!!!BOUUU BOUUU!!! I got 3 years in film studing and I know what I'm saying. Your mother can do better!This crew is Amateur."
1,Complete waste of money and space,"I was simply buying laminate sheets at the office supply store, putting my item in between two sheets, and trimming it with scissors. I bought this machine so I could stop doing that. Well, I'm back to the old way. This machine does absolutely nothing. It fell apart on the first attempt of using it.Do yourself a favor and get a heat operated one. This is a waste of money, and shelf space."
2,Good.... for now,"I have had one of these tanks that I have used for the past few years, they work well, however the self ratcheting reel is a pain because it gets caught on the the bearings especially with 36 exposure or longer film because the film is curling, funnels don't always lock into place, have to be super glued frequently to make sure it is light safe for putting in the chemicals. Coming from an experienced film photographer, I would suggest investing in a high quality stainless steel developing tank with the stainless steel NON RATCHETING reels if you are going to be using it alot. They are most of the time cheaper, more durable, and last much longer."
2,Not what I expected.,This tank was suppose to have the easy reels and it turned out to be something different and I was dissatisfied.
1,I haven't recieved this product yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I would like to say I have been buying things from Amazon awhile. But I have a bead taste in my mouth about this order. I have emailed the seller a number of times. And have not gotten a response yet. What can I don about that?
1,Ace Photo Digital,"Ace Photo Digital is the type of company that goes on vacation for almost a week, has no intentions of selling you an item, and blows you off until you call them. They used the bait and switch tech on me saying that the package I bought was a mistake of amazons (which it wasn't) and they wouldn't honor my purchase. Very unprofessional company. Asked for a manager to call me, and never did. They do not care about their customers. It was a $150 camera w/ 2 lenses, tripod, flash, and case. They ended up canceling my order when I told them not to. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!"
2,Book is small,"This book is good, but very small in size. I thought for some reason it was going to be a normal size book."
2,Good illustrations but not really a story,"This book has no real story to it. It has nice illustrations but the story doesn't really make sense. It is good enough to hold the attention of my 12 month old, but I don't really think older toddlers will find it interesting enough for multiple readings. I had higher hopes for a Thomas the Tank Engine book."
5,All time favorite,"This is our third copy of this book. My children have literally loved this book to shreds. Even before children can speak words, they love to learn the sounds of animals -- especially easily identifiable farm animals. Thomas picks up cars filled with cows, pigs, horses, and ducks -- on each page, the child and I make the animal's sound. I am considering buying a couple more to save for the next generation of Thomas the Tank lovers"
5,this book creates smiles,I bought this book for my 15 month old cousin. He loved the book and wanted me to read it to him over and over again. Just looking at the book made him smile! This is a good little book for babies.
1,Misleading,"The book pictured and described is NOT the book I received. The copy of ""The Old Woman Who Lived in a Vinegar Bottle"" that I received from this seller is not by Rumer Godden, but retold by Ann Douglas. The book I received looks nothing like the one pictured. Gone is the 'little fish, little fish' - replaced by a flashy fairy. Not the story I remember from my childhood, not the book pictured on Amazon."
5,"A Reader from Dunnellon,Florida","I think this is a very good book to read. It is very interesting and keeps you reading until you are finished! It is very heartwarming and a good human interest book. I have read other books whick Patrick D. Smith wrote whom co-authored this book, and I enjoy his style of writing. I know Glen (Pee Wee) Mercer, personally and he has more courage than anyone I have ever meet!"
1,Book,Disappointed in this book. Not A Patrick D. Smith book that's for sure.Make sure he is the author only.
5,Awesome.,"I got this book on Christmas Eve, and I started reading it the day after Christmas. I tried not to finish the book in one day, I really did. But the book was just too good, I just had to know what happened next. I'm a die hard Dekker fan, and he didn't let me down.Great book. Just read Black, Red, and White before these."
3,Simple Summer Reading,"I would describe this book as a ""easy, summer read."" The characters were very simple,not alot of depth to them but I felt the details to descriptions ie. creatures, travels, forest was above the average in this book."
5,I love Dekker!,"I am not disappointed at all. I love this.... and this book has ministered, inspired and entertained. Love it!"
5,The Tie That Binds,"I received both Chosen and Infidel (bk. 2 of the series) in the mail at noon. I finished reading them (yeah, both) at 6:00. I couldn't put them down. This series is the tie that binds the Circle Trilogy (Black, Red, White) to Dekker's other works. Ted is a master at cliffhangers and totally unexpected twists and now he's taken it to a whole new level by interweaving storylines over multiple books. It's absolutely awesome. If Dekker keeps up this pace throughout the Books of History Chronicles, it will be on par with C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia and J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings."
4,Definitely Young Adult,"Did you know this is a young adult book? I didn't, until I read it. I kept thinking it was written for a younger audience, lacking the maturity of the original Trilogy, and then I saw on the back cover that I was right. For a young adult series, it's not at all bad. However, one can not even begin to understand this series without having first read the original Circle Trilogy and its sequel, Showdown, which are definitely not young adult fiction. I can't quite grasp why an author would try to change his audience in the middle of a storyline.Don't get me wrong; for young adult fiction it's a good read. It's just not cut from the same block as the other relevant works.Some have said that this is not a spin-off of the original Circle Trilogy. They don't know what they're saying. This series is solidly based in the original trilogy and can not be fully understood apart from it."
4,"Good book, entertaining, recommended reading.","Good story, Dekker rights well. Not what I call a 'page burner', but close to it. I enjoyed it, over all. At times I was frustrated with the characters because they didn't do what I considered to be logical things, but maybe Dekker meant it to be that way. I found myself drawn into the story and interested in what happened next. The book reads as if it is for late teens. It may be advertised as such, but I'm older and enjoyed it just the same. I would recommend the book. I read the Black, Red, White series and there a tie ins. I like that series more, but not a by a large margin. If you read the B-R-W series you would proabably enjoy The Lost Books series."
4,A New Epic,"This story begins in the middle! Actually in the middle of the trilogy, during a period when Thomas Hunter eats the fruit so that he doesn't dream. This series introduces a brand new cast of characters to Ted Dekker's trilogy with Darsal, Billos, Johnis and Silvie, four teenagers assigned the task of finding the lost books of history by the Roush.Love, the great romance, and loyalty underscore the startling, twisting developments of the plot. Its quick pace and incredible intricacies make this a page turner. Completely riveted, I read them all in rapid fire succession!"
4,A Great quick read for new and old fans,"I have read almost everything ted dekker has written and his circle trilogy is some of my favorite dekker material. Chosen is a great book that begins a great series, filling in some time between the original trilogy books.Right away you fall in love with the main hero and his companions. The story is fast and the plot sweeps you away, desperate to know what happens with all that is at stake.My only complaint is that the book wasn't a little longer with more character development, but it is targeted for young adults. Nonetheless, the plot is excellent and I couldn't wait for the next 3 when I was done. Highly recommended"
5,Another great book,"I own all books written by Ted dekker and i had started getting bored with the themes in Skin, Showdown, Saint and House. This however was a refreshing take back to white, black and red. See the story from a different perspective."
5,Awesome Book,"This book is a riveting Apocalypse story. It has all the classics love, honor, horror, and disease. But, it has something new and unusual that is hard to capture. When a legend comes true and is as horrify as Teeleh or as cute as a Roush it is an awesome combination. If you are into books that probably wont happen, but are action packed you'll love this book.Chosen (The Lost Books)"
5,Pulled me right in!,"I happened to be walking through the YA section at my local library when the Lost Books series caught my eye. They were on the bottom shelf, and just looked like they were dying to be read. I picked up books 1-4, not realizing there were 6 in all. I put them in order and opened up Chosen. 113 pages later, I looked at the clock. I couldn't believe how fast I was getting through this book.The story is captivating. The characters are believable, and each has their own struggle, and own personality. This was the first Ted Dekker book I've ever read, and I am hooked. I don't particularly go for Christian authors. I just read whatever sounds interesting to me. But Dekker's writing helped me realize what I do and don't like in a book. He, to me at least, is the perfect author."
3,Only two of these are the original tracks.,"Although only two are the original recordings, most of the others that were recorded later still sound pretty good and close to the original sound. But if you're a purist, stay clear of it."
5,The most uplifting spiritual guide available!,"Eva Bell Werber has an incredible gift in sharing encouraging words from the Lord. Never a day goes by that ""In His Presence"" doesn't add some meaning to life. Bell opens up the doors allowing the presence of the Lord to enter and guides the reader to a higher understanding of what it means to truly have a relationship with the loving Father. This book worships the Lord. Soak it up!"
5,"If you want to be closer to Spirit, get this book","Reading this is like having a tender, loving, personalSpiritual friend...better than Jimminy Cricket on your shoulderin the guise of conscience...this book helps enlighten, upliftand heal. I've been using it for more than 20 years andall the Werber books are the top of my vast book list as FAVORITES! Try it, I believe you'll cherish it as I do."
1,Amateur Musicians (not playing in tune) & Poor Sound Quality,I'm an experienced musician who plays actively in a German band and have listened to 4 other German band CD's that are 100% better. This is the poorest one I've heard yet! I've also heard better music by German bands at various German festivals and clubs.
1,Also received the wrong CD.,"I ordered this CD, and it had the wrong CD inside the correct cover. I returned it and reordered, and had the same problem again. I do not recommend buying this."
2,What an out of tune miss of notes really funny CD,"The quality of this CD is horrible. Between the out of tuneness and missed notes it's quite a CD. But don't get me wrong, its a fun CD to listen to. That is if you are in the mood for a good laugh!"
1,The Best of German Brass,"Oompah, oompah, oompah!It's not ""The Best of The German Brass"". That's another group which really is brass. This isn't! I wish I read the reviews first!"
1,"NOT THE ORIGINAL HITS,","These are the Original artists but, Not the original hitsThese have been rerecorded, New versions, Don't Waste YourMoney, only a handful of these are the originals,"
1,"Adnretti, an American Racing Icon","A totally comprehensive account of Mario Andretti's racing career and the machinery that took him to the top of world-wide motorsport. Completely unvarnished and truthful about the ups and downs of a racing driver's life, this is a must-have book for the boomer-generation racing fan."
5,"One of the most excellent ""dc Talk"" albums relesed sofar !!!","This band is once again reaching over the balance of Secular and Christian community with thier album ""Supernatural"". The songs have reached a new level in the talent of the band not only musically but also vocally with Tobys great solo's. Not only does ""dc Talk"" reach the youth of today but also brings many family's together with the clean message of Love and Happieness."
5,THIS C.D. IS TOTALLY A SUPERNATURAL ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have grown up listening to D.C.Talk and all their c.d.s rock. I think they are going to be like the BEATTLES!!!!!!!!! In fact, I think they are. If you haven't bought this c.d. you better because you are missing out if you don't. So do all of us ""JESUS FREAKS"" a big favor and buy this ""SUPERNATURAL"" c.d."
4,A true CONCERT album,"I have listened to dc talk since their ""Heavenbound"" days and every CD has amazed me not only for their variety but their immense talent as well. Supernatural, though a bit watered down lyrically, is great in its energy and music. This album will make an AMAZING concert! ""Dive"" is the best track with its energetic drive and ""Into Jesus"" has the religious appeal that made them famous. If you want serious rock intertwined with some soft tracks, pick Supernatural up....or wait for the concert!"
5,The best band ever!!,"I haven't heard the CD yet, but I saw dc Talk in concert this summer and their new songs blew away anything from Jesus Freak!!! Buy the album people, christian or not!!"
2,Disappointing and melodramatic,"I leaned a few new things in this documentary - mainly the Japanes researcher who's come up with a way to create a 3D image of a volcano's internal structure using muons generated by cosmic rays decaying when they strike the Earth's atmosphere. Cool! But aside from that, the informative content was rather low - more akin to something one would see on the Discovery Channel than the once-great Nova series (no offense to the DSC). The rest of the doc was repetitious and the narrative a bit dumbed-down and hyperbolic. All those flaws were magnified by the over-the-top melodramatic music. Really awful. I'd feel my intelligence was insulted if I were a high school kid, much less an adult.NOVA, please stop trying to out Discovery Channel the Discovery Channel. You will lose that battle, as well as what used to be your other core audience - intelligent, scientifically literate viewers."
3,"If you are a fan of Zombie movies, see this","This movie has a lot of bad qualities, but it has a lot of good also. It has horrible dubbing, a horrible story line and horrible acting. HOWEVER, if you are a fan of zombie movies, then you have to see this one. It has all the blood and gore for three movies. More exploding heads, amputations and decapitations than i have ever seen. I do believe that this is the goriest movie i have ever seen. It beats DEAD ALIVE by a stretch. rent it. You won't be disappointed."
3,Oh boy this is fun.,"I can not believe I like this junk, it's shoddy stuff from start to end, but I love it.From the son who is 40 but acts like he's 10 to the ol mans buddy who throws up on every one.I don't want to give away to much since I want you to set threw it like I did, so find the cheapest used copy you can dig up and check it out.Barry"
4,house to hard,"I heard one of the songs on here at a club and took forever to find it. Laurent Wolf has produced several songs that are used widly by other djs and often. But he is rarly heard of in the US. The cd starts out with house and as the cd goes on, it gets faster and a little harder. It's rare music, so it's something different, it makes you want to get up and dance and it comes with mixed and a unmixed cd, great for DJ's."
5,Excellent seller!,Shipping was reasonable and the item arrived in the condition as described. I was very pleased with my book and recommend buying from this seller!
5,BLUES LIKE DAD DID IT!,"THIS IS A SUPERB CD! EDDIE JR. HAS A STRONG RESEMBLENCE TO HIS DAD, EDDIE TAYLOR, IN HIS PLAYING AND SINGING. GREAT HORNS ADD TO HIS BEAT, BUT HE HAS THE OLD CHICAGO BLUES RHYTHM STILL THERE. WHAT A TERRIFIC DEDICATION CD TO HIS FATHER, WHICH HIS MOM AND BROTHERS ALSO ARE ON HERE TOO! ONCE YOU HEAR 1 SONG, YOU ARE HOOKED . I LOVE THE JIMMY REED SONGS AND EDDIE TAYLOR SONGS HE RE MADE ALSO! JUST A PERFECT CD!"
1,Didn't get a chance,"We have recently bought a cement block home and needed to upgrade our regular drills to a hammer drill. While looking and reading reviews of hammer drills offered by Amazon I came upon this Milwaukee 5381-20 8.5 Amp 1/2 inch Hammer Drill at the incredible price of $7.95 + shipping of $10.95. I couldn't believe my luck, figured it was either a typo, or one off deal. No worries I have nothing to lose either way.This morning I was informed by Amazon that Tool Supply inc., was unable to deliver to my address. So what's the deal here? I live in the Arizona, still part of the USA. No explanations!As a long time customer, at this moment in time, I am not a happy camper."
3,A fine textbook..if you can understand clinical case studies,"I found this book to be of value. As a special education major with an emphasis on children with severe disabiities I found there was a lot of information in this book.But due to the style of writing contained here, it is more of a reference book than something a student can use to gain quick knowedge of their field."
2,Text for functional classroom,"Personally I am unsure why we had to buy this required text in the first place. Our instructor said that the information in it was outdated, so she used her own information in lecture instead. I would not recommend purchasing this book-if it's outdated, why buy it?"
2,On time but damaged,The textbook arrived very quickly. The condition of thsi product was marked in good to like new. After one night of using this book the binding came apart. It looks trashy carrying around book in two pieces. I would have rather spent the money at the bookstore on a book that would have lasted through the school sememster and had a better resale value.
2,half link,"the chain im pairing these with was 88 links 3/32 single speed chain. 10+ years old i baught 3 half links to bring the chainout to 89 1/2 links. broke the entire chain apart, wet sand & buff, the half links just got a light sandmaybe i did not get the chain back toghter tightly enough, i have busted two links in three days, bending a link ortwo from the chain down. to the last link, i'm going to try another fullfilment. to replace these links."
4,great,"It's really a great combo for the price. the clamp on is just the right size, what it does lack that I've seen in others is a magnet to hold it so you can free your hands, but you get used to it.The multi-meter is really bulky, that said it can take a beating."
4,Great table for the price,This is a very nice table if you don't want to spend a ton of money. It took about ten minutes to attached the legs and then it was ready to go. Looks great and we've enjoyed using it. It's a smaller table so if you want more than four people to sit there it's probably too small for you. But it's perfect for smaller patios like we have. I'm very happy with the table.
4,Table review,"The table looks great and was very easy to put together. It came a few days later than the chairs I ordered, and I had to call a delivery warehouse place here to arrange the delivery time but they were very easy to work with and came the same day I called in the timeframe specified. I'm happy with it!"
4,Good quality for the price,"The table is fairly sturdy and came in good shape. It was easy to assemble and looks good. All in all, we are pleased with it."
4,Solid wood - Ultra Fast Shipping,"If you want a wooden outdoor table for a smaller patio area, this is your answer. It is solid wood - looks great and for $99, you can't beat it. Assembly is a snap. 4 legs with 2 screws each. You can assemble it in about < 10 minutes. I ordered it on Monday and it was delivered on Friday - shipping was $10.Yo Go Amazon!Incidentally, someone else wrote about rain and the finish washing off. It poured Friday afternoon and nothing washed off.Maybe they've solved that problem."
4,Love it but wish it had an off switch!,"My son loves this little gadget! I bought it for him for teething purposes, since he tried to take his cousin's the last time he cut a tooth. It's great for car rides. My only issue is there isn't an off switch, so when he's done playing with it, it still vibrates. Which wears out the batteries super fast! It's a good thing their replaceable :/"
1,teething choking hazard?,How can they sell a teething toy and put a choking hazard warning on it? Isn't that oxymoronic? Is it for teenagers getting thier molars?
2,BAD QUALITY,sound quality very bad - upon taking it out of the box it had an odd sound - almost as if it had been damaged in some way - definitely overrated and I expected a much higher quality product.
1,good teething toy,"I was really looking forward to getting this teether/buzzer for my granddaughter since the reviews looked promising but was very disappointed because the buzzer and music stopped working after only 2 days. I phoned the company, Mother to Child and left a message 4 days ago and have not heard anything yet. too bad"
2,eh,"this toy is okay. nothing special. definitely doesn't do magic, like I was lead to believe from the packaging. in fact from the moment we opened it...the buzzer function started dying out...now it does half a buzz. I may have to return it. it's also way to heavy for my 3-month old."
1,TWO thumbs down!!!!,My son is almost 8 months old and is working on two teeth. When I saw this toy I thought it might be the answer. He didn't like it from the beginning. It is really heavy and kind of bulky. It vibrates so hard if you lay it down it moves around like a beeper. He hated it so much we took it back the very next day.
5,Wonderful play value,"We adopted my son from Ukraine at 6 months old. We were advised to take a music toy. As most toys play incredibly annoying childrens songs we were searching for something we could stand. Oleg is now 18 months and has gone from just staring at the flashing eyes, to teething and now works the buttons himself. It is the toy that he chooses when he goes in the carseat over and over. The music is wonderful, a selection of liszt, beethoven, mozart and others."
3,This toy is not so bad! We liked it!,"I read the reviews and thought that folks were too hard on it. My son is 4 months old and we recieved this as a gift before he was born. It is heavy and he can not lift it, but the music is great! For the price, this is a toy that I would recomend. The music selections are beautiful and they are long- which gives our son a better idea of the music. The reason that I would not give it a higher rating is because I dropped it and the vibrator now raddles loudly, my son still likes it, but something inside is broken."
3,Waste of money,"I purchased this toy based on reviews from another site for my 3+ month old daughter. Within 1 month (and with not much use) it was broken. Fun? Ok, so it vibrates...and? Educational value? I know I didn't learn anything from this toy. Durability? Non-existant. Buy Leapfrog products if you wish to have true fun, durablity, and valuable learning skills instilled in your child."
2,Ordered 2 - neither worked right,I ordered 2 of these as gifts as this was my son's favorite toy as an infant. They arrived quickly but neither worked properly. I reported this issues and my money was refunded promptly.
4,Overall a very good product,"I bought it for 2 specific reasons: Range & (mainly) Reliability. The last router that I had had connectivity issues. Many a times it had to be reset in order to get connected. Well this one, its up and running since I have plugged it in. If it adds some value there is another fact too. If you have heard of Magicjack, it is recommended that the computer, Magicjack is attached to shouldn't be on wireless internet. Well this is no longer a problem for me now. Thanks to this router my mini to which Magijack is attached, is accessing internet wireless and is up and running seamlessly.However I didn't find the range much attractive. looks like range is still same - more or less. Possibly the signal strength has increased but not the range.Pros: Wireless Reception, Speed, Reliability, ConnectivityCons: Only aesthetic - Blue lights - its like having a disco at home (After a couple of month of use, I am gonna cover it with a tape or something)"
2,Wonderful in theory,"Have had a D-Link 615 for several years, and have been nothing but pleased with the unit. Sticking with brands that have done great things for me, I purchased the D-Link 655 to increase the wireless bandwidth throughout the house. It was super simple to set up, and it was wonderful while it worked. It would drop connections to the internet frequently, requiring a reboot every couple of hours. I tried upgrading the firmware, playing with the frequencies, the speeds, disabling the 5GHz options, and it continued. Finally had to return the product. Fortunately, Amazon is great on their return policies."
2,Less than a year and starting to give out,It was great while it lasted but now it is starting to randomly turn off. I have to plug it back in multiple times to get it to boot up again. I don't think I will be buying any more products from the DLink brand; they just don't last very long.
2,Very Unreliable,This router was easy to setup and it was cheap and those are the only two redeeming qualities. The signal is unreliable. When we have multiple devices on it becomes very slow and sometimes doesn't work at all. I have had to reset it several times.
5,Love It,"This router was easy to set up and works great, speed is good with multiple users. I am really satisfied with this purchase."
1,Slow wireless,"I just bought a new DIR-655 and the wireless is basically worthless. I have toggled every setting I could find. The wireless is slow whether it is from device to the internet through a cable modem or device to device just through wireless. I get 12 Mb if connected to the ethernet and 1.5 MB (barely more than 10% of the same speed) with wireless. The previous DIR-615 is starting to go out, crashing every day, but after a reboot, the DIR-615 is 12 MB with wireless.Either I got a bad device or this is a bad design."
4,Good Gigabit-enabled Wireless Router,"This product was used to replace a Linksys Wireless-N router on the premise that wireless speed might be enhanced. It was enhanced! Wireless transmission improved a measurable 23%, and of course the gigabit connections helped with hardwired appliances. Manual set up was intuitive. The USB feature is useable, although connections via the D-Link utility take up to 5 minutes for accessibility to start, and a couple minutes to disconnect. The one gripe is that the indoor transmission range is no more than 30-ft. through walls."
5,D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router,The router was easy to install and has worked flawlessly since it was activated. It does the job it was purchased for effortlessly.
4,pretty good signal through walls,"I bought this unit so that guest in a spare bedroom could access the internet. Its about 60 ft away, and through several walls. I was pleased to find that I got a 50% signal. I tried placing it in a window with a line of sight view of the guest room, but the metal hurricane shutter apparently blocked the signal. I moved the unit away from the window, behind a drywall, insulated, brick veneer wall, and this goes through a insulated roof and a paneled curtain wall in the guest room, and still gives a 50% signal. I'm happy with the result."
2,Returned,Returning for a couple reasons. First the router needed to be reset every morning for the three days I used it because the wireless quit broadcasting the network. Secondly one of my kids older laptops was incompatible which I could have lived with had it not been for the first problem. Sticking with Linksys.
3,D-Link DIR-655 wireless router,Wasn't as easy as 1-2-3-4 setting up.. After a whole day of trying different set ups it finally worked. It takes between 2 and 5 tries and up to 15 minutes to get on the internet. A real pain....
3,Don't be afraid to exchange it,"Product works very well if it is not defective. But in my experience D-Link product have higher defect rate than other brands. I spend two hours in frustration trying to make it work before deciding to exchange and replacement unit worked like a charm in 15 min. Likely Amazon has great exchange policies: they ship you replacement immediately without waiting for returned unit. So if you think it does not work very well when you got it, just exchange for new unit. Probability of getting 2 defective once in a row is extremely small. And, as always, don't forget to update firmware on new unit before setting it up."
1,Why did I actually buy TWO of them?,"I bought two of them. The first failed last fall, and I liked something about this router so much that I simply bought a 2nd one, even though the first was still under warranty. The wireless communication slowed to a crawl and would speed up after a power cord removal and replacement kind of re-boot. Then the wireless communication failed entirely. So, I went to Fry's and bought the 2nd one. Now, it is about 6 months later, and the wireless communication is failing again in much the same way. I ought to have it repaired, just to punish the manufacturer, but what a hassle! I don't really wish to spend hours on the phone with their customer service, just to have them tell me what I already know.So, I'm now researching for another router, but it certainly won't be a Dlink of any kind."
2,Not happy with the DIR-655,"I purchased the DIR-655 with expectations of screaming WI-FI....what I got was a unit that had to be restarted twice a day as it would just lose contact with all my devices. Reset and you'd be good for a few hours and then BAM, lost again. I tried D-Link tech support and we tried all kind of different settings to no avail. Strange thing with this unit is we had issues trying to stream audio from any of our notebooks to our Yamaha Network A/V Receiver, heck I always thought it was an issue with our notebooks as I could still ""control"" the functions of the reciever through the Yamaha Web Interface through my DIR-655, I just couldn't stream my music. This went on for 7 months.....Finally I threw in the towel and put my old trusty Belkin 54G back up. No drops, and I can control and STREAM my audio files. Sorry D-Link, I gave you a shot and it didn't pan out."
4,nice router,"I am not to savy with a computer but the D-link is very easy to install and set up. I have had no problems with it yet, and I can us my ipod anywhere in the house."
1,D-Link Dir-655 Router,"I was extremely satisfied with the seller of this product, but the product did not live up to its advertised expectations. I spent over 4 hours trying to make this router work, and I'm not a novice. I took my first programming course in 1962. YES 1962!!! After many attempts to make this router work and visiting the manufacturers website to manually install or automatically install it I gave up. It should take no longer than 10 to 12 minutes to make a router work and reset the password and name your network. The Seller of this router and Amazon responded quickly and my money was refunded immediately. Thanks Amazon. I will definitely use Amazon for future purchases for additional products, but just not a D-Link Router."
4,Good product awesome range,Good product awesome range This ia a great buy for the price. I have had no negetive issues with this product.
3,Decent home router,"I purchased this MIMO router for the following benefits over my previous Linksys router. It should provide better performance, MIMO (Multiple-Input/Multiple-Output), Gigabit interface and a built-in usb drive. I gave three stars because it works well when everything is fine. However, whenever you try to update the setting on the router, it would reboot itself for the update to take effect. It usually takes 20 seconds to 90 seconds, in various tasks such as updating the policy, schedule to a simple admin user password."
3,"Good basic router, but...","Upgraded from DIR-614 - it just couldn't keep up with my family's increasing streaming/gaming demands.DIR-655 work fine for us so far - no dropped connections and signal much stronger than the old one.My problem is with configuration UI - it is straight from last century and very buggy, up to the point been totally useless...A Bottom line - DIR-655 is a good basic router, but if you need advanced configuration for parental control or other tasks look elsewhere"
4,DLINK DIR 655 Extreme N - Extreme,"Replaced G and this router rocks. The user interface is easy with someone with some configuration experience in home networks. Only one major issue and specific to my environment - my previous router successfully issued an DHCP address to an IP LAN phone. The Extreme and my IP Lan phone don't talk well; meaning, the IP address is being sent but the IP Lan phone can't receive it. So, someone's firmware is either too high or too low or both. I would buy again and recommend. And, the matching USB network dongles work great with the Extreme"
5,Great Product,After careful review of all the major draft n wireless home networking routers I decided on the D-Link 655 as it seemed the best bang for the buck. The product had a great quick start guide and software that made the install very easy. The only hang-up I had was with the Network Magic software that is included. It is great software for a beginner but it does use quite a bit of memory and it had a small problem with sharing large folders (with lots of files) that I had to fix at the registry level (after reviewing the FAQ problems section). I have CA for a software firewall and the suggestions from Network Magic worked perfectly.I have been using the DIR-655 for almost a month without problems or needing a reboot. It is very fast with my wired and wireless devices. I highly recommend it.
2,Not very pleased,This router worked ok for first few days then it constantly dropped the wireless connection to the router an had to be reset. Very frustrating. What I determined was the DLink has an issue with WPA encryption. I reset up my old wireless G Dlink with WPA and it too kept loosing connection. When I back set it to WEP it worked fine. SO I sent back the DLink N router for a refund.I would not recommend this router.
1,Died in 3 days.,"I bought this router based on some excellent reviews that I read online. However, my experience with this router was all bad. It did not play nice with my Mac Book Pro. It was always having a hard time establishing a connection with the router. It worked okay once I turned off Ipv6 on my Mac Book, but I had to do a ton of troubleshooting to find that solution. Even then it still had intermittent connection issues. Then on day 3, the router died completely. No power, no lights, no data, nothing. I tried a couple of different outlets to make sure it wasn't a bad socket. It wasn't. The router just died. I would not recommend this router to anyone, and I'll be looking at other options for a replacement."
1,Failed after two months,Failed after three months. First everything worked fine. Automatic setup software didn't. After two months the USB port started failing ever 30 seconds- turned that off. Then the ports would lose conections. Reinstalled my old unit everything worked fine.
5,d-link router 655,router was very easy to hook up just put in the disk and it will walk you right through.downloading was no problem where ever i was in the house it was fast.
1,D-Link router,This router didn't provide the range I needed and it often dropped the etherenet cable connection. I think it was defective.
3,D-link router 655 version 2,"I give 3 star for the 2nd version D-link router 655.Actually it is the second version with new firmware packed in new blue box while the first one is in orange box. It receives 3 star because of the change of input voltage. Most of new electronic devices support input range from 100 to 240v, however the new D-link router input is only 110 to 120v while the 1st version is full compatible with 100 to 240v."
2,Not impressed,"Range is not as strong as i expected, it did not work well in my home as the range did not improve much over the old wireless-G router i had."
2,A flawed long term use hardware problem?,On my first Netgear product.Wireless Linksys failed completely after 19 months.D-Link d655n also pooped out the wireless after 17 months.So wireless failed before 2 years on both.Now on Netgear....flawlessly so far. (lol LIEFTIME WARWRANTY they Say)So my question is: Wassup with running wireless on these products? Is 7/24 and heavy use a problem?JP.S. yeah no time for collecting/sending warranties. Online 24/7 so went out and grabbed a new one ASAP.Oh Yeah...Background: Have been building my own PC's since 1989. Not a newb to this.Any other hard ware suggestions?
1,trouble going to opposite side of house,I purchased this wireless router so I can use my laptop downstairs and the opposite side of the house from the router.It doesn't have any stronger of a signal than the cheap wireless router I was using. So for going the distance it isn't very good. Seems it goes up to 30 or so feet then looses signal.
3,Not so great with the Xbox 360,"The firmware had to be upgraded out of the box of course. I like some of the features, although the config can get fairly complicated. The Xbox 360 we have lags all over the place with this router installed. I have tried turning on/off QOS with no impact. Placing a Linksys instead makes the problem go away. Because of the kids, if I can't figure out the lagging/streaming issue, the Dlink will probably sit in a closet somewhere..."
5,Solid!,"This is a great wireless router and gigabit switch. I have not speed tested it yet but for the price, I am sure it will perform. I receive auto emails of the firewall logs, per my schedule. I wish it was DD-WRT supported."
1,By far the worst wireless router I have ever owned.,I performed the installation according to the instructions and loaded the setup software on my laptop and hardwired the router to my laptop to finish the setup. The router never connected with any of my wireless devices though I used the same security setup as the router I was replacing. I spent 3 hours trying to connect wirelessly to the router but could only communicate by a hardwired connection and never managed to get online. I even tried to run with no security at all and was never able to connect wirelessly. I have been installing wireless networks since the 'a' protocol came out and have never been more disappointed with a router.
4,D-LINK 655,"SO FAR SO GOOD. IT DID WHAT IT IS ADVERTISED FOR AND I AM ON WILDBLUE EXEDE AND I DO NOT HAVE TO REBOOT MY MODEM EVERY DAY LIKE I HAD TO WITH THE D-LINK 601 TO MAINTAIN MY DOWNLOAD AND UPLOAD SPEED. THAT IS NOT SAYING THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO DO IT, ALL I AM SAYING IT LASTS NOW THREE TO FOUR DAYS AS OPPOSED TO EVERYDAY OR MORE. AS FAR AS SPEED FOR THE DEVICE,WELL IT IS PRETTY GOOD AND FAR MORE RANGE THAN I HAD ON THE 601. SO TO WRAP IT UP,RIGHT NOW AS I WRITE THIS, IT IS WORKING VERY WELL FOR US...."
1,Unacceptable Range,"This is a one room router! Signal strength is so week it is almost useless. I got this for my garage which is 200 feet from my house. When I stand in front of my garage I get a stronger signal from the router in my house. What's worse, even my hard wired desktop computer now has a slower internet connection than my 12 year old Linksys. I get a better range with my bluetooth headset than I get with this thing. I am very unhappy with this router and strongly advise you to purchase something else. This thing is a joke and it's not very funny."
2,Not Happy,"I bought this and set it up, it doesn't provide a faster speed or farther range then my previous router it is the exact same, It was a waste of 72 dollars because I cant return it because it's opened I saw and heard such good reviews about it, I'm severely disappointed. If any one has any idea why this doesn't work as it should please help me out. I currently have AT&T; U-Verse Max internet and I was using the wireless router provided to me from AT&T.;Thanks."
1,Horrible Tech Support / Bad Router,"All I have to say is if you have time to deal with long hours on the phone and difficult people to understand, then D-Link Routers are for you. Further, If you enjoy constant internet wireless drops, and many times no internet at all, than D-Link is for you.I would not recommend this product to anyone, it does not accomplish what it claims, and this is the third one from tech support that I have had since the original order.Very Dissapointed with the companies policies on refunds, and tech support on their service.Will not buy any more D-Link in the future. Very Dissapointed!!!!"
1,worst router I ever had !!!,"Tis was the worst router I ever had. My current LAN speed is 30MBPS, you know how much speed this router provides when I connect it to my modem...hardly 4 MBPS.D-Link sucks bigtime !!!."
1,Very Bad,"i was looking for a Gigabit router to replace my 6 year old linksys. I was going by the reviews and didn't think it would be that bad, it is worse.It was easy to setup but when I connected I kept losing speed. On downloads I would start out great but they never finished as the connection slowly worksed itself down until it dropped.I called service and got hung up on bt 2 reps, the 3rd rep kept going over the same items and when i told him I was hooked up with a wire he insisted the issue was with the wireless settings.I got a level 2 tech and they went over the same things the first tech did, and this time started to demand what my public IP was, when I told him my linksys works be it slow and this thing goes up and down he kept saying it could be an issue with my connection.I'm going to return this and buy a netgear or linksys. Anything but a D-Link"
4,So far so good.,"I'm not a review writer, but as one other reviewer mentioned, there were some pretty negative reviews on this product particularly related to setting it up. I am only a moderately computer saavy person and the set up on this could not have been easier. I bought this router to improve my performance for streaming netflix through Roku and managed to set up the router, connect it to Roku, and then watch several episodes (with no stuttering!) all in an evening's work. So, while I can't comment yet in detail about performance, set up was a snap."
4,Fast but not fully Mac compatible,"This router is fast. I use it mostly for ethernet. I get about 80mb of my 100mb service though it. My old Netgear only gave me about 10mb. I get about 40mb in wireless mode. My old Netgear (g) only gave me 1mb. I keep wireless turned off most of the time because new research is showing that wireless can damage your DNA. I'd keep it at a good distance. I had difficulty in accessing the set-up menus on my Mac using FireFox, IE, and Safari. Lot's of can't find page or scrambled pages in IE. When I switched to Google Chrome the problem went away, and I like Chrome so it is not really a big problem. I also did fine from a Windows PC running FireFox and IE. So be careful if you have a Mac and are not prepared to use Chrome. It is not fully Mac compatible in that respect. It works fine for accessing the Web though, It is just setup that is a problem."
5,A great router!,"I connected this router to my home network in just a few minutes. Easy as pie. I have two WIN 98 PC's, one XP notebook, one Vista PC, one MacBook Pro, one iMac and a PS3. I am mixing 'N' with 'G' and so far it works great. If I encounter any problems I will update this review.I did use a cable to connect one of my WIN 98 machines but from what I've seen I don't need to wire any PC to the router to get it to work just fine. I did install the included software on this PC with ease.I tested the internet speed on each PC and it is by far faster than my old 2WIRE DSL modem/router that up and died on me.I highly recommend this router. Fast and easy to install."
3,Not for Network Printing,"This is a simple and powerful router, but I bought it for the USB port so I could network my printer, and this feature is not so good.This requires of download and installation of the Shareport utility, which is simple and elegant. You also have to update the firmware, but the dLink support site is pretty easy to use.But it doesn't work. It worked initially, and now has stopped (three days after purchase). DLink's solution is to uninstall and re-install the utility, and when that didn't work, to power cycle the router. These are not going to be great solutions if this is what I have to do every time I want to print.DLink's customer support is fantastic - 24/7, easy to get through, and knowledgable. I feel a lot like the guy with the heat problem (by the way, I don't have that issue) - I don't want to return this router, but I might have to.I've been fighting with my three windows laptops - I'm not eager to try to get the two MacBooks to print..."
5,Excellent Router,Got a good deal on this router. Setup took less than 10 minutes with CD Wizard disc. Very Good Range and router has worked flawless for the month I have had it. No compaints from me and I would recommend D-link Dir-655 to anyone looking for an upgrade from your basic wireless router.
1,Don't Buy D-Link,I know you are supposed to rate the product and not the company here but I cannot separate the 2.I am a network administrator and call tech support quite often. D-Link is one of the worse.D-Link products are OK and this router is good for most uses BUT if you have problems like I did you will suffer with their support. At some point D-Link execs decided that providing good support for their customers is not important. I could not disagree more. Just keep this in mind when buying D-Link.
1,Worst router so far.,"This router was such a peice of junk, that I don't see how they keep selling them. It was a nightmare to set up and took me forever to get it to communicate with my laptop. Then when I finally got it to see my laptop it ran so slow that it took a long time just to load a page. The dlink rep told me to return it, so I did and the second one did link up, but it dropped the connection all the time and was unusable. Then it kept getting worse and finally I couldn't even hard wire into it and get into the admin of it. I'm still looking for a n router that is actually fast and works. Wish I could rate it with no stars."
1,Beware of Win XP upgrades,"I had this router working fine until I did an update on my systems, then they stopped communicating with it. I was able to restore one of the systems back before the update, so it works again, but the other is still off-line in XP (Linux works OK).This is a known bug in a lot of router software and I am upset that a firmware fix is still not available. I would have to recommend avoiding any products from this company."
4,mostly very good,hardware and technology seem to be very nice and work great and good speed. the only issue i have is the web config seems very buggy and hasnt been updated since 2010 is what the update screen indicates.
2,Shareport doesn't work,"The router works ok, used it for surfing the internet only and even then it had moments of lag and web pages would sit and load for a long time periodically. The shareport feature never worked even after I tried to add it to the list of approved devices on my firewall settings. Customer support is a separate company from D-Link and wants you to pay money for any help offered. That was the deal breaker. My suggestion and next router, Airport Express (maybe Airport Extreme). Can print from both PC and Mac without relying on some bogus software that supposedly switches user control of the USB port (I'm sure that'll work reliably every time...)"
3,Doesn't work as advertised.,"It doesn't work as advertised...but what product does?I was at least hoping for a 10-15% improvement in coverage area over my previous Linksys WRT54GS 811G router, but I'm afraid that the coverage is about the same.The router was extremely easy to set up, and speeds are fine. I would still recommend this router to anyone that doesn't already have a wireless router...but if you are looking for better wireless coverage, you might be disappointed."
4,Super easy to install as replacement,I had an existing D-Link wireless router (DI-624) that had started to drop connections frequently. As I use this for work it was becoming a problem. Ordered the DIR-655 and found it super easy to install it in place of my old one because all you had to do was (1) plug all the cables into the very same slots as the old one and (2) run the setup CD and type in the same SSID and security key as the old one and .....that was it. My laptop was able to connect wirelessly on the first try. I am running 3 machines with Xp in case that makes a difference.I have not tried the USB printer option so have no opinion on that part.
2,Great when it works.. Brick when it doesn't,Works great then every few days starts to slow down and finally won't allow access to internet. You can hit other drives/computers on network but it won't let you out to the internet.Won't let you log into the router.. so you get to reset it so you can get it going again.I am seriously thinking about connecting a timer to the power supply to just cycle power every day at midnight.Nice features but not reliable if you need to depend on it for hosting services / remote networking back to your home etc.Disappointing.
2,OK Router - Horrendous support.,"The router is okay - nothing special about it.God help you if it's broken or you have trouble however. D-Link might list their support contact #s everywhere but it's a nightmare. Expect the following:1) Annoyed overworked underpaid condescending Indian Tech support - they can help you if and only if their checklist tells them what to do. You don't get true english speaking techs who know anything about networking until ""tier 2"". Expect to give out your name, phone number, router number, router serial at least twice before reaching one of them.2) ""Lost connections"" during the long holding times. Plenty of connections before you end up anywhere halfway productive."
2,Tough to configure with HughesNet,Found that the DIR-655 is very difficult to configure when using HughesNet satellite internet. Problem being that the router wants to confirm that you have an internet connection before allowing you to configure the router. The major problem is that HughesNet modems operate at 192.168.0.1 and the DIR-655 come configured at 192.168.0.1. Thus you have figure out how to change the IP address of the DIR-655 before you can get it to configure...and that takes some work. D-Link should make it very easy to change the IP address before configuring!!!
2,Couldn't Get Wireless Xp Portable to work,"Installed nicely, but I couldn't get my IBM Thinkpad Xp to work correctly. In both wireless and wired mode, the XP was extremely slow when using the browser. After hours, tech support was no help. I returned it and bought the Linksys WRT160N which worked immediately for all my computers including the XP. Also, the WRT160N seeemed to have better range (but not by much)."
3,Don't waste your money,"I bought this 2 months ago, because my wireless 802.b network did not have the range to cover the whole house. I was hoping that this router would increase the range by 20 feet. Not so!Despite good speed (130 Mps), there is no range increase and it is maddingly slow. It is also hard to set up. Only buy this if you are an expert. I had to get an electrician to run cap2 cable 50 feet, and a Network specialist to add an antenna. The signal is still only 2 bars. He said I may need a repeater.The problem is that I have an old house, with stucco walls, which play havoc with wireless.$400 later, I am no better than my wireless 802.b. Shame on me!"
5,Makes a great addition to existing router,"I have an ActionTec ""G"" router from Verizon that I need to keep in order for remote DVR and other FIOS TV features to work (and be supported). I wanted to add an ""N"" access point to my house, so I put this in an upstairs closet and ran a Cat5-E cable to it. I do know a bit about networking, so I skipped the CD and just opened the browser interface and set up the D-Link over my network.After matching the newly assigned SSID and WPA2 passphrase on my daughter's laptop the connection worked flawlessly. The signal is excellent anywhere in the house. I don't yet have a gigabit switch, so I couldn't test high speed transfers from our LaCie NAS.It may seem like overkill to use this simply as an access point, but the dedicated units aren't any less expensive and don't have great reviews. A power-over-ethernet unit would have avoided the need to put an outlet in the closet, but they cost a whole lot more and I don't have any POE switches to connect one to."
5,Wireless HD,"This is without a doubt one of the best routers for both wireless signal range and speed. Originally purchased to replace a 54G wireless router because a signal was not obtainable through a single wall, the Extreme N generated a maximum strength signal almost immediately on every wireless devices in the house. Even better, about a year later a WiFi Network Blu-Ray Player was dropped off by Santa and a few tweaks to set a Static IP made it possible to stream 1080p HD movies compressed in *.mkv files through this amazing router. Now an entire 500+ Blu-Ray movie archive is stored on a computer in my home office while all the movies are streamed wirelessly to a WiFi Network Blu-Ray Player in my living room. Thanks D-Link for making a product ahead of its time."
2,Buyer Beware-Rev B Version,"The D-Link Extreme-N is a great router-that's why this was the second one I have owned. However, Amazon ships the Rev B version of the router, which I understand is usually sold in non-US markets. I could not get the router to work with Apple Filing Protocol, nor does it support Apple's Time machine backup. But it's not just a Mac problem-the Rev B also has a bug that does not allow support for CIFS protocols. After numerous frustrating calls to D-Link support, I finally reached a second level support person who was aware of the problem and replaced the router with a Rev A version, which works wonderfully.Be sure to get Rev A, or buy elsewhere where you can."
2,"very poor range, in my house","After using this for a couple of months, I can only say I wish I had not wasted my money. The range is not half of what my 5 year old Netgear was. I can sit a room away, and it will say Very Low signal.Update: Jan 2012I finally gave up on this. I have been having to unplug it, wait half a minute, and then power it back up and wait while it resets itself, EVERY DAY.It did a decent job with the computer I have wired into it, but to use it for either a wireless laptop, or my wireless tv with the internet apps, has become a nightmare.I bought a VIZIO router to go with my new Vizio Internet apps tv, so I will see."
2,Share Port doesn't work,"I bought this router for one reason only, be able to print without connecting the printer to my computer. Unfortunately, share port is VERY buggy. Before buying this product make sure to google about Share Port."
4,"This router works, but it's not a magic bullet.","I needed a router with gigabit wired ethernet and figured that wireless would be a good idea as well.It's easy to set-up. It also has a nice ""guest"" password so that visitors who bring their laptops and want access to your wireless internet connection do not get access to your whole network.The 802.11N seems a bit better than my 802.11G was, but I still have issues with wireless coverage. The antennas are detachable, so I may be able to put on some directional antennas to increase my range.I'm not unhappy with my purchase, but it didn't exceed my expectations either.No surprises, so I guess that's a good thing."
5,"Setup Easy, Features Plenty","The setup wizard provided on CD was fool-proof and worked without a hitch, for both my wired and wireless connections. Even myArchos 605 Portable Media Playerconnected over the secure WI-FI. :-) With the many settings and the ability to connect an external USB hard-drive, this is a lot of router for the money."
4,good Router,"This is a good router,with tons of options in the software if you are inclined to messing with your settings.Ive done minimal changes and this router worker great.I do a lot of online gaming with Warhammer and this router takes the load with no disconnects or slowdowns.I had a better linksys router before this and was always getting diconnected while gaming ,,,not with this D Link though,It also connects much faster with my laptop upon turning it on.I did discover that signal strength is affected by the 3 antenna positions,i tried with the router sitting flat and got a 55% signal strength with my PS3,but upon standing the unit up and the antennas positioned as shown in the manual the signals strength went up to 85%.I only gave it 4 stars because I thought the range would be much farther,,I have a 2 story house and the router is in the basement and it does reach the whole house,but i thought it would reach to my garage about a 100 yards away.All in All very satisfied"
2,Works Great with a 4 Wireless Mac's. NO on PC's,"The macs work great. The PC's I cant not log on at all. Tech support suggested all my pcs need network adapter updates. Tech support picked up the phone fast, but did not solve my problem. I can not get on with a PC 3 different models. But I can get on to my neighbors unprotected Netgear wireless router. I guess I'll be at Best Buy in the morning returning this box. Tried everything the told me it's all my PC's."
5,no drops!,"with two laptops, a network printer, and a networked external hard drive, we needed a router upgrade. This wasnt as simple to set up as it claimed, but once it got going, its been great. NO DROPS!!"
3,"Great features, fast connections but unstable firmware.","This feature has a solid build, *fast* connection but it is not very stable. Mine with firmware 1.05, restarts at least once a day, drops and reconnects the DSL connection multiple times a day. Hopefully later versions of the firmware will make it more stable."
5,major improvement,"significant improvement to range, user interface, and tech support... yes tech support.ROUTERthe range of this rounter is considerably greater than my old DIW-524. the user interface is laid out very logically and thus is very easy to navigate.TECH SUPPORTD-link's tech support was very knowledgable, patient, and helpful. wish i could say the same for CenturyTel's DSL Tech Support."
2,UPDATE - Died within 15 months,4/25/11 - The router died on me this week. I won't keep a connection going longer than 24 hours. At first I thought it was Comcast but after plugging my PC directly into my modem I'm running fine. It was a great router but I cannot recommend it due to the short life it has.....This is a great higher end router for the money. My cable provider goes down occasionally and my old router(s) didn't recover very well and needed a reboot twice a month. this router hasn't had any problems and has been online without a reboot for 4 months now. The security features are easy to set up and i have a guest zone for my friends' iphones when they come over.the only downside is that the range is less than my old G router. but i live in a small urban house so the shorter range doesn't cause me any problems.
2,"It works, but...","I recently purchased a D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router and several D-Link DWA-130 Wireless N USB Adapters together. The DIR-655 installed without a hitch and works well with several Linksys wireless G adapters I have. It also works with the DWA-130s but not nearly as well as I had expected. The biggest disappointment is that although the DWA-130s reports that they are attached to the router at 130 MBPS, the effective transfer speed to the network-attached storage box that's plugged into an Ethernet port on the DIR-655 is somewhat slower than it was using the 56 MBPS wireless-G router and adapter that this setup replaces."
5,THE BEST ROUTER. SO CHEAP. SO FEATURE PACKED!,this is used in a house with 5 macs and 1 pc.supports gigabit ethernet which is a MUST feature.use this also with xbox and A READYNAS DUO DEVICE.our internet is Verizon FiOS...this router is the best router i have ever owned. looks really good and works super well.soooooooooo many features you can use but i don't know how to use them... UPnP is such a great feature.. works nice with readynas and xbox 360.wireless connect is very strong.been using it for about a year now and not a single problem. the company frequently releases firmware updates for the device so i highly recommend you check the manufacturers website occasionally to check for firmware updates.best router. EVEN CHEAPER NOW.edit:for some reason... everytime i do a firmware update. i lose all my settings... i know you can save your settings on a file and load it up again... but THAT HAS NEVER WORKED FOR ME! it's annoying that you have to tweak all your settings again after firmware updates.
3,overrated,"distance for the router is not as published, the public needs routers with the distance that export routers have, we need stronger transmission and pickup areas for these routers, sure looks like it would work with all the antennas, my home is frame home with hardi siding, will not penetrate the walls to outside, junk."
2,NOT WHAT ITS CRACKED UP TO BE,Horrible Barely worked at all and range? what range? wish I never bought it.
1,Just awful,D Link has the worst customer support you will ever experience. The product does not get along with my WLAN provider and very frustrating experience even trying to get my computer back up and running after it crashed it.
3,Need a lot of Techinical support,I constantly called D-Link to solve my problems. Tech support was easy to get to and the helped me get my computers connected to the internet. Using the share link software with my windows 7 crashed my computer. I plug in my printer into it's USB port on the back of the unit and needed to install the software for it to work. My printer would only print part of the page. Called tech support and they had me change some settings and my computer crashed for the first time ever. I tried unistalling the software and it will not. I gave up and hooked the printer back to my computer and it works fine there.
1,"No gain over older ""g"" router.","Bought this N router to replace an older D-Link G router to improve coverage/speed (as advertised) so I could reliably watch streaming video from Netflix. Coverage/speed was no better, actually worse than the old G router. Returned for refund. Thank you Amazon for hassle free return policy. No thanks D-Link for misleading advertising, at least in my situation."
4,very pleased with this router,"No complaints after one month use. During set up my virus protectioon, McAfee, would not allow the product software to be viewed as it said it posed a threat. I did not need it however, as my Samsung Blu-ray DVD receiver led me through the set up process without a hitch. I've been streaming Netflix flawlessly."
2,Heating issue,Works like advertised. Worked for a few months then I noticed it kept dropping the signal and internet use. I noticed that it over heats then stops working. I pointed a fan to it and it seems to work. The worst router yet. Security features is the only thing I like from it.
3,Difficult to work....,"Got it in the mail and set it up right away. Followed the instructions. Had it working for about 10 minutes, and then it just stopped. 2 days of trying to fix it. Nothing worked. Had others helping me too. Router would not reset for some reason, and I kept getting error messages when I tried to reinstall. Went and bought the exact same router at local store for a bit more money. This one works. Almost. wireless laptop works, and one of my wired computers works. Which is great. But my third computer, which connect at first, stopped all of a sudden. Still trying to fix that...."
1,fast but dropping signals all the time,"Setting up the router was a breeze. I also realized an increased range and a much higher wireless speed compared to my Linksys WRT54GX.What really bugged me was how often I lost my connection, wireless and plugged in with a network cable.I tried to tweak the setting and resetting the router but to no effect.I switched back to my WRT54GX. It is a bit slower but it is totally stable.I am not able to debug my entire neighborhood and see if anything interferes with the DIR-655. It shouldn't have affected the plugged-in connection.I wasted a lot of time debugging and am done with this product."
2,Not an improvement if you don't need the N,"I purchased this router from Costco, hoping to improve the range and signal over my 2 year old Netgear super G, which occasionally needs rebooting. The setup is not as easy as it should be, required some playing around for the network setting. The signal strength is surprisingmuch weaker than my old super G, with frequent dropping of the connections on all 3 HP notebook running on G, as well as my Palm TX. Unless you have the N setup for most of your wifi needs, I don't believe this router is any better than the regular $[...] router. The Network magic is also quite invasive, especially if you download the program for the wireless computers, which supposely can send a report on the internet history via email. The Network magic often locks the computer upon startup. Fortunately Costco has a good return policy."
2,"Sadly, Did not Work","From all I hear, this is a very good product. However, I could not get it to work on my system. I wish I could give it a good report. My attempts to get it to work corrupted my system so badly that I had to reformat my hard drive. Rather than struggle with foreign product support, I just returned it. I am not a computer illiterate, so I am disappointed that it did not work."
1,I got a lemon,"I bought this item based on the many positive reviews here on Amazon. My only concern with this item is that there is a review saying it runs very hot, which is not a problem with the one I got. It is cool when running.My problem is that the unit I got only worked well for a day or two. Then for no reason my internet connection is intermittent. I was able to isolate the cause to this router since if I connect the modem to my computer, there is no connection problem at all.I called DLink customer service, after an hour of changing settings without being able to make the unit work, they told me to return the unit to Amazon. What a disappointment and waste of time and money! This model might as well be really good. But I certainly got a lemon!"
3,Ok,"Works as advertised, WiFi reception is very good, my net book gets a solid connection from ranges my 2 year old router, wouldn't even be visible from. Had some slight issues with port forwarding, does not seem to handle a lot of customs settings very well."
4,D- Link 655 Extreme N Wireless Router Review,"After having our three year old G router system start to work erratically my wife and I thought it was time to switch over to a more reliable system. After looking through the reviews we chose the D Link 655 and are pleased with our decision. First off it has not dropped any logged-in sessions as was the case with the Linksys g model. It is quicker( not by the advertised amount) adding at least 25% more download speed and the reception on my computer buried many rooms away from the router has improved from ""very low"" to ""good"". I expected ""very good"" reception based on the literature but can't really complain knowing what I had before.The router setup is a breeze and the security feature is outstanding. No problems whatsoever. So far it is living up to its billing."
4,D-link 655,Good wireless router - setup was a easy and the wireless seems to work ok. It could use more range though
2,Does not stay connected,I have tried everything to get this router to stop disconnecting from the internet. It disconnects sometimes every five minutes! Returning!
1,"Stopped working after a week, just like the other 400 negative reviews","Not only is this rather irritating (but manageable) to configure, it straight up stopped working after a week. If you parse the reviews you'll notice that 400 out of 1100 reviewers have given this product 1 star, so I assume they have the same issue. Pretty crappy to think that almost FORTY PERCENT of users have a defective product. Unbelievable. Unfortunately the VOIP company (8x8) that my company uses says this D-Link is the one that works best with their phones, so I have to buy another one. Therefore I'm getting it at Fry's where I can return it ad naseum. If you have to have this modem, I would buy it from somewhere where returns are easy."
5,Great Router,"This Router was recommended to me by my computer guy and it is installed we have it on a network, the price was right and was shipped quickly to Hawaii."
4,Liked,"D-Link DIR-655Product works great, haven't had to reset since installation. Increased download speed and multi use capability and including streaming"
4,Dlink DIR 655,"Exellent router , very stable and a lot of options to play with. Wireless better then 802g but most of the time the router will not use 802n for various resons mainly compatibility with other network adapters.in any ase a very good product I would recommend to others although maybe it better to wait a price drop to 70-85$"
1,Caution - Don't Buy,"After many weeks of struggling with this router, I am now trying to return it to Amazon, even though I am past the return date. The first problem is that the connection (both wired and wireless) drops out for a few minutes on a regular basis. This is particularly painful while watching a movie or playing a game on line. The second problem is that our wireless printer doesn't work well with this router having an intermittent connection. The DLink tech service is a huge pain being well trained in the run-a-round. After countless hours, I finally discovered that this version (B) has a known hardware problem that has not been fixed. I'm told the older version (A) is ok, but I'm not willing to chance it. I'll try to return and have gone back to my old Linksys."
3,"Don't upgrade to firmware 1.3x, it's a nightmare!!!!","I had been very satisfied with my DIR 655 for 1 year, until I upgraded the firmware to 1.32NA, when was the nightmare begins. The router freezes/reboots every 5~10 hours when connected to my cable modem. And takes 10~20 minutes to get connections back. I don't like the firmware 1.32NA at all. I want to downgrade to 1.21 which has been stable for one year. Obviously there is no way for me to downgrade.I believe the securityspot service (non-free service, try to monitor every connections) from the 1.3x firmware hijacked/ruined the best router. (Search the web for complains, someone should be fired if I am the boss).I gave 3-star to D-LINK for their horrible way to abuse firmware upgrading."
4,Beware of Magic,"I had G router and 2 adapters from D-Link which were fine, but wanted to have more speed and better security. So I bought this and two N adapters to create a new network. The installation disks come with software from Network Magic which I decided to install to make the setup simpler. But the computers with the adapters just would not stay connected to the internet and repeatedly had to have their connections repaired, rendering them virtually worthless. Finally, my wife uninstalled Network Magic and went with the Microsoft utility instead. Now everything works great."
2,Intel Mac users beware!,"Intel Macs running the current version of Mac OS X (10.4.9) are incompatible with this router. The configuration page does not render properly on any of my three Macs, regardless of whether they use a wired or wireless connection. And with the latest AirPort firmware on the MacBook, the WPA settings cause a system crash (kernel panic).D-Link technical support was no help. I sent them an email with a screen shot from Safari and Firefox, and they responded: ""You shoudl [sic] be able to do it with safari. Can you try it in another environment?"" So they didn't properly answer my question, and they never responded to my two follow-up emails. Zero stars for tech support!The reason I'm giving this product two stars is that it did work properly with my Windows computers. But Intel Mac users should look elsewhere. I did."
1,Does not work after a year.,Terrible quality. Disconnects intermittently after the first few months. Needs rebooting to get the router to work again. It gets progressively worse. Now it is non functional. Do not buy.
1,Worked for a year,"This router worked great for about a year but now the Wifi radio seems to be going out. This manifests as an inability to connect to the router through Wifi about twice a week. Unplugging it and plugging it back it resolves the issue but who wants to do that every time they use the internet.It was expensive. For this price it should last more than a year.Also, its not compatible with DD-WRT."
4,GREAT PRODUCT,"Wired setup was easy using the installation guide. Wireless was a bit more difficuly. My laptop (XP) was setup without much difficulty. My wife and son's netbooks (both XP) seemed to get stuck on ""verifying identity"" on the initial setup and again when reconnecting. I removed the security key due to this frustration and made the network ""invisible"" so my neighbors would have a more difficult time sharing with me.Changing setups is very easy and speed is excellent for our uses (internet surfing). I do not have N cards on any of my computers, but I doubt it would make a great difference for our uses. We are getting 31 Mbps (wired) and 15 Mbps (wireless) down and about 2 Mbps up. My laptop is located at the other end of the house (about 40 feet and several walls) and have excellent reception.Very happy after about 10 days of ownership."
4,DLink Router,I ordered this router for myself but ended up buying another. My brother n law needed one on his Hughes Satelite powered system so thats where it ended up. Install was ok it wouldnt talk to the modem but Tech Support was lighting fast in answering and telling us what to do. After that we were hooked up and running. Seems to work great but time will always tell.
2,Worst Wi-Fi I have ever owned!,I have to reset it every few days. It was extremely difficult to set up (and I consider myself a pretty advanced computer user ... I work with computers for a living). I will never buy this brand again.
1,Broke,"Had mine for 6 months. It is already broke and the connection is slow. One of the white antenna's is flopping around, it will not screw on tightly again. Oh well. I guess I will have to buy the apple product."
4,Took time to setup - But after that works spotlessly,"As soon as I connected the router to the newly setup modem, it wouldn't show a connection to the net. I then cloned the MAC address from my previous wireless router and restarted the modem. Not sure if this was the right way to set it up, but it worked. [I didn't use the included CD or setup wizard] Haven't lost wireless connection even once after purchase [2 months]. I have 3 wired connections (gaming laptop, work laptop and Xbox) and another 4 laptops connected by wireless for at least 6 hours a day as well as 3 android phones [WIFI] and 2 iPod touch devices connected intermittently throughout the night on weekdays and most of the time during the weekends. Connection timeout set at 7 days but have never experienced it. This is heaven compared to my 4 year old Belkin which would require manual restarts for the dropped connections to reconnect."
4,router review,easy to set up and speed did increase as if connected to the modem directly. slows down when more than one person on for gaming.
1,Unreliable junk,"I have this router for a few months and its wireless performance is terrible. File transfer speeds are about 5 times lower then on my previous SMC router. In addition - wireless connectivity break daily for no apparent reason, and since wired connections keep working at the same time I cannot blame my provider."
3,Beware of the Wizard,"I writing to let you know that the other positive reviews are correct, but they need to warn you off the use of the ""Wizard"" CD enclosed in the package. I've setup several DIR-655's. The first time I followed the instructions and used the ""Wizard"". It caused so much grief that I had to delete it out of my system. When I didn't use the ""Wizard"" setup was a snap. But know that the Netgear N900 has more range when on the low band."
2,Have worse signal strength than a Verizon router..,"I bought this router to replace my own Verizon wireless-g router.I searched the reviews and found out it would be fit to my 3 story house.However the truth is it has worse signal strength than my Verizon router!I tried searching for the solution online, updated the firmware to the latest version, using the WPA2 AES encryption, trying different mode (b+g+n, g+n, g only, n only...)but the signal strength is still weaker than my Verizon router in any places of my house. (I compared them by putting them side by side)It is quite disappointed since I was expected a much stronger signal with the wireless-n by its 14x faster speeds and 6x farther range description.I am returning it and simply keep my old router."
2,May work well for a while,"I purchased one 3 years ago. Just after 1 year of use (and the 1 year warranty period) the router totally died. I ordered a new one which worked well for almost 2 years, at which point the wireless LAN would intermittently go out. When I tried to update to the latest firmware (over a wired connection) the router malfunctioned and no longer works due to a failed FW load. Don't expect this router to last more than a year or so."
3,Dead after 2.5 years,"My 655 lasted ~ 2.5 years before starting to overheat (at which point I'd have to manually reset it to get the connection back). I had a Netgear do this before and at least on that one, I was able to write a script to monitor it, and do the reset automatically, I but I was never able to get my script to get past the DLink admin login.For the most part the 655 did its job. I am puzzled to see it gets some of the best reviews around.. ie. that's more of a statement that the firmware on so many other products is lacking.The worst part of the 655 is the Dlink support forums. I mean support forums are usually for folks having trouble.. but the admins there readily remove the worst complaints and/or if you make any reference that products other than Dlink.For me, I did a side-grade to a single-band Asus. Got my setup xfer'd over from the 655 in ~10 minutes. Slightly better signal too."
5,all I want,"Enabled me to multiple surf, play online games on my wireless laptop without any noticeable lag.I was able to take advantage of redirecting web requests to my desktop so I can use my computer as a web server.I printed the manual on the CD. I haven't explored all the features yet but it seems so far that I got what I wanted."
4,very good router,I have been using this Router for last month or so. and below are my observations.I connected total 5 devices and all are working like charm wihout any connection issues.Far betten than my old router.pros:1) easy to setup2) very good wifi range and speed.3) reasonable price.4) network usb sharable drive.
3,horrible interface,pro: has a very stable connection. long range.cons: the GUI is not user friendly. hard to set upbaseline: solid reliable device.
1,"It is a ""Junk""","Do not waste your time. It does not work. I spent at least a week, changing all sorts of settings. It did not work. I returned it."
3,To much for a nerd,Bought this d-link on the advice of a friend. He thought I was an electronic whiz. I've never got it to work with a DSL modem. The DVD and the manual setup tells me it's right it still wont work. I'll get old computer brain to hook it up for me.
1,DIR-655,Worked as promised to replace a slightly older (but still working) D-Link router. The only issue I had setting it up was in the config wireless menu. It kept loging me off everytime I tried to change a wireless channel (the higher ones). Was finally able to get the config to work. My daughter has had some wireless issues with lack of internet connectivity but haven't figured out if it's the router or her laptop (she ends up rebooting the laptop and fixing it before I can look at it). D-Link support was great to help fix an initial set-up problem of no DSL connectivity.Update: Had to remove this piece of junk. The intermittment dropping of internet connections about once a day was too much. Replaced this with my old D-Link router (DIR-815). Haven't had one minute of trouble since.
2,When it works it is great,"Okay, I am not writing this as a brand new owner. I have had this router for almost a year. It works well and is fast. The largest problem/issue I have is that it will randomly just drop the connection. It stops broadcasting the signal. I verified it wasn't the ISP by having another devices connected to it that should be able to communicate if it was an ISP problem. So, long story short. If you want inexpensive and works pretty good then buy. If you game with it or do any form of internet based work, shy away since you could be in the middle of something and lose all of your work since your last save or if gaming, you will just die and leave your teammates going nuts."
1,Terrible Product,"This product is unreliable and it is incompatible with other D-Link products. I had high hopes for it, but found it would restart constantly when there was any significant traffic going through it. Moreover, when I tried to run it in ""Pre-N"" mode with an AppleTV, I was unable to get it to connect at anything higher than 54Mbps and would not work at all with another D-Link product (Wireless Game adapter) that only supported ""G"" mode. I was also very concerned about the longevity of the product because it runs very hot.I spent numerous hours on hold with D-Link tech support and ultimately switched back to my old, reliable Linksys WRT-54G and added a Gig-E switch to connect my fastest wired devices. Unfortunately I went past 30 days trying to get the DIR-655 to work reliably and the return period expired."
3,Range is poor,"I am somewhat knowledgeable about networking. I have networked my home computers several times. I am knowledgeable about computer programming.I bought this router for increased speed and hopefully range. The speed increased but the range did not. The range is still mediocre at 20 feet.I found the user interfaces on Netgear products to be superior as they provide additional advance settings.In the past, I found that using USB corded ""network cards"" are better than network cards that stick out the back of the computer since you can place the corded USB adapters in varios positions (away from the computer) to increase range.I would not recommend this product if you require an increase in range."
1,The worst router,This router takes a rocket scientist to install. I tried for one hour and this just cannot be connected. I had the same problems with my old D-Link router too. The worst router ever!~
1,"Awful, never works correctly",ALWAYS drops connections. I am on here right now because it just did a second ago. Every time it does (1x per day!) I have to manually unplug it. DO not but this.
2,jim,"Im sure this d-link router would have been fine if you could get it hooked up.I,for the life of me had no luck with it.Startup disk,Tech Support,I tried it all.There tech support is a joke,and they did not have the time of day for me,much less understand there eastern indian accent.I sent it back for a refund.I'll stick with NetGear."
5,Great Product!!!,"Just replaced a Cisco with this unit and the difference is incredible! The Cisco would constantly cycle off and need to be rebooted at least five times a day. The D-link DIR-655 has been flawless since day one! I was hoping for a little more range though. The unit is on a different floor of the house than where I use my laptop and the distance is about 30 feet. In hindsight, the standard ""g"" model would have probably done just a good since my main reason for getting the ""n"" was for range. Remember that even the fastest ISP can only hit ~50Mps, so the ""n"" only helps if transfering files between computers on the network and not improve your ""surfing"" or ""online streaming"" speed."
1,Does not work wirelessly with all devices,"I bought this and it will not work wirelessly when password protected with my: PS3, I-Pod Touch, 4 yearD-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Routerold Toshiba laptop...all these devices worked with the previous router that I had. The mfgr tried to help on the phone (by reading from a script) for about 30 minutes then referred me to a website. The website just had FAQs so I am stuck with a router that only works with 40% of my devices."
4,Easy Set Up,I just received the D-link today so I gave it 4 stars. I will update after I have had it for awhile. The set up was easy and it took me 15 minutes to be up and running (my computer and my other wireless devices. I have excellent range and does not take up alot of space.
5,"Simple, does the job","After reading these reviews, I bought this router. I set it up using the CD in about 20 minutes. Had 3 laptops working well in 1/2 hour, any delays were with firewalls. It has worked well across the house nearly 50 feet away, and in the basement. So far no dropped signal after about a week of use."
4,D-Link router,"It works fine. I have had to reboot it and disconnect it a few times, but after a few weeks I think it's been worth the money (not cheap)."
5,D-Link DIR-655 Router,"So far so good. It seems to run faster and not ""drop"" the computer as often as the old one (Linksys)"
3,Good but not great.,"First off I'd buy this model again, so my criticisms may sound harsher than I mean. The setup was easy, the connection to both the wired and wireless PCs are consistently good. The flaw in the system is the networked USB device ""Shareport"" technology. It is horrible. There are several steps to get each PC configured with the Shareport Utility. But after it's installed it randomly works. One PC connects, the other doesn't always even see the printer connected or can't disconnect from it. Sometimes powering off the Dlink DIR-655 corrects the problem, sometimes not. I've had to pull the printer off the Dlink to get any kind of printer usage. I hope Dlink gets there act together with the Shareport feature as that is a great plus."
4,D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router,It works. I'm happy with it. I have not explored all the options.Software setup was a bit of an issue if you are upgrading from one router to another.There is a step in the setup where it will continuously hang up..ignore it.The router will work regardless..I realized this after about an hour of setup time when it should have taken 15 minutes. Your exprience maybe different.
4,Complicated hookup; professional help has problems,"It works as advertised, but instructions and phone help were inadequate. They don't tell you in the printed instructions that they do not recommend use of Microsoft Connect any longer; D-Link now uses another company software (good software) for the installing the device. The on-line help didn't know about certain instructions When D-Link person on phone help was questioned about changes spelled out in the inclosed instructions, he was unaware of them. If I hadn't had a ""professional"" installing this, it still most likely wouldn't be connected. The D-Link ""help"" was very courteous I would like to add.If you really know what your doing and can ""translate"" the instuctions and, if needed, get help from a D-Link person who knows all the latest instructions etc, then the product is a good deal."
2,no better than a cheaper model,D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless RouterI bought this router to replace a cheaper Linksys router. Unfortunately it didn't increase the signal strength and it kept fading in and out. I went back to my Linksys and returned this router.
3,Router works well. USB over Ethernet does not.,"I bought this ""premium"" router both its N-ness and the USB-over-ethernet capability. The router works well. Features are easy to setup via its browser user interface. I am satisfied with the speed. However, I am not happy with the network USB. Its performance is terrible. On a gigabit wired network I get a speed of only 3 MB/s when using a 500 GB USB external hard drive on the network USB. On the other hand, the same hard drive plugged directly into the PC gives a throughput of 30 MB/s.Overall, the router is expensive for what it provides if you consider the network USB feature as useless because of its pitiful speed. Back to the drawing board D-Link."
2,Apple Users Left Behind,"The USB feature is NOT supported for apple computers... everything else is OK, but 1 missing feature is a huge bummer"
3,Too much effort...,I bought this product to replace a linksys router because I was trying to get better coverage in my house. Dlink claimed wider and faster coverage but I discovered the coverage at best was only as good as my older and cheaper linksys router. I ended up keeping the linksys and purchasing a 100feet of cat5 cable and hardwiring the two routers and placing them in different places in the house. Once I had done this I found the Dell wireless card could not pick up the secured dlink router and had to go out an purchase a new dlink wireless card for the desktop...I had my ISP provider try and get the connectivity and this was our only solution to get the coverage...not really as straighforward and simple as advertised...
2,Not for the non techie,"I bought this router to replace my Belkin-G router. Just wanted something faster. The reviews were great all over the net. The features sound fantastic but none of that matters if you can't get the darn thing to work. I am not a techie. I want to plug and go. I can follow the installation instructions given by most install wizards. If I have to go to the manual to install, that's a red flag for me. I could not get this router to recognize my SBC dsl connection for anything. My belkin ( and previously netgear) routers recognize my SBC internet just fine. No fuss or muss. I am sure with tweaking and futzing this thing would have worked. Tech support wanted me to turn off firewall, check DNS IP and download updates. Way too much involvement for me. I'll go look for a netgear or belkin N-router."
5,D-Link,The D-Link is working fine for us. We have four computers hooked into it and my son-in-law does mostly gaming on his pc. I'm satisfied with it.
2,Good if you don't touch it,"When applying changes to the port forwarding and other types of settings like that, it forces you to go through a 30 second reboot. Quite annoying when working with it.The latest firmware I applied failed, and bricked my router. Dlink support told me to go buy a new one since I was out of warranty. I could understand if it just died one day, but it was the firware's fault that it bricked, and I get stuck with the bill.When it did work, it was great. Good performance, good wireless signals etc.I will be buying an Asus instead for the replacement."
1,Router not working,"It Keeps dropping internet connections..Cannot use router when connected to computer, because computer cannot connect to the internet. Called cutomer assistance in Oct.,(2 weeks after I bought it) and in Dec. Router tested faulty... Amazon's warrenty has just expired... so now waiting for D-link to send a replacement... Really a bummer not having a router when you need one..."
1,Well...,"It worked great for a year or so, but when I done the required firmware upgrade, all I was left with was a white paperweight."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this router exited that I would receive a top of the line router for only 70 dollars. The set up was easy, and it has flying fast speeds. But now a week later after, replacing all wires, unplugging both the modem and router, resetting and reinstalling, my connection is still being lost and websites are still refusing to load. The wireless strength is incredible, but lacks connection. There are 3 wireless devices in my 2/2, and one 360 hard wired to the router, all of which cannot hold a connection.Needless to say I am disappointed and will be replacing this router."
2,18-24 Months then Kaput!,Router worked wonderfully for the warranty period then started randomly dropping Wireless Support. Not worth the money...will stick with a Netgear or Linksys next time.
5,Great home router,This router is a very well priced robust router. It runs very well and rarely locks up like my old router. I highly suggest this router. If you own an iPad i would suggest setting a reserved IP so the iPad connects immediately to that IP
4,"No huge jump in speed, but an improvement in range.","Not the easiest router to set up. I tried the manual set up on a Mac, no dice. I used a laptop with a wired connection got the router working after about 4 tries. Once I disconnected the laptop to go wirelessly, the laptop had a hard time connecting, but success was achieved without calling tech support."
5,Awesome!,It is everything I expected and more. I did my research on which router to buy and I'm glad to say that it has paid off!!
5,No problems here,"I recently purchased the DIR-655 to replace a dying router. Installation was easy. I did not use any of the supplied CD's. Everything set up easily with the network interface and all of my computers connected without issue in g and n. . . macs, pc's, my computers, other people's computers. The file transfer speeds are nice for the N machines and it seems I have more range with this router than the standard G router I had before.Gaming has improved as well while others are using the internet. I normally would not buy a higher end router such as this, but I received an Amazon coupon from work for Christmas. I am happy with the purchase and hope this unit lasts a long time."
2,Piece of Garbage!!!,"After researching and reading all kinds of reviews, I plunged in to buy this router since the 3 laptops in the home are all N-type. My previous router was Linksys (a true gem for over 7 years) G type.It's been over 6 weeks since I am using the Dlink DIR-655 router. As of this week, this router constantly disconnects both the wired and wireless connections. Happens every 30-40 mins and I am dead in the water for about a 1 min every time. It automatically disconnects and then connects back. This problem started only this week. I have the latest firmware and I have not changed anything else in the set up on either this router or my cable modem. This is very annoying. I have rebooted the router and the modem couple of times and still the problem exists. Why after 6 weeks of use--I don't know. My previous G-type Linksys router had no issues for many years. I am ready to just throw this router out and go back to Linksys. I am definitely staying away from Dlink products."
1,Ended up in the trash after 7 mos,"I admit it worked great when it worked. I have 4 Netflix devices and it handled them all well. However it was unstable and constantly required resetting (the wired connection) not the wireless. My previous US Robotics device worked flawlessly for years.Phoning D-Links customer support in India resulted in 2 blatant and direct lies. The reason for phoning was the power supply had a short that rebooted the the router on any slight movement. It was clearly under warranty as I was looking at the warranty while speaking to the agent YET he insisted the power supply was out of warranty. When I insisted it was under warranty he changed direction and tried to tell me it would cost more to return than to purchase new.After I insisted on speaking to a SUPER I finally got an RMA for the cost of postage BUT to be honest-even if they sent a new product, why would I risk the loss of my future effort on a substandard company/product. Look elsewhere folks."
3,It is ok,"The router came in the time requested. Upon opening the package the CD rom was warped and did not work in the drive. Fortunately the instructions had the website address to access the needed informaiton. The router is satisfactory, but provides me no more coverage than the netgear WGR614v7 it replaced. The only reason for purchasing this model was the expected increase in range.As far as reliability it sometimes has to be rebooted."
1,dir-655 lasted 22 days,"Worked great for 22 days, then i wasn't able to connect wirelessly. Tried resetting the unit with no luck. Called support and after 45 minutes on the phone, I was told the until was defective and I needed to send it back for a refund."
5,Works great!,"I went back to a cable modem so I needed it wifi. I do know something about setting everything up and it was a breeze! Reception is great! Can even pick up a good signal in my parking lot! Very pleased.Only negative is that I occasionally have to put in my WAP code again on my Mac, but other than that not a problem! (Have the same issue with the wifi at work. Could be a Mac thing.)"
3,Worked well for 3 weeks,"Worked very well for 3 weeks, then all the lights went out and there was a burning smell. I noticed that the plastic case started melting on top! After spending 45 minutes on the phone with tech support (India, I presume), they finally arranged to ship me a new one. I'd rather have had another model, who knows if this one won't burn as well."
1,Buy a different router. I don't care how good of deal this seems like,"I have owned several routers for home and work. I have setup countless routers for friends and family. After I could not get this router to hold an internet connection, I called DLink tech support. I spent two hours on the phone with them only for them to say, ""It sounds like its a hardware problem and I should get a replacement unit."" I asked how often this happens and she said, ""Quite often."" Yikes. Just spend the extra couple bucks and get a Linksys/Cisco."
2,Not as good as the its reviews state.,"Worked ok the first day. However, the router and printer only works together part-time at best. Not as reliable as I had hoped. At this moment, I cannot recommend this product. Customer service is ok at best. Just make sure you don't mind waiting about 20 before someone picks up your line."
3,"Great, but if you're on COMCAST.. READ This","Great little router.The latest firmware ships with 'Advanced DNS' as 'enabled', by default.D-Link confirmed with me that this feature has a conflict with Comcast.The 'effect' of that is a good deal of instability and problems.Took me 2 days, and finally a call to D-link support to get back online.With much troubleshooting we identified that 'disabling' the 'Advanced DNS' feature makes all thos problems go away.Still, a great router. Much better with stability."
2,Don't waste your Money!,This router lasted about a year then it started dropping wireless signals. It also had to be rebooted all the time. It was very aggravating having to reboot the router all the time and had to be in the same room for the wireless to work. I replaced it with a Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL Router that is working without a hitch!
2,Router DIR 655,After used 3month the router get lost signal when I connected 2 laptops in wifi. I don't have time to call customer service until I did call customers service and show they problem and they said the warranty only 90 days. If I want the warranty in 2 year I have to paid $99. So I decided to buy another one but not Dlink anymore.
4,papajoe,"Dlink works great so far. Was easy to install, and get connected. I also like the look of the unit. The range is pretty good, but not as good as I was hoping, but this could also be because of the structure of the house and the location of the unit. All in all, I'm pleased."
1,Do NOt Buy this product -- Hopeless to add repeater,"This family of products is hopeless. I bought the dir 655 and its sister repeater hoping I could easily string together. The instructions were useless. It was hopelessly complex to set up and the online help guides are woeful. When I called teh manufacturer they told me I needed to wire products together in a way that was never shown in any part of the manual. When I followed their instructions the router was disabled and despite resetting twice, I could never get it working again. I lost 8 hours of my life I will never get back.These guys are terrible and I cannot rate poorly enough."
1,Very slow and connection drops off,"I have it for more than a year now. Initially it was impressive but now, the download/upload is ~5mbps/2mbps and connection drops off very frequently. This is not a good product. Before this, I had a Linksys wrt54g and it was awesome. I wanted to upgrade and ended up buying this piece of junk."
5,Greatest N Router,"Easy installation and flawless connection. You can't go wrong with this router. The trial software ""Network Magic"" is great for effortlessly bringing it all together. After the trial certain features are not available however your configuration is still valid. All in all I would give this router higher than 5 stars if I could. I did not purchase the D-Link N PCI cards as the reviews on those were not good, but the router is fantastic."
4,"After a little fustration installing, it works fine.","The install wizard didn't work for me (no obvious reason) and technical help was not that helpful, but after playing with the the manual installation it's finally happy with my network. No problem connecting my ""g"" standard wireless laptop, and the connection strength is stronger than ever. More importantly, my network is now buzzing along at 1gigbit speed (don't forget to upgrade all of your network cards as well)."
3,Disappointed,"This is my third D-link router over the past 10-15 years. I have always been very happy with them. I bought the DIR-655 to replace a 5 year old DIR-625 that is starting to get ""glitchy"" and I have to do a soft reset every day.I was wary of the bad reviews, but ""the experts"" at CNET and New Egg said this was a great router, so...Very easy to set up. Basically it is idiot proof.The problem is the range. I went from a strong 5 bars with the old DIR-625 down to a weak 2 bars with this model. The distance is maybe 25 feet to my laptop in the bedroom. It wasn't even recognised at the back of the house...and I have a range extender.I will be returning this and stick with my old router. It is a pain to have to unplug it once or twice a day, but at least it will reach to the very back of the house (60 feet)with a strong signal.I hate to see D-Link lose their good reputation."
1,Not long-term reliable,"Have had this router for only a few months. Wireless radio needs daily resetting. It just stops working after about 24 hours. Now the ethernet connection drops for no apparent reason. Last time it happened, I connected the modem directly to my computer to make sure there was no problem with the ISP, and the signal was blazing fast. Rehooked the router, no connection. Rest the router, no connection. Reinstalled the router from scratch. No connection. Then after an hours it started working again. Then after while it stopped.You get the picture. So I am shopping for a new router. My advice for this one? Avoid!"
2,"The first one was defective, the second was horrible","I bought this a few months ago. the first one did not work. It had to be returned, at my expense. The turnaround time for replacement was ok. The main complaint I have is that it refuses to connect to any of the Macs I own. I have tried 2 different Macbook Pros. They will not connect. It connects with an XP PC a Windows 7 PC and XBOX 360, although the connection is erratic at times. I have called tech support at DLink and Apple and each says it is the others fault. The Ironic part is that I have used bootcamp on my old 2008 Macbook Pro and am able to connect. Yet, not with OSX on the same damned machine. .It even connects to my iPhone. I am lost. In the end. I have had no issues with my Airport Extreme with any devices."
2,Keeps Dropping the Wi-Fi Signal,"I bought this router in December because of the reviews on here. After 30 days (past the return policy of the store I bought it at), the router kept dropping my Wi-Fi signal. I called D-Link on 5 different occasions to try and fix it and they had me configure the router as many times, but nothing worked. The router still kept dropping the signal. Then I thought it was the modem from my internet provider, so I switched out the modem for a new one with my ISP to see if that would fix it...Failed.I took the router back to the store I bought it at, and they only gave me a replacement of the same one...So I'm on my SECOND D-Link DIR-655 and it's still dropping the signal...So now every time it drops the signal (which is almost every time I get on my computer), I have to restart the whole system from the computer to the router...It sucks.DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER! The customer service from D-Link is no help..."
2,Just FYI: This router doesnt like bittorrent,"So after trying a few other routers, I saw that this router was rated really high for gaming. So I figured what the heck. Well little did I know, it may be good for games but has serious issues with bittorrent traffic.The thing will bog down any network if a bittorrent client is running, and there really isnt any way to get around it. It's just how its made.I am returning and ordering the Acer Black Diamond instead. It is built for both."
1,Lasted ONLY 3 months,"Bought in March, Wireless is now cutting in and out. Direct connections work fine--but come on--90 days before the wireless goes. I haven't tried customer support--not sure it's worth it, last time I had a similar issue took forever for them to tell me to reset the router, update the firmware--and still had the same issues. No more D-LInk for me--I'll be buying NetGear."
4,Great Router,"Router has increased speed and range over my old Linksys Wireless G router. The setup script didn't work, but I called D-Link and they walked me through the manual setup. I'm very happy with this router."
5,Cool!,"It's really cool router. Using with MacBook Air and iPhone 4 with wi-fi N. Everything is speedy!No any lags, easist set up.Highly recommended!"
5,Easy Set-Up - Great Speeds,"After having a lot of problems with the Motorola 6580 modem + router combo, I ended up getting this + Motorola 6120. Set-up was extremely easy. Followed the install via the disk and was up and running in no time. My wireless speeds are on average 15 Mbps and often getting into 25 - 30 range.I only had one problem with this item. My company installed upgraded security software and after that I found I was having problems in connectivity for my work computer. Took awhile to figure it out, but after some research, the problem stemmed from compatibility issues with the firewall. There's a couple ways to get around this; DMZ, port forwarding, virtual server and just turning off the firewall.I run HULU and Netflix on my PS3 with HD and I have no buffering stalls even though I have two personal computers going and two Androids connected.The interface to make changes is very easy - albeit reading the manual helps a great deal."
1,Very bad experience with this product,"I spent at least three hours trying to set up this router in replacement of an older and slower, but still functioning, D-link one. Only one of my three computers on the former network recognized the new router. I called D-link's tech support and was on the phone with them for a good hour. The guy (name available on request) finally said he would phone me back in 10 minutes. He never did. After trying again to set up the router by myself, I phoned back tech support, and talked to somebody (name available on request) who seemed somewhat more knowledgeable -- but this was probably only an illusion. After another 15 minutes on the phone and me climbing back in the ladder again to reach the router, the thing did work briefly. But it stopped shortly after the phone call. I don't know if it happens often with this product, but the item was obviously defective. Worse, the tech support people don't seem to have ""defective"" as an option in their diagnosis!"
2,Bad range.,"I bought this router to replace my older D-Link router to get better range. I use a Samsung TV with Internet@TV and an XBox360 as a media extender in my living room which is ~45 feet away from the router. There is no obstructions or interference. I could not stream HDTV due to too weak of a signal no matter what I tried, so I decided to buy this router.I replaced it and set up the new router with no issues. I went and connected the x-box to the new router and was very disappointed to see that signal was actually worse. I was getting 8-9 bars (out of 15, 11+ needed for HD) with the old router, and now I'm getting 3-4 bars with this one. The antennas on this unit are small and cheap. Less than half of the power of my previous years old standard 1 antenna (but bigger and better) d-link router.I'm going to try another brand which states to have better range.I would not recommend this router if you're looking for good range."
4,Took a minute to figure out...,I previously had a Linksys WRT54 wireless router that was so simple to set up so when I started working on this router I thought it shouldn't be so difficult. How wrong was I!!My only single piece of advice for folks buying this router is this- YOU MUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER OR IT WILL NOT WORK. lol
2,"Does not deliver stated speeds, unreliable","I purchased this item based on the highs review here, but I am disappointed and regret my choice because it does not deliver the stated performance levels reliably.This router is easily overloaded and struggles to deliver the full N speeds across the wireless network. This results in stuttering web video streams, poor file transfers which hang part way through, and a need to restart the unit every few days to restore performance. It's worth reading the dlink support forums to see what others say about this router -- it sounds like many users have the same issues with the dir-655 that I do.I'm switching back to my 6 year old 802.11g router, which had no issues at the same usage level."
5,Easy and fast,"I called the DLink support and had it setup with my Macbook very easily, without downloading any software or having to install anything. It was up and running within minutes. The n wireless is very fast. From the other end of my house (~100 feet) I still got 5/5 bars of signal. An excellent buy!"
4,Simple setup - great performance,"The wireless signal in my house was really disappointing me, so I decided to upgrade my router and step up our game a little.The signal from this router has been outstanding. I don't have any of the problems I used to have. And I haven't had to reset it once. That's great, compared to what I'm used to."
2,I'm sure there are Better Ones Now-I've Had Issues,"When I first purchased this router a few years ago, I loved it. However, I am one of the people who have had issues with it, namely the wireless signal dropping out several times a day.If you search issues with the router, you'll find that it has an issue with dropping wireless. It seems to be related to the firmware version, but the older version which didn't appear to have any issues can no longer be loaded into the router.About 4 times a day, the router will drop the wireless signal. So everyone on will get disconnected for 1 minute to 15 minutes. Very annoying. You can unplug it and power it back up and it will come on, but none the less, annoying.I plan on replacing it as soon as I can find the time to reconfigure whatever new one I purchase, which will take me hours."
4,DIR-655 was a good choice,"The DIR-655 improved my remote wireless connection (about 250 feet) from a weak and unreliabale 1 mbps to a reliable 11 to 18 mbps, not the 54 mbps maximum for my system, but still a great improvement for my circumstances!"
4,Very Configurable Router Complicated to Setup,"I am a techie of sorts, give me any AV system and I can do wonders. I am very familiar with most routers because every new AV product now a days needs network access. I do like this router it is very configurable but it is also very complicated to configure. I have had to spend many hours of fixing issues with connections for this router that my old Airport extreme just did. This is not a bad thing, but the buyer needs to know this will not be a quick install. I have two Mac laptops and one PC, a home automation system (Crestron) and a Wii. I have had issues getting every one of these connections. or having slow connects. There are a lot of configurations that need to be taken into consideration.Also this has not improved my reception any. I even bought the DWA-652 for my PC and I have had more issues with this slowing down or freezing my PC."
4,Be aware...NO support for 10Mb devices,"I love every aspect of this router. However, be warned that a Gigabit switch in D-Link's definition DOES NOT imply 10Mb support. It will only do 100Mb and 1000Mb. I just verified this with tech support, who were quite friendly, by the way, and I got through to them immediately. So even if everyone else in the industry sells a router with a 4-port Gigabit switch that is backwards compatible with slower devices, apparently D-Link does not, at least for this model. I'll have to knock them 1 star because even their tech support site incorrectly makes the claim of lower 10Mb support."
2,Great product if you don't use Xbox LIVE,"This is a wonderful router for everything you'd want to do... except if one of those things is play games on Xbox LIVE. You experience constant disconnections during any movie streaming, downloading, or multiplayer sessions. My average play time is about 2 minutes before being disconnected. I'm familiar with configuring a router, isolating an IP, using the DMZ, setting forwarding... and none of it in any combination works. Other net-connected appliances stream just fine, only the Xbox suffers.I have nothing but great things to say about this router aside from that. Easy to set up, a great breadth of security and customization features, good wifi coverage... but it all is for naught when you can't enjoy it fully."
1,On and Off inconsistent,THIS UNIT NEVER WORKED CORRECTLY FROM DAY ONE. CONSTANTLY DROPPING THE SIGNAL WHILE ONLINE OR STREAMING THE BALLGAME. WENT BACK TO MY OLD LINKSYS AND NEVER AGAIN LOST A CONNECTION. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS UNIT TO ANYONE.
1,Terrible,I bought this router as an upgrade from my Netgear wireless g router. As soon as it was installed I started losing connection intermittently and on several occasions couldn't connect at all. My son has an Xbox and he also was having a lot of issues with the online gaming. After four days we switched back to the Netgear router and all the previous issues were gone. This will be my last D-Link purchase.
1,Signal drops almost once a week,This is worst wireless router I have owned. I got it about 2 months ago since than I had to reset it almost once a week because all of sudden signal drops. If you already own this piece of s*** router the problem is signal mode. Try to manually change G&N; or only N mode.emailed D-Link and no response. Don't buy D-Link DIR-655 N+300 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router
2,Frustration,"Be prepared for an aggrevating setup. It does seem to work as advertised, even the shareport. The LAN connection is very fast, I donot have my ""n"" WLAN card yet, so I cannot comment. I had to manually set the security key in Windows to get connected. I guess this maybe a windows issue, but my old zxytel must have done this on its own. Whatever. My blood pressure has returned to normal and the 655 has avoided the hammer, atleast for now."
4,Fast but tedious set-up,"I got this to keep the gigabit speed of my network between two switches (D-Link DGS-2208 8-Port 10/100/1000 Desktop Switch). It works great once you get past the initial set-up. I tried logging in directly to it using the IP it comes with (192.168.0.1) and it would not let me do it. Then I had to run the wizard a few times on a windows machine to get it to let me configure it manually.Other than that, it works great. I wish it had markers on the switch side that lets you know what connections are running at 1000 mbps like their switches do. And it does run a bit warm."
3,Was a great router prior to the firmware update.,"I loved this router till I upgraded the firmware to 1.31. After the upgrade, I have frequently had to cycle the power to get the router to work correctly. If you upgrade the firmware, you can't go back to versions prior to 1.31. The latest version has helped somewhat, but I still have to cycle the power a couple of times a week. If they get this problem fixed, then I will be happy. When working, the router is fast and the range is great. I keep the router in my basement near my server and I can get a strong signal anywhere on my property. (7700 sqft lot with a 1850 sqft ranch house with full basement) I don't have any portable devices that use n yet, but my g devices all get strong signals now."
3,Disappointed with signal strength,"Set-up worked fine with Vista, some issues with XP computer. Phoned tech support to work around issue.Disappointed with signal strength in kitchen. We're talking, basement to main level 50 feet. This is only one wall, maybe fireplace and floor, unless ceramic tile interferes with signal."
4,D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router,"I bought this router based on claims that it was among the best for extended range coverage. My previous router was an inexpensive Linksys G router. It was easy to set up and instructions were clear for getting maximum range performance. My intent was to set this router up in my neighbor's house and share his internet. I was disappointed to find that this router performed no better in range than my Linksys, and that I could get no signal from an installation in the neighbor's house about 200 feet away from my computer. If I took my computer within 60 feet of the neighbor's house I got reasonable signal. It works as advertised when installed in my house where my computers are within 40 feet of the router. So, if you are looking for max range from a N router, this isn't the one.D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router"
1,Installer does not run,I received this router today and it is going right back to Amazon. The install CD does not work. I have read that other people have had the same problem. It does not Autorun and you cannot even open the file by trying to run it manually. I copied the whole CD also and tried to run the exe file that way. It does not run. I looked at the web-site for a downloadable install file and there is not one there. So this was just a huge waste of my time. I'm going back to Linksys. Much more reliable!
2,complicated install,"i was unable to establish a connection after following all the onscreen instructions. i called d-link support and spent an hour with a technician, who talked me through a difficult process. i had internet connection for one day before losing signal. another hour on the phone and two more technicians later, i was able to acquire a connection. my router is located about 40 feet from my customary notebook work area and i have frequently been unable to access internet through the wireless and had to use the desktop. d-link dir 655 ""extreme"" n wireless router is definitely ""extreme""ly difficult."
1,Died After 5 Weeks,"Not sure what happened. I am not a tech guru but I am not a newbie either.Just FYI.I am stuck buying a new router because spending hours on the phone with tech support or taking time to ship there and back and blah blah blah, is not worth the time.I hope mine was a fluke."
4,Nice unit - replaced an old linksys,"I originally bought a Belkin, but ran into tons of problems with poor software and worse support. So I took it back.With this unit Tried using the guided setup, but it failed, so I just did it the old fashioned way. So much for intelligent setups!Once setup it has worked fine. One hint, I have DSL and the default for PPoe on ths is to disconnect after 5 minutes of non-use, just set it to not disconnect."
3,Shareport doesnt work on the latest Mac OS X version,"External antennae aren't any better than comparable internal antennae models.Shareport application is not available as a download for MAC OS X Snow Leopard. I e-mailed customer support about this issue and NEVER heard a response back. I searched the user support forums and found several threads of shareport not available for the latest MAC OS version (10.6), although available for OLDER versions.Since my primary reason of interest in upgrading to this newer router was the shareport feature, the fact that it is not compatible with my MAC prompted me to return the product."
4,great router,easy setup and better reception then my linksys i replaced so far no lost connections either that is why i replaced my linksys router
4,"My first D-link, used to be a Linksys customer","I bought this router to replace a WRT-160N router from linksys that just wasn't working good (by the way I don't recommend by any means linksys, it used to be a good brand, but it is not any more.This Dir-655 has worked ok, I have no major complains and what is really great is the fact that it has external antenas, so range can be boosted easily.The only that just doesn't work is the usb share-port, but anyway it's kind of a plus so..."
1,Horrible...Stay Away,"I purchased the DIR 655 when I received the unit it would not accept an IP address from my DSL modem. I sent it back RMA. The replacement unit accepted an IP from my DSL modem, but would turn off the WiFi every 5 to 20 minutes. The router is absolutely useless for streaming DLNA from my home media server. I don't believe in ""3 strikes your out"" with consumer products. Hit me once shame on you, hit me twice shame on me. I am no longer a faithful Dlink consumer after this experience. Having to pay shipping fees twice to return the router and paying a 15% restock fee I am out of $30 from my pocket. Next time I will just set flame to a 20 dollar bill and a 10 dollar bill.I am back to using my 7 or so year old DGL 4300 that has a failing WiFi radio until I can find a reputable Wireless Router to replace it."
5,Get one!,"This is awesome and easy to set up. I am not a computer genius and still no problems. I am sure that you will find it worth while and now am even using wireless printing and networking with this thing. Seriously, you won't be disappointed!"
2,False advertisment!!! the signal is weak!!!,"This unit does not do what it says. It does not give you stronger signal than any other unit!!! The configuration process is very easy and user friendly. The signal is weak. For once I would have liked amazon to make an error in my order, they never do!!, this product does not work!!"
2,Not that good,"I got a refurbished version of this and the generic password that comes with it doesn't work because someone has already used it. Therefore, you must call tech support for them to reset the router and install it in a different way online. I already had another router so getting online wasn't a problem but kind of a hassle. It took about 45 minutes to complete. I got this because I wanted to get wifi 2 floors down and on the other side of the house, it was worth a try. It didn't do the job in my situation. My wifi is only slightly better, but like I said I am in the basement and the router is on the 2nd floor and on opposing sides. I guess for my location the fact that my wifi is slightly better is a good thing."
3,1 Year after purchasing and it's already on the fritz,"It was a great router while it lasted but almost exactly a year after purchasing, I need to keep rebooting the router because the antenna will stop working."
1,Dropping connections all day,"I spent two days trying to get router working properly, but it constantly drops wireless connections.Quite annoying."
1,Buy it if you don't mind dropping connections more than 10 times a day,"I decided to buy a new router when my previous linksys WRT54G2 router didn't resolve DNS properly after 1 years' use, I finally chose this one because of its 4-star ranking. However, after using it for a week, I can't bear it any more because it drops connections more than 10 times a day. I am a game player and I can't afford losing the game simply because my router drops connection. Now I have no other choice but requesting a return. I hope I could get a full refund."
4,Changing network name fixes problems,"I used the configuration CD to set up a router/admin password. I kept the SSID name as dlink. I also kept the random WAP password it assigned.When I tried to wirelessly connect a laptop, it showed the WAP was not secure. I called tech support, who had me shut that laptop down.On the PC connected by cable to the router, she had me enter 192.168.0.1 in the IE address bar for the PC hardwired to the router.Once the page comes up, the password for the router/admin set up is entered.Click on Setup/wireless settings/Manual Wireless Network Setup.On the network name, she had me change it to a name that unique to me but did not broadcast that it was my router.She then had me change the preshared-key (WAP key) to something else.Then save changes.Then, booted a wireless laptop. It found the newly named secure network and was able to connect. I connected 5 more wireless computers and a Wii.There is something about changing the NETWORK NAME that makes it work."
3,Works well to a extent,"This device works OK, it has reception problems in parts of my home. I would look at another one that gets better reception than this unit."
1,DLink router - a dud,"Followed instructions for installation. Router worked for about 45 minutes, then browser started going very slow (3-4 minutes after each entry), frequently timing out. Three calls to technical support. They have a poor telephone system - noisy. They obviously are in India - strong accents. Followed instructions to upgrade firmware (shipped in 2012, but had older 2009 version it it?). Still no improvement. I continue to get the run-around, also intimations that the problem was in my computer. I finally gave up, purchased a NetGear N600. Worked flawlessly out of the box - no issues for 3 weeks now. Tried to get DLink to take back my unit - no dice. They are stonewalling me. DO NOT BUY DLINK products.D-Link DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router"
2,DIR-615 Router,"Just purchased this to replace cheaper DR-601 model. Well, not satisfied for a couple of reasons. My only wireless device is a Kindle Fire, which worked o.k. with cheaper router but the range was lacking. 20-30 feet away I couldn't watch Netflix on Kindle. So after researching, this DIR-615 seemed to fill the bill. Right off the bat after installing, I couldn't login with the Kindle. Wouldn't accept the password. Only after re-installing the router under OPEN security would the Kindle connect. The $30 DR-601 router did not have this issue. So now, operating with ""pants down and curtains wide open"", I decided to check the range of this new $70 router. Well, the signal dropped off at the same spot and to the same level of weak-signal as the $30 router. So I'm stuck. I'm not going to return this unit. But I'm dissatisfied."
1,Aweful firmwares from d-link,It worked for a while. However the firmware upgrades from d-link made the router less and less favorable -- they're buggy and hard to get everything set up correctly. The worst -- the latest firmware upgrade bricked my router and the built-in emergency backup system failed to bring the router back to life!
3,Close but no Cigar,Purchased for an application that went between two residential buildings (a house and a garage). Straight line distance of 118 Feet.Could only get a signal at about 100 feet so I returned the product.
4,Great speed and range but at first it killed my laptop,"Extreme N Cable Router has fantastic range and speed. My laptop seems like it's hooked directly to my DSL. For these reasons, I give it a good recommendation. BUT BE CAREFUL. Initially, it repeatedly gave me a blue screen of death in my two year old Dell laptop. I got tremendous help from cnet.com and got a cure. Althouth ""backward compatible"" in theory, I had to get updated drivers for the built in Intel wireless in my laptop. If you plug in the router for the first time, and within seven seconds your wireless computer crashes in a blue screen of death, turn off the wireless router, get online with a ""hard wire"" connection and get updated drivers. Do not take your laptop to a repair store. Out of range of the wireless router it will work fine and they will not understand your concern that there is a computer killing death ray at your home. BUT, once you get the cure, it's great."
3,USB Shareport not compatible with Mac OS 10,"The D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router works fine as a 802.11n wireless router. However, the reason I bought it was to wirelessly share my printer between two Macs using the USB Shareport on the router.Shareport is not compatible with Mac OS. After hours of searching the internet, I was disappointed to find that D-Link does not provide support for Mac OS 10.I bought this in combination with a D-Link DWA-140 Wireless USB Adapter. D-Link does not provide Mac support for the adapter, however I was able to find a free third-party driver that is compatible.The best solution for sharing a printer is to use an Apple Airport Express or Apple Airport Extreme.I returned both D-Link products and purchased an Airport Express. It was running in a couple minutes, and very easy to wirelessly share my printer."
1,"Unfortunately, it was broken","Theoretically, I liked this router. Unfortunately, it was broken. After spending many hours on the phone with customer services, I ended up returning this unit."
1,If You Run VISTA Avoid This Lemon - RUDE Tech Support Too,"If you're running VISTA and are using Microsoft Internet Explorer Ver. 7, forget this lemon. It will not work with Ver. 7.Also their tech support is not only incompetent but, to add insult to their product failure, they are disgustingly rude to boot!"
2,wireless router,"can't review at this time, my laptop is broken..so i can't tell you how good this is or not"
5,Works Great,"Installed with no problem. I added a linksys 5 port switch, added a Dlink Print Server. Everything seems to be working fine. Very happy."
5,Wireless system,Better item than what the internet company had and the cost was half of whatthey were selling. Directions were easy to understand and covers the area I need.
2,Did not work as expected,"We noticed when we received this router it had already been opened. It was possibly a returned item because it didn't work because it didn't work for us. We tried several times to set it up correctly, and every time there were problems. After about three resets and no wireless connection ability, we disconnected it and connected our old G router."
4,Took About A Year To Set Up,"Okay, maybe not that long. But it did take me a good hour and a half to two hours to set this thing up. However, after setting up, it hasn't stopped working on me yet (over the past 4 days) which is a plus, because the router I bought before this (Linksys G w/ speedbooster) sucked, and would stop working every 5 minutes. So, all in all, I like this router. Can't really comment on any speed enhancements or anything, however.(E) As far as speed, I'm usually working on 2 bars, which gives me about the same speed as my old ethernet connection. When I move around/have more bars, the speed is pretty blazing fast actually."
4,D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router.,"Thus far, this router has been fantastic. Its small enough to hide out of the way, and has enough range to cover our 2000 square foot house. The set-up for the router was easy, actual settings are somewhat daunting but the directions and customer service made tweaking all the settings to my liking a breeze. If your looking for a router to replace your broken one, or simply to update with the times then look no further."
5,Fast and Includes many features,I was able to turn my regular usb printer into a wireless printer. Has fast speed but has a mind of its own.
5,Great router.,I've had this router a grand total of 2 days and it's already way way better than my last router. Not to knock the last one; but this is far superior.
1,I am sending back a twice RMA'ed router that died three times.,"I can't understand how this router is considered usable. I was lucky that i got to get a refund on this because after trying to get RMA hardware on this new purchase, I could not get one that would stay online for more than a week. It took me two tries to get this done and I had to throw in the towel because I can't get a refund after so much time passes with Amazon. I am voting with my wallet on this one."
4,Great product but customer service is horrible.,"After a lot of research got this router mainly because it had a USB port on the router and have an external hard drive from Toshiba so thought could connect it to the router and have access to all music, movies and pictures on the hard drive.Overall satisfied with the ease of setup, the speed, and the looks of the router. Called customer support to get the hard drive to connect, very rude and looks like every thing I asked for was my problem and they could not do anything about it.If anyone know about how to set this up or a link where I can find instructions to set up the hard drive I would appreciate that. If this does not work I rather get a regular N router without the USB port for about half the price."
1,For Windows Vista just truble !!,"After 6 hours try installing on my computer (HP 3800 Athlon dual core, windows Vista) was imposible to run this router, spend three hours with d-link support and a trip to return this item, I will rate this product less one star, D-link support was rude, not a good experience, I got this router because the feedback this product have, maybe the same thing you do right now, but guess what? the router finally work like a champ was linksys WRT300N, this router don't have a really good feedback but work great on windows Vista, i take the time to write this review to save time to you, was terrible spend 6 hours trying to install this router!!"
3,Worked sort of,"The USB was hit and miss when it would work but the unit kept dropping ""N"" so when I turned ""N"" off it would work but then what's the point of this unit?D-Link customer support was good even though English is not their first language, communicating with them was easy and helpful.I returned the unit to Amazon and the process was painless and handled very well by them, they are a great company to to business with, I give Amazon 5 stars."
5,Researcher,"I have been searching router for many different kinds of brand.Extreme N is currently most useful for wireless condition. Comparing to other series of D-link product, DIR-655 is relatively acceptable price, although it is still a bit expansive. I use DIR-655 for 1 month already; the wireless range works pretty well because I live in a studio apartment. However, I will move to two floors house tomorrow, and it would be interesting whether the router will work fine or not. The Wi-Fi works for whoever needs to use wi-fi, which is good to have it. The usb port supports to use public harddrives, printers, etc. DIR-655 includes most of funtion I need. Hope you will find this helpful."
3,unreliable usb port,"Just as I read in many other reviews, the usb/printer port either doesn't work or is unreliable. After finally getting it to work I was happy but not for long. It may work for a while then you have to play around with it then it's okay for a while again. I finally just disconnected the printer and said to hell with it. If I had to do it over I would get the model under it with out the usb port or get the comparable ASUS unit."
4,"Great For Streaming Video, Set-Up Difficult","After nearly two-years my old Netgear G router died, so seeing that this D-Link N router was relatively inexpensive and, from the reviews, very popular, I ordered it. On my old router, streaming Netflix through my PS3 was slow, and could take probably 15 seconds to start, but this D-Link does it in no more than 3 seconds. I did hit a little snag on initial installation. The accompanying CD installation software failed to set-up the router automatically, and the screen instructed me to do a manual set-up. I'm not very tech-savvy, but I did manage on my own to get it working after a couple of hours.After three-weeks of use I'm very happy with it, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a router, but with a warning to the novice that installation can be difficult, though, once it's up and running it's fast."
4,D-Link DIR-655 Extreme,"Conflicts when using with Linksys wireless connected to D-Link port. Linksys sync's right up and D-Link will not. Customer service pushed it for off for me to contact Linksys, so next time I buy Linksys"
5,Very pleased with this router,"I've always had problems with my NetGear router dropping and hanging, and had been getting much worse lately, so finally decided to replace it. Glad I did! I've had the D-Link DIR-655 installed for around 4 weeks, and so far it hasn't dropped once. We typically have 1 computer connected via ethernet and 3-4 via wireless, plus a network printer. Speed is fantastic, security appears very robust, and has tons of features like the USB attachment. I setup the USB attachment to a Seagate external drive, and with the D-Link SharePort provided software, within around 30 minutes I had 3 computers able to use the drive attached to the router's USB - very convenient! Setup also worked fine, just followed the quick install guide software, it did pretty much everything, was very intuitive. Very happy with this router!"
1,It was great for about 1.5 years.,"I bought this router from amazon in the beginning of 2009. Here I am in October of 2010 and now I get disconnected every day, sometimes several times a day, and I have to manually reboot it.I don't like the lack of key features, like monitoring and managing broadband usage of individuals on the network.The warranty is for only 1 year. The problem is that the router worked for 1.5 years. I thought I was paying up to future-proof etc. I ended up throwing money down the drain! I'll never buy D-link products again!"
3,Too much for the average user,"I used to be computer techie kind of person; I've built computers, fixed computers, installed networks -- but it's been awhile and I don't have any interest in getting that technical anymore. That being said, I handle most computer related tasks pretty well and I found this router fairly challenging on some of the advanced issues. It's much more than the average home user needs. I originally bought it thinking we were going to switch our phone service to VoIP, and I liked the hard drive sharing option. The WPA security features ended up interfering with a lot of the stuff we have hooked up to wireless, so DLink's answer was just to switch it to WEP mode. We still have things that used to work on our old router that don't work with this one. The SecureSpot software built into the router is really annoying and I disabled that too. For what I'm using the router for, a more basic model would have done the job."
5,Does everything I wanted,"This is my first experience with a wireless router, and it does everything I wanted it to. I can access the internet on my laptop from the other side of my house, and my son has his XBox 360 connected to it (also from the other side of the house), and there's no interference between the gaming system and the computer. Very nice!"
1,D-Link N-wireless router,The product arrived in good condition but was defective. Two Microsoft engineers worked with me for several hours over two days to get this router to work in my network. No luck. We returned the router and purchased a new Netgear N-router. It was installed in 10 minutes and works perfectly.
5,Extreme Wireless Router is good,"This router is easy to set up, and works great. It comes with a set up disk with a set up wizard. Also a brief guide for manual set up. Security is also provided, but is a little more obscure in the set up."
3,Needed to do more research,This product is ok but I am constantly having problems with it dropping my internet connection and causing a problem with my computer configuration for internet settings. I researched for weeks and thought this would be great but maybe I should have looked harder and longer.
2,Crapshoot,"Even though the first one would not set up at all, the second managed to work for almost FIVE months before it died. I went to a Linksys 3200 dual-band and had even bigger problems once I FINALLY got IT working. Linksys insists on a 192.168.1.1 router setting which plays havoc with wireless Blu-ray players, wireless TVs, iPhones, etc. So now I'm going back to the D-Link DIR-655, even though I'll have to buy a couple every year."
1,Will not entirely work with Windows 7 - Tech Support Horrible,"USB port will not work with Windows 7.D-Link tech support is horrible. I've been trying to get my printer set up with the usb in the router, without success. I've now gone through five tech calls, each offering nonsense solutions, like reboot, or turn off anti virus. On my sixth call, I spoke with someone who said he was a tech supervisor. He said that the usb port will not work with Windows 7. He said many other people have reported this issue, and that I should search the various support boards and listservs about this. This router is soon to be returned."
2,Sucks for Xbox 360,"Bought this router for my Xbox 360 and so others in my house could get wireless. While their wireless was fine I am having a pain trying to configure it with my xbox. I have contacted customer support only to get a ""well thats weird"" from them.Don't buy for a 360."
1,Did I get a lemon?,"It looks nice and sets up pretty easy, however, the one I got started giving me problems. I have had it for a few months and now the wireless connectivity will fail to initialize. I had a D-Link before this one and it always worked great and after several years I wanted to upgrade it. But the DIR-655 did not work as well and now only the wired ports work, the wireless will not work longer than 60 seconds or so before it fails again. I am very dissappointed in a product this expensive that performs so terrible.Perhaps it is just a lemon, but since it is over 30 days it runs beyond its return policy! There goes a Benjamin Franklin that just got burned."
2,Impossible to Configure,"This router was nearly impossible to configure. I couldn't get it to work with any of my wireless peripherals, from a Slingbox device to a wireless repeater to a powerline adaptor. Nor could anyone I know get their laptop to join the router's wireless network.I don't know what the problem was, but once I re-installed my old Linksys router, everything worked again.Routers seem unnecessarily complicated to operate and configure. They are basically the most consumer-unfriendly devices being sold. Next I will purchase an Apple router, hopefully they've come up with an easier solution"
3,Excellent range but keeps dropping wireless connection.,"Overall, the DIR-655 has a much better wireless range than my old DI-634M but the DIR-655 keeps dropping my wireless connection after about 5 mins for about 2 to 5 seconds. I researched the net and tried every tip I could find but was only able to get it to keep a connection for at most 30 mins. I don't have any interference and live on a 2 acre plot.Since I use the slingbox on my laptop a lot, the disconnects were unacceptable to me. I eventually had to return the DIR-655 back to Amazon and I have just received the TrendNet TEW-633GR instead.This model is almost identical to the DIR-655 and so far after 2 hours, I have not had a connection drop with the TEW-633.I'll update if I notice any changes."
3,lasted for about a week,"The DIR-655 was easy to intall, but the wireless portion of the router died a week later. Tech support recommended that it be returned and gave me a case number."
3,DLDIR655,As the previous products of D-link very easy to install/connect. Excellent range of response for the wireless part. The only down side is that the share USB port does not work; the same happened in the previous model. Technical support assistant from D-Link people and/or web site poor to non existant. I have contact them through e-mail 3 times they haven't even bother to response or acknoledge my inquire.
5,D-Link Wireless Router -- fantastic.,"The D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router product I got a couple of weeks ago works fantastically well. Installation was a breeze, and the speed is noticeably faster than the previous wireless router it replaces (the older one ""broke""). No glitches whatsoever. What else can I say? I am smiling."
1,Bad product no support incompetent technology,"Dlink DIR655 extreme N router doesn't work as advertised. Tech supportis uninformed, naive, and unfamiliar with technology. DMZ doesn't work.Firewall is undefeatable. Packets on DMZ placed IP node are filtered.UDMP multicasting discovery protocols will not work properly on the LAN,even with routers multicasting switches enabled. I'm suspecting that theBelkin product may be a better bet.It's fast, but tech support on this product is about on the level of Linksys. . . which is to say . . . Godawful. . .K."
1,Duped by Amazon,"Amazon sends out older version of the hardware. It's v4 now, but Amazon sends out v3. I guess Amazon becomese a surplus dumping ground."
3,Misleading Info on Box.,The box states that this router has 1 usb 2.0 port. What they don't say on the box is that the function of this port has been limited by them only to the use a flash drive to install network settings. I would think if you state you have a usb 2.0 port then you should be able to connect to another device with a simular port as per the specifications outlined for this type of port. What would you think of a car that advertised it had an automatic transmission only to find out after you bought it that the automatic part was only from first to second gear? The only thing extreme about this router is the amount of B.S. that d-link expects us to lap up.
1,Did not work!,Bought it and it did not work right!! Keeps doing a DNS error that never happens with my other router! This is junk! Don't Buy!
2,Serious frequent connection droping problems,I bought this router to replace my Actiontec router. Actiontec router supports only wifi g type connections but is very stable.To improve the speed I bought Dlink DIR-655 router about a month ago and since then I am having very frequent connection droping problems. I have tried almost every option and configuration suggested but this problem seems to be in the basic design of this product. This router is fast but only when it works.I am going back to my old Actiontec router.
5,C.,I concur with other reviews that this router is a solid performer. So far it produces a faster rate than the Xtreme N router - I own both.
3,Mmmpgh...,"My first experience with home networking or Wi-Fi. So I thought I'd get a top-o-za-line unit. Worked immediately with my XP machine and continues to work flawlessly there, but not my gf's Vista box. She's gone through weeks of trying different drivers, blue-screen crashes,...ugh! Also, on a good day my work laptop works fine, on others I'll lose Internet for no apparent reason every hour or so. Don't know what's to blame for that. Wireless signal is VERY strong - just stops accessing the outside world. I have not attempted to contact the manufacturer."
4,Solid router,"This is a very solid router. It was reasonably easy to set up and has been a solid performer. The reason for only 4 stars is the administrative interface. It is somewhat jumbled and it is not always clear where you need to go for some of the settings. Netgear is much better on this front as far as I'm concerned, but this D-Link has been a lot more reliable than the Netgear offerings."
4,I'm Pleased,"An I.T. professional recommended this wireless router. It works great and it was easy to get it up and running. I live in an apartment and I have no trouble keeping a wireless connection between rooms. This router works very well, but keep in mind you must have a good internet speed. I recommend this product. It even comes with a small black stand so the router can stand vertically. (Takes up less space!)"
1,Wireless drops several times daily.,No improvement in range over my old router. While router has to be reset several times a day for wireless to connect. I have tried all the fixes suggested by the D-Link forums to help with the problem and nothing has helped. I have given up and have ordered a Cisco-Linksys router.
2,No improvement over 5 year old Linksys router,"I bought this in an attempt to increase the wifi range of my router. I recently moved my modem location to the far end of my home, and my old Linksys b/g router couldn't throw a signal to the other end of the house. I figured a brand new ""n"" router would do the trick. Note I also upgraded my cable modem to something top of the line.While I have no complaints about setup or the ability to connect, the signal strength is not one bit better than my old router. Not sure why it advertises ""6 times the range!""If you need a router, sure, but if you are trying to upgrade, don't waste your money."
2,Poor quality control,"I got this router to replace my linksys that just keeled over. I hadn't had very much with the linksys so I decided to try a different brand. The first one I received would not power on and I had to return it (no issues there - Amazon made it super easy to return.) The second one powered on with no problem but one of the connectors for the antennas is broken. I can't wait another week for the return process so I'm just using it as-is. It seems to work ok, but I would not recommend it due to these quality control issues."
1,Headed for the Trash,"I bought this unit in Nov '11 to replace a Netgear WRG614, which up until then, had been performing yeoman-like service. You see I had bought a Samsung Blu-ray player and I wanted to hook it up to Hulu and some other video download sites. I thought it the Netgear was a bit slow and I needed a faster unit and the D-Link with its 3 antennas looked promising.Well it's been nothing but a problem. It doesn't seem to reach as far in my home as the Netgear. Every time I fire the Blu-ray player up it has forgotten how to locate the internet. The instructions are confusing & I'm tired of having Samsung, D-Liink and my ISP all point their finger at the other guys. Who needs it.It's trash."
2,Not worth it for the price.,"I bought this to replace my $40 Belkin after it crapped out on me. When I got it I attempted to install it using the driver it came with. And of course, it didn't work. So I had to call up D-link and after about 30mins or so got it working. The customer service was nice, and I'm not complaining, but there's no reason I should have to call them to get the thing working. I get off the phone and don't even bother checking the Wifi which was a mistake. I was getting about 26Mbps! I couldn't even download updates for my anti-virus software. Even my labtops which have great built in wireless cards were getting low Mbps. I was getting 54Mpbs+ with my Belkin, and I have to be right next to the D-Link to get that. The only reason why I give it 2 stars is because I paid $30 and not $70 for it."
5,"Works great, super fast.","Strong signal, does get a little warm, just keep it elevated and everything is fine. I've had this router for over two years now and it has worked flawlessly."
2,USB Storage does not work,"The unit operates like the last three WAP's I have owned. It does seem faster, but this is my first N.The USB storage feature does not work. The box says:""With SharePort technology you can connect a USB printer or storage device to your router and allow users to access them from anywhere on the network. Conveniently turn your existing USB printers and storage devices into network devices for everyone to share.""It does not work. I plug the USB drive into the port and it only seems to be accessible through a single computer with the sharepoint software installed. I expected this to work as a NAS, where the drive appears on the network places."
4,D-Link DIR-655 is extremely easy to set up and to use,"The D-Link DIR-655 is so easy to set up, espcially the way the wizard coaches me how to set up the security feature with pass code. It works very well so far for us. The wireless range is work fine in our house arrangement. I'm quite happy with this unit as this is the 1st time I got D-Link brand, and the 3rd time buying a wrieless router box."
4,Just found cheaper at walmart,Good product but its sold cheaper at walmart. I just figured it would be cheaper at amazon as they are usually cheaper.
5,V. Good wireless router,"Our old router seemed to slowly loose speed and range as the years went by. And my wifes iPhone just wouldn't link to it. Easy to install - well, my son did it! All computers, wired and wireless now working much better."
5,A Good Buy,"The wireless router was easy for a non technical person to set up and has been working great since it was set up a month ago. A great value for home wireless. My TV, Satellite, Blu-Ray and even my phone work great with this."
3,QOS Engine not compatible with all ISPs,"Initally, this router worked fine. But after several weeks the modem (SB6120) kept locking-up and requiring a power reset to get it working again. This happened almost every 1-2 days. I went in circles between the ISP (Cox Comm) and Motorola (modem) in attempts to find the cause of the internet loss. With no luck, I just systematically turned on all non-essential services on this router until the modem no longer locks-up. It turns out that the Dlink QOS engine was the culprit. So, with QOS disabled, I have no more problems with the internet drops."
4,A little more power a little more price,"I bought this router in an effort to improve my throughput in my home. Actually I see no difference in performance, other than being a little prettier. If you can settle for your current router, do it. Don't waste the money on something that may not really improve your performance. Wait until Draft O comes out in a couple years."
5,Great Router,This router has excellent range and excellent speed. I had a linksys G router before this and this one gets about twice the range and downloads about 1.5 times faster than my previous router. I would recommend this router to anyone who is interested in buying a new router.
3,Not deserve the price.,"Too expensive if you buy it at a normal price, I will prefer ASUS RT-N16 or even E3000 from Linksys. But DIR-655 has a nice base to let the device standing vertically which the latter lack."
5,D-Link DIR-655 Extreme,This router is used for a small office network and is used as a wired router. It is easy to set up and data is fast.
5,completely satisfied,This was easy to set up; I had no trouble and I am not a computer whiz. I am extremely pleased with how well it works. This is the first router I have ever purchased and set up and highly recommend it to anyone.
5,"So many bars, I'm feeling tipsy!","I thought I was going to have to hardwire my new house and buying this router was the last attempt before throwing in the towel. I had tried two routers before buying this one and couldn't get more than 1 bar in other rooms, now I have 5 throughout. Highly recommend."
5,"Good product, very satisfied",This is a quality product. It works well throughout the house - nice strong signal. I use it with my Roku box and it works great.
1,Disappointing router,"I had high expectations for this router based on reviews. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold a candle to the Linksys I replaced. It was easy to install but that's where the praise stops. The signal strength is much lower on all devices being used in the same places throughout the house. Worse yet, the signal is dropped entirely at intermittant times meaning streaming video is a nightmare to watch. I wish I hadn't installed my old router at my mothers! Now I will toss this one and buy something other than D-Link new."
4,Works As Intended,"The router works as stated. The installation disk that comes with the box makes it very simple to setup your wireless router for the entire household (or wherever you're installing it). The disk also ensures that even a beginner at setting up a wireless connection could do so properly with basic security also established. Unrelated to the mechanics of the router, I thoroughly enjoyed the compact appeal of the router as well. Though it does tend to generate heat more so than my previous routers that I've installed."
1,"Will not connect at N speeds, maxes out at 65 mbps.","I bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless N speeds. It would max out at 65 mbps. When I reset it, like unplugging it and plugging it back in, I would get the N speeds 150 mbps the first time it connected and would transfer files at that speed, then usually next time I connected it would drop back to 65 or 52 mbps and stay at these speeds. I Googled ""d-link dir-655 65 mbps max"" and found that a lot of people are having this problem. Called their support, they didn't have a clue so I returned it and I am looking for something else that will give me 150 mbps."
1,Shareport doesn't work... for anybody.,"I purchased this router mainly for its usb shareport ability. It doesn't work though. I went online to see what the problem was. Turns out shareport doesn't work for anybody. It worked when it first came out, but an update to the software rendered it extremely un-reliable. It will connect for about a day, and then you have to reboot the router to get it working again.Total crap product. I wouldn't buy this router if you plan to use its shareport functions. Otherwise, the router works fine."
2,Not the router for me... The search continues for a decent router,"Bought this router last week after seeing all of the positive reviews online. After a week of using, I will be returning. I have to reset this router everyday. I even bought the D-Link ANT24-0230 Xtreme N 2.4GHz Antenna to replace the stock antennas and nothing. I'm going to go ahead and fork out $179.00 for the Apple airport extreme because I'm so done with the router search. Belkin, D-Link, Netgear...all junk so far. Come on Apple!"
2,Bad range,I had trouble setting up this router. Only because I followed the easy setup wizard. The range is worse than my older wireless g router. But the ratings say it is better. Whats up with that. I definitely wouldn't recommend due to range and no wireless bridge capability according to d-link. Isn't this suppose to be a wireless router. My old router has wireless bridging capabilities.D-Link DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router
1,Defective out of the box.,"I bought this along with the DWA-140 wireless adapter and had high hopes for a long range, fast network. After an hour with tech support, they told me to return it."
2,Died after 2 months use,"I've used D-Link routers for years and this is the 1st dud. It worked perfectly until this morning. I woke up and the the lights were dark. I plugged it into another power supply, still nothing. I hooked up my old D-Link 615 and worked like a charm. I guess I just got a bad unit. It worked beautifully until this morning, no complaints. But now, I'm out my $70."
2,Trouble and more Trouble,This thing worked terribly for me. The web interface often did not work. Had to push stuff over and over. My VOIP would not work and I could not forward the necessary ports to get it working. Performance was also sub par.
5,Great Product,"Bougth this product as a replacing for DIR-615. No more bottlenecks,buffering and slowness. Also able to use all security features of Network Magic with DIR-655"
2,"Nice Features and Price, If It Worked","Wow, are there any really good wireless N routers out there? Maybe one but this isn't it. I researched thoroughly prior to settling on the DIR-655. I was replacing an existing G router because I wanted the higher wireless speed as well as gigabit ethernet. After spending nearly two hours trying to set this up, I gave up. It kept assigning conflicting IP addresses or none at all. I assumed it was defective and ordered a replacement from Amazon. Amazon of course has great service and overnighted one to me. Unfortunately, I had the same exact issue with the replacement.I spent over an hour on the phone both with my ISP (Time Warner) and D-Link. D-Link's tech support is horrible and basically worthless unless it's something obvious. So I ended up returning both units and going with a Netgear N-300. It set up immediately and has worked great so far."
2,Excellent for a while,"I have this unit 13 months today and the wi-fi quit working. Up until now it was great. Fast, reliable, etc.. Wired still works. Status says it is broadcasting, but SSID is nowhere to be found or shows up briefly with 0% strength. I can see all my neighbors less powerful routers, but not mine. After troubleshooting myself for several hours then on the phone with tech support for 2-3 hours, decided it was defective. BUT they will not replace the product since they only have a 1 yr warranty. I expect more service from my investment. I will not be replacing it with another Dlink."
3,Easiest set up so far,after reading the previous reviews I did not bother with the automatic setup...just went with the manual and worked fine.PROS After going through 56L 100 MB and now 300 MB routers this was by far the easiest to set up. speed is fine.CONS Combined with the 141 USB adapter was hoping this would increase my range significantly from the 100 mb router to my notebook. No dice. Same distance as the old router which only had two antennas. Had to configure a port manually to allow outgoing faxes.
1,PRODUCT WORSE THAN I CAN EVER EXPECTED AND NO TECH SUPPORT,I usually don't bother to write reviews on anything purchased from any website. but this time I am so angry and frustrated about this product and company. A drand new router for sure is not working.It need to be rebooted 3-4 times a day to send wifi signals. I called tech support three times. no way to fix the prob. when i ask for a replacement. They kick me around like a ball. it is a real pain even just to replace one. DO NOT EVER BUY DLINK PRODUCTS!
4,D-Link: most reliable router,This has been a very reliable router.The signal is very strong and I'm able to easily connect from every spot in my house and yard though the router resides at a back room. I've been running this router for a few months now where a bunch of house guests have connected to it (if I were more paranoid I would be quite alarmed at the number of individuals having the password to my wireless network!) - and never had any issues connecting and maintainig a connection. This router has so many feature and customization options as well. It is relatively easy to do installation and configuration. I'm not a network expert but I was able to set both the wire and wireless connections quite easily with the wizards and documentation and even turn wireless security on in no-time. Connecting to the wireless network with my laptop proved quite painless and simple - even after trying for the first time connecting to a WPA2 secured wireless network with a WiFi enabled smartphone!
3,"OK, but not the expected range","The unit set up quickly and all worked once I remembered to power cycle my cable modem. It is fast, but I am not getting the extended wireless range that I had hoped. I bought the unit because my cable modem sits in an office at one end of the house and we sit wit iPads and laptops in a living room at the other end. Reception did improve, but is still marginal. I need to explore relocation the router as much as possible.What I really need is a repeater, but have been unable to find one that works."
5,Excellent Router,"After a long search for a good wireless router i decided to buy the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router. I really don't know why there's so much people who ""have average knowledge"" on hooking up wireless routers and yet they have a hard time hooking this one up. From the minute I opened it to the minute i finish installing it, it didn't take me more than 10 minutes. I believe it took me more time removing the old Linksys than setting up this one. About the random disconnections... I have experience them but no more that the old Linksys WRT54GL, maybe once or twice from the date i hooked it up. I noticed a slight bump in speed but not a dramatic one, the thing that i love it the range. I can get signal in places i didn't with the Linksys. Excellent router, excellent signal strength, fast delivery. Love it."
1,should never bought this unit,"I purchased this unit and spent hours trying to get it to work correctly, the unit says that it is right, but won't connect to the internet. I have reset this unit more than 10 times, but it won't work. I have wasted my money."
1,Consider another,"The Dlink DIR-655 had no noticeable improvement in range and speed over the old DI-624. To be fair we are not set up for Extreme N yet. The DIR-655 quit after one week and after an hour with Dlink support running diagnostics we were instructed to return the router to Amazon as defective.Try the TRENDnet TEW-633GR instead. It is easier to set up, seems to be slightly faster and have a greater range, and cost a few dollars less. We have been using the TRENDnet for three months and haven't had to reboot it yet. One review wrote that this router is more suitable for DSL, which is what we are currently using."
1,Mac support sucks,"I bought it, read the manual, never took the router out of the box, and returned it. Although this device says it is compatible with Mac OS 10.4, it does not come with a Mac installation CD. The instructions in the manual didn't make sense and after several calls to tech support (and elevation to tier 2) , I was finally told not to pay any attention to the specific instructions clearly printed in the manual. When I persisted in asking for help, the tier 2 tekkie got angry and hung up on me. Sounds like it might be a great router, but I think I'll stick with the Airport Extreme."
1,Very expensive for a blue light/internet bottleneck.,Slowed my internet down. Went from 10gigs to 5.5ish. Even slowed my wired internet down. The eight year old Linksys B this replaced (due to it needing reboots 4x daily) was faster both in wired and wireless forms. Apparently it's really sensitive to the type of wire it needs. Lame.To remedy this I searched for solutions on the appropriate forums and via technical support. The forums were helpful but made no progress (and I found evidence of others having similar issues).The D-Link customer service was just plain unhelpful. After a few unhelpful suggestions they suggested I sit and wait a while and call back tomorrow. Right.
1,Wireless stinks let me explain,"I got this last december when a local office store had it on sale for under 100. It setup well and I was able to do many things with it. The place I take issue is this when I had it hooked up at our house I found the wireless would go down every 6 days this was a regular occurrence. Every six days bloop no wireless. I reset it rolled back firmware it would not work and stay up when I needed it. I thought at first it was my dsl modem. So I changed that, I changed settings did not fix it, I even searched the blogs to see if I could find a solution no dice same dealio. I finally changed my router to an Apple Airport Extreme no issues anymore. If I need networking I'll go to Cisco, maybe Belkin, or like I did go to Apple. I will not use Dlink for critical networks ever again! LEt me make this a quick read Stay away from this router, stay away from DLink save your money and get a Cisco, Belkin, or Apple."
3,Was a 4-star until I upgraded to 1.32NA firmware,"My DIR-655 was working great until I upgraded the firmware to version 1.32NA. As long as they are not shipping new units with 1.3x software, it will be a great home router. If it comes with 1.3x firmware, it will be slow and require a reboot about every couple of days.I would like to have a little more flexibility on filtering access. It only has one website list, so if you have a mixture of age groups, you have to choose the most pressing needs. You can't block certain sites for one user and then another group of sites for another user.Before the upgrade it was fast and reliable, though I kept it set for WPA only and not WPA2 because I seemed to have more issues with connectivity on WPA2, especially with Windows PCs.If they get their firmware fixed, I would change my rating to a 4-star, but this broken firmware that doesn't allow a downgrade is four months old, so who knows how long I will have make regular trips downstairs to reboot the router."
1,AVOID Until 1.32NA Fixed!,"After 30 days, the DIR-655 could not pick up a WAN address from Comcast. I started with FW 1.21 and tried all the downgradeable FW versions before reluctantly upgrading to 1.32NA. There's no change. Dlink support has strung me along for a week now... ""Please reset, reset, reset"". My PC connects just fine directly to the (dlink) cable router.An old Belkin G router connects just fine.(sigh) Looks like I'm gonna have to buy a Linksys. No more Dlink for me."
2,A pain to work with,"It works fine once you get it installed and set up, but pretty much every screen requires a restart which makes it pain to use."
4,Great product,"Although the antenna connections can be a bit flimsy at times (I mean they can break somewhat easily), it's still a great product with many features and options. The range is okay, but overall, I have enjoyed it."
1,Don't believe the Hype,"Got it, read all this stuff above about it having special way of syncing the data properly. Signal wasn't that strong at all (they say good for big houses) I'm in a Small House!!!.....Bought a Dual Band (Cool looking Diamond Asus one)....... worth the extra $20 and I'm a cheapsk8."
5,Best wireless router I've owned,I love this router. I've been using it for over a year with no issues. The signal is strong throughout our house. I recently bought an external hard drive and connected it to the USB and now we can back up pictures and other files from several different computers to one external hard drive easily.
1,Work great for a short while,Do your homework before purchasing this router. It is plagued by firmware issues since day one. I cannot connect both g and n it is an either or. I currently have a bricked DIR-655 due to a firmware update. Search the web for DIR-655 firmware issues. Do Not Buy This Router.... You are better off with an engenius product or and seperate wired router with an wireless accesspoint connected to that.
5,great range for the money,"This D-Link router is great. It has a great range: it sits in my living room, and I can access the WiFi anywhere in the house. The basement, my garage, any bedroom... well worth the money!"
2,CCTV Security Camera's DVR and port forwarding problems,"I should of listened to the reviews about getting the port forwarding to work on this D-Link D-655. I gave up after 3 days of fooling with this D-655 and went back to my Linksys and I was up and running in 10 minutes. For some reason when I opened a port to allow access to my DVR Security cameras so I could use my iPhone or laptop to log into my DVR it wouldn't work. I could only log into my DVR within my internal network(LAN). I do have a static IP, I could not get the D-655 to see my DVR over the internet at all no matter what I did. I tried everything, I had a knowledgeable Tech try and I called D-Link tech support, Called my ISP tech support and all attempts failed. If you're NOT doing port forwarding then this router might work ok for you! I'm sending it back for a refund!"
4,"Great Router, Vonage Faxing Issues","This router is wonderful for wireless and wired connectivity. Fast, stable and very configurable, almost too configurable in some ways. It was so much faster than my previous router using the same network cables and cable modem, over 2000Kbps faster according to DSLreports speed tests. I was able to make it do everything I wanted to except send faxes using my Vonage phone service. Even the phone calls were fine, but did have a noticeable hissing sometimes. Now before you dismiss this as a Vonage problem and not that router, I plugged back in my old Microsoft Broadband Networking Wireless Base Station | MN-700 and the faxing once again works with no issues. For some reason this new router puts too much line noise for any faxes to work, even after dropping the speed, turning off error correction and many other things. A great router overall, with one glaring problem that made me completely unable to use it. 4 stars, would be 5 if the Vonage service worked fully."
5,MUCH MUCH Better than Linksys,Have used the Linksys WRTG54S and several Linksys expanders to cover my 2 story home. The whole linksys security deal with the expanders is a nightmare.I plugged the D-Link in and it absoulutely covered all the area that the Linksys did and then some - straight out of the box. The speed is amazing. In my market Charter offers 20 meg down and 2 meg up - the DLink handles it effortlessly. I have run Skype/Messenger/NetFlix movies simultaneously.I can't imagine using any other product again.
1,It works - but no extra distance and not worth the upgrade,"Upgrade is all hype. I upgraded from my 5 year old Linksys WRT54 G router, since the wireless didn't reach the upstairs back two bedrooms. I bought the router and upgraded the laptop with a dual bank N card. All I needed was 8 feet additional distance, but discovered this router didn't help at all. Back to the store and back to my old reliable 5 year old router"
4,"Great product, but...","It is important to remember that if you have a slower device (e.g., 802.11b) it slows down the whole network..."
4,D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router,"The router works fine once you get it set up. I haven't had a great of experience in setting up wireless networks and I had some difficulty getting this one up and working. But, overall, I'm quite satisfied with it. A lot faster than my old network."
1,Can I Leave Zero Stars?,"Wow, what an awful router. I'm no stranger to computer hardware and I've tried every (poorly documented and ill conceived) solution typical to wireless router as well as those specifically recommended by D-Link. From firmware, configurations, channels, different ISPs, different physical locations in the house as well as multiple residences. The results are the same... bad or worse.D-Link's Dir-655 short-bus offering stutters along with anemic speeds, frequent disconnects and all around wretched performance. I can safely say that the old WRT-54G sitting in my trunk of tech, outperforms the D-Link Dir-655. Honestly, they should have called it the F-Link Duh-655.Do not, under any circumstance waste a penny on this router. You could not GIVE me one for FREE, and I wouldn't wish this router on my worst enemy. Lesson learned, stay away from D-Link, they have no business being in the router industry."
1,Bad quality,"Just like alot of other reviewers on this site I also keep getting internet downtime. Tired of messing with firmware updates and redoing stepups, going to buy another brand router."
2,Only Lasted 3 Years,"Can't stand it when you spend almost a hundred bucks on a tool (that's basically what routers are), and it suddenly stops working within 3 years. While it worked, it was fine. Range and speed were fine. Never had any issues. But then just after the 3-year mark, it died. Not sure if other wireless routers last any longer though as our previous one was a Linksys, and it died after about 3 years as well. So, the new strategy I'm going to test is to buy a cheap one (decent speed but cheap), and see if it makes it to 3 years...."
1,Ridiculous...does not do as advertised,"I have decided that the best way to solve this issue is to stop people from making the same mistake as me. If you were hoping to use the ""share port"" feature to set up a wireless print server or wireless external hardrive DO NOT BUY. The Share Port program does not work and in over 2 years, dlink has still not corrected the problem. Not only that, but dlink refuses to admit the problem is their firmware and rectify it with customers. Don't believe me? sift through these two forums and 20 pages of issues reporting the same problem.[...][...]"
3,works 52 steps away from unit,"I can sit in back yard and pick up reception. I'm 5'4"" it works 52 steps away from unit. That is the range I pick up through 2 1 and a half foot thick walls. Home is on one level.The lights are so bright it is like a night light in a room. Too bad cuz I hate to waste energy. So I put it on a cut off power strip."
5,Excellent product,"Have only had this router for a couple of weeks, but noticed the speed difference immediately. So far no problems."
2,D655,"Worked great for about 3 weeks then nothing. I reset it, reconfigured it and nothing. Worked great when it worked."
3,"Good features, average wireless performance","Pros-Great amount of features and customization-Awesome 1GBPS wired connection-Good priceCons-disappointing wireless speed. Built in ""good neighbor policy"" is prohibiting wireless n to run at 300mbps and instead falls back to 150mbps.Overall: Great unit if your neighborhood is not congested with wireless networks"
1,Half the speed from the actual Internet service provider,"RCN offers me a speed of 20Mbps. If I connect my macbook directly to the modem I get speeds of 19-20Mbps. However If I use this router, I get speeds of about 5,7 Mbps and am about 3,4 feet away from the router. It sucks...."
1,D-Link makes promises...,"that this product doesn't keep for them. Could not get stable N speeds from this router in a professional SOHO setting, after countless hours of fiddling with it, and several devices it was connecting.As usual, there are plenty of bugs and undocumented features in the firmware...Half-baked wireless N firmware."
4,D-Link DIR-655 Comments by Lasertrimman,I bought the D-Link DIR-655 to replace my unreliable U.S. Robotics (USR5461). I needed a router as well as print server. I wanted an N band wireless connection as well as the older G band capability. D-Link claims its 655 will do it all and so it does. I must say that the virtual printer connection was very difficult to set up. The firmware with the hardware and the drivers on the hard disk were all too old and not up to the task. So the first thing to do is get online and find the newest firmware and drivers and load them in. Then go online and Google problems with the printer (and any other USB device) connection and follow their recommended settings if you have problems like I did. The great news is that I have not had to reboot the router once since I got the box 1 month ago.
2,no big deal,"I purchased this to replace my wireless G. The reception is worse and the downloads are no different. My 35 dollars wireless router was just as good or better than this one, too bad I sold it to my friend."
1,Great -- but doesn't work,"Purchased this router but could never get it working in wireless mode with my laptop. The connection would drop every 1 to 2 minutes with a message in the log saying ""authentication failed"". Most times it would reconnect immediately, but sometimes wouldn't. Basically it was unusable as is. Support tried a bunch of things, but in the end told me to return it.My laptop is frequently used on other wireless networks without a problem, and the DIR-655 replaced an older, cheaper Belkin which worked. So it's not environmental, like phones etc. It must be a flaw in the router.This seems to be a common problem with this router: try googling ""DIR-655 authentication failed"""
3,DiLink DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Routeer,"Not too impressed with signal strength of this router. I had a G router from Linksys that would work from 100 yards away, this one only goes about 30-45. However setup was easy and it works fine."
1,Overpriced junk,I bought this to replace a 4 year older wireless N router that broke. I only use it to stream internet to my Roku box. My old router got 4 bars to my roku box and fast downloads and streaming. The new router only one i can tell a differences in video quality. It broke after 3 months of use.Pros- easy setupCon- crap range and signal strength- overpriced- Broke after 3 months of use- unit is garabage
1,do not buy this one,it constantly disconnect. and heat is a horrible thing. do not buy this one. save some money for other branch ..
2,Not what I expected from D-Link,"The wired portion works great. The wireless drops out at least a couple times a day. The wireless doesn't even show up on the ""Available Wireless Networks"". If I unplug it and plug it in again it works fine. I have been all over the internet looking for ""The Answer"". What I see is ""It could be this or could be that"" It would be nice if D-Link had ""The Answer""."
1,EXPENSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Only worked right for a couple months. Started to slow down and drop the connection.Needs to be reset at least 3 times a day. Not very reliable,not very well built, not made to last. Broadcast range: not that great either.I think perhaps I will not be buying D Link products in the future, because I think I wasted a lot of time and money goofing around with a sub-standard product.Wireless products overall: not that great. You are much better off using a wired connection. I am not sure that there is really any wireless router that lives up to it's promises."
2,Not working,"I have been trying to get the DIR-655 to work with my Dell system. I have contacted D-Link & Dell. I have tried cards, and USB ports from Dell and still can not get the wireless and my computer to connect. I give up. I am going to attempt to return the DIR-655 back to Amazon for credit."
4,Just what I needed,"I decided to upgrade to a 802.11n gigabit network. I'm actually using this router as a wired router merely because I had an extra 802.11n router that I use as an access point in my tv room where we mostly use our laptop to get a stronger signal. However, when I did use the DIR-655 for my wireless, I got a very good signal from the basement, but the access point is even stronger. I was mostly shooting to upgrade to gigabit because I do a lot of file transfers between devices on my network.The DIR-655 does its work very well, although I would have liked an even stronger signal.The best part for me is the ability to reserve local ip addresses to specific devices through DHCP. Understand I used to use a Linksys 54g router and Linksys, for some reason, doesn't allow for this. It was especially important because my ReplayTV devices need fixed IP address for workable port forwarding. Static IP's are a real annoyance.Overall, I am very happy with this router."
1,Does Not Work,"This on the surface seems like a great product. Unfortunately, had a ton of difficulty getting it to install on my computer. There is a new firmware version out (1.31), but it comes out in .bin format and is a pain to get to work. Their support staff is very friendly and understanding, but I didn't want to any more hours trying to get this product to work. I will look for a better router. I am also wondering if having Verizon Online DSL has anything to do with it."
2,The router that aspires to be a paperweight.,"Bought this based on the good reviews and the bad reviews of other routers. The range of this router is pathetic compared to the range of the Linksys G it replaced. The speed is fine with a bunch of manual tweaks. Even with the tweaks it's not good enough to rave about, not crappy enough to return. Until today.Forty seven days after purchase (with one or two drop offs in between that time) the router stops working. So, I do what I've done for years -- unplug it, wait 20-30 seconds, plug it back in. Once plugged back in...nothing. No power light. No buzzing. Nothing. I now have, in essence, a $94 brick that is 17 days beyond Amazon's 30 day return policy.This router is mediocre when it works and if my experience is any indication, is nothing more than a paperweight in training. I'm buying local for the next one, which will probably be the much maligned Linksys N. D-Link had their chance and failed miserably."
2,Works on everything except my my Lenovo H320 Desktop,"After reading all the superlative reviews on this product, I bought not 1 but 2 of these routers for 2 offices. Little did I know that no matter what type of settings I tried, the Dlink D-655 would fail to connect with my primary computer, a Lenovo H320 with a gigabit network card and an i5 processor. It's not a problem with just one Dlink DIR 655 router since BOTH routers would not connect to my Lenovo computer, but the DIR655 had no problems with my older XP machines. Specifically the router could not see the computer, much less connect to the LAN or internet. One could blame the Lenovo for not connecting to the Dlink but it connected to a Netgear router without a hitch. Otherwise seems to work fine but the range is not as wide as my previous Medialink router, which failed after just 6 months, and should be avoided at all cost even though it too has a very high rating. Goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover, or ratings in this case."
2,unnoticeable power,I bought this router because my old netgear router was starting to loose range. This router claims to have very good range so when I hooked it up and got it going it was just as or less powerful then my netgear router. And the range was the same and the internet speed was slower. If your looking for a router for a small one story house then this is the router for you. Dont expect it to cover a two story house or anything bigger then that.
1,Worst router ever - very poor coverage - drops all the time,"this is the worst router ever, coverage was very poor, very dificult to set updo not waste your money!returned after just 1 day"
2,Slow wireless speeds no matter what I do,"I have 3 802.11n computers that I use with this router. Whenever I stream either a 600mb movie or a DVD rip the video skips due to slow transfer speeds. All of my computers are newer and have updated firmware. My router has updated firmware as well. I know enough about computers / networks to troubleshoot. I know not to use TKIP etc. Ive tried changing options and settings but my video would always skip. I bought an Asus N12 router to flash with WW-DRT and use as a wireless repeater for my 360 across the house. One day I decided to swap routers so I unplugged my 655 and threw the N12 in its place and BAM!, amazing streaming capabilities.The $39 Asus is a ton faster then the 655. I'm not here to promote the Asus but it was the only basis of comparison that I have.The point of my review is to warn you about my experience and let you know that there are better options out there for less money.Do you research and save some coin."
5,Love this router!,I *always* recommend this router to anyone that I can. It has been extremely reliable and is very fast. It also has terrific wireless range as well. I love having a gigabit home network (especially when transferring a lot of movies and pictures). Don't think twice - get this router.
1,Do not buy this,"I was warned by friends not to buy D Link because it has frequent service interruptions but I ignored their advice. I found a good deal and decided to buy it, figuring it could not possibly be worse than the Linksys router my parents suffered with for years.Boy was I wrong. Literally not a day has gone by where I did not have to reset the router. Its been a month and I have to reset it every single day and if I am home all day on a computer then often I'll have to reset 2 or 3 times. What a colossal waste of money. I am currently returning this item and going to get a more trustworthy brand."
3,Great While it Lasted,"This router was a great one that I had for a long time, but after a couple years it just stopped working and I couldn't use it anymore. While it was working though, it output a very strong signal and was very fast. It was also very easy to configure and was just a pleasure to use. Worth the money and served me well. Other than the fact it stopped working, this was a great router."
3,Works fine before dead,"Bought this router about two years ago. It has been worked fine until recently drops the connection from time to time. Dead completely yesterday. Coverage is OK, while my cell and pad still have bars behind 3-4 walls (about 50 feet away)."
3,"Everything about it was great, then it died","Everything about this router was great. Performance, size, setup. The menus are really easy to use. Has a great form-factor. Then after 3 months of use being solid as a rock, it locked up once needing to be rebooted - then a day later, it went totally bonkers. I sent it back to Amazon (returns after 30 days are not very simple) and got a Netgear N900 - better, but costs over twice as much. Was mine just a lemon or does this line have a high failure rate? Who knows. The DIR-655 a great value if you can get it to hang with you."
2,perfect... when it works,"I picked up this router 6 days ago and got everything working. the quick and easy setup disk worked like a charm and everything went fine for about a week. on the 6th day of running it decided to reset itself over and over again until i unplugged it for a couple hours. after plugging everything back in the router would turn on but wouldnt connect to my computer via wire or wireless so i called tech support. im not a dummy when it comes to electronics i work as a tech guy selling and fixing everything from laptops to remote controls. the lady i talked to (sharque is how she pronounced her name) was not fluent in english at all, and she didnt understand what the word reset meant... im giving this router a 2 out of 5 simply becuase it works occasinally and thats too much to give personally."
3,"Cumbersome & Difficult Install, Otherwise 5 Star Operation","The install CD wouldn't work correctly, so I opted for the manual install with incomplete instructions enclosed with the unit. Still had to call manufacturer CS to get the configuration corrected and get the 2.03 Firmware update - over all took a few hours. Manufacturer CS fine, but their website log in authetication code was a tad difficult to crack as it wasn't simple aplhas and numerics, some symbols were squares [not a O or zero] or backward Es [not a 3]. Thus I knocked a couple of stars off for this cumbersome install.After installation complete and placement of unit ensured a clear path to wifi devices, the unit seems to be working perfectly fine worthly of 5 stars after 3 days use."
2,Poor Range - USB interface doesn't work for hard drives,"Pros:Hardwired connects worked well, including my Obi110, for VoIP with Google voice.Cons:The signal strength was the poorest of any wireless router I've ever used. I like to set up a work desk in my yard on good weather days, so signal strength is important. When going to other rooms in my home, 2-4 neighbors had higher signal than the D-Link 615.Just 10 feet out my front door (about 30 feet from the router with 2 walls), I lost signal. By contrast my cheap $20 router has signal strength for another 100' (but, the cheap one is becoming intermittent so need a more reliable one).One selling/justification point of this unit was the USB interface, presumably to allow a shared external drive. I could not get my PC or Mac to connect.Returned the item after 2 days."
2,Meh,"I took a chance but shouldn't have. Speed was good, when wireless worked. Had good uptime for a few weeks then had to start powering down/up almost daily. No firmware update to try and fix it. Sent it back. Bought a Buffalo."
4,AAA+ Router,"I have had this router for over a month and have had ""0""drop outs in that time. The range is not all that great,but is probably due to the configuration of my home.I cant seemto get more than 2 bars whereas my clunky blue Linksys gaveme a consistent 3 bars. I purchased and installed the Amped 150repeater and now can get full bars on my laptop across the street.However,the Amped installs as another network but the range isfantastic. Iam very pleased with this router as it has given me noproblems except for the poor range."
5,Great router upgrade,"Great replacement for my failing wireless router. I have not gotten too into the nitty gritty regarding shareport or advanced setups, but it spits that magical wireless signal to my devices without issue.Easy to setup out of the box. Easy to use setup web page to check and alter settings.Upgrading the firmware unfortunately lost most of my settings, which was more of a hassle than an issue as I had fully set everything up prior to updating the firmware.No issues with wireless or wired connections in about a month of use now."
1,A really fast (rebooting) router,"I went with this router due to my past experience with D-Link. I hooked up the router, made quick work of the configuration and was up and running in no time. The only problem is that it would NEVER stay up. I called D-Link numerous times and received numerous different excuses and ways of fixing the issue. I tried them all without luck and finally had to return it to Amazon. The issues seems to be a problem with heat, but I even put a fan on it with no good results. The router either rebooted/restarted every hour or so or it just went off line.Thanks to Amazon's great customer support for letting me return it and get something else that actually works."
2,Not reliable..frequent disconnects,"Finally had to buy a Linksys N router to replace this one. Have a dell desktop and a sony laptop, and was experiencing frequent disconnects every day. Searched the internet and played around with lots of admin settings, but it didn't fix the issue. Found similar issues all over the internet for this model. I am surprised as to how did this model get such good reviews at the 1st place (avg. 4 stars). Didn't bother calling customer support as I read very bad reviews about it too. Bought a linksys N router, and haven't got a single issue till then. It's been more than 2 weeks now, and not a single disconnect so far. Very happy with it. Overall my experience with linksys has been better than dlink."
2,Not good enough,I was replacing my linksys wireless-g because it would reset too often. I disliked D-link for 2 big reasons: (1) The wifi signal would disappear and only a hard on/off would make it work. Exploring forums showed many folks have the same issue. I also reviewed the router logs and there were definitely internal software issues with the router. (2) Each save of a setting required a 20s router reboot which makes it very tedious to administer. I have returned the router and gone back to my linksys until I can find something more suitable and usable.
2,Should have paid attention to the bad reviews.,"I should have listened more closely to the bad reviews regarding reception. The wireless function to all my household laptops was terrible, dropping out and not being able to hook up to the router about every half hour. I liked all the features but this issue made it impossible to keep."
2,Terrible Product,"This router was recommended to me by a friend, and since it had almost 2,000 reviews with a 4-star average, I decided to give it a try...WORST ROUTER EVER. I have had nothing but problems since I first set it up. As a Mac user, the manual set-up is a little more difficult, but it's still relatively easy, so that was initially encouraging. Ever since then, my roommate and I have had to reset it at least twice a day (there are absolutely no problems with the internet connection). Although it works very well, it needs to be reset so often that it's not worth it. Do not buy this product!"
5,Great Router!,"This is a great router that I connected to the modem from time warner.Signal is very stable and it really reaches far. Connection is stable and data transmission is faster compared to my old router. I encountered some problems installing it since a previous router is still connected to my PC. After turning the old router off, installation went by easy.I'm very satisfied with this router and highly recommend it."
5,Loved it,Loved it. Works great and has a very good range and signal strength. Other reviews stated that the unit heated up - this is not the case with the unit I received.
1,Poor insructions and/or defective unit,"This item was returned as unusable. After many hours of attempting setup finally gave up. (I have set up several routers previously, with no problems.) Just set up a Trendnet similar router in about 20 minutes with no problems and it works perfectly!"
3,Range is not much,I bought this wireless router to extend the WiFi service to the edge of my property (1/2 Acre. Even with 3 6dB antennas I couldn't get the router to transmit over 50 feet. I consider myself a little bit savvy with electronics so now I'm looking options on how to extend the signal. Other than that is was quite easy to setup and I like the security features and the web interface. I'm not giving up on the purchase because the streaming of video was important to me over 802.11n. BTW back end is attached to Comcast Cable modem service
1,Very upset from Amazon,"I don't like to buy an item then in less than a week the price drops and I don't get compensated!!!The device is still brand new in its original package, very bad policy!!!"
1,D-Link 655,I am very disappointed in the range of this wireless product. My old router (G) had a much better range and speed.
1,D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router,Piece of junk... Poor range .... Could get only one of my three laptops to connect.. Returned it ....
3,"Easy set-up, Seems really fast","I'll weigh in on the positive side for this unit. It's been on all day and is cool to the touch, so no problem there. I replaced an existing netgear G router and it's noticeably faster. Used the standard interface (192.168.0.1) to configure. I'm not particularly technical but had no problems.Just got it today, but it seems to be working fine. It arrived with the 1.32NA firmware already installed, so I was prepared for some of the problems that have been reported, but so far, so good.1/21/2010 update: Range isn't any better than my old G router. The Shareport feature is undependable. Sometimes it connects to a drive I attached, sometimes not, wireless isn't any better. Claims WPA2 but I haven't been able to access it yet."
5,Great router. I am pleased.,I've purchased this router because of good review. The router is easy to setup. The speed and coverage are great. I'm pleased.
3,Compared to netgear rangemax....,"The amazon order/shipping experience was excellent as always.I ordered this router to replace a 2yo rangemax that had suddenly started randomly losing connections, which i've since learned is a commonly noted problem with rangemax.However, for a specific case of connecting with a wireless xbox 40' away with 802.11g and through 5 layers of walls and a floor, the signal strength is poor compared to the rangemax which is average according to the strength bars noted on the xbox, and sometimes drops altogether. I'm exchanging for another rangemax that will hopefully last another 2 years.The dir-655 may for many people be the perfect solution, but for me it is not."
4,Works great and does what you expect,the signal is definitely strong and reliable. I have many wireless in the area and I haven't had any drop or lose of signal.I did have occasionally some of those issues with the previous model DIR-615.If you have FIOS it will not work in AUTO mode (10/100/1000) out of the box and mostly it's a Verizon issue.I had to deal for a few days on the phone to convince Verizon that the issue was on their side and internet isfull of people reporting the same issue. That's the only mini snafu that I noticed for everything else it's a goodunit and I'm happy about it.
1,D-Link is a HORRIBLE company,"Bought the DIR-655 brand new and had to return it to D-Link 3 times before I received a unit that actually worked. All of the dysfunctional units put themselves into an endless loop of reboot, rendering the unit dysfunctional. This generally occurred after working for 4-5 hours. After leaving the product unplugged for a couple of hours, you'd be able to get another 4-5 hours of use before having to repeat the unplug cycle. Compounding that problem...D-LINK CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST EVER!!! My combined total time spent on hold with D-Link was well over 4 hours. You talk with someone briefly (generally to retell your situation for the umteenth time because they are too lazy to look at the problem ticket), then off to transfer land where you get another prolonged hold time before you reach the next incompetent technician. AVOID D-LINK...they are horrible!!!!!!"
1,"Horrible, incredibly hard and confusing setup","I've had a lot of linksys routers and netgear routers which were basically plug and play, so to speak. No hassele setups. So when I heard about all the positives on this router I decided to upgrade. Big mistake! Out of the box, this router did not work at all with my desktop comupter; it was broadcasting a wireless connection for my laptop, but my desktop's connection was completely dead. After numerous hours of trying to tweak it by both CD install, and both manual installs and checking the Dlink site by rehooking my old router back up, I gave up.As other reviews note, initial setup can be tricky for this router. I've had lots of routers in the past and none of them required the amount of tweaking I had to go through and even then, it still didn't work correctly. Save yourself a big headache and get something else."
1,Doesn't work - even messes up my wired network,"I bought this router to add to my in-house wired network. Not only was the wireless unreliable (slow then fast, then nothing) it caused my wired connections to not work correctly. Same issues.Sending it back and going to try something else. After reading how bad D-links tech support is and being very familiar with networks I'm not even going to bother trying to figure it out."
5,Excellent Working Order. Good and Prompt service.,"It took me a while to get the product software downloaded and the product up and running. The cable company service I have is not that great, so I could have used a little more help in the step by step instructions on how to get the software downloaded."
3,"Other than microwave interference, I am happy with it",I have used it for a year. It is reliable and the signal reaches the whole house when it is placed in the middle of the house from the ceiling. The setup was straightforward. I have a problem with interference from my microwave. I have to connect directly to the router when it is running.
1,Beware of D-Link,"D-Link has the worst customer service and RMA practices in the business.This is the second D-Link Router that has failed with in 6 months. I would recommend you keep everything because when you have to RMA this router back to D-Link they want everything back. Including the worthless outdated CD, which they think is worth $12.00. Plus you need to pay for the shipping of the defective product. Then they have auduactiy to ship you back a USED router! The one i received was dusty, grimmy, and scratched. So essentially I have paid 150.00 for a USED router."
4,Couldn't be happier,"I'm a computer user - not a programmer or hardware guy. I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of setup, and with the network speed. It's not the cheapest router you can buy, but not having to spend time figuring out how to get it to work was worth a little more."
5,Perfect Match for Vista 64-bit,The D-Link DIR-655 router solved all my wireless problems with Windows Vista 64-bit. I get high internet speeds (throughput) and reliability is awesome. I paired up this router with the D-Link DWA-556 adapter card.The initial router setup was not ideal (the setup CD is pretty worthless). But I called D-Link Tech Support and was up and running in minutes.I love this router for Vista 64-bit.
4,D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router,"Great value for money. Does everything a regular household needs out of a wireless router. I couldn't get the USB port to share the printer which was annoying. Any setup instructions online just didn't answer the question. I didn't have time to call tech support so I am not sure how they would have handled that.Good product, good price, can't go wrong for what it is worth!"
2,"Happy with this product, in the beginning.....","This is the first wireless router I have purchased and Im pretty content on how fast it is, I get the same speeds(when Im close the the router of course) as if I had the cable connected. Also subpar speeds when in farther away in other rooms. At the start it stopped giving off a signal on its own, don't know what the cause of it was but it seems to be working fine now.*****01/08/2011 Update****Well I dropped the stars down to 2, it works well for a few hours then seems to drop connection which I have to hard reset the modem in order for it to get the connection again. I've read a few forums and it seems people with this product has the same problem with no solution. I really wish D-Link would address this problem."
4,Good Product,"Installed this device about a week ago and had it up and running in about 20 minutes. Easy to configure and has a large number of features. I especially like that you can configure a wireless Guest Zone for some of the very old devices I have around the house.The one downside, and its minor, is that there is no client tool to allow you to easily map the network. Linksys has a very nice support tool that comes free."
1,Hot item...but not all that hot!,"As a previous reviewer pointed out, this thing gets way too hot. How can anything be dependable over the long haul when it gets hot and stays hot? Then the other day, when the signal began dropping several times a day, out of the blue I'd had enough. Speed was nothing to write home about either. If you are unhappy with your purchase be sure to send it back before the window of time expires to return it."
1,Would not connect to the Internet (DHCP),"After many days of trying, I sent it back. Even their technical suppport couldn't correct it. My old router was able to connect without any fuss. However, the return to Amazon was easy."
2,Large home wifi coverage my eye!,"This router is advertised at the D-Link site to cover large homes, up to 10,000 square feet I think. I have 2800 square feet and the coverage was lousy with a dsl modem connected to the 655. I even tried replacing the antennae on the router with some high gain 9bi antennae, which improved the coverage only marginally. The router was fairly easy to setup using the setup disc. There is the possibility that the problem, however, was not with the router but with my dsl signal. I finally gave up and ordered Roadrunner. With Time Warner's recent push on low introductory rates and the fact that I was paying over $35 for dsl, I switched to cable internet with a faster connection and a lower price--at least for the first year."
4,"A very good, fast router","If you find that you are having a problem with the D-Link DIR-655 router habitually dropping your internet connection, try this: Log onto your router settings page, then click SETUP, then click WIRELESS SETTINGS, finally skip to the bottom of the page and click MANUAL INTERNET CONNECTION SETUP. Once there, un-check the box labeled ""Enable Auto Channel Scan."" Now drop down to WIRELESS CHANNEL, and manually select a channel. (I would recommend first trying either channel 10 or 11). Then SAVE SETTINGS."
1,failed after less than 1 year,This router failed after less than one year. It also did not live up to it's long range/high speed claims.
2,Have to reboot too often,"It's amazing that a lot of routers have equal amounts of great and bad reviews..makes it hard to figure out which one is really good. From my experience, this router has been a dud. It needs to be rebooted frequently, and the signal gets weak only 40 feet away. Also our xbox only gets a strong signal once in a while. It has been incredibly frustrating, mostly the rebooting. I am going to write off this investment and buy a netgear."
2,Radio Keeps Shutting Off,"I've had positive experiences with DLink and Amazon recommended items. The DIR-655 has great reviews and a bucket load of features (including ones I'm never likely to leverage). The most important thing, however, would be for the product to work and work simply.Periodically, the wireless radio will turn off. This is guaranteed proximate to power down / up (e.g. vacations). But happens less frequently without obvious associated event. Secure, yes. Intended use case, no.Unfortunately, there is no ""turn radio on"" toggle via the management interface. So, I could follow DLink advice and re-accomplish the wireless setup wizard from a directly connected workstation. Or, I could wait until the mood strikes, and the radio is restored. In fairness, this creates about a 10-20% downtime scenario. And, I'm sure my perception is inflated from reality. So, I'd recommend that you pick a similarly rated, but alternate product."
1,Just Say No,"I have set up multiple wireless routers before this one and cannot get this to connect to the internet. Nothing I tried worked. After multiple attempts and hours of frustration, I've put this item back in the box and will probably throw it away. Don't waste your money. Just say ""NO"" to all of the hype. Stick with Linksys!!"
2,Line of sight reception only,"I don't know how far the wireless routers are supposed to work, but this one only works a few feet. Certainly not in another room."
4,It has long range,"Tough time hooking it up, had to call tech support. It works fine after getting some help. Has a long range."
1,Waste of money,"I have used a D-Ling router for years and decided to upgrade to this ""N"" router. After 10+ hours on their support line speaking with about 6 different techs I was finally told it was a defective router and it should be returned for a replacement. I recieved the same router back. It still did not work. I am very familiar with setting up wireless routers. I contacted the D-Link a second time but did not get a response. This router was a waste of money."
1,Kills my computer,"I got the router working without significant problems. However, I bought it on the promise that I could plug in a hard drive to the USB and share it with computers on my network. Turns out it doesn't expose a share -- you have to install d-link's ""network usb utility"" on each computer that will see the drive. I installed this, and immediately got a blue screen of death on my vista machine. Rebooting just led to more kernel failures. I couldn't uninstall in safe mode, and there was no configuration option to turn it off. Eventually, I was able to unplug the network and reboot successfully, and after trying to uninstall from a full reboot I got...another blue screen of death. Router may work fine, but this feature is a dud."
1,not good,"I had this for one week and had to return it immediately. The wireless connection was inconsistent and unreliable and one of my computers couldn't connect to it at all. But worse, the ethernet router was frequently dropping out and needing to be reset. When you're playing poker online that's not what you want out of a router. I'd say skip this and wait for them to make a better router. Ironically I also bought the d-link 5 port gigabit switch and that works flawlessly. Stay away from this one."
2,"Easy setup, great parental control features BUT ...","I purchased this router because it was well rated by CNET and other review sites, but had to return it because it did not function well.Plus: easy setup, great parental controls, fairly good wireless coverageMinus: both the wired and wireless connections dropped intermittenly. D-Link technical support could not fix, either through firmware update, configuration changes or with a replacement router.I truly wished it worked because I liked the features it presents, but I need a reliable router as I am a telecommuter."
5,Great Router don't consider Linksys,My second Dlink. The first is still running after 14 months not a single reset. I love these things. My IPAD works on my entire 1 acre property. Also UPnp works great with Windows Home Server.
2,Worked ok at first...,"I purchased this on October 5, 2009--little issue getting it set up, but no biggie. However, woke up this morning with no wireless internet. I reset to factory settings 7 times and changed the network names, passwords, ect to no avail. Even took my Mac to the local Mac Store, and it had no problems with their network.No matter what I have done, I cannot get this thing to work. So, while the speed was good, and I had no other issues for the past three months-it just quit working. I am so unhappy given the amount I spent on this product!"
1,A self-reboot/frozen router,"This router is a good fit for general purpose as long as you:- Don't upgrade the firmware- Don't have a high traffic- Don't use the built-in USB featureWe upgraded the firmware because we needed to use the built-in USB feature, and the nightmare began:- The router is frozen and required reboot, few times a day.- The router will reboot itself if the traffic is high (e.g., several GB in an hour).- The USB feature didn't work, even we upgraded the firmware.Since we don't need to wireless feature, we ended up replacing it by Cisco RSV4000."
3,OK router,"Bought this router as a replacement for a Linksys router that I thought was going bad. Overall the router worked immediately, which is always a good thing! QOS controls in the firmware I found to be a bit lacking .. seemed to have a lot of adjustment options in firmware, but not as nicely organized or easy to understand as the Linksys admin page.Performance of router was just OK - with the 3 movable antennas - I expected to get a much better signal than the Linksys router, which I did not .. even with the router being 20 feet away with no walls - still only got an 80% signal. Linksys even got a bit better.Could not get router to work at all with my Slingbox, despite instructions found online. Just can't get it to communicate, which is frustrating. Spent a couple of hours on it and nothing, even after performing the necessary port openings and whatnot."
1,BEWARE! PIECE OF JUNK!!!,"D-Link router sort of worked for awhile; I would have to reset it once a week or more, then finally quit altogether. Tech support doesnt exist and boy you better not lose your receipt if you'd like them to tell you even the time of day."
1,A disappointment,"Replaced a 5 year old wireless router with this with the promise of improved performance. Mac(OS-X) and PC (XP)environment.This new router was slower by far, dropped connections, had much less range, weak signal, and customer/technical support (I think from Somalia) was a travesty. Same problems on both the Mac and PC.Reinstalled my old one and am back up and running with no issues."
3,It's Okay,Not as powerfull as I had hoped. Easy set up just like my previous D-Link. Good speeds. No lag time but had to add a booster to get coverage thru out the house.
5,Great performance for the money,"We notice much faster connection with the wireless connection with our laptop. Also, the wired connections seem faster as well. What more do you want?"
1,Wont work with remote desktop,"After 10 hours of fussing I sent it back. Dlinks cust service blows. Everything worked except remote desktop, which one might think was a problem in the chair and not the router. But many many forums showed the same issue and no fix in sight."
1,Worst dlink product I have used,"Have been using this router for the last 2 months or so. I have already returned one unit for replacement, which cost me $15 in shipping under warranty because dlink does not cover me shipping the unit to them (didn't know this!). second unit is still just as unreliable. reception is not any better than my older g router. wireless connection is laggy and slow. lose connection every so often. customer service is horrible (they claimed that these are happening due to my ISP yet I had been using the same ISP w the old router w no problems). so far I am sorry that I have upgraded to n. stay away from this router."
3,Still in a process.,"There are some concerns, need more time to findout.Installation process is not easy as advertised, considering set up all devices: printer, VOIP adapter, etc."
1,GARBAGE,"I bought this router from amazon, due to its positive reviews. The first one arrived DOA, with dlink offering minimal phone support. The second one has been functioning......like garbage.I have a 900 sq ft loft (meaning that its pretty much open), and I lose wifi reception 30 feet away. The power socket on the back has to be taped to the router in a certain way in order for it to power the device, and it needs to be reset on the reg.This was my first kind of expensive router, and I am really disappointed. I had a $20 netgear that worked much better.Oh and if you want to plug a hard dive in this router......its a colossal pain. You have to pair the devise that you want to access the HD with, and then when you are finished, you have to un-pair it. If you don't un-pair it, you wont be able to access the HD with any other devises."
5,D-Link DIR-655 N+300 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router,"Great product. Looks good, and doesn't take up much space. Can handle several laptops, a desktop at once along with an I pad. Delivers as expected. Would recommend this."
3,comment on customer service,"I have only had this up and running for 2 days now. Seems to be working fine. I have a two story house and I get connections in any room. I was Online for about 4 hrs with no interruption. Hook up was awfull!!! called d-link tech. support 4 times with the same answer from everyone and they didn't seem to care that everyone was telling me to unplug wait hook back up etc etc .......was not working. The language problem with each person was not fun!! Finally I hung up and sent an email so that english wasn't a problem anymore and got an answer. I was on the phone with this company from 7 to 12 that night. One simple problem, the email instructions said that I needed to change my IP address on the router because my dsl provider (shentel) was using the same IP address and that is why i could not get a connection! I would not recommend if you are not an IT person and may need help with hook up do not get anything through d-link because the tech support is really bad!!!!!!"
5,D-Link Dir-655,"This has been a great Router, it was very easy to set up and has worked perfectly. I had problems with my previous Router, trouble connecting & continously going off line. The only time it worked well was if I had no security & ran an open line. This Router has worked awesome with the security features and never drops off line. I recieve a very strong signal throughout the whole house. Would definately recommend this product."
4,So far so good,"After my DLINK DI-614+ router died after 5 years, I bought my new router for a couple bucks less at Costco. Costco package offered a 24/7 customer support number. Since my router and internet connection were down I couldn't use installation wizard. I was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup. Haven't setup any advanced features, but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router. So far so good. If I get a chance to setup and confirm advanced features I'll come back to update review/rating. It works, good customer service (so far) = 4 stars."
5,Very reliable - By far the best router I ever purchased.,"I had this router a little over 6 months. I bought it mainly based on the good reviews found here on Amazon website. It exceeds my expectations. The wireless signal is very strong. I have the router in my basement and I get the signal everywhere through out the house, the back yard, front yard and I bet my neighbor sees the signal too (BTW, it's secured). The router has been on 24/7 for over 6 months I I haven't had to reset it once. My last Trendnet and Linksys routers needed a reset every few weeks or they refused to connect wirelessly.I highly recommend this router to anyone who wants a reliable gigabit and wireless-N router. It obviously one of the best product in its class."
4,DIE-655 Is a robust router,"Fairly easy to setup although the new plethora of options and some minor changes to older model setup is somewhat different. The first machine was the easiest to add while the second and third were a bit more confusing since different OSs would not accept the autogen security key which I had to figure out how to change.Once setup it has worked flawlessly for me using 3 ports continuously, 2 wired and 1 wireless under heavy load. Additionally the uPNP port forwarding required by many newer programs seems to be supported and working flawlessly as well."
1,wastes your time and money.,Pros: Nice lookingCons:Same coverage with my old linksys G band router. Unexpected disconnect with internet 2 or 3 times a day which my old linksys router never did. I was expecting it to be way better than my old one. This router is useless. I had to return it.
2,Don't Bother there are better routers out there,Router works OK not great. Have to either restart or diagnose problem to reconnect everytime I use it and the laptop is only 5 feet away from router. Will keep it only because its here but will not recommend. Get a better one than this if you want to enjoy your router's performance.
2,Poor Installation,"You can NOT easily upgrade an existing wireless network with this router, nor is it easy to start a brand new network. First off, it REQUIRES an internet connection to run the installation program. Next, it REQUIRES that you hardwire the router to a PC.If you can not do both of the above, then steer clear of this one."
5,was rated as best router,works great. easy to setup.but configuring some settings were a little confusing.like setting the password for wireless signal.this is rated as one of the best routers.
3,Works ok ... not easy to use,"works ok, but isn't very easy to use ... all the screen settings are embedded so you have to search and tab and search. Annoying.why they just couldn't put all the wireless settings under ""wireless"" and all the ""port"" settings under port, i don't know.the instructions tell you what something is BUT NOT WHERE to find it.the Wireless doesn't rate as fast as my linksys either.solid product, but definitely not user friendly imo"
2,not happy with the unit,I had the D-Link DIR-615 and once installed DIR-655 didn't noticed any difference. Speed did not increase neither did the range of the wireless reception.
4,Router has only marginally better range,It is a good router and works well. I had a new Netgear router that was the new dual band and the range was poor. Just about 40' away in another room and I only had half signal. I switched to this one and get better signal but it still does not reach much beyond my building. My house is only 150' from my business so I would like to be able to use just one internet plan.
1,Tech Support didnt Make the Cut !!!!!,"the product was great but the WiFi would not connect tech support was a total waste they just told me to send it back which I did.the death of home technology products is tech support this is the biggest issue technology faces today there has to be a better way. dont buy this prodcut and maybe the company will make an effort to provide good support so little problems like this dont become huge ones. I will never use d-link again,that is the moral of this story."
1,"Complete garbage, and expensive to boot!","Had this router for a while and it's been a constant headache. It randomly drops the internet connection and then reconnects. Not a big deal if you're just checking your email, but if you're trying to upload/download anything, forget it! At first I was led to believe it was due to too many simultaneous connections overloading it (though I never quite believed that) Now I can't do anything with a file over about 2mb even when it's the only thing running and no other devices are connected to the network. Trying to upload files for a website or stream files is useless since it's constantly crapping out. I've ended up skipping the router altogether when I want to get any real work done. Fortunately my modem is in the same room as my computer so I can just plug it straight in. Worst $150 I've ever spent on a computer product."
4,almost perfect,"Everything is fine. The signal strength is very good, the coverage is very wide, the feature is nice to have. The problem is only one, that is they do not have feature that allow me to set up the mac filter only for cable connection and or only for wireless connection. For example if I want to set up my wireless network to be more secure by filtering the mac address and allow any connection from the cable connection, it will not work."
5,A Turkey can set this up !!!,*Ease of setup 5 out of 5 stars*Reliability 5 out of 5 stars*Speed 5 out of 5 stars*Range*Over Heating= NONEI recommend this router to anyone. This is a very powerful router!!!
1,D-LINK D-STINK,"I had an expert install this unit replacing a well known router. We tried it out sitting just 5 feet away to see if it would work, all I got was a FAIR reception, worse than what I had. HORRIBLE"
1,Don't buy it - it will make you cry,"After one year of owning this router, it has gone from OK to finicky to unusable. I now get a spontaneous DHCP release several times a day. I have updated the firmware, turned off any options possible, read all the forum posts and made sure the thing is not overheating. I originally bought it because it supported an external antenna and the reviews were generally decent, but I am about to buy another router just to preserve my sanity. Fly, you fools. Save yourselves."
3,Bit of a wait in getting,"Bit of wait to receive it but when it arrived everything went fine. Excellect CD set up and installation, very easy. Works great."
1,junk,"I bought this based upon several reviews that I read. Don't believe anything positive. This device functioned @ 1/4 of the speed of my previous WAP. Old was 54Mbps this was running @ 11mbps, wirelessy & wired. The web based interface has more adjustments that a Cisco router. Don't waste your money with it. I'm returning it & anxiously await my refund."
1,Definitely not pleased with item,"I was very disappointed with this product. I had a hard time getting to work. When I called support, no real attempt was made to help me. Finally, I returned the product and purchased a Belkin N1 Vision Wireless Router. I am glad I made that decision.Bob"
3,Not any faster than wireless G...yet,"I must say that the product worked right out of the box, once properly set up. The speeds howevewr are not any better than wirelss G. I have a DSL set up with a new notebook rated for high speeds. My measured land line connection is at about 86M. The best I can get on my notebook is 54M. I spoke to both Verizon and DLink customer service, and did all of their checks, and programming. Still no faster.Thust the 3 star rating. If speeds were as reported, would be a 5."
1,"""Xtreme"" stands for XTREME FRUSTRATION if you are a Apple/Mac user","Although this router says it is Macintosh compatible, don't expect any help from D-Link's User Manual nor website for set up on a Mac.The only thing on their website regarding the Mac is the OS it needs to be higher than, and to see pages 10-14 of the 93 page user manual. Page 10 basically says to skip to page 14 if you are not using the (Windows Only) CD for set up, and when you get to page 14 it tells you what to type in the window that the CD brought up, which you can't see.What a waste of time, money and accumulated frustration! I suggest they quit saying Macintosh Compatible until they give some instructions for Mac users.Come on D-Link. . . . put a few instructions somewhere for Mac users! In my book, you rate your name 'D'-link, far from getting an 'A'-link. You can make a CD and a 93 page manual for PC users, but not any instructions at all for Mac users? Shame on you!"
5,Four years strong!,"i was checking out new products and came across the 655 that i bought four years ago and had to write a review. if you're considering this model, it has worked nearly flawlessly connecting 3 laptops, a wireless printer, a cabled NAS, and two cabled desktops (the only exception is when i need to reboot it maybe 2 or 3 times a year -- it's really rare to do that). not strong enough for multilevel homes with coverage in all its corners but few routers are. within its normal range it's nothing but fast and excellent and accepts firmware updates with no problems. a really super product."
2,Router is not very good,"I'm surprised at all the good reviews on this router. Unfortunetely I bought it because of the good reviews, but it's going back to Fry's next week.My 8 year old Netgear FVM318 router's wireless speed is 100 to 200% faster then the DIR-655 router, and the latency is consistenly 33% better! The wifi reception on the DIR-655 is only slightly better, but, the wifi connectivity drops from time to time, which never happened with my Netgear router. I'm really wondering why this router has all these great reviews, because I don't recommend it. I'm going to try another Netgear router."
1,Locks up from time to time,"This product has a decent price and a good feature set. Most everything else is pretty much average.The main problem is that it locks up under heavy use. If I just use it for light web browsing and occasional network file transfer, it's okay. But if I try to download a huge service pack, use it for torrents, or watch a lot of Netflix streaming, it locks up completely. When it's locked up, networked computers cannot access each other and nothing can access the Internet. About 3-4 times a week I have to power cycle the router in order to fix this problem.All the neat features and speed don't matter if the thing is locked up. I have owned this unit for years now and none of the firmware updates have solved the problem. I finally gave up and got a different router."
2,Good when it works,"It is a very nice router when it wants to work. I have been on the phone with D-Link 4 times trying to find out why the router randomly stops working, but they just keep messing with the settings insisting it is not the router. I have had the cable company out 3 times and they guarantee me that it is not the internet. I have upgraded the firmware, portforwarded and done everything i could possibly do, but every other day i have to come home and pull the power plug to the router, wait for it to reboot then get on the internet. After working all day and spending 80 bucks on a router, I really do not think I should have to do this. I would go with something else if you are looking to spend the money. I had a netgear before and it never had this many problems."
1,worthless product,"I bought this router to extend the range of the wireless network within my house. It was a failure. The range was no greater than that of my old router. In addition, it frequently dropped the wireless connection while the wired connection remained good. The wireless connection could only be restored by rebooting the router. I sent it back and obtained another identical router. It had identical problems. Possibly Amazon had a defective batch of these routers. They were highly recommended by the person who set up my network."
3,Needs improvement on installation instructions,"The installation instruction CD/DVD has errors. D-Link, needs to test the instructions with a focus group so they can find out that it is missing key information. E.g. - It asked me to disconnect broadband modem but never did ask me to re-connect. I would have saved time and not think that I missed a step."
1,Randomly drops connections!,"This router is horribly unreliable! I replaced it with a Linksys, which hasn't had any problems. How does D-Link get away with selling this garbage?"
1,D-Link! D-Link! D-Link! Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!,"I am very satisfied with this product. Setup needs to be carefully followed if you have DSL, but otherwise the unit was straightforward to setup and performs extremely well. I replaced my WRT54g with this unit and WOW 802.11n has my vote for speed, consistency, and signal strength from the router. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. I paired it up with the DAP-1522 Bridge/Access Point for my home theater system. Killer combo!Update: CRAP!This unit turned out to be an expensive paper weight. Unit started bricking 2.5 weeks after purchase, and also was making my brand-new modem act wierd. I would stick to Linksys or NetGear. Something about these D-Link products just feel and look poorly thought out....I have a new NetGear Premium Edition router that has been bulletproof so far. We will see. I think I am done with D-Link. Sorry D-Boys!"
4,My Dlink,"Easy to set up. good value for the money. Try this one, I think you will like it! Recommended to me by a friend at work, he said if you need a good router than purchase this one it really performs well and I haven't had any problems with it. I haven't had any issues with this extreme d-link either. Get one, it won't be a mistake."
2,Great for a while,"I've had the unit for six months and the first five were great. The unit has great range and streaming video to my wireless blu-ray had no problems and overall good performance. BUT, just recently without any changes to the unit's setup I started getting drops on the wireless side, almost daily. This is real frustrating as the network just disappears from view and the only way to get is back is with a hard boot of the router. Hopefully, they will release a firmware fix or something soon, or I guess I've got a worthless unit!"
2,Unable to connect to internet,"After two hours trying to get it to work, I gave up and sent it back. The installation process is cumbersome and slow, and the software fell into a loop after I logged in, rebooting the router over and over. I tried using the wizard and I tried installing manually. Nothing worked. Using Windows 7, Comcast cable."
4,Almost got it right!,"Unfortunately D-Link has yet again crippled great hardware with poor firmware. The link-ablity, reliability, and performance is awesome! However, about every couple days I'll have to restart to get maximum performance out of the router. After waiting for a couple minutes it's back up and running perfectly. Highly recommended for bandwidth prioritization, gaming, and media streaming."
2,Cuts out!,"I noticed I had to reset the router every night. When it worked, it worked great! But when I install a router, I want to forget it's there. I returned it and bought a Belkin. We'll see how that goes."
4,Super for the price,"Does what a router is supposed to. Hasn't had too much trouble even with 5+ devices at a time. Good range. Neat look. But I wouldn't go so far as to call it ""EXTREME"". I reserve that word for backflips and couponing."
2,Frequent disconnects and reboots,"I have worked with networks for about 20 years, and have worked with just about every router brand out there. I was very optimistic about this product based on other user's reviews, but like MANY users have confirmed, this router can be extremely flaky. I tested with different firmware versions and various setting adjustments as recommended by other users experiencing the same problems, and it still disconnect and reboot itself at random and frequently. It only seem to be marginally stable when degrading or disabling security settings, which is totally unacceptable to me.Opening certain online games takes way too long, even if you are just playing online and not hosting. None of those games require opening any ports when not hosting. Downloading emails with attachments fails about 80% of the time and causes the router to reboot.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Returned Unit,Speed was terrible. No matter how much I tried to reconfigure the settings I couldn't get to function properly. Returned router within 2 weeks.
4,What a router!,"This really is a great router. Setup was a bit tricky with my system, but the tech-help was superb. The range is perfect, and I feel it's very secure."
5,Firmware still faulty with 2.0.0 in late 2011 - dns hangs,This router is fast but the firmware is both lacking and still has a dns relay bug. Dns relay is enabled by default. This means that the router gives out itself as the dns server in dhcp. This is common however d-link's dns relaying has a flaw. Dns lookups are cached and fill up the allocated dns memory. Once this memory is exhausted the router hangs on subsequent dns lookups for about ten minutes until the memory is cleared and the caching starts over. I have the latest firmware 2.0.0. I experience this issue about once or twice a day. Turning off dns relay fixes the problem but the router should not be broken by default and this defeats the benefit of dns relay which is faster dns lookups.One thread detailing the issue: [....]
5,Great Purchase,"I have made such a great purchase of an items technology that I have no clue about. I did extensive research of different versions of wireless routers and made the decision to purchase the D-Link. What a fast, solid performer. I am sitting in my living room 40 feet and numerous rooms/walls away from router and have excellent signal strength. I set up security settings during the simple setup and feel confident with its features. Best of all to this point was the customer service. Yes I had to call customer service during the setup. It was a simple procedure, but because of my unfamiliarity with my new laptop, I did not turn the network switch on. I did not know this, and called the D-Link customer service. She attemted to resolve the problem and after a few minutes was more than curious when it was discovered that I had made the error. Look no further when looking for a decent, upper midlevel router for your home or office use."
3,"True 3-star, solid value","For the price, this is watch has a classic look. The instructions are poor and funtionality of the timers are medium. If you plan to use the extra bells and whistles, consider another product. If you want a classic Callaway look at a fair price, this is your watch."
4,"""The Captain's Paradise""","I enjoyed , ""The Captain's Paradise"" ! I am surprised that it hasn't been re-filmed. The story line still holds up well and todays audience should still enjoy it !"
5,It is difficult to find the perfect wife.,"Alec Guinness thinks he's found a solution to this age old problem, but it doesn't quite work out.I found this movie to be more of a study of female psychology rather than the male.We learn that most women have two sides; naughty, and nice.This is why men find women like Sophia Loren (not in this movie) so attractive, because Sophia is 'Good' and 'Bad' at the same time.Captain's Paradise is a terrific movie and lots of fun. The movie starts right up with no trailers, commercials, or other delays. The quality is excellent."
4,damned if you do & damned if you dont,"twixt 1949 (""kind hearts and coronets"") and 1959 (""our man in havana""), alec guiness made a slew of great comedies. this one is more boulevard farce than the others, wherein he portrays a ferry captain with two lives -- & two wives -- in different ports. with celia johnson, he is the veddy propah englishman, while with yvonne de carlo, he is a gay blade. it works perfectly for a while, but of course, as all good things do, ..."
3,Not one of Alec's best films but enjoyable,"I think one reviewer referred to the film as sexist, and I would have to agree, which may have affected my enjoyment of the film. I think it did reflect views in the early fifties, but the overall problem was that the movie seemed quite dated (forgiveable, I suppose, after 50 years, but some movies much older don't seem dated in the same way).The plot involves the captain of a ferry boat that goes back and forth between Gibraltar and North Africa. The captain's search for paradise appears to have been reached -- he has a wife on each side of the straits, and each wife specializes in some aspect of the perfect wife -- one is sexy, Spanish, and exotic, the other is domestic and very British. Neither, of course, knows about the other, but eventually his paradise starts to fall apart.It's amusing, but somehow didn't hold my interest all that well. It's worth watching, but I wouldn't rewatch it."
3,Alec the Great,"""The Captain's Paradise"" (1953) exists primarily as a showcase for Alec Guinness, whose masterful characterization dominates this uneven bigamist farce. Yvonne De Carlo also shines in one of her best roles as Guinness' red-hot Moroccan spouse, with Celia Johnson memorably playing the British wife in port. The dance sequence between Guinness and De Carlo is a standout. Alec Coppel's screenplay received an Oscar nomination."
4,Not Quite Ealing But Enjoyable Nonetheless,"This screwball farce must have been quite provocative in it's day but would be considered tame by today's standards. There's still alot to enjoy here even though the film doesn't attain the classic heights of Alec Guiness' Ealing work. It's kind of a departure for Guiness to play such an amoral heel and he seems to relish it. And he does a mean flamenco as demonstrated in his scenes with Yvonne DeCarlo. Speaking of DeCarlo, she's a revelation here as the saucy Spanish vixen that Guiness' captain has holed up in Tangiers. She not only smolders onscreen but she has a deft comic touch. Celia Johnson is good as well as the proper English wife that Guiness assumes is content with the role he prescribes for her. On the whole a consistently funny film. Watch for a clever twist at the end that took me by surprise because there is no way it would have passed American censors at that time and took me aback that it passed British censors."
2,Not Quite Everything It Could Have Been,"Some of these stories were really good, but some were a disappointment. As a long-time fan of the Trek universes, I expected more. It is hard to believe that of the many submissions the editor had to choose from, better choices were not found. I have not yet read the second volume in this series, but I hope it is a better and more consistent collection.Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel ""To Be Chosen"""
5,Great Short Stories!,"The stories in this book were great. Some of these authors should become regular Star Trek novel writers! No matter what series you like, it's all here, and every Trek fan should read this!"
1,not her best at all,"No - not another regency with the plain, spunky girl who wins the heart of the rake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Story was very slow and I too wanted to knock Ada on the head for being such a nitwit. Chas was a decent man and Ada was plain annoying in how she kept turning away his help and love and marraige offer. Someone as desperate as her would have married him if nothing else but for her family. That is how it was done back them, wasn't it??"
3,Writing In The Asylum: Student Poets In City Schools,I felt the author spent too much time blaming politicians for the situations going on in the NYC high school and less on the positives of the program she was a part of. I taught in basically the same situation as the author and didn't feel so negative about everything.
5,great from laundry,"I use this to sort my dirty clothes. For some reason it's easier for me to sort them as I go than once I'm ready to do a load of laundry. It actually doesn't take up that much space and has cut down my laundry time. I bought this when the price was a lot lower than $50.I was looking for something with multiple bags that come out easily, so the fact that the product is very sturdy and the wheels work great is a great plus."
2,Quality control,"Two of the 8 corners that must be assembled were faulty. They had bumps inside from bad welds that blocked the tubes from being inserted. DH fixed it in the shop with a drill, but otherwise I'd have had to return it."
2,Bueno,"No es lo que esperaba, el olor es bueno dentro del estuche, al usarlo no huele igual y dura poco"
4,Nice for the money,"I'm really happy with these chairs, even though they were kind of a pain to put together. Unfortunately, the directions are screwed up and I had to take apart and put together a couple of times to get them right. However, once I got them done I really like them. Perfect smaller kitchen chairs which is just what I wanted."
4,Spencer Tracy's best performance!,"There's something strange about ""Captain Courageous"", in a way that the story is overdone, never entirely convincing, and always, always predictible. But it grabs you with it deep into the sea, and never let you breathe. Spencer Tracy makes the movie alone, and entirely alone. He gives his best performance that I know of, and his relationship with Harvey( the little kid) is so touching and vibrant that you feel for both of them, reflecting somehow a reality when you're fishing for three months on a boat. The storm sequence, is also very convincing considering the film was made in 1937, and that's a very impresisve achievement. I never found myself thinking once that it looked fake, I was just so moved by the characters...."
5,Great Movie Good Transfer,I have loved this movie since I was a little kid. It's great to have it on DVD now. Seems like there are parts on this DVD that were never on the VHS version but I may just be crazy. Sound is very clean for such an old movie and video quality is about as good as it gets.
5,Captains Courageous,"Captains CourageousI love old movies and this is the best of my collections. Watching it brought such great memories.Thanks,Dana"
3,Fun movie,"Really solid movie. But the sound what out of sync for a large portion of the movie - some kind of streaming problem that I've had with Amazon Instant before (but never, for example, with Netflix Instant)."
3,Good movie to show importance of working hard!,"After reading the book Captains Courageous by Rudyard Kipling, I really wanted to bring home this message of the importance of hard work to my family. I have three boys and I really want them to understand how valuable hard work is - and living in the suburbs with all the access kids have today to high tech gadgets to waste their time, I am constantly looking for things that promote hard work! Well, we watched the movie as a family and to be perfectly honest, it wasn't a hit. Sure, the message was okay, but the movie was very slow and hard to follow. I wouldn't say don't get the movie - but the book is SO MUCH BETTER! If your family is looking for a good movie with a good message, this is fine. If your family is looking for a great book with a great message, read Captains Courageous!"
4,Exciting movie -- beautiful format,"Although somewhat dated, ""Captains"" is still moving, and most of the ship shots aren't stock footage or miniatures -- Fleming shot a real ship, off the coast of California. The cast is excellent (who knew John Carradine was so handsome when young?), and, despite an accent stolen from Chico Marx, Spencer Tracy is powerful, as usual.Film seems to have been restored for the DVD; it's in excellent shape. Extras include MGM shorts and a cartoon."
5,"Billy Joel sang ; ""They don't make'm like that anymore.""","O these timeless classics, on Saturday Nights,we have family night home with the movies and we invite friends and family.Movies like this one you can bring-em all and what a terrific morality Hollywood once enjoyed,if America Would Turn their backs on Movies that Represent our Depravity and support Movies that once made America a Moral country then Hollywood would turn towards""What-Sells"" Question What do you Watch Today."
4,Amazing movie,"Trivia: This movie has the actor John Carradine who is the father to David and Keith Carradine!I watch this movie every few years so I was happy to find it on Amazon VideoIt's a little corny in places (so was star wars) but in the end it's an amazing mix of action, personalities, ethics and emotions.In it's own way it's almost as good as To Kill a Mockingbird and Grapes of Wrath. I mean just one small step below. Which means it's a must see movie especially if you like classics, cuz this is about as classic as it gets. I think it is the oldest movie i've ever seen.4 stars only for being a bit long in places."
4,Great movie,"I saw this as a little kid and liked it. I saw it as an adult and I liked it. I had my kids watch it and they were 'meh'. What's wrong with kids these days? Watch for yourself, little fish!"
2,Not the best version of Captain's Courageous,"Rudyard Kiplings beautiful novel, Captain's Courageous, is about the experiences of a rich, spoiled 15 year old boy who must adapt to the working man's life on a fishing schooner after falling off a luxurious ocean liner. The part didn't really fit Freddie Bartholonew, who was about 13 at the time and looked no more than 10. But he was a very popular child actor with lots of box office draw, so Hollywood destroyed the character of Harvey Cheyne in an effort to make it fit Freddie Bartholomew. It wasn't Bartholomew's fault, but it spoiled the film. Another version was released in 1977 starring Karl Malden, Ricardo Montalban, and Jonathan Kahn as Harvey Cheyne. This is an execellent version, and the one I would like to see made available on DVD."
3,Not Enough Mickey Rooney,"This movie is a great story, but Mickey Rooney did not have enough part in this film. He is only seen a couple times for a brief moment. I bought this film hoping to see more of him since he is my favorite actor and was sorely disappointed. Spencer Tracy is just great in this movie. This is one of Spencer Tracy's best performances. So, if you are a Tracy fan I would highly recommend this movie. Freddie Barthomew was outstanding and was the main character of the movie. So, I say all that to say this. It's a great movie, but if you are a Mickey Rooney fan you will be sorry not to see him in the movie often."
5,A CLASSIC TREAT!,Another holiday classic to enjoy that will bring back fond memories of the sixties and or will cause new moments to remember. A treat for all young and old. The aire dates for the sixties are as follows.NBC 7:30 - 8 Thursday 12/19/68NBC 7:30 - 8 Thursday 12/18/69Enjoy this DVD. A collectors must.
5,"This is not a review, just a question...","A friend of mine invited me to watch this movie... I have not seen it yet, first I read all your reviews. I'm doubtful of watch it because I don't know if it will let me several doubts about the justice and goodness of God, affecting in a negative way my faith... Also, as a Christian-Protestant, I dont know if is good to hear for two hours a lot of heresies...Should I watch it? Some suggestion? I'm sorry, I know this is not an advice site.Thanks in advance,Ruben"
3,Excellent but flawed,"The numerous five-star reviews have for the most part accurately depicted this film. It is a high quality movie in its acting, screenplay, direction and editing.However ... the ""judge"" at the trial must constantly remind the participants that the issue is the COVENANT, and whether God broke it.As I understand the Covenant, God's keeping it was dependent on the Israelites' keeping it. Over and over throughout the Torah and the Prophets, we are presented with the Israelites' lack of faithfulness, as early as their grumbling in the wilderness and their worshiping of the Golden Calf.The movie barely mentions the Israelites' breaking the Covenant, which I felt was a serious flaw. Such a relevant issue should never be omitted from a ""trial"" of God's keeping or not keeping the Covenant."
5,A thought provoking drama,"This drama is powerfully written and acted. It poses and discusses some of the 'big' questions about faith and loss, and I highly recommend it."
5,God On Trial -- Humanity the Judge,"This film deals with the problem of evil in a particularly harrowing and intensive way--several condemned prisoners in a Nazi death camp, among them a rabbi, a few educated men, and one ""stoolie"" who cooperates with the Nazis in order to eat better and increase his chances of survival--come to the astonishing and disturbing decision that God should go on trial. After all, did not God create this world and all the people in it, including the ""Chosen People"" the Jews--the people most especially dear to him? Why does God permit such monsters as the Nazis to experience triumph and satisfaction, while the Chosen People are condemned to die in the mass extinctions whose horrors will echo through the ages.The verdict of the prisoners comes after agonizing soul-searching--and the end of the film, though a foregone conclusion, somehow still leaves us clinging to hope."
2,HOLLAND COMPANION PORTABLE GRILL,"What a dissapointment! Simply would NOT stay lit. Poor quality workmanship on Mexican made gas valve, the fit was so bad we called before using. We returned this....Do not waste your $$$.Do not confuse this grill with the full size Holland Grills. No comparison at all!!!Buy a full size Holland and you will be a very Happy Camper."
5,Holland Companion,Excellent product. We have the Holland Companion grill in Arizona for the winter months and now have one in Minnesota. NO flare ups!! Meat is always moist and tender. Easy to cook for 4 people. Highly recommend!
3,Way Too Slow,"I have owned two full sized Holland grills, and I absolutely love them. Based on that experience, I bought the Companion grill for tailgating. Unfortunately, the grill never reaches a high enough temperature for me to cook effectively at a tailgate. Any meat with thickness to it takes forever to get reasonably done, and since I am usually cooking for a large crowd, I can never keep up with demand. I think the grill is fine for cooking for a small group when you have plenty of time, but it isn't very good if you need to cook something faster. I have resorted to grilling the meat the night before on my big Holland and just warming it up on the Companion at the tailgate. One other item of note, even though the grill comes with a box for the Holland wood chips, the temperature never gets hot enough to create smoke, hence no smoky flavor."
1,Avoid This Grill At All Costs!,"See the review of Dallas Ryan that he wrote on 4 April 2010. He nailed it exactly.Like him, I also had a previous Holland tower grill similiar to the Maverick model they currently sell... I bought mine in 1993 and I still have it and it STILL works. A great product, though you do have to learn how to grill with it. As it shows it age now, we keep it at our mountain cabin, but it still works fine.Like Dallas, I bought the Home Companion grill for our RV and had exactly the SAME experience as he did. What an expensive disappointment.DO NOT BUY THIS GRILL if you will use it where there is any chance of any wind at all."
1,"Portable oven, not a grill.","Either you'll love it or hate it. I bought it to grill steaks, which doesn't work at all. I like a ""hot"" grill that will brown a steak, with 3 or 4 minutes per side. After 4 years, I haven't had a good grilled steak yet. This is not my only grill. I bought it for traveling in the fifth-wheel. If you like your steaks cooked in an oven on low heat, this grill will meet your expectations. You'll go through a lot propane with this slow cooker. If your a true griller, you'll hate it. 18 minutes with the lid closed to bake a ribeye medium rare doesn't cut it with me. I wish I had read an honest review of the real capabilities of this piece of cookery before I wasted my money. I'll take those pesky flareups any day."
1,Very unreliable,"For the record, this is my second Holland product. The large home model I had for over 10 years and loved it. That is why I bought the ""companion"" model for my RV outings.It worked well, only when it would stay lit. When I first got it, it would absolutely not stay lit. I tried a different hose, different propane source, both the small disposable and large tank with hose and had same problem with it going out in the most gentle breeze. Called the company and they sent me a new regulator and it worked slightly better. When I use the grill, I have to set it up and surround it with plywood to protect it from the wind and even then, a wayward breeze will blow it out. Today, I've had it. This is the last time I will use it and it's going into the trash and I'll purchase something else. There are lots of other small portable gas grill I see on this site that have 4 and 5 star ratings and I'll give one of them a try."
5,Spandau Ballet at the height of their success!,"This DVD captures a great 80's band at their best. This concert, in support of the album Through the Barricades, shows what a great live band Spandau Ballet is. The sound quality is excellent, and it is obvious that the band is having fun on stage, especially with To Cut a Long Story Short, Revenge for Love and Fight for Ourselves.The extras include videos for songs from Through the Barricades and it's follow up, Heart Like a Sky. A documentary of the making of the video Fight for Ourselves is good also. This DVD was a project of Gary Kemp and it is obvious that he put some work into it. A definite must have for a fan of 80's music."
3,Poor DVD transfer!,"While it's wonderful to have this document of some of Martha Graham's most famous work available on DVD, something must have gone awry in the digital transfer. There are a number of moments in ""Appalachian Spring,"" for example, where the visual image suddenly slows down for a few seconds, and then slips into a sort of ""fast forward"" mode to catch back up to the music. I don't believe this can be a flaw in only my copy.These problems didn't exist in the wonderful 1995 Voyager release on laser disc of the same films, ""Martha Graham Dance on Film."" And unfortunately the added features and commentaries included on the laser disc (audio commentaries, interviews with some of Graham's dancers, and with Aaron Copland, etc.) didn't make it to the DVD. Too bad!"
5,Great DVD,"Wonderful, historical footage of Martha Graham and members of her dance company. Great tool to use in my dance history class. Nice mix of actual interview footage with Graham and footage of her actual choreography and her dancing."
2,Get the silicone out,The pillow feels great! I had to silicone the suction cups on... then the suction cups are not strong enough to hold the fabulous pillow in place.(It floats up & head holds it down so it works.)It is the most comfortable bath pillow I have ever used so it got 2 stars.
5,Best Indi Horror Movie,The Skeleton Crew gives this film a 5 out of 5 stars. A bad ass horror flick for people who like some crazy ___ ____! Jonathan Tierston steals the show! Get this one! You wont regret it!
1,Disappointed,"The adds for this title are misleading. There are extremely few good moments in this dvd, and those are not that good. If it was $$$, I'd say you got what you paid for. And I've noticed they reuse footage in other titles in this series. I was very disappointed."
2,"2.5 stars, or 5 out of 10...","I don't know how the other girls gone wild movies are, but this Girls Gone Wild ON CAMPUS isn't all that good. It has a FEW good shots of girls showing up or taking off their skirts and showing good shots. But mostly this is basicly different girls flashing the camara for like 5 seconds. I'd say this is just for something to watch at a bachelor/frat type of party where its just you and your boys watching while rating girls. I'd say RENT THIS if you can."
3,Reality Video,"This DVD shows the standard Girls Gone Wild formula, which is some guys using digital video cameras and catching girls flashing. It's cool for a little while, but the flashing shots are so quick and hearing girls scream, then the crowd scream... I think they have a newer video that come out this month called America's Wildest Bachelor Parties that's hotter."
4,Good for light jobs,"It feels a little cheap because it's plastic, but that doesn't seem to hinder it's performance. Blows up pool floats very quickly and all the adapters make it a no brainer for lots of different needs. I recommend it for light jobs... pool floats, bicycle tires, balloons, etc. I would probably get something surdier or electric for things like air mattresses. And it's not compact so I wouldn't take it camping unless you just have the space in your truck (definitely not for backpacking/hiking).Overall, I'm satisfied because we bought it for pool floats. Can't beat the price!"
4,fast and quick,"I just used it for the first time. it pumped up my inflatable kayak in minutes. i also have a electric pump, which i didn't use ,as the pump was fast and easier to tell when bags were full.the treaded adapter didn't fit on all that well, but other wise would recomend to my beat friend."
5,Works great to inflate the Valeo exercise ball!,"My first exercise ball (a BellFit exercise ball purchased locally and returned) taught me how gruesomely hard, even impossible it can be to properly inflate the exercise ball with the sometimes junky plastic pump provided. I bought the Kwik Tek Airhead Double Action Hand Pump through Amazon. It comes with four different plugs, one of which fit the Valeo perfectly. Since the pump inflates both on the up and downstroke, I had the ball properly inflated in under 5 easy minutes.Since the pump comes with four different plugs, I expect to get a lot of use from this pump in the years to come. However, the price of the pump was worth it just to inflate my exercise ball this morning."
4,A good pump for the price,"I have used this air pump a couple of times, and I have no complaints. The double action allows you to quickly pump up whatever you want. I also used it as a bellows to get my fire going while I was camping, and it worked great for that too. It helps to have another person with you, because you really need two hands and two feet to work the pump, so you need a third hand to hold the nozzle. Pumping with one hand is possible but a little tricky.My one concern about this pump is that it may not be very durable-- but that's the trade-off when you buy cheap plastic stuff. If it breaks anytime soon I'll try to update my review."
2,Big & Plastic,"I bought this pump to use on my Gaiam exercise ball chair. Not only do the adapters not fit the ball, the item is quite tall (about up to my knee) and completely plastic. It's going back."
5,Perfect fix for DTC code P1404 error,My 1998 Chevy S-10 Pick Up truck would not pass inspection in NJ due to this DTC code error. Amazon had the best price and I received the new EGR Valve in a few days. It was easy to install and my vehicle passed inspection and is running great.
5,Redeemable but redemptrix herself,"where role model is sought, the most likely found is beyond our grasp. That is an opinion about this book, written 10 years ago. unfortunately nobody payattention. In this short concised Mariology, you may find an answer tothe author's question himself. And youcould conclude that both sides of humanand divine status of Mary as a mother isjust there. I would recommend anyone interested in Mariology to read it. Maria Angelica Maya Sidharta."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"So bad in fact I couldn't even finish watching it. There are so many other, and MUCH better vampire movies out there. Don't waste your time on this one. Those people who gave this movie outstanding reviews, must work for Timecrap films, or what ever they're called. Thrust me on this!"
4,Good supplement to the Big Book,"This is a great supplement to the big book, especiall if you are a group leader or if you just want to improve you understanding of the 12 Steps."
4,The Little Red Book,A pocket sized guide to the Big Book of AA. A good preview and course guide through the period of recovery and the maintainance of sobriety.
1,What is very good condition?,I was excited to get this book. I opened it up and pages fell out. Now that makes a satisfied customer!
1,NEVER ORDER AGAIN FROM AMAZON,I would never use Amazon again - I had a horrible experence - they sent me the wrong book - and I will not be bothered to send it back - I will just get in my car and go and see the book before I buy it -
3,hard to use for study,"This is a basic recovery book, but I found it hard to use for study. However, good for just reading."
3,not happy with change in size,"I have an older copy of this book and it is truly a little red book. I was very dissapointed to find this has changed. I ordered it to pair with another book as a gift and the size made it much less attractive and the ""set"" was not matching. I think most poeple would pay the extra dollar or 2 to keep it small and hardback like the original.The service related to the order was perfectly fine, but just not happy with the products."
3,Who did the copy editing?,"I love the content of this book - it is practical, informative and filled with good solid information for the practice of the twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.My biggest problem, which brought it down from what would have been a five star review to a three star, is the copy editing or lack thereof. The formatting throughout the entire book is inconsistent. Sometimes there are spaces after the paragraphs sometimes there aren't. Sometimes the text even breaks off in the middle of the sentence. I don't get it - is it really that difficult to get a decent copy editor?"
3,Proofreader needed,"The content is fine; a little on the overkill side if you have read your Big Book and 12 and 12. But, either no one proofed the thing or the person who did failed grammer. The mistakes make for a tough read."
1,I do not recommend this book,"This book is published from BN Publishing not Hazelton. The print layout is hard to read, there are typos and the wording is different from the Hazelton ""Little Red Book"". If you are looking for the ""Little Red Book"" order from Hazelton Publishers"
5,The Little Red Book,"I have found this book to be a very helpful supplement to my recovery/self help reading. It compliments the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous and enlarges my understanding and therefore my ability to be helpful as a participating member in the fellowship of A.A.. It is small and travels well. I find it to be another valuable tool for the recovery from alcoholism. To be used along with, but not instead of, the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous."
2,not totally impressed,"So far I have only used one application of this product. I like it because it did give me the gray coverage that I want and it was very easy to use and not messy at all. My complaint is that the color doesn't seem to last very long. The box suggests that you should use it every time you touch up your hair (every 6 weeks or so), but it's only been about 2 weeks and I need to touch it up already. I left it on for 30 minutes just like the instructions said, but.....the color just didn't stay. Maybe I will leave it on a few extra minutes this time. Overall the product does work but the results don't seem to be long lasting."
3,No personal experience.,"Since this was a gift, I cannot speak to its efficacy. I bought it for a friend to use as an alternative to shaving, in order to hide greying pubic hair. She has not reported on how well it works."
3,"Entertaining, but there are a few problems...","I am an avid Starfist saga follower, and that will continue, but I thought Startfist 7 was a little weak. The cliffhanger ending needed some more beefing up (Gunny Bass put himself in a dangerous situation without following some simple combat rules he knows very well). Also, many Skinks are flashed (killed), but the 34th FIST never once recovered any of the Skink's acid weapons for analysis. The weapons didn't flash and disappear when the Skinks did, did they? No, of course not! Recovering an acid weapon and analyzing it to develop a defense against it would be the first thing I'd do.Worth reading to keep the series alive, but I hope Dan Cragg reads this review and takes steps to improve plot quality..."
3,"Harry Potter postcard book, The Chamber of Secrets","I am not that happy with this booklet of cards. I belong to a postcard exchange group, with many HP fans. I will only use the front cover cards, most of them have too much collage junk on them. I wouldn't have purchased this booklet if I had been able to see inside it."
3,"It's Good Stuff, but they're really just a Beach Boys Knock Off","Listen, The Songs on this CD are good. It's quality Surfer Rock Music, that sounds like an imitation of the Beach Boys. Since it is an Imitation of the Beach Boys, it's not as good, and unless your really desperate for new Surfer Rock, pass on this Album. I'd buy it, if I didn't feel like I was listening to some cheap imitation of the Beach Boys (who make the same kind of music only a lot better). Nonetheless, you may not feel like I do, and might have some fun with this album. Listen to it before you buy it, but ultimately you'll here a couple of struggling L.A. Rock'n Roll wannabees who want to be a Better Surfer sound than the Legendary Beach Boys. Actually, It's kind of sad, that they'd try to compete with the Beach Boys, because the Beach Boys are ultimately better and more creative. (Note: This Band was run by Murry Wilson, the Beach Boys sleazy Father)."
5,bdat,I love this series. Kristine Smith draws an amazing world and realistic characters. A joy to read and escape into.
2,scratchy,I was disappointed with the fabric on this bra....it was scratchy and itchy but I had washed it so I couldn't return it......def not worth the high price
1,Very Uncomfortable.....,"I just received this bra and after wearing it for half an hour, realized I must return it. I found the fabric to be extremely scratchy and uncomfortable. Straps were very hard to adjust and set to the correct length. Worst of all, my breasts popped out of the sides. This bra did give me a lovely shape but if it was uncomfortable , scratchy, sized too small etc....I didn't want to have to keep it. It will be returned. I certainly do not think this is a $65.00 bra."
1,U-G-L-Y,"I am pregnant and was looking for a minimizer. However, this was not it! First, it looks like something a 70 year old grandmother would wear. Secondly, it just separated and flattened my breasts, pushing them into my armpits and making look both large and flat- Yikes!!! Just sent it back for a refund. So sad that Wacoal would make an expensive bra that looks like something I would get at a Walmart. I went back to my embrace lace Wacoal, that does not minimize, but is very attractive."
2,Not worth it,I like the Wacoal bras for their fit and comfort. It's not worth the price because the bras don't even last a year. I bought 4 of this style along with several other styles. I hand washed them as instructed and rotated them throughout the week. I'm a 34DD. They were not overstretched in any way. The back wing on all of them started to come apart after about 8 months of wear. The fabric is cheap and not a good value.
5,Minimizer Bra,"This bra provides excellent support and actually does minimize. It is comfortable, fits well, and looks nice. I have been wearing this bra for 5 years and love it."
3,underwire pokes,I like the look of the bra and it gives great support but the underwire digs into my sides.
2,Not for me!,"I found this Bra to be VERY uncomfortable and not complimentary. However, I later learned it was not the correct size for me so while I didn't like the Bra I can't give it the worst rating."
5,Great read-aloud book,"Some books are good for independent/silent reading but they do not make good read-alouds. The House in the Snow is both. It is interesting to both boys and girls and is packed with exciting situations. My favorite extension is to have my 4th grade students draw the ""invisible"" fight scene. Because this book is out of print, I have been looking for used copies! I bought 3! Because it is out of print, most students have never heard the story which makes reading it to them more interesting."
4,Thank you!,"I received my order on time and in good condition. It would have been helpful if the post-its of the previous owner were removed, but other than that, I'm quite pleased with the product!"
5,Good show for a good price,"I really liked this adaptation of the X-men, with a lot of great voice actors and an interesting plot. DVD came as described."
2,"Tired storylines, 1990's animation and too many X-Men","My title says it all.Good Points:The art is good but the actual animation is another story.Some stories featuring certain X-men are very well done.Sound, voice acting and effects are great.The blu-ray version contains all the episodes among other features.Bad Points:Too many X-men leads to lifeless characters that you dont care about. Being a Cyclops fan they did the worst job for Scott Summers (the original leader of the X-Men)The animation still looks 1990'ish. Stiff and robot-like.The storylines get old fast especially if you've read the X-Men since the 1970's through the 90's. Government capturing mutants, the phoenix, Magneto etc etc.Can Marevl pick a team of X-men and stick with it? Can they also simply just do some new adventures with new villains? Maybe never....."
3,This bluray,I can't believe that this series is coming out on bluray and NOT the 90s series. The X-men 90s series must be the first one on blu-ray discs in hd quality and 5.1 or maybe 7.1 master audio.
1,hollywood is killing the x men,"Wolverine is my favorite character and i love the x men, I thought the movies were horrible, in order to enjoy them I had to forget everything I loved about the x men in the first place and their real stories and personalities then its not to bad for a movie, now with this cartoon wolverine is suddenly the leader and cyclops is the rebel like they switched roles that is out of character for both of them. The best thing about the x men is that they were diverse they were one of the first super hereos that were ""the norm"" for a kid who doesnt know the history of the comics or anybody else I guess this is ok to watch but it looses touch with what the x men stood for in the first place. So enjoy."
4,"Starts slow, but finishes strong","Stories start out pretty cookie cutter on the 1st disc (3 disc set), but evolve to featuring Archangel's origin, a 3 episode Phoenix saga, Sentinels, episodes featuring the Hell Fire Club, Emma Frost & the Stepford Cuckoos.There's subtle nods to the Grant Morrison New X-Men run and Whedon's Astonishing X-Men, making this a lot of fun for fans of the comics.While this show was ""for kids,"" adults will get enjoyment out of it with all of the nods to the more modern day X-Men comics. I certainly did."
3,Not the bext X-Men series on DVD,"There's a reason this show was canceled. The animation is great, and the voice acting is pretty good, but that's about it. At least it makes no qualms about who the star of the show is. Wolverine is front and center, but he shouldn't be. The writers can't decide if Wolverine is a tough-guy loner, a team player, or a sappy pat-your-head-and-be-on-your-merry-way father figure. Juggling those roles makes him master at none, leading to inconsistent characterization. Not to mention that they seem to be repeating plot points from the previous two X-Men cartoons, where they were done better. But man does it look pretty. If you haven't seen either of the older X-men cartoons, go ahead and give this a try. Your kids will probably love it, but those expecting more than the standard punch-the-bad-guys cartoon will be disappointed."
5,For those of you who can't wait,"You can purchase the entire first season from amazon.ca (canada); it comes in a pretty sweet metal case. It's region 1 so it works with all US players. Just a thought for those of you, who like me, didn't want to purchase 5 separate volumes and also didn't want to wait ages for the US release.A fantastic series, well worth it to any Marvel/ comic enthusiast and a must buy for any X-Men fan. Series has big story arcs much like its awesome predecessor that I grew up with in the mid-90s.Enjoy!"
5,excellent series,This television show was great on tv. But I was highly pset to find out it was canceled after a good first season.
2,poor and a little beat up,the book is nice but i am really disappointed on how beat up it was. i wish they were a little clearer on its status.
4,Informational Book,"After viewing an excellent pbs science program on strangeconditions caused by physical problems with the brain.I wanted to continue the journey and shopped around fora book that would explore the brain in more depth. This bookpresents a macro view of the brain and a thought provokingexperiment that explored the interaction between the conscious and subconscious. The book is easy to read, has supporting graphics and is a execellent way to learn the generalities of the brain processing. However, don't expect all questions to be answered. The science of the brain has a long way to go. I would have liked more theories and expert speculation to suppliment science's unknowns. I read it cover to cover."
5,Introduces the reader to many historical figures of Kabbalah since Abrahamic times,"Awakening To Kabbalah: The Guiding Light Of Spiritual Fulfillment by Rav Laitman is an outstanding documentation of the author's observations on spiritual enlightenment, metaphysical awareness, and fulfillment that through the years as a spiritualist and scientist has come to understand. Insightfully progressive, Awakening To Kabbalah introduces the reader to many historical figures of Kabbalah since Abrahamic times, as well as informs of an intricate and enabling path to ultimate contentment. Awakening To Kabbalah is very strongly recommended to non-specialist general readers with an interest in Jewish Mysticism in general, and Metaphysical Studies in particular."
5,Excellent Kabbalah Introductory Book,"Rav Michael Laitman once again composes a book that differs fundamentally from all other Kabbalah books: it speaks about you, and not about some abstract issues or behavioral conducts.""Awakening to Kabbalah"" is aimed at anybody who has an interest in spirituality, and as you read the book, that interest grows. You find yourself testing things that you read in the book in your everyday life, which bring questions, and you take those questions back to the book. Each time you find you learn more about Kabbalah, it means you have learned something more about yourself; and in turn, you learn how much you don't know.Essentially, what it does is it invites the reader into the spiritual process which is the wisdom of Kabbalah. If questions like ""who am I?"" ""what is reality?"" and ""what is the purpose of everything here?"" haunt you, then you will love what this book has to offer."
5,A Guide book to build your spiritual foundation,"If you are interested in exploring the subject of spirituality, Awakening to Kabbalah will be like choosing an experienced travel agent. Rav Laitman has assembled all the facts creating a fascinating read.You'll walk through a bit of history revealing informational background about individuals we all have read or heard about but never knew the whole story. As you read on, you will get answers to questions so many of us have asked. Do we have freedom of choice?How do we control our destiny? What happens after we die? This book will answer many of those questions and help you to understand this most discussed subject of spirituality and how Kabbalah fits into the whole picture."
2,Awakening to Kabbalah: The Guiding Light of Spiritual Fulfillment,"This is the book that I've been looking for all my life. If you are completely happy with your life and have no questions about the meaning of existence, this book is not for you. It reveals the spiritual world's simple secrets to the reader who seeks to quench his or her soul's spiritual thirst. If you see this book on the shelf of a book store, don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to advance toward your ultimate destination."
1,cheap,Doesn't look like this - looks cheap - very very heavy with a chain not a strap so impossible to carry. if i didn't have to pay rediculous shipping (so heavy) I would have returned it
5,Works Great,This OTC 7448 works great. I found the adapter on-line for my car and the OTC cleaning fluid Kleen-R locally and cleand my fuel injectors. The dealer wanted $230 to do the cleaning. I cleaned my wife's and son's car injector's as well so much cheaper than paying a dealer to do the work.
2,Dangerous malfunction,The cleaner did its job but but after the job was done I coundn't relieve the pressure in the container due to a malfunction in the pressur regulator. Sent it back.
4,Cleaned Injectors,"Fuel injector cleaner works great. Easy to use. Drawback does not come with any adapters, must use adapter from pressure tester kit. Different brands of cleaner fluid work just fine."
5,Works great!,"Works great, Very high quality, thick aluminum. I could drive over this and it would hold. Instructions were easy to follow and learn. Definitely a good shop tool"
3,Low-carb => no heartburn: not a new concept,"I have not read this book but am simply commenting on the fact that a few medical studies and tons of anecdotal evidence exist that support this book's premise. You certainly don't need to buy this book or follow his special diet to find out for yourself that eating fewer refined carbs will reduce/eliminate heartburn. I found this out accidentally when I went on the South Beach diet for several months - within 3 days I noticed I wasn't having any heartburn (normally a twice-daily occurrence that was so bad I would get headaches from the pain). This discovery was a miracle that literally changed my life and while I may not be dieting any longer, I still eat very few refined carbs. When I do indulge, the heartburn comes roaring back. So, buy the book if you're interested in this particular diet plan, but it's really not necessary if you just want to know that fewer carbs means less heartburn."
3,Heartburn Cured The Low Carb Miracle,An interested concept. It takes a book to tell you something the author could have explained in one chapter or an article. I still haven't been able to try this conept so I can't say if it will work or not. This reads like a technical paper - it just isn't very reader friendly.
5,Heartburn Cured - For Real,"Great book on the dietary causes of GERD and a very easy read. The information given, by the author, was detailed without being overwhelming to the layperson. The diagrams and illustrations really added a lot to understanding the digestive process and how various carbohydrates affect the digestive system."
4,Trim Kit for microwave,"The kit was easy to install and made the space look ""finished."" The only issue I had was that the screws that are visible from the outside of the kit. However, this was the only kit that fit my space. The other kits that I looked at connected to the inside of the cabinet."
5,The Beginner Series...this tempted me to start...and I still love it!!,"I have tried Pilates, Jazzercize, Zumba and this...this is what started on a ""yoga-trend;"" and out of all the movement routines...this is still the best for me. At 53 years old, this provides me with excellent movement and exercise with great results. The presentation of positions, the transitions between moves, and the reminders to breathe are an excellent blend to the success of this program."
3,It's okay.,"The description of the yoga sequence was not quite clear, I was expecting something more strenuous along with strength building."
5,My Favorite Yoga Tape Ever,"This continues to be the best, most satisfying and relaxing tape I ever do. Alan Finger does the best job of any instructor in reminding us to breathe (otherwise I forget!) and in explaining how to do the poses correctly and why. I also like the 55-minute format much better than any shorter videos. This length makes me feel like I've worked out without rushing every pose, gives time to really stretch, and provides enough time for relaxation. I think Yoga Zone makes the best tapes of anyone."
5,Ultimate in relaxation,"I love this tape. I bought this based on others' reviews and must admit I love it too. When I bought it the stress I was under was making me ill, but after a few sessions with this tape, I literally felt more relaxed! The end of this tape is so soothing and I fall asleep at the end 9 out of 10 times I watch it! Highly recommend as a beginners tape and for anyone who needs to RELAX or wind down at the end of the day!"
4,Easier than other videos,"I own all of the Yoga Zone series videos, and of the main ones (Postures for Pregnancy and Meditation excluded), I think this is the easiest one. A few of the poses are more challenging, but as the video's title suggests, the goal is Stress Release, which means not over-exerting yourself. If you want relaxation, you'll love this video. If you want more intensity, or more flexibility and strength, look to the other video in the series- Flexibility and Tone, which is more challenging."
4,Very Good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this tape to help with my back and leg pains. I began doing this tape about 2 weeks and I feel the difference.There are two instructors so the positions are done either modified for for advance. The instructions are spoke well. It is best to watch the tape at least once before performing(this is best with all tapes).I am sleeping better and the back pain is easing up slowly. This tape is really for stress release. Removing it out of your arms, legs,back, neck, etc. If you are looking for sun salutions you will not find them here... I look for forward to purching additional Yoga Zone videos."
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"An exellent ""album"" (for those of you who remember what those were). The order and mixing is flawlessly smooth. This really gets your toes tappin' and your blood pumpin'. Truely puts you ""IN THE MOOD""."
1,"Unmusical, pedestrian, dreadful",It is astonishing that so fanciful and delightful a ballet could be reduced to such a pedestrian spectacle. Not even the music survives intact. Poor placement of the microphones destroyed the continuity of the sound. The choreography owes more to Cirque du Soleil than to Fokine. The principals are certainly flexible; it would have been interesting to see if they could dance. This tape went straight from the VCR to the trash-can. Only a devout masochist would watch it twice.
3,Firebird,I also had problems with the sound on the Firebird video. I thought it was just my copy but after reading the review prior to mine I realize that it was just poor sound quality.
1,Cute but worthless,"You won't find a cuter design...or...a more WORTHLESS glue. We followed the instructions religiously and could not get this PoC (if you need an explanation for the acronym I would be happy to supply it, but thought I would keep this as PC as possible) to stick to the wall. The glue didn't even feel remotely sticky to the touch. Better to spend your money on something else for the room because chances are you aren't going to get this where it should be. ARGH!"
3,Nice but shouldn't be more than $20.00,A 61 page book with reasonably good photographs. Retailed for perhaps $7.50. Held together by staples on the spine. A glorified pamplet. I like it but I wouldn't pay more than $20.00 for it and feel good about it.
4,This book is great,"I passed the CLEP on the first try with a 59, but this was not my first CLEP. I used this book, along with the practice exams on the web pages [...], and a review of the French history pages from Wikipedia. This book was a great help, as were the two practice tests on the included CD. I only had to study for about 4 days. This was an easy way to get college credit. I am only giving the book 4 stars because I had to read so much information on Wikipedia, and there were a lot of questions on the test that covered material not in the book.With all of that said, this book was key in my passing the test."
3,Won't help you pass..,I studied and studied for the Western Civ II test with this book and was correctly getting well over 100 right on the practice exams. I went to take the test today and only scored a 48. There were many topics on the test that this book didn't cover or even mention. This book alone will not help you pass this exam..
1,Will NOT help you pass actual test...,"Studied the book thoroughly, got 55 and 52% on REA tests in this book, then took an OFFICIAL CLEP test and got only 44%. Took the actual test and didn't pass; got only a 47% almost nothing covered in REA book was on the questions. If anything you need an additional textbook to study with to be able to pass. All the other REA books so far got me through but this one didn't. Sorry REA, you need to go into more detail for this test..."
4,"Great book, but be prepared","This book is much like the other REA guides I have used to get the 21 credits I now have; however, I noticed that the practice tests in the book were much easier than those in the CLEP Official Study Guide, as well as the actual CLEP. I highly recommend all the REA guides, but this particular one doesn't give as good a picture of one's preparedness as the others. I would aim for a raw score of 70-80 on the practice tests to consider myself adequately prepared for the CLEP."
3,Name the tune,I bought the CD because it was cheap and I wanted the name of the Tito Puente tune that had been haunting me for weeks. I never played the CD.
5,we love these books!!,i homeschool and my daughter and i find these books a very useful and fun way of studying history. she also enjoys fashion design and it is very interesting to see how fashions have changed through the centuries. hours of relaxing fun-not just for the kids!!
3,Woodcraft and camping,"Review of the free version for KindleI couldn't read it all so it's possible I missed something towards the end but what I did read was interesting from a historical and pioneering point of view.Be sure to keep an eye out for his bug repellent recipe, you might need it some day."
4,Dated but worthwhile.,"The information was dated, but well written and worth the reading. I do a lot of outdoors stuff and will use a lot of the general information with BSA and other youth groups. It makes you realize the need for progress in all areas of our life."
2,fun as history,"Glad it was free. It's always fun to read how something was done in the century before you were born. There is some useful stuff for the woods tramper, but you have to dig it out of all the arcania."
5,Life of an 1880s Conservationist and Wilderness Traveler,"The author was 40 years older than Horace Kephart who wrote a more extensive book with a similar title. Both men wrote for Field and Stream, both were conservationists, both were instrumental in having major wilderness parks established. Sears wrote under the pen name of Nessmuk and it is to his mentor, Nessmuk, that Kephart dedicates his book. Sear's wilderness was the Adirondacks and he set off in light-weight canoes he had made to his specifications. A great read whose philosophy of wilderness and camping will never be out of date."
5,a good book back to the basics,A good book for bac to the basics camping. nice to refresh your memory and catch a few tips you may have forgot.
5,I like this book,This is a great book to read if you are an out door enthusiast as it has usefull information as well as giving a glimpse into how it used to be. It dose take a bit of thinking on the readers part to understand as it was written a while ago.
4,Woodcraft and Camping,"great ideas and skills that might have been lost to history...I was impressed and enjoyed his sense of humor, kind of brings you back in time.."
1,wast of my time,just a blowhard bragging that he knows more than anyone elese. What little usefull information that is there could have been put on one page
3,Woodcraft and Camping,"This is a great little read,Price is right has lots of information..I love reading about the great outdoors and how to setup and survive in camp."
2,Web Viedo Recorder,"I baught this product for $6.00 at a outlet store. One with bright Orange stickers.+ It is easy to use and will recored everything inside a little box you highlight. It has a very easy setup, and very nice help bar. Will record nice little clips with or without sound, which is great for home made AMVs.- It only recoreds up to 2GB of footage. Which i thought was a lot but when looking at a regular Divx movie, it was only like a three-four min segments. The recorder did not tell me that my 2GB were running out, it just let me record. And then it would show me later that it was not going to work. All in all a short 18 min movie was broken up into 8 peices instead of two or three.All in all find another Media recorder if you want a long video."
5,"SAIL ON, KURT!","I wouldn't take offence here oh, Weill purists! These reconstructions are charming and harmonically reverent to their originals, more than could be said for many versions of the Weill Songbook through the decades, including Lou Reed's friendly `adaptation' of the September Song's chord progression and melodic line!Shoenberg and Webern expressed their disdain of Weill's music; curiously, Arnold had also disclosed a secret wish of having his own audiences walk back home ""whistling his tunes"", oh, don't ask why... You can certainly whistle, hum and sway your partner now, as the transatlantic's bouncy dancehall sails on just as Kurt, Lotte and the lot of them did when escaping the lethal hounds of early 30s Berlin.... the-next-little-dollar bound."
3,INTERESTING READ,"This book was a good read and full of useful information. However it doesn't address one major hurdle to losing weight.That is dieting doesn't work 95% of the time and most will get fatter after going off of a diet. I reccomend the book DIETS DON'T WORK. Americans need to give up thier obsession with food and eat to live, now live to eat. If you buy this book because you are interested in nutrition and feuling your body with the best energy sources then its worth it. If you really need to lose weight don't go on another diet, you'll just get fatter. You should get involved in activities, sleep enough, reach out to others, exercise, get some sunshine and give your body the best fuel you can to feel great. If you do these things you will lose weight!!"
1,If you want to stay fat and confused buy this book.,"I bought the book for the use of its glycemic index, but was put off by their diet suggestions which run counter to my own experience, and those of my friends who have had great experiences with Dr. Barry Sears ""The Zone"" diet, and other 40-30-30 books. A year ago I weighed 229 lbs. (I'm 6'4 1/2"")and my cholestrol was over 200. I lost 33 pounds in 3 months, and have stayed within a few pounds of my low to this day. My bad cholestrol dropped down to 181 while my good cholestrol went up over 50 for the first time. I personally challenge these diet gurus to publish a picture of themselves in a bathing suit to see just how great their diet really works. I've got my pictures ready.. and my blood results as well. How about it?"
5,NOT A DIET BOOK - A WAY OF LIFE,"In January 2000 I was diagnosed with Diabetes. I had the good fortune(?) of having friends who have experience with diabetes. They told me about this book (1996 edition). The information contained in this book is absolutely brilliant. The scientific research and proof about what your body does with different types of carbohydrates and the dispelling of the old myths is fascinating reading. All foods should come out with a GI factor listed on them now. Recipe books are finally starting to come out with GI listing for meals. One of those NEW books is called the ENJOY COOKBOOK, written by Sally James (ISBN 187662406X) which rates a meal by the GI factor of the ingredients. At least it would take the guess work out of knowing what's good and what isn't. Every home should have The Glucose Revolution : The Authoritative Guide to the Glycemic Index."
2,This book seems misleading,"The discussion is interesting although I'm suspicious of the repeated low fat advice, but am not really qualified to comment on it.However, I think the emphasis throughout most of the book on glycemic index rather than the glycemic load (the index adjusted for the amount of carbs in a portion) is extremely misleading.The authors mention this issue in some areas, but most of the book justs talks about the index without regard to portion size. They even recognize the issue with their discussion on carrots, but don't notice that their recommendations on pasta have exactly the same issue, but in the opposite direction. Spaghetti has a GI of 41, not too bad, but is very high in carbs, so it ranks in the 83rd percentile of all their listed food for total load. This is much higher than most potato dishes and breads for example.If the whole idea of glycemic effects means anything at all it has to take into account portion size."
2,Lacking in the whole picture,"I agree the glycemic index is a useful tool, but the attiudethat low fat diets are best remain in this book which I do not whollyagree with. [The book discusses] the media driven view that all dietary fats are harmful to health. This is not true. Some are (excess saturated fats, trans/hydrogenated fats.) but the health benefits of the good fats/essential fatty acids are not mentioned. I suggest picking up Udo Eramus' book ""Fat's that Heal, Fat's that kill"" and put the two books together to complete the picture between carbs. and fats. Eskimo's get 50-60% of their calories from fats (rich in omega 3/6) oils and don't get heart disease. The view [of this book] is still too skewed for me to justify this book."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book, hoping to find some really good diet information. What I found was inconsistent, and rambling. Perhaps there could be some good information for diabetics, but you have to look for it."
4,Have some of these reviewers even read this book?,"This is a book of explanation, not a fad weight-loss diet book. I am a borderline diabetic and found the information in this book to be extremely helpful and educational. As I applied the things I have learned in my effort to avoid full-blown diabetes, I also found I was losing weight.I learned a lot from this book and am grateful to the authors for the information. I find it very annoying to have the book slammed for not being the magic weight-loss gimmick some people are searching for. That is not what this book is about."
3,Difficult to Read,"I found this book too complicated to follow easily. There was good scientific evidence in it, but above the head of somebody without a chemistry degree."
3,Glucose Revolution,"This book offered a great explanation of how one's body processes food into energy, and how insulin levels affect your health. The glycemic index will become a new way of dieting and healthful eating, thanks to the ongoing studies. It takes what we already know about insulin levels to a new level. I was, however, disappointed in this book. As one that strives for a healthy lifestyle and is conscientious about my diet, I was offended by some of the side by side examples of a ""healthier diet"" sample. For example, instead of whole milk, use 1% milk. One example actually suggests you skip the donut - get real! Show me how I take what I believe to be a healthy diet today and move me to the next level by using the glycemic index! For those already comfortable with how insulin works in your body, skip the book - you can get the GI index from the internet. For those who are only beginning to think about a healthy lifestyle, this book might be worthwhile."
2,The Glycemic Index is the only reason to buy this book.,"This book contains the most complete Glycemic index of foods available, but those 14 pages are all it has to offer a person trying to lose weight. The dietary principles the author suggest are way off base. The statements about fat turning to fat and the need to cut back on protein just don't go along with the current scientific data. If you compare this book with ""Protein Power"", ""Atkins Diet"", or ""Sugar Busters"" you will find many problems with the authors concepts. Buy this book for the Glycemic Index and read ""Sugar Busters"" to learn how to use it."
2,Book's title is misleading.,"The book's title is very misleading. The title implies that it covers the entire workflow process, but it does not. The book provides some very interesting case studies, from the perspective of a working cinematographer, and if you're just interested in shooting digital, the content will be quite informative. If you are looking for some more specific information on the post production process, such as editing digital content, and distribution, I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
2,"Terrible, just terrible.","I'm taking a Geometry class at BCC and this is the required textbook. It's one of the worst textbooks I've had to use. The overall format of the lessons is okay, but everything is just...yeck. The point of a textbook is to be a learning resource but the exercises in the book are almost entirely different from the lessons and as the book gets to the more advanced level, it completely stops explaining theorems, just offering ""You can provide the reasons."" I've managed steady Bs on the tests throughout the course but for the life of me I can't figure out how to do any of the problems inside. If you're stuck with this book, BE SURE TO GO TO EVERY CLASS, because this useless stack of papers won't be offering any help.Also, the design inside the book is depressing."
3,"Great service, great people","Plane GeometryBy Earnest CampI ordered two of these books from 2 different bookstores, used. They both came pretty quick and in good shape, well worth the money. My problem was, I did not realize that the picticular book that we needed was only available at the Jr. College for $81.00. That it was exclusively made for Laney College in Oakland, CA, by the Author. My kids couldn't really use the editions that I got them through Amazon. Don't get me worng, I love going through Amazon, I have gotten other school text books before for my college classes.Thanks again and I will use your service in the future, because I think it is great!"
2,Terribly boring.,"I need not say more than those two words, but I will -- this book is just awful. I was expecting a real memoir, and this is just a piecemeal collection of boring anecdotes and pats on the back, combined with crabbiness about modern life. Dreadful! Give me Nancy's or Jessica's books, any day!"
4,witty and pithy,"The Duchess has that touch of Mitford wit that can also be seen in Nancy & Jessica's writings. Filled with pithy observations about aspects of life in Britain and history, I was laughing out loud at her recountments of ancestral adventures (brothers sharing one hotel room with a dead body, everyone crying at the birth of another girl) and encounters with the general public (""Saw the duchess in the garden, she looked quite normal.""; ""That's the Dowager Duchess. It was taken the year she died."")"
5,Charming tidbits from Debo,"Counting My Chickens . . . And Other Home Thoughts is a slender volume of musings and remembrances by Deborah Freeman-Mitford Cavendish, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire. Gathered from her published columns these are charming and insightful looks into the daily life and doings of a fascinating woman with a wonderful sense of humor. many may look to this volume to see if the youngest of the Mitford sisters; who were the toast of society and the literary world, shares their writing chops. She comments on family, her early life, the life she has chosen and the changes she has observed from a rarefied seat. She occasionally shows a glimpse of the waspish tongue that her sisters employed so well, but more often her words are fueled with insight and humor. This is not a tell-all or an autobiography. I found this book delightful and hope there are more."
4,Something Leather,"Alasdair Gray is an interesting an unique voice... This is a fun little book, but best to find one with his illustrations. He is at his best when he uses his art and words together. Try to find one of the British editions."
5,An in-depth archaeological study of medieval footwear,"Shoes And Patterns is an in-depth archaeological study of medieval footwear, made possible by preserved footwear of the 12th through 15th century discovered along the north bank of the river Thames and permanently housed in the collection of the Museum of London. The detailed and informative text is enhanced throughout this impressive work of archaeological and historical scholarship with numerous black-and-white photographs and drawings which make the shoes of centuries ago as real and practical as if they were worn today. An essential addition to academic Medieval History studies reference collections, Shoes And Patterns is particularly recommended reading for theatrical costumers, replica-makers, historical reenactors and anyone with a festive curiosity about this down-to-earth topic of medieval footwear."
5,Easy for EVERYONE,"I had never attempted yoga because the poses looked so intimidating. How could I ever get myself into those positions? But, I tried this series of tapes and found that ""perfection"" was not the key - only stretching as far as YOU can go. The instructor is wonderful with explanation and encouragement. I love doing these tapes and love how I feel afterwards. It has also helped my chiropractic treatments by strengthening the muscles surrounding the spine....helping the adjustments last longer.My husband and I do these tapes together frequently...often before going to bed. They are relaxing and give us both a better nights sleep. We are both in our 40's and do not do any other form of regular exercise.If you are interested in yoga, this set is wonderful. I just sent a set to my best friend and her husband for them to try!"
5,Still the BEST YogaZone series!,"I bought this collection on VHS back in...well, the late 90s. At the time, I was in a serious (ie, disabling) Fibromyalgia-myofasial pain syndrome-complex. All my life I've been active, an athlete, etc. and suddenly here I was struggling to get up the stairs of my building.This series gave me the kind of activity I needed-- and the encouragement to let my body just go as far as it could *that day*, and not push too far.I still use these programs in my daily routines, and although I have several other YogaZone dvds, this collection is still my favorite!If you're looking for ""power"" yoga, however, you won't be happy with this collection."
2,A very poor picture quality.,"Reading other reviews I did not find the content of the DVD to be a surprise. Thus, even though the presentation is very slow, the content met my expectations. HOWEVER, the picture of quality of the content is mediocre at best. As a result, rather than offer 4-5 stars, I can only justify 2-3 (closer to 2)."
3,Ok for some,This is ok for beginners. But not for those with a little weight to lose. I was trying to fit this into my schedule for weight loss and toning. Trying to start a new habit. I can't do a third of the positions because the belly gets in the way.
2,Not very impressed,"These DVD's are for people who have never ever done any yoga. They are very simplistic and they are broken into too short of segments. A 20 minute session is just not enough. Also, the poses are so simplistic it is as though you are just stretching instead of doing yoga. I feel that these tapes are too easy even for the most novice of yogis. For a better more complete introduction to yoga one might want to try Crunch yoga DVDs."
1,Not happy,"I was so excited try this yoga set - due to all of the very positive reviews I had read here on this site. I am thoroughly disappointed though. I found it to be very difficult to follow along - I knew absolutely nothing about yoga and I felt the instructor did not familiarize me enough with the basics of yoga before beginning. I have to say too, the instructors heavy accent made it very difficult to follow this as well.I can't recommend this to anyone - I am very disappointed."
5,WONDERFUL! Thank goodness for this set,"I love this set. I am a newbie to Yoga and a roll off the couch out of shape couch potato, who huffs and puffs just making the bed!This set is perfect. The pace is slow enough to follow along and not feel lost. Mr. Finger is a great teacher gently guiding you through without making it too complex. So far I have only watched the first DVD in the set but it's a perfect start for a couple months worth of building stamina, balance and strength.The Asana poses are perfect for beginners like myself who are brand new to yoga.I also bought 2 other DVD sets ""Yoga Journals Step by step set"" and ""Yoga for inflexible people"" and Yoga Zone is by far my favorite!"
5,The best for beginners,"I truly find Yoga Zone DVDs the best out there for beginners. Alan Finger's teaching is very thorough and proper allignment is very well explained. I have really enjoyed this set and have recommended it to friends who have wanted to begin yoga. Plus, Alan has such a great voice. A must for beginners!"
5,A well rounded collection,"This is a great collection of videos. I had practiced yoga in college, but had not practiced in a few years. This set was a great way to get back into it. This is a well balanced collection. Alan Finger does a great job of emphasizing breathing and only doing as much as you can. Each tape is an hour long, so you are getting the most for your money. I highly recommend these videos for anyone wanting to try yoga."
5,You'll be glad you bought it!,"I had never done yoga before and wanted to get started by purchasing a video. I read the reviews for this set and I echo all the positive feedback.I am a busy Mom of two toddlers and run my own home based business, hence ""my"" time doesn't begin until after 9pm every night. At that hour of the night an aerobic workout was not happening, but now I look forward to the nights I can do Yoga Zone.With the box set I have options each night and surprisingly I really enjoy the meditation video (I was a skeptic!).Alan Finger's voice is incredibly soothing and his explanations for each pose are very descriptive. I am confident that I am doing the poses correctly.I am reaping the benefits of better sleep, the perfect end to each day and total relaxation!"
3,my opinion,"I am a beginner in yoga, and I did enjoy the ""Introduction to Yoga"" tape. Personaly, I did not like what few psuedoscientific comments made by Master Alan Finger. I also could not find ""Meditation"" tape to be worth a while. The ""Conditioning and Stress Release"" tape and the ""Flexibility and Tone"" tape have many redundant instructions from ""Instruction to Yoga"". Again, I am being subjective as I review this tape collection. If you are just begining yoga, and just want something to start with, my suggestion is to get only the ""Introduction to Yoga"" tape."
3,"Nice production, poor quality transfer","It looks like these were transferred from VHS which is a pity because the productions themselves look very good. The quality of the sound is mediocre and there appears to be something wrong with the aspect ratio. Overall, probably (just) worth the low price."
3,Not the greatesty productions,"These productions are traditional, and at the price OK to have for lovers of G&S. But the productions are a bit dumbed-down. G&S should be played straight which emphasizes the wit, not slapstick which dumbs down the humor. The singing is OK, costumes and sets are OK. I would prefer to have DVDs of the D'Oyly Carte productions but can not find any."
1,Poor quality,The box set has such potential with the best of their works included... When we opened the first on - HMS Pinafore we were shocked at the poor quality of the recording. The sound was of such low standard that we had to turn up full ball to hear the words at which point it started distorting. The picture quality looked like it had been through the mill and back - very grainy and like it had been recorded back in the 70s. And every 30 seconds it would pause and then suddenly jump forward - such a disappointment!
5,Incredible toy!,"Honestly, out of everything that santa brought to our house this year, this toy was the biggest hit. If there was a way for my little guy to wear it to bed, he would. It's absolutely hysterical to see them flying around the house in this suit, muscles all pecked up with the attachd fan, etc. My son has a ton of fun with this thing and wears it all day long. It is very durable too - even takes to having food spilled on it. Amazon is having a tremendous bargain on it and for $5, it is well worth it. Highly, highly recommend!"
5,Lots of Fun!,"Even though my son has now lost interest in this as a daily source of enjoyment, for about 2 weeks he would spend about 45 mins - 60 mins just running around the house and yard. For the price of this and if your kid has any interest in superheros, you can't go wrong. My son still will grab this from time to time and use his imagination to it's fullest. It's definitely money well spent."
1,does not work as described,The fan would not inflate the item....we ended up putting tissue paper in it to look like it had muscles...not good at all...a great disappointment.
3,Liked it better in the ad,"My 4 year old was really excited by this. He saw the TV ad, asked me to order it, and put it on immediately. When Halloween came around and he'd had it on for a while, he deemed it too itchy at the neck closure and that was the end of that.That said, I thought it was extremely cute. The plastic construction is kinda cheesy, but seems to hold the air in. Whirring battery was relatively quiet."
1,Not what I thought it was,"My nephew was very excited when he saw the box and the picture. Unfortunately, the inflatable suit is not really inflatable. It requires constant air to keep it poofy looking. It is basically a costume that has elastic bands around the neck and wrists and requires a blower (battery operated) to blow airs in to keep it looking inflated. The battery is heavy and will not stay put on the two inch diameter hole on the back side of the thin vinyl suit. Everytime he moves, it pops out. The fan is noisy so he ran around in the clingy, deflated suit for a few minutes and begged to be let out of it as the elastic bands were restricting him. He loves superman and loves having a cape. He opted for a regular white towel over the thin red vinyl cape the costume came with.I suppose we got what we paid for. Cheap prices doesn't equate to quality. I felt like my nephew got only a couple of minutes out of this toy. Would not recommend it to anyone else... Unfortunately..."
3,Kindle version is flawed,"The content is fine on its own, but the format of the Kindle version leaves something to be desired. The artwork is missing (It appears as ""Artwork #2,"" for instance.), and line breaks are not handled properly."
1,Avoid This Edition,"The ""Mysteries of Light"" are a a novelty invented by John Paul II. The Rosary was given to us by Our Lady. Typical of the Novus Ordo: The arrogance of deciding that the prayer given to us by the Queen of Heaven needs ""change."""
5,"If you are a runner, wow on the energy","I was a bit apprehensive as I am not a naturalist; however, this does give you a prolonged energy bump. There are about a thousand foods that you can mix this with and the taste is great."
5,Pinole,Great supplement for pre workouts and works just as great during workout. Great taste and mixes really easy. Shipped fasted!
3,Too Sweet for Me - Tastes like Candy,"Tastes good, but I had expected something unsweetened that might have been healthier. Note: The sweeterner may have been mentioned in the advertisement I might have missed it. Fast accurate shipping/delivery. All packages intact upon receipt."
1,It's full of sugar,"The product description in Amazon is misleading. The description says ""Pinole Ground Corn"" and it even suggests adding brown or white sugar to it. But it is already full of sugar, which is exactly what I didn't want."
4,ace #32731 Jersey Pattern axe,"Did not receive axe shown as advertised,although did receive a Collins Jersey Pattern axe without the Phantom Bevels.This axe is a quality axe as cheeks are thinned out and the blade only needed minimal file work.The head is ground and clear coated.The handle is typical Collins Pattern.Overall an acceptable axe for the price.Received 4 stars,as did not receive axe pictured."
4,Good clean family film...GREAT TO SEE!,"I was so glad to see a film that they did not have to insert one swear word. That always ruins movies for me-like in ""Straight from the Heart."" This is a good clean film. The acting by the three main characters was pretty good...It was a good ""Hallmark"" movie. I found some of the acting a little lacking so gave it four stars.If you have read the book...don't expect this to be exactly the same. Not enough time to develop the plot. This is a good story in its own right, but is quite a bit different than the book.If you like a good clean family film with a heart touching story-this one is for you!"
1,Predictable,"This movie is very predictable. It is the same old tired story of hard luck that turns out great in the end. It is family friendly, but it does not grab you. There is no believable chemistry between the love interests and the acting is poor. Take the advice of another reviewer and rent this one before you buy."
2,If you have read the book...SAY NO!,"So, the book Hidden Places by Lynn Austin is AMAZING! This movie...not so much. If you have read the book do not watch this movie it is such a dissapointment! But read the book =)"
3,Good tale,Good tale but not quite there something missing in the acting but nice story and good time reproduction
4,Hidden Places,"I like sappy love stories so this fits right in to what I normally buy. I got this movie simply based on ""Customers Who Bought Items in Your Recent History Also Bought"" section on amazon.com and was happy I did"
2,Dissappointing,"I got this movie for my birthday I was looking for a clean Christian chick flick. I was dissapointed in what I got. While the most aspects of it were clean (except when she runs out to hug her boyfriend in a PLUNGING nightgown (in front of other guys) it was nothing like I expected. While the acting was well done the plot was very shallow, and never gave you a chance to feel the mood. I understand its hard to make movies, and while everything seemed properly exicuted, it was very UNsatisfying. :("
2,Can be DANGEROUS on a gas stove,"We've had this kettle over a year. We love the look of it and the fact that it heats water quickly and retains the heat a long time. However, it can be DANGEROUS on a gas stove. If you look at the design, you'll see why this happens -- if you put too much water in it, it won't whistle, it will instead boil over without warning; the water will boil out through the spout, run down the side, then under the kettle and douse the flame underneath. So the FLAME IS OUT but the GAS IS ON. This has happened several times. If you don't overfill it (above the spout), it's perfectly fine, but it's hard to keep reminding other people like guests and family. We've decided to replace it with a kettle that has a higher spout and a flat bottom."
1,Didnt Recv the book so far,"I have logged a complaint to the vendor, but no response from him. I havent received the book so far. Its been a month now."
1,Ridiculous pomo nonsense.,"I'm sure that there might be plenty who say that I'm too dull and logocentric, too ""Oedipalized"", to recognize the obvious profundity that lies in these pages. The intelligent reader, however, who does not confuse obscurity for insight, might think differently.I don't know what would possess someone to write about the ""postmodern animal"" - I really don't. So often in these pages it seems as though Baker has to read ""the postmodern animal"" into places it just doesn't seem to be. That is, whatever the hell the ""postmodern animal"" is. I'm not quite sure myself after trying to decipher this trendy gobbledegook.I guess I have to ""supply my own meaning"" or some other such hippy postmodernist platitude.What is happening to this world?"
4,Works as advertised,"Works great, only regret is you can't turn the mirror part long-ways (landscape) but it is very sturdy, yet flexible. Love that it doesn't vibrate all over the place."
5,Cycleaware Reflex Bicycle Helmet Mirror,"The helmet mirror is exactly what I hoped for. It is easy to install and has very strong adhesive. (like a car rear view mirror) I've been riding with the mirror for a couple of weeks now and instinctively notice cars coming from behind and warn the group when their is a ""car back"". Don't know why I waited this long to buy one."
1,Too small,"It's cumbersome to use, the mirror is too small, and its difficult to set up. I didn't like that, I prefer to have one fixed to my bike."
1,flimsy. fragile. small viewing area,"the mirror takes constant adjustment, has too small of a viewing area, and snapped off wile i was riding across a bridge, and is now in the potowmac river.the attachment to the helmet and flexible wire are pretty quality, thoughis there really is a durable helmet mirror... with maybe a convex lens?"
1,Save your money!,Base wouldn't even stay stuck to helmet. Mirror should pivot 90 degrees to holding shaft to maximize distance from eye. Threw it out and am looking for another.
2,Not good,Let me start with the mirror quality. Its bad. Its some reflective coated plastic which if you try to clean by rubbing will become very dull and unusable in night conditions.Then the mechanism for holding it is poor. adjusting the mirror to view the rear is pretty tricky and by the time you get it showing the rear view the ball and socket holding the mirror will become so loose that every time you encounter some road vibration you have to adjust it. The rest of the part is good. The arm holds on to the helmet. But due to its very poor mirror quality and mechanism I will not recommend anybody to buy it. Its a bad product.
1,Absolute crap,"Bought this product a week ago and got in in two days. Fast shipping but that the only good thing. It was easy to attach but felt cheap. The mirrorkept popping out of the ball socket during adjustment and on my first ride with it today i was not even a mile into my ride and the mirror just fell out of the socket never to be seen again. Not worth the $20 i spent on it (w/shipping) maybe if they made it more secure it would work better. I ride at an average speed of 15-15mph depending on the route I take and this to cheap to withstand that wind... what a pile-o-crap. Got my replacement yesterday and rode with it thia morning. The small mirror seems too small to quickky focus on. And it slowly went out adjustment as I rode. I suppose with no wind, and zero head movement maybe it would stay in place."
5,Smart Solution to Rear View Problem,"This mirror works for me. Attached it to my helmet after roughing up a spot with sandpaper. The mirror is easy to adjust, gives an excellent view of what's behind you and stays put. Good price and rapid delivery. Have tried several different brands and this one is the best so far."
5,Great helmet-mounted mirror!,"This is a great cycling rearview mirror, especially for the price. It takes a few miles to get used to, but then after that it's second nature! Easy to install and adjust, and stays in place fairly well."
1,Returned it the day I got it.,"The mirror is TINY. I mean really, really tiny.Admittedly, I've never owned a mirror like this before, so maybe this is the norm for cheap ($10-$15) mirrors, but it's not something I felt comfortable using. I could barely see anything unless it was directly behind me. I thought the point of these mirrors was to get a good sweeping view behind you. This mirror definitely didn't provide anything close to ""sweeping.""I ended up returning it the same day that I got it. I ended up purchasing a different mirror:Safe Zone Bicycle Helmet MirrorIt's quite a bit more expensive, but I'm considering this life-saving equipment.When I get it I'll post a review and let you know if it lived up to my expectations."
3,Didn't work with my helmet,"I received the mirror as a gift (from my Amazon wish list). I was in the process of converting my commuter bike to trekking handlebars, so I could no longer use my bar-end mirror. The helmet mount looked like a good replacement. The product is well-made, but the mounting pad had to be on a fairly flat section of my helmet that resulted in the mirror being much too close to my eye and basically unusable. If your helmet is a different design, you might not have this problem. I returned it for credit (a little tricky since I'd already used the adhesive mount...but Amazon allowed it after several emails). And then I ordered the Zefal Spy mirror. It uses a strong elastic band to mount on the handlebar, and it worked great for my application.Zefal Spy Bicycle Mirror"
2,Good mirror but poor attachment design,"The adhesive design on this product is terrible. Bought 3 of these and all of them ended up having a problem with the adhesive. In trying to peel off the paper protecting the adhesive on one of them, the adhesive and a layer of foam came off at once. On the other two, the adhesive protector was difficult to get off without pulling off the foam but I did manage to get it off OK. Once attached to the helmet, the adhesive separated from the the foam on the other two and the fixture came off the helmet. To correct this problem, I had to scrape away all the foam layers on the fixture and use epoxy to glue it to the helmet. Once this was done, the fixture stayed and the mirror works great. Be prepared to have the same problem."
1,Wasted $20 - Poor Design!,"The mirror attaches to the arm by a small ball joint, which is very loose. It was stiff enough to hold the mirror steady while riding, but it was loose enough to very easily pop right out of the socket when lightly bumped with a hand while wiping my brow. It popped out several times, and each time, I was lucky enough to find the mirror part on the ground and pop it back in, until this morning. I have no idea where the mirror went to when it popped out, and now I'm left with a useless $20 plastic arm attached to my helmet. Very poor design. I wish I had read the bad reviews before purchasing this."
4,You Must Add Your Ingenuity,"This mirror works great. Problems may arise but they are easily solved.I've had one of these for years -- two actually, because one broke in a crash.1. The joint holding the mirror may get loose over time so that the mirror shifts in the wind or when jostled. You can easily fix this by buying a very small wire tie, and tightening it around the joint.2. The adhesive may fail. If so, glue it onto the helmet yourself with JB Weld glue.3. The bendable arm may fail. Some soft wire and glue can fix this.4. The mirror might get scratched. You can buff it out with brass polish.The first three problems occurred with my first mirror, but only after years of use."
2,"Excellent design, materials are poor quality!","This mirror is quite effective in that you can see behind you without having to turn your head. The problem is, the sticky pad where the mirror attaches to your helmet, doesnt' hold up. Then, the mirror, after a few century rides in the sun, seems to ""oxidize"" to the point you can't see out of it anymore.Conveniently, Cycleaware sells a ""mirror replacement parts kit"" with a new mirror and new sticky pad. What a scam! If they would sell a quality mirror in the first place, you wouldnt need a replacement kit. You can see it here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TIKSBS/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00It's also worth mentioning that I've only had the mirror for about 3 months, and I've already had to buy their replacement kit. If you can find another mirror that works for you, I suggest you go with that one."
2,"Functionally OK, but flimsy construction",I've had two of these and both failed in the stem area after 3-4 months of fairly heavy use. Had to glue to the helmet with contact cement.Worked pretty well until the stem failures. Mirror should be a little larger.
1,Cycleware Bike Mirror,The Cycleaware Bike Mirror I got has not worked out very well. It was vibrating pretty much and made using it difficult and unsafe. Then a few days ago the mirror part fell off. I have no way of knowing where or attempting to find it. I hope this mirror was not the norm for this item.
3,Works well for a little while,"What works well: 1) Mounting. I've mounted these mirrors to a multitude of helmets over the years with no problems. 2) Field of view. I can see clearly and the oval shape provides a much more useable image size than do round mirrors. 3) Adjustability. I can put the mirror right where I want it regardless of helmet shape or which bike I'm riding at the time. 4) Cleanable surface. The mirror cleans easily without scratching. What needs improvement: Just one item - the ball-and-socket connection between the mirror and the arm. This has been the point of failure on all of these mirrors for me and it comes much too soon, usually after one season or less of riding. The pros outweigh the cons, however, and I'm ordering another one now."
2,Nice mirror if you have the right kind of helmet,"It's a great little mirror, but won't stick to my helmet. You need a flat area about two inches square, where you want to mount it. Also, the glue failed to stick to my plastic hard shell helmet. I would guess it's fine for styrofoam helmets."
2,Mirror snaps off too easily - arm not long enough,The mirror falls off the arm way too easily and the arm seems like it needs to be longer. I find myself straining to see the mirror.It does attach well to my trek road bike helmet and I like that it can be easily be removed from the helmet but even the arm connection to the helmet seems to be too loose.
5,Excelentes,"Excelentes Cables de audio, mantienen el sonido sin distorsión. Realmente muy Buenos.Excellent Cables of audio, they maintain the sound without distortion. Really very Good."
2,used item?,"Okay, I ordered this cable and was surprised to see that it was used. It was in a plastic bag and there are already so many marks on the cable itself. The quality of Monsters is okay, but I'm not sure what's up with Amazon on this. I don't think that this is acceptable to send out used item to customers. Was this a mistake? I hope not, but it doesn't look like it. I'll contact Amazon for a replacement. Other than that, the cable is good quality as it's monsters."
5,"Excellent, could not put this book down!","If you like well researched true crime, read this. I hung on every word and was not disappointed."
3,Not the best book ever,"I'm kind of stumped as to why so many people rated this book so highly. I found it repetetive and dull, especially toward the middle. There were several chapters that spoke of nothing but the debate about whether to give Pomeroy the death penalty or life in jail, with wordy letters written by various opponents and/or supporters. I thought it could have been wrapped up in a couple of chapters, maybe, but it went on and on and finally I skipped a few chapters to get to the end. Another thing I disagreed with was the description of Pomeroy as a serial killer. He only killed 2 people, I hardly call that serial killing. Not that he wasn't a deviant of the worst kind, I just think the description was meant more for sales of the book that an accurate analysis of what the little freak was."
3,It was ok I guess,"It was about 25 pages to long in my opinion. The author liked using a lot of news paper articles from that time and I thought it was a little over done with those. It all seemed to just be a lot of ""Fluff"" to get the book to over 300 pages. Over all though it was pretty good."
4,Riveting (now all the pages are there),"DrinkingCaroline KnappSelf Help - Recovery | DeltaTrade Paperback | May 199714.95 | 0-385-31554-6This is an update since writing the review below this one: Well, Amazon replaced the book with the missing pages and I have been amazed how riveting and absorbing the book is. The writer really knew how to draw you into her story and whether you are a drinker, an addict or just curious I sincerely recommend it as an educational and helpful read. If I were to place any criticism, it would be that some of the narratives ramble on in flowery or overly verbose descriptions, but still I would strongly recommend it as a good read.(Following is the old review before Amazon kindly replaced the book) I bought the book titled above for myself and a friend. On starting to read my copy I discovered that pages 17 to 48 are missing and replaced with pages 225 to 256. These pages are also in the right place later in the book thus duplicating them"
5,a must read for women alcoholics,I enthusiastically recomend this book for women who are in recovery or know a female alcoholic. Each page was a new discovery. I have attended many meetings over the years but have never felt like someone else did all of the things I did. I had such a relief knowing that I was not the only one who behaved this way. I have bought several copies of this book and given them to my friends in AA and Alon. Highly recomended.
3,Disturbed My Serenity,"""Drinking: A Love Story"" is a well-written book, but when I tried to read it at nine years sober, I found it profoundly disturbing. I only read the first three or four chapters before I put it down.Had I been in the first three years of sobriety when this book was published, I probably would have loved it and related to it. Many of my fellow travelers thought it was wonderful.Unfortunately for me, I found the book to be a drunk-a-log."
3,Story of a crazy bore.,"Is this your average alcoholic? An incredible background with that blind menacing half-wit brother who tried to kill her as a baby, her father's first alkie wife howling in the background, her apathetic father, and a twin sister! No mention of whether she was an identical twin or fraternal. and that habit she had until she was 16 of getting down on all fours and rocking for hours in her room. I think Caroline was probably schizophrenic. People do love to imagine all alcoholics are like her. Was Pete Hamill just a better writer or was this woman nuts from the git go?"
2,Relationships,"This book is for women who enjoy reading about relationships, in repetitive, excruciating, detail. Her mother, father, sisters, girlfriends, boyfriends, etc. etc. and her drinking. Guys will find this hard to keep open."
2,There are TWO As in AA . . .,". . . unfortunately the author apparently only learned the first one. Sure, she's an ""A""lcoholic, but AA really works because of the second ""A."" It's an ""A""nonymous program that has a public relations policy that is based on attraction rather than promotion; one that places principles before personalities. It also requires personal anonymity ""at the level of press, radio, and films."" If she's supposed to be so smart, why didn't Caroline K understand the Traditions of AA?"
2,Better if there was more on recovery...,"Many have discussed this book's ""eye opening"" experience. However, where's the meat on discussing what it's like to ""recover"" ???? That, ladies and gentlemen, is the very, very hard part about alcoholism and getting over the drink. This book brushes over that aspect in only a few pages and treats alcoholism as if ""once the problem is recognized and acknowledged, the hard part's over.""This would have been a far better book if would have spent as much time talking about ""recovery"" as it did in its indulgent self-appraisal of what the ""drinker"" actually experiences. While I recommend it for folks who may need a kick in the pants to recognize the problem, dealing with alcoholism once it's there is far, far...far...more difficult. Perhaps there's a book in that concept all by itself..."
5,"I found Carolyn's book enlightening, engrossing and poignant","From the first page I found Drinking, A Love Story riveting. I appreciated the authors honesty and intelligence, her insights and vulnerability. The book caused me to re-evaluate my drinking habits and more than once had me sit up in my chair in recognition of myself in some insight of the authors. Her observtions on women and addiction in the form of anorexia rang so true with me it hurt. Throughout the book I cared about this person and was sad to finish it because I felt I was ending not just the book, but losing a new friendship."
5,Stylistically written,"Wonderful literary tour-de-force on a difficult topic makes this confessional one of the best memoirs ever about alcoholism. Just when you think things can't get worse, the author ends her chapters by noting things such as it took her five more, ten more etc, years before she finally quit. A great read all around."
5,"Excellent Memoir, great writing","This is one of my favorite memoirs, both for its difficult subject matter and the quality of writing. I couldn't stop reading this book and have since sought out other titles by the author.From the opening chapter you've drawn into the day-to-day obsession of addiction which, in the case of this author, is insidious despite its somewhat mundane appearance. Once she's brought you to the heart of addiction its easy to see how such a creeping and at first seemingly harmless relationship to alcohol can quickly go from social aid to problem crutch to full-blown need.In one of the most thought-provoking parts of the book she compares drinking, or any sort of addiction really, with exaggerated procrastination - an interesting take on addiction that still has me thinking.A must-read."
4,You Booze..You Lose,"Great memoir. Nicely written from a female perspective. For a male perspective...check out, ""PERAMBULATIONS"" by C.S. Back. I liked this one too. Very well written, honest and real. Bravo...."
4,An Excellent description of alcoholism for everyone,"As a non-alcoholic, this book has helped me more than anything else to finally comprehend what life is like for an alcoholic. From the first page, when Knapp describes in stark detail her utter love and devotion to a bottle of wine, I was riveted. I never understood that you could love a bottle of booze like you could love a person (or, in her case at times, more so). Her struggle is so deep, that when she finally decides to get help, the reader just wants to stand up and cheer. I have never seen alcoholism described in such stark, emotional terms. She should be commended."
4,Interesting,This was a very interesting account into the world of alcoholism. I thought I may have a problem with alcohol (drinking 2 to 3 glases of wine @ night) until I read this book! Good read.
2,Didn't like it.,This book was a selection for our book club. It seemed like a promotional book for AA. I forced myself to finish it.
2,"OK, I get it.","Although the book is very insightful and makes one think about his/her drinking habits, after you have heard the same points made over and over for 120 pages or so, you think, ""OK, I get it, now get on with it."" What the author took almost 300 pages to say could have been done in considerably fewer. Augusten Burroughs book ""Dry""makes many of the same points, but is much more interesting. Maybe its just that his life was so much more bizarre, but he certainly doesn't beat you to death with the same statements throughout the book."
2,A blah book,"The book is interesting because the author writes well about the subject, but then it just keeps repeating the same point over and over...shes a closet alcoholic and its so hard to stop drinking and so on and so on. I didn't even bother to read to the end; the ending was so predicatable, she would stop drinking. Maybe I wasn't so keen on the book because I do not know what it feels like to be an alcoholic and I can't relate, but this book lost my interest after the first 70 pages."
3,Self-absorbed and ultimately boring,"While not totally uninteresting, I've read it before. It got on my nerves how Knapp kept going on about being intelligent, special, from a fine family, etc., etc. For a book that's supposed to be revealing, she remains oblivious to others' relationship with her"
4,"Sad, but true","Hard to say it was ""a fun read"" when the subject matter is so sad. It so reminded me of someone in my life who went through the same thing. It did give me a clear picture of how a woman who is sliding down that path thinks."
5,extremely valuable book to read about self discovery,"I think this is perhaps one of the most important books tobe written on the topic of alcoholism and self-discovery. It isdeeply moving to see how she built her life around alcohol andthen to see her dismantle that dependence. It took a lot of couragefor her to ""come out"" this way and she is to be commended for it."
4,Compelling new perspective,"I enjoy reading memoirs on subjects I know nothing about. Alcoholism was one of those topics. I thought that you could just stop drinking, but it's like telling a depressed person to stop being depressed; it doesn't work that way. I also stereotyped alcoholics as people that didn't function on a normal everyday basis and had to struggle to do so. But this book was very enlightening into a world I knew nothing about. Alcoholics are college graduates, hold down prestigious jobs, come from upper middle class families and go to work everyday, without people knowing about their addiction. They're not all homeless or living in squalor. While this may sound obvious, it was new to me, Caroline Knapp writes about her experience with alcoholism in a way that it's easy to understand without being too fundamental or boring."
4,Honest and finely crafted!,"I honor Ms. Knapp for exposing her life in such a way that illuminates the denial and distortion that accompanies this disease. I thought it was extremely well written and unsparing prose. I recommend this book to anyone who has battled with this overpowering addiction. Knapp has real talent, and I hope she remembers that when she reads some of the praise that she's received."
1,"Monotonous, Whining review of a downhill slumping life","It might give us a peek into the life of an alcoholic, but there are much better books that do so. Knapp goes over, and over, and over, and over what went wrong without elaborating. She glosses over important facts like her subsequent anorexia. Knapp writes really well when it comes to her fictional Life of Alice K. or anything she contributes to magazines and the Boston Phoenix, but, hey, if you want to learn about alcoholism, find a better book. Any one of them would do. Reading this book (I had to for a Psychology Class) was utter torture. Don't put yourself through it."
1,Drove me to drink,"I'm sure Knapp's problems would be juicy and interesting, if she would just be a little more direct in telling them. As it is, she relies too much on phrases like, ""Most alcoholics will tell you"" and ""When you're an alcoholic ... you do this and that."" We've all heard what alcoholics do and don't do by this time. Knapp does a wonderful job in tiptoeing around the specifics of her own problems and incidents. I hope she is more open than this at her meetings."
2,"Drinking = A Love Story, Boooring!!","As an adult child of an alcoholic, I bought this book trying to get insight into my father's alcoholism. I didn't. I kept reading and reading, trying to absorb what the writer was saying and I got nowhere. All I read was a litany of occasions where the author drank, what she drank, who she was with and whether or not she slept with them.There were times I felt I was reading an advertisement for cognac or other alcoholic beverages. I really wonder how this book should be catergorized, biography, self-help, or perhaps a skinny door stop. Don't waste your time."
1,Complete lack of understanding...,"She clearly did not understand or practice AA. This book is in direct conflict with the traditions and intent of AA, and thus, I suggest no one buy it. I wish I had not purchased. it, as a respectful, recovering alcoholic. An incredible misrepresentation of AA. Therefore, as a review of the book, it lacks credibility, integrity, and comprehensive substance. Save your time and money."
1,Whiny drivel to the Nth power.,"This book utterly lacks any note of credibility. It reads like someone's loony fantasy notion of how 'cool' and 'special' it would be to be seen as a 'recovering alcoholic' -- someone who thus receives full lifetime membership in the ""I'm damaged goods, therefore I am"" club. It's also another symptom of the cancer on the publishing industry: books about nothing more than the author's dreary, vapid life. When are writers going to start writing about subjects worth knowing about and stop taking self-serving advantage of the public's appetite for these cheesy McBooks?"
3,"Sharp appreciations, but poor plot.","Although I was quite disappointed with the story's plot, I found one of the best character composers today and, most importantly, a woman that converts tiny little things of ordinary life ( imperceptible for most of us, most of the time) in events of extraordinary importance, in events that deserve a lot of thinking and reflection.How can such a writer perform poorly in the most important, central part of any novel (its plot)? Well, I don't have an answer for that dilemma."
2,"Once you've heard 3 minutes, you've heard it all","Like all of Van Sickle's music, Climbing the Mountain features a gorgeous, other-worldly melody that is repeated, and repeated, and repeated, and repeated, with almost no progression or variation. There are so many obvious progressions and variations that COULD make this CD absolutely magical. Instead, it's as if the choir sang for several minutes and was then sent home, leaving the engineers to loop the same content until the CD was full."
3,ehh...alright i guess.,"This ring is not a horrible or anything of the kind. The stone is vibrant but fake. The siver celtic designs are slightly thick for my tastes. When recieving this ring, be well aware that you have bought a ring costing 8.99 and that is the quality of the work on it. Don't expect more than you ask for."
1,Good example of wild Afrocentrism,"If Africans were ocean-going explorers, how come they never discovered and settled islands off the coast of Africa - doh! And if they had the expertise to cross the Atlantic, why they didn't develop extensive coastal trading routes, or even with Europe for that matter - doh! And if they had the ability to build ships large enough to cross the Atlantic, why this technology (or evidence of it) is not still around on the west African coast - doh! And how come no African legends speak of discovering America, like the Viking accounts of Vinland - doh! A bad book, fit for clowns."
3,Olmecs Were Probably Just Indians.,"Most people would probably agree that at first glance the Olmec heads do resemble the faces of some Black Africans. Yes they do, but when compared to the faces of Mexican area Indians,there's also a similarity between them and the Olmecs stone heads. Van Sertima in another book on the same subject,uses the seven braids on the back of one of the Olmec heads as proof of their Africanism,but you will have a hard time finding an ancient Egyptian or Nubian match for this. Most paintings and sculptures of ancient Egyptians and Nubians with braids,usually show them with full headed braid styles,and not with just seven braids. So far no Olmec heads have been found with a full headed braid style like the Egyptians and Nubians. Also,multiple braids weren't uncommon with some ancient Indians. They have been found on the Andes mummies. People shouldn't be so quick to rule out the obvious posibility that the Olmecs stone heads do depict Indians."
1,So Native Americans Couldn't Do Anything Themselves?,"what kind of racist, afrocentric babble is this? this book relies on information and so-called ""proof"" that has absolutely no basis. For instance, those olmec heads don't look negroid at all. for some reason, maybe for a racist reason, van sertima leaves out that the olmec heads have flat faces and the epicanthic fold over the eyes. two characteristics that are present in native americans and asians but ABSENT among africans! to ivan van sertima i say, leave the native americans alone. this must hurt you to hear me say this, but native americans built their OWN civilization without any outside help."
4,Short and sweet,Hello I`ll get right to the point.We all no that this books importantfor the simple fact blacks are victimsof a powerful domanating race that wantsto control the world example when christwalked the earth he was the best thing thatevery happend in the history of man kindbut he was looked down on mistreated stonedspit at called names and denied. So its the sameway with the blacks because the good and the children ofthe kingdom of heaven will suffer much pain beforeentering the gates of heaven.
3,They Came Before Columbus,"Interesting book with some very good information, this type of information should be part of the school curriculum."
3,The Olmecs May Just Be Indians After All.,"Most people would probably agree that at first glance the Olmec heads do resemble the faces of some Black Africans. Yes they do, but when compared to the faces of Mexican area Indians,there's also a similarity between them and the Olmecs stone heads. Van Sertima in another book on the same subject,uses the seven braids on the back of one of the Olmec heads as proof of their Africanism,but you will have a hard time finding an ancient Egyptian or Nubian match for this.

They have been found on the Andes mummies. So people shouldn't be so quick to rule out the obvious posibility that the Olmecs stone heads do depict Indians."
3,Informative but opinionated,"I was looking for a factual representation on the history of Africans in America before Columbus which the author produced. However, the author's personal inferences are too lengthy and add little to the quality of the content."
5,National Geographic Only Does Facts,"If you don't wanna accept your African ancestory, your loss. National Geographic has the proof that you are looking for. Face it, the first Jews were Ethiopian and Jesus was black. Moses was a Pharoah of Egypt and he is the father of civilization. Remember in the Bible when Moses reached into his boosum and it turn white as snow, he did it once again and it returned to it's original color. Anyone opposed to the notion, the fact, the documents that point to African roots is in total denial, and you will find out, on that fateful day of judgement when you ask a black man for entrance into heaven."
1,Sad,"I have a PhD in Political Science - I am absolutely shocked that a reviewer below argues that because a book receives negative comments it must be right! What type of cack-handed logic is that? Fact: Van sertima's book has NO credibility because he has NO evidence. It would be amazing and good if someone discovered EVIDENCE of ocean-going Africans. Unfortunately, no has yet and as a person below points out, if islands just off the coast of Africa remained undiscovered and unknown to people on the African mainland, it kind of spoils the thesis that Africans built ocean-going ships that took them across the Atlantic to Africa. Can we have thoughtful comments on this book and not puffed-up and embarrassing nonsense based on misplaced racial pride and a need for building up self-confidence? African people can do that fine without resorting to lies and story-book fables."
4,Great read on an alternative view of history!,"This book is stimulating on an additional or alternate view of history! There is evidence found particularly in South America which support Van Sertima's claims listed in this book.What is unfortunate yet predictable are the nasty one-star remarks made by some of the reviewers below. EVERYONE, take note and read much of the hate-filled racist literature also available on Amazon.com starting with KKK member David Duke's My Awakening. I will bet many of the one-stars will give Duke and his pseudo-intellectual counterparts 5-stars! Whereas Van Sertima is mere speculation the Duke's are outright lies and distortions of truth.Don't be intimidated, Van Sertima! Anything you write is wonderful and thought-provoking!"
3,Ancient decendents,"Just got it a short tome ago. Some of which I remember from previous studies, some new knowledge gained. Overall a good informative read, though gets a bit wordy for this reader at some points."
1,20 anaversary colection RMM,I like to see the band play and the singer singing not lip singing I spend some money to hear old songs> I am very disappointed with this DVD.
3,Monteverdi used 'cornets'?!,"Though I have not listened to this particular CD of Monteverdi's Madrigali guerrieri et amoroso, I'm certain that cornets, the modern small brass instrument used in marching bands would not be appropriate. A cornett (or cornetti) the Renaissance wind instrument, made of wood and covered in leather, was used by Monteverdi, and would be quite appropriate, and I think that is what is being used in the CD."
5,Love it!,My husband put the chair together for me and said it was very simple. This is very sturdy. Has great options for the amount of recline and I love the tray that can come out on either side. I def. recommend some type of cushion for it. I've already spent many hours enjoying it in the month I've owned it.
5,"Beautiful wood, easy assembly and the perfect addition to my growing group.","I was afraid to order these chase lounges online but the price was so good, I went for it. I haven't regreted doing so at all. I have ordered two additional chairs since. They just arrived and are sitting on my Kiawah Island deck looking all pretty. They are the perfect chairs for sitting and watching the world go by. I will order more soon."
4,Strathwood Basics Hardwood Chaise Lounge,"We bought this for my husband as a fathers day gift. He is just under six feet and 190 pounds. He loves it and when I need to find him, I know where to look!"
2,Not happy with the return/exchange policy,"When I received this chaise lounge the wheel axle was broken. This is my first experience with the Amazon return and exchange procedure and it's really a pain. First, I am asked to return the whole package while I just need a replacement for the broken part. Second Amazon is asking me for a credit card number to validate the exchange and I don't understand why (I didn't use a credit card for my purchase). Third, there is no easy way to get in touch with a sales representative to clarify the procedure."
3,Lounge Chaise Chairs,"Chairs are great, however the screws and holes for the screws were not align. It is easy to assemble but just minor defects.. THank you."
1,dont buy this unless you're a woodworker,"this lounge, apparently made by a shell company because there is no corporate listing for ""Strathwood"", was made in Vietnam and reflects sub-standard production. Many of the pre-drilled holes do not line up with their mates, a couple so bad that I had to fill the holes with dowels and then re-drill them. The hardware is in metric sizes and the puny allen wrenches are not strong enough to tighten up misaligned connectors, so I had to dig up some metric tools to finish the job. I contacted Amazon and told them the product was sub-standard and that they should be ashamed of themselves for selling stuff like this to average customers who would not have the knowledge or the tools to adequately assemble it. Their response was, ""sorry, we'll take it back if you want to return it."" I expected at least a price adjustment in view of the extra work that was created, but that was not going to happen. So - buyer beware!"
4,Strathwood Chaise Lounge,Lounge is great for laying totally flat. Assembly can be trying as holes are not drilled properly for alignment during assembly. Packaging EXTREMELY damaged upon arrival - responsibility of manufacturer or shipper unknown. Could sit up one more notch for reading comfort. Moves easily around pool deck due to attached wheels and built in hand holds.
1,Very bad quality Chaise Lounge. I don't know how give 1 star :(,Very bad quality in all way. Be careful when you are lay down because is falling in part easily. I got this year and have been used four time but I don't think this chaise will survive to use next year.
3,"2x chaise lounges $200, new deck due to stains ???","Pros:- Easy to assemble- Actually seems like quality construction- Looks goodCons:- Stained my deck around the pool (cool-crete), who knows how much damage that is but much more than these chairs are worth. Not sure how to prevent this, maybe sealing them immediately? Seems like something the manufacturer should do instead of the buyer who expects a finished product.update after a 3-4 weeks: Once chair now has cracked in several spots around the main frame, the other has no major cracks."
4,"Very nice, but when it rained...","We put this on our patio and when we got our first rain it stained the concrete, but I haven't tried to clean it yet. other than that they are really cool. I would maybe wash them before you put them out."
4,Great Lounge,"We got our lounge faster than we expected and I went right to work putting it together. It wasn't too painful. We love it. The one thing I wish it had was armrests. The book/drink tray is very handy.We bought it without a cushion. If you buy one, make sure it's dense. Otherwise you will feel the wood.Highly recomend this product.California Son"
5,Strathwood lounger is excellent craftsmanship,"This is a very well-made lounger. The wood is beautiful and smooth, and it was easy to put together."
4,"Lovely Lounge, huge pain to assemble!","The chair is very nice. Sturdy and beautiful. My only complaint is that it was a huge pain to put together. I am pretty good at putting furniture together, but this was a horror! The instructions are worse than IKEA. None of the holes lined up easily, it took over 1 hour to assemble just 1. I bought 2, but the next 1 will have to wait for another day...I am exhausted!"
4,Great Chaise Lounge,"Very impressed with the quality and price. Like the pull-out table. Great for holding drinks, books, glasses, phone within easy reach. My husband wants 'arms' on the next one I buy but this one is great for laying down flat or even just relaxing in it, sitting up."
2,Nice wood but insufficient hardware,"I purchase two chaise lounges for my sister's birthday. We received them in time to celebrate a milestone birthday, but were unable to complete the assembly due to missing hardware items.Unfortunately, Amazon, ""Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company"" hasn't been helpful either."
5,Very good,"Easy to assembly, excellent quality, very good finish and this is the best price. Completely satisfied."
2,Some damage,"Overall I am very please with the chaise lounge, but I would just point out that there was some damage (cracking) on the foot rest.Rather that going through the inconvenience of repacking and sending it back, my husband, glued and clamped it.The appearance is not as good, but with a cushion on the top it doesn't notice."
1,"Poor Quality, falling apart in less than 1 season",I bought two of these chairs in the spring. One of the two chairs is absolutely falling apart. The wood is splitting in three different spots. The water now collects in these splits in the wood which will certainly lead to a quick death. I realize these chairs are priced very low compared to a Frontgate lounger but I think you get what you pay for. I would not suggest anyone buy these chairs.
2,chaise lounge,"not so great. Very uncomfortable. I also purchased the cushion and the cover that go along with it. The cushion is supposed to be mold free, but it does get moldy despite the cover. I would not recommend it. I have no way to return it either as we were not home when it was delivered, and by the time we got home, it was too late."
4,Great,The chairs are great! It is hard to find a cover going on them without it being $50 or more... the chairs are very good looking though and fairly easy to put together
5,Very nice piece.,"I just got it, but I think that it looks great on my deck. So far I only used it once and just loved it. The side table is very useful. I am very happy with this product."
2,Small people used indoors,"Sized for small people or children. All wood construction won't hold-up to high U.V. exposure or direct contact with soil or grass. Even with annual coating of teak oil, high sun areas will eat this lounger in three years time."
3,look good but not comfortable.,Thought these chairs were going to be an asset to our pool and bought 3 of them. They look nice from afar but very uncomfortable even with the cushions I bought which is another review. And from reviews new it was gonna happen. The underneath slide out tables are stuck underneath. Wish I had the sense to buy one on a trial basis before getting 3!
3,product review,I'm still waiting for the pad that I ordered along with the chair.If I had known they were going to be shipped seperately I would never have purchased them
3,If you enjoy projects order this.,"We ordered this Chaise lounge and I am really happy with it. However, there are no care instructions. When you go to the page that it directs you to go for those instructions, there are no instructions, just more products to buy on Amazon.com by the same company.It took my husband, who is very handy, four and a half hours to glue back all the slats that had popped out during shipping and put it together.IF those issues have been resolved by the time that you read this, get this lounger. Very comfortable with a cushion!"
4,"Pretty well made, holding up so far, and looks are great","SO far, these have been pretty high quality chairs. Love the sliding drink shelf. UPS ruined 1 of them, but goood old amazon replaced it. THanks amazon."
3,Good chaise...bad finish,"Overall a good solid run of the mill chaise lounge. Had one before without issue. However, be very wary as a good hard rain will cause the finish to bleed. We just ruined our brand new patio by purchasing two of these chaise lounges. If you are putting the out in the lawn...no worries. If placing them on natural stone, pavers, concrete or other nice materials...be prepared for headache. Finish runs off and looks exactly like rust stains on concrete...get the picture?"
1,"Stain, stain go away!",We got the chair and thought it was great - until it rained for several days straight and our new brick patio is the color the chair once was. How in the heck do you get stain out of coarse brick?!?!? It's still raining...
2,Lovely to look at...until it rains!,"We purchased these two teak finish chaise lounges because the price was very affordable compared to others we had seen. They assembled well and looked great, until the first rainfall. The orange stain dripped off the chaise lounges all over our white pool deck. It looked as if they were ""melting"". We had to use a high powered pressure washer to remove the stain from our deck. Unfortunately, they still drip onto the deck each time it rains, a little less stain each time. We can only hope that eventually it will stop completely. As I said, they look great, but alas a bargains isn't always a bargain!"
1,Very Poor Quality,"Slats in this chair fell off when I was putting it together. On top of that the assembly process was problematic because drill holes were not aligned. Shame on Amazon for such poor quality products. As a long-standing customer, I really expected them to at least meet the grade. Strathwood brand now stand s for waste of money."
4,A bit small...,"I just received and assembled this lounge, which is very reasonably priced. The main problem is that it's a bit short -- I'm only 5'6"" and my feet definitely are at edge of the chaise, so it wouldn't work for taller people. Also having arms would be preferable. Otherwise the lounge looks great and I look forward to using it for years to come."
3,Needing Parts,"It has held up fairly well, but the wheels are cracked. ANY HELP ON WHERE TO ORDER NEW ONES?"
4,Good value for the price,"I love this chair but as the other people who reviewed the item point out the table sticks. In fact it began two days after it was assembled. The assembly was tedious, but did not take longer tha 30 minutes. I have looked at several similar chairs and they are double the price of this one. I have had several compliments on the chair. It is worth the price."
5,Worth the money!,This chair is amazing! Very easy to put together. It looks great and is very comfortable. Love the sliding table.
4,Nice Lounge Chair,Nice chair a little on the sort side. I would recomend this chair it is a good deal.
3,Lounge chair wood,"Not a bad product for the price...looks good, however to try and use the allen keys provided to put it together is a joke.One part came broken and other parts are not drilled out enough...which I had to do in order not to strip the bolts and or screws. Get what you pay for...looks great."
4,Happy Customer,"I purchased two Strathwood Chaise Lounges and I'm very happy with my purchase. The assembly was pretty easy, about 20 minutes for each lounger. Seems to have great quality and my teenagers have really enjoyed sun bathing on them. They are very easy to maneuver around the backyard. I definitely recommend this product, especially at this price!"
2,beautiful but broken,"I just finished assembling this product and will probably figure out a way to repair the back adjustment bar that arrived with a split and broken dowel. The instructions were not always clear, but intuition kicked in and I got the job done. I recommend sorting out the various bolts ahead of time, so you can save yourself the aggravation of trying to match the bolts to the task at hand. The assembled product looks nice, but beware: besides the crushed dowel end on the backrest the wheels arrived with some cracks in place which will eventually cause product failure. I noticed that some folks have returned the chaise lounge to Amazon because of the same product problems. Logistics prevent me from returning the entire chaise lounge- I'd be very happy if I can get a replacement part."
5,lounge alot,a little on the small side but so well put together and a heavy piece. The built in table is nifty.Love them. i bought two.
2,Does Not Hold Up,"I have been thinking ""okay for the money"" until this Spring. I have had mine two years now and have put up with sloppy craftsmanship and poorly cured wood. I didn't mind too much having to retool the support on the sliding tray because it didn't slide. I didn't mind having to glue the various cracked pieces of wood. But now the thing is literally falling apart and I'm not sure it's worth repairing. So buy it if you only need it for a short while and don't mind tossing it."
3,It's just OK.,"I bought this chair a couple of years ago. It's very well made and nice to look at. The only problem for me at least, is that there isn't anywhere to put your arms. It's just not that comfortable."
2,poorly made,"I bought two of these. I have one finally put together. what I have noticed is:1. the assembly instruction is not very comprehensive.2. some of the wood boards are cracked and already falling apart.3. one of the Barrel Nut is too tight and does not fit.4. one of the wood boards was broken and out of place with a missing screw.All and all Starthwood is not making sturdy product, it's kind of waste of money.Kathy"
3,Stain Finish Drips and Runs When Wet,"The lounge is built nicely and is sturdy, but if it gets wet, the stain finish runs and drips all over the patio. Our patio gets a stain outline of the lounge if it rains and the stain has to be scrubbed off. The stain on our other Strathwood outdoor furniture does not drip or run when wet. Can't figure it out."
3,Okay for the price,"My husband and I ordered two lounges. One arrived with a broken sliding tray. Rather than go through the hassle of boxing it up and sending it back, my husband re-stapled the displaced slats and glued the split piece of wood holding them in place. The packaging for shipment had no padding and was inadequate. The wood was not of high quality, nor was the finish work. The level of saturation in the stain varied by pieces, some of which were rough. We put two coats of spray varnish on the wood with hope that it will last. Given the price, we decided to keep the lounges, though did not feel we received the bargain that we thought."
3,OK for the price,"I am in the process of assembling the chaise. We need the proper size bolts for the wheel assembly, the wrong size was sent. One wheel has cracks & one long support board has a crack but we are going to work with that. We are going to request request a replacement wheel since the cracks are on the side facing out. The box was pretty beat up upon arrival. The $99 price & free shipping sold me on this product & I think it will be OK if the manufacturer is responsive to our requests for the replacement parts."
3,You get what you pay for!,"These are cheap for a reason. The good points are that they can be put together in about 15 minutes. They look nice on the patio. The bad point is I had to sand some of the wood. I got a splinter putting it together. The wood isn't a heavy guage wood. Don't let the kids jump on it, you will crack it.All being equal, for $98 its worth it. You get a average to below average lounge chair for a slightly below average price. If anything happens to it, OH WEll, I won't feel bad about tossing it.signedToo good to be true"
5,satisfaction guaranteed,"We were very pleased with every aspect of our order. We received the items, (umbrella, umbrella stand and chairs) within three days of placing our order. All the items were exactly what we expected, and more. We will not hesitate to order more Strathmore patio furniture, from Amazon, as it becomes needed.Thank you very much for the quality and for the service. It was very much appreciated."
4,LOUNGE CHAIR,"This is a nice chair for the price! Very functional, easy to move around, and shipped very quickly. The only thing missing on this chair are the arms. It would be very comfortable with arms."
4,Leg Holes Don't Match Up!,The holes in the axle support blocks didn't exactly match up with the holes in the chaise frame! It was a real struggle with the small alan wrench that is supplied. I had to file the holes in the axle support blocks to get it to go together. My hands had blisters when I was done. The remainder went together without a problem.
3,Quality Concern,"I purchased two Strathwood Chaise Lounges. They are exactly what we wanted, but we have a small quality problem. While one of them was perfect, the other had a cracked frame on the foot end that I had to glue together and fasten with a screw. One of the wooden wheels is now separating, as well, after less than a month."
4,Very pleased,"We are very pleased with the chairs. They are very sturdy and look great and we love the slide-out trays. We did apply a new coat of teak oil to them before we put them out on the deck. We have had several big storms with heavy rain and the stain has not run at all, as others had reported. I do wish the back had a position that allowed you to sit up straighter. They are a great value - hundreds of dollars cheaper than similar chairs I found."
3,WisSkye,"We ordered two of these. One arrived with a broken part that supports the back rest. Amazon quickly replaced the lounger after we shipped it back. Sadly, the new lounger had the same part broken. We had to return it also. We had a conversation with customer service and they said that they have notified the warehouse that there may be a quality problem with the product. Then they recommended that we wait a week or so until the stock on hand had been checked out. Supposedly, we should be protected from defects after this inspection. We will soon find out, as we just ordered a replacement. Amazon has been good about this problem, only disappointment is that we have spent most of the summer with only one lounger and two cushions!! The one we have that is in working order is wonderful. It is solid, the little table that slides out is handy, and the backrest is sturdy. Not a bad buy."
4,great buy for the price,"I read all of the reviews here and decided to buy two of these. One did arrived damaged but Amazon was very helpful with that. They sent me a new chair right away. It was a bit of a pain in the neck re-wrapping it though and due to the damage they were not here in time for my son's bday party as we hoped they would be. But the customer service was great.I did seal the chairs as some other reviews suggested. They look awesome! I figured it was worth the time and effort to save some $ and not have them stain our patio. I have noticed though a tiny bit of stain from the chairs on the patio, but am still pretty happy with them.I would buy them again."
4,great value and appearance,Delived on time and appearance better than expected. Rather simple assembly. An area for improvement is the manner in which the wheels are secured. They have a tendency to loosen when moved.
2,Never stop bleeding,"I've had these chairs for a couple of years now and I can say that I truly dislike them and can't wait to replace them. I have a concrete pool deck and these chairs have never stopped bleeding and still stain the concrete. It's very unsightly, so I have to go through the trouble of moving them off of the concrete before it rains. My wife used an oil sealer on them to try to stop this and it did nothing. I am looking forward to replacing them but we need to try to get through another season or so.I'm giving this product 2 stars because I think they might be fine if they were located in an area where the staining wasn't a problem and also because they are inexpensive (you get what you pay for)."
2,Don't ever let it rain!,"The strathwood chaise lounge is probably a fine lounge, as long as it is not exposed to the elements. When it rains, the stain on the wood runs off and stains patios. The slide out table also warps everytime it rains and it takes several days before it will once again slide. I had reported this problem when I bought this lounge and was offered a replacement lounge which I took, hoping the first one was a fluke. Unfortunately, the same thing happened with the second one. The lounge was easy to assemble, seemed to be sturdy construction, and rolled easily on large wheels. So, if you have a covered area for the lounge, it is probably a fine product. Just don't put it outside"
2,chaise lounge,"I really liked the chair, very easy to assemble and wanted another until it rained. I too had a lot of staining. I used bleach and water and it came up, but I have had to do this every time and won't be ordering another. I wrote the company and they said to saok it with a hose in the grass. I would probably have to do this for a year to get all of the stain off of it!!!!"
1,Do Not Purchase This Item,"Unfortunately I bought four of these chairs before I saw the other reviews about the dye leaking. Being cautious, I applied two coats of teak oil and then sprayed the chairs with water before using them. This past weekend was the first weekend that it rained and ALL 4 CHAIRS leaked dye onto my white patio. I don't expect the best chairs for this price but I also don't expect an outdoor piece of furniture to leak dye when wet. Do not buy this defective product."
5,Lounging on the deck!,I have two other shorter ones without wheels that I bought a few years back from plow and hearth that was more expensive. This one seems just as good if not better. Highly recommended.
3,nice chaise for the money!,"I found this chaise lounge chair to be as good in quality as others I have seen for hundered of dollars more. The assembly of the chair was a little hard because the pilot holes for the screws were too small and made it hard to tighten. My hands were sore after doing my two chairs. Also, as soon as it rained, the stain color bled onto my brick patio. I will have to spray a protector on the chairs in order to stop the stain from continually bleeding. My cushions have been on back order for weeks. I wish they had shipped with the chairs in a more timely manner."
1,BEAUTIFUL/COMFORTABLE BUT STAINS CONCRETE,"I bought 4 of these chaise lounge chairs - they look beautiful and are easy to assemble. What is NOT appealing is the stain it leaves on the concrete when it rains. The stain used for these chairs run and create puddles under the legs, which I have not been able to remove using my power washer. Great chair if you don't leave it in the rain; great chair if you have it on gravel or rocks but not concrete or cobble stone. Just something to think about. Next time I will purchase plastic or chiase loungers without stain in the material."
3,good for price but some problems,"I found this fairly easy to put together, but the size is rather small, and I missed arm rests. The sliding table is convenient. Unfortunately one of the wooden wheels broke soon, and glue wasn't strong enough to hold against rolling the lounge around."
2,Stain runs,"We liked the chaises, and felt they were very well priced. But now after 5 days of rain here in PA, our cement pool decking is stained from the bleeding chairs."
4,Not bad for the price,"This is not bad for the price, compared to others in its category. Not as nice as teak, but for $99 it is a good deal. Warning, it is a bit shorter than most average loungers. My cushions from Pottery Barn were way too long for it. When you get it, apply teak oil to it right away. It gets dry quickly."
4,Chaise Lounge,Seems to be a good value. Wood looked like it was sturdy but finish was questionable. I gave it a good coat of teak oil as other reviews said stain used at factory was water soluable and damaged patio when iot rained
5,Great deal,Bought two of these chaise lounge chairs. Just like the picture. First chair we used the supplied tools to assemble and it took alot longer. Second chair we used our own tools and it assembled so much easier. Don't know about wear and tear of the chairs yet but also bought the teak oil and will keep that on them. Put the first application on before they went outside.
1,Broken and Uncomfortable,"The title says it all, this chair is not worth the wood that it is made out of. Arrived broken, and even after it was fixed it feels cheap and is uncomfortable."
3,"Good pump, but much larger than I expected","Just received this. I think the Mini in the name led me to believe this would be like some of the Nike pumps that you find in sporting good stores, that really are pocket-sized. This one is not. It's a good pump (just used it to put some more air in my balance ball), and it IS portable, but it measures about 11"" long and 2"" wide. It's hard to tell that from the picture."
3,Simple hand pump,"Does the job, simple hand pump for things like swiss balls or pool rafts. It worked fine to inflate my exercise ball"
4,Does the job,"The pump does the job! For a small 9"" inch exercise ball it takes almost no effort at all, for a larger ball it is a bit more work but not too bad. The pump held up well through several pump up sessions.The hardest part of pumping up the exercise ball is removing the air stopper from the ball. If someone has a trick on how they do it, I would love to hear it!"
1,It's not mini,it is much bigger than I thought and almost the same size the one I have for my bicycle.No reason to buy just for this ball.
1,"One person's junk, another person's treasure!","I bought this to be able to take on our long trip that is upcoming. I tried to just blow up a mini ball & it wouldn't do it. Air leaked around the needle. My husband even tried to use a different needle, mine is junk, but from the other reviews, maybe I just got a bad one. Contacted Theragear, haven't heard from them yet, but will change my review if they seem to care. Sorry about the negativity, but it's the truth!"
4,Grand turismo 3.,"This is just like any other grand turismo games, it is hard and it takes forever to beat the game. This is the first one on ps2 so the graphics r allot better than other ps2 games. It has many songs on it but i only like one of them. It does not have as many cars as the newer ones but it has tons compared to other racing games. The background is really good too. There r many cars to choose from and the multiplayer is really fun. That is about it for this game but it has a great multiplayer and really good graphics."
5,Great game!!,"The first thing I noticed when I started playing this game was--the graphics. They look very, very, very...realistic. I've played atleast a couple hundred hours on this. It's extremely hard, but you would love it even if you don't have much interest in racing. I didn't, but now I'm looking for more racing games because of the pleasure this game gave me!! But don't play this game if you mind playing solid chunks of a couple hours...I mean, endurance races can take a couple hours or more!! Have fun!"
5,Greatest Game,Simply the most addictive video game in history....for car enthusiasts of course! Highly recommended!
4,Good,"This game is loud, exhilirating ,and it pushes ps2 to its limits, but one thing the makers forgot was the fun factor. I got this game early (July 10), and I was so excited. I got to play it two days before everyone else in america! I went out and paid 100$ for the GT Force racing wheel and I even got the strategy guide. The second I got home I hooked everything up and was planning to sit for hours, but it was soon shortened to a few minutes. The game sometime feels too ""real"". If you hit a wall, or barley even brush it, you lose control for a few seconds and go careening sideways across the track. Turning is also pretty difficult. If you barely go off of the tar, your car slows way down and you do a spinout and lose control. If it were tweaked the game would be perfect, but it wasn't. I deserves no more than the rating I gave it. A four."
2,Far from perfect...,"Ok, let's get some things straight. GT3, obviously, is the most talked about game so far on the PS2 platform. .... The only reason the game is selling is because of its previous success with its two predecesors. Graphics get a 10 out of 10. The sound is great too. Other than that, there are way too few tracks and cars, gameplay modes, especially multiplayer, are severely limited, and a ten year old would do better driving a real car than the controls on this game, which are nearly impossible to master. Now don't get me wrong, I own many racing games and am not saying the above just because I dont like the genre. True, it is a great game. However, Sony had the capabilities of making it an outstanding game. In other words, save your money for Metal Gear Solid 2."
3,"Becoming wooden, and a bit boring","Yo! I've been gaming since I was in my teens. And I didn't get a Playstation until 2000, when the PS2 was super hard to get.So, I didn't get GT 1 or 2 until around 2001. I loved those games. They really rocked. I actually remember GT 1 being the funnest.Well, we have another version of this game, in GT 3. I have to say, this game is getting a bit wooden and boring. A Sim, it is, but without some ""crashes"" or other effects, it just falls flat, as far as I'm concerned.I would not recommend buying this, unless it is the first GT you've played. Than, you may as well get GT 4, right?I would say buy it as a first GT owned; other than that, nothing new here. Move on.MC White said: It's a'iight, but nothing new here."
2,Below Average,"Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay. Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about? When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation. The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring. This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want. If you want a fast paced, fun, exciting, and non-repetitive game, then get Burnout 2 or Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. These two games have a lot more different game modes that will keep you busy for hours while your Gran Turismo 3 sits on the shelf."
2,"Dont get it, save your money!","This game is very old and crappy. When you're driving in a car and want to turn the car spins out and you fall back to last place. You can tell that the people who made it cut corners and didnt take their time. If you collect racing games or something like that, get it. But, if youre just a casual gamer, dont waste your money."
3,An ok game,"this game isnt nearly the best racing game Ive seen. The cars look good but their handling isnt real at all. There is no car damage and you cant spin out other cars. Your basically just racing the track. The cars dont handle anything like the real things either. I own a Miata and an Aston martin and they dont come close in this game. The Rally portions of this game are easily the most rwarding but No Damage just puts this game further down my list. If you enjoy suping up Civics this is your game but if your into hot rods and real racing try something like Nascar Heat, Formula 1, or World of Outlaws Sprint cars. You'll see what real car setups feel like."
5,Gran Turismo 3 a-spec,"This game is great for if you palyed the pervious Gran Turismo games.It is much more better then the other two.You will like it once you played it.A few months ago, I had a friend who really like Xbox.He played it and he liked it.I would give it to anywon."
4,"Racing Simulator - NASCAR, look out!","With the fun driving games out there, it was refreshing to find such a challenging games as GT3. Although it'd been out there for a few years, I just picked it up and am glad I did. I like the ""fun"" arcade style driving games, but I get bored with them after a while. GT3's realism keeps me playing the same track over and over and over, trying to beat my previous performance. I spend a lot of time in front of this game, bending the sticks on my PS2 controller, much to my wife's chagrin.If you like fun driving games, but are looking for something with more of a ""self-challenge"" feel to it, try GT3."
2,DON'T BUY THIS GAME,"This game is dull and not very entertaining. The cars are very hard to control and even though the graphics look very real, that is about the only good thing about this game. This game is just a waste of money."
2,Overrated...,I don't really understand why this game got so much hype really. It's nothing special. There really isn't anything great about this game.
2,"THIS IS'NT A GAME, IT'S A DMV DRIVER'S TEST","If you like advertisements at every turn, on every vehicle, in allmost every song played and know how to for real really race a car down a buteiful looping course with cutt out cardboard fans. Then for all means purchase this game, I'll use it for charcol to barbaque some nicely portion pieces of slaughtered cow."
2,not as good as what people said,It gets boring after 1 or 2 days. The graphics are great but i dont like the way the car looks on the screen during game play. Dont waist money cause of what other people say rent the game first.
5,The best racing game available on a console today,"Gran Turismo...where to start. Well, the game has great (probably the best) racing graphics, and it's got all the great cars, but what really matters is the quality of game play. If you like racing, this is the best one out there. And if you like tweaking your cars, you can fine-tune until you get it *just right*...you'll never know of course.Beginners, don't worry, it's fun and easy out of the box. Just don't go driving afterwards."
3,"Looks good, but it's hard as hell.","I purchased this game with great anticipation. I played the original GT and I own GT2, but I lost interest due to the degree of difficulty involved in playing the game.This game looks, feels, and sounds amazing, but once that excitement has passed, you're just left with an incredibly difficult game that is often more frustrating than fun. I can see why people love this game, but I just don't have the time to commit to building up a custom car, or learning how to drive all the different styles of cars in order to get anywhere in the game.A great game, just make sure you have about 5 months to spare."
5,The best racing game for PS2,"This is a must- have game.If u don't have it already u need 2 get it. It is hard but incredibly fun. The graphics are incredible, the cars are so detailed. YOU MUST GET THIS GAME!!!"
4,This game has the WORKS!!,Most of the good thing about this game is the graphics and the type of cars you can get the thing about this game is that you can't get any ferrari's of lamborghini's.But then again Graphics are the best.
4,Excellent Racing Game,"This game lived up to my expectations of the reviews. It is an awesome game to play if you like to race cars. It offers so many cars like Ford (Escape, Contour, etc.), BMW (1 3 Series, thats all), Benz (3 cars), Aston Martin, Jaguar, Acura (MDX, CL, no TL or RL though), Audi, VW (bug only), Honda (Civics, Accord, etc.), Toyota, Mitsubishi, Dodge (Viper), Chrysler, Subaru, Shelby (Cobra only), and a whole lot more. I would recommend this game to check out and rent to see if you like it too. The game is so realistic its amazing! You'll spend hours playing it having fun."
5,i expected less but got more,my friend recently got his hands on a demo of gran turismo 3 you get to pick from a few cars and 1 race track as far as i can tell nothing will beat this game except MGS2 sons of liberty. pure perfection
4,not for the casual player....,"WOW ...... I dont want to sound like a whiner but being a huge gran turismo fan from the first game i feel i have grounds to voice. Gran Turismo A-SPEC too hard to be fun, the new fancy cars that a person needs to be competative are way to expensive, i've invested many many hour into this game and im still at the begining and not experiencing the thrill of driving...Ill admit the grafix are great and im sure if i had three weeks straight to put into this game I could get somewhere, but i just lost intrest. I cound play gran turismo 2 for days on end cause i could compete, but not this, a game for die hards only...."
5,Awesome,This game is so very cool.If you can't afford the real deal this is the next best thing to driving these beauties.
3,Good graphics...but its mostly rehash...,"I can really be honest when i say that GT3 was my least favorite of the series. The graphics are great, but that is about as far as it goes. My biggest complaint about GT3 in a nutshell is that there was absolutely no innovation present. There are less cars, only 2 new tracks, and the liscenses are extremely difficult to obtain. If you think about it, Gran Turismo 1 was completely new to the scene and blew everyone away...GT2 was even better because it had so many cars to win and you felt rewarded for putting in effort...but with GT3 you know the drill. I'm not saying that GT3 was a terrible game, but it could have been a lot better. I would definately rent it first. You will probably have all you can stand in 3 or 4 days."
4,"hey, it's pretty good","When I first got this game, it was kind of boring in the arcade mode, but when I discovered the simulation mode, it started to be pretty fun. the only bad parts is that when you dont have a very good car, than you have to do the same race over and over again to get some money. Other than that, it is a very good game and I recommend it to anybody."
1,overrated game,this game is boring and overrated. the controls are too difficult to manuver and after playing for 2 months i still could not handle the car properly. don't waste your money on this. wait till gt4 comes out later this year and hopefully the controls will handle better.
1,gran turismo 3 the true preview,its fast its furios and its total BORING yes lads its time to play one off the ORIGINAL GAMES OF THE PLASTATION 2 they promisedrevolutionar new innovation and gameplay and we got Gran turismo3 its just like its proceeder just with better graphics and someusual awfull tech dance beats and the ofcourse bad control(like playing ice hockey just with cars)REMEMBER you are gonna stay on that road not drive beside it.you can get about 200 carsif you manage to stay awake because you have to get a car withat least a little control performance (TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO DRIVE THE SAME STUPID TRACKS OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT A 1000 TIMES TO GET A DECENT CAR.)if you do that you sure dont have anyfriends playing games with you anymore (THEY ARE BORED TO DEATH)I WOULD RATHER LIKE TO PLAY MARIO KART THATS FUN!!!!!!!!!!!)
3,Not bad,Cars Drives not good they spin so much and its so hard to hold the car on the road... Its not like NFS i tried that too..
1,LISTEN!,I Love Arcade games. That may be the reasons why I can't friking turn. Can't turn buy a good car. I got a dodge viper. It goes really fast but A Viper in the Evo challenge I think not. Could be good if I could turn.
4,Really Good,"GT3 is a really good game, period. The graphics are very good except for a few race tracks where buildings appear out of nowhere and very fuzzy grandstands. This license exams are very challenging and take great skill to even pass the tests, so dont even think about getting all golds right away (took me forever to get all golds on all licenses). There are some unrealistic factors though. If your car is the same car as a computer racer, there car is way more faster, so on races where only one car is allowed, modifications are needed on cars. It is definately a good game and has excellent replay value. If you dont have this game yet, get this before you get Resident Evil Code: Veronica X or any other hot new game out there."
3,"More of a real simulator, less of an arcade game","I know this series is all about being the total driving simulator, but I just didn't find it that much fun. The AI doesn't seem all that wonderful, and it's just too much realism. If you're looking for an arcade style game to play with friends, I would reccomend that you buy a different title. Way too complicated for me!"
5,Great for gamers,"I personally enjoy driving games where I can customize my autos. Although a huge fan of the Need For Speed series, this game is spectaular!"
5,GT3,"This is a fantastic game. I had played the previous versions a few times, but only in Arcade mode. I never really got into completing the different levels in the Simulation mode. It's hard at first, but after you get into it, it is so much fun. I highly recommend this game. That graphics are fantastic, and it's a lot of fun to play."
4,not bad,"This was a pretty good game. The graphics are almost real and the sound track is good. There are tons of cars (some of them are too expensive)You will go through each league doing different races with different cars. You will win money for winning a race, and the courses are interesting. Now for some of the bad things. The game can get boring after a while. Races can be way to hard. Licences get annoying. Somtimes you need to do the race over and over to get money for a good car. The beggining is easy (i'm at the end of the beginner league). Also you might need to soup up your car a lot to compeat with the others.You should buy this game if you want a hard game to play."
5,great game,"I think that this game is a very good game. It takes lots of time to complete. At first when I got the game I was very upset because there are no used cars. The only option I had was to get one of about eight slow cars that you can afford at first. In the second Gran Turismo, you have better and faster cars to choose from when they're used. This game also needs a steering wheel for better gaming experience. Overall, I like the graphics, but I wish there were more cars to choose from. If only they made expansion packs to add more races and cars..."
3,"Very realistic, but wach out, it has it's cons","GT3 is overall very good. If you are into live auto racing, you will love this game. But this game is very picky. One little mistake and you could loose the race. You can't be flying around corners like in high speed police chace games, you need to be very precice. You need an expert on how to break, acellerate, and turn, or the whole turn will go wrong. So getting licences is basicly driving school. So if you want to get a fast action paced game like the Need for Speed games, get that, not this game."
4,cool cool...............,This is a preety good game basedon graphics and gameplay but the downside is there is only about 130 cars or so to some people this might seem like alot but to hardcore racing fans i say wait till granturismo 4 comes out there is supposed tobe around 500 cars 100 tracks and picture enhanced backgrounds which means extremely good graphics.so if your a casual racecar game player this is a good choicehint if you do buy this game and if u have enough money buy the pagani zonda and upgrade it all the way IT SUPER SUPER FAST YOULL LOVE IT!
4,"A little late, but I still want to review it!","THE STANDARD of racing game so far. The classic that offers you real mode racing, and drifting. Most everything about this game is cool. I just bought it, even though I have played it long time ago. I just never owned my own copy until now.... paid $8 for it. ... sweet. Buy it, because this is one for keeps."
5,GT3 review,"What can I say, its awsome. If you've got the game, then you know what I mean, and if you havn't got it, GET IT NOW!! The graphics are top notch and the cars handle so realistically. The only downsides are the predictable A1, and the fact that you can only win the car from every group of races once in the whole game, (unless you use 2 memory cards). Despite these 2 problems, the game is exceptional and it is a must own game for any PS2 owner."
4,Best PS2 game yet!,"I would really give this game a 4.5 star rating. This game has awesome graphics, great physics, excellent and controls. If you like racing games this is a must. However, there are a few things to keep in mind. First is that there is no damage simulation. So you can keep slamming into things and the car looks great (but there is a car wash to wash the car for aerodynamics....for $50! That doesn't make much sense). Also, there are not a lot of useful cars to pick. Don't get me wrong, there is a great variety, but not what I was looking for, no Ferrari, 911 Turbo, Diablo, etc........The reply view is awesome to watch, especially because it makes you feel like you drove the tack like a pro. The tracks are great also, the only thing is that you can't flip the car....believe me, I tried. Still, I love this game, and I am glad I bought it. It is the best game I've played for PS2. I don't have the steering wheel, but I'm ordering one today."
2,just plain bad,"I really wasn't impressed with the graphics in this game, unless I missed something by only playing the 2-player versus mode then these graphics are rather poor. I also can't recall any of the soundtrack so I guess it wasn't too memorable. The control of the cars didn't seem all that impressive either."
5,Will the real idiots please complain?,"My dad bought this game and my friend,him, and I started playing it the first day. The graphics were awesome, they had great cars, what more could you ask for from a car racing game? If you are looking for the best game to buy on the PS2, then buy this game. All of this stuff kicks butt. [....] This is by far the best [...] game on the market,so what are you reading this for? Go buy it!!!"
2,Good graphics but sluggish controls,"I recently renterd this game after hearing how great it is. My father and I were playing it and had a hard time controling the cars, we both felt that we couldn't control our cars and all we did was weave and run into rocks and everything else. The graphics on the other hand were wonderful and as great as I had heard."
5,GT Strikes Again...,"how to top GT2?? it was a great game with endless cars and familar tracks... GT3 added a little more to the graphics and physics of the game... but it did not have the same level of rides... the new look is great, it just preps the PS2 for GT4..."
2,Tedius and Frustrating,"Racing games are about...racing. Don't expect much action with Gran Turismo 3 as you will be spending all your time trying to qualify or unlock tracks to race. The game is not fun because of all the requirements and things you have to do with menus and licenses before you can even race some of the levels. The game's one BIG plus are the graphics. You will be amazed at how smooth and well presented everything is.GT3 has all the same tracks as the previous GTs. The interface is very confusing. I got lost in all the menus. The game was not clearly thought out as far as game play enjoyment. This is the only racing game that prevents you from racing. Try Need for Speed, R4 or one of the Wipeout games if you want to have racing fun. I would skip GT3. If you are serious about purchasing it, rent or borrow it first. You may save yourself $$ by doing so."
1,I REALLY HATE THIS GAME,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME, IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH IT! I HAVE IT RIGHT NOW, I WISH I COULD GET IT OFF MY HANDS!"
1,Review for what?,"I am unable to give a review for the game, for the reason, that I still have not received my products.Sincerely, Toolsie"
3,Great driving Game,"GT3, the follow up to GT2, is a great simulation racing/driving video game. A myriad of cars are available for you to try out and to drive during your time behind the wheel. If there is a knock on this game, they limited the number of used cars available in GT2, I loved to deck out old 85 RX-7's and other priceless cars from the mid-80s. Still this game has the cars, the tracks, and the excitement needed to keep you driving for hours and hours."
3,GETS BORING FAST,"First of all, I am not a fan of racing games, but when I first played it over my friend's house, I was amazed. THe graphics are sensational. The best I have ever seen for ps2 so far. NOw when I first had the opportunity to rent it, my thoughts changed.I reallized that this game is super challenging, but its NO FUN AT ALL. It takes you almost forever to get the car you want because you have to spend your money on parts for the car you have in order to win races for larger amounts of money. IF YOU WANT TO BUY THIS GAME, you'd better have a lot of time on your hands. Another flaw, the game has a ton of cars, but where the hell are the levels at? I think there is about five or six levels to race on. You could probably unlock a few, but im not sure.Another bad thing. Only 2 cars can race in 2 player battle. SO I give it a three star rating because of the graphics and car selection."
5,Great,This game is stunning. The slick glow of the sun on the car. The handling. And all the choices of cars. This works best with a steering wheel though.
4,"Beautifull Game, the BEST racing sim of all ...But","Firstly,I must say the Car Modeling and the improved interface in this game are very much welcome in this series evolution.Having owned both GT1 and 2 I expected more(Yes i said it!)For example there was no reason to remove the used cars section or the Racing upgrades for certain cars.Even to use your cars and settings from GT2 would have been nice.In many ways i believe most (magazine reviewers) are so easily swayed by the AWESOME graphics.But if polyphony digital would have added to some of the nice additions in GT2 we Could be REALLY be talking a true ""10"". This won't become apparent to most until they've completed the game.All my nitpics aside this ""is"" the best racing sim on ANY console and i don't see anyone knocking it from the throne of greatness anytime soon."
5,One word...AMAZING!,"I'll make this short and simple; if you're looking for the most realistic racing sim with the best graphics that'll keep you interested and busy for months...look no further. Oh, and for all you F1 fans, well, you'll see ;-)"
4,Rent. It Makes Less Of a Dent!,"Gran Tursimo 3 surely does take racing game graphics to a new level, but the gameplay is pretty much the same as the previous Gran Tursimo franchise. The cars are great, (amid the fact that they are fewer in number than GT1 and GT2). Spectacular effects such as water, dust and smoke are stunning. If you loved(and im stressing on loved), GT1 and GT2, then get this. If not don't!!!"
4,"good, but flawed","Fun game, but it's not realistic in the sense that the cars don't show damage. Maybe we'll see that in GT4.If you like racing games, you'll like this game. If you don't really like racing games, you might not like it very much."
4,Well worth the money,"My wife and I decided to buy a PS2 this Christmas because we reckoned the whole family could use it. The wife watches DVD's, the kids play powerpuff girls and bob the builder and me, well I play GT3!I'm not new to racing games. I was a fan of the original Indycar racing for the PC from papyrus, so I like games with realism and a lot of tweaking. GT3 is just the ticket. If you have your own family, like me, then you'll probably have to wait till they go to bed a GT3 needs 100% of your attention. The fun for me is not really just the racing but buying and upgrading the cars.If polyphony had included damage simulation, then I would have definately given 5 stars, as I feel this is lacking, nevertheless though, a video game should be judged on value for money IMHO and in that case, GT3 is the best value for money I've come across since NFS5 Porche. Excellent."
5,Someone help me stop!,"How incredible is this game? It's the best. It's so hard to schedule time to play my other games. I can't stop playing this one! There are so many cars to choose from. Maybe not quite as many as GT2, but when you see how perfect and real they look you'll understand why. And there are so many cups too choose from. The graphics are realistic! The cars are realistic! The physics are realistic! I even won a Formula racing car kind of early in the game. It's an awesome car, but when it made the game too easy to beat, I refused to use it anymore! I love the challenge to much!!! It's a sickness!! Help me stop!!"
5,HANDS DOWN the best racing game on the planet,"I bought my PS2 about 8 months ago, I own one game..this is it, I don't even care about other games anymore. I rented all the other racing games to try them out but I always go back to this one. I'm a car fanatic and this game caters to people like me. With nearly infinte adjustments you can make on the cars and the most awesome tracks on the planet, this game should get 10 stars. If you are after a REAL racing game, with no silly story lines and you want to drive REAL cars, buy this game! I started out with a 12,000 dollar Toyota Vitz with 100 horsepower, now I've got nearly all of the 180+ cars on the game including the Formula One models that have up to 1000 horsepower. Be prepared to spend A LOT of time on this game, it's not one that you will beat in a week, it's had me captivated for nearly a year now!! Just go buy it..NOW!"
5,One word: Awesome,"I just got my PS2 and GT3 last night...and let me say...wow! I loved GT1 when it came out, I loved GT2 when that came out. Each game makes significant improvements over the last......and then came last night....wow. GT3 is the best game that I've ever played in the comfort of my own home. If you do not own this game, and have any interest in graphics, great game play, cars, or racing, buy it, you'll like it."
5,BEST RACING GAME YET,This was the game that started it all. This has the greatest graphics of any racing game ever. Everyone should own or rent it
5,Best Racing game ever,"This is one awesome game. the graphics are so great! You really have to calculate every turn before you make them! Every good car is a lot of munny so you really have to work for them ( Except the dodge viper 83,000) This is one awesome game. The only thing that could make it better would be if there was a person in it like in Project Gotham Racing for Xbox. Every part of the game is great. This was one of the first games I got for the PS2. The other 2 were Crash Bandicoot Wrath of Cortex (why did naughty dog sell it) and Jak and Daxter (i see why naughty dog sold crash!) The only game i really was gran turismo 3 it was that good. Not saying that jak and daxter is not a great game. peace out"
4,"Nice graphics & realism, few too many hoops",This game has great graphics and very realistic movement. The cars react amazingly close to real cars. My only minor gripe is that is takes hours and hours of jumping through hoops (winning races & getting licenses) to get to better tracks and more interesting cars. Wish you didn't need a Game Shark to put in bypass codes.
4,Witch is Better,"Well,I bought the playstation 2 for one reason only,Ive waited what seems like forever to play the the game Gran Turismo 3 on the New PlayStation 2 and I have had 2 Disapointments!!Not only did The new PlayStation not get the game Soul Blade(Soul Caliber)perhapes in my opionion the greATEST FIGHTING GAME EVER but now I find it hard to tell witch is better Gran Turismo 2 or 3?Ya the graphics are a bit spiffier but not all that much like every body is claiming!!?It looks almost the same compare them if you dont beleive me!!And whats worse is the cars look slower while driving?Like as if it had to slow the game down to handle the graphics??!!I still like the game,Im still playing it for 4 days now since it came out,but I just wanted to say I expected alot more from the Play Station 2 witch Ive waited so long to get,becuz of availability and Price!!!Im still crossing my fingers on Soul Caliber!!!And Gran Turismo 4 will hopefully be the game of next year!!!"
3,Great racing game,"if you are a racing game and car fan, but casual gamers may find this game a tad boring after a while. It's just wham bam thank you mam. You can unlock different fancy racing cars along the way but the races get repetitive after a while. This game should have more rally tracks and cars, coz rally rocks."
