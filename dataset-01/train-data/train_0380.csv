5,Hail The King,"Yes I was lucky enough to see them at a club (now defunct Coast To Coast in Baltimore, with Exciter opening), and I did meet Hank Sherman before the show. Aside from that, man along with Slayer's Reign In Blood, this album WAS the peak of 80's metal. Obviously raised on the masters, Judas Priest (when they were great-Sad Wings Of Destiny),early Scorpions and UFO, Fate actually surpassed them with this record. King Diamond's vocal range is unbelievable and musically they just smoke from one complex time/key change to the next. A lot is made of the satanic lyrics; if that bugs you (who cares!!!)just listen to the musical ability these Danes possess. A great record to scare your unsuspecting holy roller co-workers with."
5,Lucifer is proud,"Enough cant be said about this work of Satanic art. It kicks totally ass all the way through and King Diamond's vocals are at there best. It even has my favorite Fate song "" Come to the Sabbath"". Every track is excellent and the song "" The Oath"" has to be one of the most satanic songs I've heard. Even the cover art is HELLa bitchin'. You cant go wrong with this album. SATAN COMMANDS YOU TO BUY IT."
5,this album RULES !,one of the absolute best Metal albums of all-time. Hank Shermann & Michael Denner are the best guitar duo I've EVER seen live !
3,Surfs up!,"I use the Surf spray religiously even if im not planning a day at the beach. I can get the same consistency without having to! I usually spray it on after i towel dry my hair and it gives it a ""Been to the beach and in the ocean"" feel. Ive been looking for something like this for a while. While i have fine, frizzy, curly hair, it's great just alone, no blow drying.I like it!"
3,Danny Thomas Road to Lebanon,"Not much Lebanon, I enoyed thos TV show as i loved Danny Thomas . I t is black and White but the video production is not good. If you like Bing Crosby and or danny thomas . You will still enjoy this."
4,Monsters at the Wall,"Reaper, D&D, Warhammer, Mage Knight your mini's maker does not matter. This castle system can be had quite inexpensively if you shop around and with a little weathering it can fit in with some of the best pro made terrain pieces. Works best with the typical 25-30mm figures.'"
4,not cheaper than instore,I was just too lazy to go to lowes. These do not come in a box as described. It came in a bag. They are also more expensive on here. 1 pound is about 50 screws.
4,"These screws can turn back time, so carry a spare if you wish to return","I bought these screws with the innocent intentions of replacing the drywall in my bedroom closet. However, after securing the first screw, I was suddenly sucked into a swirling space-time vortex. I had gone back to my early teenage years, where I was the biggest dork in my high school. I quickly improved my image and turned myself into the most popular jock in town. Once I was satisfied that I had corrected the most depressing years of my life that had contributed to the bulk of my severe mid-life clinical depression, I wanted to get back to the present. Luckily I had another screw in my pocket so I was able to use that to get home - otherwise I would have been stuck in high school forever.In summation, it is a great product, but make sure you carry at least one spare, lest you get lost in time!"
2,wish i would have gotten all the information from the seller,"I read all the reviews on this book, and loved what they said. I know that my sister will find this book helpful so I ordered it for her to give it as a gift. However the book came today, and to my surprise, there is writing in this book!!! It is now hard to give it as a gift when it was given to someone else, and that's written inside the book. Had I been told this at the time that I ordered it, I would not have gotten it from this seller. I am not happy with the seller that I did not get all the information at the time of my purchase."
4,Worth the read!,"Want a glimpse of where you will ultimately be living when you die?Read this book. If you don't believe, you will when you die!Also see my review of ""The Message""Enjoyed this book.Angelfish"
3,For True Believers Only,"Recently I was given a copy of Raymond Moody's Life After Life. Out of curiosity, I started browsing thru it. I expected it to be full of bizarre, wacko, supernatural stuff. Surprisingly, the book presented a fairly reasonable, objective look into the topic of near death experiences. It actually peaked my curiosity enough to buy another book on the subject.Unfortunately, the other book was this one, The Eternal Journey. This one was indeed full of the bizarre, wacko, supernatural stuff I originally expected.I gave it 3 stars (rather than 1), because I suspect that ""true believers"" will enjoy it, and skeptics will at least get a few laughs out of it."
4,Living Organized (AKA: The Messies Superguide),"Being merely an updated version of the Messies Superguide, I was a bit disappointed when I started reading this, since I wasn't aware of that fact before I purchased it. The book is fine, but I already had a copy of the superguide, and so I felt a bit ornery about it.Nevertheless, the ideas in this book are sound, and have helped me to slowly start organizing my own house. Heavy on theory, and rather light on examples, ""Living Organized"" spends most of its time reassuring you that no, you're not a horrible person because you can't keep your house clean, and yes, there are solutions to your problems. It does take a rather traditional view towards housework (referring to the ""motherly"" jobs of keeping ""husband and children"" organized, etc), but if you're able to take it with a grain of salt, then you should be fine."
1,what a mess,i was fascinated at first then i kept skipping through looking for the tools...im going to go through my clutter to find the book with the actual tools for organizing... organizing from the inside out. living organized was nearly a waste of my time but luckily it was free. clean out a drawer instead.
1,Messy Book,"This book itself is in need of decluttering. It's a mess! If there are any real organizing steps, I never found them It seems to be written exclusively for housewives with lots of kids. I waded my way through an explanation of right brain left brain theory followed by a silly short story. I skipped chapters about the husband and kids I never had. I finally gave up in a chapter about my dream house. At least the price was right. I paid nothing and got nothing in return."
2,Thank God it was Free,"I initially thought this would be a good book with the right brain/ left brain concept of organization.I did not like the way the author continued to categorize ""messies"" and ""cleanies""- I'm not 9 years old. I fee like she went back & forth between writing for an adult and an elementary school kid. Her tone was somewhat condescending & I quit reading.Glad it was free."
2,Made me cringe... enables messy people,"I truly wanted to love this book. I did. However, there were very few de-cluttering/ organizing tips and loads of excuses as to why messy people are messy. Sorry, I don't care if you are right or left brained... just give me nice, simple tips about how to organize/ de-clutter. This book enables messy people. Epic fail."
1,Wasted money,"This book is essentially a regurgitation of numerous other tomes on decluttering, but provides few tools to realistically make it happen (for me anyway). Flylady [...] provides actual tools, rationale, and gentle encouragement free - plus has a mailing list with reminders and stories (also free). Idiotic to pay for this book and waste the time reading it when far better FREE material is readily available."
2,Only Worth The Price As A Free Download,"Unfortunately, this book was worth exactly what I paid for it - zero dollars and zero cents. I actually plowed through the entire thing on my Kindle, which took tremendous discipline (and stubbornness).The author gets bogged down for a few chapters on the right brain/left brain psychology of who is a ""messy"" and who isn't. Then she punishes us with an extremely long, completely unrealistic story about a kid whose room gets so messy that he literally cannot escape his room. Neither credible nor relevant.I was expecting and hoping a more disciplined approach to the topic - with concrete suggestions and tips.I'm going to live organized by deleting this from my kindle.If this is still free for the Kindle, have at it - you may disagree with me, but if you have to pay for it, consider what my review and others have said first."
2,Speaking about clutter....,"This book spent a great deal of time talking about why she thinks people are messy (about 6-9 chapters, depending on whether you consider some of the chapters in part 3 useful - not really tips, a sort of pep talk). I say ""she thinks"" because I cannot find the psychology/scientific references for behaviors in the book. The editor should have make her keep to 1-2 chapters, and make most of the book about how to fix it. If a messy person picked up the book, which I suppose was her target audience, they may have put it down, because it takes too long to get to the help sections and to find the tips for organizing. However, it was free on Kindle, so what can I expect?"
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping to find a book filled with tips and tricks for keeping a tidy and organised home. Instead, I found a lot of information about why certain people are messy and why certain people are tidy - nice to know, but it did not really translate that into tangible tips to transform your house. Like other reviewers, I felt this book was a salespitch for her other book ""Messies Anonymous"" - whenever she referred to it, I thought ""why didn't I just buy the other book??""... but that quickly translated into ""why did the author bother to write this book if her other one is so good?!"""
2,"Not what I expected from a ""Hidden"" book","We had a fabulous time on the French Polynesian islands with ""Hidden Tahiti"". That book took us to out-of-the-way natural beauties, great local-style restaurants and shops, etc. So, when we were set to travel to Belize, we expected more of the same.Hidden Belize was NOT the same. We found nothing hidden in the book that wasn't over-publicized by local tour agencies, hotels, etc. The great little local-cuisine restaurants of the Tahiti book instead was replaced with all the expensive restaurants catering to wealthy US citizens wanting gourmet dinners. We found great local establishments featuring great local cuisine and culture all on our own. We actually used the recommendations of this book as places to stay away from.The one redeeming feature of this book was a good overview of the geography of the different areas of the country.So, as I said, my wife and I like to experience a lot of local flavor on our trips, and this book showed us none of that."
5,Smart thinking!,"Eminently readable and extremely helpful. Miles never talks down to readers, and the book is full of good sense about discipline. There's great advice throughout, and all of it is easy to put into practice right away. If you don't like being freaked out by or pandered to in parenting books, this is the one for you."
1,did not work,"I bought this to upgrade my toshiba notebook. There was no documentation, and it is not plug and play. The package says a one year warranty and free tech support, but there is no address or phone or web site listed. Wasted my money, maybe it was just defective, hope you don't make a mistake too."
4,Great work bag!,"This bag is great for everyday! It is the perfect size for carrying to work and has plenty of room for my laptop, planner, umbrella, water and any other items I need to tote back and forth. The interior pockets are handy for keys and work id and the center pocket/divider keeps things organized. Plus, I love the print and color!!!"
2,Low quality,"First of all i was sent the incorrect size by the vendor, but other than that the quality of the cap is really low, i ended up buying a dakine one at a local surfshop and its a different story quality / materials wise.Not recommended."
3,Obituary has Done better...But hey...The cover is cool :),"This CD does not belong in the same room as Cause of Death or World Demise...it does not belong in the same City.THey tryed to make a catchy hardcore death metal albumn but they failed.It almost seems like they rushed this record just to finish their Contract and move on to other things.The riffs are choppy and Boring.The drums are not up to par.And even Tardys vox seem off.If you are buying an Obituary CD for the first time Get any one but this one.This is Obituarys swan song...they broke up after the tour for this CD,and maybe that was a good idea...."
1,When is Allen West going to die!,"I guess since Allen's other band SIX FEET UNDER made it, he decided to totally take over the music for this OBITUARY album. Allen West's music is kindergarden metal. His riffs are so simple and boring to listen to. Trevor Peres is the better guitar player and should have done more of the music on this album. I've only listened to this album once and I've cast it aside (far aside). There are two songs I can tolerate on this album, and I know they were written by Trevor. The difference between Allen's music (how dare I even call it music, shame on me), and Trevor's riffs is like day and night. Allen west has probably never even taken one guitar lesson. Don't waste your time, don't waste your money, and long live James Murphy. See ya."
3,good groove oriented death metal,"Definately one of the weaker Obituary albums (my least favorite). Not nearly as dark as their past recordings. Don't get me wrong, I dig the album and listen to it quite a bit. It just does not have the impact that any of their previous works had. Their Bullituary rap remix is completely horrible. The production is magnificant and the music has a kicken groove. It's just that, to me, Obituary wrote some of the darkest and angriest music ever, and I don't get a dark feeling when I play this disc. After World Demise, I thought they were gonna come out killing. Maybe Allen West put too much time into Six Feet Under (Warpath, I feel, is a far superior album to this). This may be a bit of a letdown of an album for veteran Obituary fans, but I would not call it junk."
1,boring,"Obituary seems to follow an every other type of format, that is to say everyo other one is really good. Slowly We Rot was not so great, but Cause of Death is superb. Etc. So Back From the Dead fits in well following World Demise. I found Back From the Dead to be boring and slow. Especially lame is the closing Bulletuary."
2,Obituary?,"This album is beat. Repetitive and boring. After, in my opinion, one of the greatest albums ""World Demise"" I expected the best. No ""Kill for Me"" or ""Final Thoughts"" or ""Chopped in Half"" on this one. BEAT SH*T"
4,Chef's compendium of professional recipes,I needed this book for school and was glad I could find it for a reasonable price on amazon
5,JEHU WILL ALWAYS BE KING,"Drive like Jehu disbanded after the YANK CRIME tour. John Reis of Rocket from the Crypt, Hot Snakes,...and Rick Froberg (Hot Snakes) were the twin guitars that played their way into infamy. I love Froberg's vocals in both bands. Hot Snakes are good but not as powerful as JEHU. They are lacking the drumming of Mark Trombino who has gone on to produce lots of great bands Tanner, Jimmy eat world,Blink 182,Finch, and GOB. If you like JEHU then you need to check out PITCHFORK ans the HOT SNAKES. Reis and Froberg's band Pitchfork before they formed Jehu and the HOT SNAKES the band after JEHU."
2,Lose the last reel. And the first. And some of the middle.,"If a minute of film time is a page of script then this is a HBO mini-series from hell. Set 30 years ago a lot of the inside info is dated. Plus the book takes for ever to get going and even then ""going"" is relative. The writing is torturous and doesn't flow off the page, you find yourself drifting and then going ""What has the last page been about?"". I think you have to be a real die-hard movie buff to endure all the way through this one."
1,Low budget commercial,"I admit I stopped watching this about 20 minutes in, after waiting and waiting for it to get better. (maybe it did get better) The production value on this thing is pretty darn weak. In addition, it is basically a commercial for Mann lures. The overall instructional quality is low -- pretty much you watch two 60+ year old southern gentlemen cast and retrieve lures (fishing on a bass boat) -- occasionally landing a small trout, drum, or ladyfish. Water depth is discussed at one point -- and the camera focuses on the Mann depth finder. 90% commercial, 5% dudes talking in mumbling voices, and 5% fishing instruction. Poor showing.There is another review for this product that appears to reference a book. The review lists 5 stars. This review is erroneous in nature and does not reference the correct product."
5,An impressive book.,"If anyone is interested in bicycle touring this book will give you all the details. From all the preparatory steps, through the actual tour, to the concluding issues and logistics of getting home again."
2,Not that great.,"I found this book disappointing, especially after reading the rave reviews of others. This book tells the story of Harold Wagoner's bike ride from Seattle to New York. While I admire him for the adventure, most of the book is just reporting mileage, temperature,and meals. It is more a log book/journal than a travel story. We see little insight or growth from the author as he makes the trip and when it is offered, it is all Archie Bunker and bumper sticker slogans. By the end of the book, I was ready for the trip to be over.I gather this book is published through the modern day version of a vanity press. There were some enjoyable moments and the author has writing talent. But jarring typo's, punctuation errors, and spell check errors like using ""they're"" for ""there"" reduce the enjoyment. He could have benefitted tremendously from the help of a good editor.I don't think this book was worth the price."
3,What a trip!!!,"Reading this book was like driving by a car wreck - you know you probably shouldn't keep looking, but somehow you just can't stop. First the good stuff: Harold can ride. Bigtime mileage. Everyday. He also appreciates nature and doesn't let things like wind & rain bother him too much. Now the downside: while the guy claims to work in a missile factory, he's no rocket scientist. Heavy drinking, fast food gluttony, lechery, and latent bigotry were all mildly amusing if somewhat annoying, but his ignorance of bike mechanics was just plain hysterical.I definitely admire the guy for his feat, and I admit the book was entertaining in a Jerry Springer kind of way, but if this guy can sell a book for $23.95, in the words of Al Pacino,""Somethin's really wrong here!"""
5,Inspirational,"This book has inspired me to do a cross-country bicycle tour. If a 46 year old, overweight man who obviously enjoys his beer can do it, I'm sure I can. Thanks to Harold I'll find out in June."
4,Men of steel,"Boy, you had to be made of steel to raise those wooden ladders. It's vintage firefighting all right. If you like that stuff there's nothing better. But if you want to see the modern firefighter in action, take a look at ""Ricky's Rib Shack, a Firefighter's Journey"" You'll be amazed by the reality!"
1,This does NOT work!,I figured I'd save money and purchase this battery instead of one of Canon's for my S45 camera. My battery never charged. Just blinks red and green. Manufacturere wasn't any help when I finally reached them. Not worth it at all.
5,A death metal classic,"This was a great album, the only thing that surprised me was that in addition to the slower brooding songs I also got some frenetic blasts that were on the edge of early grindcore. Anyway, this is a pretty respectible effort in terms of technicallity, and its also got that great early death metal vibe of midnight blackness and brooding slowly building power. A high point are John Tardy's vocals which are great, up there with Chuck Schuldiner's on Leprosy, Spiritual Healing, and Human. I don't think this album sounds dated either, I think newer death metal either doesn't measure up or sucks."
5,OBITUARY!,"Awsome CD,just AWSOME,old school Death Metal,the way it was meant to be,not that Death/Grind, KILLER VOCALS, KILLER DRUMS, KILLER RIFFS, also check all other Obituary albums, they all rule..."
1,tropical aquarium,This is something I could have done with a video camera myself. The fish are so small you cannot see them.
3,Best of Foreigner With Different Twist,This tribute to Foreigner one of the finest melodic rock bands on earth is truly enjoyable. Track choice is mostly from the earlier ones. Must be so. Because the artists participating this Foreigner classics rendition have usually a bit more heavier vibe than that of Foreigner. It would be much more enjoyable to ordinary music fans if the artists' music was known to general fans. Departure's Mike Walsh did great job on FEEL LIKE A FIRST TIME. It sounds as if Survivor did this classic. It should have highlighted more unknown gems like REV ON THE RED LINE or PRISONER OF LOVE. My truthful advice is get the original album of any of the artist then you will find yourself loving this compilation much more.
3,"3 1/2 Some good Stuff, but some bad filler","The one thing you might notice about ""Serpents of the Light"" is that Glen's vocal seems to be acutally audible, which makes for a change of pace. Its still pretty fast and furious, as always, but still seems to have some ""filler"" that just plain sucks. The tracks that really stand out are Bastard of Christ, Slave to the Cross, Creatures of Habit, and the title track. The rest, well just seems like noise, with sloppy playing. Its not a bad album, its just not anything that really stands out and grabs you. At least its better then ""In Torment in Hell""!"
4,Satanic .,This is not happy music. It will beat you into submission. Brutal and unrepentent. If you like Marilyn Manson this will scare you. This is not an image! This is evil!
5,THE APEX OF AMERICAN DEATH METAL,"as far as riff-oriented American death metal goes, this is the best album out there. Put Pantera on baribiturates and you have this album. It is different from something like old Dismember or even Morbid Angel, but is more brutally heavy than those albums."
3,wow is that another song? or a short break?,"serpents of the light is decent if you like death metal. glenn's voice is awesome and powerful. gutar riffs are strong, but every song with the exeption of 1 or maybee 2 are in the same key. the drumming, well, this is really good with one exeption, the drummer seems to get into the same beat in ever song! and most the time, the songs sound a lot alike. the song that really stands out for me is creatures of habit because even though it's still in the same key, it's got a different rythm so i usually skip to that song after the first 2 or 3 otherwise i get bored of it."
4,Bible-bashing at its peak,"Not only is this album extremely anti-god,it is a fine piece ofwork.There are plenty of great guitar solos and growling vocalswhich seem to fit the mood perfectly.In my opinion the best tracks on this album are Serpents of the Light and Slave to theCross.So sit back,grab an upside down cross,and let the funbegin."
3,So-So Album,"Next to ""Legion"", this is Deicide's worst album to date. A few good things are that the lyrics aren't just about God bashing and have actually expanded to new topics. Another is an almost flawless production. And the last is the total standout tracks ""Blame it on God"" and ""Creatures Of Habit"". But if you are looking for something in the vein of Deicide I wold buy either Devine Empire's ""Redemption"" or Suffication's ""Despise the Sun""."
1,Not a good band.,"Regardless of their tired boring subject matter, Deicide is just not a good death metal band."
4,chico!,"This cd is real slower than there early ones. Its real heavy sounding,good satanic lyrics.screaming low and high death vocals,and even good solos.Not as brutal as legion,but i would buy it if i was into death metal or heavy metal,hail SATAN!"
2,I don't see the friggin point,"Though I'm a devout listener to groups that push the 'edge' such as Celtic Frost, Mercyful Fate, Slayer, and Grave, even I couldn't get past the mindless God-bashing to be able to hear anything at all catchy in the music. The vocals are equally uninspired. It looks to me to be all about touching a nerve to get publicity, like an anti-Stryper. I threw it away and used the case to store a copy of BOOTDISK."
1,Ridiculous,"If you like this band, you dont know what death metal is. Forget Deicide, get Nile, Suffocation, Cryptopsy, Dismember, Hypocrisy, Entombed, Carcass or Exhumed."
2,Kept current but spirit waning,"Deicide use a digital chaosblast of distortion and more single-note lead picking to keep their music current with the developments occurring in black metal, but their spirit is clearly slowing in impetus as many of these songs fall into formula or trite jingles structured around such basic assumptions they clearly assault your intelligence. However, there are standouts and the classic Deicide sense of melodic songwriting is still present, even if worn by the years. Get this after their first three, and only then if at all."
2,"Mediocre death metal, bores as usual","Well, well, well. What do we have here. The same ole same ole satanic lyrics, written quite terribly and unpoetically by Glen Benton, only this time, the music is just as bad. Take a bunch of disconnected guitar riffs that do not fit together, poor musicianship and songwriting (technical or not, it's a poor piece of music), generic growls, and an overall uninspired sound, and this is the album you get in the end. This won't scare anybody. The only thing ""scary"" about this album is that people paid for it and enjoy this generic piece of trash.Try Krisiun's new album, or perhaps Immolation's."
5,"Intense, intense, intense!!!!!!","Other reviewers say that this book has nightmarish qualities unlike any other. So very true. I'm a reading addict. I was a business traveler for years and found every neat used book store in every major Midwestern city. I picked up ""The Red Right Hand"" on a whim and was positively blown away. I read everything from Elmore Leanard to George Eliot, and Mr. Roger's book was without question one of the most unusual, frighening, and FUN books I've ever read. GO FOR IT"
2,not a classic,"I know this is supposed to be an American classic, but I found it to be very contrived. The book is all plot--as if a clever, twisting and turning plot is all that is required of a ""classic."" The characterizations are weak, and the writing is uninspired. It's an OK read if your expectations do not rise above the genre; i.e., if you enjoy the quickly written detective paperbacks published in the mid 1940's.Dan CLos Angeles"
5,This is a God Sent tool!,"I love this item. I go through a good 6 cups of Garlic a week and this has saved so much time.It does take a bit to get use to because of the two ""presses"" that press down into the two separate chambers are ""hinged"" and they swing; So, they tend to get in the way by hitting the wall that divides the two chambers and this can slow you down. (you can see what I mean if you look at the first thumb nail picture)The handles are a bit awkward with that little opening at the end of the handles and I do get my pinky caught at times.The cleen up is a bit of a pain.The garlic gets sticky and fibers stick to the blades and in the slicing/mincing chambers.A toothbrush works pretty good to help clean the tool.However the`issues' I have are such a small price to pay to replace the cutting/chopping and mincing by hand.Not to mention the `loss' of the garlic scented hands afterwards."
2,Paint chips off....,"I picked up this garlic press because it had the slicer option. Within a few uses, the paint started to chip off. I don't fancy paint chips in my food, so it's useless now. Trying to get a refund. Oh well, it was a pain to clean anyway."
3,Not Isreali Krav Maga,"I've had the fortune of training in several quality arts over the past 27 years, earning belts in a few (which really doesn't mean anything in the streets). Coming from a hard street background, with alot of exposure to gangs, made me a bit critical. Isreali Krav Maga, which I observed in Isreal as a member of the NEPSAW anti-terrorist program, is good. Unfortunately, this video program DOESN'T depict true Isreali Krav Maga. High kicks are shown as defense against knife attacks, each exposing the inner thigh to the opponent blade. Various other instances of training turned me off, to which the chief instructor told me that these tapes represent only the basics. I firmly believe that you start with the right stuff to end with the right stuff. Higher teachings must build upon the basics rather than contradict them, especially where people's lives are at stake."
4,One of the better self-defense systems.,"I am former military and I have a martial arts background. True, Krav Maga is a basic self-defense system but if you want to learn to defend yourself without spending years at it, this is one of my favorite systems. No forms, no belts and no kung fu silliness that could get you killed on the street.The videos show the techniques in slow motion and at street speed and they also have a solo training exercise at the end of each technique.This won't turn you into Bruce Lee but it is worth the money."
4,"Krav Maga, martial art of the new millennium","I have been involved in martial arts for over a decade now and have studied three different styles. After viewing the Krav Maga videos I can honestly say that I would recommend them to my family, because I did! If you are just becoming interested in self-defense or want to cross-train, then these are the tapes. The Krav Maga set not only covers the basics, but has dedicated tapes to both knife and gun encounters. These are techniques I have found lacking in my previous martial arts experience, but are arguably the most important in modern society."
5,Does what it says,"Pros: Gets sticky stuff off with the quickness. I usually don't spray it on directly. I apply it to a towel and then just start wiping. I have removed decals, stickers, sticky residue, and tape with this. Everything comes out clean.Cons: Gets you high when you inhale it. Please keep away from any huffing addict"
2,Etches Clear Headlight / Fog light Lenses,This product completely etched my formerly clear fog light and turn signal white on my 2005 911 Carrera S. No warning on the can. Had to sand down the lens using sanding disks from the 3M Lens Renewal Kit to removed the damaged top layer of acrylic lens. Do not get on plastic! No warning on bottle or website. Does an OK job of removing tar from painted metal.
2,Dangerous!,"I used this to clean the surface of my vehicle to install a 3m clear bra. It cleans good, but do not get it on plastic! It permanently stained some black plastic on the grill. Didn't see anywhere on the can that it does this. It may be useful for other applications, but not this particular one."
1,Review,"I was very disappointed with this book. All the recipes had salt and regular sugar, even for first solids ( for 6 months old babies)."
1,Problem with the CDs.,"The music is not the problem here. All their Holy War CDs are buggy, the tracks are playing fine but you will often notice weird sounds during the songs."
1,Source files used to create CD corrupted or process is corrupted.,"I bought this CD based on Dragonland's latest release, ""Under the Grey Banner"", which I rate very highly. Being their second release, ""Holy War"" is not as polished as Under the GB, either musically, or in production. However, it has some interesting moments throughout the CD and has the unmistakeable Dragonland sound.Unfortunately, the CD purchased from and created by Amazon, doesn't play properly on any player I own. They issued a replacement, but sadly the result was the same and I had to return it. If you can get an uncorrupted release elswhere, then I would suggest it is a worthwhile buy, but it is not outstanding in any particular area, just solid power/fantasy metal."
1,NOT AN OFFICIAL RELEASE_WATCH OUT,"Please don't buy this CD. As the previous reviewer ""The CD either will have a hiss or have a static sound for a split second, or during a song it'll cut in and out, or skip back for what is probably just a millisecond, but it is noticeable. I really hate to say it, but do not purchase this CD until they have fixed the issue"" You will loose your money!!! It is not an official release."
1,Music is great!! CD has static and skipping problems..,"As the previous reviewer has stated the music is awesome and they are a good band. The CD either will have a hiss or have a static sound for a split second, or during a song it'll cut in and out, or skip back for what is probably just a millisecond, but it is noticeable. I really hate to say it, but do not purchase this CD until they have fixed the issue. I am downloading the album as we speak on a file sharing website to see if it is any better. Stay heavy my friends."
5,Killer Tracks...,A great album for an amazing band. This was the last one of their albums I picked up (I had everything else) and of course...I loved it. Give it a go why don't ya.
3,Tar Heel Fans,"If you are a baskeball fan of the North Carolina Tarheels you will find this book a funny, light read, that you do not have to read from front to back."
3,Ehhh...,"When he stuck to covering the teams and the rivalry, it was a really good book. Unfortunately he felt the need to throw in politics and religion as often as possible. I agree with all of his views...but, when I buy a book about sports, I don't want it to be packed with political opinions. That's why I buy political books."
5,Loving the hate,"The first chapter of this book is worth the entire price. Laugh out loud funny. And then Will Blythe digs into the paradoxes and subtleties of what hating Duke, er, Dook (yes, I'm a Carolina alum), really means to him, even after he gets to know the personalities he loves to hate. Where does he wind up? Well, I won't give it away but believe me, he doesn't lose any of his passion for the Tar Heels. This is a must read for any Carolina fan. Similarly obsessed Dook fans will appreciate it as well. And curious outsiders who want an insider's view of what it's like to live inside the crazed, obseesive heart of the ACC won't regret a page of this book. Great writing from a fan in search of himself and an understanding of his loyalty to a team, a school, a region and a way of life that his recently deceased father taught him to love."
4,"UNC Worhsip, but funny","This book made me laugh out loud several times. I did get a little tired of his worship of UNC basketball and Dean Smith. The book was best when he remembered what it was about; the hatred between Duke and UNC. There were times he sort of wandered off into other areas, like his relationship with his father, and he described many more UNC games than Duke games. I thought the insight into certain players was done well though, JJ Redick, Melvin Scott, Sean May, for example. And he did do a pretty good job of researching and exploring the emotion of hatred, in a light hearted way. It was a good read."
5,Subjectivity be darned!,"As a former Californian, I never quite understood the vitriol of the USC/UCLA rivalry. To me, they were just two L.A. universities. But TO HATE LIKE THIS lays bare the raw emotions that can stir when two high-profile schools are geographically close to each other. It only inflames matters more when one is a public university (UCLA, North Carolina), while its rival is a private school (USC, Duke.)Will Blythe is a genuinely funny writer, but this is not just a humorous sports book. Rather, it is both a careful examination of North Carolina's culture and an exploration of the transcendental passion that can be enjoyed by the rabid, partisan sports fan.Really well done."
4,Mostly what I expected,"I was hoping to actually se some more analysis on the rivalry, but instead was mostly greeted with lots of commentary about the rivalry and its past. Granted, I was expecting that, but just had hoped that this book would address things from a quantitative perspective as well."
5,Great Book. Great Series.,"This is a great book from a great series. My 9 year old son loves them. He took the books every time we went on a road trip, read them before bed, he was even reading them instead of watching afterschool cartoons! They are well written and funny."
3,Wedding Issue,"In this installment of the series Wiglaf is betrothed to the homely Princess Belcheena through the scheming designs of greedy grown-ups, and must figure a way out of the predicament before the wedding date. More Nick at Night humor and several new characters are introduced. The DSA yearbooks at the end of these books are a nice touch, and the advertisements in the back are mildly amusing. The stories are rather formulaic and the humor a bit predictable, but it might be good for children who are just beginning to read chapter books and are having trouble being weened off of TV.In my humble opinion, the following author is probably a better choice for campy, kid-based, medieval humor;Time Warp Trio Gift Set, Books 1-4 (Knights of the Kitchen Table; The Not-So-Jolly Rodger; The Good, the Bad, and the Goofy; Your Mother Was a Neanderthal)J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"
4,Wacky Fun Read,"My nine year old son loves these books. I read this one to him for bedtime and I got a kick out of it myself. It was kind of predictable from an adult perspective but the kids didn't seem to catch on and were surprised as the story progressed. It's wacky and bizarre enough to appeal to young preteen males and fun for girls too with the medieval setting and the girl in disguise character, Erica AKA Eric. I was able to follow along without reading all the other books in the series. With a mood ring, greedy headmaster and any princess who could be a ""Belch-eena"" you know you're in for a funny read."
2,"Its ok, BUT...","Fun With Hypnosis is ok, It does explain some of the basics of hypnosis, and it gives a short history as well, it even gives you a few scripts. But this is not a good book for you to begin your understanding of hypnosis. When I first started with hypnosis I bought this book first. I wish I hadnt. It was dissapointing. A better choice for the new hypnotist or the curious is Hypnotherapy by David Elman, or Hypnosis for change by Josie Hadley and Carol Staudacher, or even Handbook of Hypnotic Suggestions and Metaphors by D. Corydon Hammond (Its worth it for anyone that is interested in clinical hypnosis.) I have bought over 35 books on the subject. And this one is the one I disliked the most. I hope this helps. Good Luck and Good Day!"
2,Be careful when reading customer reviews,"The book has a few hypno scripts and that's it. (hypno scripts are available everywhere from the net for FREE)Unfortunately he is not Professor Svengali and his real name is David Geliebter, again if the name is real at all. When an author does not even put his/her real name on the cover of a book, it sure tells something about the quality of it, especially with reader reviews filled with phrases such as ""Must buy it"" or ""The Best Book.""If I were to spend my hard earned money on learning hypnosis, the best is to learn it from a real person and stick with books written by the real professional such as Ormond McGill. Also always check out net resources (e.g. FAQ) for hypno book recommendation before buying any."
2,"meh, not as good as it looks",I have bought a few books on hypnotism and this is the worse one. Sure it gives you some scripts to use but if your actually interested in understanding hypnosis I would find another book.
5,Buy it NOW! It worked first time around!,"This book is a true gem. Despite the authors inability to spell and punctuate, it serves it's purpose. A collegue of mine is a certified hypnosis instructor and offers classes and is able to certify and license people. He was skeptical, but after reading this book, and with no... classes, I pased his test and am now a certified hypnotist. By following the book's instruction carefully, I truly believe anyone can hypnotise people. Since buying this book, I have tried over 50 times to hypnotise people and have never failed! I am the hit of every party and you can be too. GET THIS BOOK!"
3,Fun but text only,"Hypnosis stage show is a very funny and visual entertainment. However I can only use of my imagination to crate the show in my brain. If there are some demo pictures to show us how are the effect of the scripts. The book would be better.And if the book can cut down some ""word by word"" speech, it would be the best thing."
4,A nice introduction,"This book offers some basic knowledge for anyone trying to enter the field of hypnosis, but that's all. It could offer more theoretical background, but instead, it only shares some basic history and foundations, and a lot of practical information. The book aims, in the end, to a broad, general audience; still I think it treats the topic -hypnosis- more lightly than it should.Overall, a good, practical reading."
2,its decent,"this book is okay. after three attempts, i still haven't hypnotized anyone. i don't know what im doing wrong. oh well."
4,Fun With Hypnosis,"When I first bought this book I was really excited. I read it and then I tried to hypnotise someone. It took me a couple of tries (and well over an hour) but I finally did it. Don't think that this book will make hypnosis as easy as it sounds. Hypnosis is a complicated thing. This book will help you a lot, and with any luck at all you will be able to hypnotise someone."
5,"Amazing, fun, and user friendly!","I recieved the book on a Tuesday, that Saturday I was hypnotizing my family. I was interested in the self hypnosis section, but can tell I will have much more fun with the Stage performances. If you have ever watched a stage show in hypnosis and wondered ""how did he do that?"" Then get this book! Simply Amazing!"
4,Party entertainers only,"A shameless crowd pleaser. A good book if you're looking to become the party entertainer, it offers quick and simple instructions on performance hypnosis. It won't convince you of the healing or therapeutic properties of hypnosis but will reveal some tricks to have an audience believe you can pull off an impressive stunt."
3,my honest apprasal,I found this book seemed to accurate in pricable. however i think it would require you to work out your own take on the scripts and stage acts suggested because most of them are pretty lame and would'nt work on 90% of people for that reason. If you have the right personality and you are reltivly bright i think that what you learn in this book might teach you to hypnotise some one. This is only my percived opion from some one whos not a hypnotist. there seem to be alot people reviewing this book saying it not the first book on hypnotism you should buy. i think its fair to say as someone who did by this as there book on hypnoitism that its fine as a first book just expect to buy another if really want to learn the subject.
4,HELP i want to know more,dear sir who have read the book. first of all do i have to use a disk or computer in order to hypnotize another person. or does he have another non computer tecniqe? do you think that a novice could hypnotise almost anyone after reading this book. thanks from danny 73
5,It Really Works!!,"When I first picked this book, I thought that there was no way it would work. I read through a little bit and took note of the dialog. When I finally did get one of my friends agree to let me put him under, it took a few trys, but he really went into a trance. Everyone else was amazed and I brought him out of it. I have had no previous experience with hypnosis and was able to put someone under.This book is great."
5,one of the best books i've ever read on the subject,"extremely entertaining. and very easy to understand. the self hypnosis chapter was extremely helpful, in many ways.i would recomend this book for its contents for it;s value in knowledge and entertainment."
3,nice but too loud,"the fan is just as portrayed. A good price and sturdy. However, even on the lowest setting it is too noisey to sleep with. We like air circulating in our bedroom over night. the fan that finally gave out after many years was barely audible. This replacement is much louder. we keep it behind a big chair now to buffer some of the sound."
1,Mine only lasted 2 months!,I bought this fan for my office here in Phoenix. It looked great and worked great for about 2 months before it died. Now it sits silently like a piece of sculpture in the corner of my desk. Totally useless.
3,"Story was good, binding was loose",I liked the story. The book was out of print so I had to buy it used. The glue on the binding was dried up and pages were falling out upon arrival.
5,Strong work,"Love having this book on the wards! Swear! Detailed enough for home/ downtime reading, and still user friendly enough to quickly look pretty much anything I've needed or wanted on the fly. Real useful to have along on morning rounds and noon report as well.Its layout is a kinda sectional multi-bullet form that works nicely, especially in the face of ALL the info in there."
4,The Consult Manual of Internal Medicine,overall a solid book. not one you want to keep in your lab coat. but it tells you what you need to know
5,Very solid book,"This book is KING! I could sit here and type paragraphs upon paragraphs praising how useful this book is but that would do you no good. It's true, I bought this book after reading reviews, but it was only after I started using it when i was really convinced how ""awesome"" this book really is. I love it! I'm sure you will too! A great book for any medical student!"
2,Missing key topics,"This book has some incredibly important topics missing making it useless as a stand alone reference. Topics missing include syncopy (one of the most common complaints with hospital admissions), pulmonary hypertension, and the entire endocrine system except for the thyroid. I know that endocrine disorders may not be super common, but to delete cushings and addisons seems to be leaving out not unimportant topics. The book is not small, nor light, so it too big to carry on rounds anyway, but i might have made an effort if I thought it was complete. I don't think Pocket Medicine has all the answers, but it at least has all the topics. Stick to Pocket Medicine and buy a more complete reference on the side. This isn't it!"
2,A Disappointing conclusion,"Although the animation and storyline faithfully follow along the same timeline. This production was made without any of the original voices from the previous two series so I felt like these were strangers. Like many people, I have fond memories as a child watching this cartoon series but as I watched the Bolar Wars series, I couldn't get into it because I didn't believe I was watching the adventures of Wildstar, Venture, Sandor, Nova and the rest of the crew. END"
4,Bolar war,something new for me after all these years . but try to catch up on the first two series. It's looks goodmust have to complete the entire series.
2,Southern view of history,"This looks to be just another look at the Northern re-write of history after the war. I would not recommend this to anyone wanting anything different than the standard Post-war Nothern view. If that ""New York"" view of southern history is what you are looking for then this is probably something for you. Otherwise I would recommend a much better and more informative and well researched book by Paul R. Peterson on the topic which includes 500 pages of well done research from several points of view. It is not boaring and offers a refreshing alternative to the politically correct and ""parrotted"" version that we often see re-published every few years."
5,"ALLEN WEST IS NOWHERE NEAR THIS ALBUM, YESSSS!","LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, JAMES MURPHY, GUITAR GOD, WAS LET GO TO LET WHO BACK IN THE BAND? OH NO, SAY IT AIN'T SO! ANYWAY, THIS IS THE BEST CD OBITUARY HAS EVER WRITTEN, RECORDED, AND RELEASED. THE ALBUM IS JUST FLAT OUT AWESOME. I STILL JAM IT TO THIS VERY DAY, AND I'VE HAD THE ALBUM SINCE '91. YES MY FRIENDS, ALLEN WEST WAS NOT ON THIS ALBUM, IF HE WAS, WELL, I DON'T KNOW. BUT LET ME JUST SAY THAT JAMES MURPHY HAS TAKEN THIS ALBUM TO NEW HEIGHTS. HE DID NOT SAVE THIS ALBUM, HE JUST IMPROVED IT. HIS MASTERY OF THE GUITAR MAKES ALLEN WEST LOOK SO BAD, SO, SO BAD. THIS ALBUM IS SO INTENSE. THIS ALBUM HAS THE FLAMES OF HELL RIDING ON ITS HEELS. I WANT THIS ALBUM PLAYED AT MY FUNERAL. I WANT TO BE BURRIED WITH A COPY OF THIS CD SO SATAN AND I CAN JAM TOGETHER. ROCK ON!!!!!!!"
5,The way Death Metal was meant to be.,"This is the way Death Metal was meant to be.... Ok if his voice was to high for Death Metal,than so is Chuck Schuldiners voice,Cause John Tardy did basically the same vocal style,half scream,half growl,which we all know Chuck Schuldiners voice was awsome,so Johns is just as good if not better,I mean Chuck was a great vocalist,and im a big fan of his,but Tardys vocals just own,This is the way Death Metal was meant to be,along with Suffocation,Malevolent Creation,Death,....,Grindcore is just boring,and repetive,I love ALL Obituarys albums,but Slowly We Rot,and Cause Of Death are my favs,Also check out some old Sepultura,Suffocation,Death,Malevolent Creation,peace."
5,cool album,"this album is cool buy it hey! wait a second they stole that album cover from the 97 reissues of those H.P. LOVECRAFT books this makes them look like thieves,cool"
4,Wow!,"D*mn, this was brutal back in 1990! What still strikes me about this record is John Tardy's low powerful gutteral growl. You just have to hear that.On successive listens other pieces of quality will begin to appear, like the playing of legendary death-metal guitarist James Murphy, or tight and inventive drumming (if I'm not mistaken, that's John's brother Donald behind the kits). The hardest thing about this album is telling where the track ends and the next one starts.Few bands from Florida managed to put out a better death album. While I still think the succeeding Obituary's ""The End Complete"" is way better record."
5,Obituary's best,"This is definitely Obituary's coolest album. Don Tardy's double bass is perfect, the guitars are super heavy and John Tardy's vocals are wonderfully sickening. Who cares if you can't understand the words..."
4,Absolute masterpiece,"The reason I like this cd so much is because it is simply one of the heaviset records i have ever heard. The drummer donald Tardy, and singer John of the same name do great things on this record. Along with the other members they make a great album, which after all this time since it was released in 1990, sounds very good. It's remastered now so it even sounds better. Hope you like it.Although this genre is not my ideal music listening, you cannot ignore it. Obituary will split your head in half while listening to it because it is so heavy and so well played.People could do comparisons w/ other groups of this genre like Slayer, but obituary is somewhat above Slayer. Slayer is good, but Obituary is much more extreme. It's like a comparison between Led Zeppelin and P Floyd. Zeppelin is classic r&r, and Floyd is MUCH more."
4,Works great!,"I didn't install it myself, but it works great and de-fogs my small bathroom in no time. I am very happy with the purchase."
2,Not Quite enough,"A little too loud, 250W Heat Lamp insufficient for our application - replaced with a Panasonic .7 sones, 1500W Heater, 100 CFM"
1,Don't understand the remastering job.,"I did not own the original album release of ""What's Going On"", so I do not know what the album is supposed to sound like. When I bought the 1998 Remaster CD release, however, all the songs had been cut up to play continuously instead of individually. For half of the songs this works ok, nothing is lost, but for two songs in particular--""Save the Children"" and ""God is Love""--lyrics, dutifully printed in the insert, have been cut from the end of the song. (""Save"" loses 2 lines, ""God"" loses a whole stanza.) You may want to look into a different edition of this fantastic album."
5,The greatest R&B album EVER!,"While I am not a fan of soul music or R&B in general, this album is one of the few exceptions. Marvin Gaye pours his inner soul and feelings into his greatest work. Inner City Blues is a gem. As is the title track. This album is consistently voted in the top ten greatest albums of alltime polls. And its definately worthy, as it makes a statement more so than many other albums found in those polls, Bob Dylan being an exception. This album will remain one of the best recordings ever."
5,Velvet gloves,"Gaye's personal/political tract surprises with its mellow tones wrapped around stinging lyrics. He never sang or wrote better than this. A brilliant effort, and my nomination as the best album of the Rock era."
4,Classic album with amazing sound quality...,We all love this album or else you wouldn't be reading this but with so many versions out there which one should you buy?This hybrid SACD (also playable on any CD player or computer) is the ultimate version pertaining to sound quality. The new Mobile Fiselity Sound Labs (MoFi or MFSL) has been hitting things out of the park lately. This release is about as good as it gets. Their new mastering engineer Rob LoVerde mastered the SACD and vinyl editions from the original master tapes and presented us with a clear and dynamic disc. I'm not sure how you could make these tapes sound any better.Thanks for another fantastic release MoFi!
2,disappointed,"As I am a big fan of Marvin Gaye, it was difficult to give this recording only two stars, but 1st of all there was no warning on Amazon that this was a stereo only sacd, which I don't buy usually. That said, I have an SACD by the rock band Boston, which is recorded in stereo only and the sound quality is leaps and bounds better than the standard CD version.This Marvin Gaye SACD, I compared to other recordigs I have of him on CD and I can detect little or no difference.I was disappointed by this purchase."
5,This version is the one to get,"many different versions of this CLASSIC album are available....this is the one to get.Bonus tracks , a near complete concert, two different mixes of the actual album.....snatch it up before it goes away."
3,Love the songs but like the original version better.,"I always loved this album, but in the remastering attenuates the emotion driving bass playing of the great James Jamerson. I think that was a critical error because the recording lacks the emotional depth of the original recording. The better buy is the DELUXE version of this album. You get this version and the original version plus a bunch of other cuts on two disks. This one only gives you two bonus cuts."
5,The Greatest,"I heard this album the minute it came out and have been a fan ever since. I also have seen Marvin in Concert in the 70's at Radio City, in New York."
2,So-so.,"This is supposed to be a 'classic' album, but I must admit to some disappointment. I am a great fan of Marvin, but not really this time."
2,No resonance,"Sorry, but this album was a big disappointment! All the rave reviews here on Amazon inspired me to buy this album...but having listened to it very few of the songs in this album are anywhere near a 5 star rating. Most of the songs leave me cold somehow...they just don't resonate with my feelings. Buy e.g. Otis Redding instead."
5,lovely package,"Yes, this is a great release. The detroit mix to my mind is quite different. It's funkier with less emphasis on the sweetness of the strings, less produced basically. The remastered sound on the orig lp is less bassy compared to the 20-bit version, i dont think this is a deliberate thing probably just the 24-bit remastering makes it clearer,still sounds just as full though."
5,"Should be part of American History, and one of the greatest albums of all-time","1.) This should be taught in schools.2.) One of the most cohesive albums I've ever heard. A true, true, true classic."
3,Confusing book,"This storyline leads to great adventures but some confusing endings. For example, in one ending when you were waked up from your dream by Billy who was supposed to be stay kidnapped. And another ending has put the reader and Billy in a plane after waking up from a dream. If that is so, then the other endings were part of a dream?But the Frank Bolle's artwork is wonderful and crisp as always. I loved his artwork in other books. I liked Ling very much. I enjoyed having an interactive relationship with Ling. I was hoping for a romance with Ling."
5,"It is not just a book, it is a guide for happiness.",Both Katherine and her work are like a flower that has grown within the weeds that make up life.
1,Product misrepresented.,The product is misrepresented as a custom fit liner. It is a universal fit that must be cut to fit my Toyota Highlander. This is completely unacceptable and I am attempting to return the item.
5,Best Sepultura album ever!,If you are a metal maniac like I am this album is one that is definately needed in your collection.
5,THIS is what Progressive Music is ABOUT!!!!!,"No rules, awesome playing, new melodies, fresh thinking, and even a slightly cynical yet humorous message.This reminds me of some of the more creative bands of the mid 70s. This is a more cohesive production than Winds, which most of the members were participants in. I hope this is not a 1 shot deal with this band/concept. I want more....If you like creative music, that has no pre conceived notions (Event, Mars Volta, Mid 80s Crimson, etc) then you will certainly love this from the first listen."
3,Muir Review,"Not a bad book, the sourcing and footnotes need work. Muir did this study before PC took hold in recent culture. His conclusions at the end would disqualify him in the eyes of many. This isn't to say he didn't have a lot to offer. Used the primary sources of old recorders of the Caliph's.I used this book as a supplement to other such as Madelung."
5,Good ol' Days,"I was lucky enough to live in San Diego during the ""next Seattle Years"". I saw all of the SD bands and their offshoots during that time. When Jehu played you DID NOT miss that show. Jehu is one of my favorite bands of all time. Jehu's music is as good to me now as it was over ten years ago. I would go anywhere to see them live one more time. If you managed to read all of the reviews on Jehu here, you already know what I mean."
5,So damn good it hurts,"I've had this album for a couple of years now -having been introduced to them through the Hot Snakes. It is simply one of the best albums in my collection. This album is what rock should be. It is like Coletrain, you can appreciate the mastery from the first listen, but the intricacy can only be understood after hundreds of listens. Mark Trombino is simply one of the finest drummers ever. It is a true shame that he is now only producing. This album is like In On the Killtaker era Fugazi, but dare I say . . . even better. More creative, more on the ragged edge, pure cathartic energy beating your head 'till it is bloody. Interscope was a pack of fools to ever let them go. Far better than the Hot Snakes (though I love them dearly). Buy this album now - hell buy two in case the first one gets scratched. If post-punk/mathrock is you're thang, you're never going to want to take this one out of your stereo."
5,My daughter loves this book!,My daughter loves this book even though she is not adopted. I am a single mom. We read this book and talk about how parents really want to have children and how there are different types of families.
1,Rusting,"I purchased these 15 months ago and within 1 year they began to show signs of rust.I would not purchase. Amazon was of little help, they recommended contacting Weston to resolve."
1,A real downer!,"This book is such a downer. Besides the ridiculous sibling rivalry between two grown-up sisters, and all of the complicated problems between Julie & Romeo's families, we have an eight-year old, Sarah, running the show in Julie's house. Besides watching Charlie & the Chocolate Factory endlessly, she manipulates adults in to buying her lottery tickets!! They have their very own Veruca Salt living in that house!!If you want to read a depressing story about an extremely dysfunctional family and a woman with no backbone, this is the book for you. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first one."
4,"Nothing New, But Very Engaging","I had no doubt how this book would end. The author has written an engaging novel with well-developed characters, some of whom are somewhat unique without being implausible. Her style is warmand the book clips along at a happy pace.In fact, I just finished it; it took less than two hours to read, and I enjoyed every minute. This is the sequel to Julie and Romeo, another charming fast read. While you could read this one first, why would you?You do care about the characters and want everything to end happily, but there's no surprises or narrative tension. The one unpleasant character gets his comeuppance and is a bit of a caricature (one hopes). Reading this book is a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon."
2,Not her best,I loved the first book (and all of her other works) but this one while it held my attention also annoyed me.Way too much time was given to the spoiled little girl and she lost me from the very beginning when it was explained that if she didn't get to watch the movie every day she screamed.Sadly the adults were almost as spoiled as the children and it was hard to feel any kind of sympathy or empathy for the main character when she was the one who had created these brats.
3,Pleasant,"A pleasant and clean read. Situations resolve a bit too easily, but a nice, non-stressful way to pass some reading time."
4,Raised lots of questions,"Was anyone else wondering why they didn't just get Sarah a pair of earphones so her obsessive viewing of her movie wouldn't bother so many people to the extent it did? And did anyone else wonder why Julie would permit herself to be treated as a menial slave to her (extremely) wealthy daughter? As Sandy pointed out, Nora and Alex could easily afford to have a live in health care provider. When Nora snapped at her mother (literally snapped her fingers!), I thought Julie would finally grow a backbone and say something. That really, really gives mothers a bad name. I was delighted to see, at least, that Romeo's mother is losing her senses so she didn't realize she was in Julie's home when she visited the ailing Romeo. Interestingly, Julie wasn't really the star of this second helping of the Julie/Romeo saga. Plummy stole the entire plot line. I sincerely hope there is a Plummy-centric book in our future."
2,Disappointing Sequel,"I've loved Jeanne Ray's other books (Julie & Romeo, Step Ball Change, and Eat Cake). I found them all to be well written, funny and entertaining reads, with varied and likeable characters. This book doesn't come close to meeting the standard set by the others. It isn't funny at all. All of the characters act horribly, including the martyred Julie who lets everyone in her family walk all over her. I haven't read a book in a long time where I didn't like a single character. (And I liked these people in the first book - Julie and Romeo). I highly recommend her other books, but I'd stay away from this one."
2,Julie and Romeo Get Lucky,"I have enjoyed Jeanne Ray's other novels; light and entertaining family fare. This latest one is a bit ridiculous: the grown children are needy and demanding, Julie enjoys her role as a door mat, and the entire household is being held hostage by the obnoxious 8 year old grandchild!"
3,Julie and Romeo Get Lucky,"This was a ""follow up"" novel to ""Romeo and Julie"". The first novel was very funny and a breath of fresh air. This novel had it's amusing moments, but overall did not compare to the first one. The first part of the book was somewhat believable but the sub-plot was too much for anyone to swallow. Romeo's mother in this novel made a quick and undramatic apperance which was disappointing (too much potential was lost). Jeanne Ray should have quit while she was ahead."
3,Tish,"Not bad, but kind of adolescent. The author must think we won't keep reading if somebody doesn't die or the hero doesn't get beat up every few pages. And what is with his girlfriend? Almost everything she says and does is moronic or inappropriate. I have a long list of detectives with annoying girlfriends, but Kathy takes the cake.The plot was pretty good -- well thought out, interesting, moved right along. And Thomas Black is a likable character. This was my first Earl Emerson book. I'll probably read more, but these books will be on my B-list."
4,Great Book,The Kassandra is a much more complex character than the others in the trilogy. She has many sides to her personality and the story line has a lot of things going on in it because of her duty to her country of Akora. Thehistorical back drop is also interesting and the social situation of the time is intriging. I feel the best part is whenshe returns to Akora because that is when everything starts to unfold.
1,Kingdon of Moonlight,Don't waste your time. I had the hardest time picking up this book. Usually I can read a book in 8 hours and this one was so boring I actually did some housework. I just couldn't finish it which is a first for me.
3,OK,"I was super excited to order this book, was disappointed when I got it because it was a dr. office version, meaning it had about 20 pages of postcards in the middle of the book for people to be able to pull out and send in for free book. Still wanted the book so didn't send back, but it's a little distracting reading to our kids with them in it!"
2,logic and Spinoza,"This is a readable account of Spinnoza's view on religion, but in my opinion, the Author is more interested in Logic than in Spinoza's thought. We are often served with a critic of one statement after another without any more. I have learn about religion and imagination, for instance, in Lorenzo Vinciguerra's Spinoza et le signe, Vrin, Paris, 2005."
5,A Treasure Trove!,"Conversations with Yogananda picks up where The Essence of Self-Realization left off. Once again, Swami Kriyananada has delved into his old notebooks in which he had faithfully recorded his master's words, gathered the pearls lying there, polished them off, and laid them out under a brilliant light for our appreciation and edification. Once again, Paramhansa Yogananda manifests a supremely subtle grasp of deep spiritual truths and how they apply to various situations of daily life. I cannot conceive of a better introduction to the mind and heart of Yogananda, or of any other self-realized saint. This book is a treasure trove. If your goal is to grow spiritually, buy it now.Richard Salva--author of Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh [UNABRIDGED]"
1,Not What I Expected,This book is a long-winded way of exploring the Kings Quest series. With NO illustrations I was disappointed with this book.I thought we may have gotten an insight into characters and places with pictures and drawings from the storyboard stages.NO WAY! The only tid bit of information that seemed interesting was on the lost plot in Kings Quest 6 (the best game). Only buy this book if you need help on getting through all seven games.
1,I'm a big fan of the KQ series...,"...However, I've never really liked the KQ companion series of books. I just prefer to make up my own backstories for the events that occur in the games."
2,"Music nice, words awful.","The background music is sweet, but the lyrics are dreadful. There's nothing wrong with her voice, the song just doesn't flow well. This has to be the worst single released by 4 Strings to date. I was eagerly awaiting their new CD, and still am, however their first choice for a single was not a good one. Let's hope the new album is not more of this. Don't pass up their CD Believe if you don't already have it. It has to be in the top 25 dance/trance albums of all time."
4,Another excellent dance vocal trance music!!,"4 strings caught my attention when i first listened to her single 'let it rain'. Fantastic song, love it! Then i checked out her next single 'turn it around', another excellent dance tune. The music is super, very catchy, the vocal is fantastic, a sure must at the dance floor. This song has released with multiple mixes, but my favourites are the extended mix and the Dj 4 strings vocal mix. Check out her 2 new songs, available as 12"" at this moment: 'sunrise', and 'until you love me'. Both songs are super! top notch! i can't wait for the cd singles to be released. 4 strings - man, you're good!"
4,Very Good and Very Applicable,"Very good book...everything is well explained. I like the inclusion of real documents shown in figures, which not only enhance the understanding and making it more practical to apply. Also have many interesting old pictures and stories relating to construction which is a nice break for the reading."
1,The worst book in the world,"I cannot believe I'm paid $160 for a paperback book. Even if the book was a hard copy I would not pay ten bucks for it. But let's talk about the book content now. Every chapter is so irrelevant, so outdated, and you have to search the internet to find the knowledge gaps that the author leaves. Also the book doesn't include examples that could complement the theory and the problems of each chapter, just hold on, this is incredible,the chapter problems are the most ackward, rare,irrelevant, clumsy that I ever seen. Oh, and you don't get to see at the end of the book the answers to the problems, so you will never know if you got it right. Honestly, I feel I've been robbed, the first days with this book I thought this was a joke or that someone made a mistake and printed other thing.I've seen a lot of bad books in my career but this one is by far the worst. Avoid this book as long as you can and find other more well versed books."
2,False Advertising,"The product name included the phrase ""with sisal"". The stated product dimensions were 18x18x16 inches (or 15x15x17, depending on which part of the product page you read). The picture clearly shows a hole at the top of the product. What I was expecting was something similar to the condo part of a Molly and Friends model 36 cat tree (which I'd be satisfied with, even if it didn't have sisal on it). What I received doesn't have sisal, has dimensions of around 14x14x11.5 inches, and doesn't have a hole on the top (which is important, if you have a multi-cat household and don't want a cat to be trapped by one of the others). The top part of the inside doesn't even have carpet on it."
3,fillerup,Besides the 4 hits the cd is loaded with filler. Would have been a more effective as a single cd.
5,Preparation/Warm Embrace,"I was so impressed with this book I called family members/ friends and read certain pages to them. The topic I am wrting on in my action research, caring/teaching caring in the classroom, made this book exceptional."
2,Too Slow Paced for Me,"There were four of us who watched this movie for awhile but then we all agreed it was moving along at such a slow pace that we should stop it before it was finished. I don't know how it ends, I'll admit that, but the sad part is I'm not even interested enough in the characters to care what happened to them.The situations seem very contrived and caused me to lose interest in their dilemma and any possible outcome. I suggest you watch this one before you buy it. Some other reviewers seemed impressed and I'm happy they found something in it to like but it just didn't work for me."
2,MUDDLED MESS,"To compare this film to Hitchcock is really misguided IMHO. Hitchcock's movies ultimately made sense---this mess wanders aimlessly to a contrived and flat climax.Poor Brittany Murphy looks totally lost and her performance is surprisingly dull. The movie is slow albeit moody at times. Thora Birch tries hard but can't overcome the subaverage script. The use of video-cameras in movies is getting tiresome and overdone. Overall, a disappointing film."
2,"OKAY FOR A ""B"" DIRECT TO DVD MOVIE","I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE TO MAKE MY OWN OPINION, AFTER READING SO MANY BAD REVIEWS. FIRST THE LATE GREAT BRITTANY MURHPY'S ACTING IS ""HORRID"" AND HER APPEARANCE IS TOO SAD TO SEE ON FILM. SECOND ACTRESS THORA BIRCH AND TAMMY BIANCHARD'S CHARACTERS ARE WELL PLAYED, BUT ""POINTLESS"". THREE THE ENDING ""WAS NOT A TWIST"", BUT CONFUSING, LEAVING EVERY DETAIL FROM THE PLOT----""PLOTLESS"". FOUR IF YOUR A ""BIG BRITTANY MURPHY FAN AND PURCHASED THIS DVD ON A ""VERY CHEAP SALE"", LIKE I DID, THEN IT IS FAIR TO OWN, BUT IF YOUR NOT A MURPHY FAN THIS MOVIE IS FAIR TO RENT."
1,Save Your Money,"I don't like to write negative reviews, but maybe this will save someone a few bucks. I loved Brittany Murphy in ""Ramen Girl"" where her talent came through. I'm still trying to figure out the point to this lame movie which builds the mood up just to let the viewer down. Poor Brittany, she should have passed up this film; her horrible lip job combined with her sickly look was a disservice to her."
4,"""A Haunted Mansion"".","This is a dark,scary movie starring the late actress Brittany Murphy as Alice in ""Deadline"". Alice is a struggling author who is recovering from psychological breakdown, needs inspiration to finish her screenplay in time against a fast approaching ""Deadline""! She stays in a spooky victorian mansion in the middle of nowhere, but things start to happen : strange noises, creaky doors, moving furniture & other paranormal things which make her mind to run wild! This is a slowly evolving scary movie that also features Thora Birch & Sean McConville, will thrill ""ghost/spooky"" story loving fans.The story has a good plot, but the story rather develops slowly & intruiging at the same time."
3,Deadline,My oldest daughter and I watched this together and we liked it .It's a dark movie I have saw the comments about how bad Brittany Murphy looked please know the description of the movie said she was recovering from a psychological breakdown .She was the main character not a lot of talking you have to sit and watch this otherwise you'll be lost .If you are one of those kinds of people who enjoy watching a movie that makes you think by all means buy it .
2,Not for inspiration,"This book uses photographs by one of the century's greatest artists. Not just photographers. But the sad part about it is, and this was made perfectly clear by him - there is no mistake - he DID NOT want it to be published. Why? According to his nurse/assistant/friend/biographer Mary Street Alinder he did not wish them to be published because the color photographs were not good examples of his vision.Sophistry will never be able to compensate for the point that he didn't want it published. No amount of money made will justify it. Historical value yes. Ansel's vision on a new level? Hardly.At best it's a curiosity. Like listening to Beehthoven plink on the piano coming up with another passage. A symphony it ain't. And Ansel, of all people, is the lesser for it if it's ever put forward as art, and not simply as history."
4,A work in progress,"I got a copy of this recently and it is a truly interesting book.The use of colour displays a profound vision and shows a greatunderstanding of the necessity for colours to work together in an image,sometimes harmoniously, sometimes in contrast.It is truly as great as the B&W; work Adams is so well known for?To be honest no, but he was still working towards a vision ofhow to use colour in his work, so it remains a work in progress.Given another 50 years I have no doubt that Adams would havecolour work every bit as good as his B&W.;You could learn a lot from the images in this book, possiblyall the more because it isn't a really polished work which canseem a bit inaccesible to us lesser mortals."
4,Waiting,"This is the story of Sir Alfred Merhan, the man who has been stuck at Charles de Gaulle for over 16 years. His story was the inspiriation behind the movie The Terminal.It is a easy to read account of his life leading up to arriving at the airport, as well as the various accounts of him trying to leave and obtain citizenship in various locations. For anyone who has spent any time in an airport, this book will make you apprecaiate your departures.Ironically, I picked this book up in an airport bookstore and finished it on a plane."
5,"Big tone, lots of volume, reasonable price",I bought this speaker to replace the stock speaker in a Fender Excelsior amplifier. It's easily 10dB louder than the stock speaker and sounds noticeably better.
3,Good vocal experiment from Karma To Burn.,This is a good album but it is not their best. The vocals are not by the singer of Kyuss but he is gone now. They were also instrumental before this and I think the instrumental stuff is superior.
3,Hmmm......,"I took a chance on this disc because it got a fairly good review. Only tracks 1 and 11 got my attention. Despite what other reviewers have said, I liked the vocalist particularly on track 1."
2,Adult buys childs book by mistake!,"This small sized book is a little over 100 pages. It is written for about a fourth grade student. There is not much substance and may have been fine for elementary students in 1958 when it was published. So my warning for adults is, this is a child's book!"
1,I bought this game and returned it within three days,"I noticed everyone praising this game, talking about how it was so great and fun. I decided since everyone liked so would I and I picked it up. You can pet your dog which you achieve by rubbing the screen, you can feed your dog simply by clicking on the dogfood/water bowl, you can throw toys which it will fetch and bring back for you to throw again, you can take it on walks which consits of putting your stylus on the end of the leash and holding it there. The funnest parts of this game are the competitions in which you can do various acts to impress the judges. As I was playing the competitions, because it is the only somewhat fun thing to- I discovered you can only enter in the competitions three times in one day. After the discovery you can only have a slight amount of fun in this game three times per day, I returned it to the store for half my money back. I feel like I have wasted fifteen dollars."
1,bullcrap! don't waste your money,"soo i got this game from my friends and i really liked it but i wanted to start from the beggining. but at the beging yu have to choose the dogs name and say it lik seriously 60 times and if u says it wrong even once it makes you bassically start over because if u don't says is name every second of the dogs life it some how ""fogets it own name"". I wasx playing and in the end i was yelleing and screaming at my ds... this game pisses me off.. unless you have really really really really good patiencethen don't buy this."
2,INNOVATION DOES NOT EQUAL FUN,"They put so much work into making the dogs real they forgot to make the game fun. Lets see, you rub his head, throw it a toy, walk it and teach it up to 14 tricks. Wow. Barn-burning excitement. Mix in a dog show or two where you basically repeat all that stuff. Its different, its unique, its pretty impressive...but its not fun. Yeah, its an incredible advancement in artificial intelligence to program the dogs to act like the real things, but most of us have real pets anyways. Its a novelty game just like all of Nintendo's games. You open it, say ""thats a neat idea"" then trade it in a week later. Dont get me wrong, I dont hate it...its just boring. Its not a game, its an experience. A dull experience."
2,go go nintendogs,"Hi,well to start this toy is soooooo much fun!!!!!!!! My dog's name is Princess and she is sooooooooo cute !!!! She's learned so many tricks such as.... sit, lie down , shake, and roll over .But enough about my dog,let me tell you about the game. First of all you choose from a whole lot of breeds at the begining of the game. 2nd of all after you've chosen a dog,you teach it it's name and how to sit. 3rd you do whatever you want with it such as... giving it baths, feeding it, taking it for walks, buying it things to wear,and entering it in contests. Oh and if you win contests you get money. And if you save up enough money you can buy other dogs!!!! Anyway give in already and buy it,hope this was helpful. lol Brooke."
5,Researching DS,"I really like this game, but I don't have a DS. I'm trying to get my parents to give this to me, and meanwhile, I'm doing research about the game system and games, like reading reviews on Amazon. For those who are like me (DS-less), I suggest that they do the same to try to convince their parents. I would totally suggest people to buy the Nintendogs game, the dogs are just too cute to resist!"
5,great game,"this is a great game! the graphics are great, and its very fun! if your a dog lover or not, chances are youll love this game!"
4,Enjoyable game,"First off pay no attention to the review below about waiting for the PSP version. I don't know what ""Objective Gamer"" is thinking but Nintendogs is a Nintendo made product, hence the name NINTENdogs. Hell will freeze over and pigs will fly before you ever see a PSP version of this game. Honestly, PSP fanboys are everywhere and are very good at shoveling...well you know.As for the game itself, it is a joy to play. Pick from one of 6 breeds depending on your game version (All versions have all the breeds but the additional 12 not found in your version are unlocked via wireless or owner points). From there you use the stylus and microphone to play with your puppy, train him/her and compete in competitions. Very easy to get into and seeing your puppy respond you never gets old."
3,Nintendogs best friends,"Ok i know that this is Nintendogs dachshund and friends not best friendsBut i got the limeted edition and i can't review that and they are the same thing just deferent breeds. here is what the game is like. but I have restarted. and this time i have a dachshund.pros1 easy gameplay2 good graphecs3 you can unlock all breeds on any verson4 it is in real time5 you can have to 8 dogs6 you can unlock Jack Russle Terrier my fav breed Because i have one but i have not unlocked yet so if you know HELP!7 you can renovate your house but you have to unlock the houses.cons1 you can only have three dogs in your house at a time.2 the hotel sometimes you put a full non thersty beautyfull dog and then get it out the next day hungry thersty and dirty.3 it is hard to get dalmation, JRT (Jack Russle Terrier) and i had problems with chewawa not how you speel it i know.4 it does get boring cause it gets repetitive.Over all i would get it but only one verson if you love dogs"
4,jay review,"Its a really fun game you can take your dogs for a walk, put them in contests and win money for more dogs or supply for the dogs.you get to give them a bath, feed them, and brush their hair. This is a great game dont get me wrong, but if you already have a dog spend time with your real one, and either save this for the plane/car or dont buy it because the real dog is more important."
5,The Dog Master-Carlos Sirot NY,"This game rocks out loud!! This game was way worth the money! In this game, you get to train,care,brush,feed,water(etc.)your dog! I love this game! If you have a friend with a nintendog game, you and your friend could give each other the dogs you unlocked, give gifts and many more! Overall, I give this game 98 percent! By the way, you can have up to three dogs at your house and 5 at the dog hotel! This game lasts a very long time and I am still playing it. I got this game for my birthday and I am glad I wanted it!!!!"
5,THIS IS A GREAT GAME!!!!!!!!,"I really want this gane for Xmas this year, and so far i've heard it is soooooo much fun!!! I want the Dachshund & Friends version, and i think it's really cool!!! If you don't have a pet a home, then this a game for you!!!!!"
3,Nintendogs,"This is a good game if you are REALLY REALLY into dogs. I'm not. I like dogs but not so much. After 1-2 weeks I got tried of it. You get to do things with the dog but for me, I just didn't like it. If you are going to buy this for someone or for yourself make sure he/she or you are really into dogs."
4,This game is OK,"This game was nice, but it's alot more fun if you also buy the dog trainer, so you can unlock more stuff."
3,Could be better.,First I will tell you that you can unlock all the other breeds in this game.However it is VERY hard to unlock breeds.You don't have to feed your dogs every day but if you do not feed them in a while they run away.You can only have 8 dogs and you are never done with this game.If you already have a real dog I recommend not getting this game.
4,Innovative,"Yeah that's right. Virtual puppies! I know what you're thinking, ""just get a real dog!"" what about sony? they make toy dogs, don't they? ah ha ha, now we're getting somewhere. You know, that shows you guys you know nothing of sony history, even though you're fanboy. remember the toy dogs and see if you'll screw sony as well, you cheap b******s.and what's with ""nintendogs is coming psp. just you wait!""? Hmm... let's seeNintendo=NintendogsSony=SonygsSee something strange around here? Nintendogs belongs to Nintendo. If Sony got a game like this, it would be called SONYGS. WTH is the dog pun?Well, I guess I solved at least one of the problems on this review board. Later."
5,Perfect game.,"Can't put this one down!I highly recommend this game. Anyone who likes puppies will love this game!There is so much to do with your pet, and the game really keeps you wanting to play. Everyone we show the game to ends up getting one and loving it too.This is a huge hit in our family!"
4,The Nintendo DS Dogs,"This Nintendo game is fun for all ages. I really love this game!! I encourage you to buy this game for a present for your children who really like dogs. I have this game for myself and I have fallen in love with this game. You would definitely rate this a five star game!! I enjoy this game so much, I didn't want to leave it when it came to dinner! I just really cannot explain it, but you will love this game to!!"
5,GREAT THE BEST NINTENDO GAME EVER,"This game is the best nintendo game ever, as a teen, I enjoy this great game. the graphics are real like! you can teach your dogs tricks with voice command. enter agility, obediance, and disc ( frisbee) compettitions. Take a walk to the park, go to the store, practice agility, and even meet others on nintendogs by ""bark mode"" where you and another persons dog can play together. #1 BEFORE YOU BUY EITHER dauchson dalmation, lab or chiuaua, check out the already unocked dogs on the back of the box. wich your is your fav. kind of dog and check to see if its on the back of any nintendogs case. Dalmation one is the only one that has dalmation, although if you find a firemans hat on the walks, you will be able to buy dalmations. So, I consider you getting the dalmations one, because i have been playing for 2 years nintendogs, and still havent unlocked the dalmation."
3,Puppy Luv,"Nintendogs is a fun game, but it might be a little hard to use the stylus. The agility trial is the most fun of the contests. The obedience contest is the hardest. You can buy difference houses. You can donate your dog, or drop it off and switch for another dog. If you go on bark mode you can meet new friends with their dogs. You can go for walks and see different dogs and talk to their owners. You can go to dog parks and play with other people's dogs, throw toys and treats to them, or practice for competitions. I think it is one of the best games I've had."
4,a perfect simulation game/,"this game is great .nice graphic that mimic the real thing..lot stuffs to unlock.and ton of replay value..i din't own a dog.but after a day with this game,it me wana get a real thing...over all it an awsome game,the best pet simulators ever...to the dude who gave this game a bad review and say wait for the psp verion( you r nut,this game is made by nintendo, that is y it is call NINTENDOg,and there is no FCKing way in the world nintendo gana release it on the stupid psp.)(and this game is in 100% english)"
2,Penalties force game use,"My daughter loves this game but I hate it now that I know that if she doesn't turn it on for some time she receives penalties where the electronic dogs suffer and who knows what else--die? I bought the game with the understanding that it wouldn't become a substitute for more important activities, and now we can't even put it away for a few days because bad things will happen to these virtual pets. I absolutely hate this. The dogs seem pretty real in ways and the child grows to care about them. To be punished for not turning on a video game is a revolting concept--I would never buy anything with a similar feature again."
3,Fun........for about a month.,"I've had this game for 6 weeks and liked it very much. Graphics are good and it can be addictive. However, after about a month it can become somewhat boring. You MUST care for your pet on a daily basis which is fine at first, but it has become monotonous at this point. I had the impression it would be a game I'd enjoy for a longer period of time. Now I just feel rather obligated to care for the dogs. I no longer enjoy doing so."
5,long lasting entertainment,"I got this game for my two daughters, 7 and 12 years old. They both love it and it has held their interest for a lot longer than I thought it would. They put it away for a while but then go back just as interested as ever. I am getting another one with different dogs so they can trade and interact more since they both have a DS. Cant wait for the WII to come out!"
5,Nintendogs,"I really want a dog, but my mom doesn't want one. Sometimes, I don't feel like having a dog, so I turn the game off. When I want a dog, BAM! I can play. Also, my best friend has one, too. So we give each other stuff and have our dogs play together. It's really fun! I love this game. I think it would be really cool if you could design the house, though."
3,It's just like having a real dog,"I've always liked cats,(probably because I've had a cat,)but I recently wanted a pug. I got this game because I couldn't get a real pug. Now I know why. I really liked this game when I first got it. The graphics were great, and the pugs were so cute! Little did I know, Fred,the little black pug, would drive me crazy. I enjoyed nintendogs for about a week. With school and all, I barely had time to even feed the dog. I began to wish I could bring myself to delete the thing, but it was so cute, I couldn't do it. I was really starting to hate the thing because I had little free time, and I had to spend it taking care of the dog for what seemed to be hours. Yes, it's that bad. I finally decided I would get rid of the dog.I felt bad, even though it's not real. I'm glad I deleted my file. Now that annoying dog is not bothering me anymore. Keep yourself from going insane. If you want a pet that badly, buy a fish. It's doesn't do much, but it won't drive you mad."
3,Fun... But Can Be BORING!,"I bought this game as a special pack w/ a nintendo ds.... I thought it was the coolest game in the world.... now I'm into adventure like the new Super Mario,and Ice Age. It gets very boring after bout' the 30th time you've played it! I mean.. the dogs are cute.. but some are hard to train and others are just plain stupid... I never have time to feed my dogs,but I tried to put all of them in the doggy hotel... but you have to keep 1 dogs at home! But to get to the Bright side, This game is really fun when you 1st get it... and doing competions, giving it baths, and taking them for walks.I hope you liked my Review!"
2,nintendogs,I bought this for my daughters birthday. she has been complaining that the game won't let her do anything. The manual said there would be a menu with activities but there wasn't.
3,nintendogs,The game is fun but it gets boring after one week. I do not suggest this game it is endless and it just is boring. You get a dog and do stuff with it. But still the dogs are cool but averthing is to short.
1,GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!,"This game is awsom!!!!! if anybody read this im telling you GET THIS GAME!!! You can walk your dog, wash him, teach him tricks, put them in contests. for that person that said it gets boring forget his he probably didnt know how to go into contests and crape!!"
3,Good dogs,My dogs were very kind to me.These are the good things about the gameNice dogsGood frinedsBad monketys lalalalallalalalalal
3,i dont know...,well i played it and the voice command doesn't work. either it's my ds or game. buy it or not. your choice
5,Fantastic game for young and old!,"I bought this game for my 9 year old daughter for christmas. I love playing it just as much as she does, and we often spent evenings playing together (we have two dogs on it, one she trains with her voice, and I do the other). I would recommend this game to ANYONE."
2,Why buy 3 cartridges when the PSP version will have all the breeds on 1 UMD DISC?,"Hello people, save your money! WAIT FOR THE PSP PORT OF NINTENDOGS. Why buy 3 Nintendogs DS cartridges to get all the breeds when, from what I've read and heard, the PSP version of Nintendogs will have all breeds on one UMD disc?!? (that's the beauty of optical media, all 3 breeds can fit onto one UMD disc rather than having to use 3 SEPERATE cartridges, as is seen in the DS version of Nintendogs).So my advice is wait for the PSP version of Nintendogs. You'll only have to buy one UMD disc rather than 3 seperate cartridges (as is seen in the DS iteration of the game)....thus you'll have spare money to boot."
1,BORED STIFF,FIRST FEW DAYS WAS FUN NOW IM BORED ALL I DO IS WALK THE DOG PET THE DOG WALK THE DOG PET THE DOG WALK THE DOG PET THE DOG WALK THE DOG PET THE DOG YOU GET MY POINT ITS REALLY BORING AND I HAVENT PLAYED IN A WHILE AND I THINK MY DOGS ARE DEAD AND WHEN I TURN IT ON I EXPECT TO SEE A PILE OF BONES WHICH IS SAD CUZ I LOVE DOGGIES GET A REAL DOG THEY ARE MORE FUN THNKS FOR READING IM BOBBY AND IM 7 YEARS OLD AND I DONT LIKE THIS GAME
2,Wait for the PSP port of the game....help the victims of Tsunami Katrina instead!,"Hello, people! Wait for the PSP version of the game (which should be much better). You should use the $35, donate it to the Red Cross to help victims all the victims of Tsunami Katrina in New Orleans. And when the PSP port of Nintendogs comes out, you'll have a great game to boot.Don't forget the victims of the great Tsunami!Which is more important, a video game or the lives of the people affected by the great Tsunami in New Orleans?!?"
1,Speechless,"Who would want to be a video game about controlling a dogs life? For God's sake, where living in a society of humans, not dogs. I mean if u wake up one morning, and u decide u want to be a dog, than u gotta be outta ur mind. Video games are supposed to have action and adventure in them. I don't see any acion or adventure in changing ur dog's water bowl. Training an imaginary dog? What an adventure!! Overall- it's not even one star. There is no number of stars to describe a game so boring and lame."

5,they are so cute,this game is awsome i love it i didnt buy it yetbut i played it in a store anyhoe im getting it for christmas i cant wait!
5,There will never be a nintendogs for PSP,"i know its been said a million times, but look people, NINTENDOgs will never come out on psp! its made by nintendo! you see?well anyway, nintendogs i must say is THE BEST!!!!!!!! My dogs, Bagel, Pugsly, Parsley and Buddy all are too cute! So, as i was saying, you take care of nintendogs like they are real puppies! You walk them, pet them, feed them, play with them, put them in collars, bows and glasses and hats, you also can play on bark mode, which it where you and a friend, who also has the game are aable tohave their dogs play with yours. You can even shop with your dog and enter them in contests!!!the only downside is that you can only have 3 dogs at home, but you can put 5 in the hotel!"
4,STOP READIN AND BUY IT ALREADY!!!,"NAME:ADRIEL RAHMANAGE 12NINTENDOGS IS 1 OF THE BEST DS GAMES YET.THE DOGS HAVE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES.

THIS GAME HAS ONE FLAW THOUGH, YOU MUST FEED YOUR DOGS EVERY DAY OR THEY WILL RUN AWAY.AFTER AWHILE THIS GAME WILL FEEL MORE LIKE A REPONSIBILITY THAN A GAME. OVERALL, IF YOU HAVE A DS BUY IT."
4,very good,"I am severly allergic to dogs, but i really like them, this game is the first game that i have had that lets me feel like i have a dog, tamagotchis were like aliens :S it isnt perfect, the voice recognition isnt amazin but mind you, would a real dog learn his or her name straight away? i am enjoying this game a lot, and probably will for a very long time :D"
5,The Dog Master-Carlos Sirot NY,"This game rocks out loud!! This game was way worth the money! In this game, you get to train,care,brush,feed,water(etc.)your dog! I love this game! If you have a friend with a nintendog game, you and your friend could give each other the dogs you unlocked, give gifts and many more! Overall, I give this game 98 percent! By the way, you can have up to three dogs at your house and 5 at the dog hotel! This game lasts a very long time and I am still playing it. I got this game for my birthday and I am glad I wanted it!!!! This game teaches you responsibility by taking good care for your pup!"
5,A MUST HAVE FOR DOG LOVERS!,"If you love dogs or can't get a dog, get this gamea. The ads were so good i went out and bought a ds and the game. this game is so awesome!Why are you reading this? You should be buying nintendogs!"
4,Good eyeliner but..,"The eyeliner itself is great. I have it in black and it goes on smooth and dark, good for a smokey look. However, it doesn't have as much glitter as expected. This could be good for some people, but when I order a product that claims to a glitter eye pencil, I expected more glitter. If you want a sexy dramatic glitter look that's not too 80s, try Victoria's Secret liquid metallic eye liner. Otherwise, stick with this product."
5,"This is ""IT""","I really rejoiced that I've bought this cd from the very beginning, you know, the groove of two bass drums.Then all went BANG! Vocal was growling lovely, guitars were scattering my brains. Some minor parts in theirfirst album was completely fixed. They made a great success in making compact, heavy confessions on modern cruelties.But, there is one track I still don't understand, it is so a boring track. I guess, they tried to cutoff all the unnecessitiesfrom their songs and built into a single song.Anyway I keep on skipping that track...Anyway, any how, there's no doubt that this album rules, and it's their best album,and one of the masterpiece in the history of thrash/hardcore page."
5,Very original and KICK-A$$,"I first heard Fear Factory in Mortal Kombat the movie. When I heard Raymond Herrera's drums going at about 100 miles a minute, Dino Cazares' guitar wailing, and Christian Olde Wolbers' bass shaking the walls, I was hooked. I finally bought the soundtrack, and heard Burton C. Bell's brutal vocals for the first time. Ever since I heard Zero Signal for the first time, I've never been able to go a day without listening to Fear Factory. They are truly one of the most original bands that I have ever heard. They play with emotion, aggression, and, most of all, passion. I have a couple videos of them live in concert. It is so awesome to see bands get into their music as much as these guys do. They are also one of the few bands I've heard to ""successfully"" use keyboards in their songs. This blend of metal with industrial is the best sound I've heard in heavy metal in a long time. There isn't anything I don't like about these guys. You must get this album!"
5,"The best FF cd, ever....","There is nothing else in all of Fear Factory's discography that can match this one. It is a classic, no questions. ""Replica"" is still the best song that FF has done, and it shows, as being their choice of closing song on the Jagermeister Tour last year. My favorite songs from Demanufacture are Demanufacture, Replica, New Breed, Body Hammer, and Zero Signal. The whole cd is awesome, and will remain in my possesion until I die. If you don't own this cd, and are an industrial/metal fan, buy it. If you don't, you are completely missing out."
5,Tight,"I remember seeing Fear Factory back in 96; one of the best bands then and still of now. Best double bass drummer ever, Dino kicks ass, and who wouldn't kill for a crushing voice like this guys'? Mix in some `80's new-wave synthasizer stuff, and you're set for life. Great band; good as Nirvana, Tool and Radiohead. That's all."
3,Comes down to taste but not bad,"My 2 cents on this band:Machine Head + a bunch of synthizers + goofy monk like chanting. If you think a band like Machine Head gets old super quick (like I do) be warned! Those guys stomp this band into the dirt.Its all taste, a decent set of music but not for everyone.BTW: Track 5 ""New Breed""...is he saying ""Food Fight?"". HAHA, hiliarious."
4,This CD ain't half bad!,"I was actually pretty impressed when I heard this CD. It had a new, more modern feel to it than most traditional metal albums. I love the drum-work on this album, something I usually pay little attention to. And I love the vocal range these guys have from pure ferocity to deep, almost divine-like ""singing"" dare I say? Whatever it is I like it. The only fault I have is the lyrics. Really depressing and really hard to embrace. I could care less how ""numb"" you feel and how you were some poor little victim of society. Get over yourselves and get to some self-help places. If you want some real good, metal-like music with lyrics on the more positive tip, check out some lesser known bands like Earth Crisis, Vision of Disorder, One King Down, Strife, and Culture. These guys all tear it up in a similar vein as Fear Factory, but the lyrics are a lot more thought-provoking and socially conscious. --Kelly Magovern"
5,Amazing,Fear Factory is the future of heavy metal. Herrera's double kick drums are incredible. The one thing that sets this band above and beyond the rest is lead singer Burton C. Bell. His ability to go from errie monk to rabid saint bernard is amazing. Definatly a must have for all metal fans.
5,Fear Factory's Terminator Masterpiece.,"Start to finish, brutal, raw, original, memorable.All of these so called Nu Metal bands owe their existance to this album.Very few band have been sooooo copied and never given credit.With this disc Fear Factory have earned thier place in music history.A must have for any fan of the extreme."
5,Buy or die...,"...just kidding. If you don't own this, however, you are missing out. If you're a fan of thrash metal, death metal, goth/industrial, etc., buying this will make you *very* happy!"
5,Soul Sounds,"How do they do it?! They HAVE to be the only metal band that can play hard music, yet have these achingly melodic interludes which seem to reach a place other ordinary toothbrushes can not! Every song on this album is addictively good and no matter how many times I listen to this cd, I never get sick of it! (This has been going on for 3 years now.) A metal classic."
5,WARNING: THIS CD WILL TATTOO A BARCODE IN YOUR BRAIN!,"This Cd is seriously heavy and by far Fear Factory's best album. I have to say that Burton's vocals are second only to Barney Greenway from Napalm Death. Zero Signal, Pisschrist, Self Bias Resistor, Replica, New Breed all anchor this album. Demanufacture is so well produced that you will not believe that this is their major label debut. This album shames Obsolete, so if your just getting into Fear Factory definitely buy this first and then Soul of a New Machine and proceed very cautiously to Obsolete(hardcore fans only). I hope that this was not Fear Factory's peak but if it was its a damn worthy obituary."
4,cool ship,"I couldn't believe how durable and detailed this ship was for the price. We bought it for our kids who are obsessed with ""How to Train Your Dragon."" The ""Dragon"" figurines are perfectly sized for this ship. Great purchase."
1,Not very satisfied,"Got these as overnight protection for our 5 year old Autistic son. He was having leaks with Pampers Goodnights, so we tried these. Not only did they leak just as bad (if not worse), the filling came out to cover him in clear ""crystals"". The peach mat is not up far enough and /or absorbent enough for a male side sleeper. Very disappointed!"
3,Well thought out and complete,"This is a quality book that cover all the most important German cars of the past 50 years. Good reading for those who are looking for a good general knowledege of the subject,"
3,cover of book,"I ordered a book as a gift, and it was listed as NEW, when it was received, the book was new, but the cover had marks and folds on it, I really do not feel this is a NEW book."
5,Bailey Family Review,We really enjoy playing this game weekly. It is fun for all of us. My 7-1/2 year old and 4-1/2 year old both can play. My 4-1/2 year old can play this independently where she needs help with regular BINGO games. The kids think it's cool because it's on the TV. Mom & Dad think it's GREAT because we don't have the kids fighting over who is going to be the caller because the TV calls it. We highly recomend it for people of all ages. If you don't know your Disney charaters you will after playing this game.
3,More readable than usable,"First, this book is great fun to read because of the real life examples of, you guessed it, how NOT to write a screenplay. And, in between laughing at the stupid mistakes of others, you certainly become aware of the times where you've done the same thing. Granted, Flinn explicitly says he is not out to tell you how to write, but to how to make it presentable to the reader. However, some of the advice is basic. I thought the coverage of the process of how a screenplay is greenlighted to be the most useful part. The examples of how to write action descriptions were also very useful."
3,What type of scale are you people using?,"I'm not sure what type of scale you folks are using that you've given this book a five star rating but it does not convert in my world. I have read a dozen well respected books on the subject. The information in this book often goes against tried and (still) true recommendations and, at times, contradicts itself. It is not useless, but should be read only after a large body of other, legitimate works have been absorbed to salt the read.I hope this rating system can prove itself trustworthy by submitting a less flattering review."
3,:-),Not what I expecetd nothing was in order but the book was some what helpful. I would not recommend it but I think its still worth a buy.
4,"FUNNY, FAST READ","EXTREMELY HELPFUL, A LOT OF USEFUL INFORMATION. THE AUTHOR KEEPS YOU LAUGHING WHILE STAYING ON TASK. RECOMMEND."
3,SO SO Book,"Haven't actually read the whole thing yet. But I did skim through it, and it doesn't look bad. It's actually pretty easy to grasp. By the way, he wrote Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country so if you liked that movie, you'll probably like this book. He wrote this book based on his expereinces as a script reader."
5,Best for more intermediate level screenwriters,"I found the book extremely helpful - but I would NOT recommend for beginning screenwriters.I've written almost 3 screenplays, and had them critiqued in class. So, I would say that I am an beginner-intermediate level. This book is an excellent resource for those who are already familiar with good screenwriting rules and formats, and need to refine these points.I saw many of my own mistakes in the book examples (yikes!) - you know what they say, the best way to learn is by making a mistake.Therefore, if you have yet to write at least one screenplays, I'm not sure this book will be as helpful as books like ""Hot Property"" or ""The Screenwriter's Bible."""
4,A good read!,"This guy is funny. I burned through this book in short order. A little heavy on the inclusion of other writers work, but it does illustrate his points. That is the only reason I didn't give it five stars.He claims that the screenplays he faults are actual screenplays. It's not hard to imagine somebody who bought this book recognized their work. Not good."
3,Chances are you won't make many of these 101 mistakes,"After writing my first screenplay I bought several books to help me tighten things up and make sure I had a good structure. This book will help you make a presentable screenplay and avoid a few common formatting and descriptive mistakes.Even as a first time screenwriter having read no books I had avoided almost every mistake mentioned. I only learned 3 or 4 things I didn't already think about. It's good as a reference and might help you catch a couple things you didn't think of. If you know nothing of screenwriting and need the basics this will be helpful. If you know the basics there are better books you could choose that will help more with structure and story.I liked the book, it had a fun format. It just wasn't as useful as I'd have liked it to have been."
3,A good book that's useless as a reference tool,"This book is full of many examples of bad screenwriting, and does a good job of pointing out these examples' various problems, and how these problems can be fixed. I think it would be an enjoyable (although often overly cynical) read for anyone writing a screenplay. For the most part, I recommend it.However, once you've finished reading this, as a reference book this book is USELESS. It doesn't have an index. It doesn't have an index...and even its table of contents isn't that helpful. If you want to look something up, you'd better remember what page it was on, or you'd better hope you marked it well, because you're going to have quite an interesting time trying to find what you're looking for."
3,"Okay, Okay","This is a book that could have been a long article, or two. But those article would have been interesting. I found the book getting very repetitive in the last half, when we started getting the same material over and over again. But the notions is good: that you need short scenes, with a whammy."
5,What they said,Don't want to reiterate all the positive things said already just want to back them up because I bought this book based on the comments posted here and I'm glad I did. This one of the best books I've read on screenwriting. It's to the point and tells you what you need to know. Though it is more helpful if you have already finished a screenplay.
5,An absolute must read for aspiring screenwriters.,"This book is a MUST READ for those of you out there that want to write a screenplay. It is not a book on how to write a good movie, it's a book on how not to write a bad movie (big difference). There is not a single page about outlining or prewriting of any kind. There is no preaching about how any story with X plotline won't work so you should make a new story. He doesn't not talk about good or bad plots, JUST GOOD OR BAD SCRIPTS.This book motivates one to write efficiently. It successfully helped me weed out overwriting from my work. If you've read other screenwriting books before this is still a must read. He talks little about the art of screenwriting and relies almost exclusively on the science of it. It made me aware of flaws in my writing no proofreader or editor could spot and that is completely invaluable. Best eleven bucks and change I ever spent."
4,A Good Read,"I read and enjoyed ""Ben Hogan's Secret."" I too read the first chapter on the website and decided to purchase the book. I enjoyed reading about the camaraderie between Hogan and Bobby Jones. It was interesting how Jones helped Hogan believe in himself as a golfer. I recommend adding this book to any golfer's library."
2,A Double Bogie,"The first reviewer gets it right. This book is a double bogie, lacking both depth and scope. I became frustrated and irritated with its oversimplication of Hogan and his character. If you want an excellent read concerning Ben Hogan pickup Curt Sampson's 'Hogan."" Its an ace!"
1,Laughable!,"I can't believe the good reviews this book has gotten here on Amazon. In my opinion, this book is so far fetched it's laughable. It vaguely hits upon factual events in Hogan's life and it is written as if by (and for) an elementary school child. I know it is a fictionalized story, but it's based on a real person and therefore must remain somewhat grounded in reality. Unfortunately, it does not. This book is incredibly trite and simplistic and makes Ben Hogan appear as an insecure, confused little boy..."
5,"Surprisingly accomplished, and pleasant listening","This very early look at Joe Zawinul's career is a solid, swinging, engaging, pleasant acoustic jazz album. Zawinul was a mainstream jazz pianist in Austria playing with an Austrian group at this time. His playing is swinging and together. The other musicians also swing and play quite well, in a mainstream jazz style. None of the musicians, Zawinul included, have an overwhelmingly unique personal voice akin to an American jazz giant of that era, but this is quite a pleasant 1950s jazz album."
5,Love it!!,"This smells so yummy!! It is like a day at the beach. I wish the scent would linger a little bit longer, I go thru it quickly. But it is my favorite!"
4,Life Of Agony,"The Second Album from LOA is a little softer, but it seems to have the same feeling as the fist. I think that LOA was one of the best band out there ever. Buy this album, you won't regret it."
2,What a disappointment,"After listening to and loving River Runs Red, I went out and bought their next album, Ugly. Turns out Ugly is lame in comparison. Did Cher become the new lead singer or something? Just listen to How it Would Be, and try to tell me that's not Cher. Not that I have anything against Cher, but she just doesn't fit in the metal scene."
4,Your life is never as doomed as this album.,"Gloom and doom rule the roost! Just when you think you can't take it anymore, LOA throws in a boppier song which is the equivalent of musical Prozac. This reminds me a lot of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage from Black Sabbath, everything from the wailing, hopelessness in the vocals right down to the plodding bass. I put this group in the same category as Type O Negative, Kyuss, Trouble and Cathedral. Never play these artists back-to-back though, it's too much bleakness for one day... if you can endure all these within 24 hours, get help! I was baffled by the ridiculous inclusion of ""Don't You (Forget About Me"") at the end."
3,"Very good, but not the best","As with many compliations, sometimes you just miss the mark.The first two albums in this series were wonderful and eclectic. A great mix of country, blues and jazz.And while Sounds of Wood & Steel 3 follows this same pattern, the choices left me (on a few tracks) flat.Over all, it's a very good album, but I do find myself looking to fastforward past two or three tracks.This is a wonderful introduction into several different artists and for that reason alone, makes the album worthy of keeping.My suggestion: listen to the samples prior to purchasing."
3,Not as good as #1 & #2,"Good Instrumental and quality sound recording, but content not as overall pleasing as VOLs 1 & 2."
2,not the same scent as original one,"Yes, i got the product on time. But, I have my doubts on whether this was the original perfume. Perhaps it is but has been sitting in the store for a long time...It just smelled a bit different from the original (hard to find in America...)"
2,Did Eden changed formulation/ingredients???,"This is (or better saying was) my most favorite scent of all...since my early 20s...then suddenly this last bottle caused me terrible allergies...horrible headaches. Tested agai and again after some days without use it and there it was, terrible headaches due to allergies...which never ever happened before.There is something different in the perfum, some ingredient that kinda ""irritates"" the nose.I contacted cacharel to find out that the product is not produced in US anymore, just somewhere in Europe...and therefore US Cacharel could not give me any info on how or if the ingredients were changed...So unfortunatelly will not be purchasing Eden anymore...after being my most favorite perfum for almost 20 years!"
2,Eau de Eden vs. Eden (very different!),"I have used ""Eau de Eden"" by Cacharel for over 15 years. It smells like a fresh spring/summer day and made me feel happy! Because I can no longer find ""Eau de Eden"" I decided to try ""Eden"". I thought, same manufacture, similar names could not be too different, right? I couldn't be more disappointed. ""Eden"" (I am very sorry for those how like it) for me smells like old lady, old things, makes me feel depressed and gives me a headache."
1,How very disappointing!,I was so looking forward to receiving my all time favorite fragrance and this is NOT the same formula. I want to cry as they somehow changed the notes and it doesn't have the same smell; for me it is actually a little nauseating but then perhaps it is only that I want to be sick because of my disappointment. I will be looking for a new fragrance and am so ticked at Cacharel for switching things up. It smells kind of cheap.
2,A simple way to know WW II,"This book is one of the finest simple book about WW II. Everything is neatly packed and introduced. The author divides this book into several chapter, indeed, a very smart division that makes easier to read and understand. This book is definitely for the beginners, as an introduction for they who do not know about WW II. For readers who claim themselves as WW II experts or intermediates, buying this book means wasting money for the they must have known all the information in it. That this book is lack of details is acceptable, for we can not envelope the whole war in 300 pages, can we ?"

4,Over all a good movie.,Over all this is a good movie. I think 90% of the people who see this movie will like it.
4,Better than you expect,"It is undeniably true that most of the Indie Gay films are pretty bad: Lousy scripts, acting, photography, etc., not to mention the cliches that pop up everywhere. This film, by contrast, was quite refreshing. The script is witty and entertaining, the acting quite good, the photography excellent, and the music soundtrack fine. I think most viewers could see the tragic climax coming, but it ended happily and I cried. Of course, the beautiful boy was absolutely enchanting, and his acting excellent. I was transfixed."
4,"Terrific, if predictable","Good gay guy goes bad, then is redeemed by rich guy. Terrific, if predictable, execution of a well-worn cliche. I'd watch it again."
3,Typical gay movie,"I liked Ludwinski well enough, but the movie is quite the typical gay movie. Naive and maybe not so bright main character that has an overly dramatic, campy, and frequently annoying female relative/friend. Quite the stereotypes found in so many gay movies. A bit disappointed."
2,Hot main character but that's all,"So the main character is extremely adorable. But once you get beyond enjoying what you're looking at, the story is miserable, the acting is beyond repair, and the flow of the movie is awkward."
1,Like really?!,"I am disapointed with this whole movie.I have to say that I didnt see so much cliché in 100 min. Its chliché over and over again.Actor fell in love with porn star? :-) OK. Its because this porn star has pure heart? :-)Of course it is in L.A.? :-)But the very first guy he met is addicted? :-) Which is obvious after 4 min.His (actor) hero refuses for the first time, but then he goes out, proudly!And the main character (porn star)? He is sooo gay!I am sorry but I have no words, I dont know what to say. Maybe so pathetic!!!!"
1,TRÈS ORDINAIRE,LA QUALITÉ BLUE RAY INCONTESTABLE NE FAIT PAS OUBLIER LE MANQUE TOTAL DE FOND.COMME QUOI LE FOND L'EMPORTE TOUJOURS SUR LA FORME
1,tedious tedious tedious,"The title says it all, this movie was horribly tedious. I didn't even have any good sex scene to make up for the tedium..."
2,Predictable,"A bad and predictable script make this a below average movie. Was glad when it ended. Pity though, because it had potential to be much better."
3,Candy carried the movie,"If you like Jennifer Coolidge from the American Pie movies, Best in Show, you will really enjoy Allison Lane (Candy)from this movie. Unfortunately, she could only carry the show so far. She has great comedic timing, yet the main male characters are still learning their craft. I would love to see her in a feature film, she has what it takes to make - comedy to drama effortlessly.The movie was overall good - liked the chemistry between Adam and the closted-comedy actor - would see it again."
5,What a wonderful movie!,"Going down in La-La Land is a wonderful movie. You will be fascinated from the first minute until the end. This movie contains everything to become one of my favorite films. Love; Hate; Hope and finally a happy end. (Or maybe not, you really have to watch this movie to find it out.)"
5,interesting,THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT A MAN TRYING TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND ALSO NEED LOVE. HE HAS A BEST FRIEND THAT ENCOURAGE HIM IN A GOOD AND BAD WAYS BUT HE ALWAYS PICK THE GOOD WAY SO I THINK. THAT LANDED HIM TO THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE. THIS MOVING IS INTERESTING I WILL GIVE IT 5 STARS
4,Going Down Is Up There With - Shelter and Latter Days,Good GLBT DVD to own. This will add to my GLBT DVD at home collection and make it four. Top is Brokeback but this is right up there with movies like - Shelter and Latter Days. A movie worth watching over and over. Lead actors were great and a believable story line. Wow...which is hard to find in a lot of GLBT movies. Just enough skin to make one want to hit rewind a few times. Worth the $$. I watched it for the third time last weekend.Thanks Casper for making and staring in a great movie. Matthew Luwinski is a HOTTIE and an enjoyable actor to watch. Allison Lane is funny and sad in a LA sort of way. Loved her strut at the end.
3,It was okay...,The movie had some moments that were eye-roll worthy. I get the director's penchance for being in his own movies but even I couldn't believe that anyone would trust any word or promise that came out of his mouth.
3,OK movie,"This was not what I had in mind. The acting was OK. They spent way too much time with the 'bread' and not with the 'meat'. In other words, the Love story should've the meat instead everything else around that was given more focus. I felt that the Love story didn't come into play until the last minute. I dunno, I wouldn't watch it again. Cool to watch it once though."
3,SOAP,"Good film, but a bit of a soap opera and some of the acting is a little hard to take.Beautiful man (Matthew Ludwinski) comes to Hollywood and ends up in West Hollywood and like all good fairy stories. The prince goes through trials and wins his prince, somewhat, prince charming.It's not bad film, it's just, in my humble opinion, not Casper Andreas best, but it still can make you laugh. Jesse Archer is great as an up-tight phone Nazi; you do feel for Adam (Mathew).It you like soaps and a bit of cheese, you will like this, maybe watch this before you buy and remember to do it legally, so we can support great gay film makers like Casper Andreas"
4,Great movie,It looked like a great movie. I sadly was unable to finish it. As soon as I have time I would like to rent it again and finish it. But from what I did see It was funny and the best friend was a hoot.
4,So LA,"It was cute! Matthew Ludwinski makes for Great Eye Candy and Allison Lane cracks me up. It was no cinematic ""masterpiece"", but I thought it was Entertaining nonetheless..."
5,This one is a winner!,"Director Casper Andreas has a winner here. He is also in the cast and does an excellent job. Great story and all cast members do a very good job. Rising star and hunk Mathew Ludwinski is outstanding as an aspiring actor trying to navigate the gay world of LA. He is hot, sexy and has a charm that the director makes good use of. Highly recommended."
4,Going Down in LA LA LAND is a real fun treat,"I really enjoyed Going Down In La La Land, the script was spot on,, the direction was excellent, Casper's best movie yet, LOved Matthew Ludwinski, not only is he beautiful but his acting was equally as beautiful and his best friend was was very funny, all the exrtas were great so its well worth the purchase price,, im really happy i invested a tiny ammount in thsi lovely fun and moving movie,,"
5,Royal Albert Old Country Roses 4 Pc. Hostess Set,The Royal Albert Old Coury Roses 4 Pc Hostess set is very pretty and adds a classy touch to my beautiful Gravy boat and serving dishes. Great deal -so glad I bought this set.
1,Received a Different Stamp and Brand,"I ordered this stamp and received a CHEAP generic line dater stamp, NOT the product listed. On top of that it is not even the same brand. I am in the process of requesting a return, but this is definitely a waste of time and money to have to be returning a STAMP that was under 10 dollars."
5,You will love it,"If you like the Trailer Park Boys show you will love the movie. Great storyline and characters, just like you would expect. Pushes all the boundaries."
5,Super funny,If you like TPB this Christmas special is hilarious. It shows you how things got the way they are and why in Sunnyvale.
4,What I expected,I expected this to be funny and I wasn't let down. If you're a fan of the TPB series than this is a must have.
2,Nothing Earth Shaking,You have to love TPB to like this special. No new ground is broken and the tried and true jokes now seem stale. Buy this to complete a collection only unless you just have a need to be moderately entertained for less than ab hour.
2,Very targeted humor,"Fans of the show Trailer Park Boys will not be disappointed with this movie. Marginal fans of the TPB will be. I turned it off after 20 minutes. My husband, however, a massive fan of TPB, watched the whole movie and declared it ""dumb"". While I totally get the charm of the moronic, self-serving humor of TPB, this went above and beyond the call of idiocy. The party scenes in the jail were the best part - what does that tell you?? Don't waste your brain cells or your money unless you are a HUGE fan."
5,"Great Watch, great price, very accurate","I'm new on the automatic watches department, so the only thing i can say is that it is huge, heavy, nice looking, quality build, accurate (mine gains only 3 seconds per day), it is a good one for dudes, i will get the yellow and the black one in the next month,MM, what else... did i say great watch?..."
4,"If you love sporty, showy watches, you'll love this","The Invicta Grand Diver 3045 is a very large, solid watch. I think they made them specifically for football players and Navy Seals. You'll see what I mean if you take a look at the picture I've attached of my husband wearing it - he's 6'3"" and 185 pounds. He put it on and mentioned the need to start weight lifting.The silvery blue of the watch face is brilliant and very eye-catching. This is definitely a sporty watch, and you wouldn't wear it with any kind of business or formal clothing. I look at this watch and the feel is one of wearing it out on a boat with blue waters and bright sunlight and...the person wearing it is Alex O'Loughlin of Hawaii Five-O. The funny thing is that Daniel Dae Kim wears one that is more in line with this watch. See pics on imdb from Hawaii Five-O.The luminous phosphorescent glow on this watch is wonderful. It does run a few seconds fast in a day.All in all, a beefy watch!"
5,This is a solid watch,"I'm very pleased with this watch. Looks great, nice and heavy, fairly smooth automatic movement and feels good to wear. I have received several compliments already and my buying experience was good. Have only had it a few weeks, but so far no problems mechanically. I would definitely buy another Invicta, in fact already have my eye on a few. This is a bigger watch but not too big, good proportions. I feel this watch has great value for the money. A lot of the high end dive watches are just too small for my taste. Thumbs up."
4,"Good, but not the sum of its parts","Great underrated diver's watch, and it comes with the latest & greatest automatic movement... the NH35A.... which allows hacking and manual winding -- making it everything you'd want in an automatic movement. Construction and quality are excellent.One downside is that even though I have large wrists (8"" circumference) this watch felt cumbersome to wear. I think it was the thickness & weight more than the actual watch face size. I have a Seiko ""Frankenmonster"" that is about the same size, but feels much less bulky on my wrist."
3,Submariner???????,"for some reason, the sign in page is not allowing me to enter a rating...I give it 5 stars....great looking watch and runs beautifully,....like all automatic movements it tends to run a little fast, but no crisis....Invicta has mastered the art of producing very cool looking watches at affordable price.....they've been rightly criticized in the past for their poor customer service..hopefully they are working on this.....The Amazon price of $199 is okay, but trust me, you can do betterSuffice it to say there's no need to shell out 5 grand for a Rolex Submariner with this baby!"
4,first order...wrong second time...right,"first order for this watch was not as represented. info stated new ah35 movement, i got last years model with older myota works. also, did not appear to be a fresh, new watch. possibly returned for the same reason. re-ordered and was sent the right model...all's well that ends well. dw"
2,Beautiful but not well made,"When this watch arrived I was very excited. It is big, heavy and seemed very well constructed. I was not put off by the Myota movement, but within the first week I lost several minutes. Next, the face was scratched and apparently it is not mineral so it is not scratch resistant. I would have expected more for the price I paid. I still wear it but I feel it is basically ruined because of the scratch. Would not recommend."
2,A Mild Disappointment,"I have found Grimassi to bo one of the more aggravating Pagan authors out there. He does have some interesting ideas and theories, but the rather questionable scholarship he uses to support those ideas subtracts from the book. The dogmatic tone (which sometimes borders on self-righteous) running throughout his narrative is grating in the extreme. I wish the book would have concentrated on exploring the inner workings of the Wiccan mythos instead of desparately trying to prove the antiquity of these teachings."
3,Average,"On a theoretical level, this book is good. A great read for people interested in the mythology and history of pagan religions. However, it's a bit preachy and seems to ignore the fact that everything, including religions and philosophies, evolve. Also an aggravating read, as it's very repetitious and wordy. This book is highly recommended for people who enjoy reading paragraphs 3 or 4 times to grasp their meaning."
3,I was expecting more!,"This book had some good info. But, not nearly enough. What *I* consider to be the Wiccan Mysteries is the Science and Theories of WHY magick works! So, for a good book about THAT buy Laurie Cabot's ""Power Of The Witch"". I was just let down."
3,Decent,"This book supplies basic information on Wicca to the beginner, but the way Grimassi went about giving it wasn't so great. The whole ""exposing ground-breaking mysteries of an ancient cult to the public"" theme was a ploy. I have read this book and I can honestly say that it hasn't given me the ""exclusive inner secrets of Wiccan spirituality"" that it boasts. It does give a good deal of valid information, but it nothing that's so incredibly new and that I couldn't find elsewhere.And I don't like the whole New Age thing that Grimassi throws at you. He has a condescending style of writing, but Wicca is supposed to be non-dogmatic. And--as an earlier review pointed out--he doesn't seem to get that religions can evolve."
5,Edifying,This book filled in many gaps that much other Pagan literature leaves. The historical tie-ins were very refreshing.
3,Yawn...,"For all that Grimassi wants us to believe he's imparting ancient teachings that have never been revealed to the public before, there wasn't a thing in this book I hadn't already read somewhere else. Add to that his dubious historical account of Wicca, based almost entirely on Marija Gimbutas whose research has been laughed at by the academic community, and you get more of the usual 101 revisionist can't-tell-the-difference-between-empiric-history and-mythic-history mishmash. Plus at least five sentences on every page start with ""The ancient teachings say..."" As if he's worried that if we don't believe Wicca is older than dirt, we won't believe anything he says. Quite off-putting and rather pretentious."
3,Good stuff...bad smell,"I gave this gift to my cousin who was going away to college. I sent it directly to her house gift wrapped. When she opened the box, my aunt told me that it smelled like motor oil. Everything in the box had a little bit of grease on it. We haven't figured out where it came from except that there is a multi-head screwdriver in the box that was a little greasy. Good stuff inside...however...something stinks!"
2,Decent,"I bought Chaos A.D. and loved it. Loved the whole album and every song in it. Thats what I think makes a great CD is the quality of each songs regardless of lyrics. After listening through the album over about four times it isn't too bad. Some songs really stand out while others don't. Dictatorshit does not fit in this CD, even though its awesome. Its more thrash style. I would recommend buying this if you want a different experience with listening to Sepultura."
2,"Hardcore ""Nu - Metal""","This ok for Nu - Metal I guess (not really), but Sepultura was once a GREAT band. I would not spend your money on this album though you should buy their albums before this one insted. Max and the band turned their backs on their real fans with this album :("
3,AT LEAST,"At least the Brazilian band tried to make something different, and their efforts were recompensated by the huge success of the album. (although I don't give a damn about tribal sounds! )). They deserve their success. Very intelligent album."
3,Great album between era's.,"This was the last album to date for Sepultura w. Max in their origional form. This album was the turning point for Sepultura and the albums after and prior to this one are much better than this one, but this one is also really good. This album features some classic songs that Sepultura & Soul Fly still play regularly but also alot of songs that are just to experimental for me, hence my mixed review. It's a great album for any Sepultura fan, but as I said I enjoyed the previous early albums and the albums following this one alot more."
2,2.5 Stars,"This is a pretty dissapointing release by Sepultura. Since I like to buy my records in chronological order, I was expecting something like ""Arise"", ""Chaos A.D."", or ""Beneath The Remains."" This album is way to Nu-Metal influenced, and is pretty repetitive. There are some good tracks, such as Attitude, but there are many weak tracks that are either, too repetitive, boring, or just plain [bad]. If you want a good Sepultura album, get one of these: Morbid Visions/Bestial Devestation, Schizophrenia, Beneath The Remains, Arise, or Chaos A.D. I'm not saying you shouldn't get ""Roots"", you might like it, there are some good songs. I'll still occasionally pop this in my cd player for a listen."
4,Sepultura rocks!,"Sepultura belongs to the top-class in heavy metal. Eventhough it may not sound like it to some, sepultura's members are very professional.Three words to describe Roots from Sepultura: Energy, percussion, anger.Their music is filled with energy, the percussion is world-class, and they display a lot of anger in their lyrics."
5,Sepultura's Masterpiece,"This is the creme-de-la-creme of Sepultura. Sure it's a lot different than Choas A.D. or Arise, but it really works. It starts out by smashing ya upside yo head with ""Roots Bloody Roots"" and doesn't stop till your ears bleed. My only beef about the Cd would be the tribal interruption of the otherwise orgasmic ""Ambush."" When I hear that song, I get goosebumps. The jam just breaks it up. Highlights include ""Roots Bloody Roots,"" ""Cut Throat"" ""Straighthate"" ""Dusted"" ""Ambush"" and ""Endangered Species."" You definitly need to pick this CD up, it is spectacular."
5,Excellent,"This cd is by far one of the best cd's I have ever heard. Its heavy, powerful, and just plain brutal. The best tracks were hard to pick because it is all so good, but Roots Bloody Roots, Straighthate, and Attitude were my favorites. My only problem with this is that they were trying to sound like Korn a little bit, and thats dissapointing because they already had their own unique sound with Chaos A.D.(my favorite of theirs) and they just didnt follow in that direction. But, other than that, this is an excellent cd, and you will not be dissapointed by it."
3,A MEDIOCRE ALBUM.,"This album is nowhere near the level of the classic chaos ad.The songs sound okay but are simply not memorable.They are experimenting too much with having a tribal sound and this takes away from their thrash roots.Roots has more of a numetal sound to it and they are simply not a thrash band anymore.Max cavaleras voice sounds like he is simply screaming and is at its worst here.Some people may like this album,but I dont feel its worthy of my cd collection.Thats it for now.Peace."
3,Convert,"I used to be a big Nu-Metal fan. I used to listen to the stuff that was on the radio and the bands that actually played concerts in my area. At the time, I thought this album was awesome. However, I have since moved onward and now realize that this CD really isn't as good as I had originally thought. Having said this, I do like Roots Bloody Roots a whole lot, and I'm still a fan of the tribal songs like Istari, but that's about it. I now find the rest of the CD to be somewhat repetetive. Now, having said that I only really like two songs from the whole CD, you might be wondering why I gave it three stars. Roots was the CD that introduced me to older (and superior) Sepultura. My suggestion is that if you are a fan of thrash, don't bother with this one. If you are a Nu-Metal fan like I was, then pick this one up. Not only will you probably like it, but it is also ideal for introducing you to Sepultura's greater works."
2,THANK GOD THIS WAS MAX'S LAST ALBUM.,"WAY TO SLOW. MAX TOOK THEM IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THEY SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE PURE THRASH. MAX IS AN AWESOME SONG WRITER, BUT HE CHANGED IT UP TO MUCH ON THIS ALBUM. BUY BENEATH THE REMAINS AND ARISE."
1,Not indicative of their early sound,"If you think this album is good or you like nu-metal then go to paragraph two of my review.This is a warning for thrash metal listeners that may get turned off by this and disregard some earlier and much superior efforts from hearing this. The album ""Beneath the Remains"" has a good aggressive thrash sound to it, if you are going to dislike the band you might as well hear their best album first.Now to take care of the people that like this album. I implore you to track your way backward through their albums instead of listening to this and graduating to Soulfly to follow Max. The previous album ""Chaos A.D."" should be enjoyable if you liked this, and may serve as an even better transition to their early thrash metal albums."
1,Not impressed.,"Sepultura was recommended to me by a friend and I was very disappointed. The lead singer doesn't sing well at all, the music was chaotic and devoid of any hooks. File this one under ""ugh."" If you want something loud that sounds good, go with Rammstein."
1,Stop ripping off of Slipknot!,"If it weren't for Slipknot, there would be no room for bands like Slayer, Sepultura and Pantera. I think it is ridiculous that Sepultura are always trying to cop Slipknot's sound. Max cannot scream like Corey does. I hate people!"
5,Deviant Behavior,"This album is a departure from their earlier albums in that it is not as much straightforward, angst-fueled, teeth grinding metal. However, this departure is a positive result of the band expanding their sound to add not only a taste of their native Brazilian sounds, but also the variety of other metal artists outside of the band. In the direction of the latter, I believe ""Lookaway"" to be one of the albums highlights. The band ingeniously combine the mumbling,anger ridden raps, rants and whispers of Korn's Jonathan Davis, the spiritual, distant staccato of Faith No More's Mike Patton, and their own crunching metal to create a truly unique vibe that, like the album itself, expanded the overall sound of Sepultura without sacrificing their own traditional style-the straightforward, grinding metal of their previous albums that has become their trademark."
2,This ain't thrash metal,"Ok..this is not at all Thrash Metal , Sepultura totally sold out , this is just plain,horrible,...,simple , boring ,repetitive..Nu Metal(if you have any more words to describe it just let me know).I mean , this may be a good album , but not up to the standards of the Sepultura . All the songs are almost the same , the voice totally changed and you can bearly tell what the guitars are playing . So my advice , if you like Thrash metal dont buy this... , this is NU METAL,this is for guys who like korn,limp bizkit and all that Popish music for 15 year old kids . God am i angry man.See ya"
3,Roots,"Roots being the 6th studio of Sepultura and their 1996 release does not sound like alternative metal, groove metal, or death metal. It sounds more like alternative rock with metal glimpses here and there. Compared to earlier releases like Arise and Chaos A.D. the speed has been considerably slowed down and the texts refering to Brazilian politics and culture is hard to understand for someone that gets very little news from that part of the world. Rolling Stone gave the album 3/5 whilst Allmusic gave it 4/5 in their respective reviews. I am not saying that it a bad release by any means but compared to prior releases it is not as strong. 3/5."
2,possessed by their savage ancesters,"i guess they did what they thought was best. stripping down the killing machine that had brought them to artistic & probably financial freedom .paying homage to their brazilian heritage & in a way ,i guess ,thanking their people.i think they brought in a bunch of locals and stuff which is cool & i'm sure it was fun recording it.but it gives it too friendly of a sound for my taste."
2,does not insulate well,hot liquids stayed hotter longer in my uncovered Coleman double walled stainless steel mug than in this Copco carafe. I am repurposing this as a toy silver teapot for children's tea parties.
4,Review of The Dead Season,"I thought this was a very interesting book. As far as Casefiles go, it was ok. It was however a little different then some of the other casefiles. Surprise ending, and theme of the 20's. Very good."
4,From the Heart by Hilario Duran,"Hilario Duran has been producing high quality music for some time, but we in the States haven't heard much of it. I was introduced to Duran by playing a few ""From the Heart"" arrangements in a big band, and after that I couldn't wait to get my hands on the CD. There exists a lot of bad coupling of jazz and latin music that just barely captures surface features of each, but Duran has no truck with such shallowness. His music is harmonically rich, original, and full of the fire that characterizes great latin sounds and assertive jazz. You can come out of either camp and fall in love with this stuff. Get it!"
2,Much Ado Over One Woman's Family Connections.,"This book begins with a touched-up photo on the cover, meant to superimpose the characters upon each other. How much of the assumptions about how Dorothy Putnam felt or how she really reacted in her status as a publisher's wife can a reader believe? Surely, there is a story in Amelia Earhart's life for all time, but this book seems to be a sort of self-promotion for the author's distant family connections -- the (yet-unborn) great granddaughter of the (already deceased) Amelia Earhart. If the book were written based on Dorothy Putnam's own version of the story or Amelia's version, it might be more believable. Still, it is always interesting material to delve into anyone's personal diary -- famous or not...."
3,A history lesson on the Putnams and Amelia Earhart,"This is the story of the Putnam family and Amelia Earhart. George Putnam eventually married Amelia, but prior to that was her publicity director and writer of her adventures. Also interesting to learn is the Putnam family was huge in the publishing industry back then but also have a part in the invention of Crayola crayons. Much of the book is Dorothy's diary, which makes it kindof a slow read."
2,Disappointing,The rooibos is fine but the Early Grey flavoring is far too sweet and heavy handed. Tastes more like a perfumed tea than a balanced blend emulating the classic black tea version. I've had very fine rooibos versions of Early Grey so I know it can be done.
4,Sweet Golden Syrup,"This has the consistency of honey and tastes like a toffee. It's surprisingly quite strong. It's good on baked goods, but not good for everything (like drinks, I suppose). You would like this, if you're looking for something new and sweet to put on your pancakes."
1,Damaged can,"Received can with large dent. The box was in good shape, so can was damaged before shipment. The main reason I ordered this product was for the decorative can.The same was true of a can of Black Treacle ordered from the same supplier at the same time and delivered in the same box."
4,I love the music,I love the music and wish they would continue to sing softly to help keep me with the music. I love to sing worship songs.
4,cd,I like the cd .Me and my boys sing all these songs to bad we dont sound very good for the price it is all good would consider ordering more of these types of karokee cds.
5,Great songs,I'm taking this to a girls home in Haiti to help them learn English. They have so much talent and Love God.
5,Good clean fun,"Perfect for my 8 year old daughter's Karaoking. Nothing questionable here, unlike many that I found in local stores. It amazed me what was passing as ""kid friendly"" before I found this."
5,Satisfied,The CD was exactly what I ordered and shipped quickly. Great music quality. I am very satisfied with my order and will be ordering more products like this one in the future. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes to karaoke.
1,Not so sure these are a good idea,"Since purchasing these ""bird protectors"", I have found some literature that says that they are toxic. Birds are fragile and have tiny lungs - I can't justify taking any chances with these. If my bird had mites, maybe."
5,This is the most helpful book I have read!!,"If anyone is faced with a problem of shyness, I recommend this book highly!! I couldn't put it down, and it has helped dramatically with my fear of blushing and public speaking. OUTSTANDING!!!!"
3,"good info what shyness is, not enough on what to do about it","Most of the books covers what shyness is, why it exists, etc. Only about 25 percent of the book covers what to do about it."
4,After all these years,I can still watch this movie and get a kick out of it. Highly recommend if you have never seen.
2,Spare Me......,"The trailers are better than this movie. Some passable lines, but the movie quickly starts sliding downhill. Cute concept, but sily and unrealistic. Best line in the entire movie: ""You're prettier than me.""Donated DVD to someone who enjoys this type of frivolous attempt at comedy."
1,"Movie, :Knocked Up""","First of all, I did receive the movie in a timely manner and it was in good condition.Secondly, I would like to add that this movie is gutter slop and I would NOT recommend it to anyone and I don't mean anyone, regardless of how low your standards might be..."
2,Barely funny,"I don't get what the big fuss is all about. This is just another 'oops I got a random girl pregnant' cliche of a film. Really, whoever said it was hilarious and different hasn't got a clue really. I think I laughed once, maybe. The vulger tones don't bother me, but cliches do and this is filled with them from top to bottom. The actors all did a fine job, but the script is poor. The film itself, is borderline OK."
3,knocked up or knocked out?,The movie was OK. Mainly the beginning and the end. The middle of the movie sort of droned on.. believe it or not this movie has a good story line that ties up well in end. Buy it used.
5,Saw It Twice,"This Hollywood by Canada fellow, Judd Apatow, seems to be an anomaly in Tinseltown, his films have heart. In the case of Knocked Up, the Three Stooges mentality and immaturity of young men are in juxtaposition with real Pro-Life decisions. I mean, they could have just ripped that baby out of beautiful, up-and-coming TV personality, Katherine Heigl at any Planned Parenthood death camp, but, no, they actually will give birth against all odds. Judd, I think you're wonderful!"
3,funny but not as sweet,"Not as sweet and more raunchy than the other Judd Apatow movie of 2007 (Superbad), Knocked Up manages to touch on the tragic and the romantic without being much of either. But all in a good way. This is what romantic comedies are these days - exclusive Apatow productions with the same crew of actors that we've all known since Freaks and Geeks."
4,"Funny Movie, Just A Bit long.","I tend to find that these ""stupid"" movies are always overrated and not very funny. That is not the case with ""Knocked Up."" Seth Rogen & Katherine Heigl do a fantastic job portraying their characters and the movie is hilarious. I actually find it touching that a movie is written about a guy that wants to take responsibility for his child instead of being a dead beat dad. The writing is funny and movie flows smoothly. The only complaint I have is that the movie is just too long at over 2 hours. Don't miss this movie. You will regret it.4 out of 5 stars."
3,Knocked Up,This is not my favorite movie but might be for you. It's funny but in a weird way. Disappointed but not Amazpm's fault just was a wrong choice on my part.
5,Judd Apatow at his best,"This movie is hilarious and heart felt at the same time. Gives me chills every time i hear We Are Nowhere, And It's Now by Bright Eyes in the climax."
4,Wee Jimmy just crowning away,"I have not seen this film in a while, but I do remember it being pretty good. However, the birth seen may be disrubign for some, with the effects used definately not being funny. One of my friends could not watch that part. My only real complaint was that the film dragged on a bit, but not as much as wedding Crashers or Anchorman did. the transfer is the same as the HD-DVD version, which was pretty good; no Dark Knight though"
2,Waste of time and money,Don't waste your time or money. Every funny moment in this movie was in the trailer. 3 minutes of laughter surrounded by 117 minutes of poor writing.
4,"Not Apatow's best, but worth a look","This one isn't quite as funny as some of Apatow's previous work, like The 40-Year-Old Virgin. There are some missed opportunities and some unbelievable plot situations. However, there are still plenty of laughs to be had, if you don't mind the juvenile crudeness of the men involved, particularly the ones played by Rogen and those playing his roommates.If you're looking for insights and profundity, look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood for more lighthearted fare and general silliness, this is worth a viewing."
2,Just O.K.,I found this movie to be... just O.K. From the previews I thought it was going to be a laugh riot. I did laugh in a lot of parts but I didn't find it to be up to the level of say '40 Year Old Virgin' or 'Wedding Crashers'. I also thought that a lot of the scenes with the lead guy (curly hair fat schlub from 40 Year Old Virgin) and his roomates to be really 'unfunny'. I did like the fact that this movie like Parenthood really had some serious moments that made you think about what the situation of having a baby would really be like.
1,What crap,"Poorly acted, no chemistry between the leads, just a horrible written, unbelievable plot. Don't waste your money; Forgetting Sara Marshall is much much better."
3,"Some gross, some heart...","I enjoyed the movie and had a few 'laugh out loud' moments but I cringe at the constant use of drugs and the laid back attitude of the participants for a lifestyle. The growth of a relationship between Rogan & Heigl however was fun to watch and well done. Heigl is especially talented and has a future. Leslie Mann(who plays Heigl's sister) was a surprise to me and awesome in her roll... her real children are in the movie as well and were a pleasure. I am looking forward,now, to the 'sequel' (This is 40)."
2,What's the big deal here?,"In judging a romantic comedy, you can judge it on 2 things- the romance and the comedy.1. The romance- is just ridiculous. Very desirable E network reporters don't date unemployed slacker potheads who are overweight and immature. They date star atheletes, musicians and wealthy businessmen.2. the comedy- a few chuckles here and there but not a ton of laughs. Simply being crude is not funny- there needs to be some humor attatched to the crudeness.So it scores poorly in both areas. I saw the movie after it was a big hit in theaters and DVD so I was expecting something good. I will say the music is very good but do wish the great soundtrack was put in service of a better film. 2 Stars."
3,Knocked Up,Movie start off slow. This movie is an adult movie only. Wasn't happen about the pot smoking in the movie. That should have been left out.
1,One star too many,"My girlfriend brought this one home with another rental. I was vaguely aware of this movie through TV promo etc. To be fair I can only review the first 20 minutes or so because it was so excruciatingly bad that we just couldn't take anymore. And it's not that I don't like lowbrow sophomoric humor at times. Problem was, I failed to see anything remotely funny here. If I knew anyone like any of the characters in this movie I'd shoot myself. And then I'd shoot them. I know. Old joke.I'm at a loss to understand why anyone would enjoy this film."
1,Horrible,This movie was awful. The characters were mean spirited and just plain disgusting. They treated each other with such nastiness. I have to wonder if the writers know any other words than the F-word. The sister character was the worse. She is just plain nasty and disgusting towards her husband. If you enjoy watching people be demeaning towards others then this is the movie for you.
2,Gross,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it just fell completely flat for me. The acting was good, but I didn't find hardly any of it funny. Maybe it's just ""guy humor"" that I don't understand, or my unexplainable, intense fear of pregnancy and babies, but overall the movie was just disgusting to me."
3,average,"Knocked Up is the kind of comedy that's almost pointless. The characters talk, and yet you don't care about anything they say. They try to be funny, and you never laugh. You try to get some kind of interesting story out of what's taking place, and even though you can do it, you wonder if you wasted your time even bothering. That's what Knocked Up is all about."
4,Enlightened.,"Well, I'm completely sold now on Judd Apatow. The guy has to be one of most important filmmakers of our day. Among his works, or at least the ones he was directly involved in some way, I'd rank Knocked Up just ahead of 40 Year Old Virgin and just behind Superbad--which is one I'm still laughing about after seeing the other night. This film is very entertaining but it also reveals a great deal about our contemporary love relationships. The interaction between the married couple--Alison Scott's sister and her husband--is ingloriously reflective of many of the relationships that I've observed. Their strained and unique bond will hit home with viewers. It's a situation that many of us find ourselves in nowadays. On the upside for future renters or purchasers, Knocked Up will definitely appeal to both men and women, but its real value lies in its refusal to bow down to political correctness when evaluating the state of romance. Bravo! Keep up the great work, Judd."
2,Ugh...,"What a waste. There's not much of a story, the dialogue is vapid, and the humor falls flat most of the time. A few good lines and a really hot blond: that's all KU has to offer. Not the worst movie I've ever seen but pretty stupid, over all.Not recommended."
5,another fruit of lowbrow/hibrow comic renaissance,"this is the latest -- and maybe best -- result of current smart-dumb comic renaissance in the vein of wedding crashers, old school, 40 year old virgin, meet the fockers. dumb comedy for smart people hasn't been this funny since murray-chase-ackroyd-belushi were tearing it up at SNL.as is the current vogue, this movie takes a seemingly stupid/mundane occurrence -- an accidental pregnancy from an unlikely one-night stand -- and turns it into an endless laugh riff on relationships, sex, guys, marriage and dope-smokin, worthless 20-something buddies. ""knocked up"" is just as crude as 40-year-old-virgin but smarter. apatow-ferrell-vaughn-wilson-stiller: keep the laughs coming!"
1,Awful movie,"Horrible, terrible, awful! There are not enough words to describe this movie. I finally had to turn it off about half way through because it was absolute torture to watch the rest. Bad acting and a total lack of chemistry between the characters. All I can say is that I am thankful that I didn't spend the money to see this in the theater. Don't waste your time or your money!"
1,Waste of time!!!!,"Awful,not funny at all,painfully embarrassing,lack of taste,promoting and condoning(sic!)drug use is never a good thing, anyone giving this movie more than 1 star mostlikely is on these ""Magic mushrooms"" as well...I wish there was an option for no stars at all...pass on that one it will save you 20 bucks and 2+ hours of your life,you will miss nothing."
5,lighten up,"i read the negative reviews and despite my cynicism (sp?) i say remember. this is a MOVIE about an idealized situation that film viewers might find entertaining and endearing. like , you know, a happy ending? real life doesn't work like this but who cares. i found the movie funny and oddly touching. stoner goof gets lucky and shows his true mettle to a hot, deep chick, who sees his true worth. pure fantasy but wow. IT'S A GODDAMN MOVIE YOU SAPS.i thought it was great"
4,Knocke Up -- Unrated,This movie is as funny as the reviews I've read! Great comedy with an actual story line. Received ahead of schedule as always! SUPER FAST service! Amazon came through again.
4,"Very funny, worth viewing a couple of times","This movie was very funny. Created and directed by the team that brought us 40 year old virgin, this movie brings a guy who has poor luck with the ladies together with a gal who is above his expectations. Together with a little alcohol and some disinhibition, the two are thrown together on a 9 month journey of unknown territory. If you like nerd humor and stoner jokes, along with very funny situations, this is the movie for you. If you are a fan of 40 year old virgin, again, very funny. Check this out, you will like it, more so than what some critics have said."
5,"That rare thing, a modern Hollywood comedy with a heart.","Much like Judd Apatow's preceding film 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', thistakes a silly high concept Hollywood idea (slacker slob impregnatesupper class hottie, in spite of all odds they have the baby and fall inlove), injects it with sharp humor, highbrow and low, pathos, goodacting, and even some real insight into people and relationships.Seth Rogan is terrific, but so is Catherine Heigel, Paul Rudd, andeveryone in the supporting roles.Not a huge visual upgrade between the Blu-ray and the regularDVD, so if cost is a factor..."
5,Great movie,"The producted was packaged well, was exactly what I wanted, received what I order and it was in great shaped when received...."
3,"I like it, but not one of my favorite young person comedies","This is a good movie, but compared to other funny movies of its time and type, not that great. I did like the concept though, but it didn't do a good job of balancing the seriousness of it with the comedy. I'm not upset I got it, but it won't be watched too often."
1,stunk,"I watched about 15 minutes of it and had to turn it off, it was so bad, and so boring. Maybe just rent it first."
2,"Knocked Up, aka Why Stupid People Should Never Procreate","This movie is an insult to women everywhere! Not that I expected an epic tale of chick lit from the director of The 40 Year Old Virgin, but come on... it's so crude and unintelligent, how can anyone have enough respect for these characters to want to sit through to the end? I sure as hell didn't. Absolutely horrible."
2,Slightly better than superbad ???,"Again, Jonah Hill seems to be the common thread in a recent string of nonsensical movies. I was not sure if this thing was trying to be a sex ed movie or what! Thank God Heigl is easy to look at, but not believable hooking up with the dork squad.As other reviewers have stated; I expected more from the 40 year old virgin director."
4,Don't judge this vid by it's lame cover,"I didn't know what to expect from this film, because the cover was so lame. A chance encounter of a loser with an unusually hot girl leads to a scenario that really brings out the best and worst in each character. I thought it was awesome, funny, though more of a chick-flick oriented toward married/pregnant/parent people...and their single friends. A very real, funny, down to earth film.Jonah Hill is destined to star in a Star Wars prequel about Jabba the Hutt's childhood. Jonah really is the puss-filled infection in this film and Superbad...but he plays such a minor role in this one that it doesn't really matter."
2,Disappointing,"I guess I thought this movie would be really funny. It wasn't. It was actually pretty painful. It was funny in spots, but it was slow to start. I was disappointed."
2,Too serious,"Why does every comedy have to ""teach me a lesson?"" It's really annoying. That's why The 40 Year Old Virgin was great. Sure, it had a few serious moments, but overall it was just a silly comedy. After a promising start, Knocked Up devolves into a preachy mess, which is ridiculous given its completely unbelievable premise. Come on - a hot chick goes home with some tool who gets her pregnant. Either A - she'd get an abortion, or B - even if she had the kid, she certainly wouldn't feel obliged to try and fall in love with the guy and make him the daddy. What is this - 1950? I don't want my comedies to ever get serious - with a plot like this, it makes it even worse. They should have stuck to making fun of the guy with the beard."
3,HD DVD version,"I recently rented the movie through Netflix. In the DVD that I had the movie would freeze at certain points not reproducible though. I had just watched the Cinderella Man in HD DVD with zero problems. I suspect it was the disk.To the movie it self I tought the movie had some funny moments but i didn't think it was all that. I think it largely depends on what you find funny. I saw the 40 year old virgin and found it funnier.The movie is something a la 9 1/2 months but with pot, male airhead humor and with a grey's anatomy star protraying her usual role (hysterical ditsy woman.) If you find these combinations are to your liking then this is the movie for you."
4,Knocked Up: Real Review,"I haven't laughed this hard since Wedding Crashers came out in theaters. This movie has all the great humor that our generation thrives on. The film is put together by the same guys that created The 40 Year Old Virgin. It has tons of the same style of jokes and humor as well, so if you liked The Virgin you'll love getting Knocked Up. Along with the same director it also has a lot of the same actors from The 40 Year Old Virgin. I haven't seen this good of casting in a movie in a long time regardless of the genre. Im talking about the main stars all the way down to the guys with one liners, they all meshed great together.Besides the laughs on top of laughs there is actually a story that you can actually feel. Which is a nice extra bonus for this comedy although the ladies might appreciate it more than the guys.Get all your friends overA"
4,Better than I Thought,Well I was not expecting much but this Movie was well done. Not a real thinker movie but the actors made this movie.Seth Rogan did great job as the loser boyfriend and Kathyrn Heigl just perfect as hsi girlfriend . For a lark that is beyond a mindless nothing movie check out this one.
2,Movie misses out.,"I watched this movie for the first time on DVD. I was apalled by the language - when will writers learn that real people DO NOT talk that way 24/7. None of the movie's contrived situations made sense. It was gratuitous from the opening credits.This is not a story line that is untold. There have been many before it, which were told much better. It's a shame, really, because this concept did seem to be a fresh, modern take on an age-old problem. I was eager to see its variation.And then I watched it. I was ready to stop the DVD and hurl the disk into the nearest landfill after 30 minutes, but stayed through until the end. I had heard the movie was a hit in theaters. I still don't know why. It never misses an opportunity to be vulgar.It is said that the right amount of spice enhances a dish and too much spoils it. This dish is uneatable."
1,Needs a Minus Rating - One Star is There Because Amazon Made Me Do It,"This movie is not funny, not artful. It is a vulgar, disgusting movie about sex and the sex act, not about relationships. What a waste of my life's time watching it. I don't see why any actor would have wanted to play any of the parts. I see no redeeming value to this movie, not even simple entertainment. Frankly, I can't think of any other movie I have seen that has been in the theatres that I feel so strongly negative about. Sure, I don't like some movies as much as others, but this one isn't in that ballpark. It belongs in the sewer. My husband says this is a movie for pigs. If this is what our country's culture embraces, then we surely are seeing the end of a wonderful country."
1,Execrable Moviemaking,"I don't normally review movies unless I really like or dislike them. I can't remember a similar disconnect between the critics' favorable reviews and the utter banality and wretchedness of the movie. Inane humor, disgusting characters, gratuitous F-bombs, preposterous plotting, you name it.The only reason I sat through it (while picking up a book) was because my wife can't begin a movie without finishing it. In the end, she thought it was almost as infantile as I did."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Severely overlong for a romantic comedy (130 minutes? Seriously?) and unconvincingly romantic when it should be honest and caustic, Knocked Up is just a formulaic romantic comedy with more raunch; released back when Judd Apatow could seemingly do no wrong, Knocked Up is more hype than substance."
1,"What next, Eva Longoria and Carrot Top?","Synopsis: An irritating slacker, with no job or money, goes to a club he would never be let into. Once inside, he meets a woman beautiful enough to be an anchor on a Hollywood TV show. This woman, who probably avoids anything stronger than water, gets so drunk that she has sex with this son of Harold Ramis.She gets pregnant, he spews some of the most hurtful, foul things one person can say to another and she responds in kind. Finally, after a series of these unpleasant exchanges, she decides he's kinda cute and, of all her options, he's the guy for her. And of course, there are the usual stereotypes of people, saying things real people never say. Its a side splitter."
1,Unwatchable,"I don't understand how this film gets recommendations. It is not funny, clever, witty, well written, or remotely entertaining. I had read some stellar reviews of this movie and was disappointed not just because it wasn't very good, but because it goes to the level of inane. Good comedies are tough to write, but I know some sixteen year old boys who could have done a better job than the one who must have put this one together."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I couldn't believe how puerile and bad this movie was, I just couldn't make it to the end. Judd Apatow obviously blew his wad when he made ""40 Year Old Virgin"", a moderate movie at best."
3,"Good Movie, Playback Problems","I had trouble playing the hd-dvd side in both the hd-a3 player and the hd-dvd drive for 360. I put it straight from the case to the player after I first opened it (meaning I probably did not scratch it). It skipped a few times during the movie, but the last five minutes were unwatchable (it would either freeze or skip too much). It could be that this is a combo disc and there have been problems with other movies released on this combo format before. I did like the movie, but because of the playback problems, I can only give this 3 stars."
1,BIG WIDE LOAD,"What a crappy rude vulgar in the worst way movie, i liked 40 year old virgin but this thing is plane stupid and over long Seth Rogen what a putz of an actorHow does some one get money to make this junk? No wonder kid's are messed up with this garbage. I am sorry i sat thru this big thumbs down do not let your teen-age kids watch this get them something funny this is not funnyBIG WASTE OF TIME...............!!!!!!!!!"
3,"""Debbie is a freak of nature!!""","A solid funny comedy full of sex, lust, jokes and ""plenty"" of nudity.Ben is your typical ""loser"" who meets Alison in a bar. They hook up at her place, have sex and without a condom, enjoy themselves.She had her job, her looks and other things going for her when she found out that Ben didn't use a condom when she specifically asked him to.Right before the act, Ben takes the almost-on condom off because there was a misinterpretation between the two, aka a broken message. She gets pregnant and emotional once she finds out.The characters are funny and many, attractive. The dialogue wasn't too shabby but they swear a lot. Especially the use of the ""F-word"".But if it's a comedy you're after that's kinda tacky, sex-wise, then by all means. It's funny, it's somewhat realistic (for once) and the characters are half way decent.I actually felt something for them.3.75 stars."
5,I think I love this movie because I have a child.,"I think this movie would scare a non-parent. I love it and think it's so funny!! It may be a good birth control method, LOL."
4,Enjoyable,"I agree with the previous review, a cute movie worth watching. Some times it seems to drag out a little, parts of the middle could have been left out and not lost much of anything. But a fun way to spend an evening killing time."
2,Very slow,Long gaps between funny parts. There are a few funny parts but most are at the end. Overall i would not have paid to see it.
4,Funny,This movie is funny. If you are alive and like to laugh watch this movie. I bought it as a gift for my wife.
5,Very funny I laughed the whole time!,"I loved this movie, I laughed constantly. Great acting. Great visuals. Definitely not for kids! I have watched several times. Good for men and women."
1,Is this crap what all the hype was about???,"I'll be honest, I haven't watched this movie. But I swear I tried. I managed about 30 minutes, waiting for something either funny or exciting. Nothing at all.The movie's title made me fear the worst initially, but with all the rave reviews, I had to give this film the benefit of the doubt. Surely, 90% of critics cannot be out of their mind. Well guess what, indeed they can...This is a sad load of rubbish about rubbish people (yes, that includes blondie). Its only redeeming feature was that I only allowed it to waste 30 minutes of my life, rather than the intended 90 or whatever.There's this uninspiring joke of a guy who gets to sleep with a just as uninspiring promotion-happy Hollywood Barbie girl or something. She becomes pregnant, and I have no idea what happens after that but couldn't care to watch. Boring boring, annoyingly boring. 2 out of 10 just cos I only wasted half an hour."
1,So glad I did not go to the theater to watch it,I could not watch the entire movie...that is how bad I think the movie is.I read the other movies and rented it because of those reviews. Sorry but I did not think the first half of the movie was funny at all and I can not comment on the second half cause I deleted it. I think the movie is a total waste of time.
1,Why?,"Apart from about two jokes in this film, I wish I could get back that 2 hours of my life. I was ready to get up and leave within about the first 10 minutes, refraining only because my SO entertained the hope that it would get better. We were both let down on that note. Don't bother."
1,just not funny......,"Sorry, I just don't get it. this movie wasn't funny or entertaining.Ugly (on the inside) people doing ugly (on the outside) things.pointless without any redeeming virtue.is this what passes for entertainment today?any episode of "" Two and a Half Men"" is funnier and better written than this waste of time.and will Seth Rogen ever tire of playing the stoned loser? its really getting redundant and irrelevant.oh, and did I mention not funny.but I guess the main thing is the money keeps rolling in."
2,Foul,"Foul Language, Foul acting, Foul scenes, Foul characters, Foul everything. I was real excited to watch it-Love Katherine- but I was very unimpressed with just about everything in this movie. Very unbelievable that someone who is as successful and beautiful as Katherine's character would ever have a one-night stand with the doped up, dirty mouthed male lead character. Then, to top it off, once she finds out she is pregnant, actually hunts him down and forces him to part of her world and adapts pretty well to his. Not funny. Not fun."
1,"Gross, void, depressing and repulsive.","This movie (the characters and the dialogue) is just void of any type of class at all. I turned it off halfway through. A total waste of time. The lead male has absolutely no charisma or screen presence at all. Depressing,"
5,Two thumbs up ! ! !,Great comedy for adults. All of our worst nightmare a one night stand ending in pregnancy.
4,sweet,This was slightly funny with an extra helping of sweet..it seemed ..realistic in a sense..I liked it a lot
3,Knocked Up or Thrown Out,"This could have been a cute movie but the use of the F word every other word drove me nuts. My Mother who is 94 watched it with me. She was rather shocked. I watch movies to be entertained, not shocked. I am really sorry I Purchased this one for my collection. I certainly don't want my Great Granddaughter exposed to it. To say the least I was disappointed. I'm not a prude and sometimes the F word actually fits a scene but not every scene."
3,Great movie-but not one good laugh,"I saw both of Judd Apatow's films in theaters. The 40 year old virgin made me laugh so hard, I had to go to the bathroom twice. When I heard of Knocked Up, I knew I had to see it. I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the 40 year old virgin, but I still went to see it. I'm not Patricia. I'm her son, Brandon. Just like the 40 year old virgin, me and my friend Josh had to sneak in by buying tickets for spider-man 3. We weren't caught because Josh looks 21 but he's really 16. They didn't care. Anyway, I didn't even have to go to the bathroom at all. There are a few things that will get you to get just a little over a chuckle but all in all, there isn't one thing that made me just burst out laughing. But this is a good movie. Great story but a little too long. at 2 hrs. 13 mins. Judd overdid it."
5,Very funny movie.,"This was a very good and funny movie w/ a lot of heart. Althought, You may need to be careful who you bring to the movie theaters. It is definitely worth seeing. The critics are right about the good views. If you go and see the movie, you will have a great viewing experience."
1,simply brutal,"The dialogue alone is so unrealistic (seriously, who swears that much ALL THE TIME!?) and unfunny, I gave up. Yes, a doofus can score with a cute babe but when I heard these people speak I just thought the scriptwriter has no clue at all. It's one thing to throw stuff in to parody couples arguing but another to just have people go off on rants.Too bad this was not a horror movie as we could have killed off the annoying Seth Rogen in scene one. Then we might have a decent movie or at least have gotten Doughboy off the screen."
3,"JUDD APATOW, OPUS 2","*** 2007. Written and directed by Judd Apatow. Ben Stone and Alison Scott are going to have a baby. They don't know each other very well, they don't have the same interests and are not at all prepared to become parents. Coarse and crude, the film is presented as an example of the new American comedy. Why not, after all ? I smiled two or three times then vainly tried to find what the director wanted to tell us with KNOCKED UP and finally gave up. It wasn't worth the time and my energy. Already forgotten."
2,It was just ok.,"I think this movie could have been so much better. Some of the characters were much more interesting than the two main characters and it tended to drag on. If you don't have much going on and want something to watch while you are doing something else this movie is fine. You won't miss anything by having your focus elsewhere. But if you are looking for something to sit down and really watch, keep looking elsewhere."
4,Funny and True,"Lots of laughs, good acting and several ""oh, so true"" scenes on differences between female / male quest for the good life!!!"
1,What idiot came up with the title.....,Any man or woman with taste should avoid this trash at all costs. Yes the antucs are too vulgur and sickening. Just stay away.
2,Only a few things to like,"There are only a few things to like in this movie. First, two charming co-stars, unfortunately saddled with an empty script. Second, the movie depicts an unmarried couple who decide not to abort the baby they unintentionally conceive. That is a huge positive. Third, the reconciliation of a difficult relationship between these two people from vastly different backgrounds. A very good movie could have been built around these three positives. But, alas, the downside in this movie is that there is very little interesting or funny for anyone 17 years or over, as most of the dialogue is filled with gutter language and most of the ""jokes"" are scatological or drug-centered. If you are less than 17, you might like this movie, but you will have to attend in the company of an adult -- and that adult will not find much that is interesting or funny. Is this what entertainment has sunk to?"
5,Great Comedy ......and with a touch of reality,I love this movie. I could watch it a thousand times. This sort of thing happens to people alot. Not the exactly the same way..but you catch my drift.
2,Way too long,"I bought this movie because I heard from a lot of people that it was hillarious. About two hours into it, yes two hours, I was like ""is this still going"" and ""Is this over yet"". The movie wasn't very funny and was a waste of over two hours of my life and twenty bucks."
2,"My wife wanted to see it, but hated it.","Normally, my wife likes light silly romantic comedies. So, she thoughtthis would be the ticket. She hated it. (I only watched it to eat somepopcorn and because I remembered it having generally positivereviews.)Anyway, my wife thought it was ""infantile"" with too much obscenity, andwhen it was over she thought....so what? No interesting dramatic twists,no surprises, She also thought the prosthetic fake belly was obviouslyfake.I would agree with my wife on this one. A waste of time. Not very funny.One other thing. I checked out the special features. Some of them are,well, interesting. One of them makes the director look like something ofan obnoxious jerk. I wonder how they got included."
1,Horrid,"I did not find much funny in this movie. Seth Rogen had no redeeming characteristics. His insults and verbally vicious rants to Katherine Heigl was so bad that any woman who accepted it and took back that guy needs serious help.This is one of those movies that I just don't understand some of the 5 star reviews talking about it like it had some amazing meaning and was such a heart warming story. If anything in this movie is even close to normal for people, then I feel sad for their lives."
5,Laughed Out Loud...,"Any movie that makes me laugh out loud several times is a 5 star if you ask me. It was about 20 minutes too long but it was well worth it. Didn't love the drugs being so overdone and it was very unrealistic, but come on guys...it's a MOVIE. Enjoy it."
1,Garry From Atlanta,"I must say after reading all the great reviews, this was a mature disappointment. If you like a lot of profanity, maybe this movie is for you. However, we could only watch the first 45 minutes, then was disgusted and shut off the DVD and watched TV. This is definitely not a family comedy. I prefer comdedy done is good taste, and felt this has none."
1,Crapfest,"How did this make so much money at the cinema? Is it a comedy, is it a drama, or is it a commentary on marriage, abortion, etc??? Not funny in the slightest and a chore to get through. Blah."
4,"Yummy, easy recipes.",I got this book because I received the 6 ingredients or less crock pot book as a gift and loved the easy recipes. This book is the same. Just last week I had practically nothing in the house to cook but I found a recipe in the book that I had the ingredients for and it came out as a great meal.
1,Dumb Idea,OK Lets make food with the lowest possible ingrediants. Interesting for a game to pass the time; absolutly stupid for cooking. Usable only for 'challenged' cooks.
5,For Those Cuddly Moments that Make Life Worthwhile,"Michael Bond created that wonderful addition to our world called Paddington. The fact that Paddington is a bear, a little bear, a loveably naughty little bear, makes us love him even more. Imagine finding a forlorn little bear in the Lost Property Office with a little sign asking you to ""Please Look After This Bear. Thank You."" What would you do?The Brown's did not debate long in deciding to take Paddington with them to number thirty-two, Windsor Gardens, their home in London. Between mouthfuls of sweet marmalade and amazing adventures we follow Paddington through the London underground, in and out of shopping districts, all the way to the sea shore. Where ever this little bear goes, delightful trouble seems to follow him and leave us laughing and smiling and wishing we had a ""Paddington"" in our lives.A delightful book for children of all ages (even grey-haired ones!)"
5,Treasured edition/addition for your child's bookshelf!,"Entertaining, lovable, endearing. A Bear Called Paddington should have a home on your bookshelf -- though he may not remain there long after the first reading! Our family of 7 loves this storybook. Cross-cultural British vocabulary evokes a few queries as does his start in darkest Peru to a home in London, England -- which is good for more than a few trips to the map on the wall. A small, colorful illustration on almost every page keeps the young engaged but not so mesmerized in the art as to take them away from the storyline. Good, solid literature for all ages."
2,annoying sound!,"I love Plan toys, and this concertina exhibits the great construction I've come to expect from Plan. What I DON'T like is the sound! It plays two notes, one on the inhale and one on the exhale. Couldn't we have some finger holes to make different notes? It is easy enough for a toddler to play, but the sound it makes is so objectionable that most parents would hide it from their kids."
2,Not a pleasant sound,"I wish I loved the Plan Toys concertina as much as I love their drum or the adorable pull alligator toy. But oy. It just does not produce a single pleasant sound, which is especially ironic considering the product description claims quite the opposite (""Plays Pleasant Sounding Notes"") - hmmm...hardly. I'm not even sure we can claim it makes more than a single sound, which is one identical to a police car's siren.Giving it two stars if only because we still play with it every once in a while, and it remains part of our young toddler's music instrument collection (along with the above-mentioned drum, a glockenspiel, a guiro, etc.), but probably just for novelty's sake. It would be lovely if this were reworked so that it actually produced anything that could be remotely called ""music."""
4,Always gets a big smile,"I bought this while still pregnant. I saw another baby light up when his father played it for him. My daughter is only 7.5 months and can't play this alone. But, she loves when I play it. No matter what she is doing, she stops and looks at me and smiles so big. The noise is ok. I don't think a pretty sound is the point, I think it's just supposed to be fun for a child to make noise in the first place. My daughter enjoys chewing on this and rolling it around. I'm happy we have it.The placement of the hole could be better, but I don't think anyone would put their hand flat against the ends, you more cup the ends, thus allowing air in and out of the hole."
1,Not for a 19 month old,"The product description says for 19 months and up. I don't think so. This toy is pretty heavy and bulky. And squeezing it to make sound would require a lot of effort for a 19 month old. Another frustrating thing is they put the air vent for the toy to make sound right under the straps where you hold the toy, so you can't actually touch the toy while playing it, you can only hold the straps. Not very well designed."
5,Their best cd.,"with fourteen tracks on this cd the following I enjoy :1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,13,14. That means two I do not enjoy and they are barely even a minute long each. So two minutes of an hour cd I skip and sometimes I still listen to them because I just don't like how short they are. My favorite songs are Just a step away, Bradley, Loco, Big Truck, Sway, and Pig. If you have ... you should check out these songs because they are really good."
2,"Heavy, but...","Horrible lyrics. In my opinion, the worst I've ever seen. metal is all about thought-provoking lyrics, and this has none. Buy ""Dark Days"" instead."
3,"Bland, and not very talented","Besides Sway and Loco, Coal Chambers first cd isn't very good. It catches a Korn sound but seems a little more ""gothic"". Singer Dez Fafara (sp?) does some good vocals on the album on songs Sway and Bradley but seems to try and copy John Davis too much. All in all Chamber Music is 10000000 times better."
3,"Not very talented, but not bad....","Coal Chamber is an almost exact copy of KoRn without all the record sales. There music is dark and loud. The best song on the disc is ""Sway"", which has a catchy beat and funny lyrics. The downside on the album is that it is very inconsistent, some songs are good, some are ok, some just suck. I would skip this album and go right to their new one titled ""Chamber Music"""
4,A Great Record!!!!,"I have to agree with the people that say Coal Chamber's music is very simple. But in many ways, that is what makes it so fun. Does anyone remember how simple Nrvana was, and despite that they were great. Coal Chamber's debut shows how much prospect this band has. The opening track, Loco, really sums up the whole album. Simple, yet moving enough to make you want to throw yourself around. I don't get the whole goth thing though. I have heard many fans describe them as Goth, but I am sorry, if thats goth then Korn is country. I find nothing gothic about Coal Chamber's music. The only goth they represent is in their lead singer's looks. These guys are awesome and I can't wait to hear more from them."
4,The Secret,"I seen these guys in Maine before they were ever famous, at our ever famous Hempstock. Look the secret to coal chamber... buy this album, run away, don't buy anything else doing with them, and you will be fine... look at chamber music and it's all over you blew it!"
1,THE CORNIEST CD HAVE EVER HEARD!,WHAT CAN I SAY THIS CD WAS STUPID AND CORNY. WHEN I FIRST HEARD THEM I LIKED THEM THEM ONCE I HEARD THIS CD IT WAS STUPID AND CORNY.
2,Not so good,Tuned down guitars playin easy repetitive riffs while the lead singer screams dumb words. (ie- Big Truck) If you want new stuff that is good try In Flames.
5,Big Truck,"""Big Truck"" is an awsome song... I went to Ozzfest and they were there thank God!! All of Coal Chamber's music is awsome and this is the best album to get I encourage anyone who is into this type of music to at least listen to the music... You'll be mesmerized by their creations. Encouragment to all who likes Coal Chamber to buy this cd... the best!! ""BIG TRUCK"""
3,"DEZ,DEZ,DEZ,DEZ,DEZ,DEZ,DEZ,.........","Have you seen the picture on the back of the words inside? Tell me, doesn't Dez and Bug just look the fittest things on earth? Sway is the best song on the album as it is one to scare the crap out of your little brother or sister (note: it is also ideal for getting rid of unwanted neighbours)! Don't bother buying the album, tape it off your mates (don't forget to photocopy the pictures of the band)."
5,ROCK ON !,I LOVE THIS CD! AT FIRST ALL I BOUGHT IT FOR WAS THE APPERANCE OF JAY GORDON AND AMIR DERAKH BUT THEN I LISTENED TO ALL THE SONGS AND WOW! ITS GREAT! PEOPLE ARE SAYING ITS SO ORIGINAL AND IT IS BUT ITS A GOOD ORGINAL! I WOULD RECOMENED U BUYING IT!
4,BIG TRUCK ROCKS!,"Coal chamber rock! This a great CD, it's loud and great and sometimes even funny! Coal chamber's idea of rhyming is by saying the same thing over and over, but it's still really good. BIG TRUCK ROCKS!"
3,chamber music is going to rock,"I really like coal Chamber but I really don't like the first album that much. I know they can make better songs and thats why I can't wait for the new album. I am writing this 1 week before it is to be released so if you are reading this it is probably already out. Anyway, ""Not Living""is on the new one and it is awesome. But I heard it was a different version then what is on the ""Strange Land"" soundtrack. I also heard ""Notion"", It would be good but Dez says, ""I'ts just a notion."" about 50 times. Later y'all."
1,I can't believe I used to listen to this,"I recently popped in this CD after letting it collect dust on my CD shelf for 2 years and after listening to it, I wish I had left it sitting there to grow fungus. I can't believe that this is what I used to listen to! It's SO LAME! Dez's lyrics, well, they flat out stink! There is absolutely no thought or emotion put into these lyrics. All it is is him repeating the same phrase over and over again. Take ""Loco"" for example, all he does is scream ""Me Loco!"" over and over again. You could change the song title to ""Hungry"" and he would be screaming ""Me Hungry!"" over and over again. The riffs on here are such knock-offs from Korn's first album. Anyone who says they don't sound like Korn is just fooling themselves. This band is Korn without any passion or innovation... I don't quite know who these guys are fooling, but it ain't me."
1,boring wannabes who need to learn a few more chords,"Coal Chamber do a 2nd rate Korn/White Zombie impersonation. Low-tuned groove music, complete with 2-note riffs and semi-rapped vocals. The grooves and riffs just aren't good enough. This album bores me."
5,seems to me I need some identity,These guys are one of the most intense bands out there. I love them. You can't describe this CD with words. Listen for the whispers.
4,"Breaking, and Rocking",Coal Chamber is perhaps one of the best hard rock bands out there. They have a unique style that can not be duplicated. I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes Hard rock.
4,GOOOD CD!!!,"This is the band first full length album and this is like Nirvana's ""Bleach"" and good first album and there was still more to come. ""Loco"" , ""Bradley"" and ""Oddity"" are just some of there good songs. Plus this band has just finished touring on Ozzfest. END"
3,Stays crunchy even in milk,What can i say ? Coal chamber is/was a decent band. i really like Big Truck and Loco. Although this album sounds more than just a little bit like the first Korn album.
5,Their Best,"In my personal oppinion, i think this was Coal Chamber's best album. Each song on this cd has its own unique vibe to it. Dark Days had some good tracks but most of the songs start to sound alike after awhile. Chamber Music was also a very good album but not quite as good as this one. My favorite tracks on this cd are ""Loco"", ""Big Truck"", and ""Sway"". ""Oddity"" is also very good. The other songs are good too but not exactly best in my oppinion. ""Amir of the Desert"" is a short one (45 sec.), not too serious, but had me laughing the first few times with lines like ""Come to my desert, I'm gonna circumsize you"". I've heard ALOT of people compare CC to KoRn. I don't think they sound ANYTHING alike. Hopefully Coal Chamber plans on more releases like this one."
2,Bleh...,"I have to agree with pretty much all of the songs sounded the same. I really didn't see much in it. But if ya like punk/rock bands (ie: KoRn), then this is for you. I also have to disagree about ""true metal."" Too many people don't know what true metal is and use it too often."
3,Not as Good,Coal chamber is a great rock group and i love their music but really not what I expected I like their newer music check out Chamber Music.
3,Not too bad !,"This C.D is not too bad. I like the song (LOCO), it is really cool on video. A typical version of REAL metal. I like the style of the whole group. I think they are really cool.It's a pity this group are not and will never be better than Manson and his crew !"
1,"Boring, Repetitive, yet lacking.","It's nice to know that a band can make a 14 track CD where all but 2 tracks sound exactly the same & charge you for full price when you should only pay the price of a single. The guitarist hasn't done anything innovative (unless you count playing the same riff over & over agian groundbreaking). The lyrics are stupid & without meaning. The only thing interesting about this band is the fact that 4 Manson-ites decided on covering ""Blind"" & ""Bored"" instead of ""The Beautiful People""."
1,"they have the look, but nothing else","lyrical depth is a foreign concept to these people. it seems they heard a deftones cd and said, ""hey, WE could do that!!!"" but they were wrong. they are horrible. they should join limp bizkit and all those other cr**** ""hardcore"" bands and go back to jr college."
3,SX RX N RR,"I think Coal Chamber is a good band. I took a chance on it. I had never heard it, but a friend told me to try it. They do have the Korn-Sepultura style. Which is okay. Back in the 80's every band sounded alike. AC/DC has the same beat ever since they started. Metallica, Megadeth etc. all the same thing. It's the in thing right now. I really like ""sway"" but im pretty sure i heard ""the roof, the roof, the roof is on fire"" part somewhere. If u do know where that lyric comes from, please e-mail me, im curious. All in all I think Coal Chamber is a good band which is real heavy, and thats what counts right?? SX RX N RR (sex, drugs and rock'n'roll)"
2,No disrespect to coal chamber,"Coal chamber is okay but not even close to being better than korn. Korn has better lyrics and a way better bass player. Fieldy is the man. Coal chamber just wants to be like Korn too much. They need to work on their lyrics, and change their guitar riffs. Coal Chamber needs to be on another record label, and do their own music instead of copying what is already created."
3,"Good musically,poor lyrically","Overall, this album is not terribly consistent. I like the thundering downtuned guitars and bass, but the lyrics tend to well... suck.They really don't mean anything, and oftentimes are rather cheesy. I suppose if you crank up the bass, it's tolerable. Loco and Oddity are the best tracks. I hope Chamber Music is better."
1,"Cool fashion, but all the songs sound the same!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Sure Coal Chamber have 1 or 2 bad @$$ songs but all of them sound the same!!!! This is a band with no creativity, but awsome fashion!!!! Thsi band is also NOT goth, neither is slayer or fear factory. They are a ""hardcore"" band that need a little more work, AND A NEW LYRIC WRITER!!!! THAT GUY HAS GOT NO KNACK FOR WRITING!!! They lack the passion, and emotion of KoRn or Deftones and other hardcore/aggression bands."
5,Used Beauty,"This is one sharp lens, at macro unreal sharp, at normal shooting range very very sharp. Hard to take it off the camera, not because it fits too tight but it can do soooooo much. No zoom, but that's good I can move my feet."
3,Good resolution but focussing slips,"I actually own two of these lenses, I'm pairing them with 5D MKII bodies and doing copy work on a copy stand. The edge to edge sharpness is good, build quality nice, I'm getting my best results at F11. Unfortunately using copy stands the focus slips after a short period which is frustrating. I haven't had the need to use the auto focus but just playing it does seem quite loud. Looking back my have sprung for some Zeiss lenses but overall the sigma is a great value just exactly right for my needs. 3.5 would be my rating if I could go in halves"
5,Great Depth of Field,"This lens closes down to f/45, providing increased depth of field. I find it sharp, quite capable of producing superior images at all focal points."
5,Great Detail .. Affordable Price,"Bought this lens to assist in Small Product Photography. Since depth of field is normally limited in Macro Photography, the ability of this lens to stop down to F45 was crucial. The result was fine detail and color reproduction to the point where I could see my finger prints on the bezels of the watches. Got to wear cotton gloves!Don West Photography"
5,Great Macro Lens!!,I absolutely love this lens. It's very easy to use and produces pictures with amazing quality. I have had nothing but crisp and clear photos. I love the focal distance; makes it easy to get in close! This is my first macro lens and I am thrilled that I chose this one!
5,Works For Me,"I bought this lens to take macro photos of insects, and stuck it on my Nikon D80 years ago.It has never let me down.Mine has great glass--I've never looked at a shot and thought: Oh no, I should have used a better lens.Plus, since it cost very little (compared to others....), I will NEVER give it up--even though I've since bought fancier lenses by far because I never have to worry about Ooops! bashing it or dropping it when crawling around in the woods or through a marsh. I know I can replace it. And I would!"
5,A fantastic lens,"I purchased this lens to satisify my need for a macro lens. I was on the cusp of buying the Sony 30mm macro, but jumped on this one the moment I found it. It's a fantastic lens and hasn't been off my camera in a week. The images I captured are amazing. Great light, great DOF, very sharp.I own several Sigma lenses that I use with my Sony Alpha 300; I haven't been disappointed in any of them. The cost is always $100 less than the Sony equivalent, which is always a good thing.The only negative is that AF is impossible with this lens, but I prefer the control of MF so it's not that big of a deal.Enjoy!"
4,Great used lens in great condition,"This lens was well reviewed, but I only wanted it for occasional pictures of orchids, so this used lens was at a price point that was a good value for me. It arrived promptly, was well packed for shipping, had lens cap and rear cap. It functioned flawlessly and took very good pictures. I'm quite pleased with my purchase."
4,Give the new mayhem cd a chance!,"I just opened this cd and yes it is a bit weird sounding at times, because of the use of drum machines etc.. But over all there still burtal as hell! BUY IT YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!"
3,Not THAT bad...,"Like the first reviewer, I was very excited for this album to come out. Mayhem has always impressed me with their aggressive and unique music, and this wasn't what I was expecting. There are many inspired moments, particularly Hellhammer's ferocious drumming, but vocally this is album rather weak. There is no ""singing"" at all, but rather aggresive ""lecturing"". The music is quite good, even the short techno tune isn't all bad, but you'll find yourself listening to this album as much as you would a spoken word album; that is, it's good once or twice. This will eventually gather dust as you listen to their other albums. But at least they tried something new in a music genre lacking in many new ideas."
5,BRILLIANT,Forget all the bad reviews. This is the album where Mayhem finally got it together. This is the greatest black metal album ever recorded all the way.
5,DefJukies spread the word,"Mr. Lif has presented us with a concept album that truly defines the times we live in today. The idea of portraying the rise and fall of man in American society is a suject that the mainstream shys away from. The production compliments the substance of his rhymes perfectly. Not to be a hip-hop snob, but our first reviewer claims that one of the producers on this album, Edan, is an indie rapper from Boston. Well, Edan is an emcee from the D.C. area, Maryland to be exact. Pick up Edan's first album, Primative Plus, and you'll hear an amazing track with Mr. Lif. Wake up Sleepyheads."
5,punx,"...Lif however drops a fresh album, the lyrics are true (even though you might not agree with them), the beats are original (they take some time to get used to, but that's true for all good music) and the whole recording sounds crisp like my breakfast cereal. It's just dope."
1,Mr. Lif's Wackness shocks his old fans,"""Wow a new Mr. Lif disc!"" came out of my mouth when I saw I phantom sitting on the shelf amoungst all the independant labels. Obviously I bought it and rushed to the car to play it on the way home, thats when the trouble started... not only was I not feeling one track on the whole disc... but it all sounded like terrible old school. I have heard better beats put together from local artist who dont have a dime to spend... what was mr. lif thinking? I shoke my head as I took it out of the player ""Hard to Imagine that Jedi Mind Tricks had this cat on their Cd"" . Where is the cd now? probably disapointing another old fan that bought it from me via- online."
5,cop it,"a near perfect album from start to finish few filler tracks but overall solid. personal favorite mr. lif album, best song=success"
5,Def Jux is taking over Hip- Hop,I think everybody should have this cd. The story behind I Phantom is awesome. This cd has alot of good political and family life views. It's a good story about the wack American Dream.
2,Unfulfilling #2,"""Unfulfilling"" took the words from my mouth. Exactly my experience, bought on the power of a ""Best Of..."" review. Almost every track just makes me cringe for some or all of its length."
4,Mostly a Shortwave overview,"I bought this one (the E10), the Grundig/eTon 1100 (around $50), the Grundig/eTon 350 large (field) radio, and the Freeplay wind-up/solar ""Summit"" shortwave radio. I returned the Freeplay wind-up/solar ""Summit"" and Grundig 1100 radios because they hardly picked-up one or two Shortwave stations. (By the way: the ease of tuning of the Am and Fm was super on the Grundig 1100). As for the two I kept: This E10 had the same ability to pull in shortwave stations as the '8-10 times larger' Grundig 350 ""field radio"", but with the 350's much larger speaker, I could hear the stations a little more clearly. But if you want small size, and good shortwave receptivity, the E10 is the choice, for around $100. But don't expect any shortwave radio under $100 to pull-in stations during the daytime inside an apartment/concrete building."
2,"use it for awhile, then decide","I've had an Eton E10 for 2 and 1/2 years, and initially would have given rave reviews about it when new. After VERY limited use, the flip stand on the back of the unit broke, and although it's a small thing, for this kind of radio, at this kind of price, that shouldn't happen. I've soured a bit on the E10 after finding similar, if not superior performance from a couple of Radio Shack DX- 350's I purchased used for not even half the price of the E10.Don't be fooled by the E10's nice sound, and good looks. Use it for awhile and then you decide whether it's enough shortwave radio for the price tag."
4,"Once into it, hard to want to leave, first lines grab.","The first paragraphs let you know that this isn' going to be like anything you've read before. Your attention is demanded, and when you think that you've mastered the twists that Ms. Hege creates, she deivises new ones. There is no predicting beyond the certainty that characters will be swiflty and accurately laid before the reader, that there will be surprises and that you will be engaged. Reading it as a man, husband and father, I found that it gave new views and insights into the way that a profess"
4,A Lesson in Writing,"An excellent read for anyone interested in the writing process. How ironic it is that I'm writing this review and still have 12 pages of the book left to read. The novel started off with a rather fast pace, then life's ""intrusions"" begin to impact my reading time. I'm currently at the point where I want to finish this book and start another; but I can't seem to get beyond selecting paint for the dining room, evaluating stocks for the investment club, finishing my taxes, figuring out how to recover lost time on a project at work, blah, blah, blah. . . .. Hegi's writing continues to impress me, with Intrusions and Stones From The River, she's two for two in my book. Intrusions is creative, witty, and psychologically stimulating. Writers and writing teachers should really enjoy this one."
5,Art vs. Guilt,"Liked this book very much. Hegi does an excellent job exploring the search for creative authenticity and the guilt of following one's own deepest, and often conflicting, desires."
5,"Hegi's most creative, innovative novel","Sometimes hilarious, sometimes tragic, this novel introduces an entirely different style of writing.As the author struggles to complete the novel, the characters try to go by the book, literally! and when they can't, the characters have hearts to hearts with her. It's a wonderful investment of time!"
3,"Lasted 3 years, then suddenly died.","I bought one of these 80GB Buslink drives a few years ago, back when 80GB seemed like a lot of storage. It lasted a while and served me very well, with quick access speed and no maintenance necessary.Suddenly last week it stopped working - my computer can see the drive letter, but can no longer access the drive. I used this only as backup for photo and mp3 files so there's nothing essential on it, but obviously I'm disappointed it didn't last longer.I'd take it in for repair or data salvage, but the cost of salvage is too high - cheaper to just buy another! But I'll be buying a SimpleTech drive instead, as they seem to offer larger drive sizes for less money, and the reviews are fairly positive."
4,Nice Introduction To The Series,"This 3-disc ""Whistler"" set offers a good sampling of 6 episodes. When I first heard these, I was taken by The Whistler's narrative & delivery, and purchased additional sets from Radio Spirits. The ""Custom Build Blonde"" episode is the only ""strange story"" exclusive to this set; the other 5 episodes (""Seven Steps to Murder"", ""Murder on Margin"", ""Concerto of Death"", ""Small Town Girl"" & ""Fatal Appointment"") are part of other collections. Anyway, if you enjoy hearing characters getting caught in their own web, and a host who ranks along with those from ""Mysterious Traveller"" & ""Inner Sanctum"", this is a good place to start. ""Yesss..."""
4,Eureka MM 9-pack,"It delightful to know that you can acquire hard to find products with a few taps of your fingers. The vaccuum almost got the ""heave-ho"" because we couldn't find original quality replacement bags. So glad I thought to come here.....!!!!!"
3,It's ok.,"Not the worst social studies book in the world - a little dry and boring. If you need a book on ss for elementary education, it is just ok."
5,So peaceful and relaxing!,"""Japanese Gardens"" was exactly what I was looking for! Beautifully photographed images of waterfalls, water ways, statuary and lush greenery. There are three choices to view - two with soft music and one with only the sounds of nature. And best of all - on a loop, so that each one repeats until you're ready to change it or turn it off.For me, this DVD is not only relaxing and meditational, but also the perfect antidote to cable news."
5,Japanese gardens,WOW this is truly eye candy So beautifully photographed Stunning tranquil scenes so peaceful as in my opinion only the Japanese can do You cannot go wrong with this video so buy it and ENJOY!!!!
5,excellent delivery service,The book itself was not quite what i expected.. a bit on the childish side. My niece is 7 and didn't find this book very interesting unfortunately.
5,Love it!,My 3 year old loved this! She was able to share the stickers. I loved that it taught words in various languages.
3,"Hello Kitty, Hello World!",It isn't exactly what Ruby wanted. More over her head. She really wanted a book to read herself and she is just beginning to read.
1,Discouraging and Radically Religiously Biased,"This book is disquised as a self-help book but is actually anti-gay propaganda that reinforces stereotypes against gay people and attempts to promote hatred of gay people through the distorted premise of ""Love the Sinner, Hate the Sin"". I found it disturbing."
1,Unbelievably bad advice,"Thinly disguised as compassionate counseling for parents, this is another in a long line of books shoveled out by religious zealots. This book uses discredited research and advocates dangerous and harmful tactics to try and force your child out of being gay. Buy any book by Wayne Besen on the subject for a thorough dismantling of these crackpot theories. Then buy Now That You Know for a truly appropriate and positive resource for learning how to respond to your son or daughter's coming out."
4,El Sol de Breda,"As always Perez-Reverte engages you with his own take of history as Spain struggles to retain control and possession of her empire, this time of Holland. His description of the way war was fought then, the uniforms or mixed bag of personal accoutremonts to deflect possible thrust of swords and javelins via coletos de bufalo, morriones, and celadas and the traditional valones of Spanish pirates are just examples of how well researched are his books.My grandfather being an Andalucian brought with him familiar words to the Philippines, which my father peppered his speech with as we grew up and many of these words are scattered in this wonderful book. Por vida del Rey juro que el tercio de Cartagena eran hombres de pelo en pecho!"
1,aburrido y de lectura espesa,"Este libro me ha resultado muy aburrido, porque el autor se pierde en divagaciones. Las descripciones son demasiado exactas, y casi siempre no vienen a cuento de la trama. Me hubiera gustado más que el autor se centrase en la aventura y en la acción, y evitado en lo posible enrollarse con detalles que hacen perder el encanto de loa novela. Quizá parezca raro, pero para mí el final(en el que Íñigo Balboa cuenta lo sucedido en Breda a Velázquez para que pinte el cuadro), es lo mejor del libro.Personalmente, prefiero las dos primeras novelas de la saga del capitán Alatriste, y recomiendo, porsupuesto, al lector amante de la intriga, ""La tabla de Flandes"" y ""EL Club Dumas."""
4,tells about top schools with an informal approach,This book is not for the quant jocks. tells a story not a lot of numbers but gives the important stuff that every other book has.
5,Sick,This is great grip tape and its so cool!! My hands are shreded from touching the stuff thats how good it is. The cut out of the key logo makes it an Alien Workshop original. Its prety easy to get on too. The hardest thing is getting the key logo on there. I recomend just cutting it out then putting it on like a sticker. Overall this is the best grip tape i have used its another alien workshop product thats above the rest.
4,Elvis' Promised Land,"This was a present, and the person to whom I gave it was very pleased with it. Promised Land is his favorite Elvis song."
5,Complete and concise introduction to patent law,"I read this book while preparing for my patent law exam at law school. I found it very useful: it is a complete and up to date introduction into the patent act and how it is applied by the Patent and Trademark Office and the courts. It contains all necessary references that a lawyer needs but the language is clear enough that an interested layman can understand it as well. It is not a ""How to get a patent yourself book"" however - it is for laywers or for people used to reading legal texts."
5,Down-to-Earth Crystal Homeopathy,"This is the best book I've seen for correspondences between the vibrations of specific crystals and everyday physical-mental-emotional phenomena. Melody covers more obscure stones, Dorothy Roeder (Crystal Co-Creators) covers spiritual aspects better, and Michael Gienger (Crystal Power, Crystal Healing) provides more background detail than anybody, but this book is the one I use for choosing crystals for specific issues. It's not illustrated, but pictures of most of the stones in it can be found at www.jbuss.com . Another nice feature - the index includes stone names, not just page numbers."
5,Awesome reference book,"Easy to navigate and understand. Great book, very accurate for all kinds of information on stones. Where they come from, composition and healing properties."
5,It Works!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This product is phenomenal! I had some darker spots on my fact and around my eyes and after a month of usage its all gone. Also, it makes my skin smoother. I saw my family after being away for a few months and they were shocked about the difference in my skin tone. Beautiful!"
4,What I was looking for.,I love this fragranonce and they don't leave me feeling greasy or. sticky. I also like the thicknesss and that they are not too heavy.
2,Allergic! And it took too long to find out...OUCH!,The delivery and service were great. Sadly the product was not good for me. I became terribly allergic and developed blisters everywhere!
5,Amazing Accomplishment,"This book is so amazing. I read it on a whim because it was the summertime and I had a deep interest in Jeff Buckley but did not know much about him. I read the book and not only did I feel I thoroughly knew Jeff, but I understood his family, especially his father, as well.Some people say that it was wrong to posthumously lump Tim and Jeff Buckley together after Jeff fought for years to separate himself from his famous father. I believe that note should be taken of this, but in order to understand Jeff's need to be a separate being and in order to prove how different the two were, one had to write about the both of them in order to show their contrasts and in some cases their similarities.The book is quite an accomplishment. At times it is graphic and sentimental and others it is technical and factual. Overall, it is a wonderful piece of work, especially since Jeff only died in 1997."
3,Wrong product shipped.,I ordered this product from Amazon.com using the technical specifications offered and the pictures provided. What was delivered was the wrong cord and required me to purchase an adapter. The cord was also missing the pictured screw on locking ring. I decided it was easier to purchase an adapter as opposed to shipping the 50 foot ford back. Clever scheme to get you to purchase more products.
4,The Definitive Puccini Biography,"This is the alpha and omega of literature on Puccini and eliminates the need to look elsewhere. Carner's access to family history and Puccini's personal correspondence make this a definitive reference. By the same token, it is highly readable for a scholarly biography. It can be read for enjoyment as well as information -- as such, it is a good match for Puccini's art."
2,"A bit of this, a bit of that.","This book is targeted on people who are suffering from something and want to do acupressure on themselves. Personally, I was looking for a book about performing acupressure on someone else!First of all, this book includes Acupressure, Shiatsu, reflexology and a little bit of yoga (Very briefly). For a 386 page book, it is just too many topics to cover, and it's understandable that nothing is in depth. Secondly, the pictures are just as brief as the writings. Finally, the A-Z guide covers a lot of topics from Acne to tinnitus to impetance to PMS, it takes up the book from page 78 onwards.My conclusion is, this book is no where detailed enough for someone who is serious about acupressure, and for someone who wants to do a little acupressure on themself, unless you suffer diseases from A-Z, you'll only find 10 pages of this book useful. Hope this information is more useful than the book......."
4,Black & White Drawings,"The information as far as text (information) is excellent; however, It would be much better if it came with full color pictures instead of simple drawings--which makes the points hard to find.A much better approach (with full color [real] pictures) is:*****ACUPRESSURE -Naturally Better. By: Carola Beresford Cooke, Peter Albright.It gets to the point--literally speaking--without so much unnecessary explanation. By the way, I found out about this book through somebody else's previous review (on this book)."
4,Needed this alot.,I have several different muscle problems and find this book has many good discriptions of muscles and how to use the therapy.
3,Don't get the Kindle version,"Don't get the Kindle version. For starters, this is one of those inexplicable instances where the publisher has set the price for the Kindle version higher than the price for the print version. The other reason is because, to use this book as a reference, you have to keep flipping back and forth between different sections of the book to find the locations of specific acupressure points. Doing this with a Kindle book is extremely tedious. It's much easier with the print version. It would help a little if the Kindle version had a clickable index of points and conditions, but even with that, using a print version would be easier. The actual content of the book is as good as any I've seen on the subject."
4,There for the aching!,"As a person who is very active in physical fitness, as well as, stress prone, I found this book to very necessary, indeed! I ordered this book, looking for something that would help me with all the aches and pains and tension that I regularly build up in the average day. Well, I found it! The book is very thorough and easy to follow. It gives a step-by-step instruction to relieving symptoms with pressure-point therapies that work. However, the skills in this book require patience and practice. There are no ""instant"" buttons...to my dismay."
5,What's it all about,"I saw some articles on WebMD, pondered the idea, went to Amazon.com and bought a book. The book is easy enough to read/understand and the described locations were real easy to find...and you KNOW it when you find it. Haven't come to the point where I notice much of a difference yet, but I have a good source of information of what to do."
2,More is Less,"If you want to learn acupressure this is not the best book in the field. It is not even the best book in the bookstore. It's a little bit of acupressure, a little reflexology, a little shiatsu, a little herbology, and a little nutrition. The book lacks an index and a table of contents which makes finding specific information difficult. Overall, a waste of time and money."
2,Music Box Dancer should have been a single!,"I really love the ""Music Box Dancer"" and there was actually one other cut on the CD that was in the same genre. I suppose the other songs included were ""okay"" - and maybe I am being too picky - but the quality of the CD was not up to snuff. Reminded me of being in a bavarian restaurant listening to rather canned music -with the notable exception of the two songs I mentioned. I intend to just put the album into my music library and ""rip"" the two I like and never play the CD again.But I believe the purchase was worth it. Just should have been a single, and I would have paid the same for it...."
4,Mom loves it,"My mother had a record of this years ago, which she had forgotten. I got her the CD and she loves it. She is in her 50's. I like it, too-it's got catchy intrumentals. No vocals."
4,Nice collection of music,Was a nice collection of music although I only knew personally the title tune. Made for nice listening music on a long car trip.
3,"lots of sexy girls, but faulty production","Hey, there's a lot of great-looking and sexy girls here, no doubt about it. They're mostly shown in wet-t and bikini contests. But the camera-work knocks this down to three stars. For one thing, to me there's too much manipulation of the image. Often, the girls are shown in a jerky, discontinuous manner, or switching from color to black-and-white and back, and so on. Come on, guys, these girls are their OWN special effects, and we don't need all that manipulation of the image! And in some segments, the camera-work is substandard - not held steady, too far away, wandering aimlessly, etc. Also, the DVD would have been helped much by having more intimate and longer looks at specific girls. There's only a little of that. So overall, I'd say this DVD is OK, but I don't really recommend it."
5,A series of introductions to many traditions,"While reading the material, I found myself exposed to many traditions that may have taken many books or years to discover. The Shambhala tradition is well discussed and overall I enjoyed the exposure to several other ways of thinking and seeing."
4,A good reference for sand casting.,"This is a good reference book. The techniques are from the turn of the century, but they are still useful. The illustrations are helpful."
5,PJ'S,These pajamas were well worth my money they are very warm and very compfortable I would definitly buy another pair.
2,It didn't work for me. :(,"I actually got this for a friend of mine who lost her camera battery charger, but it was too big for her battery. However, my other friend took it to see if it would work for hers, and I have not received it back yet so maybe it does work. *shrugs* Oh well."
3,charger review,"The charge is a bit bigger than the one provided with the P510 kit. It could have been better it the description stated it comes with an external chord. I was hoping it be only single square piece with fold in plug, which it is NOT. Iam a bit disappointed."
5,So glad I found this!!!,"I lost my battery charger months ago and after fruitless searching of my entire house, I just couldn't find it. I looked in every local store for a new charger and found nothing. I finally decided to check out Amazon and am so glad I did. Not only did I find the right charger, it was a lot less expensive then I thought it would be. So happy to be able to use my camera again!!"
3,great nikon battery charger!,I bought this charger because i had lost the other one. This one is perfect and it charges in no time!
2,Disappointed,"I was surprised to open the box to this charge and find that it came with a very, very heavy cord. Am traveling to Africa on Safari and weight is a big restriction. Seems like Nikon could save money by just making this charger with the collapsible plug on back. Would have been nice if pictures of item had shown the cord, also."
1,Not a genuine Nikon product,"This is not a genuine Nikon product. Nikon has confirmed to me that its serial number indicates it is a gray market product.There are two tip-offs that it is fake. One, the charging lamp stays a continuous yellow instead of blinking, as described in the manual. Two, the cord is about two feet long. The genuine product has a 70.9 inch cord."
4,nikon MH 61 battery charger,"I am happy with the charger except for the fact that i never know when the battery is fully charged, since the light stays on all the the time without blinking or shutting off."
2,It comes with a power cable.. :(,I don't understand how it doesn't show in any of the pictures that it comes with a bulky power cable. So I send it back and got this one PRO SERIES AC & DC Nikon MH-61 from Amazon :)
5,A must have,If you have two batteries at least you must have one of these. It's perfect for my P500 batteries. Don't let your batteries charge in the camera it may harm it because it will get warm.
5,Great Required Recharger!,"Lithium-ion batteries last longer than AA batteries, but you will still need this accessory for recharging. I'd suggest buying at least one other battery to alternate. It will take 1.5-2 hours to recharge one battery fully. You can also buy an adapter for travel overseas. You don't want to be stuck in paradise without enough batteries and Lithium-ion batteries are not readily available everywhere. This recharger is less expensive than most."
3,"Better, not optimum","This is a more convenient way to charge a Nikon camera battery than lugging around a cable to plug into the camera. Strangely, though, it doesn't include an integrated or foldable AC plug -- you still need a power cable."
3,Not very compact!!!,"I bought this because I needed a wall charger instead of the computer charger that came with my Nikon P100 camera. I expected (from the picture) that it had the flip out plug and would be very compact like others I have. But Nikon has chosen to use a detachable power cord instead, so you also have to lug around the wa-a-a-a-y long power cord with the charger. We travel alot, and space and weight are big considerations, so this was very disappointing to me. It would have, at least, been nice to know that this was the case when I ordered it, but none of the pictures or descriptions said anything about it having the separate power cord.The upside is that it does work."
1,Read the other reviews,"I should have read all the reviews before ordering. Like others, i do not feel this is a real nikon charger. Mine too arrived in a plain yellow envelope, with no paperwork or box. Also comparing it to a genuine nikon charger I received, it did not compare. It did not function like the other, looked cheaper, weighted less, and the cord was only about a foot long when the genuine one is the correct 6 foot long cord as described on the nikon site. It is hard to find this charger, but look around and find before ordering from here. Hope my refund comes soon."
3,Charger shipped without power cord,I ordered a Nikon MH-61 battery charger for my husband's Christmas present. The charger was shipped without a power cord even though Nikon's website for the charger shows under Tech Specs that the charger is supposed to come with a 71 inch power cord. Phone calls to Amazon Customer Service have been no help in resolving this problem.
1,Get rid of the wall cord !!!!!,"I purchased the Nikon MH-61 camera battery charger because Nikon did not include one when I purchased thw Nikon P-500. You have to plug in the camera to charge the battery. Bad idea.I always carry a spare battery so a good charger means a lot to me.A rapid charge charger that plugs directly into the wall outlet would have been the answer but Nikon for some strange reason wants you to have to carry around a charging cord??With the battery model I will be able to find a small, portable wall charger so I can keep my spare battery on charge while using the one in the camera. A send the coard to Nikon. Maybe they will fet the message.BillNC"
4,works as expected,"I swap batteries a lot so the charger makes sense. Works as expected. At first I didn't like the cord, thought they should have the electric prongs built in. But when I went to plug it into my power strip I realized that had the prongs been built in, it wouldn't fit in with everything else."
1,Save your $ and buy something else!,"Anyone who pays for this program has paid too much. Open Office is totally free software, available for download at it's official site, openoffice.org. There, you can download it as many times as you want, get support from their forums, and not pay a dime.I use Lotus Symphony, which is also free, and which I have had better luck with. It's based on Open Office, but I have not had the problems with it that I had with Open Office."
5,A must read book for historical fiction lovers!,"Tituba of Salem Village was a good book, I enjoyed this book because it kept you reading. The only slow part was when the story got to the middle there was a lull in action but it all had to do with the plot and in the end, was all worth reading. It was about a slave who moved from her original master in Barbados and only dreams of going back. She is now in cold, cruel, unwelcoming Salem Village. Now they suspect her and others to be involved in witch craft after some very strange things happen. I would definitely read this again and I hope you have the opportunity to as well."
3,This book made the Salem Witch Trials come to life,"This book gave me a lot of background about the Salem Witch trials. It was very imaginative and I liked the way the characters seemed like real people, especially Mercy Lewis and Tituba. Abigail was a real piece of work. I think Goody Good really was a witch, and the way Ann Petry describes her with her cackling laugh and the evil smell she leaves everywhere makes me think the author wants you to think that. This makes me wonder if some of the people who were accused as witches really were witches. It was sad to see what life was like for slaves like John and Tituba. One thing I didn't like about the book was that it made New England seem cold and depressing, and I've read other books that made me wish that I'd been born back in Colonial days because people worked together and had a lot of fun, even though life was hard."
3,Factual details likely in error,"While the book was well written and interesting, many of the factual details seem to disagree with current information on the Salem Witch Trial Websites. Likely, because it was written in 1964, much scholarly research has uncovered new information. So don't use it as your only source on this topic. errors in childhood, marriage, background and other things."
3,Salem Witch Trials,"Tituba was considered by many as a fictional character in Arthur Miller's play, ""The Crucible"". This young person's novel gives Tituba a chance to tell her story. This copy was used and the cover was bent and torn, which I did not expect. But it is still an interesting read."
3,Good for Kids,"I am have loved this book since I was a very little girl. I think you will like it if you like historical fiction, but that doesn't stick to facts to tightly. Mercy Lewis was/is my favorite character."
1,Interesting but very slow and BORING,Tituba is the slowest books i've ever read it could be summed up in 10 pages. It does have some interesting plot to it about the salem witch trials/
5,Great Read!!,I met the author at a book signing in Oregon and decided to give the book a try. Found that it was very well written and hard to put down. I am looking forward to reading more of his work.
2,Nah!,Material is low quality so I dont expect it to last that long. I have only worn it once and it has that shiny coating which is not the greatest according to me. I like the styling and it is comfortable to wear. Overall it is just another shoe..not a winner.
2,Not what I wanted,This seemed like a mediocre reference to me. I returned it a day after recieving it in the mail. Perhaps it is more appropriate for the more eastern Great Lakes. Minnesota streams were mentioned on only two pages.
4,"Complex, technical Death Metal","One word for this album...wow. An amazing drummer, complex guitar, clear Death vocals, and eloquent lyrics make this one of the best Death Metal albums I've heard. The music is pretty technical, many transitions from low rythmns to high riffs. Above average lyrics on a multitude of subjects, though all are quite 'evil'. Very good production, crisp and clear, and some neat intros. The last song a remix of 'Breeding the Spawn' which was a song from an earlier album of theirs by the same name, and they have improved it. And the cover art is amazing!! END"
5,Purchased solely due to the glowing Amazon reviews,"And they were correct! This band is pretty impressive if you already enjoy death metal. Hard to pick a best instrument as the drums, bass and guitars are all top notch. But the vocals, I'd have to say, may be some of my favorite death vocals of all.Not much to add, except the music is some of the most hungry brutal death metal around. Not all death metal of this type manages to stay fresh, but Suffocation really have it down. Definitely a cut above the rest of the pack.Can't compare ""Pierced . . "" to other Suffocation releases, yet, but I do plan to check out the rest of their catalog."
4,When Suffocation was king...,"This is one of Suffocations strongest albums. Quite technical, and overall excellent songs. I found the energy level to be high as well. The singers voice sounds much better than it has in years and I look forward to listening to this album every time I put it in the CD player."
5,KICK ASS!!!,"These guys kick ass! Suffocation's songs are the equivalent of taking a person and totally dissecting their soul to reveal all there secrets and make them revel in it. Every song here exposes human weakness and turns the knife in your back even harder. people call them technical, brutal, grind or whatever. All i know is that they created a subgenre within a genre and are the best band telent wise to ever walk the earth!!"
5,Ripping Grind DEATH and its best,Look no further for destruction and masterfully created music. Suffocation just straight up kicks @#$. I was fortunately lucky enough to see them at the wiskey in hollywood on their Despise the Sun tour and that cd just piles right on top of suffocations mountain of metal. Cherish these cds for there will be no more because suffocation is no longer.
5,The best Death Metal Album of all time,"If you like Death Metal, or just heavy music for that matter, this is one album you HAVE to have. There is nothing like this band anywhere. Incredibily heavy and techinicaly perfect, the epitome of death metal."
5,Premium Death Metal.,"You will not find a better death metal album anywhere, ever, period. The standard has been set, and will be nearly impossible to exceed. Nor will you find a better death metal band anywhere, ever, because these guys can reproduce this live, and that is the most impressive aspect. They played Milwaukee Metalfest two years ago and blew everyone else out of the building. The biggest dissapointment was their short stage time, as they only were allowed five songs. But three were from this album, and they were note for note. Put it this way: if there was only one album to be stranded on an island with, this would be it."
2,COMPLETLY OVERATED,"I heard all of the hype circled around this album and immeditly i wanted to pick it up. All of the reviews said it was technically amazing and a death metal classic. when i finally picked it up I was dissapointed for several reasons. one being the slow and boring grind riffs that deaden up the death metal feel. another is the fact that I've heard this same thing from other more superior death groups. they do not have a memorable sound that really grabs you.and finally the technicallity is not that great at all, which i thought it was going to be, not compared to the likes of Cryptopsy or Nile thats for sure.In all it is totally overated and definitly not a classic. pass this one up and check out: Carcass- necrotism... impaled, dying fetus, deeds of flesh, or a f**kin' Slayer album!!!!! nuf said."
1,...Discontinue drug use immediately.,"... this is a yawner. suffocation's first EP 'Human Waste' was amazing; it shook the underground. everyone was prepared for a band that could come out and conquer. but they never once matched the inginuity of that demo. this album is the one that made me stop bothering to listen to them at all anymore. if you're a fan of metal, you've heard all of this before. as one other reviewer said, yes they're all talented but to what end? does it matter when the music is [weak]?....i love the suffocation guys, they're great, but this album is pointless. they only reason it gets one star from me is that it won't let me put zero stars."
5,Fist Of Legend,"This is my all time favorite death metal album. Ever. And as we speak now I am utilizing every resource I have to get more good dm as I always have. Nothing comes close to this.. Not Legion by Deicide, not Bleeding By Cannibal Corpse.. not one of the great Cryptopsy or Dying Fetus albums come close... there is a band called Decapitated that has a ... 'similar sound' but this is the best ....."
3,"Get ""Effigy of the Forgotten"" instead...","...unless, of course, you already have it. This album is not as interesting as ""Effigy"". Sure, you might argue it's technically superior, but what happened to the raw, gurglely vocals? I miss it. And the more syncopated beats are lost too, but not totally. This is a solid album, but I can't see why a lot of you perceive it as one of the best death albums ever. It's not."
2,Doesn't do it for me.,"So sorry people, but I just can't fake an interest in this band. I think that they're boring and devoid of any form of creativity. The drumming while technical, is completely lacking as far as heart and soul goes. It just sounds as if Doug Bohn is going through the motions. Oh, and Frank Mullen is nothing special as a Death Metal vocalist. In my opinion, he's just a gruff, bear chanting vocalist with a little more clarity than say, Chris Barnes of Cannibal corpse. Go listen to Amon amarth's ""The crusher"" for a better assault on your ears. Later."
3,Am I missing something?,"I want to start this off by saying i am a HUGE Death Metal fan. Why did i only give this 3 stars you ask, this is not very good. It seems rather repedative and lacks creativity. NOTHING on this sticks in my head NOTHING is memorable. Sure i have lots of respect for Suffocation but not on this album. They have all the key elements to making a great album except catchyness which to me is a important part in Death Metal. Buy this only if your a diehard fan of Suffocation..."
2,Yawn,"If you want to hear these guys at their best check outBreeding the Spawn and Effegy of The Forgotten and forgetthis one. Yeah this is technical, fast, and brutal but comparedto their early work this seems sterile and boring."
3,Too farcical to be in anyway witty,"And it really is nothing. They all lie to one another. They all are mentally deficient in a way or another. They all want to make an easy dollar, or rather an easy $100,000 that turns a just as easy $2,000,000. And they don't know what to do with it and the complications.It's a generic remake of a Coen Brothers' film. You might find it funny, but it is a gross comedy with a touch of romantic attachment and a stroke of vain and painless silliness. The film has no meaning whatsoever. It is just a farce.But if your stomach is slightly delicate, better abstain. A septic tank stinks. Vomiting in the bouquet in the living room stinks. Killing someone with an axe in the middle of the skull stinks. Killing a diabetic person with an overdose of sugar stinks? Killing some one or oneself with an overdose of concentrated valium stinks. ETC.But, like all farces, it is funny ah-ah and nothing else.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
4,This Big Nothing is Hilarious Fun!,I didn't know what to expect either as I inserted this disc into my player.I tried not to compare with Shaun Of The Dead or Hot Fuzz which left my mind opened.The one writer has commented that the fat guy should of been shot.....Nah he's a diabetic soooo let him eat CANDY! That's british humour right there.This is a dark comedy and its great.This is Employee Of The Month Brit style with double crossing and trusting no one.Mimi Rogers is cool as the Rev's wife who has learned about his habit.The film is about Charlie{David Schwimmer} who teams up with Gus{Simon Pegg} and Alice Eve to blackmail a man of the cloth for 200 thousand dollars and it all goes wrong! This thing has more twists than a pretzel.Its funny and downright mean spirited but enjoyable.I recommend Big Nothing and you'll get a Big Something .......A GREAT MOVIE!
4,'Big Nothing' Review,"A 'dark comedy' that has plenty of twists to keep us watching. I do adore Simon Pegg, and this was another great role for him as a fellow telephone sales worker who has a plan that gets him, and a disillusioned co-worker, in trouble. I found the 'phone scene' especially funny...who hasn't wanted to bark similar things into a phone when trying to make a sale? You find yourself wanting the so called 'bad guys' to win and get away with the money in this one.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,Big nothing is nothing big to miss...but the soundtrack,"I thought this movie might be good since simon pegg was in it (shawn of the dead, hot fuzz), and hoped that david schwimmer wasn't to bad. unfortunately, I just didn't care that much for this movie. But, the soundtrack was awesome, bringing up many good rock songs and even digging up some of the late 90's/00's best little bands, like Local H, who had 2 songs in the film..Hands on the Bible (here comes the zoo), and Bound for the floor aka copasetic (as good as dead). For this reason, this movie gets 3 stars, otherwise, I would have given it a low 2 star. Rent this one."
1,JUNK,DVD does not work. Went out and bought it again when it didn't work. You get what yuou pay for and it was cheap.
1,Nothing is right,"Having never suffered through David Schimmer doing 'Friends' and now having seen him try to act.I have to ask myself,how does he get work? This guy is pathetic.The story is a wee bit above average and the rest of the cast passes through at least earning their checks But as a whole it's boring as hell and a sub par vehicle for Ms.McElhone.Avoid this one and any other attempt Schimmer makes at acting."
1,Very disappointed,"I was hoping this program would give my kids some extra learning for their homeschooling, but was a complete waste of time and money. The program is not divided into grade levels and the scores cannot be used for other children. Most of the material covered is stuff my kids already knew and they were very bored with what there was. There is basically no math, just one example of each problem, that's it. Don't waste your money or time on any of these products."
4,Beautiful footage,"I've watched two of the four DVDs in the set so far. I've really enjoyed the aerial views of CA, and the additional DVD of Arizona.Sound quality is excellent. Narration is informative. Watching is very relaxing, like being on a mini-vacation."
2,DVD for memories,I Lived in California for 3 years so wanted a good DVD to relive the area. I was disappoointed in the quality as I tried to play it on a 8 foot screen. The image was so bad that I probably will not watch all the DVDs.
3,Re: Pretty entertaining,"I first saw this movie while on the airplane to Taiwan. It captured my interest so much that I decided to buy it once I came back to the US. Overall, the movie is entertaining. It's certainly not the best film I've ever seen, however, it's a great comedy with some interesting plot turns. It should definitely hold your interest and give u a couple laughs too.Overall, without giving away too many of the plot twists, the plot revolves around Macy, played by Kelly Chen (the popular Cantonese singer), who becomes jilted at the altar. Over time, she discovers that she didn't know as much about the husband she was going to marry as she though. While making this discovery, she meets a variety of characters including Tony Leung, (In the Mood for Love)a private investigator. Love triangles etc. form along with some great and funny fighting scenes by Leung."
3,Chinese action film,"Although, some of the actions in this film is so out of touch, nevertheless, it is better than many other abundant Chinese action films."
4,So Far So Good,So far this product has performed greatly. It is just what we needed for docking and protecting our ski nautique. We've used them about 2 months now. The suction cups work very well and help us to get the bumpers right where we need them. They also do not take up a lot of space in the boat. I'm curious to see how well the product lasts... I'll update if there is any trouble with the durability.
3,Construction,Product is a great concept but on inspection I am sure that the cheap outer material will not last long and the plastic welding is rough and will probably damage the finish on my boat
2,Hull Huger,Made kind of cheap but they do the job. I like that they are flat and less likly to harm my boat when I bump the dock.
2,Artifacts in HD Video,"The packaging was satisfactory and product looked like a good quality cable, however when connected to a 26"" 720p display, the image had significant artifacts. I tested the cable both with and without a powered HDMI amplifier. The audio was okay, although i didn't try recreating surround sound. On a side note, I tried the cable on a different brand TV and did NOT experience the same image problem. It seems some TV's may be more sensitive to the inexpensive cable."
1,Broke After One Day!,"Bought this for my projector just the other day. Today it already wont keep a signal unless I posistion the end of the cord in a certain way, and that wont hold for long either. Very disappointed with product. Just bought the MediaBridge Ultra Series brand hoping for better results."
3,HDMI cable good,seems to be good quality cable abd is good signal carrier. The mength doesn't seem to affect signal with length
1,the connector covering broke,The connector covering came off on the first day of use and I could never use it. I will hesitate to buy stuff like this online as it is not worth going through the hassle of returning it for the price.
4,As advertised.,"The cable arrived promptly and works well. I do notice a little screen flicker on start-up but 50ft is pretty long for HDMI, after the initial flicker, the signal is clear. Great price!"
2,"Would be great, if it worked and lasted","Bought one of these about a year ago, it worked fine and then one day I got a lot of line noise in the picture, running at 1080p. Eventually 1080p stopped working and it only worked in 720p so I bought another this week. The one that came in the mail doesn't work @ 1080p at all... the 25ft cables I have work fine. Returning for a refund. Stinks to waste 30+ dollars in 1 year, if this worked and lasted it'd be perfect."
3,Ehh,"I bought this CD on a whim because I was recommended it by Amazon after buying a lot of alternative country. You know, stuff like Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt and other stuff that only great people like. Well....ehh. It's not horrible but it's not that great either. Some songs are good, some are not as good. That's pretty much how it goes down."
5,Great stuff,"I've been listening to this for years and am really glad to see it remastered. I've been waiting and checking. The old copy I have has been played to death. This is great straight through. The best alt country done by real southern folks. I think it makes a difference. Excellent lyrically and musically. Carrie Hudson's guitar playing is sweet, and powerful when need be. Incredible tone and taste. Lots of variety here too. I can't pick a standout song on this because they are all outstanding! Tunes that will stick in your head without being hook-laden. If you ever get a chance to see them live you are in for an unforgettable night. This album is a true classic!!! Even better with the remastering! Bonus tracks too."
1,There are better books out there.,"From start to finish this book presents a laundry list of the author's opinions, which are largely unsupported by facts. His arguments are poorly constructed and the book's basic grammar is likewise poor. Altogether, the effort makes one doubt whether the information presented is reliable enough for carry concealed. I'm sure there are much better concealed carry books available."
4,Which translation?,"There are many translations of Dante's Divine Comedy. So, which translation is being performed here by Heathcoate Williams? it's impossible to find out. I listened to a portion at the Naxos Spoken Word Library website, and I like the performance very much. The CD cover doesn't tell what Translation is being read, nor do the program notes tell us."
3,Solid read,One of the better entrys in this series. The ending is a bit too Hollywood but Mr. Reacher does pull off some awesome capers in this book.
5,Fun and interesting!,"This was my first Lee Child and I loved it. Reacher is a superb character who can kick anyone's butt, and thats the kind of stuff I love. Bring on the invincible heroes. This book was fun, fast, and Child has a smooth writing style that I found engaging. This is the first of many for me."
4,There's something about Lee Child's style,"I have read 4 or 5 of Lee Child's books so far and I can't help feeling that there's something different about his style. Something classier than that of his American counterparts, e.g., Baldachi and Vince Flynn. Would it be because he is English? Even in the violent scenes, he can deliver the same impact without leaving too much gross image in your mind. His storyline is typically very good. Then there's Jack Reacher - a character I've never seen before in any books or movies.About this particular book, the Hobie guy really pissed me off throughout the book. I was so mad at him that if Reacher didn't take care of him, I'd go to NYC to introduce a 9 mm or two to his brain myself. Beside that, I don't think this book is any better or worse than other books of his. Everybook has a different story and this time it's about what happened in the Vietnam war. You'd enjoy it."
5,Trip Wire,One of the best Reacher books! Good story line; some romance thrown in; and a really surprise twist at the end.
3,Why is this book so expensive-$89.00?,I have read just about all of Lee Child's books and am in the process of collecting the few I have not had the pleasure of reading. I want to purchase and read the 3rd book of the series but every time I locate a copy it is outrageously priced. And I am referring to the Audio book format because of my commuting and am not aware of the pricing for a paper version.Can anyone please tell me why this particular title is so expensive?
4,Exciting,As usual with Lee Child this is a really exciting action book. Lots happening and even a bit of romance. Great read for Jack Reacher lovers
2,Hit the road Jack,"Tripwire is the worst Jack Reacher novel I've read to date. I liked the other ones, though I haven't finished reading them all just yet. The plot sounded good when I bought the book, however this didn't turn out to be the case. Jack Reacher is a great character, so I was disappointed that Mr Child didn't use him to his full potential. Jack is best when out on the road moving from place to place and helping people, kind of like the Incredible Hulk."
2,"Some interesting premises, but too many errors...","I really enjoyed the first two Reacher books, but this one had far too many errors involving travel that got in the way. For example, Reacher frequently buys airline tickets with no identification--this is impossible today. All airlines require a picture ID when buying a ticket, and they would be especially suspicious of someone paying cash. Likewise, he travels business-class on domestic routes, but virtually no airline currently has business class sections on their domestic routes. Finally, he describes buying a first-class ticket and flying from Dallas to Honolulu. Coincidentally, I was in a first-class seat from Dallas to Honolulu as I read this section and, while it was certainly nice it was no where near as luxurious and spacious as it is described in the book. Perhaps the author just needs to do a bit more research next time."
2,I didn't get it,"I didn't get this book. I like thrillers where I can put myself in the protagonist's shoes, suffer with him through the book and eventually win with him/her (why not? I like happy endings). Being a normal guy, I find it easier to sympathize with the protagonist when he is an ordinary guy as well. Well Jack Reacher is no ordinary guy. Gigantically tall and mostruosly fit, he comes from nowhere and has no friends, nor family ties. Highly unreal. He is a tough guy who is not surprised to see people shooting at him for no apparent reason. in other words, he is a comic. And my problem is that I don't like comics. Even his relationship with Jodie - his former mentor's daughter - is so stereotypical....No, I didn't get this book, nor did i enjoy it. I gave it up after 280 pages with no regrets except for the price of the book. Shame, considering that it is not badly written after all."
4,Tripwire,"Everything was fine, a typical jack reacher thriller, except the print of the book was suprisingly small, thus difficult to read for older folks like myself."
1,A big disappointment.,"A big disappointment. I enjoyed the first two Jack Reacher stories but found Tripwire hard to finish. The plot was not believable. I know that it is necessary to suspend your disbelief somewhat to enjoy a thriller. But I found most of the book to be filler, just a means to get to the next violent scene.Two people wonder into various government offices across the U.S. and get treated like VIP's? Underlings are actually running to get information for these outsiders? It doesn't work that way when I need something from the Feds. Seems like 60 Minutes has stories on all the time describing how uncooperative these agencies are.The bad guys are too evil to be believable. But we are supposed to believe that the baddest guy in the whole wide world is put on hold by a rich housewife? He holds her captive for two or more days and nights, he fancies her, she is prancing around in next to nothing, and a guy who is so evil he tortures people to death for fun doesn't take advantage of her?"
2,Bad OCR Software for kindle version! does anyone proofread??,"The story was great. Typical Jack Reacher what I have come to expect from Lee Child. My poor rating isn't due to that but my annoyance at paying $8.99 for a digital product that once it is produced costs the publisher and Amazon essentially nothing and it seems that just about nothing is about what they put into producing in. It seems they just scanned the print copy of the book and used OCR software to change it into the Kindle format and then no one ever did a thorough proof read of it. I have never in my life read a published book with so many typos. Some of them occurred in the same words throughout the book such as ""corner"" would be ""comer"". Instead of ""I"" there would be the numeral ""1"". The list goes on and on. I don't think I made it through five pages without a typo, and it just annoyed me. This is a published book that I paid for! Amazon or whoever is responsible: Do better!"
2,Massive loose end totally ruined it,"I was enjoying this book (thoroughly) until I got to the denouement. The plot twist (which I won't reveal) left an impossible-to-fix plot hole relating to American dollars. Others have mentioned it here, so if you care to go and delve into the other reviews, you will find a discussion about this. Although even there, the point has been missed. If you read the book, and you're alert (and you don't have to be VERY alert!) you'll catch it. It made me livid. Had I been reading an actual physical book, rather than an electronic one, it would have been thrown across the room. Overall, I like Jack Reacher, this is the 2nd Child book I've read and I've been disappointed with both endings. I detest loose ends, I detest plot holes, they're just plain lazy. But I will persevere with the Reacher books and hope they improve."
4,Tripwire by Lee Child,"This Reacher novel (Tripwire) was typically good, but I didn't find myself reading and reading and reading. That is not to say the next person wouldn't thoroughly enjoy it. I've read most of the Reacher books, and I am not losing my interest at all, which is something that usually happens when I read many books by the same author."
3,Not Up to Reacher Quality,I have loved the prior 10-12 Reacher novels I have read to date but this one left a lot to be desired. The writing seemed predictable and this Reacher nowhere near as interesting as in the other novels.
4,Another great Reacher novel,Another great Reacher novel . . . nice beginning in Key West. I only wish author Childs would have stayed on the island a bit longer.
2,Tripwire,This book was not up to Lee Child`s usual. I was disappointed. I felt it didn`t answer all the questions. It left me wondering.
3,THE OTHER TWO WERE BETTER!!!!!,"This is my third Lee Child book, I think the other two were much better. Jack Reacher is again the hero. He is trying to find out what happend to Victor Hobie. Did he did die in Vietnam or not? If he did who is making all the bad things happen? Parts of the book were great and parts were very, very slow moving. In one place it took two pages to tell out Hobie went to bed. There were pages of airline travel to many different places. Most all the book is about the Stone family, Chester and Mayilyn but in the end nothing is said about what happened to them. They just are not there any more. Shame, shame Mr. Child. I found myself scanning several pages because they were just talk or thinking which did not amount to anything. I hope the next book is as good as the first two."
4,The Rambo of action books!,"Remember those t-shirts that said, 'I wish I was deep instead of just macho' ? Driven to investigate by his compassion for an elderly bereaved couple, Jack Reacher is gentlemanly enough to keep his hands right off his unrequited love, yet So Tough that bullets literally can't pierce his muscular chest.The author does the Vietnam Vet fatigue and jungle combat thing really well, with a wide variety of military goodies and baddies. Even more of an accomplishment for a UK author (I read him say somewhere that he set his books in the US to attract the widest audience - will US readers not read books set elsewhere?) It's predictable and a bit cartooney, but all the better for it - I enjoyed it, it's a fun, fast & exciting book."
1,A real page turner,"A real page turner...I couldn't flip through the pages fast enough to get it over with. Tripwire was my first introduction to Jack Reacher, and I don't think we will be getting to know each other better. The mystery wasn't very mysterious and the romance was dull, cliqued, and filled with sophomoric angst.The weak mystery is covered over with an overly complicated plot and hodgepodge of fluff characters. The two characters that hold any promise of being interesting, Tony and Marlin Stone, are either ignored or given up on in the last several chapters. The only real surprise comes in the end when we find out that Reacher is really Superman and his only weak spot is his head."
1,Could not finish book...,"One more mention of the skinny,blonde woman and I would have thrown the book across the room. So to keep from putting a hole in my wall, I did not finish the book. If as much time was spent on the plot as it was describing her scrawy arms and thin hair, it might have been a decent book. The worst Jack Reacher novel. Ever."
5,Tripwire is a Great Read,"Ever since I read ""Killing Floor"" by Lee Child I have been captivated by his books. This his 3rd book in the series may not be as good as the previous two, but is sill a very good read. Lee Child has a brilliant hero in Jack Reacher and I look forward to reading the rest of this fabulous series."
4,"Muscular Hero, Evil Villain","My second Jack Reacher novel. He is a muscular, straight-forward hero pitted against a truly nasty bad-guy. A fairly original plot, good action, and crisp dialogue moves the story along. I plan to keep reading Lee Child, the two books I've read are a cut above most of the action books on the market."
4,A very talented writer with deep thoughts and poetic style,"One of the most fantastic writers of the late 90s. I would put Mr. Child together with Michael Connelly and both are definitely better than Stephen Cannel. Both writers are with natural writing gift and not pretentious at all. What Child should be aware are: 1) find better editing people; 2) find a better publisher who could print his books with larger fonts; 3) be careful of the minor logic and tense flaws that seemed to be inevitable in all of his Jack Reacher series, and this one also got some: P.52 ""Costello FIND you down there?"" P.56 Even all the mourners left, the house should not just become empty, it should still with some catering people hanging around to clean up the dishes. It was unlikely that Jodie alone prepared all the food for the after-funeral meals. P.323 Tony did not go down to Key West bar looking for Jack Reacher."
2,Too descriptive,I wasn't fond of this book at all. It was boring for the most part and tremendously descriptive.The whole plot of Reacher's attraction for a 15 year old girl back when he was 24 was a little too much for me.
3,Just Okay,"Reacher's back with TRIPWIRE doing what Jack Reacher does best- getting even, which just means getting the bad guys out of the picture. This time it is a disturbed Vietnam vet with a Lee Child twist.The basic training information for the era was off- not 12 weeks at Fort Dix, NJ, followed by four at Fort Polk, LA. Then it was eight weeks Basic Training and eight weeks AIT (Advanced Infantry Training). Since it was Fort Polk that meant good ol' Tigerland. You had to have been there to understand. Still, all in all a halfway decent story.The drawback I'm finding is that Reacher is becoming much like the character of the old Don Pendleton series- The Executioner. He's taking on everybody as a one-man army, righting the wrongs of the world or the world that revolves around his past.A good effort but not Child's best."
3,Tripwire,"This was standard Jack Reacher, but nothing special. I flipped past many pages. Not the best in the Reacher series."
3,Easy read,This series is easy to follow along and even easier to get absorbed in... I completed this one on my iPad over a weekend.
4,book,The book was in good shape arrived in a timely manner. The book got my attention right away with the suspense. Its better than most of the mystery books that i have read.
4,Early Reacher,I prefer the later Reachers because the guy is just so hard core. But wondering what horrible deaths were waiting for the bad guys in this one kept me engaged!
4,Tripwire,Kept you in suspense the whole way through. You never knew until the end the outcome of the story.A typical Lee Child novel but with a few more surprises.
3,I'm really noticing a repetitious theme to these books!,It was okay but I wasn't as excited to get to the next page as some of his other books.
3,Too Much Filler,"Although a lot of the book held my interest, I found myself skipping through a lot of pages that described in detail the size of airline seats and information that just seemed to be there to add enough words to make it a novel."
4,Same Formula Different Book,"If you have read any of the other Reacher novels you know exactly what to expect. Reacher is the ultimate embodiment of the lone-hero archetype. He is nearly super human in strength. He gets pulled in to a situation completely by fate, and in the end must destroy a character that is evil beyond human comprehension. There is also the obligatory female character that he feels a strong affinity towards. This of course leads to super human stamina in the bedroom. Nothing graphic of course, everything is tastefully implied.Yet with all of that said, this is one of the better Reacher novels. The plot is paced nicely. Reacher's skills of deduction seem human instead of super-human. There is a believable tension between Reacher and the female character. It isn't the sudden lust seen in most of the novels. It carries a good plot and pace for an action/thriller plus shows Reacher at his most human emotionally."
2,very weak early effort,I would say it is the lowest so far point in the series. Almost everything makes no sense at all. The only value of this book is being a part in a very good series.
4,Trip Wire,I just started this book and it has hold on me already. I like Lee Child's books because they are very absorbing and unpredictable. (What's the use of reading a book if you can figure it out yourself from the beginning/)
2,Glad it was a library rental and not a purchase,"I love Lee Child, but this was not a good book to read. It was long winded, the villains were over the top cliched to the point it was laughable. If he wasn't a normally excellent writer, I would have never picked up another Reacher novel. Glad I stuck with him, as he redeems himself in the books to come. Hang in there, fans. It gets better."
4,Classic Jack Reacher,"Pretty standard Jack Reacher - easy to read, very consumerable. After spending all day looking after the kids, I'm not looking for something high brow and intellectual. Jack Reacher hits the spot!"
4,Love Jack Reacher!,Another great Jack Reacher book. I like that Jack has a love interest in this book and hopefully she or he will stick around. Keep up the good work Lee Child.
4,Lee Child Did It Again,Lee Child gets you hooked on the storyline and makes you want to keep reading until you find all the answers. Enjoyed the book.
4,A very good read classic Jack Reacher,This is a classic Jack reacher read that keeps the pace almost all the way through. I personally thought the end dragged a bit and actually skipped a few pages with no real harm to the overall experience. Still recommend it for anyone who likes his thrillers fast paced and tough.
4,Tripwire,Looking for an action packed read? This Jack Reacher novel doesn't disappoint. It will keep the reader on the edge of their seat until the very end.
4,Enjoyable,"An entertaining book that holds the readers interest throughout the story. Plenty of twists and turns, the author keeps you guessing.If you enjoy mysteries this is a good one."
5,Another Reacher worth reading.,"Good to the last pages as usual lee Child at his best as always. Blood, guts, nuts, and chicken feathers."
4,better than the last two,Im trying really hard to get into this caracter the first two books were slow and a little bit unbeleiveable this book is a little better the action is early on plot is believeable I love the caracter so I gave it four stars!
1,too descriptive,"Lee Child has a great idea for a character and plot but continues to describe rooms, scenes, thoughts, etc to the extreme. This book as well as his other Jack Reacher series could be 100 pages less than they are if he would just get to the point. No one wants to read 4 or 5 pages worth of colors, height, width, depth of a painting Reacher is looking at."
3,Average; But it's still Jack Reacher!,"The book starts off well, in classic Lee Child fashion. Reacher is a drifter in Key West until a P.I. finds him. Reacher denies who he is when asked, but then the P.I. turns up murdered. Traveling back to New York to find out who hired the P.I., he meets up with someone from his past--the daughter of his mentor. The love story and action are intense, but the story of a missing-in-action Vietnam soldier, Victor Hobie, isn't very compelling. With a good plot twist at the end, Child almost redeems himself. Not the best work, but it's still a Reacher thriller!"
2,Child missed on this one.,"Having read KILLING FLOOR and DIE TRYING, I eagerly picked up a copy of TRIPWIRE. It is easily the weakest of the three. The villian, Hook Hobie, is like something out of a Marvel Comic book. Every time a character meets him, Child describes him all over again in the same terms, from the half burned face, to the J shaped hook where his hand should be.Reacher's relationship with Jodie seems rather strange. Especially when Reacher admits to being attracted to her when she was a child, it sounds downright creepy. I was,however, glad to see him ready to give up his paranoid, wandering lifestyle.The plot was barely interesting and any avid reader of mystery thrillers will figure it out long before Child tells us. I was glad that I picked this book up from the library. I would have felt cheated if I actually paid for it. I hope this isn't the beginning of the end for Mr. Child."
3,Child puts you in a character's head like no other author.,"Tripwire is my least favorite of Mr. Child's four novels. Having said that, Child on a bad day is better than most writers on their best day. My 3-star rating is relation to his other 5-star books. I actually listened to this book on unabridged audio. Mr. Dick Hill does a marvelous job as he did on the prior three books. I found the violence in this one a bit gratuitous. The bad guy stretches the bounds of evil and credibility, but on the whole, the novel works. On audio, Mr. Child's constant use of ""right?"" in dialog tends to annoy. If you've not read Mr. Child before, start with his other books."
2,Disappointing so far,"This Reacher novel is somewhat overwritten. Too much unnecesary writing, too many romantic interludes. I find I'm skipping about 60% of the pages. Also, the terse writing style is beginning to wear thin.The smarts and snappy dialogue are still there, with one exception - his pontificating on the Vietnam War. For some reason, rather than his normal informed and independent opinion, he simply regurgitates popular myths - the wrong war, the wrong time, etc. Hey, Reacher, tell that to the millions who were killed by the Communists when America pulled out. Funny, because in another book, he gets upset about people hunting *animals*. Other Hollywood facts he trots out: soldiers paying for souvenir ears and shrunken heads, and so on.There's an interesting parallel track where a smart woman tries to con her (and her husband's) way out of an awful situation. Then pages of kissy-talk between Reacher and a long-lost sweetheart. Overall, not the best Reacher novel."
3,Not compelling enough to read again,"I nice yarn with lovely areas of suspense. But a little to ""American"" for me. If you are after a simple thriller this is for you."
4,Child delivers Again,"Third in the Jack Reacher series. I really enjoyed this addition, I learned more about Jack Reacher's background and history. Jack, again, gets involved with a beautiful woman, from his past, to determine what happened to a MIA from the Vietnam war. Excellent read ! Suggest you start in the beginning of the series with the Killing Floor."
1,This is my worst buy of the year.,Page after page of descriptive detail that has little to do with a plot that is not plausible and characters that are completely unreal.
5,another great Jack Reacher,"recommend this product to all who have finished the WEB Griffin series as I have. Not as many players to remember throughout the years. Just Jack and Joe(RIP) The movie Jack Reacher was great but Tom Cruise portraying a 6' 5"" 255lb. guy? In my opinion did a hell of a job!! The end of the movie ended great"
3,Not my favorite,"I enjoy Jack Reacher, but this one dragged on for me. I will read the next one soon! Others I know, say this one was a favorite."
4,"A good book, but still a notch below Killing Floor","I literally just finished reading Tripwire, and it was a good book, easily up there with Lee Child's other Jack Reacher books, but still not quite as ""oh my god"" awesome as Killing Floor. The villian this time was (without giving anything away) a fairly common type of character, whose true nature I saw coming well in advance of the final couple of chapters. Even so, this was a good novel, but not quite the ""can't put it down to go to sleep"" type of read that Killing Floor was. Maybe Lee Child will be like William Gibson, in that everything he writes after his first novel will be damn good, but just never able to measure up to that first work. That said, I'll still keep buying everything the guy writes."
1,To unbelieveable to enjoy,"I liked the first two in the Jack Reacher series, especially the first one, but this will be the last I will read. Trying to avoid spoilers here: For no reason he visits a horticultural exhibit (no previous interest has ever been shown, and no explaination as to why he would go there) and because of that he solves one of the pivotal puzzles in the story. This is just one example of the many unbelievable situations that the book revolves around. If I want fantasy I will read D&D fanzines. There are too many books with well thought out plots and solutions to waste time reading poorly written novels such as this."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.,"I had to read a book by Lee Child as i had heard a lot about him.But i am very sorry to say that i picked a book which will perhaps not make me very keen to read a Lee Child book again so fast.The book had lengthy details about almost everything which was not necessary and could have been avoided.It sort of killed the thrill in the book.I am sure it could have been a very good book as the main outline of the story is very good, also it has a very sinister villian which will shock the living daylights out of you.Read this one only if you are a loyal fan of Child."
1,Lacking Suspense,"I had to force myself to finish this book. The cheapskate side of me did not want to throw money down the drain. There was a profound lack of intrigue and suspense for a ""suspense thriller."" The characters lacked depth and were very one dimensional. The antagonist of the story has a hook--I find this to be very comical. Jack Reacher is a character without any real human flaws--every pseudo flaw the author tries to introduce is quickly rationalized or explained into niceness--thus loosing the attempted effect. Practicaly every other chapter described how big and manly Jack is and how small, and petite his lady partner is. This is a ""Harlequin"" style story for men. The story did not inspire me to care about what happens to any of the characters--which is critical in a suspense novel."
4,Tripwire,This book was very entertaining to read as it was fast paced and with excellent twits and turns in the plot. Get me interested from the beginning to the end.Will be reading the rest of the Reacher series over time.
3,Testosterone and Suspense,"As always, Child writes a testosterone and suspense filled book, a great guilty pleasure. After reading a couple of the latter books in this series I am working my way through the books in order."
5,Series Ratchets Up a Notch,Talk about being late to the party...I've only recently waded into the Reacher series and TRIPWIRE definitely supersedes the first two titles. It features a pair of very intriguing female characters (Jodie and Marilyn) and a deliciously over-the-top villain (Hook Hobie). Reacher grows before our eyes in this extraordinarily personal story.The plot sizzles and TRIPWIRE is impossible to put down. 5 stars.
4,"Great Bad Guy, ending wasn't great","If you are new to the series Jack Reacher is a former Army MP, part Rambo and part Columbo, who wants nothing more than to travel around the country. Through plausible plot setups, Reacher finds himself in a position to help.What I loved most about this book is the Bad guy, Hook Hobbie. Hook is easy to dislike and an extremely formidable adversary for Jack Reacher. This book you start to see Jack more of the investigator and a little less of the ass kicker, although he still does knock a few heads in this book.What I did not like about this book was the ""jet setting"" that Jack had to do to find some of the key information. It seemed to me, that he could have picked up a phone and saved himself a few days worth of travel. I loved his adversary, but found myself only liking the book. The ending seemed a tad too super human, even for Jack Reacher."
3,Avenging a War Crime,"Like many, I am going back and now reading the entire Jack Reacher series. This third entry's story was interesting as it stretches back to the Vietnam War. The novel has two plot lines that take time to come together with the Reacher plot line somewhat ho-hum. The other one introduces a loathsome villain who is more engaging than Reacher. I recently read Lost Soldiers by James Webb which was interesting as both books deal with the repatriation of soldier's remains from Vietnam. Reacher is a little neutered and somewhat domesticated in this outing. Still he remains a potent lead character and Child has created a fun formula."
3,"A good read, but could have been trimmed","I'm reading Child's books in sequence, so this was my third Reacher novel. It held my attention. I enjoy Child's writing and the action sequences with Reacher. I usually just skim over Child's details about military procedures (there are two chapters dedicated to describing a military procedure, with a line or so at the end that advances the plot) or the specifics of firearms. I found the romantic subplot to be creepy, so I ended up skimming that, too.I usually enjoy Reacher's incredulous adventures. But his expedition for finding a gun and a later incident with a bullet were just too much.The ending was odd. I kept turning the blank pages at the end, expecting an epilogue.I gave it three stars because I enjoyed it overall. I have my criticisms, but all is forgiven. I'm on my fourth Child book now."
2,Jack Reacher is boring--book TOO long and goes TOO slow!,I am on the second book and am tired of everyone SHRUGGING!I can't imagine little Tom Cruiseplaying Jack Reacher in a movie.Reacher is at least a foot tallerthan Cruise. Little Tom has babysized muscles too!
3,Not bad,Inline with other Reacher books. Lazy sometimes and to much love story. Will keep reading. Hate to say it but the movie was better.
2,Unsatisfying,The romantic interest and the prospect of seeing Reacher decide to settle down are slight positives that are more than offset by the incredibly one-dimensional villain and wholly unsatisfying resolution.
2,He-man defeats the Hook,"Jack Reacher is an all American hero. 6ft 5 tall, 250 pounds of muscle, impervious to bullets, untouchable for knives, irresistible to women and a brilliant investigator to boot. Extremely annoying. His opponent in this book is a caricature villain, an older, disfigured, disabled man with a hook for a hand, dripping with malice. So naturally I was rooting for the villain. Eventually he gets a chance to finish off the lumbering hero and his annoyingly perfect girlfriend but guess what? Reacher cleverly turns the tables on him. I was so disappointed."
4,good travel read,"Full of action, as a typical Jack Reacher novel. Good page turner. I would recommend for travel reading or to pass the time."
5,Another great Reacher book,"Tripwire is probably one of his top three books in my opinion, good plot, hateful bad guy, lots of action and intrigue, and the usual things Childs does in the Reacher series. If you like the Reacher books, you have already read it; if not, read it anyway. I am not biased, just enlightened (yeh, right, and I have a halo over my head too). Seriously, treat yourself to a good book for a rainy day."
3,Strained Reacher,"Another typical Reacher with lots of action, love interest, evil and adventure. This one, however, lacks credibility to an even greater extent than most of the other Reachers. For example, two NYPD officers (from a radio car) lose their lives because they go on an investigation without notifying dispatch of where they are or what case they're working on. Because of this, I found that I ran out of willing suspension of disbelief. I'd skip this one or maybe read it if you've read all the others at least once."
3,Trip wire,A good read but I don't feel it was as good as others in the series. I will continue with the series.
4,Tripwire,Another good Jack Reacher story. I'm definelty a Reacher fan. I like his no holds barred attitude.I definetly like his kick ass way of handling situations.
5,Review of Tripwire,One of the most exiciting books that I have read and I have read hundreds of books. I have to fight the urge to read the last chapter just to see how it turned out.
3,Expected more from the ending.,"SPOILER ALERTThe villain has a nasty, deadly hook and face full of numb scar tissue. The perfect opponent for Reacher to brawl with bear handed. I could picture the hook gouging trenches across Reacher's arms and chest. Reacher's fist landing with a deadening thud against Allen's grotesque face. I was hoping for a grudge-match, instead we get a stereotypical standoff with the love interest as a human shield. Just boring.The rest of the book was great, maybe a little too much filler here and there but very good. Still a thriller."
2,"Good Story, but editing is terrible.","This is the trird Reacher book I have read. The story is okay sometimes it can be predictable like most works of fiction. However I am finding it increasingly difficult to get past the horrible editing. It is not only found in this book, but also in the 2 previous ones as well. One of the best examples of this is:""He carefully shaved from his collarbone to his chin.""Okay, we all know that they probably meant cheekbone to his chin, but it is just the point of it being so obvious that it is horrible. I am definitely not a literature and grammatical scholar so if I am able to find problems like this then it is pretty bad.I would recommend reading it, but be prepared to feel like a 3rd grade teacher finding logic and grammer issues throughout the book."
3,Not the Best of Child,"This was not Lee Child's best jack Reacher novel. When I finished it, I was still thinking it would have a big finnally. Not this time."
3,"The forensics got kinda dragged out, even I lost track of all the bones and bodies","Reacher seemed almost subdued (bewitched?) in this one, due to meeting up with Jodie...I found myself envisioning her as well, and Hobie (Allen) was as grotesque as intended.But still, I found it dragged a bit, just as their multiple flights did, and as such, I'm not sure this one would play well to a screenplay."
3,One of the good ones,"Lee Child writes to a formula, so most ofhis Jack Reacher books include an intelligentbeautiful woman who he works with and bedsafter a nice hot shower, found guns, bad guysusually 5 at a time to beat up and systematicallydispose of, and the bad Kingpin behind the sceneswho finally gets his come-uppance.His wonderful way with minutiae, you know, the boringdetails is captivating at first but eventually starts to gagin the brain. The man certainly is a talented writer,to be able to spin out the same story over 17 odd booksis commendable. Trip wire is a page turner if it is one ofthe first of his you read, I have read 5, the story is gettingtoo samey. time to move on."
2,Not good,"I enjoyed the first two Reacher novels, but this one misses the mark. Waaaay to much dedicated to Reacher's surroundings...his hotel rooms, his seat on the airplane, the car he's driving. I'll bet a quarter of the 400-plus page novel is dedicated to this stuff. And Reacher's whiny self pity party is just laughably out of character. I get the desire to give the character some complexity. Still, having him wallow in Oh Poor Me was just lame.Gonna have to take a break from the Reacher series for a while. Hoping Lee Child rediscovered his form I later books."
4,Tripwire,"I have read several of Lee's books. He has a very good formula, and I find his style and content very entertaining. I believe it is a shame that Tom Cruise was cast as Jack in the new movie entitled Jack Reacher. Lee has gone to great effort to build the character as a large, muscular man who is not partucularly physically attractive, but very fit, and intelligent. Tom Cruise simply does not sell as this character. I think the casting director of the movie should be fired."
3,It's ok,"This book was great in some spots, but was predictable in who the villain is. Not sure I want to read anymore Reacher books because they are very formulated."
3,"Good story, but","I enjoyed the first two books, but they seem to have a great deal of violence. I was waiting for Reacher to grow a bit. Perhaps he will grow in his new life in the future. He has many talents and is a very gifted individual, and those talents need to be explored in more situations than those that end in extreme violence. I am taking a break from reading books about Reacher and will probably purchase one in the future, but I need to read some books that don't contain as much violence at the present."
3,Interesting MIA-based mystery with historical Vietnam War links.,"Unfortunately, I solved the mystery one-third of the way through and so the rest of the novel unraveled rather slowly for me. Again, his writing style is tedious and overscripted. I couldn't believe that in the middle of his climax scene, he gives us three pages of backstory. The history of the Vietnam War's MIAs was the most interesting part.--author Donna Del Oro"
4,Hack job but a fun read,You don't read a Child novel to experience great pros or a classic novel of immense proportions. You read Child to escape into a simple world with easy to understand characters and easy to follow plot lines with enough twists and enough heroics to make you turn the page. Such is the case with Jack Reacher who finds himself embroiled in another messy situation with Captain Hook for a villain and the standard love interest that is also smart and sassy. I had immense fun reading the novel and burying my worries inside of this work of fiction. Yes there are sentence fragments all over the place and yes some of the dialog needed a rewrite but after all Child is there to entertain.My one pet peeve would be to abandon two major characters -- the stone family. That's part of the problem of throwing this together in a hurry. It's sloppy on Child's part even though we can predict what would happen to them. This is airport reading material and nothing more but it's still a great ride.
3,Big Change--Not a Good Ending.,I am reading the Jack Reacher series in order. This is the third I have read and this is weakest. Lee Child writes a great story and this moves well but it lacks in suspense and there is no real ending. I wonder if in writing this Child was wondering whether to end the series. As one reviewer says there is no explanation of any of the parts of the story. For example it is hard to understand why Hobes stayed around. We do not know what happens to the Stones.
4,Very good.,"A suspenseful mystery novel, Child teases the reader with up to three parallel stories, all waiting to make a huge collision at the incredible ending. Reading it, one can see how Child gradually changes his own writing style, a sign of fantastic versatility. He develops characters as easily as any writer and gives background as well as Crichton. Descriptive yet not too dragged out, the book lures the reader in. A sure read!"
3,A thriller with a hook!,"This is the first Jack Reacher novel I have read, but I plan on checking out the rest since he is an interesting character - loner, drifter, retired MP. In this novel he is drawn into a 30 year-old mystery by a former commanding officer. There is one especially nasty character who's disfigured by fire and has a hooked arm. He is running some scams for high dollars and does not want his real identity known. In the end he is foiled by Reacher."
1,Early and implausible,"Besides the many implausible events, stopping a bullet with iron hard pecs, buying a plane ticket sans id, for cash and getting all sorts of info from Army files tout suite, etc., there are major factual errors - a confusion of viet cong with montagnards and the absolute total incorrectness of how body identifications are made at the Army Central Identification Lab, Hawaii being the most egregious."
4,My hero!,"Jack Reacher, though seriously flawed, is fun to watch punishing the ""bad guys"".Lee Childs' books are a nice departure from the real world of the ACLU and the liberal media causes."
3,Trip Wire by Lee Child,"Ilove all of Lee Child's books. This one isn't as good as his first, but still worth reading."
5,AWESOME PLAYMAT,"My Baby loves this playmat!!!!!it keeps her busy for a good hour. (that the longest I let her play,The hanging toys keep her busy and I can tell that she is visually stimulated. She also has a great time batting away at the hanging ojests. I also use it for tummy time. She is well stimulated and it keeps her attention as well. If you are looking for a great baby product this is it!"
3,Lion Around Activity Mat Falls Down,"This mat is colorful and has multiple educational purposes. However, the problem with this is the arch bar will fall down or be pulled down very soon by your child. Allie is 6 months old and can pull down the arch with ease which I belive is unsafe."
4,"Great mat, but toys seems a bit unfriendly",My son seems to like his mat. He's still young and not yet super active. I am pretty disappointed that the dangling toys don't seem more baby friendly. They are hard plastic (except the mirror). I find it hard to believe that my son will want to reach for them when they aren't fun to touch. We both like the bright colors and the mat is fun. I hope I can find some friendlier toys to hook to it.
3,Not so good,"I recently bought this item for my 2 month old dd. I loved the bright colors and thought she would enjoy looking at the toys. Well, the bar is really unstable and it will fall forward or backwards the more active she gets. I would recommend spending money on a different mat!"
3,Very Cute & Colorful but not very durable!!!,"I received this for my son as a shower gift, and though it is awfully cute and very very colorful it won't stay up. He pulls at the toys like he is supposed to and guess what? The toy bar falls over. Since they are not soft toys he's not so happy when they land on his face. I would choose a different one with a sturdier arch!"
1,it sucks,"not sure why this was even released...the sound quality is total crap and the new studio songs suck. the live tracks dont offer anything other than a muffled version of the real thing...instead of buying this album, put 'point blank' on really, really loud, and plug your ears. sounds the same."
5,Good source for spiritual elements of madness,"As the author of one of the chapters in this book, I recommend the other essays chosen by editor Phil Barker. Lots of good information here about spirituality, empowerment, and recovery."
2,Falls Off,"I don't like this cover because it falls off of whatever you've clipped it to, and the case also falls off of the phone very easily."
1,black heart procession makes a man mean,this band is really bad. they do use somewhat 'obscure' instruments though so i suppose they must be good. a bit better than that three mile pilot thing though. don't remember vocals in ay black heart procession stuff and that three mile pilot singer doesn't really do anything but moan and groan about how sad any lonely life is. all this music is nothing but a widely distributed personal ad by those who just don't get why noone likes them even though they know the names of underground artists and like to cry.
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"Buyer Beware! If you have a Windows 2000 operating system on your PC, or the latest operating system for Macintosh, this little gem will not work on your machine.When asked about this problem, the manufacturer of said, ""it's not designed to work on the current operating systems.""I asked them if they intended to upgrade the software and they said, ""I don't think so, but then again, technicians are always the last ones to know.""Wrong, it is we, the consumers, who are the last ones to know. We find out AFTER we have bought the product and try to use it.Writing Tutor may once have been a good idea and a good piece of software, but if it was as good as they say it was its manufacturers should continue to support it.As it stands today, the software is pretty much useless."
2,You get what you pay for!,Not even worth the [money]! The typing section of the program may be better. The writing tutor - the level of analysis is very low. It doesn't catch a number of common errors.
1,Buyer Beware -- You Better Believe It!!!,"This programme is really awful. It states that it is suitable for ""any"" type of writers, but it is really only suitable for elementary school aged children, and even that group would not find this programme very enticing -- I know, because I teach elementary school. I am angry because of their advertising rhetoric, and like the previous reviewer stated, although it worked, it is way behind the times in technologically. Like my kids would say, ""This programme [is bad]!"""
2,"Cute, but not very useful.","This program has several cute features (though nowhere near the 50 they claim) but each works out rather like a ""demo mode"" of shareware. There are a few limited examples in each module, not a full list of features. It takes a lot of work to try to make the program at all useful, and to be blunt, it takes most of the creativity out of writing, rather than sparking your creativity. Most of the exercises reminded me either of a second grade ""storyboard"" activity or a sixth grade story prompt. None of the exercises are helpful in developing a real idea that you already have into an actual story or article.I will say this, though: it would be fun to use for a week or two in an elementary school classroom."
5,Bathtime Baby Doll,"I purchased this baby doll for my niece for Christmas, so I haven't given it to her yet, but I know she will just love it."
2,"Basic Beat Pair of 12"" Combination Rhythm Sticks",Sticks are not thick enough to make good tone when hit together.The grooves arent deep enough or spread apart enough to make a good guiro sound.
4,He Loves me..Or does he?,"Sixteen year old Alison isn't a professional pianist yet-but she's pretty darn close to it. But even though having a talent for music is fun, there's one more thing Alison would love to have: a guy who loves her.In this romantic story, Alison plays piano/keyboard with a band for weddings, parties and the like. While performing at an engagemeant party, Alison meets Ted, a seventeen year old reporter for the local paper. Alison and Ted hit it off pretty well and exchange numbers. But everytime she calls him, he's out and vice versa. And sometimes when they do talk, it seems more like Ted is interviewing Alison as a subject, rather than trying to get to know her better as a girl. Does he even care about her? And more importantly: Can they stay devoted to their passions and still fall in love?One of Caroline B. Cooney's early works-a good, fun romantic read."
2,Not so great,"This book is very slow and the characters are somewhat drab and predictable. Every author is allowed to have one average book and this is Montgomery's. I had a terrible time trying to finish it. It is well written, as is accustomed with LM Montgomery, but it lacks her usual spark. If you are looking for a novel practically perfect in every way try The Blue Castle--it is a far better romance. You can skip this aspect of Montgomery's collection easily and not miss much."
2,Not so great,"I've read the majority of LMM's books, and have liked to loved most of them. This is the only one that I've really found to be a disappointment. I agree with many of the other reviewers; the characters were flat, the ending was too predictable, and the book itself was overly sugary. It wasn't a horrid book, because LMM is too good of an author to write a horrid book, but it definitely wasn't good. I would steer away from this one if I were you (and I agree with one of the other reviewers; if you're looking for some good LMM, try ""The Blue Castle"")."
1,Ho-hum,"I should have trusted the mediocre reviews of this book. L.M. Montgomery's books are usually full of vibrant characters, action, and life. Kilmeny of the Orchard was flat, boring, and unbelievable. The only character who HAD a character was the villain.Bottom line - don't waste your time and money."
3,Interesting,"Very good language/description but one can get a bit tired of perfect, poetic beauty and ethereality by the end. The plot is even less probable than usual for Montgomery. Worth reading because it is very well written but not one of Montgomery's best."
3,Kilmeny,"I have read this book and I have to say that it is not a bad book, but nor is it the kind of book you read once and have to read again. It is the story of Eric Marshall and his love -- even though she's dumb -- Kilmeny Gordon. The name ""Kilmeny"" I had never heard before, and when I read the book, I felt that the name went only too well with the myseterious heroine. Kilmeny herself I found a fasinating person, though Eric to me seemed rather boring. My favorite characters would be Aunt Janet and Uncle Thomas Gordon, and the two Williamsons with their ""Timothy"". Neil Gordon, the villian, put all the action and suspense into the novel, and it's a little lame how he simply jumped town at the end. This story is a lot like a fairy tale romance, and perhaps Lucy Maud Montgomery meant it to be. ""Kilmeny of the Orchards"" is certainly NOT Montgomery's best work, but it still is worth a read."
4,Ennoyable read,"While this didn't pique my interest as much as Anne of Green Gables or the Blue Castle, this is a solid read, and a great short story by Ms. Montgomery. If you've enjoyed her series and stand-alone books, then you will definitely enjoy this. It's a nice, short (not overly so) love story between what seems like an unlikely couple :)"
2,Unusual POV for Lucy Maud Montgomery,"Kilmeny of the Orchard is unusual in that it is written from a young man's pov. Lucy Maud wrote a light hearted romance without any memorable characters. So different for her. However, I am a staunch fan and would gladly read anything the dear lady wrote."
2,The most boring of Montgomery's books...,"I love many of L.M. Montgomery's books, but this is the first time I've read one that I really didn't like. The plot was entirely predictable, the writing lifeless, the lead characters insipid. Blah. I think I'll go wash my mind out with some Anne, Emily or Valancy."
4,"Sweet love story, only two complaints","The love story between Eric Marshall and Kilmeny Gordon is part Victorian romance, part fairy tale. The characters are by turn sweet, noble and funny. The climax is dramatic, with a ""love conquers all"" - even muteness - theme.My first complaint is the emphasis on hereditary. It's a Victorian theory that good character and bad character are passed down through the genes. It's a weak link in the story.My second complaint is with the character of Neil. Montgomery's depiction of him is not only xenophobic and stereotypical, but an outright slur at Italians. He could have been a villain without the ethnic slurs and stereotypes."
5,Forgotten Treasure,This is an amazing book. It is a forgotten treasure of Montomery's work. I highly recommend it to all readers. You'll be glad you read it.
4,beautiful story,this book is thourghly enjoyable. though i did lots of research before i got it i still enjoyed each page. my favorite character is kilmeny. she has such a pure heart.
1,Horrible DO NOT BUY!,Well I love Rice Crackers but this is horrible they dont have any flavor I bought two case of 12 and now I dont know what to do with them. Its sad they would be good if they had more ORIGINAL flavors from Japan and Korean but I guess that was to much to ask. Will never buy these again. I will try to find some with ORIGNAL flavors.
5,Bravo for Shaft!,"Shaft does it again! He brings his street sense to Africa and woos an African princess in the process...and right under the watchful eye of her bodyguard! Too smooth! I was actually craving for more after this one...who knows, he might have done the same in Europe had more had been produced! Richard Roundtree was truly one of the hottest names in the business at that time as John Shaft. Get the other two as well to complete the collection (""Shaft"" and ""Shaft's Big Score"")."
3,A CHANGE OF PACE FOR SHAFT,"THIS TIME, JOHN SHAFT [RICHARD ROUNDTREE] IS FORCED TO GO TO AFRICA TO INFILTRATE A 20TH CENTURY SLAVE CARTEL. I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT THEY TRYED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH THE SERIES. THOUGH IT STILL PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE ORIGINAL, IT'S STILL A DECENT ACTION FILM."
4,Worth it for one line,"Shaft is discussing an impending female circumcision with the African princess and suggests ""We put a little wear and tear on that thing before they cut it off"". SMOOOOVE"
5,Shaft is still the man!,"Probably the best of the sequels, but not as good as the original Shaft. This film, which takes our hero to ""The Motherland"", and across Europe, to break up a slavery ring, has some great fight scenes, and a great ""Shaft girl."" This movie also boasts a great title song sung by the Four Tops! Great movie, lots of fun, and perfect for fans of the Shaft films, and the whole Black Cinema genre. Definetly worth a look."
1,"DON'T MAKE ME CRY, HATED IT REALLY I DID.","I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN. THEY ARE TOTAL LIARS. AND THEY SENT ME A GARBAGE DVD. WOW I HATE THIS COMPANY A LOT, SO PEOPLE BE AWARE, OKAY. AMAZON YOUR NEED TO DROP THEM FOREVER IN LIFE."
5,See This Movie:You'll Never see its likes again (!!!),"When I first started at University, Susannah York was guestlecturering there on feminism and womens rights.After seeing her in this movie, I could not walk past her posteron campus without laughing my head off.See this movie.If you live to be 300 you will never see anythinglike it.THEY WILL NEVER ALLOW ANYTHING LIKE IT TO BE MADE AGAIN(!!!).The hypocracy it displays is self explanitory,As is the Joke(!!!).GREAT GREAT FUN???YOU WILL LAUGH TILL YOU DROP(!!!)."
4,Prompt arrival,"An odd film, with a strong history, soon to be on the stage again, with Kathleen Turner. The stage version will begin at Long Wharf, New Haven, CT."
5,Enjoy =),"I watched ""Late Night Shopping"" one night, then put it on the next night, and the next. Ridiculous plot lines and endearing characters make for quite a funny film. I love the idea that you could be living with someone and never see them. I love the questions posed (which happen to be quite pertinent to twenty-somethings, or anyone working a dead-end job): ""And then what?"" ""So, what now?"" Well, if you don't know the answer to those questions, you can at least put on this film and have a laugh. Highly recommended. Enjoy."
1,"do not buy this product, total rip off","I totally forgot to review this awful purchase! It said it was a special edition - see that cover picture? I bought it for my boyfriend, who had the movie but not the special edition. The ""special edition"" cost significantly more than the regular edition, might I add. Well I got it in the mail, compared the two dvd's, and they were exactly the same. The cover was even like the regular edition, which is not the picture you see attached to this product on Amazon.Anyhow, I contacted the seller, who asked that I return the dvd for a refund (I also don't think I ever got that refund, but enough time passed where I just figured lesson learned, buyer beware, never again), but they did not reimburse me for shipping and made me pay for shipping it back.Again - BUYER BEWARE"
3,Dr Martens boot review,Price was amazing but shoes were not true to Dr Martens comfort and size. The shoes were uncomfortable and a larger size than any of the other Dr Martens that I own. I guess some deals are too good to be true.
1,A European history atlas in disguise....,"This atlas represents editorial laziness at its best. Instead of actually giving us a world history atlas, the editors have resurrected an older, narrowly-focused work. It's decent, to be sure, and I used it when I went to college, back in Stone Age (well, almost). It's still largely focused on the history of Europe, and I would use it in European history courses, but it doesn't serve us well if we need to teach world history. Try again, folks; just a little bit of effort now...."
2,Missing Pieces,"Received this very quickly after ordering it, however, it was missing 3 pieces. I contacted the vendor and offered to send a pic of what I received showing the 3 empty positions for the other parts, but no reply.Poor quality control, poor communication."
4,A FINE COLLECTION OF CREEPY HAUNTED HOUSE STORIES...,"Ms. Lofts is a best selling author of romantic suspense and well-written historical fiction. In a preamble to this book, Ms. Lofts declares that she is a devotee of ghost stories and houses. This book is her manifestation of that interest. Ms. Lofts expertly melds her two passions, creating a crisp collection of creepy short stories with a haunted house theme that will keep the reader turning the pages. Well-written and often chilling, they are certainly worth reading."
1,Re: Nikon EN- EL5 Battery,"Battery does not work - worst Nikon battery I've ever had if it is a ""genuine"" Nikon. Put in camera - showed it was dead. I charged it fully. When I turned camera on I took 2 pictures - viewed them & it was dead again. Tried to charge again & it simply will not work."
2,"Not a ""Nikon"" battery","The ad picture, as well as the original battery that came with my Nikon camera, has ""Nikon"" stamped on it. The battery that I recieved did not. It's not a ""genuine"" Nikon battery as advertised. This battery lasts about half as long as the original Nikon battery than came with my camera. It is better than the $7 one I got before it, which completely died in no time. I would have paid the money (about $45) for an original. But, it'll surfice for a backup."
1,It is an original but does not fit its brand,"I bought this item specifically because it is a Nikon EN-EL5. I have one that came with my Coolpix and it is still in good shape but I needed one extra for my trips. Unfortunately, I recharged it, didn't take much time and the recharger - that came with my Coolpix - showed that the battery was fully charged. When I put it in the camera and tried to zoom in, next thing the screen shows that 'Battery exhausted"". I plug it again in the charger, didn't take much - 10 min maximum - showed that battery was charged. I put it back in the camera, same thing happens again! I thought, this is an advertised original brand from a trusted company; I got a piece of junk not even worth getting it for free!"
4,Nice to have an extra battery for camera when traveling and shooting many pictures.,I recommend battery as replacement and/or extra battery for camera. Arrived quickly and the packaging did not contain any extra materials.
3,It fits my Coolpix P90,"This battery is better than the after-market add-on I got when I bought the camera new.It properly fits the camera, and does not seem to age like the after-market product.The Nikon batteries also seem to hold their charge longer, and last longer while in use."
4,Battery,It does what it is supposed to do and I wanted an extra battery for my vacation word word word
5,Always good having a spare on hand,My husband and I hike in some remote areas taking pictures of waterfalls and its always good having a spare battery along. Nothing worse then seeing that perfect shot and finding out your battery is dead.
3,Pass,If you can't buy a genuine Nikon battery ur out of luck. I didn't love this product. Charge life was marginal
5,Nice but there is a cheaper way,this battery is awsome charges in 2 hours or less and is actualy good for 150 pics or more as promised. You can get one of the knockoff batteries from a sell here on amazon for $6.88 that as far as I can tell works just as good. I have one of each but only for a few days now and each as been through a full charge and drain and I noticed no difference between them.
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,The pics show this to be an ORIGINAL Nikon stamped EN-EL5 battery. What was received was a generic battery which I could have paid less for with other options on Amazon.
5,battery review,I decided to try the cheaper batteries for my Nikon P90. They DO NOT SPRING out of the camera like the original Nikon battery. On a couple occasions I had to extricate the cheapies like a bad tooth with a pair of needlenose pliers. I am now buying two extra Nikon brand batteries. The cheapos will act as spares in a pinch. I do lots of bird and nature pictures so need to be able to change out the battery quickly since I may shoot 10-20 pix of quackers in motion. I do not want to be fumbling with the no-namo battery and miss a shot. I love my P90. This is my first digital. I am learning that we have traded to expense of film and developing the cost of batteries. You wouldn't buy second rate film or pay for second rate developing on a film camera. Please do not by second rate batteries.
2,Alert on this battery EN-EL5,"I went to replace this battery in my CoolPix P5100 and could not get the battery out of the camera normally. I finally had to force the battery out. It was just in time also, because the battery had swollen in the middle on front and back. It is a genuine Nikon EN-EL5 battery and the camera has never been in extreme heat.This is to warn people to check this battery more often than you would another battery.I am trying to find the Warranty Period if anyone knows."
1,Do Not Buy,"They say that this is a ""Nikon Battery' but when it cam is was some knock off replacement type battery"
2,Hard charging the first time,"I was initially disappointed when the Nikon EN-EL5 Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries I ordered didn't charge fully the first time. I did some research, and found out that when first charging, the batteries can overheat (meaning they have to be plugged in again and again), and this problem should not reoccur once they've gone through a charge/discharge cycle. We'll see."
5,Original Extra battery,I bought this battery as an extra one for the Nikon Coolpix S10 digital camera. I prefer original spares for my equipment.
4,Good advice about the advantage-driven résumé and other tips,"The two points in Bill Karlson's book, which had the most impact for me, were: 1. The need for me to resist looking for a job that I may be good at, but don't particularly like, in favor of looking for a career doing something that I am passionate about. It is incredible how many people I've contacted who try to shove me into the same pigeonhole I've been in before. My challenge is to try to communicate better about what I'm really about, what I need to be looking for. 2. The other is the concept of the advantage-driven résumé. I liked the concept the first time I heard you, but didn't really know how to execute it. Your example gives me a better tool to use to work out my own advantage-driven résumé. Thanks."
5,great series,"My son really liked this book, he came to me a few times laughing about something that was happening. This is part of a series of books by this author and I highly recommend it. He is at the age where he is starting to tell me reading is boring, so any set of books I can get that he actually likes reading is a win."
3,A little disappointing,"Let me start by saying that I am not only a lifelong Red Sox fan, but also a third generation fan. I got this dvd for my nephews hoping to share that love since they live several thousand miles from Fenway. As far as baby/toddler videos go, it's not all that exciting. My older nephew felt there was neither enough singing nor enough animals... And, he was REALLY disappointed that the big green monster wasn't an actual monter. (I guess he was expecting a relative of Elmo's?)"
1,cover art,"Haven't watched it, bought it for 3 grandsons but........why is there a large photo of a boy on the front and a small token photo of a girl on the back? Not good marketing."
3,Eh.,"This book was pretty good. It didn't really fully satisfy any one genre, however. . .if you're looking for a mystery you'll be left feeling unsatisfied, and if you're looking for a romance novel it also comes up short. Visually, Roberts does an excellent job of setting up characters and settings, but the characters, while likable, seem an unlikely match and I found myself never truly rooting too strongly for either of them."
4,Unexpected Delight,"I've read many of Nora Roberts books and this one is an unexpected delight. The story is a romantic murder mystery where high class, wealthy violinist meets a Mississippi Delta rich Casanova. The hero in this story is unassuming, old money wealthy, Southern boy suspected of murdering his past flings. Roberts maintains the mystery of the actual killer thoughout the story without damaging the romance building between the hero & heroine. If you like Nora Roberts, add this to your must read list."
4,who dun-it,"the story beyond trying to find the killer kept my attentions and with all books of this nature, i find myself thinking ""its him....no, its him...oh wait...its him"" which i absolutely love!this story takes the reader to a slower paced town in which everyone knows everyone. caroline comes to this town for the slower pace, but finds herself smack dab in the middle of a murder mystery. tucker, usually laid back (literally) falls for caroline and in the end, does all he can to protect her from the evil that lies in innocencethroughly enjoyed this one! ::smile"
5,Carnal Innocence,It is a very interesting book. All Nora Roberts books are very good. Shes an excellent author. Her books always keep me interested. I have a very hard time putting the books down.I purchased this book from Amazon and I was very satisfied with the transaction. Most of their sellers are great to deal with and at least 98% of the books are in really good shape. I'm going to continue buying books from Amazon as long as I can buy books.
5,Carnal Innocence,This is a wonderful book. Anyone who enjoys romance and suspence will love this book. And shape of book is just as it was written even better. Feel safe buying from from this person. Sandra
3,"Good book, Kindle version needs proofreading","I love Nora Roberts' novels, I have read nearly all of them. Having recently acquired a Kindle, I wanted to start building my collection, so I bought this one. I am really disappointed at the constant typos, they are very frequent and obvious. If the publisher is going to charge more for the Kindle version than a paperback, they should at least provide a good readable copy. Chasing Fire was fine, but I am definitely going to hesitate before buying another one of her older novels."
5,A pleasure as always,"Any book written by Nora Roberts is an enjoyable, easy read. They grip you right from the start and keep your interest all the way thru to the end. Her style of writing allows you to forget that you're reading and totally immerse yourself in the story. My only mistake on this book was mistakenly purchasing it in actual paper inasmuch as I'm addicted to reading books on my Kindle where I can increase the size of the text."
3,reprint,this is not a new book...this is an old book that they re-printed as a hardcover so has a more current publishing date.
5,Another good book.,"I enjoy this book also, liked reading it loved the author read a lot of books. Liked many of her books. Worth it."
2,"Ridiculous, sick plot","The main character insists on staying alone in the house right near where they keep discovering raped and tortured, murdered girls that she knows. Right? No, I need to assert my independence. The plot twists just get more and more ridiculous as the book moves along. This must have been a book Nora Robert's publisher pushed her to finish for a deadline. Only reason I didn't give it zero stars is because generally Nora Roberts is a decent read."
2,Carnal Innocence- Not for me,"Sorry Nora,, not this time for me.Drags along- with too many people and drove me crazy with the southern drawl. To me, it was overdone( too long) and would have liked to learn more about The Mother and Daughter ending. I skipped to the end so maybe I missed that, it just went on and on for me. It did have a surprise ending though. I liked Genuine Lies By Nora.JMO"
5,October Rust,"If you are a Type O Negative, you NEED to purchase this album! It's not the greatest album, but it's really good!"
2,what is this?,"ok, im not sure about some people, but this is not what i thought it would be...different..some tracks are just noise...there was one i liked...my girlfriends girlfriend...however, ill give it two stars for that, and i respect the work they put into it...."
2,Bland Goth Metal,"This is a bland goth metal offering especially with all the hype surrounding the band. Said dedicated to Shane Lassen of The Electric Hellfire Club. The music is boring and lacks style, not even a creepy atmosphere. A weak album by a supposed goth rock icon. Famous enough to get in Playgirl- so was Winger..."
4,Filler keeps this from a five star LP,"Incredible music/lyrics for most of the LP but, unfortunately, a fair amount of filler included will keep your hand near the fast-forward button. When TON hits home on October Rust, they hit deep. Wolf Moon and Haunted are my favorites."
5,This Album Saved My Life...,"It's true! (...) That's how powerful this album is! All the songs are amazing (even the kind of annoying stuff like ""Bad Ground and the end of ""Red Water""). The songwriting displays a seldom seen talent for creating moods and atmospheres within the songs. To be honest, I'm quite a sucker for more violent music, like Meshuggah or Slayer, but no other album has affected me quite like this one.BUY IT! (trust me, it's a lifesaver)Peace"
5,Instant Classic!,"I been a Type-O freak for 8 years ever since I was 13 when they first came out with ""Bloody Kisses"" which in my opinion is their absolute classic and then when ""October Rust"" came out I was astonished! not only being my other fav band of all time as well as Cradle Of Filth but their my most inspiring, Compared to the recent cd's which I cherish alot as well this is the most beautiful and melodic one yet, Type-O will always be the best and fav in my book of eternity, STAY NEGATIVE!"
5,The best,"Yes, in my opinion, this is the best Type O Negative CD out there. Filled with dark beauty, yet never going too far, each song on here belongs. Most people buy it for ""My Girlfriend's Girlfriend"", but if that is the only song you listen to, you are ripping yourself off. ""Red water (Christmas Mourning)"", ""Wolf moon"", ""Love you to death"", ""Haunted""... the list goes on and on; this CD, simply put, is a masterpiece."
5,Type o has come a long way,"Type o negative has come a long way from the comedic album Orgin of the Feces. Although funny, Feces lacked the passion, it was Carnivore all over again. Bloody Kisses came a bit further with passion but still had Feces influence. October Rust is the sound the band has searched for. Rust is beautiful and surreal and is a sound all to itself. I can only hope Type o's next album is this amazing. This is a must have. I have see Type O Five times and they continue to be one of my all time favorites."
4,"4.5 stars: After almost ten years, I keep coming back to it","I first heard Type O Negative thanks to a friend that gave me this album as a gift almost ten years ago. In 2005, I found myself digging back for it. The truth is I can't speak for any of their other albums, but with ""October Rust"" they pulled off a sound that I keep enjoying a decade later. Here I hear some Peter Murphy (the voice from Bauhaus), but also a definitive goth metal sound due to its overall dark feel.While not an album for every day, and with a couple of songs that I skip when they start playing, ""October Rust"" is still packed with timeless pieces, from ""Love you to Death"" and ""Red Water"" to ""Wolf Moon"" (the high point of the album) that you will find enjoying even after a long time has passed."
5,"The most unbelievable, original music I have ever heard!!","I have to say that they have definately done it again!! The music on this CD makes your soul want to scream out, when one song ends you crave for the next, when you can't listen to it for some uncermountable time frame you go crazy. I recommend that anybody who thoroughly enjoys Type-O to put in October Rust (What a name!!!!) , Bloody Kisses (special edition), and Slow, Deep and Hard into their CD player and hit SHUFFLE. I guarantee you will not be disapointed. ""Ditto"" on what marsalias@hotmail.com said except I gotta stay with the Cabernet Sauvignon!!"
5,Great,This TON CD was one of the greatest done by TON! Though it is said that it is to commercial I would have to agree but still one of the greatest
4,a few standout tracks,"i think this is much better than Bloody Kisses, don't ask me why, but i do. i think the standout tracks are, Red Water(Christmas Mourning), Love You To Death, Wolf's Moon, and Burnt Flowers Fallen. In Praise of Bacchus is ok toward the end. I like the Haunted but it's to slow and too long, i like long songs, but this one is the same thing. Be My Drrrrrrrruidess is pretty stupid. Die With Me is ok, but it has lousy lyrics. My Girlfriend's Girlfriend is very good too. All in all Type O is a great band, they bring the best of goth rock to the world. there are alot of good goth bands, but no one knows about them, and Type O may be what people need to realise goth is pretty good stuff."
4,A good little sports story for ages 8-10,"I remember reading this as a youngster over 30 years ago. The story is just a little bit dated, but not too bad.... most kids who are sports fans will probably enjoy this book.Rusty Ryan loves to play ice hockey, and he's pretty good. The problem is, he KNOWS he's good! When he moves to a new town and joins the high school hockey team, his big ego and tendency for selfish play don't make him any friends and gets him in hot water with the coach. Can he learn to put his selfishness aside and do what is best for the team?A good lesson about fair play, selflessness, and putting the team first."
4,Intriguing look at womens life in India,"Ginu Kumani creates a colorful and bizarre picture of women's sexuality in India. Many stories bring to light an interesting relationship between the young woman character, and her family as well as her coming to terms with her sexuality. I recommend this book for the light is sheds on the suppression of sexuality in India."
3,OK stories by a 'modern' Indian female author,Modern Indian (alot it immigrant) fiction by an Indian lady. A bent toward soft eroticism. Worth reading if you are into Indian (mild) erotica. Stories are nothing special though
1,if you like your erotica strange . . ..,"I was totally put off by this collection of short stories. I do read erotica and women's fiction but this falls into neither catgory. The sexual obsessiveness of the characters became slightly repulsive for me and I gave up after 4 stories. There is no beauty to this writing, no sensuality in the descriptions. All I can say is that it is crude and if you like that, go for it!"
3,Rubber rings don't last.,"The only problem I have with this item is the rubber accent rings. They don't last very long before starting to crack and then soon break and fall off. Other than that, it is a quality item. The chrome is good and it does dress up the engine."
3,Not as good as their other recording...,"Not bad, but not great either. I don't like it as mnuch as I liked their first CD that I got of theirs, but it may be able to grow on me.Tight band, good recording, talented musicians. Looking forward in seeing them perform in person. They're that good."
2,Bad,After seeing and loving the original S.W.A.T movie this one gives it a bad name. The movie sucked from the acting to directing and yes sadly parts of the story line needed improvement. I wish I didn't wast my time and money seeing it. Now I know why I never heard about it until tonight.
2,"Not good, but better than nothing.","It started out strong, But the action scenes left a lot to be desired.Really no plot twist at all very staight forward. Kind of a poor movie considering a lot of plot elements seemed to be introduced, but go nowhere.Characters where flat, very static. It is like a book, with a great first chapter, but it just kind of falls away like some kid trying to finish a short story for English class.If your choosing between this and a good movie you have seen before, just watch something you know is good."
1,This movie made me want to eat my own face,Where to start? The plot line is so full of holes it's painful. The 15 second backstories quickly get tiring. The cameras on the guns is just nauseating. And the knock off Joel McHale main character needs a few more acting lessons. Save yourself the 2 hours and do something more useful. Like eating pennies.
3,A Really Good Direct-to-DVD Movie,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Gabriel Macht (Suits) plays the SWAT Team Leader and is convincing. Simply put, he's one cool dude. Robert Patrick is always a convincing and scary bad guy. The rest of the acting was good too. The screenplay was well done and the movie was very well directed. Also, Carly Pope is absolutely Gorgeous! I wouldn't buy the DVD (unless it was on sale), but it was very worth the rental."
4,Safety Shoes,"The Safety Shoes Skecher work, with safety steel toe, are very very comfortable, sporty and nice design, the price is just, recommended."
4,Foot Protection,"The Blue Ridge wook boot (brown) with the steel toe are very comfortable. I install an extra foot insert to make for a tighter fit around my foot. This is my second pair. My first pair lasted about four years before the stitching started falling apart.The boots are a bit heavy, but that is to be expceted with a steel toe. They are a good value for the money."
3,They ARE tacky...,I only gave them three stars because they do feed the baby and because they are easy for him to hold. But they're incredibly thin and the pictures scratch off more and more after being in the dishwasher. The sippy cups leak.
3,Tacky,"I went to see these in the store before buying them. They are the tackiest bottles and cups I have ever seen.I decided to go with Avent bottles and cups, they may cost more, but they are more versatile and you can use them a lot longer."
4,Ahead Of Its Time,"Back in 96' when I couldn't get enough of rap-metal bands like 311 and Rage Against TheMachine I came across Dog Eat Dog on the Internet. I sampled them and gave it a thumbs up.Plus I read that they got band of the year in Canada. So I bought the CD. It was ...[great], heavyyet having flow. But they never really caught on commercially, which is a shame because theywere way before Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park or any of the new bands. It could be due to the factthat they haven't had a new album in 6 years or their label wouldn't stand behind them but theyare good. Play Games is a laid back/punk/rap album, that even features the RZA, while All BoroKings is more raw guitar/rap album. Its too bad they never got discovered by a label thatpromoted them better."
1,Deceptive Picture and it's a rip off,The picture shown is of a hobby box which contains 24 packs but that's not what they are selling. They are only selling individual packs with 8 cards per pack for over five dollars which is a rip off. I made the mistake of buying this product and I don't want other to make the same mistake I made. By the way you can get individual packs at places like Target for $2.99.
1,Disneyana: Guide To Pin Trading (Purchased on 07/16/2006),"As of today (8/19/06), I still have not received this product.I am very dissapointed"
3,Cool toy....but no bubbles??,"I purchased this toy today at my local toys r us store. I just got it out of the packaging...basically, the packaging is destroyed! The lights and sound work fine...but no bubbles?? I think the bubbles would be interesting to babies...so I will contact the manufacturer...there is no way I can get it back into its box to take it back to the store!!As for it being to loud...it does have 2 settings...but the low setting is still pretty loud, considering that it is suppose to lull the baby to sleep. But, my baby is used to sleeping with music, so I think it will be fine."
2,Not worth it,"I ourchased this for my 10 month old for Christmas, and it is broken. It worked great Christmas morning, and that was it. The big button the baby uses to turn it on and off doesnt work. He cant even play with it. A total waste of money."
5,Cute & fun!,"I bought this for my friend's infant son and he just loves it. She said the bubbles and music are relaxing for him and the twinkling lights get his attention. I bought another item by Thinkativity for my son, Sunny Sunshine. He likes it much more than his mobile."
2,A small step back for Deicide,"I personally like the sound of Deicide though the lyrics aren't always too clever. And this album doesn't change that...There's still the brutal sound of evil, but unfortunately evil does seem to be a little bit more stereotypical on this album than it was on their debut-album ""Amon - feasting the beast"". The originality and newness of the previous albums seem to have been forgotten a little bit which is also witnessed in their live performance."
4,another great album from one of death metal's best bands,"deicide has done it again with Once Upon the Cross. not as technical as Legion, but it retains its brutality and is to be included in any death metal collection. from the opening blast beats of once upon the cross to the slower when satan rules his world to the complex writing of confessional rape, this album smokes from start to finish. it is a must have and also a stepping stone from conventional heavy metal into truly brutal music. sell your souls to deicide!!!"
2,Deicide's worse...,"As a big fan of deicide i must say that i was realy let down while i heard ""Once upon the cross"" by deicide. I gave two starts because its deicide and both songs ""once upon the cross "", and, "" trick or betrayed"" are two good songs but the rest of the album is boring and not the deicide i know and love even the lirycs are a joke on this album. Im glad deicide did get their act together and kept releasing other good albums except this one... All in all ? Deicide is a great band and i love their music but once upon the cross is just horrible. Not recommended as a fan so dont buy it. Get serpents of the light and deicide's selftitle insted and the rest of deicide's albums but skip this once upon the cross!"
5,"Jesus, This Is Good","This is one of my favorite albums. It's incredibly heavy and fast. It's also surprisingly catchy in a metal sort of way. After I listen to this album, I'm singing ""Kill the christian, kill the christian..."" all day. I can't say if this is Deicide's best since I haven't listened to all of their albums yet, but I can say that it is one of the finest albums that I have listened to. Buy it. Listen to it. Love it. Share it with all of your friends and family members. Take it to church and share it with the congregation and clergy. They'll love it too. I guarantee it."
3,Nothing Special,"Many people hail this as one of Deicide's best album. I really dont get much out of it. Apart from the title track, there really isn't a song that catches your ear. I would much rather hear their 1st album.Its funny that people give Deicide bad reviews because they are anti-christian. Crawl to your cross fools."
2,SALYER MEETS SLAYER,"CD SOUNDS LIKE ONE CONTINOUS SONG CD IS FULL OF HEAVY RIFFS, BUT EVEY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME"
1,Deicide [stinks],"Deicide [stinks] ! I bought this album thinking that they actullie were good and had talent but hey, i was so so wrong ! Deicides ""Once Upon the cross"" is by far the worse deathmetal album ever !! Suffocation would give deicide a run for their money any day. Support bands like suffocation,dying fetus,morbidangel,hate-eternal,mortician, and godforbid leave garbage like deicide and cannibal cropse alone! ops i mean corpse (laughs) what a joke !!!"
1,Too little time on the album,"I thought the album was going to be very secular but it is just an album that is heavy but and against Christ from the start of the first song. Glen Benton has a good voice I do admit, and it blends well with the music. But the music is very offensive, really the lyrics are very offensive, and yes this album once you hear it will scare you, and i am not making this up. Listening to this will make you feel that Satan is sitting next too you. It scared me, and i am being honest. Glen Benton with all the respect should just focus on secular music. stuff is very deep, i dont recommend this at all. Too offensive."
4,A good Deicide album.,"With better production, fast paced songs, and a whole new batch of Christian onslaughts, Once Upon the Cross proves to be a good Deicide album. My only real complaint is how boring this album can get after listening to it far too much.Songs to check out: Once Upon the Cross, When Satan Rules This World, Kill The Christian, Trick or Betrayed."
5,Kill The Christian,"I love this album. Glen Benton, Decicide's frontman, is a very smart man. They had him on a program speaking about god and the devil and I was very amazed about how well he answered questions. Then again, mostly every metal artist has something to say but no cares. They think they just make songs about satan and killing people. I hate Christians and ive known a few in my life. They are very hypocritical and annoying to put it in a few kind words. Benton makes song about how he hates Christians and wants to kill them. Thank you Glen! I hate Christians! KILL THE CHRISTIANS!!!! KILL THE CHRISTIANS!!!!!! KILL THE CHRISTIANS..DEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Different Sound - Believe it or not,"Gotta say - this is probably the least fave of the deicide albums. I have heard great things said about it and it really depends on what style you like. For example, if you like the earlier stuff and aren't one for change than this album will strike you as different...There's less of the machine gun like drum onslaught in the background - so if you love the good old death metal sound, up along side early morbid angel and deicide albums than this is different, perhaps a progression, or a digression ?!"
5,Deicide is one of the most sophisticated death metal bands.,"Once Upon The Cross shows extremes of talent along with samples from movie ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", this albumn is in it's supreme. END"
2,More of the same old tired crap,"This is a very unremarkable album by a very unremarkable band. The riffs are completely generic, and the vocals sound like a barking dog. I admit I'm not a big fan of Deicide, in fact, I'm rather new to metal. A major metal-head friend of mine loaned me this CD, and I couldn't believe how mediocre this album is. I gave the CD back and said to keep any other Deicide CDs he had to himself. If I want devil metal, I'll listen to Slayer, at least they're innovative. If Deicide is the cutting edge of death metal, then I'd have to say that the industry is in serious trouble."
2,Deicide - 'Once Upon A Time' (Roadrunner),"How many of you actually realize what this band's name means? I will say the depth of this satanic metal almost scares me. With track titles like ""Christ Denied"", ""When Satan Ruled His World"", ""Kill The Christians"" and ""Children Of The Underworld"", you can tell these evil henchmen mean business. Problem is very few will probably take them seriously. Might appeal to some fans of Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, King Diamond and Death. Speaking of which, about their name,'Deicide' apparently means 'the death of God'. That alone would keep me from supporting this band. The music is okay, by the way."
1,"Why, Deicide, Why?","First let me make one thing quite clear. If you want to get into Deicide, buy Legion or their s/t. Don't even bother with this piece of (censored). This is where Deicide sold out, and anything beyond this is pure bullcrap. The lyrics have gone from constructive blasphemy to low brow vulgarity (""I will defecate on your Bible""? come on!) These guys have great musicianship skills, but they show no signs of songwriting or lyrical talent that was in their first two albums. This is a disgrace to death metal!"
1,Hmmm...mindless I'd say,"""Behold the one called Lucifer eternally damned. In caverns of despair. His mind infested with hate for you. May every soul of his death be aware. We reject you Satan the prince of hate. You'll pay dearly for the atrocities you've done. Your head will be crushed and vile gore spurt. It'll be all over for all who hate the Son. Vengeance is mine saith Almighty God. Whatever you sow you'll reap. Unlimited power is found in Christ. You must arise from your deceptive sleep."" Deicide needs to really stop cryig about how hard their lives are. They blame God for every single stupid mistake they made. What kinda logic is that? I have 1 last thing to say to all you brainwashed sheep who believe this band has been enlightened and speak the truth: ""Away with your satanic attire. Wake up mislead children of wrath. Escape the consequence of the fire."""
1,Useless Junk,"These guys sound like they lost there Minds. Why listen to satanic Lies? Jesus is the Real Deal. satan offers nothing but Garbled Lies. Jesus Died even for Glen Benton, even though He sings such Stupid Nonsense. Hopefully this Foolish Group with there insane Lyrics will wake up B4 it is to late.Don't Buy any of this useless Junk. satan will Bow B4 Jesus one day, just like all of us will. Obey Jesus New Covenant Gospel, and 4get this satanic Stupidity.it deserves no Stars, but had to put 1 unfortunately."
1,A Christian...,"People,wake up for Christ's sake! If you revere these guys, you'vebeen blinded by the evil one! Satan is the father of lies anda master of deception. You've been seduced by his lies.Open you eyes to the truth. It's not all relative, there is absolute truth! God is truth.Don't you realize that Satan is jealous of us? We have somethingthat he will never have. We have the possibility of going to Heaven if we repent and ask Godfor forgiveness. Jesus loves you more than you can possibly imagine. Don't blame Him just becausewe've messed up! Hell exists and it's infinitely worse than your worst nightmare.I used to listen to this type of stuff years ago (Slayer, Death etc) and by the grace of God I was converted. It's the bestthing that's ever happened to me.Turn back, you're on the road to hell!"
3,A pretty little thing,"I think I thought this might be a bit bigger, but it was quite a nice little piece. It works well on a chain I got a while ago. This is quite a nice little gift for any graduate. But not for everyone."
5,Living the Body Burden,"A fabulous book!! I laughed, I cried...I could relate to many of Ms. Handler's writings. So many women try to conform to the ""societal standards"" of what women are ""supposed to look like."" Ms. Handler certainly has a unique way with words and has expressed herself openly and honestly! How refreshing! I believe that this is a MUST READ book of quality, for women of all shapes and sizes. As a BBW (Big Beautiful Woman) that has accepted for a many years her size, I am glad to see that there is an author acknowledging the various sizes of women and the importance of self-acceptance regardless of size! I look forward to additional writings from Ms. Handler!"
4,pretty good overview,"This book provides a very good overview of the items on the DMX test. I just took this test this morning and with the help of this book scored an 88%. The book focused more on the application and asked some very detailed questions about the interface. I found the test to be more code intensive. Questions about the interface were usually pretty general. You really have to know how to hand-code HTML and CSS, along with a general knowledge of JavaScript code.Like the others have mentioned, this book is full of errata (which the publisher has yet to list corrections for on their site). Also, the book only comes with one computer-based test.If you use this book and the webmonkey HTML and CSS cheatsheets, you should do fine."
4,Decently Helpful,"I just took the test today and scored 89% to my suprise. 100% on Section I, 93% on Section II, and 75% on Section III of the Macromedia study guide. The book does help, but more so by going through the 'experience' of completing the chapters. Also read everyone else's reviews for this book for more helpful tips( e.g HTML & CSS cheat sheets at Web Monkey). Don't spend too much time on memorizing how to navigate around the IDE like the books says... very few questions on that. My tips too you: Experiment, and make sure you know the fundamentals ( even the little things you overlook ). Also as obvious as it may sound, use your common sense, if the answer doesn't sound right it probably isn't. The questions are pretty short and too the point, the answers can be tricky though. Good Luck! ..."
4,Prepares You For The Test,"This book did an excellent job of preparing me for the test, although the actual test questions were much harder than the chapter review questions given. It covers all the areas on the test and goes more into depth about the actual HTML code than most other Dreamweaver books.With so many high points, it is hard to believe some of the errors that are in this book. Having a wrong answer for a chapter review question is one thing, but having entire answer choices and screenshots missing is inexcusable.This is still the only avaible book specifically for Dreamweaver certificaiton. If your goal is to pass the test, this one is for you."
4,Good investment for the exam,"If you're going spend the time to study and pay the $100 to take the exam, this book is a sensible buy new, and a no-brainer used. I don't know how large the pool of exam questions is, but, unlike some other reviewers, my exam had maybe 10 questions that were mostly about the IDE (""If you're in X mode and you click Y, what happens next?""). I doubt that I would have passed the exam without this book alerting me to these types of questions. There are too many errors in the book's quizzes, but they're not confounding - the answer is given as ""C"" but the explanation clearly fits ""B"". Other than that, the book is solid."
4,A Complete guide with a few mistakes,"I had taken many tips from this site regarding this book but no book in the market covers all the modules for the exam.So I bought this book and studied it from cover to cover.Yes,the exam was much more challenging and some questions had to be read thrice to understand the language.But Thank God!!! I managed to get the pass the exam but not with a good score i had expected.The exam covers indepth knowledge of HTML,CSS,Javascript and dreamweaver's way of integrating Behaviors.So all those designers,please brush your code and fundamentals and some General knowldege like the IP address of your local web server and about FTP.Lastly,this book covers the entire contents needed for the exam but the mistakes should have been avoided and the CD should have been more useful.But untill anyone releases a book for the certification this study guide by Marc Campbell would serve the purpose."
4,More than basics,"I was looking for a book that has your basic Christmas cookie recipes. This one has some of those, but not as many as I was hoping for. It does have a good selection of cookies, however, and the recipes seem pretty easy to make."
2,Disappointed in style of the book,"If your looking for a book that shows a picture of each cookie your out of look - not a picture in the entire book. The book shows a sketch of each cook - not an actual picture. I find a picture helpful in knowing what the cookie should look like. The book does have a good selection of cookies but since it does not contain any pictures, I am giving it a low rating."
3,Interesting but Incomplete,"As an AH-64 pilot who has participated of OIF I was to say the least intrigued when I first heard of this title.The book includes information that will be of interest to those who enjoy tales of military aviation and includes photos and drawings of unit marking that are otherwise unavailable. The marking are notably incomplete, showing only one company within a battalion and leaving the others out.It's interesting to note that several members of my unit who are quoted in the book, profess to have never met the author...and he (the author) fails to footnote or otherwise indicate how he came up with these statements.It's a good start, but it doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of a great subject that begs to be covered fully."
4,Good Read,"A friend of mine told me about this book when he mentioned my unit (22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit) and our time in Afghanistan was mentioned. Solid, easy-to-follow story about the evolution and employment of the Apache.I really liked the artwork, and hoping they'll follow with other titles on the Blackhawk and Chinook."
5,Excellent,"This double live cd shows DTB at their finest. The band's singer, the recently added Mike Mattison, has a great voice and fits in perfectly, but the focus of the band is still on Trucks's amazing slide work. He is truly unlike any other player out there right now. This is a band that's not afraid to be creative and as a result they've done things that are truly unique. This album is an incredible bargain because it contains many new and unheard songs that you won't find on any DTB studio albums. Highlights are ""Volunteered Slavery"" ""Feel So Bad"" ""Joyful Noise"" and ""So Close, So Far Away"", but all of the songs and improvisations are played with great energy and passion. Amazing music.Disc 11 Kam-ma-lay2 Gonna Move3 Volunteered Slavery4 Sahib Teri Bandi - Maki Madni5 Leaving Trunk6 I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free7 Angola8 Feel So BadDisc 21 For My Brother2 Sonido Alegre3 Joyful Noise4 So Close, So Far Away5 Freddie's Dead"
4,"Great Playing, Not So Great Mix","Is it just me? I can't agree with those who rate the sound quality of this otherwise remarkable set. To these ears, there are too many vocals (and some flute) that sound a little off mike, and the balance between instruments is sometimes poor. Although it's not, it sounds to me like a live broadcast mix.That said, I'd walk across broken glass to see this band play.This set has a weird retail history, being touted first (I believe) as an iTunes-only release. I bought my copy for a very reasonable $9.98 from www.shopbootlegs.com, but it's out-of-stock there as at July 2007. I certainly wouldn't pay the exorbitant import price. Shop around."
1,"Not what it seem,s",Very unhappy!!this import is not a 2 cd set 7 songs for 47.00is a crime!!!!!!!!!!
1,Dereck Trucks Most Boring Guitarist?,"I love the Allman Bros. Band, I have to admit this up front. I gave D. Trucks so many chances, buying many of his cds and dvds....I have got to say that this guitarist starts off his songs with a sloooow build up that is so uninspired and while you wait for the band to get going and darn, you are routing for them to do so and guess what...nothing, de nada. The band more times than not fizzles always after a long build.....This guy does not know how to get into a groove that so so many others have done. Mr. Trucks, no offense but it may be time to put down your guitar and go back to what you may do better."
3,For JAZZ LOVERS it's great,"That said, it's not the Derek/Allman Brother's type of music that has made him such a prominent force in the last decade. It's very well done but it's definately much heavier on the jazz riffs than the blues. Reminiscent of many of the 70's masters like Roland Kirk and especially Pharoah Sanders (Volunteered Slavery). There's a very strong similarity to the Neville Brothers as a current reference point. My summnation...I wanted something bluesier. This isn't."
5,I have read this book 6 times!,"This is THE most interesting book I have ever read. BTW, I couldnt find this book anywhere locally. Thank you AMAZON.com!"
5,Great Book for anyone who enjoys ER,"I have to say this book was wonderful! It would be great for anyone who is glued to the TV on Thursday nights. As I read the stories, I actually imagined the story taking place at Cook County General with Mark,Carol,Carter,Elizabeth,Kerry and the rest of the crew. It is also great for anyone who has no clue as to what I am referring to. After reading it, I bought a second copy for my cousin who is an RN. I highly reccommend this book!"
3,Not for kids,"Parents Beware---Although this book was a blast to read, it isfor ADULTS ONLY!!! The content in this book constantly discusses casesof sexuality using words related to reproduction such as sex and oral sex and to the reproductive organs such as penis and vagina. It is my firm belief that the author was wrong in entering this kind of languange into this piece of literature.Thank you. END"
5,Powerful,"This little orange book has a lot to recommend it: The stories are powerful, sometimes for the hope they give, sometimes for the horror they reveal, sometimes for both. The writing is clear and easy to read, and goes by quickly. Perhaps most impressively, the pace and rhythm are such that in spite of the peaks of emotion achieved, burnout is avoided, with humor and hope slipping in to defuse the horror just when as it becomes too great to contain, and horror making its appearance just when we are so uplifted that we should burst. These are the best of the stories collected from over 15,000 ER staff members, so if you want to know the extremes of life at your local Emergency Room, don't bother with TV's ER, read this book instead."
5,Truly moving slice of life from a medical perspective.,"I love a book that brings home the drama of daily life in a way that makes you laugh and makes you cry. This book of short stories from the nations's emergency rooms covers everything from everyday mishaps to monumental tragedies; from the guy next door, to human monsters. Perhaps before the advent of the TV show, it may have seemed a bit graphic. But now that we all know how to perform our own kidney transplants, these anecdotes seem fairly tame. Some readers may not appreciate the author's familiarity with various bodily orifices and the unusual things that some people have used them for, so the book may not be OK for kids. My own kids who are in their early teens, and undisturbed by the fact that there's more to us than our fingers and toes, really enjoyed the book and were quite moved by some of the stories. So were many friends. A perfect ""people-read."" A great gift."
3,Most of the stories are only one page long. That's too short.,"- Most of the stories are only one page long.- A few of the stories are funny.- Overall, they're too short to stir up emotion.- In short, it's worth reading once."
1,Buyer Beware,"I have no issue with Amazon - great service and prices. I have an issue with Ricoh. This product DOES NOT last the life cycle that Ricoh claims (not even close), which is why I gave it one star."
4,Good Casual Conversation,"I'm not sure which CD the original reviewer of this albumn was listening to, but there is no music on this CD. It is a good CD of interviews with Chris, J.C., and Lance, no Justin or Joey unfortunately. You get to hear the guys talk about their lives together and their lives in music. It's very informative and the guys are very cute as always, but no new music. I would recommend it to someone who is interested in what these guys think about the job they do and the life they lead."
1,confused,"i bought this album thining that n*sync would talk about their lives but unfortunately the reviews given about this are completely wrong. alison is right, there are songs on this and it is not an interview so ignore some of the previous comments about this album"
2,Upsetting.,"Maybe this game is better on Wii, but I played it on Gamecube and thought it was horrible. The game moves slowly, which isn't an egregious crime for an RPG, but something I could have done without. My main problem with the game is the horrible controls for Gamecube players. I'm referring mostly to the combat system. It never feels natural, the camera moves around in ways that make it hard to see and the aiming system doesn't work. This game felt more like a chore than fun.I miss Zelda on Super Nintendo. That, to me, is the best Zelda ever. This game just doesn't feel right."
5,twilight princess,this version will be out on dec.11 2006 all ten seller have listed there product wrong oh and when it does come out it will be $49.99 in most stores if its more then you didnt shop around wal-mart toys r us and target to name a few i think even game stop is cheaper
2,When did Zelda become lame?,"Graphics are bland and there is little detail in most areas. I feel things just don't flow together at all either. The story seems very choppy. I search each map extensvely and sometimes there is just nothing there at all, why bother having huge area with nothing in it. The music gets very tedious after awhile; everytime an enemy approaches you get the same annoying music. I expected a graphical and musical extravaganza, but received mediocre graphics and sound. I guess I just expected more. Dungeons are very aggrivating, until you figure out what to do. I just don't see the fun in this game and that's unfortunate since I'm a fan of the Zelda series and it feels as this game was rushed."
5,Better late than never,"I was thoroughly happy with the game-play and story-line. I'm a little frustrated with the jump in difficulty relative to the older games, but other than a bit of a learning curve, its a great game that I'd recommend to all Zelda fans and RPG gamers alike. I'm very happy with the game and would give it a solid 9/10 personally."
5,ocarina of time 2.0!,i've been a zelda fan since before i could walk. i would sit and watch my aunt play for hours and when i was old enough to play i was instantly hooked on link to the past. Ocarina of time was one of the high points for series along with wind waker even if wind waker was a strange departure in both art style and storyline. Twilight Princess doesn't attempt to do anything differently it reminded me instantly of ocarina of time. From the locations(you revisit some of the temples from oot). I highly recommend this game i found the gamecube version more enjoyable but the wii version isn't bad either. Fans of the series are sure to love this and newcomers can find things to enjoy as well. Can't wait for skyward sword!
5,awesome!!!,"i used to own this game a few years back, but it was stolen along with my Wii and other GC and Wii games. having my favorite zelda game back is a great feeling."
4,not the best zelda game,a bad zelda but a good game i would rather have wind waker or skyward but a not bad game overall this is a good game it gets a 9.3 out of 10
5,BEST ZELDA YET!!!!,"Unbelievably good. Great graphics and great gameplay 50 hours in and just a little more than halfway through. Tons of things to accomplish. I suggest the game guide also or You might miss a lot. BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT !!!"
5,Game Lovers Attention!!!,"this is truly a great game for gamecube. this is probably the last good game for gamecube too. If you are interested in buying a gamecube game, this is the all time best. The puzzles in the game are challenging and the enamies are very creative. The effects are great and the combat is AWESOME! Overall, this is the BEST game for Gamecube. This is a great buy!!"
3,The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,I feel games The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess should have more free roaming and allow you to have other things to do even after you have beat the final boss.
3,Very Fun but Very Hard,"This game is really fun overall but it has to be the hardest Zelda game every made! The story line is pretty stupid and confusing and the things you have to figure out in order to move on are just ridiculous. I can't count how many times I've had to go online for help.It is definitely worth having but be prepared for a difficult and frustrating experience. It's just hard to figure out what you have to do next. It shouldn't be easy but it shouldn't be this hard either, I'm 23 for cryin' out loud and I can't figure alot out on my own.It's hard to decipher what you have to do to beat the bosses and mini bosses. There's always a weak spot and a pattern to find but it's so tough to figure out what they are. What sucks is when you finally figure out what to do, you think ""it should've been so easy, why didn't I think of that?"""
3,Unsure of this Zelda,"I've been a Zelda fan for years. Ever since I started playing Ocarina in 2000. I remember Christmas day 2006 when I got this, I was stunned by the graphics. How beautiful and realistic they were.This game is quite a leap for the Zelda series. A lot of the basic elements of gameplay are still there, but at the same time, it's different. Its quite different from OoT/MM/Wind Waker. I have to be honest that though a beautiful game, it does seem to be a bit unoriginal. twilight realm, really? playing as a wolf? really? I'd much rather sail on an ocean any day."
4,Defeats held,"I wish that when you cannot defeat a certain section, that they would let you continue on. It holds you there until you can defeat the big boss(Enemy)!"
4,Zelda scores,"This was a gift purchase for my grandson. I watched him play many happy hours with it during a recent visit, calling his friend when he got stuck on something, then moving on to new successes. It is just what he wanted and the product was totally satisfactory from the time of purchase through delivery to their home. I'd recommend it to other young game enthusiasts."
5,Twilight Princess,Huge Zelda fan OGZ since the 8 bits. Twilight Princess is even better than I thought it would be. This is the best game of the series and possibly ever made. Buy it!
5,Latest Zelda does not disappoint!,"If you have been a fan of the whole series, this latest iteration lives up to expectations. With a look and feel very reminiscent of Ocarina of Time, but with updated graphics, I was very pleased - and the fact that it is available for both the GameCube and the Wii is just fantastic."
5,Wonderful,"This game truly lives up to the legacy left by both Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. THe graphics are wonderful (especially for a gamecube game), and the gameplay is fun. The bosses, while not necessarily challenging, are both creative and amusing. My only bone to pick with the game is (semi-spoiler alert...sorta!) with the clawshot, and its complete inability to hook onto anything other than the clawshot targets. Yes, fellow Zelda fans, we cannot zoom around from rooftop to rooftop, nor can we swing from tree to tree. However, the clawshot targets are abundant, and in that way the problem is cercumvented. The items are fun, the story is new and interesting, and, on the whole, this game wins big points from me."
5,The Product of all Legend of Zelda games,"This game is the greatest game I have seen. I have both versions and love the Wii version slightly more than the Game Cube Version. The only reason is the aiming. I got used to the Wiimote system of aiming that when I came to the GC version it took a little getting used to, but once I did it was the same fun and challenging game."
4,Give It Time,"I'll make this review as short as possible. Legend of Zelda: The Twilight Princess has a very slow start, but a point in the game comes when you'll be riding your horse through plains and mountains and you'll be slaying huge bosses. This game is packed with thousands of details. Defenitley worth your money. The cut scenes are EXTREMELY corny, otherwise LoZ TP is an amazing game!"
3,GeoBeeGame,"Great one to start you kid get interested in the GeoBee contest. Our daughter is enjoying it so far. Watch-out, tourist card is kind of weird!"
3,A Beautiful Re-Creation of Over-Exposed Legrand Material,"Michel Legrand is one the biggest artists of music entertainment, a sensitive composer and arranger.Here you'll find a correct selection of Legrand's material with unnecessarily new arrangements though with an impeccable performance.Many of the songs in the repertoire are still available in CDs you can find here @Amazon and the best Legrand is the original Legrand.This album stands only for those who doesn't care about original takes and wishes just for a selection of the best Legrand."
4,"Fire and roots,","Morgan Heritage play some of the best roots on earth - this is positive, spiritualy uplifting music with excellent muscicianship to back it up. There's no slackness here.The album falters, however, in the few rap and r + b numbers. It is good that the band shows the desire to play a range of styles, but I think they'd be better off pulling off a dub version or a ska number.Yet there are only a few of those tunes, and they can easily be picked off in a mix or by converting to mp3.I'd recommend it to any serious reggae fan."
3,Wha?,"I expected more out of this album. Herritage is begin to falter. Nothing awe inspiring contained herewith. Shame really. I was introduced to Heritage when I went out on a limb with their ""live in europe"" cd, which by the way is a superb live set, and subsequently started to pick up the others. This I was hopeing would be a collection of masterpieces, judging seeing them live in Tampa, Fl, but alas... nothing seems new. A collection of tracks, whose rhythms are used by other artists, a couple of weak attempts, a couple of flops, a few very good tracks and you end up with something that lets you down for the most part. HOWEVER, I would still have bought it had I know all this before.Blessed loveKader"
4,"""Jewel Thieves is a party and you're there...RIPPINGTONS""","Not particularly fond of LIVE ALBUMS...but if you have any doubts, you won't afterlistening to tracks like ~ ""SHE LIKES TO WATCH""...""JEWEL THIEVES""...""SUMMERLOVERS""...and Russ Freeman(guitars) turns loose two outstanding musicians in their fieldPaul Taylor(sax) and Eric Marienthal(sax)...and those Latin themes ""AVENIDA DEL MAR""and ""SOUTH BEACH MAMBO""(love this one to pieces), highlights of staggeringproportions, is the icing on the cake.If you're a ""Rippington Junkie"", this is what you crave...don't hesitate, go man go...and beblown away with this latest from RUSS FREEMAN and THE RIPPINGTONS...and aspecial feature the STAR SPANGLED BANNER...gotta love it!Total Time: 65:43 on 14 Tracks ~ Peak/Concord 8508 ~ (2002)"
3,Never As Good As The First Time,"As live Rippingtons go, I still prefer ""Live In L.A."" over the latest release. Most of this album is pretty good but I could really do without the audience participation during ""Jewel Thieves"". And I have nothing against Jimi Hendrix but ""Purple Haze"" and ""Fire"" seem really out of place here. I would rather have had more Ripps to round this out."
1,Disappointed in Nukote quality,"The refill kit was a waste of time and money, not to mention a big mess. It took days for the ink to fade from my fingers. The refilled cartridge did not have any yellow output whatsoever, so it didn't print colors appropriately. Won't try that again!"
5,Effective for Fabric eating Burmese Feline,This has worked to help with our cat eating of fabric. However it does leave a residue that stays on the fabric sprayed and if it gets on your hands you will have a difficult time getting if off. So this product is not for the weak.
4,Great value,"I wanted to have something for my daily subway commute (NYC) and was a little worried about the ablility to distinguish the figures. But that turns out to be fine. The docking board works great for games at home, so overall, I find it easy to use, instructive with the mate-in-2 and opening trainer, and overall a good value. My only disappointment is that it does not have a front cover for protection, so if you plan like me to carry it in a bag or briefcase, you have to come up with some idea to protect the buttons from accidential activation. But that aside, I am very satisfied with the value."
3,hard to see,"Feature packed and light weight. I just can't get used to the lcd screen. Don't let the PDA styling fool you. The hand held unit is not touch sensitive and requires you to use the buttons to navigate around the screen takes some getting used to. I only used the unit about ten minutes and am dissapointed in the scrren. The LCD characters don't look like chess pieces they all look like dressed up pawns. The white characters are hard to see and even harder to tell what they are. I have read reviews that this is not a problem for most reviewers, but it is for me.I would like to see a touch screen and a truely PDA type screen though I agree that would probably be cost prohibitive for most people."
2,frustrating,"I'm so frustrated with this machine that I just bought a new chess computer from a different company. It's hard to tell the pieces apart on this computer, and even worse, it's very easy to accidentally ""change sides"" during a game -- but very hard to change back! So there I am, playing white, when suddenly the computer says FLIP and wants me to play black instead. Then it won't let me go back to white. After owning this product less than two months, I've given up and ordered a Saitek Maestro. The whole thing makes me miss my now defunct Jasper Novag."
2,The parts that work work well,"This is based on my ten year old son's opinion. He likes the hand held part. Unfortunately, when we connect it to the board, the hand held does not work - it just freezes up. We tried the trouble shooting suggestions (resetting), but still couldn't get it to work. Because he didn't care about using the board, we haven't pursued getting it fixed."
3,Teacher Guide,"This teacher guide offers material that enhances students learning, especially using Bloom's questions, as well as provide vocabulary that goes beyond a language reading program. You may not use all the information provided. I choose key materials that would be beneficial for my learners. I would recommend the product and adapt it your teaching style."
3,I BOUGHT THE WRONG THING,"UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS WORKOUT BECAUSE I ONLY HAVE A DVD PLAYER. WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE IT WAS A CARRIBBEAN WORKOUT I FAILED TO NOTE IT WAS NOT FOR MY DVD PLAYER. SHAME ON ME..."
3,Pretty boring,"Overall, My 5 year old daughter and I are very unimpressed by this game. We played one round and she said, ""That's it? It's kind of simple"" She seemed disappointed and did not want to play again. We are use to playing more complex games.That being said kids that don't like strategy type games will probably love it. I would think kids could start playing this game at 4 not 7. I also think my dauhter would have enjoyed the game a lot last year at 4 year old, so maybe the age range is just off."
4,almost could have been a 5,"Super fun. We play with the whole family 4,7,9, adults and we all enjoy it. My only complaint would be that the stickers on the bottom of the igloos come off after a while. We had to tape some of them back on w/ clear tape. (and they are needed to play the game)"
4,Suspense!,"This was a great suspense/spy thriller that captures the feeling of Spain quite well. The tale reads like a stock spy-thriller from the 60s, complete with pretty boy villains, double cross, murder and mayhem. The action and story are never sacrificed for the pretense of high blown language and useless descriptions. Instead, its a real page turner, highly recommended for Bond and spy fans everywhere! I rented it from my local library, and am sorry that its not available anymore for purchase."
2,I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THIS ONE,"AFTER SEEING HOW ENTERTAINING THE ORIGINAL ''SHAFT'' WAS, I WAS DISSAPOINTED BY THIS SEQUEL. THIS TIME, SHAFT INVESTIGATES THE MURDER OF AN OLD FRIEND. SOMETHING THAT MADE THE FIRST FILM SO ENJOYABLE IS SIMPLY JUST MISSING FROM THIS ONE. THIS FILM IS MEDIOCRE AT TIMES, BUT THANKS TO RICHARD ROUNDTREE'S LIKABLE PERFORMANCE, AND THANKS TO THE EXPLOSIVE FINAL HALF HOUR, THIS FILM IS WATCHABLE. ONCE AGAIN, THE THEME SONG IS A HIGHLIGHT. FOLLOWED BY SHAFT IN AFRICA."
4,Nu Yawk's Koolest,"Back in prehistoric times, John Shaft was the role model if you was a nice guy, Priest from Superfly was the man if you was dreaming of livin' the life. Shaft's Big Score the followup to the Cool Black crimefighter series, is a slickened up version of the much more grittier original. Still, the bad ... gets off. The climatic chase has been ""rescene"" in dozens of later films from Hollywood and around the world and Mr. Parks still doesn't get the proper props for bringing to the screen a cultural icon that despite time and Singleton's ""nephew"" is still the Man. The late Reverend O.C. Smith is too countrified for singing a Big City theme but the powers the be didn't want to pay Isaac""Black Moses-Voice of ... Reason Chef from South Park"" Hayes asking price. But there is a tease of what it might of been in the club scene where somebodys' girlfriend swirls to the early '70s funk. Never mind the usher pass the joint and hand me the gin Shaft Big Score is smokin' Jim."
3,Can You Dig It?,"Shaft's Big Score is a decent sequel, but the pacing is a bit slow at times. You can't beat The Theme From Shaft, but Big Score has got some tight music in it, keepin' it funky for the Private Dick whose a brotha man. Bumpy and Willie, my two favorite characters are back, and Bumpy is still tolerating Shaft while Bumpy maintains his hilarious disrepecting of him. About midway through is one of coolest scenes ever-Shaft is getting worked over backstage at a nightclub by Mob goons while the shots cut back and forth between busted jaws and writhing exotic dancers. The whole scene is scored with a heavily funky tune about the fuzz comin' 'round and what you gonna do when the mace comes down. Obviously, then you gotta just disrespect the Man and check this movie out."
4,Shaft 2 is 2,"Shaft's Big Score was the second entry of the series. The main let down was the music that was provided with O.C. Smith's vocals. It had some gems of dialogue like the elderly lady scene at the elevator. Being a vehicle showcasing black actors, it was a conversation piece for the African American while playing card or during breaks at work or school. It was a thrill to watch then and still is fun now."
4,11 of Their Best and Brightest Now Remastered and Repackaged!,"This mlps, gatefold design version of the second part of their greatest hits collection, ""Big Hits"", this album is subtitled ""Big Hits Vol.2)and is by far the better album. The sound quality is fantastic as our Japanese friends have yet again done a brilliant remastering job. The 11 tracks here include gems like ""Paint It Black"", ""Ruby Tuesday"", ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"", ""Let's Spend the Night Together"", ""Honky Tonk Women"", ""Dandelion"" and ""Street Fighting Man"", all of which would be on any greatest hits compilation of the band in any era. The octagonal shape of the cover, though is a little irritating as the paper insert that includes the English and Japanese lyrics sticks out when you put them together but overall, a good package as the great sound more than makes up for this little ""flaw"". Recommended."
5,One of the most healing books I've ever read,"I bought this book 12 years ago, but was so crushed at the time by the idea of having failed that I couldn't pick it up to read it. Now that I have, it's been a huge blessing.Carole Hyatt and Linda Gottlieb have written one of the most healing books I've ever read -- period. Anyone who thinks failure is a permanent condition should read this book.When Smart People Fail: Rebuilding Yourself for Success"
4,Excellent Book,I love the story between Atreus and Brianna you thought you knew where it was going butthe author puts in enough twist and turns that it holds you interest. I have read all three books in this trilogy and they have all been great.
2,Not Shelter at their best,"I have 2 Shelter albums in addition to this one, and the others are way better. They are much more hardcore and less poppy. When I got this album I was expecting ""Perfection Of Desire"", but the songs on ""Mantra"" were much slower, happier, and lighter. If perhaps you thought Shelter's older stuff, or Youth of Today was too hard, then maybe this album is for you; otherwise stick with their older stuff."
5,I remember the days.....,"Krishna-core ruled!!! I worshiped this band back in the 90's. I mean, I still do but man, the concerts in the 90's were amazing in Philly. Shelter came to the Troc a lot and I have such fond memories. I used to know every song lyric of Mantra by heart. Ray even commented to me once after a show about how I sang along to every song. This album just spoke to me and I would like to think that it did the same for those that were also drawn to Krishna Consciousness. Not one bad song on this cd. Take the bad reviews with a grain of salt, please. Listen for yourself."
1,"Mercy, Buddha!","I got this CD cheap at the local CD shop in my town and i sorta expected this to be like WHEN 20 SUMMERS PASS"". After the hysterical chanting intro, i get bombarded with the awful first track. In truth, the only songs i liked were ""Civilized Man"" and ""Surrender to your TV"". Personally, i think the lyrics are kinda lame and just sort of....there. No life changing songs or message, just a bad excuse for a hardcore record."
4,Almost very good.,"I get the sense listening to this recording that while MTT might be fully in it and trying to make a statement, that the orchestra really is not. They never sound fully commited. The playing is still very good, but it lacks a certain amount of passion. The sound is very good, as expected here. I think though that this was the start of where MTT started putting too much of himself in and leaving Mahler behind. This is in full effect in the 8th. I still prefer the Barshai version with the Young German Philharmonic. Both conducter and orchestra sound fully committed there. While this MTT-SFS recording is good, it does not move to the top of the list for me."
3,Worthwhile attempt doomed to superficiality,"I both loved and hated this video. While I applaud its attempt to introduce most of us English-speaking folk to the neglected Byzantine Empire, I mourn its superficiality.It is probably too much to hope that a subject as huge as the 1100 years of the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire could be covered in a few hours, of course. It would probably take 5 times as long to tell an adequate story of a world so remote from our own and of the divisions in world history and religious history caused by Constantine's decision to relocate. Even the great divide to this century can trace its roots to that decision 1,700 years ago.However, the visuals are interesting and it is exciting to see that not everything has vanished, although far too much was destroyed."
3,Byzantium,"Let me start by saying I enjoyed this video because of the very interesting information in this video. Lots of sites visited and described with historical significance . The music is wonderful. However, the presentation leaves a lot to be desired. It becomes almost monotone after a time."
5,Byzantium- Forever and Ever,"This was a beautiful master-piece from John Romer and TlC.I would recommend buying this film and really enjoyed disc 2 (Forver and Ever)It comes highly recommended from multile Law Professors, who studied the film after it's release. The images of Hagia Sophia or (St. Sophia) are splendor only one can dream of."
2,"Byzantium, The Lost Empire",This DVD provides a rather brief introduction to Byzantium. The photograpgy is good. Unfortunately the commentary by Romer occasionally is drowned-out by unnecessary loud music. A few place and name subtitles would be helpful.
2,Interesting subject made painfully dull!,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan historical documentaries and have been to many of the sites shown in this film, but ""Byzantium, The Lost Empire"" is basically just hours and hours of the host (who isn't particularly charismatic) droning on and on...and then on some more. The overall impression is that it's low budget and outdated; furthermore, the picture is grainy so it isn't even visually stimulating. I can only liken it to being stuck in the classroom of my least favorite teacher in school for half a day."
2,Propaganda?,"This is an infuriating film. I suppose that it must have been made with the cooperation, and perhaps under the supervision, of the Turkish government: never, not once, is the term ""Patriarch of Constantinople"" used. Even Patriarch Gennadios, who was doomed by God to be the Patriarch when the Turks conquered Constantinople, is referred to only as a ""Greek theologian""!!! I guess that the Turks insisted the proper respect not be shown him, for that would undermine their current campaign to force the Patriarchate to flee their stolen capital. The film's treatment of Orthodox theology is also very poor. Latin terms inappropriate to Orthodox ideas are used throughout, and ideas such as veneration are never distinguished from the more familiar worship. Maybe the writers assumed their audience would be at a rather low intellectual level. Still, the film should have been, could have been, much better. I give it two stars only for the visuals; turn off the sound."
2,"Beautiful filming, but no organization","I am surprised to see so many postive reviews for this programs. It could have been so much better. I was a disappointed with Romer. He seemed to pontificate without much substance. While the filming was beautiful, I thought the progam generally lacked any structure or organization. Rather than being a good overview of the byzantine empire, it was a hodge-podge of details and anecdotes. I finished the program without any greater understanding of Byzantium than when I started."
3,a little boring,"Although John Romer is excellent when telling the story, you have to use lots of imagination. He often tells: Imagine, yourself standing in the middle, of the procession, etc. and all what is shown by the camera is the same scene (generally a wall) over and over. A little re=creation would have been great, the kind done in the videos from the history channel. I had a hard time keeping myself awake and I really wanted to learn about this topic.One thing I was satisfied is that the content of the DVD covering that era is very complete."
2,Kinda Cheesy but it's tv,Made for tv movie from the popular books. Movie was a bit cheesy. Overacting is key. Too good of actors for such a bad script. Adam Beach and Wes Studi were poorly casted for such an amature movie. I couldn't possibly dumb down their talent for this case.
5,Good mystery,Great movie based on the book by Tony Hillerman. We Studi and Adam Beach make a great Chee/Leaphorn team.
1,the worst,"This movie is possibly the worst movie ever made. The acting and dialogue are of the quality seen in an elementary school play. The background music is loud and sounds like someone is playing a tape to fill in the many empty spots. The sound is so poor that it's often difficult to make out what the actors are saying, not that it matters.In the middle of the movie, we're suddenly shown new characters who come out of nowhere, have no meaning to the movie, and are not seen again after their brief appearance.I don't always expect a lot from gay themed movies, but even the worst ones I've seen are better than this. I know nothing about movie making, but I could have done better myself...."
4,Good independent production,Traveling to Olympia has plenty for most people. A good story line that keeps your interest. Enough erotica that is realistic but not a huge production. I expect to see more productions from this up and coming movie producer. I enjoyed Traveling to Olympia and I think most people will too. I am looking forward to future productions.
2,I don't think much.,"I collect pentatonic songs which serve a particular purpose--dialogue songs which are good for skits, canons, songs in a narrow range for instrumental beginners, and songs with repetitious lyrics for the campfire.I don't see anything special about the selection of songs in this book, however.If you want to collect pentatonic songs, you can do just as well by going to the library and browsing the 780 stacks."
5,"Yes, they work!","I was a little skeptical, but these straps do, indeed, work. What a great, cheap way to fix googles when their straps break! In fact, we just got new goggles for our 4 year old - and I noticed what a struggle it is to pull the strap over his head - and I think I may just get rid of the new (completely unbroken) straps and replace them with one of these."
4,Great replacement strap for goggles,"The bungee goggle straps have been a great replacement for the typical goggle strap. It took a few tries to get the first one onto the pair of goggles, but the second went like clockwork. Best of all, I've had not issues with it snagging on hair. The straps offer more flexibility in contouring the goggle to your face, shape, and head size allowing comfort with security."
5,Loved it!,"I absolutely loved Maggie's story. Liza perfectly captures how it feels to be a ""big girl"" in a society that considers only a size zero attractive. I was sorry to see it end and will add Liza Palmer to my list of favorite authors, looking forward to her future works."
3,"Difficult ""Easy"" Read","I really thought that this book would be an easy read and that I would finish it within a week, but I found the writing just to bother me, to the point where I had to put it down and read something else for awhile. I also have another book from the same publisher (Book: Stupid and Contagious) and it's similar in that it's also a difficult 'easy' read.I did end up finishing it. Some parts I laughed and some I thought about. But I was sort of dissatified."
3,Was ok...nothing special,"Book was an ok read...nothing special. Some of her comments were right on the money, just don't expect the book to have a lot of 'meat' to it."
2,Not so great,"The problem with this book is that is I ended up disliking both of the two main characters. You are supposed to hate the skinny best friend. But, the heroine is so whiney, cluelss and spineless it is hard to care about her at all. We are supposed to be proud of her-spoiler alert-because rather than have the guts to confront her best friend and tell she has turned into a self absorbed, selfish brat, she instead humiliates her in front of all the guests at her own wedding. That kind of mean, cheap shot does not seem very empowering, just nasty. The book is also not particularly well written or clever, it just seems like recycled chick lit drivel. I would skip this one. There are plenty of similar better written books out there."
3,Thoroughly enjoyed!,As a slightly plump(maybe more than slight) I loved the book! It was so great to have a heroine though unhappy with her weight was not a size 2 who just thought about belts all the time!
4,"Loved it, but could have done without the frequent ""f"" bombs","Funny, entertaining, easy to read, hard to put down. I would have given it five stars if the ""f bombs"" and other randoms profanity weren't strewn throughout the book. My favorite part of this book was ""the area"" topic, how Maggie ""deals"" in the end with the relationship with Olivia, and Gabriel's counting problem (I could relate)! The titles on each chapter were enticing: trying to figure out how they would relate to the story. Enjoy!"
5,Funny and True,"I really LOVED this book, it is so funny and touching. There is so much truth in it, not just about weight and size, but about female friendships. It doesn't matter if you are fat or thin, I highly recommmend this book, and look forward to more books by Liza Palmer!"
3,Pretty Good,"The book was pretty good. There were parts of it that I wanted just wanted to scream if you don't like your body do something about it. Luckily, she does."
3,"I think this is quite a disappointment compared to ""Beaches""","I bought this to complete the story of whatever happen after ""Beaches"". Sad to say, this is not as interesting."
3,not made in the USA,"Hi. I just wanted to point out two things about these chews. First of all, they are made in Mexico not the USA. Therefore, the ingredient list is misleading when it says ""American"" beef hide because it is meant to make you think that the beef hide is from the United States of America. More accurately, it should read, ""North American"" beef hide to distinquish it from being from Asia (note, the label does not specify the origin of the hydrolysed vegetable protein which could be wheat gluten). Secondly, these chews do not contain chlorhexidine like the ""C.E.T"" brand and this may be an ingredient you want if your dog has peridontal issues. My dogs like these chews and I think they do help to a small extent to clean the teeth. gb"
2,Enzadent Oral Dog Chews,"My Dog, Paddy, doesn't seem to like the flavor; she is indifferent relative to chewing them. Now I have expensive oral care chews that won't be used."
4,Early Canal Zone living realities chronicled,This book is a classic written by a Canal Zone policeman about the canal and its workers.It was widely read and quoted. It provided insight of how Zonians lived in the early days of the canal and some consulted it before seeking employment there.His police badge was 88 and thus its inclusion in the title. He was a keen observer and had an easy to read journalist style. He traveled through out the Caribbean and collected and published his impressions as well.
4,"ESSENTIAL READING, BUT IT LACKS EMOTION","When you go into a book written by RAF`s top scoring fighter pilot in WW II (until someone clarify the case fo Squadron LEader St.John Pattle, who maybe shot down 41 or more enemy aircraft, but who died in 1941 and was a South-AFrican) and this writes expends almos all the time saying that his dones in air combat meant nothing to him, that he was just a fligh leader, it's dissapointing. Anyway, JOhnson was the typical RAF pilot, and reading his book one understand very well the working of this fighter force."
3,Love triops but hard to get ones that'll hatch,"I've bought multiple packs of triops and have raised them many times. It seems that lately it's difficult to find triops that actually hatch. I've had one completely bum packet of eggs and this last one only two hatched. Still, the triops themselves are supercool and freaky. My seven year old likes them just as much as I do."
1,"DID NOT HATCH, 2ND ORDER AND STILL DID NOT HATCH","DID NOT HATCH, bought 2ND ORDER AND STILL DID NOT HATCHvery dissappointing for both me and my son!!!WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!"
1,No Triops No Cry o_O,"Follow the direction closely but none of the eggs hatched. Temperature, sunlight, water, everything was nice and proper but nothing happened after 72 hours. On the other hand, the Sea Monkey we purchased at the same time hatched after 24 hours... We were so looking forward to this, even with its limited lifespan of a few months. Oh well!"
2,Ineffective-never hatched!,The triops eggs never hatched and the directions were followed perfectly! I have had good luck with this product in the past but NOT this time! My students were VERY disappointed and so was I.
2,Cannibals,Only two or so survive to reach an inch. Be prepared for some cannibalism. Nasty as hell when they start eating eachother.
1,Pitiful,"This is the worst book you could possibly purchase to prepare for the PSAT. The format of its questions are irregular and foreign to that of the real PSAT. If you plan on preparing for National Merit, you should go with a Princeton Review book. Surprisingly, Barron's SAT prep book isn't that bad."
1,Get something else,"This book is extremely poorly edited and filled with errors. Although there are explanations for every question on the practice tests, many are entirely wrong. Example: How many 2 digit numbers are there which do NOT contain the number 9? The correct answer is 72. Their answer? 71...how? Subtract out ""..the ten numbers from 90 to 99 plus the 9 other numbers that end in 9: 9, 19,...,89"". That's a direct quote, and last I checked, 9 had just one digit. This is simply one of many examples of poor editing, and completely incorrect answers/explanations. Definitely try something else."
3,ok ok...but not free of mistakes,well its good for practice but lot of errors....but i feel best in the market but can be better
3,Colors Not Found in Nature,"Amazon has two different pictures of this throw...I thought, Well I like both patterns, so I'll get it.Wow, what I received is not either of the patterns shown! And no burgundy color, which is why I liked it.What I got is Blue, Orange and Pink!! OUCH! I'll post a picture for your viewing enjoyment.It IS nice an big and oh so soft and warm. I'll keep it. Colors aren't so bad when my eyes are closed during a nap :)"
3,"Classic Rooney! Telling like it is, but how only he sees it.","Rooney looks at life the way only he can. From tabloids, to squash, he's got it covered. The book allows you to see a lighter side to all those daily, around the house occurneces, and annoyances."
4,For the beginner or the Pro,"This book is great for the advanced user that just want to obtain some knowledge about the language or for the beginner that wants to learn an easy, multi-platform and internet-friendly language (easier than Java). *BUT* if you have other SAM'S ""Teach yourself (X language) in 24 hours"" you'll notice that this book seems to be more 'fast paced' than the others from SAM'S."
3,Good for fast learning; not so good for reference,I started off with the Welch book but quickly realised that it was not for beginners and switched off to this one. I think for a quick ramp up this book is good enough but you definitely need another book to take you to the next level.A word of caution/Public service message: Listing 8.5 on page 133 has a wrong analysis. I would have loved to put this in a errata but it doesn't exist. Luckily the said error is about globs which many people don't use anyway.
1,Lame Book not worth buying,".********************************************************I usually am enthusiatic about the books I review. Unfortunately, this book does not cut it. I chose it because of the high marks it received from other reviewers.Instead I recommend Pratcal Programming in Tcl and Tk, by Brent B. Welch. Here is a book which give you some value.If anyone wants to buy this book contact me, I have one for sale. I'll sell it for $5.Conrad B.

5,Good for Adults and Children,I teach 4th grade. Yoga for the Brain allows children to think more creatively & out of the box. I have written with the children during writing time. We have enjoyed sharing our ideas with one another. Get this book! It's fun and thought provoking!
5,helpful for young and old.,This book has been helpful in getting writing going. Not intimidating and for all ages to use.
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for ideas for daily journal writing as bellwork for my middle school language arts class. I was less than impressed with this book. Many of the topics ask for lists and I want my students to write in paragraphs. I also didn't feel that it had easy, quick journal topics, in fact I didn't like most of the topics. It was not what I was expecting."
4,A good classroom resource!,"Every Friday, my students complete an in-class writing prompt. This book provides many creative and engaging topics for students. My students look forward to the end of every week because they enjoy the fun, random topics, and they even are eager to share their work! This book is an excellent companion to Unjournaling, which is written by the same author. I definitely recommend both books."
4,A lot of good ideas!,This book contains a lot of good ideas for journal writing. The topics are varied to reach a diverse group of students.
3,"Good.....but, look else where for sustenance","For the most part I agree with the previous reviews, but after listening to this several times, it has a couple of gems but the rest are OK ""new"" flamenco, soft-jazz flamenco, and not something I would listen in total if I wanted to listen to a whole Flamenco CD, or a new Flamceno cd. I would strongly recommend Viva Flamenco [Audio CD] Various Artists instead, or if you prefer more solo guitar work any of the ""Gypsy"" series - Fire, Passion, which are excellent new flamenco cds. If you want the REAL thing, go to Flamenco World.com and treat yourself to the greatest solo flamenco album ever recorded - Sabicas Flamenco Puro - worth its weight in gold!"
3,crappy shipping,"The book is great, in perfect condition as promised. But I got expedited shipping since this book was for class...and the fastest they had was 4-8 days....well, it was promised at least by 8 days, and it came about 14 days after processed.When I tried to check the tracking on it, I couldn't, I could only check that it was ""supposed to arrive on or before sept 8"", but never the official tracking notification.I was severely disappointed."
3,Not good as I hope,"This book is not good as I hope, I have the book: City reader before so it was a bad dicission to buy this book afterward. The city reader book is much much better!!! However this book has covered most of the main components of city design! That's all."
3,A guy's book,"Buck Fever is all about Texas, deer hunting and mysteries. It is truly a guy' book. It deals with poachers, hunting, drug dealers and murder. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys these things."
3,Buck Fever not my kind of book,This book has taken me forever to read. Usually I can read a book rather quickly but this one has taken me a long time. I always finish a book once I start it but this one has me wondering if I will finish it. I probably would not recommend it to anyone else.
3,"Not well executed, but great premise and laugh our loud funny in spots","Some of the characters are just too stupid for words. Some are funny and some are just plain cardboard cutouts. The story works ok for the most part but is just a bit too contrived. Basically, a Longmire knock-off without the introspection or grittiness."
3,Entertaining Novel That Can Border On Absurdity,"This was a quick read and was entertaining at times. The plot centers around Game Warden John Marlin and a cast of characters in Blanco County, Texas. The book begins with a couple of poachers accidentally shooting a biologist who is dressed up in a doe costume. From there, the plot just gets crazier. In this book, Marlin will bump heads with a crooked ex-lobbyist, more poachers, Columbian drug runners, an unethical sheriff, and other eccentric inhabitants of Blanco County. The book had some moments of suspense and many humorous moments, but the plot also can border on absurdity."
4,Grand fun,"This was a fun read. Hiaasen/Dorsey-esque, and a most worthy effort. Great plot idea. Great characters. Setting is spot on. We'll see good things from this author."
4,Buck fever,This was a interesting book I enjoyed reading it sadly enough it was probably true to life a good reason
3,ALL BUCKED UP,"The good guys and the bad guys are self-evident in this cleverly told tale of avarice, deer hunting and good old-boys hanging out and drinking beer. There are some very likable characters, some very easy to dislike, and somewho couldn't find their way down a rope. All is well that ends well and this book does."
3,Funny,It was a little sporadic at first. It was hard to keep everyone straight. But once it can together it was very funny and you wanted to keep reading to see how these idiots would ever get through to the end.
2,A Hybrid Mystery,"This one will appeal to those who like their mysteries heavily spiced with humor and featuring folks who are almost comic-book characters rather than real, believable types. Everything and every character in the story defies logic. So if you like your stories to have some relationship to reality you may not find this to your liking; for better or worse that defines me. That said, the book is well written; it's not the product of an incompetent writer. It's just not my cup of tea."
2,Tries Way Too Hard,"I picked this up due to cover blurbs which suggest that Rehder is ""Texas' answer to Carl Hiaasen."" Well, he may be in time, but not with this first novel. It's not a bad book, but just a bit too madcap for me.Basically, the book follows John Marlin (what an original name that is!) as he investigates a drug smuggling ring that uses the unique method of sewing up cocaine into the bodies of the prize game deer owned by a local businessman/political hustler who swindled his game ranch from one of Marlin's old friends. There are plenty of weird characters and a lot of forced hilarity, but the whole thing just didn't work for me. I think Rehder was trying way too hard with this book and I hope he'll ease up a bit if there's a second novel in this series."
5,What a Hoot!,"At first, I thought this was going to be a man's book, deer hunting, game warden,etc. After a few pages I was hooked. Funny writing, bumbling rednecks, and lovable characters just trying to get along. I've read Bone Dry,too, and the writing only got better. I'll be reading the whole series and probably anything else Ben Rehder writes."
3,Buck Fever by Ben Rehder,First book I have read by this author. I found myself comparing him to C.J. Box and he came up short. But I will try another of his books.
3,Buck Fever,It had good bones. THe relationship written between the the hero and the nurse was a little juvinile. Interesting story line
2,Not My Interest Level,"Started this book but dropped it quickly. It just doesn't fit my type of mystery. My fault, not the authors..."
1,Why Does Everybody Love This Book?,"Dr.Gilda is not a man and does not know what they think! She has rotten ideas about how guys are supposed to respond to a girl's ""It Girl"" act, yet they will continue to take what they can regardless if they have it ""going on"" or not. In fact, most guys would not be attracted to a female if she read a book about how to attract them. She is planting deadly seeds about ""feminine wiles"" in teen's heads. Being a psychiatrist does not mean that she understands what guys think/feel, and this is her perception of how they SHOULD respond to that kind of show. To tell you the truth, this book is the scandal of the decade."
2,Cannot recommend,"This is one of my first reviews for any product. I guess, as the saying goes that bad news gets reported more often than good news. I like the look and weight of this watch and even the band is top notch. However, I received my watch with the little ""Invicta"" sign on the face of the watch broken. I guess that it became lose during shipping and it just floats inside of the face of the watch. It prevents the hour, minute, and second hands from turning. I do not believe that the watch was used since it looks brand new. Also, I do not blame Amazon in anyway for this and I am glad that they are indeed allowing me to return it. I have ordered many items from Amazon and 3 other watchs from them and I am very happy with both their service and prices.In short, I do not know if this was just one bad watch from Invicta but it scared me off the brand and their quailty control. I do not think that I will be buying another watch from said brand until they get their quailty up."
4,Look great!!,"I have already received my Grand Diver, as someone said it is big and heavy but not too much, at least for me... This weekend i am goint to test it on the sea, to see how it works under the water... By now, i think it is perfect considering the price, let's see later."
5,invicta grand. diver,"This watch is big and beautiful well worth the money. Its my favorite watch and i collect them, you wont be disappionted. Delivery was fast i would buy again !!!"
4,great purchase and great price,"I looked for a watch that was good size , I looked at all kinds of brands of watch and nothing matched the watch that I purchased. So far it runs good no loss of time so far. There is one thing I wished was better in all watches that has a luminated dial that one can see at night. Great watch Invicta Pro Diver"
1,Very poorly done,Riddled with errors and a complete waste of any Auburn fans time. If you buy this DVD you will be greatly dissappointed and very angry.
1,Must be Awful,I haven't even bought this DVD and I especially don't want to now. Knowing that whoever produced this thing has know idea what our team name is (War Eagles?) disgusts me even more. This is just some wannabe that I'm sure has every other Div. I school with the same type of DVD. Awful.
4,Cute stories but not quite as good as the first books,"Although Donald Sobol has written many wonderful books about Encycolpedia Brown this one required a little more guess work when trying to come up with the requisite solution. Encyclopedia Brown faces his favorite enemy, Bugs Meany and solves cases with his friend Sally. The stories are entertaining but some were a little hard to figure out such as deciphering punctuation and a blouse that was not reported missing. They were clues that were not obvious at all. It's still a good book but the earlier books were better done."
4,Like magic,"We've been trying for two years to get my very bright daughter to memorize math facts. We tried software; we tried flashcards; we tried bribes. Finally she's reached the age where she HAS to memorize this stuff or the consequences are very serious on math tests and newer math concepts. Out of desperation, I bought Turbo Twister. It was like Magic. The first night she spent 45 minutes on it. She hasn't let up much. I've got her doing 15 minutes before bed each night and it's not even a fight to get her to do it. She loves it.Guess what? It works. She knows her facts cold. That's allowed her to move much more quickly on math tests and to focus on the mathematics rather than on the computation.Normally I hate drill and kill software, but clearly the sound /music it plays and physical movement it requires of the user combine to make it attractive and powerful for memorizing. ...at least for my kid..As always,.your mileage may differ."
4,This is a good collection of Paul Simon songs,"This collection cerainly represents his greatest hits among the retail business, and it is a great CD if that is what you're looking for. But I find that with most artists, their songs that were not huge hits are often the best ones. So if you are truly interested in Paul Simon, I recommend trying a few of his other CD's. Definately his newer stuff, Graceland, etc., and a couple of his first albums would certainly wet your appetite.But if you are only partially fascinated with Paul Simon's work since Simon and Garfunkel, I can recommend this CD whole-heartedly. It is a great album, and I enjoy it."
4,Add This To Your Shopping Cart.,"When you listen to this album, you'll soon realize Paul Simon loves drums and big band sound. I have no clue what his lyrics are saying, but they're great poetry. 4 selecions on this disc from the Monster hit 'Graceland' plus many more we've learned to tap our feet to. My personal favourites if I had to pick a couple are 'You Can Call Me Al' and 'Kodachrome', however the whole disc is well worth having. A major work and very very good quality."
5,Great Movie But Amazon's Shipping for Pre-Order Sucks,"The five stars are for the movie. I give Amazon zero stars for fulfilling pre-orders. I pre-ordered this movie over a month ago and it still has not shipped out. I cancelled the order the purchased it somewhere else cheaper no less.Anyway, I love this movie. I am not a real Stallone fan but this movie is great.This movie should have been promoted much more than it was when it was released.The movie had a good storyline and plenty of action. It also had an allstar cast that included Harvey Keitel, Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, Sly Stallone, Kathy Moriarty, Annabella Sciorra, Robert Patrick, Malik Yorba and Peter Berg.What more could you ask for?"
3,Plot holes galore,"This was a good movie, fun to watch but hard to follow due to a great many plot inconsistancies. It's a little hard to take seriously a murder conspiracy where every member insists on having shouting matching detailing their plot in very public places. One cop who's death has been faked, wanders around town and attends parties with no concern of anyone realizing he's alive. When the fantasticaly poorly conspired plan starts to unravel, these supposedly trained investigators decide to fall back on a daylight kidnapping and murder, right in front of the local Sheriff, whom they know is not on their side.Stalone gave a fantastic performance as an underachieving cop who has been content to be walked on by ""the big boys"" until the conspiracy unfolds. Worth watching if your a cop movie buff, but don't get too wrapped in the story."
5,Great cast makes a great movie.,"With an all-star cast including Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Sylvester Stallone, Ray Liotta, Robert Patrick, Michael Rapaport, Janeane Garofalo and Frank Vincent, it is hard not to be impressed by this drama, about police corruption in a small town. The storyline is intriguing with a few surprises along the way, Keitel steals the movie, as crooked cop Ray Donlan. De Niro plays internal affairs copper Moe Tilden, who graduated from the academy with Donlan and holds a personal vendetta against him.Stallone put on a lot of weight for this film, wanting to play a serious role for a change, he does it quite well without being totally convincing in his role. Liotta is once again excellent as is Robert Patrick, this is a collectors item for all who love classic movies."
5,one of stallone's best,"I like Cop Land because of the ensemble cast of great actors and actresses. you got your Stallone and your DeNiro and your Keitel and your Liotta and your Berg and others that really put this movie to the level it should be. Stallone I think is great in this movie, period. his career got a little down hill when he made Driven and others beyond that but you look back at his other movies like this one and Daylight, Cliffhanger and the Rocky movies and you just remember the good roles. DeNiro is always sparking the screen with his big roles and this is another for his career. Liotta is great also and he's had some fine movies as well like Narc, Unlawful Entry, Turbulence, Identity and a whole lot of others. but anyway, this one is dynamite and it explodes at you. lots of action and mystery really connect the dots and I enjoyed the ride"
3,Sylvester deserves an Oscar,"I was blown away. Sylvester Stalone is an excellent actor in Cop Land. He is the one that makes this whole movie work. It's just a shame there was so much bad language in this movie. Overusing the F word too much gets really old. Cursing really doesn't bother me, it only does when it's used more than the rest of our words in a dictionary. Otherwise, this movie was well-written, and it's that kind of movie that makes you feel sorry for Sylvester because of the way he's treated."
3,Great Cast Not much story,"I will be honest the reason I rented this movie was because of the Cast. Ray Liotta to me had the best part in the movie of all of them. Then next would be Harvey Kietel as a corrupt New York Cop. Stallone is playing a small town Sherrif who is deaf in one ear(this gets played out in the movie) who has come to a New Jersey Suberb area and realizes that some of his friends in the Police Department nice or not turn out to be crooks. Robert Patrick another corrupt cop in the movie is good alongside in Keitels gang. The acting in this is very dissapointing. I was not blown away actually by De Niro's performance in this movie. I thought is was just a desperate attempt to use star power with an ensemble cast. You got to have a good platform for it to work.Directed by James MangoldSylvester Stallone, Ray Liotta, Robert Patrick, Harvey Kietel and Robert De Niro"
4,Cop Land (Director's Cut) DVD,A very well-made movie with a great cast and fine score by Howard Shore. The 1.85:1 picture is excellent and enhanced. Note how at the end of the movie the snub nose revolver in Ray Liotta's hand suddenly changes to a semi-automatic handgun (with which he shoots Harvey Keitel) and then immediately switches back to the snub nose revolver again.
4,Stalone shows his chops,The true mark of an good actor is to take chances. That's exactly what Sly Stallone did in Copland. He even went as far to gain some weight to play the part. While the storyline gets a little predictable near the end it's the characters that you are drawn too and what makes Copland a true joy to watch. This is well worth having in your video library and not just because of Stallone but because the movie itself draws you in until the very end. Well done.
5,Stallone's finest,"Mr Stallone is fantastically successful and, I'm sure, needs no praise from me. But for me, this is his best work. The all-star support cast are good and easily dislikeable, and Liotta is on form, but although the film is not perfect, that is precisely what makes it so good. Stallone's regretful, never-quite-good-enough Sheriff is the best character of all. Well worth a look. I wish he'd made more films like this. Take it for what it is and you won't be disappointed.Yours,Baby Cromwell, Nottingham, England"
4,lots of twists and love the plotline!,"this is a great movie! and dvd was in terrific shape, i really thought this had an interesting story to it."
4,this one was not that bad,"I just recently saw this movie and I dont understand why so many people hated it with so much passion. I thought it worked, I was never bored while watching it.Did anyone notice that Deborah Harry plays the bartender and her name is Delores? C'mon- A bartender named Delores in a film made by the same guy who made ""Heavy"", where Harry played a bartender/waitress named ""Delores"". Im pretty good with trivial matters."
3,POWERHOUSE PERFORMANCES,"THIS FILM IS VERY ENTERTAINING,SUPERBLY ACTED,AND WELL MADE. STALLONE ACTS BETTER IN THIS FILM THAN HE USUALLY DOES (NOT THATHE'S A BAD ACTOR). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR VIEWERS WHO WANT TO SEE STALLONE IN A MORE MATURE ROLE OTHER THAN RAMBO."
5,Great Watch,"Great watch, nice to add to my Collection, I love all Invicta watches, this one is great quality and the blue stands out"
2,too big,"We returned the watch. Although we loved the color scheme, the face was way too big even for a man."
5,great fitting and looking watch,"I collect watches , many Invicta's , Currently have about 65 in my collection. I bought an invicta lefty in a pea green and gold face and a pea green canvas strap and in a week had more than 10 people tell me how beautiful it was , so I went with the blue face and leather band . Same reaction, These are the I Force Lefty's. I intend on buying more of these."
5,"great compilation cd. singles, album cuts, b sides","despite some critical acclaim this band is strangely unknown in the usa. strange considering how good they are that is. this compilation is by far their best cd (or album) i've heard. i had a couple of their other albums back in the day but none of them impressed me as much as this one has. i've played it non stop since i got it. basically their music is sophisticated, arty, aussie folk rock with slight punk rock influences. a kind of non aggressive (romantic) guitar rock. many of the songs are catchy. i got my copy used for 8 bucks. it's my best cd buy in ages."
4,BRILLIANT!,"A Vin Diesel collection wich shows the unlimited capabilities of the artist. Issues like gambling identity racism but also trying to survive like an artist today come in really sophisticated short stories.A very good job,i recommend it for your collection."
5,The best yet from DVDMags,"I've been buying the Short series since I heard that one included ""La Jetee,"" and I've been hooked ever since. Volume 5, while short, is by far the strongest collection overall. Multi Facial, in particular, as well as Buy My Film, are great. Their compressionist is doing a better job, as well, and the graphics are the best you'll see on any dvd."
5,very good,"i bought this for Vin Diesel's movie and was really pleased to see it was as good as i thought it would be. an early effort that explains that Vin is so much more than the ""muscle guy""!"
5,"""VINtastic""","A MUST FOR ALL VIN DIESEL FANS. SEE VIN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF HIS CAREER. ALL STORIES ON THIS DVD ARE REALLY GOOD--BUT MY FAVORITE IS DE""VIN""ETLY ""MULTI-FACIAL."" WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE."
5,Vin Diesel Can Act,"The reason I bought this dvd was to see MultiFacial. I wanted to see what Steven Spielberg saw in Vin Diesel. I enjoyed it. I felt Vin Diesel's pain through all the rejection. It seems as if he was baring his soul. He, in the end, realizes that maybe he is not alone and other actors experience rejection on many levels."
4,HOLDS YOUR INTEREST AT ANY AGE,"SUPPENSE RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. LOTS OF ACTION, ROMANCE & DESCRIPTIONS OF DIFFERENT AREAS TRAVELED. ENJOYED THE MAIN CHARACTER'S SENSE OF ADVENTURE."
4,read the original,"I've watched the movies, read the graphic novels, but the was still something special about setting down and reading the story as Jules Verne wrote it. The ending was a litle hollow for this time, but it was in keeping with the emptiness of the anti-hero Nemo. This is a strange tale revolving around not a hero and a villian, but a hero and and an anti-hero. Both men are in a sense empty, Professer Anarax has spent his studing the world, but not living in it. Captain Nemo has lost everything that gave his life mean, and in the end he discovers that even revenage is meaningless there by losing his will to live. The professer abosorbed by all that he has seen and experianced now has a reason to live. And so he now tell the world the wonders of the seas. A fun read, it is a classic."
4,Le Tour Du Monde,"I chose this title after the anniversary of Jules Verne's birth was celebrated with a ""google"" icon. I don't believe that I have ever read this JV tale before this reading. I am not quite sure what to make of this story. Certainly it has inspired many adaptations over the years as have many of Verne stories. Phileas Fogg is a hero unlike any others in my experience of reading. He has absolute faith and his stoicism is a bit off putting. How we come to root for him in his quest is somewhat of a mystery until an incident (no spoiler here) midway through the book. I will also not give away the surprise at the conclusion of the voyage. Though in this day I would not expect that modern readers will be surprised. Jules Verne does foreshadow the ending quite a bit.Thank you Kindle for making this and other Verne titles available."
5,"Jules Vern-Around the World in Eighty Days, student edition","I bought this for my son when he was in grade school to encourage him to read. This is a specially adapted version for young readers by Marian Leighton.Exciting reading with good illustrations:I'll bet you 20,000 pounds that I can travel around the world in 80 days!"" said Phileas Fogg. The time is 1872, when trains and steamships are the fastest means of travel. Across Egypt and India, through Hong Kong, Japan and America he goes.........Imagine your child reading exciting history, and not being able to put the book down."
4,the book is great,"""Around the World in Eighty Days"" is about a man named Phileas Fogg who is challenged to go around the world in eighty days. Fogg is an English man who is very calm, generous, kind hearted, and precise. He is a man who never rushes, and always on track. Even though, the journey might seem impossible for him, but he is full of confident that he will make it in eighty days.The journey was full of excitements and problems. The main problem is that Mr. Fix suspects that Fogg is a bank robber and tries to stop him during the journey. Throughout the story, Mr. Fix tries to get help from Passé partout who treat him opium and alcohol. Which caused the relations between Fix and Passé partout went bad. However, there's a twist that Mr. Fix decided to help Fogg out after he rescued Passé partout from the Indians.I think the ending of the book is kind of peaceful and amusing. The journey sounds fun and adventurous, and I would wish to have this kind of experience some day."
5,Classic.,I was grew up in Asia so reading the classic stories is one of my interest. I love it that I don't have to go to the library to borrow & return them.
4,a little bit old fashion but fun,The way of writing was old but the story is interesting and the adventures is exciting. I am not disappointed reading it.
2,Detail can be boring.,"This novel my Jules Verne is about a man named Phileas Fog and his bet to make it around the world in eighty days. Phileas Fog is a very precise man and hates unpreciseness. He takes along his newly hired ""servant"" along with him for the journey. The story is full of there travels and bumps along the way. So do they make it. Well you will have to read it and find out wont you.Well I have to say this is definately not one of my favorites and will not read it again in my near future. This book is crammed full of detail you dont need! You could skip all the detail and you'd be fine on they story line. I found it really hard to read because the details made it boring for me so I had no desire to pick this book and read it they way other books make me do. I wouldn't recomend it to anybody however amidst the detail the story line and plot is pretty good."
4,Enjoyable Read,"Great classic. There are times the author is overly wordy and prolongs an incident beyond what is required. Nonetheless, the story is entertaining and the characters are introduced well."
4,Around The World In Eighty Days,"This book was pretty good. The main characters, Phileas Fogg and his servant Passepourt make a wager of twenty thousand pound that they can travel around the world in eighty days. Along the way, they have to travel as fast as they can while somehow they have some crazy adventures. Such as meeting a beautiful indian princess, they get arrested because they look like a thief that a detective has been looking for, and all sorts of crazy stuff. This book is really good for people who like adventure books but it is still good for anyone who likes to read"
5,a classic,"Around the World in Eighty Days is a very good read. It's a very exciting and adventurous book that is very fast paced. Around the World in Eighty Days is not difficult to read, Verne gives just enough description and keeps the plot moving continuously"
4,A great book,"Around The World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne is more true to life thanother books by Verne. The movie starring David Niven is a good movie.By Danny Karl Fleming, author of How to Prove The Collatz Conjecture."
1,Snooze bore,The movies were done better no offens to Julie s vere this just happens to be a boring book. The other were better.
4,Oldie but a goodie,"Fist time I have read this, I expected it to be more like the movie with Jackie Chan. Glad I read it and got to know what the original was really like."
4,Classic,Enjoyed the book when I read it as a child. Enjoyed the movie versions. Still enjoy it today. Timeless story.
5,Awesome adventure story,"I loved this book because even though many people thought he could not make this trip, Phileas Fogg still managed to prove everyone wrong despite the many obstacles that were put in his way. His strength and determination showed that he is a man of his word. Anyone who loves a great adventure story should definitely read this book."
5,Can't Beat the Price!,Excellent way to read Jules Verne. My 6 year old and I started reading the paperback and switched to the Kindle half way through the book. He loves pressing the next page button as we read. We turned on the voice and had a laugh listening to the computer voice pronouncing some of the Victorian English translation of French.
3,A fun but clunky story,"I can understand how this book must have been very popular in its time. It presented snapshots of other cultures and places not well known to people of the 1870s and mentioned every transportation method available at that time. Although it is a fun story of adventure, travel, romance, comedy, and mystery--it is also clunky, predictable, sometimes slow, and full of cardboard characters. It is fun for what it is but don't expect too much. Probably the most interesting to me was how the snapshots of culture and far away places were portrayed. Worth a read if you are a fan of the classics. Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues and Mysterious Island were better."
3,Fun,"That is it. This story is a fun read. Keeps you entertained for a good while.This is not the movie. No Chinese Kung Fu. No stolen Buddha. No airplane. No Royal Academy of Science. The list goes on...The story is good. The reason as to the low star count is simply because of Verne's absolute hate for everything in the USA. Every chance he gets he makes a hateful comment about the USA and its people. And when Fogg is traveling through the USA, everything is criticized. He spend a whole chapter criticizing San Fransisco and its people, a whole other chapter making fun of Mormons, he does not forget to mention how savage Native Americans were, oh and how stupid they were too. I could keep going.If you understand how closed minded people were in Verne's time, then you'll be OK reading it.Yes, you will have lots of fun reading it. I did. Just be sure you are feeling open minded before starting it. Otherwise you are in for a very disappointing and angering read."
3,A bit boring,"I'll keep this short and sweet. I picked up this book with great expectations, hearing from various others about it's qaulity. Unfortunately, I was mostly dissapointed. This book, most definitly, has adventure and some very interesting parts, except they are few and far between. Verne is much too consumed with irrelevant details to the point of boredem and loss of attention span."
5,Jules Rules,"Sorry for the tilte of my review but I could not help it. This is a great work. Of course it does not hold the same facination today as it would in 1872. Nonetheless it is a great work and a lot of fun to read.One thing that I found very interesting is that many of the things that we take for granted today required explaining in 1872. For example, the author felt it was important to describe to his readers what a banna was like. What author would need to do that today ? Of course mu8ch of the style etc etc is very differnet than today's. But the writing is similar enough that the book is an easy read.I am not sure if I would grant this status as a classic but I would definitly recommend the book. I would especially recommend the book to younger readers."
1,Terrible book!,"Between the racism, the drug and alcohol references and the tedium of language this is a very uncomfortable book. If you just want to read a classic, sure, but if you are bothered by hate speech avoid it."
5,Around the World in Eighty Days,"The book even though Sci-Fi, is a fantastic look at today's modern living, with the encounters of the inventors of his day, but bringing them through into the modern world. A true writer of his times."
3,My first Verne,"This was my first Verne book and I shall pick up another. I like the way it's written, it seems really ""pleasant"", quite refreshing, actually how I feel when I read an Agatha Christie book. There were a few parts I could have done without, seemed a bit long-winded, but take out those parts and the story was really good, can't wait to check out the movie."
3,"Dated, but enjoyable","This seemed like one of those classic books I should have already read, so when I saw it was public domain I decided to give it a try. Not the action-packed drama I thought it would be, but nonetheless a fun story showing glimpses of life in the 1800's. And hey, I learned some new words too (thanks to the Kindle's dictionary feature)."
2,a classic?,"This is my first Jules Verne book, and I must say that I'm disappointed. This is a ""classic""? Everything is viewed from afar. Verne never let me feel as though I were right there. There is almost no dialogue, and even the action is related as though it were second-hand. Although I didn't expect it to be in Jane Austen's league, from its reputation I was hoping for something in the range of Stevenson, Tolkien, and Wells. It's not. This sort of storytelling is more of the Edgar Rice Burroughs or Stephen King variety."
4,My 3 year old likes this,"My son (6) got this as a gift but his 3 year old sister prefers it for the game to find Pal. The crying baby sound is extremely annoying, but the book is otherwise entertaining although not particularly educational. There are too few Leap Pad books in the collection, we're starting to get desperate to locate acceptable titles."
2,Not worth the money,"I concur with other review. Places too little emphasis on educating, too much on playing a game."
2,undecided,"I PUCHASE THIS ITEM, BUT CAN'T GIVE IT A GOOD REVIEW, BECAUSE IT WILL NOT WORK WITH MY FIRST LEAPPAD, I WILL BE RETURNING IT, I WISH IT HAD LISTED THAT IT DOESN'T WORK WITH MY FIRST LEAPPAD IN THE PRODUCT DETAIL, ALSO HAVE ANOTHER BOOK AGAIN DOES NOT WORK WITH MY FIRST LEAPPAD, WHERE CAN YOU FIND A BOOK UNDER THE SAME PRICE THAT WORK WITH MY FIRST LEAP PAD. I HAVE A SET OF TWINS & I NEED ANOTHER BOOK"
3,"In ""Julia Misbehaves,"" Liz receives her first serious screen kiss from Peter Lawford...","Her love scenes, in fact, convinced MGM that their mature sixteen-year-old was prepared to take on adult roles...But Taylor's romancing is secondary, the film being designed as a showcase for Greer Garson to prove that Metro's gracious tea-serving lady had some fun in her... As the misbehaving Julia, a circus trouper and woman about town, Garson returns to the society husband she left years ago, because her young daughter is to be married and has sent for her...Taylor plays the nave, unsophisticated girl, saved at the end from marrying the wrong man... She merely had to look pretty, and it's the first time that she seems like a clever and suave made-up movie starlet and nothing else..."
2,Not as good as other Star Wars books,"This book was VERY, VERY disappointing to me and the I've only read a few Star Wars Books. The book was difficult to understand in some parts and boring in others, with 1 or 2 exciting parts. I liked Rogue Squadron more than this, it was the only other X-wing book I read."
2,Pretty typical X-Wing series stuff.,"This book is not all that good. There are still some serious problems with the number of characters involved, and the characteristics of the ships. Some of the tactics are a little questionable, and some of the jokes are a little lame. The plot was pretty weak, which is characteristic of the series as a whole. I would rather have the Jedi Academy Trilogy instead."
5,It's definately a Star Wars book!!!,"Personaly, I think it was fantastic book. Some parts are hard to understand at first, but I've been reading Star Wars for so long, it seems like second nature to me. There was a lot of humor in the book, and that's terrific. There's also plenty of action, so it's definately NOT boring. Aaron Allston did a great job, and I'm sure Iron Fist is just as good(probably since I read it). I can't wait until the next book comes out."
1,Why? Stackpole why did you leave us?,"This book is an insult. I read the first four because I love space combat. When I found out that Aaron Allston wrote the next one, I bought it and read it anyway, hoping for the best. BAH! He uses far to much slapstick humor, and everyone is a bad pilot(he makes Wedge seem like one!)Wes Janson was funny, however.(everyone else thinks they're funny, but really not)He did have fairly good characterization, but Stackpole's eighth book was an incredible relief. Allston came right back around and insulted Wedge Antilles with the ninth book, but at least I could get through that one. The Rogues could beat the Wraiths hands-down--in the air OR on the ground(where the Wraiths are supposed to be really good)If you're reading through the series, read it, but otherwise STAY AWAY!!!!"
4,"Could be better, but still was fun to read.","Well, many others have said that this book is lacking when it comes to the villians. In Zahn's Trilogy, he described Thrawn as a brilliant tactician, much like Allston speaks of Trigit here. The exception is the Thrawn WAS a brilliant tactician in Zahn's books, and in this one, Trigit failed to devise strategies or any kind of tactics. Therefore, while reading this book, the reader expects Trigit to lose every battle he goes into. I think even I could have written this villian better. Other then that, the book follows the X-wing series just as Stackpole started it. If Trigit had more brains, this book would get 5 stars."
3,okay,"this was a sortof good book, but I love villians and this book SUCKED at that and of the stick. pretty good. Too bad you already now Warlord Z can't be in any dager of death( he's killed in Courtship of P. Leia). action was ok. The New Republic agent at the end was dumb."
2,Could be a lot lot better !!!!!,"I have read all the other X-Wing books. They were all really good, when I came to read Wraith squadron I was looking forward to it. When I started to read it I was dissapointed it just got worse. With annoying and silly characters. While Corran Horn being slightly annoying yet cool, Kell Tainer is the most annoying demolitions person ever to be in a book. Possibly the best part is where Grinder dies. I hope Iron Fist is better it could not be much worse."
2,Wraith Squadron?,"After reading the first four books in the X-Wing series, I was interested in finding out if there were to be any more. When I found out about Wraith Squadron, I anticipated one worthy of the previous four. This book had spelling and grammar mistakes which made me need to read certain sections four or five times over. The characters weren't as well described as in the prior 4 editions of the X-Wing series and the battles lacked any real passion being written into them. Even at this I have gone out and bought the sequel to Wraith Squadron, ""Iron Fist"" Hoping for a much better book."
3,What A Let Down!,"The story line of this book was very exciting and obviously required much talent on the authors part, but the amount of Star Wars books are growing in number, and the characters with in these books also grow more annoying than possibly imaginable. I'm not sure if it's just me but Kell Tainer is the most irritating, aggrivating annoying batch of rebel scum, demolitions guy ever to be invented. The only way the author could possibly redeem himself would be to kill Kell Tainer and his annoying girlfriend in the most painfull method imaginable and install Myn Donos as the main character. Phew!"
2,I miss Rogue Squadron,"This book was alright but Wraith Squadron can't compare with Rogue Squadron. A few of the characters were ok like Face and Grinder, but they just don't compare to Gavin,Corran and Mirax. Please come back Rogues!!!!!!!"
5,Great job!,"I was worried when I saw that Mike Stackpole wasn't writing this series, but Aaron Allston quickly won me over with his humor. The book stands up to Stackpole's portrayal of X-Wing pilots even without the jokes. Great Job! Yub Yub!"
5,It combines a love story with action and some drama!!,It's an excellent book for young readers that like adventuresome books. Or even a person who enjoys a good story line. I would recomend this book for any star wars fans. Even if your not a star wars fan now you will be after reading this book!!
