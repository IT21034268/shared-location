1,Not Mozarts Requiem,"I do not own, nor intend to purchase this soundtrack. I am writing this review for what is missing from the soundtrack rather than what is present. As has been mentioned in the other reviews, in the beginning of the film, the third part of Mozart's Requiem ""Dies Irae"" was played. Why is this not present on the soundtrack? I can only site this as yet another example of the musical degradation of our society. On rare occasions truly great pieces of music are inserted into popular movies for the very reason that they elicit strong responses on both an intellectual and emotional level. Yet these wonderful pieces of music rarely appear on the soundtracks because they are not ""popular."" I suggest that you retaliate against this by buying Mozart's Requiem instead of this soundtrack. You will find in more rewarding on all levels."
3,Satisfying orchestral score up to repeated listenings,"A solid eighties-style summer movie orchestral score, the X2 soundtrack is laced with satisfying big themes, small themes, action cues, romantic stuff, and assorted little surprises. There's nothing really groundbreaking here, and much that is derivative (James Horner's stuff came to mind at several points), but in the end it all works and makes for an entertaining CD."
2,Gaaaagh!! As bland as they come.,"I found the music for the first X-MEN movie to be great, creating a distinct sound and feel for the X-Men universe. Sadly, it's also one of the most underrated scores I know of. However, it's made all the better when compared to the second installment's music. Though I wouldn't necessarily call it ""bad"", it just doesn't offer anything ""good"", (much like the score for HULK). That said, it appropriately propels the action scenes with force and power (not dramatic power, mind you). But other than that, there's nothing to offer, and that attempt to re-do the awesome theme created by Michael Kamen for the first film truly sucks. I'm looking forward to seeing PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, one action blockbuster with some good music for a change during this summer of disappointing flicks and equally disappointing music.P.S. The actual movie X2 was incredible, easily on any list of the all-time greatest superhero films."
3,needs mixing,The vox are mixed WAAYY too low. It's hard to catch the lyrics. Needs to be mixed with a better vocal balance.
4,excellent book,"excellent, well written, well described experiment, mostly about the superior colliculus, not that much on cortex."
1,Used it since 2008.,"This is pure garbage and that's when it actually works. It's slow, freezes all the time, loses data and server info constantly, not secure at all...hey it's like windows."
5,Over The Top RULES!,If I had to choose a movie that inspires me to find a way to push through it is OVer THE TOp. I love the music in this movie! I was little when this movie came out and its one of my favorite movies. Also the way Stallone jacks fools up with his crazy arm wrestling finisher.
4,movie lover,My son in law loves this movie. He has been looking for it a long time. I was very glad to see it on amazon at a great price. It was a great surprise for his birthday.
4,"I'll put you in a world of hurt, Hawk","This is a great movie and like someone said, it's ABOUT TIME it's available on DVD! It's a great father-son movie... too bad I have a daughter."
2,Sure its bad,The plot is crazy the kid is annoying but you can kind of cheer for the hero...and at least we don't see any shots of Stallone in a diaper. We have to wait for Stop! Or my mom will shoot (the great epic of 1992) for that.
5,took way to long,It's about time they released this. I've been waiting for this for a long time. Now the wizard has to come out on dvd and my life will be complete.
1,Stallone - Arm Wrestling - YAWN!,"I tried to think up a sport that was more boring to make an action picture out of than arm-wrestling; I couldn't think of any. In all honesty, even ""Searching For Bobby Fisher"", (A movie about chess.), was more action packed than this. Even a game of 'rock, paper, scissors' has more arm movements than arm-wrestling! So, the only thing I can think of that is more boring than arm-wrestling is a blinking contest: ""ADREEAAAAN!! I DIDN'T BLINNNK!!"""
3,Step Back To the 80s,This was gift.....it was also a trip back in time. Saw this going up and I do have to say its still pretty cool. Got it in plenty of time.
3,"Sly is not bad in here at all, plus Cheap Trick's Robin Zander on the soundtrack!","Years before the very fine 'Robin Zander'solo effort (Interscope disks, cassettes,'93) this very underrated song, ""In ThisCountry"", which Cheap Trick used to playLIVE on some Japan concerts (I had it onceon VHS, from LIVE in Japan '92, a bootleg,naturally!). Oh...the movie. Stallone ispretty good as arm-wrestling truck driverdespite typical Golan-Globus lowbudgetsetting. Better than Rambo II or III!"
3,Average,This film is by far the most unknown of all time......but also a great idea from a superb director......who thought a film about arm wrestling would have been so unpopular?? Stallone is brilliant as a crazy truck driving arm wrestling hulk of a man.A good script gives this film a great rating
3,an 80's classic,"one of my favorite films growing up in the 80's. It dosn't have the same effect on me now that i am 24,but still a good movie.Stallones best role other than Rocky or Rambo"
5,The emotional drama of a child custody hearing with the suspense and intensity of arm wrestling,"Whoa, hey! Hey, remember that movie ""Kramer vs. Kramer""? Yeah, that was about child custody, too. Yeah, but it wasn't that good. I don't know, it was missing something, you know? Ah, what was it missing? I can't.. oh, wait! I know! Arm wrestling!"
4,Blu-ray is an upgrade,"I didn't really think this movie looked all that great on blu-ray until I popped in the regular DVD again for a comparison. The verdict - the standard DVD looks like garbage compared to the blu-ray. There is a noticeable improvement in the entire movie and certain scenes are vastly improved. Sound quality is improved, but nothing drastic...not that you would expect to be impressed by the sound in Over the Top. No features to speak of, but it's probably because they don't exist and not because Warners is holding out on us and will someday try to make everyone buy Over the Top: Extreme Ultimate Edition. Bottom line is that you might not play this movie and be instantly blown away by the quality, but taking into account how old it is and what the standard DVD looked like, it is worth the upgrade."
2,"No setup capabilities, etc","There is no setup capabilities for problem solving or error correction. The pieces are a trifle small for my tastes. The bishop, queen and rook pieces are too similar, especially the bishop which has a flat top, in my opinion it should be pointed, queen is second worse, rook is actually not to bad.Saitek CH03 Travel Chess Computer Game w/ 64 Playing Levels & 11 Teach Modes"
1,Misrepresented and disappointing,"First of all, this lamp is not made by Hunter. It is an off-brand. It looks very little like the picture shown. The shade is easily twice the size as the one shown, the measurement given for overall height is correct, but the shade hangs at 4 feet. Sitting in a chair the light sits on top of your head, literally. The lamp arc is nearly as wide as it is high. Placing the base of the light half the room away. It is very awkward. I purchased on the Friday Sale for $59. Now that I have it, I wouldn't pay $5 for it. It is heavy and I'm sure it will cost me a fortune to ship back, but I regret this purchase and urge you to think twice before purchasing this."
2,Cheap quality. Goes to quick from one scene to the next. Poor sound.,I had high hopes for this DVD but was very disappointed with the quality. It's like an amateur video. A lot of it goes from scene to scene very quickly. When you see some of the characters from the past you only see them for a second or two only. The sound is bad and a lot of times goes way up then way down. It was nice to see the past characters and scenes from the beginning of the show up to 2002 but was hard to enjoy with the poor quality. It could have been done much better. I sure expected better from Biography.
1,Boring,I purchased this as a present for my mother yet even she couldn't sit and watch very boring backstage documentary. If you're interested in wardrobe etc you may enjoy.
3,Not bad,"I have had this Juicer for a month now. I use it a lot. I will give the pros and cons of this productPros:#1.Since it is a vertical machine it is a great space saver for limited spaces.#2.It takes about 5 minutes to cleanCons:#1.You can only make about two glasses of juice before you have to clean the machine to remove all the pulp and fiber in order to make some more.#2.It has a hard time going through beets.#3.Everything that goes into it doesn't always get juiced.Some of the veggies bounce off the blades and go into the fiber container without extracting all of it's juice.It's a good basic machine. The design is smart but it does take away from getting the most out of juicing each veggie or fruit.=) Live, Laugh, and Love.. Peace, joy, happiness, health, & wealth."
3,The better of less expensive juicers,"Ultimately, I returned this juicer, preferring my more powerful Omega 4000 juicer to it. My Omega seemed too bulky for an occasional glass of juice, so I bought this one hoping it would be compact and simpler to clean. The design is fairly efficient, but the juicer is taller than expected. Overall, it's no less bulky than my Omega.The motor sounds whimpy compared to the Omega, but was adequate at juicing. I've owned several inexpensive store juicers in years past and I would recommend this one to the budget-minded.By the way, my six-year old Omega developed a crack in the bowl's plastic rim. The company not only repaired it for free, they modified it to mirror the latest design of that model, replacing over half the parts!"
1,DANGEROUS- plastic and wire screen ended up in drink,"After juicing for years, I purchased this item and it is being RETURNED IMMEDIATELY and I caution everyone to be very wary of this product/ 1st dat no problem- juiced carotts, celery, deseeded apples. 2nd day same ingredients-found small piece of plastic in drink when lip started bleeding! started to disassemble it and found wire screen had 1"" hole in side and plastic pulp containter had 3' side chip- which I must have drank- only remaining plastic in drink was jagged edge piece about 1/2"" very sharp. WROTE immediately to company who said if I wanted personal reply to my complaint, I had to write to ANOTHER address, did that and got rediredted AGAIN!! This is UNSAFE to use-CAUTION: DO NO BUY!!!"
2,Bad experience,"I used it twice and it worked perfectly, was really fast,produced a high yield of juice from the fruits, easy to set up and simple to clean and also a quite loud. Followed the instructions washed it after each use then when I went to use it again it broke down. Just wouldn't start."
4,Recommend to the Special Ed department at my job. Today's kids are overly medicated and drink the wrong kinds of beverage.,"In the recent years that i have worked with children with special needs i have witnessed that their cravings are to eat and drink ""junk"". I accidently ordered the Breville juicer not knowing that i would receive it as a gift. My plans are to take my juicer to school/work and share by example that a fruit juice is way healthier than any soda,powerade,or gatorade out there. Throught time i should influence someone if not more to drink a healthier beverage."
3,Good for hard fruits and veggies but too messy for leafy greens,"Pros: easy to assemble & use; easy to clean; fast; quietCons: messy, frothy juice; wet pulpI had an omega masticating juicer before this centrifugal one. My biggest complaint with this one is the mess. Since it is a centrifugal one and the motor is spinning, each time you put more veggies/fruits down the shoot, air shoots back up and causes fruit and veggie mess to get all over the kitchen. I mean I have to wipe cabinets. When I had the omega masticating one since it runs off an auger that never happened.If you are just juicing fruits and hard veggies it isn't as bad but if you plan to juice lots of leafy greens or broccoli that have small particles, I would not recommend this juicer."
4,Powerful and efficient juicer,"I've been juicing for many years now with an old, small Hamilton Beach juicer. How did I ever do it?? My old juicer could only accomodate one skinny carrot at a time. The Breville can juice 3 regular size carrots all at the same time. The pulp is much drier than my previous juicer, also. My only complaint isn't really a complaint. I wish I had chosen a juicer that ""spits out"" the pulp into a separate container. I dislike having to empty the pulp container after 1/2 bag (5-lb bag) or so of carrots. However, I knew this juicer didn't offer that feature when I bought it, so I won't actually mark it down for that. It's easy to clean and the pitcher that comes with it is great with the lid that fits under the juicer to eliminate splatter. Overall, an excellent juicer and reasonably priced."
2,Not my first choice,"I bought this juicer after watching the documentary Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead. Joe Cross used a similar juicer be it the more expensive one. I was on a budget so I got the compact juice fountain. I juiced for about 2-days and had to stop because of the inconvience of this juicer. The cup you get to catch your juice is too small if you are going to be a hardcore juicer that I am. In addition to the cup size the pulp catch is so messy that if you are juicing more than 20oz you have to stop take apart the juicer and clean it. Another negative about this product is that the jucie that you get out of it is full of foam and takes 20-min to turn to juice. I beleive this is because of the high speed. One nice thing I liked about this juicer was that it has a large mouth so you can fit a whole apple inside. Unfortunatly for me the cons outweighted the pros so I returned it and bought the Omega Vert HD350. I ended up spending much more money for this new juicer but it was well worth it."
2,LOW CAPACITY AND MESSY CLEAN UP.,"CONS:I could only get about 10oz of juice at a time before having to clean the whole darn thing. No pulp reservoir to hold enough residue.Juice came out with about 40% foamy stuff on top of the juice whichdidn't settle after refrigeration.Cleaning is no fun, you have parts everywhere.PROS: UNIT WAS MADE WELL JUST NEEDS A REDESIGN."
5,Great product,We love it! We received it right away and had no problems putting it together. We've used several times now and we really like it.
2,"Not impressed, get a LeQuip for $20 more.","Ok, it works, there is juice when you are done, but . . .The pulp is mushy, almost slimy meaning this unit is still holding on to a lot of the moisture.The juice you do get has A LOT of froth, not very appetizing.It's got a lot of plastic and it is cloudy after 4 months of use. ICK.Long story short get the LeQuip with a stainless basket, a quieter motor, end up with more juice and less froth.I got this last week and love it.L'Equip 215 XL Wide Mouth Juicer - Black"
2,Disappointed with Breville juicer,"I've been using my Breville juicer for over a year, but I'm very disappointed in its performance. It doesn't juice all the produce I put in the chute and leaves big chunks of vegetables and fruits in the discard bowl. A waste of time and money. It was highly rated and that is why I bought it. I wish I had purchased another juicer like a Champion as I'm very dissatisfied with the Breville juicer."
5,Absolutely the best non commercial juicer,Been using this juicer for a few years now and it does a great job. Juicer has held up really well. Pretty easy to clean and can make enough juice for 3 people np. Highly recommend.
2,Dissappointed.,"After reading all the great reviews I was really excited about this juicer but in my opinion clean up takes too long for the every day juicer. I was also disappointed in the juice quality, which after some more research I see I need a masticating juicer since my priority are leafy greens. That being said, even when I put apples in there it left chunks of untouched apple in there so all in all not the juicer for me, returned it after only one use."
3,Happy but left wanting more,"I am new to juicing and wanted a juicer that would last, be able to fit on my counter without taking up too much room and be easy to clean. Clean up is pretty easy... just don't forget to clean under the basket too. Though this is a good starter juicer, I feel like I could get so much more juice from it. The pulp is pretty wet. I have put it through a paint strainer to get more out of it. For someone who makes a lot of juice at one time, I wouldn't recommend this juicer as the pulp container fills up pretty fast. Also, don't waste your time trying to juice spinach and kale in this machine, it doesn't do much at all. Overall, I like this juicer. It does well for price I paid for it ($99). But I do plan on upgrading soon."
4,Great starter juicer,"I've had my Breville BJE2ooXL for 8 months now and I love it. I absolutely recommend this juicer, it's working just as good as it did on day one - no problems whatsoever and it gets used daily. Quality at an affordable price..."
5,The Breville Compact is Great,"This juicer is worth every dollar I paid for it. Its very easy to use and clean up is not too bad. I live in an apartment in NYC and it fits nicely on my countertop next to my blender, bur grinder, coffee maker and toaster oven."
2,leaky machine,"First:This machine has a handle attached to the main body, the attaching points can leak out juice and make a mess.Second:The after spin fruit body comes out lumpy. This means the machine is not spinning fast enough to get the juice out----Waste a lot of juice."
2,Did not last,"This juicer worked great for two years. I used it on average once a week. Then the motor quit. One reason I bought it was because I had read you didn't have to chop the vegetables first. Knowing what I know now, I would have chopped the vegetables first to prolong the use of this machine.Also, it was not the easiest device to clean."
3,Wish I would have done more research....,"Breville is a great product. Any juicer in this price range would probably perform in the same manner. My disappointment is in the ""waste"". The operation forces out too much pulp. A better product for my needs would have been one that crushes the item...not a centrifugal juicer like this one. If you are only juicing one/twice a week this may not be a bad idea, but I juice twice a day and can't with this product."
4,Bonus for your furry friend,"I have owned mine for a little over a year. The only downside for me is that producing and discarding all of the pulp seemed so wasteful. I rarely give my dogs table scraps, but tonight I was making myself a carrot/apple drink and noticed my two Shih-Tzu mixes were watching with anticipation. As it was already their dinner time, I decided to try serving each of them a generous dollop of the pulp mixed in with their crunchers. Wow! You would have thought I was serving them ground round. They licked up every scrap and pushed their bowels around for 5 minutes more. I'm going to double check all the other fruits and veggies I use to make certain they are safe for dogs to consume - but I suspect they may start enjoying the sound of the blender as much as that of the electric can opener."
3,It definitely makes juice!,"Take 2 carrots, 2 pears, 1 peeled lime and a handful of ice, and you have a delicious juice. Same if you take one beet, pear, carrot; or a couple of red, ripe tomatoes, a whole head of fennel, a cucumber. The point of adding the lime or lemon is to add some Vit C and to sharpen the taste. The machine works quickly and does what it's supposed to. I wish there was a better waste collection system and if you're not fast enough covering the open drop chute you will wind up wiping carrot and beet juice off your counter and stove and refrigerator (if you have a small kitchen like me). But I do love the juice and tomorrow I'm headed for the farmers market for fresh ingredients. The machine takes up a lot of counter space; ditto for the dishwasher, so you're better off washing it by hand. One more thing, instead of using the measuring cup that come with it, I use a tall, plastic take-out container for soup. It's way neater and avoid splashes everywhere."
5,Great compact juicer!,"I inherited another ""no name"" compact juicer prior to my Breville and was disappointed in the amount of juice extracted from those expensive organic fruits and vegetables. The Breville juicer is awesome and packs a lot of power. You will be thrilled with the juice extracted, the cleanup and the price! When feeding the fruits and vegetables through the chute, use the manufacturers suggestion and feed it through slowly. This eliminates the big chunks of food that don't get extracted. Other than that, this juicer comes highly recommended! Update: I've been using this juicer for over a yr now and am still very pleased although I notice I now have to cut up lemons into smaller pieces otherwise ill have a big mess. Other than that my juicer is still going strong."
4,Works great,"The one thing I would have liked is more information on green smoothies and working with vegetables, not only fruits."
3,Messier than I thought it would be,"This was my first juicer. Im not sure if all juicers are this messy but, from the reviews, I thought it would be cleaner.The spinning of the filter motor creates a slight wind tunnel in the chamber which blows specs of the pulp out the top of the feed chute. I wish they could have designed it to be more of a vacuum which sucks air in through the top instead of blowing it out. Instead, small specs of pulp fly out before you have a chance to insert the food pusher (milliseconds) and after you insert the food pusher, as the food pusher does not completely cover the diameter of the chute.Other than that, no probs."
5,Back to buy another!,"I bought this juicer for my boyfriend for Christmas. We have enjoyed it so much, that I am buying one for me. We are both very pleased with the output. The pulp is fairly dry (pasty?).. we've even come up with a great muffin recipe using the fruit pulp.I was amazed at how little noise it makes and how easy the clean-up is. The screen takes a bit of effort, but once you realize how to effectively use the cleaning brush (concentrate on the outside of the screen), even that is nothing!Very powerful, and yes, as some others have said.. when adding smaller berries and grapes, be prepared to shield the opening with your hand right away.Very happy customers!"
5,Great Investment! best juicer ever,We bought a Breville BJE200xl and absolutely love it!!!!! My husband and I were on day 6 of our 10 day juice fasting and my juicer broke. It was a Jack Lalanne juicer and had 6 years of heavy usage. My family believes in holistic healing and have been juicing for years to cure common ailments. We had a few brands of juicers in the family and the Jack la lanne was the favorite. My husband did some consumer research and scanned the reviews here at Amazon and was convinced that we needed to upgrade to a Breville.We are so impressed. It is much easier to clean compared to jacks juicer. It also makes more juice. my average juicing time takes 15 minutes and that includes halving apples and carrots And taking apart and washing juicer.I highly recommend any of the Breville juicers. Happy juicing!! One hint though keep your hand over the top so stuff doesn't spit out. Its very minor and we still love it!
5,This is great!,"This is the first juicer I bought so I didn't really know what to expect. I love this machine. It's so easy. The whole top is clear, so you can see exactly what it's doing. Clean up is just a quick rinse except the basket needs a little scrubbing with the brush. Once in a while a chunk will pass through into the ground waste, to me that's not a big deal. I wasn't sure how it would do with leafy greens, but seems to be fine. Since I've been juicing I feel better and have more energy. For the price, I think this is a good deal."
4,Easy and POWERFUL!,"Just got this machine tonight and juiced up some oranges and apples. The fruit vanishes, and the pulp is pretty dry. From what I understand from reading the reviews of juicers, orange juice is pretty foamy, I just strain it thru cheesecloth.Clean up was easy, about 5 minutes total. By the time I'd finished cleaning up, the foamy oj had strained thru the cheesecloth, and, boy, was it GOOD!The machine isn't loud, no louder than a blender. No vibration, it fits together well, seems pretty darn sturdy. So far, I'm loving it. Only 4 stars since this is my first night with the thing."
4,Great juicer but messy like some say,"I've used it twice so far and do notice that it can be messy. I recommend keeping a towel handy, especially near the spigot where the juice pours in to the cup. With smaller fruit/vegetables, I notice that some pulp blew back out the insertion tube at me. It was minimal and not a big deal."
1,Broke after first use...,"I was so excited to use this product. I read the manual, followed the directions, and cleaning instructions. I used this product once and it no longer worked. I did receive a replacement...I hope the replacement will prove to be a better product."
4,Get lots of juice,Really like using this juicer. Though I wish it was easier to get the left over fruit pulp into the garbage.
3,annoying to clean,Nice inexpensive juicer and it works well but doesn't juice ginger and bananas. Annoying! Worth the cost though.Juicing 101 indeed.
5,BEST JUICER EVER!!,"This juicer is incredibly powerful and easy to use. Cleanup is a breeze, and it manages to release a LOT of juice. Incredible craftsmanship, the little details will amaze you. The blades and pulp net are incredibly sharp and well put together. The little spout on the main pulp bay makes cleanup very simple and the foam collector is great for keeping the foam out of your drink! I make a great little recipe: 3 carrots, 2 large celery sticks, 1 whole apple and 3-4 strawberries. Great tasting and VERY nutritious!!!"
4,Great Juicer,I found this juicer to be quite sturdy and solid all the while still being compact and taking up little space on my counter. No issues juicing anything and do feel as though I get maximum juice out of my fruits and vegetables. Great addition to any house trying to eat healthier.
5,Great buy!,"I've only had this juicer for about a month (and it is my first juicer so I have no comparison) but it has successfully juiced a variety of vegetables (sweet potato, celery, cuccumber, bell pepper, etc).....It seems like a reasonable amount of juice. It is really easy to clean/maintain."
5,"Juicing more, enjoying it more!","I've been juicing many years, off and on. When off, it's because my Green Star is such a slow pain to load and clean that I find excuses. I recently watched Dan McDonald (The Life Regenerator on Youtube) demonstrate this compact Breville to teach uninitiated high school students how easy and cool juicing can be. A light went on. For about $100 I'm back! Often I just want a carrot/apple/celery juice or a celery/beet or a celery/carrot/ginger. If you love juicing I think the two machines work magic together. When I want heavy duty green (No, the Breville is not a green machine but it will do a little spinach rolled into a cigar or, ditto, romaine, etc.), on goes the Green Star--more often now that I'm experiencing juicing's cell-rejuvenating results. For everyday workday, 6 minutes to juice and clean up (yes, really), I crank up the Breville. Easy, reasonably priced, compact for the counter, attractive, and did I say EASY? I'm in juice heaven...it's fun again!"
4,Good but a little pricey,"I've been looking for a good juicer for a little while now and this one seemed to fit my needs. The high wattage ensured good power for a variety of fruits and the assembly, based on all of the reviews here, sounded sturdy and fitting of the price tag. I also appreciated the compactness of the juicer to make sure I'd leave it on my counter and get more use out of it. Larger appliances tend to get stuffed away for a cleaner counter space and better overall look.Overall I give this juicer 3 out of 4 stars. It's good but seems a little pricey for some of the components used.2 stars: Does the job well but does make a bit of a racket while working, mostly due to that 700w motor.1 stars: Components are overall pretty solid but the housing rattles a bit and the motor has a defined burning smell, making me suspect the overall durability.1 stars: Cleaning the kit is easy enough but not as easy as it could have been with just a little more design thought."
4,Breville BJE200XL better than hoped!,"The juicer works great! We've been using it for a month...everyday, and my only complaint is in order to get the most juice out of the produce I need to dump the pulp and clean the filter basket in between glasses of juice for maximum results. It isn't hard, just takes slightly longer. Other than that no problems. Never had a big mess on the counter (unlike some pictures I saw online) because all it takes is keeping the juice catcher under the spout...not a difficult task! Another big plus is everything is top shelf dishwasher safe, and you can't beat the price! Overall, I'd give it a 4.5."
5,Absolutely Beautiful!,This is a very high quality piece of machinery. It really isnice looking and solid. Easy to clean. Comes with a great brush/spatulato clean the pulp. It's not noisy at all.I love it!
4,Good Juicer,"I am very pleased with this juicer. Sometimes it leaves larger pieces of the fruit or vegetable, but I am still pleased. Easy to use and clean. Produces LOTS of juice."
4,Takes time to clean.......,"The motor is very fast, when putting in product the unit will spit back as the directions indicate that the motor must be on. Also cleaning the unit takes some time, especially the mesh screen. With the limited use so far, the unit is functioning OK."
2,Disappointed 1st time juicer,"The 1st one that I bought broke on the 1st day! The blade spun completely out of control and broke the mesh strainer and the pulp holder. It was pretty scary. Thankfully Amazon gave me a refund and I decided that it had to be a freak accident, because of all the great reviews. So, I bought the exact same unit. I was very careful with this 2nd juicer, but I was always a little fearful that it was going to happen again because of the sounds that the machine made. After a few weeks of juicing (a few days a week), the blade got dull (causing me to have to ram/jam the food down the chute, and then thing that pushes the food down the chute started to shred at the bottom. Thank goodness that Amazon is extremely helpful with returns. I returned the 2nd unit too. I loved the juice, but maybe the engine and blades weren't powerful enough."
3,Great....but!,"Help - how to get the pulp out of the mesh seam area. The juice was wonderful. Easy to take the machine apart, but that seam area is impossible to get clean. Any ideas, please!"
4,Great Juicer!,"I haven't used my juicer yet. HOWEVER, everyone I know who has one LOVES it and, one of the reasons I got it is because almost all the reviews were positive and even better than the bigger juicer of the same brand."
2,Was going to return it but forgot it in my car for three months,"The unit works moderately well but doesn't ""chew"" the food up enough and you get a lot of waste, which in this day and age with the cost of food is maddening. Its also a bit difficult to clean. I think we should have just paid more and got a better one. Now this is going to make a very nice gift for someone else."
3,Worked well until it didnt,"The juicer does as advertised and worked well until recently. Ive had it for a year and for some reason it wont turn on. It may just be a defective part. Ive contacted Breville and have yet to hear back.My only complaints while it worked are the foam it creates and the plastic gets discolored. I paid $150 and perhaps the cheaper parts are to be expected at that price. The positives are easy to operate and easy to clean, and the blade is powerful enough do I was never concerned about foid getting stuck."
5,Great Juicer!!!,"I don't know about other readers, but seeing a few of the negative experiences from some of the users did make me a little cautious about purchasing this product. The comments about the clear to grey plastic having leakage/cleaning problems and the other one about issues with clothing getting soiled while using this product has no merit in my experiences. If you are one of the very few that has a problem with plastic seam leakage, call Breville and they will replace it ( I had no problem in inquiring about this limited issue with customer service). How people have clothing issues using the product simply doesn't make sense . . . if you use the juicer as it is designed, it works great! I clean the Breville parts ""thoroughly"" in hot soapy water right after use . . . which takes me about 5 - 7 minutes. Afterwards, I enjoy my juice!Follow up: After several months of use, this is still one great juicer!"
3,WHAT DO WE DO WITH ALL THAT FLIPPING PULP ....,"This is a powerful little juicer and I'm elated that I picked it up a few weeks back for only $99 on Amazon. The thing is FAST and STRONG. Stuff flies out of the top on occasion, probably because it's a worker. The only reason that I'm giving it 3 stars (and this could be the issue with ALL juicers) is that it takes a lot of fruit/veggies to make a glass of juice ... and then you have a COLOSSAL amount of pulp left over. Now I've read that we are supposed to use this as pulp as compost, but we don't have a garden ... so? Guess we can take a spoon and eat the stuff, but we're talking a ""shovel-sized"" amount of pulp, left over. It seems crazy to waste. I don't know. Is this what is wasted to make all the swanky juices in the store? ... as you can see, I just can't get past all the wasted PULP! I mean it's still juicy pulp - so is the machine getting all the juice? Do all juicers waste all that?"
4,Really Enjoy!,This is the first juicer I have purchased and I really enjoy it. I will say it is a little loud once you start putting certain foods in such as carrots and apples for it to juice. The one drawback that is that it doesn't have a separate bin that it separates the pulp in where you can add a plastic bag to make an easy clean-up. Which isn't a huge deal but you will want to make sure you clean the machine right after using it so that you get all of the food bits out before they dry. Other than that I have never had a problem with food flying out at me or with bits of food in my juice. Just make sure that you are entering the foods slowly.
4,Juicer,"Love the juicer. The only thing I dont love about it is that the juicer seems to struggle with beets, but it still ends up juicing them fine. I normally juice carrots, berries, celery, beets and ginger. I read some peoples reviews that this juicer is hard to clean, I personally think its easier than any of the other juicers I have ever owned. Good purchase, I use mine almost daily, sometimes more."
5,A great first juicer!,"This is our first juicer and we're all quite pleased. It's so simple to set up, use, and clean. We had to buy another strainer (my dad doesn't like pulp) but none of the others seemed to mind. Highly recommend this product."
1,"Description Incorrect: NOT 750 Watt, NOT Chrome","Breville does in fact manufacture two versions of this model -- a 700 watt gray plastic exterior version and a 750 watt chrome exterior version. That's why I ordered this version, which is a few dollars more expensive than another listing on Amazon for a 700 watt version.However, I received the item and the product title is completely incorrect; this item is NOT chrome. Second, the product description above is also completely incorrect: it is NOT 750. I have contacted JR and they are accepting my return; they now need to correct this Amazon listing."
2,too much froth,Bought this juicer thinking that it would be really ideal for making juices. It produces too much froth and the juice does not taste good. Moreover it is clumsy to clean. Would not recommend to anyone.
5,Great Juicer,"The Breville Juicer is a great machine. It is easy to use and easy to clean up. The one small item is that it is a challenge to put the fruit and veggies in while it is on with out having some splatter Not much but, it is there. I just use my hand to cover the opening while putting items in. Highly recommend this item."
5,EXCELLENT JUICER,"I don't have a lot of experience with juicers but I wanted a product that would be good for a beginner and easy to operate with minimal cleanup and I got all that and more with this Compact Juice Fountain. It isn't a small appliance so I did have to find a place to store it on my counter because I didn't want to have to get it in and out of a cabinet which I'm sure would affect my juicing time. This machine is great. I've had no problems and have juiced every day since I received it about a month ago. I juice and immediately clean the machine of pulp and drop it in some hot sudsy water, enjoy my juice and clean the machine, dry and ready it for the next time. I would suggest this juicer for anyone who is just getting into juicing I literally can't wait to try new combinations daily."
5,An absolutely amazing Juicer,"I bought this juicer over a year ago and it still looks new not to mention functions the same way it did on the very first day. It is pretty simple to assemble and clean up is a breeze. I had a Jack Lalane juicer before I bought this one and in my opinion, this Breville juicer is far superior when it comes to speed and amount. The feeding tube was mistakenly put into the dishwasher which cause it to enlarge. A quick email to Breville customer service and they shipped another one to me at NO cost."
5,"Easy to use, easy clean up!","This is the first juicer I've owned, so I have no reference point. After research, Breville seemed to be a favorite for many and I can see why! It's very user friendly, makes great juice and clean up takes no time at all, espeically with the brush it comes with for the screen. The safety latch is nice and secure. It's a simple, and great machine. I definitely suggest trying it, great for the price."
3,It is fine so far.,It does not seem to make as much juice as I would have thought but it seems to work so far.
4,Great juicer,This is a great juicer! It's powerful and easy to clean and it's not so huge that I can't leave it out on my counter. I am giving it a lot of use. I do wish they would have added the slower speed on this more economical model though.
3,Breville Juicer,"So far i have used the machine 3 times. The first use (for carrots only) was great. I was very pleased that the pulp came out very dry. The second time was less satisfying as the pulp is kinda wet and also i found large pieces of carrots in the pulp. The third time use was even worse, this time i mixed the carrots with apples and pears. First of all, the pulp came out very wet, there are many large pieces or chunks of apples and carrots in the pulp. I tried to pick them out and rerun the machine, but didn't help, the large pieces still went to the pulp container. This is rather wasting to me so i don't think it will be used much in future. For the price i paid, i don't think i will recommand it."
5,Love the juicer,"for the price this is a great juicer, would buy it again, have been using it for a while now and it is a great product."
4,Gift for my parents.,"Bought this for my folks for xmas and from what I've heard it doesn't produce much juice -- but that could just be because they don't know how to use it properly (?) -- hard to give an accurate review because I haven't actually used it. We have a 1,200 watt Breville that is amazing -- I'm sure this is a great juicer as well."
5,GOOD PRICE,"TWO APPLE FOR ONE CUP OF JUICE, BUT STILL GOOD FOR THIS PRICE , I FEEL HARD TO WASH THE INSIDE METAL GAUZE ELEMENT......."
1,RETURNED THE NEXT DAY,wanted soooo badly to love this juicer...shot out liquid EVERYWHERE! Should have heeded the advise of that other review. such a bummer since I usually adore Breville!
1,Broke after using it twice after owning it for 9 months,"I only used this juicer a few times. It made a large mess and all the ""good stuff"" does not get added to the juice. I hear the bullet is way easier to clean and all parts of the fruit and veggies that are healthy are added to the juice.And...I recently tried using this juicer and it broke down after owning it less than a year. It has a year long warranty, but it will be such a pain to figure out how to return/exchange it."
5,Very Good Juicer,"I bought this as a gift to my boyfriend as our old juicer died. My bf is very happy with the quality of the juicer. He says it definitely beats our old one, plus its a lot easier to use. The cleaning isn't so easy, but not harder than any other one either. Same stuff. You need to take off all the juicing elements and rinse them. So far so good, but both of us are very happy with it and would recommend it gladly!"
4,Best juicer I have used.,"I think this juicer is pretty awesome. It is powerful, not to hard to cleanup, and it even looks cool. My only issue with it is that I feel like it should get a little more juice out of fruits/veggies. Overall I am very satisfied, a lot better then the last 2 juicers I had."
3,Not as good as expected from other reviewers,"This is my first juicer so maybe I just expect too much from my juicer but this one isn't that great. First, as others have described, the fruit/vegetable that is placed inside the chute starts grinding immediately even before you can put the lid stack over it so it sprays juice out. There's a cyclonic wind that comes out of the chute as well so it sprays a little bit when you drop a fruit in.Also, the design isn't very good so large chunks of fruit and vegetables get thrown away. And not very much juice comes out. Not nearly as much as described in the recipes. I am going to upgrade to a better one. Or perhaps buy a food processor so I can eat the whole fruit as well."
4,The best home juicer for the money,"The Breville BJE200XL is powerful, well-designed, easy to use, and easy to clean. I did not give it five stars because I would have liked its capacity for holding pulp to be greater. As it is, I have to remove the pulp more often than I would like, but this is a minor point compared to the other fine features and performance."
5,Truly the perfect juicer,"I just got my juicer and am so pleasantly surprised. I had a juicer a couple of years and I loved it but I had hated how big it was and the pain it was to clean. Plus I didn't like how there was a separate compartment for the pulp. The Breville compact juicer is the perfect size (in my opinion) and I love how the compartment to capture the pulp is contained within the unit.It is super super powerful and the pitcher is fantastically designed to capture the foam when you pour! Another nice aspect my old juicer didn't have. Cleaning took about 5 minutes, not bad at all. Highly recommend!!!"
5,Works so well I bought another,"In addition to making great juice, this is a very well engineered product. It is easy to dissassemble and clean, and it even the cord has been designed to be easily removed from an outlet when the time comes. We like this juicer so much that I bought one for my parents as well."
4,Works great so far!,"This is my first juicer, so I don't have anything to compare to. But I think it is a good one for sure, especially for the money. It is very easy to take apart, clean, and put back together. The juice it makes is awesome, and I use the pulp for recipes sometimes or put it in the compost. The pulp is a little wetter that I expected, and I'm sure the more expensive juicers get more juice out, but overall I think it does a great job."
5,powerful juicer,We had bought the professional Breville juicer for our home and our son wanted one. We could not afford the 500.00 price tag. We got this one for him and it wokrs great. He loves it and it is powerful enough to do all of his juicing. cleans up very easy even though it does not have the bucket that ours has. Great product and I would recommend it.
3,"Decent affordable juicer, but a bit of a pain","Bought this juicer a little over a month ago, and while it's not bad for an intro juicer, there's a number of problems I see with it. First up, this thing causes a heck of a mess. No matter how hard I try to cover the top, and sneak things into the chute, particles of food fly everywhere. Second, I've noticed that sizable chunks of food end up getting kicked to the pulp section, thus limiting its efficiency. Also, the pulp is still rather moist when I remove it. I know it's difficult to remove all moisture, but I shouldn't be able to extract juice by gently squeezing the pulp.All in all, not terrible for a relatively affordable juicer, but if you know you're going to take juicing very seriously, I would opt for a different juicer that addresses those two major flaws."
5,First Juicer,"This is the first juicer I have ever bought and I am so glad that I went with the Breville. I haven't juiced before, but would buy fresh green juices at the farmers market for $$$. I had to stop buying them because I couldn't handle 1 ingredient in the mixture, so I decided to start making my own blend.This juicer is easy to use, and not hard to keep clean. I am very happy with it. The brush that comes with the device is a must, because I don't think I would be able to clean the mesh screen as easy without it. The measuring cup fits up just right against the spout.I really like that it isn't a huge size. I live in an old San Diego apartment and like many older apartment, the cupboards above the counter are really low, so tall items don't typically fit there. This machine fits perfectly, and doesn't take up a lot of much needed counter space."
2,"sent back, too much waste, incredible loud","sent back, too much waste, incredible loud, it does cleanup easily but, there is so much waste when you are done, I ended up go to a higher end blender for smoothies"
4,I really enjoy using this juicer but one small problem.,"I will say this is BY FAR one of the BEST juicers I have ever used in my life but it is the FIRST that I have purchased for myself. It is VERY POWERFUL and efficient, so EASY to clean, it really makes juicing a PLEASURE! My only teeny tiny complaint is I wish the ""basket"" that catches the ground up goodness was a little larger so I could make more juice at one time before needing to dump clean and juice again. Perhaps I should of purchased a higher yielding Juicer but Im sure glad I have this little gem.** So if your are looking to make more juice at a time perhaps enough for a day this isn't the juicer for you, but if not its MORE than adequate!!** I've been juicing almost every day since I've received this sweet little gem, Lifes never been sweeter *wink wink*I will update if any hitches come up but so far its been a lovely ride!!"
1,Does not deliver,"I had really high hopes for this juicer, as some of the reviews indicate that people have had great experiences with it. Unfortunately, I was not satisfied with my purchase at all. The juicer makes a huge mess and sprays juice and pulp from the feed chute and does not produce sufficient juice from any fruit or vegetable. The fact that the pulp is contained within the same container as where the juice comes from is inefficient and the internal pulp container and strainer need to be continually cleaned (after almost every vegetable). I was left with big chunks of anything I put in and very little juice. I have returned this and purchased the Hurom slow juicer, which my sister owns and I've used with great success. I recommend that one, despite the hefty price-tag, as it is definitely worth it."
4,Good juicer,"This was my first juicer. Love the juice that it makes, fairly easy clean up. The only thing that irritates me is the stupid rubber stoppers on the bottom of the machine. They are there to keep the machine from moving when it is on, but they keep popping out of place and make the whole thing wobbly. I tried just taking them off but then the machine moves on the counter when it's on. Other than that, I've had it for years with no other issues."
3,Just Okay,"This juicer has a nice design but I found several issues with it. I think it's relatively noisy, the rubber on the bottom to keep it from slipping came off shortly after purchase but more importantly, it just doesn't do a great job, in my opinion. Large pieces of fruits/veggies seem to get 'kicked' off the blade as you push them down with the hopper and into the ring around the outside that collects the pulp without getting juiced thereby creating a lot of wasted produce and not much juice."
2,"splatters everywhere, and not good for fruits","Even with the lid on, and fastened, when juicing with fruit, such as oranges or pineapple, it not only splatters but the juice leaks out through the seal.Not impressed, but will continue to use."
1,Wastes too much fruit,This juicer's grinding basket is open; it juices half of the fruit and spits the other half out into the trough. The design is very poor; one needs to process the unjuiced fruit in a blender with some water in order not to waste half of the fruit. I do not recommend this juicer.
3,Not what I hoped,"This is an okey juicer, but takes forever to clean for the amount of juice it produces. Remember it has only 2 speeds, off and on, and if you are making a large batch, you will have to unload and rinse before finishing your job."
2,Not for me!,I was really excited about this product. I think it may be good for some people. What I didn't like about it are the following:It really makes a pretty big messYou lose much of the vegetables that you are usingIt takes so much more product to make the juice that you would think when you want the ads for this product.
3,Messy juicing,"Not a frequent user, mostly for hard fruits/ vegetables. Plastic parts are wearing very quickly, well I guess that's what you're paying for. The main issue is flying particles off the fruit receptacle during juicing- IMO due to an engineering flaw. Constantly trying to cover with palm while inserting new portion but to no avail- the motor launches it up. Leaves the surrounding area covered with debris, oftentimes even on the ceiling. Buy a lot's of cleaning solutions with this juicer."
2,Overhyped item,"I made my purchase based on the great reviews that this juicer had on Amazon.com and yes, the price was a factor as well.I got mine about 2 years ago. Since the moment I got it I was not impressed. Unfortunately I didn't get too much use out of this juicer. I got discouraged from using it because it was just such a big deal to clean. The opening where the jar and the place where the juice flows to will not be completely tight and some juice will leak. But the biggest thing is this juices will let big pieces go through without getting the juice from them! which is such a waste! (it would happened especially with greens..)the pulp (and the big un juiced junks..)would still be very moist and it really feels like there is more liquid in there that should be going to my jar!Over all I'm not happy with it and I'v tried better, yes for the price it is not too bad but if you think about it you waste so much produce and energy to clean this thing that and extra $50/$100 would be worth it."
3,Not what we thought,"All the reviews I read were right on the mark. this unit waste a lot of the pulp, it is still wet and juicy. we hate cleaning it up, spend more and get a better one."
5,Breville Juice Fountainis top notch,"The Breville Juice Fountain was recommended to me. The recommendation proved to be a good one. The Breville juicer is easy and efficient. Easy to use, easy to clean. My family and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. Good price,too."
3,Does the job but spills and scares my neighbours,"It is pretty good, really extracts the juice, without leaving much leftovers.The drawback is: It spills a lot through the sides, I expected a better grip between the top and bottom part, forcing me to use something to cover the sides if I don't want to paint my kitchen in lively colours. It also wakes up to whole house, even my neighbour came to check what was the noise the first time I used it. I don't recommend it if your main goal is to use it early morning."
5,Love this Juicer.,"I have been looking for a juicer for a while that was easy to clean and does not take up too much kitchen space. This juicer does all that and more. It is compact and can juice most everything that you can juice. I love the juice collector container because it is spill proof and I can store the excess juice in it. While using this appliance it can sound like a miter saw (not chain saw) but I have never heard of a silent juicer. This juicer is powerful and it takes less than 3 minutes to fill the collector container with juice. The ease of cleaning, storage and quality of juice outweighs the noise. I would highly recommend this juicer. I got it for christmas for $79.99. Love it!"
5,"Nice, solid juicer!","Years ago, my mother bought a juicer that, while it worked well, was such a nightmare to clean that she gave it to me and even I rarely used it. Granted, no juicer is truly going to be a 'breeze' to clean, but this one is about as easy as they come. It takes me less than five minutes to clean-up after I use it which means that I've incorporated it into my morning routine! Another plus is that it is reasonably quiet. I'm glad I got it!"
4,Good For the Price,This is a great juicer for the price. I juice at least one meal a day sometimes two or three. This juicer gets most of the juice out of fruits and veggies. The breakdown is simple and it is relatively easy to clean. I reccomend this juicer for beginner juicers on a budget.
3,"OK Juicer, not as great as reviews claim","Ok, this is my second juicer, the first one was a Hamilton Beach and didn't extract much juice and left the pulp pretty wet.I bought this juicers after reading all (most) of the amazing reviews bragging about this amazing machine.Well, the cleaning is not easier than any other juicers, at least not for me - the ring shape pulp collector make it hard to reach the pulp to take it out plus that shape doesn't let me use a plastic bag to collect the pulp and then just throw directly in the garbage (that would be one less thing to wash).Does it extract more juice than other juicer? Well, it sure extracts more than my Hamilton Beach. The pulp comes out pretty dry, not totally dry but good enough.The machine comes with a small pitcher that you will learn you HAVE TO use because if you use a regular cup the juice is gonna spray all over you as it comes out with a lot of air pushing the juice out."
2,"Yes this juicer is powerful, too powerful!","Yes this juicer is powerful, too powerful in fact. The motor spins so fast it does not derive an efficient amount of juice, leaving the pulp like applesauce as opposed to being sucked dry (as my previous, cheaper juicer.) Also, particles of fruit fly up as you are entering other pieces of fruit because the motor is so powerful. I no longer find clean up easy when I have to climb on top of the cabinets to wipe the ceiling from fruit that flew up from the juicer. My parents have the Jack Lalane juicer, although a less powerful motor, I find that I derive more juice from the same amount of fruit and I am not crawling on top of the cabinets to wipe the ceiling or wiping fruit particles from underneath the top cabinets. I would recommend a Breville juicer but only their top of the line products, not this compact juice fountain which is relatively cheap for a Breville juicer."
3,It is ok,it look nice and is much quieter but the pulp is fairly wet and I don't like the container for the pulp. Any other juicer I could put a plastic bag in it before I juiced to catch the pulp but I can't with this one. It also spatters the juice even when using the cup provided
1,This juicer fails IMO,"This juicer acts like a volcano and shoots veggies (particularly leafy) all over the place, due to the air blowing out the chute. Additionally the pulp ring really didn't work for me, I was extremely limited by the amount of items I could juice. The next model up my mother purchased and I used, with the pulp side-car, works great. Spend the extra $50 and go one model up."
3,Really wanted to give it more stars but...,"I really wanted to give this machine more than 3 stars, but unfortunately i cannot.Ok, here are the pros - the machine is extremely fast. I mean like REALLY fast. The parts are easy to disassemble and clean. It fits really well on my counter which is pretty small.Cons - because it's so fast, it's very difficult to juice berries and any small pieces of items without it spewing back at you. I also noticed that it leaves pieces of the core of fruit/veg in tact - that's not good; I would want it to juice the whole item. Additionally, it is extremely loud - I don't mind the noise, but if you have persons sleeping in the house or talking on the phone, it can be very annoying."
3,Breville Juicer,"Juicer works great but is very hard to clean unless you have a big diswasher.You'll go broke doing fruit like apples and oranges, but this thing will juice veggies well, good for stuff like carrots."
4,Great secondary juicer for me . . .,"and I use it only when I am away on weekends. Yes - it juices and I cannot complain about the great juice other than it is a little too frothy and oxygenated. It is messier than my BJE510XL (my primary juicer), the pulp container is too small for the amount I juice at one time. These issues are only minor annoyances and I am happy with my purchase.Thankfully this is not my primary juicer. Go for a multispeed with a larger pulp container if your budget can afford it.I write this as a finish a nice tall glass of Nona Cabbage, Carrot, Green Beans, Broccoli, Celery, Radishes and Red Bell Pepper juice!Salud!"
4,great tool for the price.,"Like the juicer, easy to use and clean. Only comment is that the waste builds up fairly quickly, especially because we juice for two of us at a time."
4,I like it,"Not bad for what it is. I would definitely recommended it to friends. Easy to clean and maintain. Although it says compact, size is actually quite large."
4,Great juicer,"Have been using this every other day. Works great, at a great price. Very powerful, and pretty easy to clean."
4,Perfect for vegetable juice,"I've lightly used this device for 3 months. I bought this juicer specifically for making carrot/celery juice, which it does with minimal fuss. To fill the pitcher with juice and clean everything by hand takes approximately 12 minutes with practice.Other than that the machine looks ""okay"" in my kitchen. It isn't fancy, but it's not a an eye sore either.The only cons are that it leaves large fruit chunks when trying to make fruit juice (which I don't care about anyways...) and if the pitcher is loose, it will make a mess everywhere (I recommend putting a kitchen towel beneath the pitcher to make sure it's snug with the main unit)."
4,:),"I received this juicer from my parents in law. Love this product! It is silent, works great and makes incredible juice! I use all the time. I would have bought it myself!"
2,Not so good,I think the idea behind it and the design are nice but it is really hard to clean and it seems kind of flimsy to me. I was really disappointed with the product.
5,Breville BJE200XL 700-watt,love this juicer and it's easy to clean up! it's my first juicer and so far i love it! highly recommend!
4,Breville,I think this juicer works great! The only thing I don't like about it is the cup that catches the juice is kind of small. Other then that I highly recommend the Breville.
4,good juicer,"elegant, well built device. Gets the job done. Cleaning is not that difficult either. I am pleased with this juicer."
5,"Sturdy product, great price!",I got the compact versus the full size because I didn't want to spend too much money. I thought I'd be compromising a little on sturdiness and performance. Not at all! I was very pleasantly surprised when I took the juicer out of the box. It's very well built and so sturdy. It juices well and fast. The clean up is a breeze!!
4,Great product for the price.,"I love my juicer. The fresh juice tastes incredible. This juicer puts out very little (if any) pulp. The pulp can be used for ingredients in yogurt, muffins, pancakes, soup, and many other things. If you have a garden, the pulp can also be used for compost. Using a juicer is a great way to eat healthy and eat delicious food. The only draw back is it takes about 30 - 45 minutes to prepare the fruit/vegetables, juice, and clean. This is a lot of time when you have a busy schedule, and fresh juice can only be stored for a couple days. I have not used it as often as I thought I would just because of the time factor. It's tempting to just grab the Tropicana out of the fridge. However, I have no regrets in purchasing mine. Happy Juicing!"
4,almost perfect,"after a month with my juicer. i love it. i have not used it as much as i would want, but i'm still getting the discipline required to buy the stuff and make the perfect juice for the day.everything works fine. nice design. not too loud. easy cleaning. all about that you can read on other reviews. it is just not perfect for the next reasons:- the juice jar moves from its place if you are not careful enough. by the time you realize, you have spilled enough to get a little upset.- the lid of the juice jar does not lock with the jar. if you forget that, it'll drop while serving. not comfortable either.i know, ...small issues. but considering the good design of everything else, those are easy problems that can be solved by simple design modifications. i hope they fix it for further versions. that'd be the perfect juicer for a 100 bucks."
5,"Eazy to use, eazy to clean, makes great juice quick!","This juicer was being demonstrated in a specialty market. I had the person make me a couple of different juices not so much for taste, but more for the amount of juice I could expect to get from things like carrots and celery. I bought one and I have never second-guessed my decision. The thing is super fast, seems to be very well made, but the aspect I couldn't tell during the demo was how easy it is to clean. After making my juice, I can clean everything in three minutes.My favorite juice is 3 small oranges, one apple, one small carrot, one stalk of celery, and a banana. I split it with my wife. Great! I know I'm going to enjoy this for many years to come."
3,Acceptable,I am dissapointed wuth the amount of juice this juicer produces. I am experimenting with ways to use the pulp. Too much fibre is being wasted other wise. It is easy to use & clean up. It is light in weight & stores easily in a cabinet.
3,Average- its okay,pros are its compact in size so fits my city apt kitchen. its very easy to jucie however the pulp is kinda wet.. it could be drier..the food pusher can be inserted only at a particular angle so its kind of difficult to push the food quickly
4,Works very well just a pain to clean.,Juices foods very well but difficult to clean. We have order a different one to keep a work so we will see if the new one will be easier to clean.
4,Nice Juicer,"This Breville is my first juicer, so I wasn't certain how they worked. It is fast and does a very good job of turning produce into juice. My only wish is that it leaves quite a bit of pulp behind that I would like to see ground down some more and put in the juice. Clean-up is very easy since there are only three parts of the juicer to clean. Overall, an excellent product."
5,"Great, compact and easy to use product","i bought this product after researching most of the juicers in the market. I wanted a middle of the line product and found the BrevilleBJE200XL to be just that.It is a very well designed product and very easy to assemble with just 3 removable parts and as easy to use and clean. If you use the brush as directed it is very easy to clean the mesh. The base is very stable and the parts are easy to attach and remove. The juice collector jar is also a great design.I have used the juicer to juice carrots, pear, apple, pineapple, cantaloupe, beetroot, cilantro, grapes etc.Unlike other reviewers who had bad experience with the product I was able to extract good quantities of juice. As suggested in the manual you need to alternate between soft and hard fruits.I like this product and since I haven't had any problems with it yet I do not have any experience with the customer service.A great compact and easy to use product."
2,Becareful!,The best part of this juicer is the packaging. The unit has sharp edges that could cut your fingers when cleaning. The plastic is cheap leaving stains and scum. There are many other good juicers. Customer Service at Breville has have sharp edges too!
3,I wished I had realized,I wish I had realized how much food residue would be left at the end of the juicing! Way too much in my opinion!
2,Breville,"I am not happy with this product, i was looking for the separate trash container. In past i used Bosch juicer."
2,juicer,"sturdy construction a+, leave alot of wet pulp though -, takes a bunch to make alittle-, hard to clean-, measuring cup +"
1,Doesn't work,"Buyers beware! I do not recommend buying this product online. The motor was dead right out of the box. Thanks alot! I went out and bought a ton of organic veggies and fruits and now they will rot while I wait for a replacement. I wouldn't even give this crappy item one star. Do some quality control before sending out your product. Oh and by the way, Breville's phone number for customer service is out of order. Breville SUCKS!"
1,Yikes?!,I've seen this thing in action and am confused why no one likes the Jack Lalane juicer? I own it and it's awesome. So much easier to clean than this machine. I can get 8 oz of juice from 1 1/2 green apples. Just pathetic that people bought this over the Jack Lalane.
1,Bogus Website,"Went on a website that reviews juicers. I click to order a juicer costing 89.95$ with free shipping and I get rerouted to amazon selling a USED juicer for 91.50$. If I want it new it's anywhere from a 100.00 to 145.00 plus shipping. As a prime member I think this is bogus and misleading. The website reviews best juicers under 100.00$. Come on Amazon, you can do better than that! Is it time to give up my prime?"
1,Breville Juicer,This Juicer is a waste of good hard earned money. It seperates out all of the pulp and just leaves about 1/2 or the fruit or veg's you juice.
2,"Not too efficient, a bit messy","I'm comparing this to a juicer that I have in the UK, which unfortunately isn't available here in the US. This one seems to require a huge amount of product in order to make rather a small amount of juice, so it's expensive to run. Additionally, I find that if you feed the machine with product while it's running, the fruit/veg shoots out of the feeder and covers the kitchen, so there's no way to have it going and feed the product in while its operating. You have to feed each piece in while it's switched off, and then put the plug in the feeder and switch it on. So it's a bit time consuming."
4,Easy to Clean,"After using other juicers I've found this is so easy to clean! 1st step of juice to ending clean-up is about 20 minutes & that's a real plus.Comes apart easily & fits back together like a charm, you have to make sure that the base is pressed firmly into place or you will get a minor leak. I'm using this 2 to 3 times a day & it doesn't get much better... tho I haven't tried one of the $2,000 juicers!Highly recommended to anyone looking to increase their health & start or continue a juicing lifestyle."
4,works great as hyped,"Everything has worked like clockwork (~ 2 months now) and as a result I feel so much healthier. There is a slight hairline crack on the plastic container that collects the mulch so I didn't give it 5 stars. I can tell that with fruits and softer stuff it would be better to have a slower speed, but for a newbie like me it wasn't worth the additional cost for a multi-speed unit. This one does a great job already."
3,So-so,I just bought this the other day.. I thought it would make more juice than it does.. it wastes a lot of juice it basically chops the fruit up into smithereens. There is still a lot of juice not extracted in the pulp. I would buy another one over this one but it is still a nice machine.
3,"so far, so good",For sure it extract juice from fruits and vegetables. But the waist of the pulp is enormous!!! You don't get any fiber in the juice. It is very easy to assemble and to clean.
4,Breville Juicer,"I received my new Breville Juicer within a week from order date. I am new to juicing so borrowed a Jack LaLane from a friend to try it out. After doing some research, mostly reading others reviews, I chose the Breville. It takes up less room and is faster than the other, I had a hard time cleaning the blade at first, but now- using the brush that was included it only takes a couple of minutes to juice, clean and be on my way. I love it."
4,great juicer for the price,"I don't have much experience with juicers but this one seems really good. Juices all kinds of veggies and fruits without effort and leaves behind all the pulp, so you are left with pure juice. It is a little hard to clean but still is a good sturdy machine."
4,Yocasta Reyes,This Breville juicer is very good. I finally enjoy juicing my carrots and my beets especially!!!It takes just a little bit of work to clean.. Way to Go! Good machine!
1,sent it back,"We got this to juice the apples and grapes that grow in our yard. It worked perfectly for one session of apples, but when we tried to do a batch of graps a few days later it stoped working, as in it would not turn on and smelt as if the moter had burnt out, I dont think that grapes with tiny seeds should have done that."
3,Flawed Genius,"I had a Krupps Juicer before. It broke after years of faithful service and I ordered the Breville Compact Juice Fountain. Great design. Very worked out in terms of ease of use, easy clean up, and it looks great on your counter. One example, they include a brush to clean the screen--turn it around and its handle fits the channel in the bowl to clean out the pulp.And, man this thing wrings out the juice with its powerful motor.The 3 star rating is because after using this for 9 or 10 months, it started leaking a small amount each time I juiced. I found that the rubber spout had developed a crack where it joins the bowl. I hadn't treated it roughly in any way.I've ordered a replacement part, but was disappointed to find this otherwise genius design has a serious defect.Has any other owner experienced this?"
4,Breville Juicer,"I already own a Breville tea pot so I knew when looking for a juicer, Breville would be the way to go! Works great and isn't bulky so it can just be left on the counter! Would definately recommend this juicer to anyone! I also love the scrub brush that came with it makes clean up that much easier!"
5,Excellent juicer!,"I used to own the jack lalane juicer, and while it did juice veggies pretty well, it was a terrible mess to clean up. This juicer is very easy to clean, and the increase in power gives me more juice than the lalane did. I love this juicer, and recommend it."
4,Works great!,"This is the first juicer I've owned, so nothing to compare it to, but I really like it. I'm glad it's the ""compact"" size because it's still a pretty large appliance. Very powerful, and surprisingly quiet. Clean up is easy, as long as you do so IMMEDIATELY (don't take a break to drink the juice first... clean it first!) Otherwise, the pulp will dry on like iron. But if you clean it right away it's a breeze. Because it's a compact size, I do find I need to empty the machine fairly often if I want to make a large jug of juice. A minor issue there is that you pretty much have to take the whole machine apart to empty it out. Disassembly is easy, but I do kind of wish the pulp just went out into a separate bin I could empty without disassembling. But if you want to just make a couple glasses at a time, it's just the right size. I don't think you could beat this juicer for the price, it's great for a first time user like me!"
1,Juice for one,"I bought this juicer in August and it worked great in the beginning. As time has gone by and the use has increased the quality of this product has decreased.If you intend to make one 8 oz glass of juice once in a while this is your product. Don't buy this product if you intend to juice a lot, it just isn't of the level of quality you expect when you pay $100 for something."
5,Great starter juicer,"As a terrible cook but voracious absorber of food/nutrients, I found the Breville juicer to be an easy and fun way to infuse healthy eating into my life. Although there are definitely types of produce that the juicer is better at extracting than others (ex. apples, carrots, cucumbers, not as much leafy greens), I have yet to encounter a type of produce it does not extract at all."
1,REPLACEMENT FILTER TOO EXPENSIVE,"I used my Breville BJE200XL for about a year and half - the filter's mesh net then tore.Replacement filters start at $45.Total rip-off.However, the juicer did not break down. But what's the point of having a great juicer and a lousy filter? $45 is too much for a filter that has to be replaced."
2,Disappointing...,"Despite the negative reviews I read here I decided to buy this juicer. First I should mention I have only used it for carrots, which is why I bought it. It did not extract all the juice from the carrots, the juice it did make was very gritty with lots of rather large pieces of carrot in it - in fact there was a fair amount of visible chopped carrot at the bottom of my glass. The wasted pulp - and there was way too much of it - can be frozen and used in soups and stews, and I have many bags of this in my freezer! But I would rather have had more juice, and more liquid juice at that. The best part of this system is the cleaning brush which is very useful. I also like the pitcher, and the fact that it comes apart easily for cleaning. But I am sorry I bought it and consider it a waste of money."
4,Great juicer for the price,"It is the first juicer we bought. The trick is to push the vegetables and fruits really slow- otherwise you get a lots of pulp. Cleaning is relatively easy, except for the strainer basket. Overall I am pretty happy with the purchase- we use it every morning."
4,Breville Juicer,Thi is the 5th juicer I've owned and I really like this one.It does a better job than the others I've used and/or tried. Thanks
4,Great juicer at Great price!,"The juicer works very well and is easy to use! It is a little hard to clean, however I have never owned a juicer, so I am unsure if another would be easier to clean! I would buy this again!"
4,This is a great purchase!,"Easy to use- no need for chopping most vegatables, the chute is quite big. Easy to clean... and very effecient. I am happy with this purchase!"
5,Better than expected!,The Breville Juicer is fantastic! I was worried there would be some disadvantages to getting the cheaper model but I was totally wrong. I don't see why anyone would need a more expensive one!
5,Love it Love it,"This machine is powerful, fast and easy to use. I use it everyday. I love how quickly it produces juice. It is easy to clean. I'm glad the juicer came with a brush. It is very helpful with cleaning the screen. I think the juicer is easy to clean. It takes no time at all to clean. I don't put it in the dishwasher, although it states it is dishwasher safe.Remember to have the juicer turned on before you place the vegetables or fruit in the chute. Read the manual before you use it and you should not have any problems at all. I am glad I brought this model juicer. I read a lot of reviews and this juicer is well worth the money. I really think it is a great deal."
4,"Decent machine, user may be problem","I like this juicer I do (thus the 4 stars). And I realize my ""complaints"" about it may be my problem, not the juicers. But either way, here they are.1) It's loud. 2)Making juice creates a mess all over my kitchen. 3) The juice seems to go ""sour"" after a day, which makes buying cheap fruit (larger quantity) and making lots of juice at once (to minimize clean up) impossible. Which leads to the next complaint . . .4) expense.So basically, if you are a pro at slicing up fruit and you have all the money in the world to buy fresh fruit each morning. Go for it. You'll love this thing!We got it as a Christmas gift, so I definitely won't complain about it being a waste . . . but it spends most its time in our cupboard. Sad face."
4,Breville BJE@200XL Juice Fountain,It is a very good unit for our small family usage. The 700 watt motor has enough power and quiet. We like it.
4,"First juicer, very satisfied.","After researching several juicers in this price range, I chose this one based on people's good reviews about how easy it was to use and take apart. I am very happy with the construction of the product, making it pretty hassle-free to use several times a day. So far it has done a good job with carrots, apples, ginger, celery and leafy greens. The pulp is the texture of playdough without too many missed slices of vegetable. I only wish you could control the speed. It is powerful enough to juice things quickly, but I hear that fast is not necessarily better when it comes to diminishing the nutritional value of the juice. Overall, I think this is a really good buy, assuming that the makers will back any product defects."
5,After ALOT Of research I bought this and it exceeded my expectations!,"I love it! Its everything we need and more! Easy to clean (well, the grater screen requires a bit of scrubbing but Im sure thats common among all juicers- comes with a handy brush just for this)It looks gorgeous on my countertop and juicing is fun because of it.We just started getting into raw foods so I've never owned a juicer before but I read pretty much every consumer report and review and am happy I did because I got exactly what I expected to get and more.This is a great machine with plenty of power and besides the grate the rest of it cleans in a second or two!!!Somebody mentioned it staining in their review and I haven't found that to be true - as long as you rinse it out immediately after making your juice (I do it as Im drinking my juice )"
2,ADVISE from me to AMAZON SHOPPERS is DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"A year ago I bought one from amazon with 100$,and for 2 months I was thinking to buy 2 compact juice fountains for my mother and a friend.I saw that was once 209$!(because of that price I write this review).The product is very good but not the price.I end up buying them from ....... 217$ with tax.Do your research and you will find the product around 99$!"
1,Makes a MESS!!,"So I got this because my friend had gotten it and loved it. After about 5 or 6 times it began to make a mess. I'm not talking about the juice but little pieces pulp everywhere. All over my counter, cabinets, and wall... and it seems like it's increasing every time. Not including I'm getting large pieces of fruit and veggies in with the pulp. It might be that I juice for the day so I juice a large amount at a time. So I have to empty the pulp bin once sometime twice each time. I'm returning the juicer and buying the next one up. I hope that one is better."
2,Spend a little more...,"Yes this is one of the cheapest juicers and it works fine BUT if you are going to use more than once in a while I suggest spending another $10 or $15. The unit has plenty of power and will juice anything your want BUT.. the pulp is kept inside the machine, which is fine if you're making a single glass of juice. If you want more than 16oz of juice you have to shut the juicer down, take the top off, take the blade out, take the receptacle off the stand, empty the pulp and put it all back together in reverse order to continue making juice. What a pain. Juice for one, great.. juice for a few people or for the day.. not so good."
1,leaking juicer,leaks really bad........you can only put in enough fruit and vegetables to do two small glasses then you have to take it apart clean it and start all over again.
1,Not for Professional Juicers!,"First the good: I had a Black & Decker Bigmouth juicer. This Breville seems to extract more juice from fruits and vegetables and does so relatively quietly. However, the B&D has a separate pulp collection component, making it very easy to remove the pulp and keep juicing. This machine does not. That means every four cups you have to clean the pulp out! Not good, and I'm feeling extreme buyer's remorse. I won't send it back since it would cost too much. But if you're doing more than occasional juicing, this is NOT the machine for you."
2,not quite what i expected,"Breville BJE200XL 700-Watt Compact Juice FountainI had expected the juicer to be more efficient. The biggest problem is that it produces a lot of foam (over 1/4 filling the container that comes with the juicer). I had to stop and clean it after only a small amount of apples and the pulp was much soggier than other juicers i have used. i was so disappointed, i have to admit that i have put it away with all the great fantasies about fresh juice in the morning I had when i purchased it."
1,Worst Juicer!! Leaves PULP WET & Chunks of Veggies,"I bought this juicer because of all the good reviews. Like a few other people say: the pulp ends up very wet. The blade runs so fast that it actually does not juice the entire vegetable/fruit; it leaves many pieces unjuiced. I've wasted my money buying this juicer. This juicer is ineffective. I wish I would've bought a different one. It does however clean up fast, so if this is the only thing you care about in a juicer, this is great. Otherwise, it's awful."
5,Absolutely love this juicer,"The price range of this juicer was just right so we thought we'd give it a try. It has worked out very well. It extremely easy to use, juices in seconds, can juice about anything and it is amazingly easy to clean.I absolutely love this product. Can't say enough good things about it."
3,Doesn't juice fully,"You can actually waste food with this juicer. What I've notice was when you put pear, apple, or anything hard food that's good for juicing, at the very end a piece of the food will fly to the carousel and it made a loud snap sound. I don't think that's normal. The carousel hold all of the waste after juicing. When I remove the waste out of the carousel I can still feel the juice in it.You need to clean this juicer right away to keep it from stain. The little container should be the first thing you should clean because it's where the juice came from. I was planning on returning it for something else, but missed out on the return date.Other then those major problems, it works as it should.I was amazed the first day, but disappointed just a few days after."
1,Lots of pulp little juice,"If you want to grind alot of expensive fruits and vegetables into pulp and eat the pulp, this is the product for you. If you want juice, buy something else."
1,Worked great until it juiced itself.,"Unfortunately I didn't have the juicer long enough to give it a full test, as the second time I went to use the juicer, it proceeded to shred the plastic housing apart, despite being seated/reinstalled properly. Perhaps mine was flawed, but still, I expected the product to not destroy itself on the second use."
4,good juicer overall,"Length:: 0:31 Minsthe juicer is fast, watch the videos i made, but sometimes it is so fast that food flies out from the top as in all juicers, the machine shakes if you put a apple in it and its not gripping against something like a sink, and so the canister where the juice comes out from moves and starts to spill. plus so much air comes out of the juice hole because its spinning so fast that you have to use the canister they provide.cleanup is hard, i have to clean up the counter, the machine, inside 2 parts and the mesh. u should ideally put that into a soil area to make good soil at home. it does get a lot of juice out. who knows if it will last a long time though."
3,not so good,"I purchased this, reading lot of reviews here. However, I am not very satisfied using this. I do lot of veggies and fruits on this machine. Some of them dont go very well with this..such as carrot. I left with small chunks of carrots on the pulp container after I am doing jucing it. Also, the carrot juice sometimes will still have some fine pulp on it, and you can feel it while drinking."
4,Nice under-used kitchen appliance,"It works pretty well, but i dont use it as much as i should. It takes up alot of space too. But it works good. Sometimes it shoots big chunks through without juicing them, but this is rare."
1,Buyer Be Wary,"I was happy with my $99 Breville BJE200Xl the first month of use. I was careful to quarter beets and not use too much pressure on carrots. Second month, I noticed the screen developing several wrinkles, so I called customer service. Oh my aching pain in the ass. ""E-mail us a photograph,"" the lady suggested, ""and we will subject it to analysis."" Her supervisor said the screen is not covered in the warentee anway, ""Read the fine print."" She informed me my only option to buy a new screen for $45.00. Am miffed about that, believing a company should back their products. I did not abuse their fine Italian screen. And I don't want you to suffer the abuse of paying an actual $145 for a product that announces itself as a deal at $99. Or does the screen wrinkle every month? I know this for certain, should the motor go out and you're asking for the supervisor, expect to be put on hold for at least an hour. (Put blunt, Breville's customer service department sucks!)"
1,Bad quality and service,"I brought it less than 3 months, it was totally break down half way I make my daily juicer.....I contact Breville customer service they said it was under warranty. They send me a label code to return my product to them to replace a new one for me. Since beginning of April until now already I haven't get any rely from them when they will replace a new one to me. I had already send them back mine one. One thing make me feel disappointed is if you not replace just let me know,so then I will get a new one.....be honor not play game around...I will not buy any product of they company anymore and will tell all my friends from USA and all foreign country. Bad service and dishonest'Irresponsible. Absolutely not recommend it."
1,Juices < 10% of the veggies,I was so highly disappointed. I bought this juicer because of the good reviews on Amazon- but it basically does not work. Only about 10% of what I put in there juices. Returning this product :P
5,Excellent value for the price,"Easy assembly, not as loud as many, and a fairly quick clean up. I love the pitcher and its lid that skims the foam for the most part when you pour your juice."
4,powerful and easy to clean,"This powerful juicer gets your juice ready in seconds and it is easy to clean. I often use it twice a day and don't mind the cleaning part of it. At the price of a little over one hundred dollars, this one may be the best buy. I sure am happy of the choice I made."
5,This is my first juicer and am very pleased...,"I bought this juicer because of all the great reviews. I rely a lot on reviews when buying on-line. Not disappointed as usual. Product was easy to remove from the box and assemble. Extremely easy to use, has great safety features and is easy to clean. Love it!"
5,Nice buy,"I use it every morning, easy to use. A little hard to clean the basket but I'm very happy with this juice extractor"
4,breville BJE200XL jucer,The best juicer I have ever used. Definitely extracts all the juice out of the fruit or vegitable. easy to clean also.
4,"Great Juice, but too much excess pulp and goop.","I got this juicer to start eating healthy foods and get my daily intake of fruits and veggies. It works. It's awesome viewing the fruit and veggies get murdered in the juicer. My one thing about this juicer is that I wish it didn't create so much pulp and excess veggie and fruit goop. I still get a lot of juice from a few items, but the pulp and excess just seems like a lot to me. Seems like one could get a little more juice out of those parts."
5,Everything I hoped it would be!,This juicer was everything I hoped it would be especially since I never owned a juicer. I have no problem putting green leafy vegetables in it along with fruit etc. My machine does not leak and neither does the dispenser part when the juice is coming out. Machine cleans up very easy.
3,"The Breville ""Pulp Volcano"" - It Juices but decorates my ceiling too.","Like many of you, I watched the documentary about the two fellows who lost a bunch of weight by juicing. Having juiced off and on for several years, I decided to take the plunge and get this juicer. Certainly, it does juice the vegetables and fruit - they go in and juice comes out. The problem lies in that a respectable amount of pulp shoots out the top of the juicer and decorates my counter tops and ceiling. At first my ""monster truck mentality"" was greatly amused and I even issued several ""yee-haws"" but after being assigned clean up duty by my even less-amused wife, I too quickly tired of the mess made while juicing. My correspondence with Breville has been less-than-satisfactory, and I await further response on how to reduce the pulp volcano. If any other owners of this unit have suggestions on pulp control let me know in the comments!!!!"
4,Juicer,"The juicer is simple, seems to get alot of the juice out, but the pulp is still kind of wet. And it, like any juicer, is a headache to clean."
5,Eay to use and clean,"I love this juicer. I am buying one more for my mom. I have no complaints. It is easy to use, the opening is large enough for big chunks of fruits/vegetables, and it is very easy to clean, especially since it includes a nice brush."
4,Works better for veggies than fruit,I bought this juicer because it had really good reviews from Amazon and other sites. Not a bad juicer for the price $100. I never tried the Jack Lalane because it had lots of bad reviews but I wish the brevelle left less pulp behind like Jack's advertises.It's really not good with fruit - even crisp apples - the pulp is very wet afterward. Even with the veggies carrots and beets and the like - I gather the pulp and run it through again - timely but I get a bunch more juice.Clean up isn't bad - it runs through the dishwasher just fine. YOU MUST RINSE ALL THE PIECES FIRST! or you'll get debris all over your other dishes.All in all not bad for $100. At least this way I'm consuming much more veggies than I would without.
3,"quick juicing,easy clean up but wet pulp","After a lot of research I decided to go with Breville.I was looking for something for daily use,within 100 dollars,quick juicing and easy clean up.Well I have not used any other high juicers,so cannot compare with anything else.Well juicing is quick,cleaning is simple,but the pulp is not as dry as advertised(that's why I have given it a 3 star).I feel like I am wasting lot of fruits.May be I will look for some recipes for the extract,so that I don't have to throw my pulp.Well I still would recommend this with a warning ""don't expect dry pulp""drink fresh stay healthy ...well whole fruits are always better,but we all are too lazy to eat 4.5 servings daily(atleast I don't).juicing makes it simple."
4,Great juicer!!,"I bought this juicer about 2 weeks ago and basically have been using it everyday. I have been juicing everything from celery to apples and it has been working great.It does sometimes splatter onto my counter top, but it's rare, usually just with juicy fruit or small items. It is less noisy than my more expensive blender and looks super cool in my kitchen!! Definitely worth buying, especially when looking at the price. The pitcher that is including with it is worth it as well, for it sit directly under the spout (which equals no mess) and can be then transferred right to the fridge."
4,"Delicious juices, easy clean up","As I write this, I am enjoying a deliciously, vibrant apple/fennel/celery juice that I made using the Breville Compact juicer. It's so luxurious to have such delicious treats in the convenience of my own home. I can't believe how good it is -- and I can't believe how long I've paid $7 for juice from the juice store!I'm very pleased with this purchase. This is my first juicer. It is easy to use and the clean up is pretty fast. The basket is a little bit of a hassle to clean -- but it is no big deal.The juicer comes with a few recipes. I am glad that I boughtComplete Book of Juicing: Your Delicious Guide to Youthful Vitalityat the same time. Things are going great so far. I've used the machine about 6 times, I think.For $100, this is a great starter machine. Eventually, I'll probably upgrade to a grinding-type machine. I wasn't sure how much I would juice, though, so I wanted a ""starter"" model. And this is perfect."
4,I enjoy this juicer so much,"For years I wanted to purchase a juicer. I saw a Breville Juicer being used on Dr. Oz, and went to Amazon to see the choices. I read the reviews of this one I purchased and was impressed, and I will have to agree. I am enjoying it so much, and like some of the other reviews mentioned, it is easy to clean. I have had no complaints."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I love this juicer. I bought it to start juicing and live a bit healthier and cleaner lifestyle. Living in NYC is a bit hard to find a large kitchen, so the compact juicer size and easy use is a definite plus. I'd say about 95% of the fruits or veggies that I juice are fully broken down and for the price this is a great deal. When I get a bigger space would definitely consider buying a larger juicer from Breville."
5,OMG I love this!,"the rating 5/5 why because this thing rocks i been using it everyday for one year now...pro's- if you can juice it, it will juice for you. its a good starter juicer for people that are getting in to juicing them selfs..con's- cleaning it but you have to baby those blades tho at least i do. then holding tank for the dry leafs that you juiced somewhat sucks doesn't hold much so you have to clean it out if you're making a lot of juice.but other then that its great its not running slow or anything.keep juicing my friends and be healthy"
3,Decent Juicer,"I purchased this a while ago after watching Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead. It works fairly well. It is a pain to clean. I find that in the midst of juicing I have to stop to clean out the pulp and also the filter and then resume juicing. It gets a good amount of the juice out of what you put in it though. Thinking of getting another model that is a little easier to manage."
4,Yummy!,I've never owned a juicer. What was I thinking?Pros:+ You can juice just about anything. Sweet potatoes? Yep.+ It's hard to juice something that tastes bad. Everything I've made tastes good.+ It's a nutritious tummy-filler unlike snacking on junk food. Duh!+ The design seems perfect. Breaking it down for cleaning is simple and quick.+ You can make stuff up like I did: Pineapple + Celery + Tomato + Apple + Carrots = TASTY! And I have no idea why.Cons:- All of that pulp/skin (aka FIBER) that get's tossed to the side. Surely there must be SOME WAY to avoid wasting it.- Cleaning after each use. Lame! How come they can't invent a self cleaning machine?The only negatives to this product involves the laziness of it's user. It's a great device and works just like it should. I don't know how long the special spinning/juicer thing will last but i'll hope for the best (the manual says that it's very delicate or something and to be careful with it).
5,So easy to use!,"Love my juicer! I got this after watching Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead and wanted to do a juice cleanse. It's easy to use and easy to clean. It seems very powerful and had no problem juicing anything from sweet potatoes to cranberries."
4,Great Juicer,"This is a great juicer! The chute is big enough so you don't have to chop your veggies/fruit, unless it is a really large apple. It has a fast, powerful motor. The clean-up is a big tedious. That is why I only gave it 4 and not 5 stars. I see on other Breville models that they have a different pulp container, one that you can line with a plastic bag to make cleaning easier. I would probably consider that if I ever have to purchase another juice. I would definitely look at another Breville!"
3,low capacity,This juicer has to be taken apart and emptied after every 2 or 3 cups of juice. Slow going and a hassle if you want to make a lot of juice at one time. It's an interesting space saving design and I think it does a good job juicing but the models with the pulp bins are better.
3,Breville 700 watt,"For the price its great, it works as advertised except sometimes I find pieces of fruits in the pulp bean (the reason for 3 stars). Seems to be pretty well built."
3,not the best..,"The juicer was good at first, but not what i expected. When the filter gets too full during juicing, pulp get shot back up at you. When the compartment that holds the pulp gets too full juice starts coming out of the side. It's a very messy product. It doesn't get all the juice that it could because when i dump the pulp out, their is a fair amount of juice everywhere. I would recommend you do your research and look around before purchasing(my own mistake). You get what you pay for basically."
4,Great Value for the price Indeed,Recently Bought this Juicer. For $99.99 I think it is unbeatable value for money.This is my first Juicer so can't compare with any thing else. Cleaning I think is a little difficult ( nothing compared to what I have read in the reviews however). I am ready to work for the healthy benefit that I get out of drinking fresh juice. A comment that is applicable to juicing in general: I have piled up a lot of fiber from all the juicing that i did over the weekend. I think I will have to dump/trash them. You cant go wrong with this juicer. Great Product.
4,"Great Juicer, Tough Cleanup","This juicer had been great for me. I have had it for almost 12 months using it 1-2 times per week and it still is working very well for me. The only challenge I have had (and the reason for the 4 stars) is the basket is more difficult to clean out that I would have liked. They do provide a teriffic brush to help make the job easier, but the total clean-up time still sits around 5-6 minutes which feels long considering the speed at which it juices...this thing is FAST!"
5,Awesome and easy to use/clean,"We just received this yesterday and have already used it several times. We are first time juicers, however we were able to unpackage it, clean it, assemble, and use it very easily. I think that we get a lot of juice out of it. We have put several whole apples in this juicer and had no problems yet. Clean up is super easy...the scraper tool that comes with it is perfect! I am so excited to continue juicing and get healthier. For the price, I think we got a great machine."
5,Very nice product,"I like the juicer and find it works very well. The whole juicer is sometimes time consuming to clean, but I""m happy with the quality and juice it produces."
5,amazing juicer!,i just received this today and i have already used it twice! it is a breeze to clean with the built in pulp collector and the motor is a beast. it pulverizes veggies into submission. i love that the collection cup has a separator to keep the foam out of my juice. this is a wonderful product and definitely worth the money!
3,Not completely satisfied,This juicer works OK but part of the rubber cushioning on the bottom came off right away and now the machine is lopsided. I can't seem to fix it and it's very annoying.
5,"BEST JUICIER FOR THE PRICE, CANT BEAT IT","I bought the Breville at Macy on sale for about $75.00. Didn't use if for a year and decided one day let me give it a try, after buying a carrot and apple juice drink from a health food store. Cost me $4.00 and I hated it. The young lady put more carrots than apples.I thought why not use the juicer I have at home and experiment to see what I like before wasting anymore money. Oh! my God it works beyond my expectation. I started off with Apple and Oranges. I know some reviewers put the apple in whole, I decided to core two apple and cut them in fours and peeled two the orange, giving me a 8 ounce glass of goodness. As soon as I put the fruit in, it zapped it fast. Clean up was easy as 1,2,3. And in the end I loved the way it taste, so fresh. The health benefits alone is a plus. I would highly recommend this juicier to anyone who is considering juicing but don't want to spend a lot of money. You get a great quality juicer without spending hundreds of dollars."
5,Breville juice fountain,Works great and easy to clean up. We purchased it mainly to juice tangerines from our tree here in Florida. Product exceeds our expectations.
5,"Compact, easy to use and fast!","We purchased this juicer for our parents and they adore it! I was concerned it may not have enough power, but that hasn't been the case. It is easy to use and clean and they are thoroughly enjoying all the different juice combinations they can make."
5,Amazing machine,"After using this a half a dozen times I'm still impressed by how it destroys anything and pushes it out into juice. The motor on this thing is dynamite. It's a bit difficult to clean but for the most part, I have nothing bad to say about it. And those who have complained about the juice missing the collection cup are a wonder to me. Mine has never spilled a drop."
2,Not that great! Would not recommend,"I ordered this juicer because it was smaller and more compact since I have restricted space on my counter top. I found that the motor is loud and too strong for the size of this juicer and it produces vibrations; additionally, the juice is seeping out at the seam, between the motor and the clear top cover. I have owned other juicers but so far, I have been most satisfied with the basic Jack LaLanne Power Juicer, which is quiet and very easy to handle and clean."
4,Breville BJE200XL Juicer,"I had been looking for an upgrade for the juicer I had bought at the wholesale club a few years ago. I had been tempted to go for the ""Juiceman"" but as I began reading what owners had to say, it had its share of negative reviews. Stumbled upon the Breville and almost bought the $300 stainless steel version. I decided to try the $100 model first to see how it operated before making the larger investment. I can say that I'm very satisfied and will make the upgrade in the future. I make my judgement on the amount of juice that a juicer can extract from a piece of ginger root or a carrot. I can say that this juicer does a very good job on both root veggies. The machine has an overall substantial feel to it. It breaks down easily. Cleaning is always an issue with juicers and I give this one a rating of 8 out of a possible 10."
4,Incredible Juicer,"The Breville juicer is easy to clean and is well worth the money. I was about to purchase the high end Breville and thought I would give this one a try first. It makes a great amount of juice, is easy to clean, easy to put back together and isn't loud. My only concern was that the pulp can fly up the chute due to the strong motor. I suppose simply placing my hand over the opening will eliminate that issue. I love that I can put large pieces of fruit or vegetables into the large chute! Overall this juicer is great!!"
4,Breville BJE200XL Compact Juice Fountain,This is an awesome product! Great machine and pretty easy to clean. I am very pleased with my purchase and would purchase again! Very well made and makes great juice.
1,NIGHTMARE PRODCUT + CUSTOMER SERVICE!!,"The product arrived damaged. I thought the chip was so small it may work and I wouldn't need to return it. Wrong!! I put some carrots into it and started it. It sprayed juice all over my walls and counter.I contacted Amazon to have it replaced. They asked me to pack up the product, return it and they would send a replacement to the original shipping address (my office).Somehow, they tagged my office as a residential address and now FedEx can't deliver the product until Tuesday because they don't work Mondays.Basically I ordered and paid for a product on December 28, 2012 (two day delivery) and its now January 7th, 2013 and have not been able to get the product."
1,"super wasteful idea, juicing is another fad/scam","There is no magic pill people, you just need to eat healthy and exercise. It's a liquid vitamin that your body cannot properly process. The end result is that your remaining expensive organic fruit and/or vegetable matter get's wasted. Your colon needs the fiber that you are throwing away. You don't need this product, just your mouth and teeth if you still have some."
3,Strengths and Weaknesses,"The good news about this juicer is that it has me eating more fruits and vegetables than ever before. On the downside, it's not completely efficient. The pulp tends to be fairly damp and I could say it wastes about an ounce of juice each time I use it. The instructions tell you to ""juice slower"", which works for solid things like apples or whole carrots, but the motor is so powerful that it devours any soft fruit in a split second without extracting all of the juice. Things like mango or any type of berries get wasted. In hindsight, I wish I would have purchased a powerful blender that can juice. Juicers waste the pulp, which is where a lot of the nutrition is. On the plus side, it's fairly easy to clean (5 minutes) and works quickly."
4,Love this juicer!,"Let me start by saying that I am not an experienced juicer. I was looking for something entry level that would be quick and easy to use and deliver a good quality juice mainly to trick my family into being healthier :) This juicer has definitely accomplished that goal. It juices up everything I've thrown at it so far and does a wonderful job. My 10 yo can't get enough of it and is constantly asking me if he can have a ""smoothie"". I will say that after about a month of use I am getting tired of having to clean it out every time and watching all the pulp go down the garbage disposal (I know, I should be composting - that is a goal of mine). I've seen people make crackers out of the pulp as well, but who has the time?? For a busy working mom, this fits the bill for me and my family. I like that the parts are very sturdy and dishwasher safe."
2,Unimpressive,"I am a fairly experienced trombonist, and I purchased the cd looking for a recording of the Serocki, which I was performing at the time. I found Sauer's interpretation to be robotic, and I felt as if he didn't find dynamics to be important aspects of music at all. In my opinion, he is being a technician and not a musician on this cd. His playing is entirely unimpressive, and not worth listening to at all. I recommend purchasing a Joe Alessi or Christian Lindberg cd, myself."
3,"Fun, but confusing","Lego Star Wars was a favorite for me on the X-Box, and for that reason I bought this game on the Nintendo DS in high hopes that it would be just as good, if not better, with the old movies as story lines.Sadly, the game is just as fun, but hard to play due to the confusing controls, odd camera angles and glitchy graphics.If this game cost $15 it would be worth it."
4,Lots Of Bugs...But Still Fun,"Despite all the bugs in the game, my son loves playing it. I was probably more disappointed in the quality of the game than he was. And he has all the other Lego Star Wars games as well. As long as he enjoys it, I guess that's all that matters. Either way, it was a good price."
1,WARNING! Do not buy this!,"Well all I want to say is the game is pathetic. Gameplay is the same as the PlayStation version. About 1 million glitches makes the game virtually unplayable, not to mention the terrible graphics. there's virtually no story, just a pile of levels stacked on top of each other rushed into the stores as soon as possible. If you own any other system, get it for that one.ScoreGraphics 0Gameplay 1Story 0Overall .3"
3,Lego Star Wars II - Fun but hard,The game is very hard but getting the mini-kits is harder. 10 mini-kits = 1 new person. There is no blood and no graphic deaths since it is a Lego game. Well worth the cost.
1,almost unplayable,"Bought this game for DS the first day it came out. Within minutes the glitches became clear - blank screens, rogue characters, etc, like the other reviewers. Within hours it started locking up completely at random intervals. Exchanged it. The new cartridge worked for 2 days, then began freezing - 4 times in 20 minutes. SAVE YOUR MONEY The game is frustratingly unplayable."
1,Utter disappointment,"I waited forever for this game. I had the older version of Lego Star Wars and it was great. I heard about this one and I couldn't wait for it. I finally got it, and it went back to the store a day later. The game is full of gliches, some of the gliches I could get around. The real show stopper and disappointment came when I got to episode 4 level 4, my character disappeared and I couldn't control the character, so it kept dying and I couldn't continue the game. I was able to get a store credit for another game, I recommend you return to the store where you purchased the game and show the sales clerk all the problems and glitches with the game. If enough people do this the manufacturer will get the message. We should not stand for poor quality control in these games."
1,Started out fun but quickly turned bad...,So many bugs in this game don't know where to begin. There were several times where my ship would disappear or the landscape would turn black and all you see are your characters. Characters always get stuck in corners etc. Just read the reviews below... My [...] year old son hates it too. I've always enjoyed all of the DS games until I bought this POS. Save your money.
4,Help in Rancor pit,"In the rancor pit, even though you can't get to it on free play, on story mode, you can get under the MIni Kit and do that double-jump-attack and you will jump higher to reach that. SO IT IS NOT UN-PLAYABLE."
4,Good but not great,This game doesn't have that many bugs. I have only found one. Most of the levels are difficult but you can get past them.
1,Garbage!!!,"I purchased this game since the previosu version of Lego Star Wars was awesome, it was well put together, fun story line and lots of perks.Lego Star Wars II for Nintendo DS is the complete opposite of this. I was incredibly dissapointed with the graphics, poor quality, awful camera angles, unccountable glitches and an overall bad experience.I cant believe that they actually release a game to the market with this level of problems and glitches. BIG QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES!!!! It is a ripoff, the game is not worth the money. I am actually discouraged to buy the PC version now as a result of my tasteless DS experience.Bad way to kill a good name."
1,Don't buy the DS Version!,"I am a huge lover and fan of the first Lego Star Wars. This one sucks. Ds and the developer botched this big time. Sure there are some fun moments but the hassle overshadows it on the DS. I am already thinking of trading it in for the console version. Oh, and the Prima Guide book has NOTHING similar with the DS version. In the rush to have it come out on several different consoles at the same time they must have taken the lowest bid for the DS. SHAME ON ALL WHO LET THIS BUGGY GAME THROUGH. The camera effects are terrible and you often will end up dead-ended in free play mode only to try the whole thing again. I cannot believe how disappointed I am. With some awesome DS games out there why would they let such a great and promising game hit the market like this. DO NOT BUY IT. Borrow it to see how much it sucks first."
1,Horrible Game Play,"The Nintendo DS version of this game is horrible.There are a lot of glitches in the game that make it hard to enjoy it. You can't even beat the game because of the glitches and some levels won't even let you go on. Who ever made this game obviously never played it.I do recomend the game though...on a different console. The gamecube version is just fine, spend the money on that, not on this one."
1,Not very well thought out...,"There is a process you go through in game development called play testing. They must have skipped this.The player control itself is enough to make you throw your DS against the wall. I have (sadly enough) put over 60 hours into playing the PS2 version of this game. They actually keep track of it for you. I wasn't expecting the same experience as the PS2 version, but I also wasn't expecting pure frustration.They simply didn't scope this out very well and didn't put much thought into the strengths and weaknesses of the DS system."
4,One of their better CDs,One of their better CDs. I am collecting all their material now after finding out about them by accident. I have become more interested in metal out of Italy recently.
3,Precious Moments 2000 Edition,"This new 2000 edition is a fastastic guide for all Precious Moments collectors. It is concise and contains all the necessary that a Precious Moments fan asks for. However, I am disappointed with the quality of the pictures in the Guide. If you compare this 2000 edition with the 1999 edition, the 1999 edition's pictures were much better in term of the sharpness and the colour quality."
4,I agree with Thomas,"While I'm very glad I got the book, I was also very disappointed in the quality of photographs -- and the surprising number of ""photo not available"" captions."
3,I expected it to be larger.,I expected it to be larger. Well. Thats alwys the price you pay for online shopping. Looks really nice. But if you have slightly larger fish think twice. My fishes never even gets closer/ Inside these corals.But It defnitly looks great. Great Hide out place for small fishes.
4,Check out the MST3k version of this movie,"Where to start?Well, big fat Texan cop goes to Malta for no adaquetly explored reason. He then gets involved in some kind of 'mystery', spends about three weeks chasing around the back streets of Malta five feet from the bad guys. I agree with the guy above, bad movie. The extra stars go to Best Brains for the MST3K version of this movie that I saw."
1,Meatballs fried in Lard!,"Oh god....You think you can take this movie? Well, goa'head on. It's your move."
1,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,This is without a doubt one of the worst films ever made. If I could give it no stars I would. A small time Texas sheriff goes to battle crime lords in another country. The plot is very weak and extremely stupid. It blows my mind that they have re-released this film for DVD when there are so many other good movies out of print that need to be released again. That's Hollywood for you.
1,Get it for the shower scene!,"Bad Bad Bad movie. It's rare to find a film not worthy of even 1 star, but this is one such film. The above reviews pretty much say it all, but I will point out the films good parts.I have not seen the MST3K version but I seriously doubt they showed the ""GOOD"" scenes.The poolside scene isn't bad. (MST3K probably edited this scene.) But the shower scene is awesome! I can't desribe it here, but most men will like it. (If MST3K didn't cut this scene completely out of the film, they probably showed a CHOPED up or ZOOMED version, but the unedited version is great!)"
3,heartland,"Abit slow,not up to his past standard. I do like the character Billy Tree,but he needs to lose the mock Irish crap."
4,WOW,"This is my first read by Wiltse and it looks like I am 3 yrs behind the crowd. I use the library exclusively for my reading material. So this one did not come to me with reccommendation by a friend. I grew up on the ""prairie"" and his descriptions are so on target it is scary. I had an uncle die in a grain storage accident so it happens for sure. By the end and the unveiling of one of the guilty parties, I was left to wonder which of the characters now living or dead were actually guilty of what.Wiltse is a very decriptive writer and I laughed til I couldn't see with some of the scenes, especially the ""stinking condition"" Billy would get himself into. Wiltse has my vote however belated."
1,low quality knock off.,"bought it for my wife, she won't watch it because it is such low quality. all are blurry and the sound is also garbled."
1,The worst movie I've ever seen....,"Hands down. I wish I could rate this on a negative scale. Look, I love terrible movies. Few things make me happier than settling down with a long-forgotten B-movie. But this.....this is an abomination. There is nothing redeeming here. The acting is godawful, the story seems to be the same three scenes playing over and over, and while it is clear that the makers of this trash (I won't disparage a century of film history by calling this a ""film"")thought they were shocking their audience by challenging conventions, they were really just indulging in the worst kind of ego stroking. This is supposedly a zombie flick, but that subplot is superfluous at best. It's really about torture porn, and even those scenes are so boring and devoid of anything resembling a human story that one can't help but yawn. If you are anywhere near this movie, run. Run far, and run fast. And never look back."
2,Cute but not worth the $,"This bowl is extremely cute but it does not suction to the high chair. I can get it to suction to the counter and my glass table but not on my baby's highchair, so it really doesn't serve the purpose it is suppose to."
2,choose another collection!,"The quality of this 2 CD set is uneven - one CD is passable, the other has uneven audio. The fault is not Johnny Cash's, but Delta Entertainment's, who feels the listener doesn't even merit information about where this ""Live"" concert was recorded, so obviously we don't merit decent sound mixing. My favorite Cash recordings are the vintage Sun labels... they can't be beat, but I was trying to find a copy of ""16 tons"". Made a mistake getting this version."
3,Okay,"This book was not the best out of the series, but i thought it was pretty good. I dont know why everyone thought it was so bad. What is wrong with a guy who's sixteen and doesn't want to be a jock and doesn't have a girlfriend? But, the book was about Ducky falling in love with Sunny but feeling weird about it. He likes her and doesnt want to ruin their friendship. I didnt think it had the best ending, though."
3,could have been much better,"In this book you can plainly see that ducky is in l o v e. but he doesn't want to destroy the friendship that he has with sunny, and it is disapointing to the reader because when the book reaches a certain climax( such as sunny coming on to ducky) there is always that downfall;which i have to say is very, very dissapointing. i hope that in her futuer books she will add a little more zest. by the way it has been a while since her last book was published, and i would like to know why she stoped!she is a very good writer."
4,This book was hilarious!,"I love the California Diaries series, and I love Ducky most of all. I don't laugh out loud while reading books that often, but this one was an exception. I love the way ""Ducky"" (Ann M. Martin) writes! It's hilarious. I might have changed the story a bit if I wrote it, but the humor was enough to keep me reading. One thing that made me sad, is that this appears to be the last book in the series. I adore this series, and would hate for it to end! Although it did seem to sum up everyone's problems at the end (especially Maggie, my second fav. character). Well, I leave you with my recomendations to read this book if you're in the mood for something light and humorous. And let's hope the series doesn't end!"
3,ehhh...,"The book was aight, but it was kinda weird.Sunny starts giving Ducky weird looks that he doesn't understand until Brendan tells him that he think Sunny like him.Then Ducky is all paranoid and stuff when Sunny asks him if he wants to go to the movies. At the end of the date, Sunny ends up kissing him.It ends good though..."
3,Slow Moving,"I enjoyed the complete left behind series, but found this book rather boring and slow moving."
4,Good writing for the Left Behind world,"This book is well done. Much better writing than onthe Left Behind series, better understanding of politics. I hope this writing continues to improve and write related books."
1,Religious ho hum masquerading as a political thriller,"If you want a book with a story line as interesting as a straight line then this one is for you. This is a ultra right/religious publication masquerading as a political thriller.Not even in the same country as Demille, Clancy etc... stuck at the airport then but a comic book for deeper plot and better writing."
3,Piles of clothes and wrecked vehicles,"This story, which parallels Left Behind by Tim LaHaye, is set amongst the White House staff and those close at hand. The character types are almost cloned from Left Behind: the shell-shocked pastor who never really believed, the professional man whose entire family is gone, the FEMA administrator whose son comes to Christ first. Some of the emotional upheaval is maudlin; many female authors ascribe buckets full of tears to their male characters. However, Christ is definitely lifted up as the true answer to their problems, and the gospel is clearly presented. Don't expect any great climax, or plot resolution.This could be a good book for a non-Christian who is open to learning more, or is intrigued with Bible prophecy. It didn't knock my socks off, but it was a very pleasant little read."
5,Good book,"This book was very well writen. I enjoyed it as well as the Left Behind books. The story was intresting and the book as a whole was a good read. Some people would tell you this is based on tall tales, but it is not. This book is fiction and just how one person thinks the last days will be like. But the book is based on ""Revelation"" about things that will happen some day. It may not be just like this book, but it will happen. To belive in the rapture doesn't mean you are beliving in tales. You are beliving the true and those that don't belive will realize they were wrong someday. This book helps us to rember just that fact. I recomend this book to anyone."
2,Political Intrigue? (I think not),"End of State is the political spin-off from the Left Behind series.You are introduced to 3 brand new characters to the Left Behind universe - main of the three is Brad Benton, White House Chief of Staff.If you've read any of the Left Behind books, you know the series deals with what is considered End Times theology including The Rapture.End of State deals with what goes on inside the White House during that event.I was disappointed with this book. I was looking forward to a political thriller along the lines of The Last Jihad but instead I get endless preaching and a very slow moving plot.Seeing as there were only 3 books made in this political off-shoot, I can assume the public felt the same way.Unless you collect everything Left Behind, do yourself a favor and forget about End of State."
4,Great start to a promising new series!,"Neesa Hart couldn't have started out her book any better! ""End of State"" begins at a Lakers game. Thousands of people crammed into the arena, watching their beloved Lakers play ball. Two seconds left on the clock, the score is tied, and the ball in in the air...headed for the goal. Then, in the blink of an eye, two players disappear from the court! Absolute pandemonium reigns and you're off to the start of a thriller, fill with well-rounded characters, new and old, from the Left Behind series. A great book, great story, and all around exciting read."
4,Very Easy to Rip,"I LIKE RIPPING PAPER AND WHEN I SAW AMAZON WAS SELLING SOME PAPER WITH NICE COLORS LIKE THIS I KNEW I HAD A NEW STACK OF PAPER TO RIP. I ORDERED IT AND AMAZON SHIPPED IT PRETTY FAST AND I GOT IT AND OPENED IT UP AND WAS ABLE TO RIP IT ALL APART. CHECK IT OUT, NO MORE PAPER IN MY HOUSE, IT'S ALL RIPPED UP. THANKS DOUG AND MELISSA (MENS NAMES FIRST, THIS IS AMERICA) FOR MAKING SUCH PRETTY PAPER THAT IS EASY TO RIP AND FUN TO RIP AND I HAD A GOOD DAY GOODBYE."
3,Great for kids - not so much for adults.,"First off, the basics, which seem to be lacking in the product description: 51 sheets, 17 colors, including primary colors, fluorescents, and metallics.This paper is probably a good choice for kids or origami beginners. The paper is thick, glossy, and bright, making it easy to fold and fairly vivid for designs. It's hard to get delicate with small folds, though, because of the thickness, and the one-color sheets (which are white on the back) aren't particularly interesting for use in designs, once you've made a few.The enclosed booklet is pretty basic, and includes five designs: airplane, swan, fortune cookie (looks like classic ""fortune teller""), wishing star, and inflatable cube. Again, good for absolute beginners, but it's not a set of paper that I'd buy more than once."
1,Ugh!,"This has to be the worst Origami paper I've ever tried to use. True, I'm not an expert, but I have bought Origami kits before and never had this much trouble with paper. For some projects, it's too stiff to fold (smaller folds) and on the tighter folds, it's constantly ripping. It's also difficult to do pivot folds, I think because it's so glossy. The colors are vibrant, and the metallic colors really are metallic (and very nice looking), but it's just too difficult to work with. Wouldn't buy this product again. That's what I get for buying cheap origami paper online...=/"
4,it is your basic origami paper,not really sure how you can like or dislike it or how i can write a review about it ..it is just your basic origami paper.
1,Too stiff and slippery !!,"This product is the worst ORIGAMI paper I've ever had.It is too stiff to hold and the surface is too slippery.I bought 5 boxes of this and it was definitely a failure of selection.This is not ORIGAMI paper, but thick-colored-paper.I should not have bought this for the cheap price."
2,not the best choice,"I really wish I hadn't bought two boxes of this. It's pretty, but the glossy surface and thickness make it impossible to fold delicately. It's too hard for kids and too frustrating for adults.I've never seen glossy origami paper before. This is probably why."
2,Confusing Product Description,"Melissa & Doug Origami Paper (6""x6"")Melissa & Doug Origami Paper (6""x6"")Two fine descriptions for the same product? On sale at 2 cents difference. Neither say how many sheets of paper, but one offers an 8 oz package of paper, with a shipping weight of 6.6 oz, the other a 1 pound package, with a shipping weight of 15 pounds. There is some serious shipping magic going on in both cases. One is classed as paper, the other as paint. Perhaps the Holiday rush got to the writing staff.I would like to know how many pieces of paper of what size and what weight. Seems simple, right? It is, after all, just paper.Or is it????"
3,Too thick for folding,"I had a real problem with this paper when I was trying to make cranes. It's a heavier weight paper than traditional origami paper, so it was harder to fold. Also, depending on how hard you crease it, there would be white lines in the paper where the fold was. I've given up on using this for origami and have relegated it to the craft bin for the kids."
5,Uber goop,Worked liked it said it would. No more rust or clanging dishes when the dishwasher runs. Very easy to use!!!!
5,good product,Excellent value to repair rusty dishwasher rack. So far it's holding up well. It was easy to use and minimally messy.
3,Uber Goop,"I only tried this on the bottom rack of the dishwasher to start with. It covered the rust spots well and the caps were good for covering the rusted/worn ends. We have run the dishwasher a few times since applying it and the caps and covering are staying on and we no longer have bits of rust floating around in the water or stuck to the dishes. But we have noticed a sticky residue on some of the dishes and utensils after they are washed. It washes off easily, but it is kind of a nuisance to have to rinse the dishes when we take them out of the dishwasher. I don't know for certain that this residue is from the Uber Goop, but we have not changed soaps or done anything differently, and it has only appeared since I applied the Uber Goop and caps to the bottom rack."
4,great fix,This product is easy to use and a good value for your money. The glue does seem to dry out quickly in the bottle while you are using it though. It seems to be working well so far in the dishwasher. Even worked to fix areas that didn't need a cap.
1,A tip for dishwasher repair caps,"We got the repair rack caps and liquid vinyl, but after putting them on and using the liquid vinyl to to touch up some of the racks we found most of the caps at the bottom of the dishwasher. The liquid vinyl worked okay but the caps didn't work at all. And after paying $20.00 dollars for little pieces of plastic and shipping we are not pleased with the results. The vinyl works when I turned the rack upside down, then raised the bottle up to dip the tip in."
5,Uber Goop White,"I have used this product 2 x to repair badly damaged dishwasher trays (fortunately not mine). It works great, but tends to get a little gooey around the opening of the bottle after ~15 minutes of use. Would recommend immediate use of this product when any tray damage becomes evident, as once rust begins, or there is a break in the plastic covering of the prongs for holding the dishes, damage progresses quickly. Note that the cost of replacing dishwasher trays is only slightly less than purchasing a new dishwasher."
1,Dishwasher Rack repair,it is not as easy as we would like to have it been but cheaper than new racks. Did not really pursue.
5,Works great!,The inside of the dishwasher now looks just like new. All rust and nicks are covered and the washed dishes are rust free.
2,Uber Goop too goopy,"It would be fine for a small nick which you are fixing within a few days of it happening. Most of us procrastinated till rust was more extensive and with this, Uber Goop dries much too fast to permit leveling or adequate coverage."
1,overpriced,Save yourself ten bucks and buy a larger bottle of liquid latex at your local discount hardware store!
4,Works well,"Sadly, I waited too long before a decision to buy a repair kit. I had to do more scrapeing and fileing than I anticipated. The product is as advertised and is easy to apply once the prep work is completed."
4,dishwasher facelift,"Very timely shipping, good product, improved look of racks as well as buying me time before replacing dishwasher"
3,ok,"I bought these-they are difficult and messy to apply-the glue is hard to get into the hole and if applying many-the glue begins to dry on the applicator-it does not give good directions. The glue/paint does not cover up or fix the rust spot even when you get off the rust. As a whole, it is ok but nothing special. I should have saved my money."
3,Instructions?,"The product came with the name of a website to go to for instructions. There was a link, there, for another website on which to find directions. But, alas, there were no instructions there, either.I was not sure how to use it. I put the goop on the rusty parts. After a few minutes I added a second coat and covered it with the little caps.I am not sure what the point of color selection is with this product. I purchased white, which turned pink within the first week. Fortunately I have daughters."
4,"Works well, but you better be fast.",The sealant dries very quickly and we had several fall off in the first run of the dish washer after initial install (did not install them quickly enough). We have only had a few random others come off since correcting our error. It made the dish washer rack look like new again.
2,Only OK,"This was a second order for this product, as the first time I didn't order enough. The caps in this order weren't as snug as the first, as a result of which they easily pop off during unloading, ending up in various inconvenient places in the dishwasher. I suppose this is a matter of quality control."
5,Bad Things Do Happen,Bad things do happen and how do we handle it as adults with children in mind? What do we say and how we say it definitely affects the children now but also potentially in how they deal with things when they have children.
4,Get It Moving...,I absolutely love these cd's. I bought them to teach dance to and I think the kids and i are going to have lots of fun with them. They get you moving..I listen to them in my car as well..There are several beautiful tracks that take you to another time and place.
5,Hefty and Elegant,"I bought ten of these hooks, and I am very happy with all of them!They are functional and classy.Ordering direct from Eagle Emporium's website may (or may not) offer a better deal on shipping."
3,Don Martin hasn't lost a thing,"When it was at the peak of it's popularity, Mad Magazine was everywhere an adolescent boy looked, and this set of paperback books was an interesting attempt to carry the appeal of the magazine into a paperback book format.The book is not much different from the comic drawings that were so prominently featured in the magazine. In this particular book, Don Martin sends up daytime soap operas as only he can, and there's also the by-now-standard feature of Kaptain Klutz, the superhero who struggles with, well, just about everything.Don Martin doesn't strike me as a comic genius in the same way that other modern comics do, but he does have a certain flair for simple parody, and the jokes come so fast and furiously that I sometimes think I've wandered onto the set of an Airplane movie.If you're a Madaholic, you should pick this collection up for nostalgia's sake; otherwise, I would recommend the magazine over these books."
2,Large amount of information but little organization,"This book is a good text book on the user in that their is a large amount of information worded well and is easy to understand and rarely hard to read. Yet at the same time the chapters have no end of chapter wrap up to allow for easy studying on the fly. Most sociology books ive used had had this in my collage courses and it allowed you to study a few pages of concentrated information and read the rest of the text if i had a hard time grasping the concepts presented. What makes this worse is the book doesn't have key terms often in bold and the text is very very wordy and has to many examples and seems to go into recursive loops of examples of the same ideals the entire chapter. I cant really recommend this book, its painful to read and i like to learn if its handled correctly but this book doesn't."
1,Mail issues,"I ordered this book in the middle of August and am still in the process of trying to get a refund (9/19/2010). I never received the book and have called a couple times, spoken to UPS, and been emailing back and forth. They said they have started a trace, but I have not been updated on the where-abouts of the book. Apparently the tracking information says it was delivered to my door so it could be an issue with the mail delivery. Either way, a refund should be granted and I'm not impressed with the company's system of doing so."
2,Fairly one-sided text,"Mr. and Ms. Feagin make many fine points in this text and do a good job bringing up little known information on many groups, from Irish-Americans to Native Americans, American Jews to African Americans. The reason such little-known evidence is needed though is because the Feagins try to force their views on people. They do this by selecting only the articles and ideas that support their views, however contradictory this is. For instance, they go into great detail on explaining why various groups of white Americans are different...then turn around in other sections and assume all white Americans are identical. As much as I would like to support Mr. Feagin, many of whose views match my own, this is hard to do with his one-sided, heavy-handed approach. Not particularly recommended - David Healey's book on racial and ethnic relations is a preferable alternative."
5,Great CD for Anne fans!!,"I bought this CD to listen to at work because I NEED music when I'm working and this CD gets me focused and puts me in a great mood.Some of the tracks are pretty short, but all are sweet.If you love the music score in the Anne of Green Gables movies, you will love this CD."
3,Bintannica is better,"Britannica has more information than Encarta. But Britannica has worse interface than Encarta.If you want better contents, Britannica will be the one. Encarta has very little information on many different subjects."
3,Picture quality could be better,"As usual, the DVD version is better than the CD version because you don't have to swap the disks. However, the picture quality of the photos, especially the 360 tour is the worst this year. Maybe Microsoft wanted to pack to much information into one DVD. Only 10 more video clips than last year and most are in poor resolution. With the development of so much technology applications, I would expect their product better each year.Still, no homework help or research help for any foreign languages. The research organizer is a helpful tool but takes some time to learn how to use it. By joining the ""Encarta Club"", a free service online, you get to get access to Encarta's content anywhere in the world as long as you can get online, which is a pretty good feature. However, you must be a MSN passport member."
1,L A COOKBOOK;SIMPLE RECIPIES........ETC.,I NEVER RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT ALTHOUHG i PAID FOR IT. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS.............THANK YOU .........DAN ELLIOTT
4,Flying wonders from around the world,"Scientific American is one of America's most well known popular science journals. Part of its appeal is its periodic contests in different fields of science and technology. One of these is a paper airplane contest held annually. The top entires are summarized in this book, one of the better paper airplane books out there. The models range across different size ranges and have a variety of looks. The difficulty in building these models range from light to very difficult, and hence provide hours of entertainment for those willing to use their hands to build some stuff. Some require ""cheating"" in the form of scissors and tape, but the results are incredible looking models that do really fly. Overall, I recommend this book."
5,A fun distraction!,My dad brought this home when I was a kid.I spent hours building and flying these paper airplane models.Some of the designs are surprising.I am very excited to have my won copy after all these years.The planes vary from very easy to hard to build and so will satisfied a wide range of kids (from 5 to 100).A great parent/child activity!
2,Meh...,Put this in my Thermaltake Armor+MX VH8000 case and have not seen much of a difference in temp. The fan is NOT powerful... it acts to just lightly push some air out and not suck out heat. If you put your hand in back of it while its on you will know what I mean... the strength of the air coming out is not forceful at all. Kind of a waste for something taking up 2 PCI slots!With that said it is not very noisy and I left it in my case to take out some of the heat from the bottom of my case. On my next build I am probably going to leave this out.
1,Worthless piece of junk,"A perfectly good waste of $20 and two card slots. It didn't reduce the system temp even 1 degree. Installed it and let it run for several days. Hold a tissue in the back of the PC near the slot. You'd think it would flutter even a bit. Nothing. Can't feel any airflow either but its running, I checked. Worthless piece of junk."
1,LOUD!!!!,"I hope there is something wrong with the one I got. I can't imagine anything this loud ever being sold. Ran it for about 30 minutes and had to take it back out. Makes a high pitched whining sound that can't be ignored and doesn't blend into the background, super annoying. It doesn't make that sick sound a fan makes when it is damaged, its running nice a strong, just loud as heck. The pitch even cuts through loud video game sounds, pathetic. Going to try to get it replaced, but not willing to risk paying any more for shipping.EDIT: Amazon replaced the fan at no charge, I am sad to say the new one is no different. My SPL Meter shows it around 35-40 dBA, not the 16 advertized. Trust me on this, I have used a lot of PC fans, always stick with the quite ones because my computer is in my bedroom. This fan is unusable. Even watching videos or playing games at full volume you can still hear the fan. I can't think of any scenario where this fan would be usable. Don't buy it!!"
4,cooler ;),"perfectly working whit another fan coolers to keepo my pc with a good air flow, helping it to run smooth! ;) very good item to get ;)"
3,Thermaltake A2414 is doing just fine,Nice item. At first I gave a mediocre review but I was not reading the temperature correctly. The unit does work and was a good investment.Irv
2,Noisy,Thought it may be a good idea to help cool my video card which doesn't have an on-board fan; but this product is noticeably loud.
2,quiet for 7 months,"It worked well for 7 months, then it became noisy. It is now the most prominent noise in my computer. It has been on 24/7 for the last 7 months."
4,ForeRunner 301 - close to perfect,"All around the best workout tool I have used to date. I am definately a ""gadget buff"" so I have tried MANY other toys. The best feature about this tool is the ability to download your workouts to you computer to track your progress. I even use it when on a stationary bike or treadmill so that I can track my heartrate & download it to my computer.Gripes - I am not happy with the chest strap. I am 6'5"" and workout on a regular basis so I have a fairly large chest. The strap is big enough, but I cannot find a happy medium when it comes to fit. No matter how tight I try to make it, the strap still tries to slide down to my waste as I breath in & out.I would also like the strap for the reciever to be bigger so that I could wear it on my upper arm. (too small even with the extension strap)The final gripe is that the GPS is useless in the woods."
5,Love the Forerunner 301 !!!,"I highly recommend the 301. I have not had any problems with it. It works great and accurately every-time that I have used it. In the last three months I have used it at least thirty times and it works flawlessly.I have never had problems with the GPS tracking my position while running outdoors, and never had any problems with the heart-rate monitor either.This device is very lightweight for all the features that it offers and the screen is easily readable.This GPS has motivated me to run more often, trying new routes, and made it more fun.I hope this helps to make your decision easier. I HAVE NO REGRETS and I think it was worth every penny.Howard"
5,Best I have ever used,"I have been a serious cyclist for years and have used all types of cyclcomputers and heart rate monitors. The Garmin Forerunner 301 is the most accurate, most flexible and easiest to program and operate of any. The download capability and data analysis capability are the best, much better than my previous unit a Ciclosport Hac4, and $200 less than the Hac4.I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Good GPS But Low Quality Heart Rate Monitor,"The GPS on the Forerunner is a very good system. It's easy to use and accurate. I've used it for running, hiking, biking and kayaking and it's worked great every time.The heart rate monitor (chest strap) that comes with the Forerunner is one of the older, cheaper systems. It's large, bulky, and not very comfortable. There are much better heart rate monitors out there that would have been a better addition to this system.Until Garmin upgrades the heart rate monitor I'd recommend sticking with the Forerunner 201 (the same system without the heart rate monitor). The Forerunner 301 is just not worth the extra money."
2,Very frustrated with the heart rate monitor,"I bought this unit two or three years ago and until recently used it very little. I had to take a break from running for a while. In any case, I think the GPS is very good. I previously had a Timex GPS (with the separate unit on the upper arm). The Garmin is more compact, loses signal less frequently and acquires the signal quicker. I love the ability to program workouts. I also like Garmin's software that tracks workout and even maps the routes you've run.However, the heart rate monitor is causing me no end of frustration. I have tried changing batteries, using different liquids on the elctrodes, repositioning the strap, etc... But, nothing makes for a consistent signal. This really adversely impacts my enjoyment of the unit. My bottom of line Polar heart monitor works much, much better in this respect."
5,Garmin 301 Review,"Within a week I sold my altimeter, heart rate monitors and bike computers. I immediately realized I didn't need any of them any more. And above and beyond merely replacing the functions of these items, this device gives functionality and analysis capability that none of these devices are capable of providing. I've never been all that anal about analysing training data, but this is the best and most useful training tool I've acquired in at least 20 years."
1,Forerunner 301,"I was really excited to get this product as I was hoping to train for a triathlon and was pumped that it included a bike setting. I had a forerunner 201 before which I loved. However, I really dislike this model and I felt I needed to warn anyone looking to buy this model. The satellite is CRAP. I can run the same route 4 different times and get 4 different distances. The satellite goes out - it doesn't matter if I am in the city, on a trail, or just main roads in the suburbs. I have found when I have run races and brought my garmin the mileage is WAY OFF - I'm talking 3.7 according to Garmin for a 5.1. Understandably it has a lot of great features, but not worth the price if it can't do the simple things it advertises. Buyer beware!"
2,This does not work well for indoor workouts.,"The calorie counting doesn't work at all without the GPS, so indoor workouts like at a gym seem not to work. I called their technical support and they said its a measure off the distance that you travel via GPS and indoors the GPS doesn't work. So it will always register 0. Bummer. For someone running outdoors only...really cool and simple."
4,very nice watch for the price,"This watch is very easy to use and has all you need for the price. Don't know what more you could find in the $350 watches out there. The only thing that is a little hard to deal with at times is the satellite connection doesn't always work. Perhaps that has nothing to do with the watch, though, and with the satellite system. I bought this watch for my husband, and he uses it every morning while running. Very motivating!"
2,Garmin 301 GPS Watch,Go with the newer Garmin 501. The 301 is too big for jogging. Also battery died in heart mointor two weeks after I got the watch.
4,Worth the money,I have noticed that the distance it calculates is not consistent. I run the same distance every day and it is off by as much as 100yds. I thought the accuracy would be better but I understand there are issues with the satellite signals and I do loose the signal occasionally because I run under trees. Other than hat this product is great. I'm able to see my distance I run and track it with the software provided. I would recommend this product.
4,Garmin 301 fore runner,This device works very well. The GPS is nice to have a distance (give or take the fudge factor) for paths and routes that are not easily measured. I have had no problem with the heart monitor. The training partner is a great tool to run against. Although mine seems to win more that it should;) if you are looking for within inches distance accuracy then this is not your device. If you are looking for accuracy within the GPS deviation then I endorse this device.
4,"Good, but not without flaws","The product worked very well for the most part. The features exceeded my expectations and should satisfy both beginner and serious athletes. My complaints are three, and they are ones I can live with. If you are running on a course that has many tight turns, the average speed calculation will get distorted on the turns because of the calculation intervals using the GPS are not quick enough. In other words, it is very accurate going straight or with gradual turns, but less so in tight places. The second issue is the monitor did not recognize the heart rate chest strap very quickly when you first strap it on. In most cases it took over 2 minutes to start after it put on correctly (we were careful to follow instructions). Lastly, it took about 2-3 minutes to initialize (find satellites) when it was first turned on. I have other Garmin boat and car units that initialize in less than 30 seconds. Aside from that, I loved it."
1,Unreliable - Buy something else,"This unit seemed to work OK for 6 months, then became very unreliable.When resetting the data the distance would inexplicably jump ahead, thus rendering all data inaccurate. Customer support was not helpful, so I would recommend trying another brand and model."
5,Excellent training Monitor,"I have the Forerunner 305 and I love it. It monitors my heart rate, my pace, my route, my distance, elevation, and my lap and total time. When I download the information, I get a plot of up to 4 variables vs time or vs distance. The GPS location seems to be accurate to about 5-10 feet horixontally and 15-20 feet vertically. I am amazed. I run in Santa Fe, a high desert with no tall buildings. It took awhile to figure out all of the options and I still have not used them all. You can program 3 screens with 2-4 readouts on each. I display 4 values on each screen. One screen for instantaneous lap values of time, distance, pace and heart rate. One screen for last lap total time and distance and average values of pace and heart rate, and one screen for total workout values of the same parameters."
2,Forerunner NOT a training air,"The GPS part of the Forerunner is good, it keeps satellite contact all but in the thickest woods. I use on my bicycles, both road and mountain, mounted with the optional handlebar mounts.The problem is that the heart rate monitor is just plain junk, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I started using contact gel - no difference. Garmin sent me a new chest transmitter, this worked for a couple months, now back to sometime works sometimes doesn't. Change batteries, still no difference. No I've been using Polar HR monitors since 1988 and never had a problem.Don't waste money on the HR monitor style - they are junk"
5,Great Product so far!,"I've only had it for a bit over a month, but it's been great so far! I love the results it gives me (Avg. HR, HR over time, Pace, etc); it's just what I wanted. The GPS map on the computer can be a little off (it can show your path as being in a river if you're close to one), but it records the actual path well, with respect to turns, etc. I have seen that some people have troubles getting the HR monitor to work (no HR shows up). This has happened to me twice, but by wetting the contacts on the inside of the chest strap and/or readjusting my strap (placing it lower or higher), I got the HR to show up again."
2,"Great for outdoor running, terrible for indoor workouts","As most users have commented, this is agreat device for outdoor running and tracking workouts, although the instantaneous heart rate and pace readings can be erroneous.I have one MAJOR complaint that I haven't seen here. How come it cannot calculate calories burned indoors, based on the heart rate reading (instead of GPS)? My primary use for this gadget is a tracking tool - for my outdoor miles and my indoor calories. I don't care what my heart rate was - I want to know how many bon-bons I can eat when I'm done working out. Even $100 heart rate monitors calculate calories - why doesn't Garmin?!?!?"
4,Love the Garmin Forerunner 301,"I waited to write my review after having the product for a while. I really like it. It is great for running, biking as well as hiking. The interface is very user friendly though I have to admit I have not tried customizing it as of yet. The only small complaint I have is that the 301 it is quite large and awkward when running (thus the 4 stars & not 5). For the money it is a very good value."
2,Not accurate!,"I have had this device for a a little over a week, one of my favorite runs is around Lake Merrit in Oakland CA. Running clockwise, the device reports 3.1mi while running counterclockwise, the device reports 2.7mi. I spoke with someone from Garmin at the Consumer Electronics Show who agreed that the 301 products are not very accurate but told me that the 305 product, which uses the SiRFStarIII chip is much more accurate. I am returning my 301 and may buy a 305."
2,Mrs,The product seemed to have everything you would need in a GPS. The only con is that the watch was somewhat larger than expected.
3,Trouble with Heartrate Sensor!,"I got the Forerunner 301 as a Christmas present from my wife,charged it up and turned it on and everything looked good. I finally got a chance in January to go for a run, the Forerunner worked great except the heartrate monitor. Could not get it to work! Contacted their support people via e-mail and they were great sent me out a new heartrate monitor with strap. Still no good! The problem must be in the main unit! Anyway, I now have to return the entire unit back to Garmin for repair, since Amazon won't take it back being over 30 days since the sale.I would suggest if anyone wants to buy one don't do it over Amazon, since you can't take it back to the store. I believe the Forerunner would be a great tool if the heartrate monitor worked."
5,Forerunner 301,"Great little piece of tech. I've been using it for running, biking, ,hiking and rowing, and the amount of info it can give you is amazing. This can really push your training along, especially if you don't have a training partner. The built-in workouts are OK, but too many have unrealistic heart rate zone settings - if you're a biker, just try to pedal at 4 mph on the flats! But no worries, as all workouts are modifiable and customizable, as are the heart rate zones. My only complaint so far after a month of use is that the satellite access time can be relatively long - 2-3 minutes each time. This could be a function of the area around my house, but it's not that big a problem. Overall a great item - definitely worth the $200."
5,garmin 301,"find the product very useful overall. the trail feature is a little difficult to follow as it does not use a map. i have trouble setting the heart rate limit beep. the gps is typical in terms of making contact with the signal (often several minutes) but it maintains a signal pretty well. i would buy the product again. check the software before you buy if that is a major reason for the purchase, as it is really limited in my view."
4,Garmin 301,"I love this thing..My only complaints are that the heart rate number is too small, and once in a while I lose the signal. Other than that, it's wonderful!"
2,look before you buy,"I have owned my forerunner 301 about 3 months. I'm satisfied with the GPS functions, which are easy to use and gives fairly consistent results. It does not have enough memory to download maps, so the map screen is a waste. The USB dust cover is poorly designed; I keep mine on with a piece of tape! My biggest gripe is with the heartrate functions. The extra money spent for heartrate monitoring is a waste. Mine hasn't worked from the beginning. I end up wearing the Forerunner on one wrist for distance data, and my Polar 601 for accurate, reliable heartrate data on the other wrist. (Yes, my wife laughs at the ""Techno-Geek""!) Also, the Forerunner software is poor. Unlike the Polar program, it cannot be edited, printed, or organized into a useful training diary. Bottom line: look for something cheaper in a GPS unit and review the Polar watches for a heartrate monitor."
2,Heart Rate Monitor Malfunctions,"I have been using my 301 for 2 months now. At first the heart rate monitor worked fine, but lately it has not been giving a consistent reading. The monitor will work for a few mintues and then stop working completely. I've stopped my workout to tighten the strap, but it hasn't helped. The GPS unit works great, but the HRM is worthless."
4,Great Product,"I have several other Garmin GPS products and this one is on the same level with them. When it comes to GPS I think Garmin is the industry leader, especially for hand held units. I had some trouble with the heart rate monitor in the beginning, but once I tightened the strap it worked better. I have had other brand of Heart rate monitors and this one you need to have the band much tighter than the others. The only down side to this product is the size of the unit on your arm. It is very lightweight but is pretty large. I would recommend this product for anyone. The software is really user friendly. You can even Geocache with it. All in all it is a great addition to my running."
1,Heart rate monitor unsatisfactory,"From the day one, heart rate monitor showed erratic number or won't show any number at all. Sent back twice, each time unit passed their test. I've tried everything from placement of chest strap to using gel on the sensor to no avail. Last 2 years heart rate monitor works only 1/3 of the time. I gave up. But it's a good concept if they can make it work right. Apparently this is a common problem by looking at the internet blogs/entries. I'd imagine newer Forerunners solved this problem? Be prepare to return the merchandise, but perhaps, it'll work for you?"
1,Didn't work well,"Only time I used it for exercise, it registered my resting pulse at 202. I could not get it to function, although it did well when I was at rest. I returned it. Hopefully the next generation of these will function better."
4,how to make it better,I really enjoy the product i bought but....when i recieved it in the mail it did not have the outlet power adapters or oweners manuel. also i am in the military so this works great for me and running but on the GPS Side it gives one option for grids not a military option for grids which dont help me. but over all a good product thanks.
5,GREAT FOR RUNNING & BIKING,THIS IS AN EXCELLENT GPS SYSTEM. MY WIFE USES THIS TO RUN AND I USE IT TO BIKE. GREAT FEATURES.
4,Works well but plan on replacing it in a couple years!,"I really like my Garmin. It tracks miles well. You can see heart rate, distance, pace, and time all at once. There's even a virtual training partner, but I've never used it. The only problem is that they only last for about 2 years and then just quit. This is my third Garmin Forerunner. I suppose it's from being exposed to the elements and sweat almost every day."
4,Great product but reception marginal,"I have really enjoyed this product and it works great in areas where the GPS signal is relatively unobstructed. I live in New England and frequently run through areas with a lot of trees. I find that the signal reception is spotty in some areas which makes most of the features on the watch useless. As long as I am in an area where I get a good signal, I love it."
3,Training Device,"I purchased this device with great expectations. I wanted to be able to see what my heart rate would be at any given pace. The GPS worked well. If you are running in city streets, it will not be accurate. On wide open trails, it worked great. The problem is the heart rate monitor. It worked well for about two weeks. It then just spit out random numbers while I ran. I made sure it was fully charged, and it still gave inaccurate readings. I have tried tightening the strap and ensuring the contact was good. Still inaccurate. It works well when I am not running. I will return it and wait until Polar makes the heart rate monitor for this device. Garmin, are you listening? You will have the perfect tool for the serious athlete if you can make an accurate heart rate monitor."
2,Nice but not perfect,"I have been using the product for about 4 weeks. Running in the downtown areas--Seattle, Portland, Phoenix, etc. the product did not work well. Further, running in parks with trees also causes considerable interference. I was also disappointed in the accuracy of the pace; it is slow to react to changes in pace. It is nice for general information."
3,OK GPS Receiver-Poor Heart Rate Monitor,"I have owned the 301 GPS since October 2005. So you can say I have some experience with it, mostly for walking an running. The GPS is Ok, not great it can easily lose the GPS signal under threes or close to buildings. Most of the time works OK but sometimes (when you know the actual distance) you would notice 400-500 meters missing in your run (in a 5 Km run). The heart rate monitor is poor. It goes up to very high heart rate readings and you know you are not doing 220 bps and then goes quickly down to a more reasonable level such as 145, closer to what you feel is the actual rate. I would rate the GPS receiver with 3 stars and the heart rate monitor with 2 stars, overall 3."
5,Wow!,This GPS unit is absolutely awesome. There is not one thing about it that I wish worked differently or better.
4,Outstanding tool,"The heart rate monitor straps across your chest. I am a guy, so really no problem, but may be a problem for the female crowd. Is very accurrate and battery lasts for several hours."
2,Garmin 301,"The HRM function works great, but the GPS is not very accurate. Did a test run on track, and the distance measured was about 8% off."
3,Good for training!,I bought this for my husband to help him train for the Marine Corps Marathon. He loved it and it helped a lot with the training. The GPS did fail at times and was inconsistent. Overall it was a good device and helped him keep track of his progress.
5,Perfect - Hanging S. American Spears,"Great quality. Homemade iron. Very simple but real iron you can bend/tweak a bit. Nice for hanging any thin long item like spear, bow or sword"
3,Multivitamins,"The product, overall, contains many of the vitamins that I need and want. However, the product does not contain all of the vitamins that are currently listed under the description of the item. I would suggest that the seller revise the product description to reflect this."
2,High on their own fumes of greatness,"2 1/2The rarities sound like eh and outtakes bleh, but live inclusion of especially Ritual material makes this fan-exploit tolerable."
2,Should have left well enough alone,"For my money, the only three Jane's albums worth owning were THE three, and this is just a shameless attempt from Warner's and/or Farrell to cash in on what should have been a fantastic ending and career when they finished up with Lollapalooza. Here it's useless out-takes, unfinished versions of songs they already perfected on the studio albums, and these 'reunion' tracks which leave way too much to be desired. Any self-respecting fan should have more sense than to pick this one up."
3,"Good, but not exciting.","This is a good CD. The new tracks are all right, the demos are decent, and the live tracks are great. But I wouldn't bother picking this up until you have both Jane's Addiction CDs and both Porno For Pyros. Those CDs all have new - more interesting - music, instead of new versions (re-hashings...) of old hits. If you have all of of those albums and still want more, Kettle Whistle (or Perry Farrel - Rev) is the place to be. This CD is not a good introduction to Jane's Addiction since the demos and outtakes are so raw. New fans probably want one of the albums first (either one - both are great.)"
4,Good collection of previously unreleased material.,"I'm a big Jane's fan. The ""new"" tracks aren't actually new at all.. I've heard them on bootlegs for years. However, this is a nice compilation for fans of JA that can't be bothered swapping bootlegs on the Internet.Of course, this is not comprehensive. There are live songs and plenty of bizarre ramblings by Perry at his live gigs that aren't included here, but overall, it's a fine treatment.My one major complaint is that they didn't include ""LA Medley"". By far my favorite unreleased track."
4,Slow Divers,"Jane's addiction was simply pure brilliance and they represented a dedication to art and originality that is rarely seen. If you are not a believer, this album will not change that. If you are a believer, this album has as it's prize gem the track Slow Divers. Hearing this cut for the first time gives you that buzz that is so rare and phenominal. Lets face it Jane's fans, we have all played most of the rest of the tracks on this album thousands of times, so 'divers' really did it for me. It was new, fresh, smooth, creative--even by the high standards set by Jane's Addiction! que chevere"
2,For kids,"Very disappointing product from Microsoft .very light in content, short articles, very few animations and videos. I'll call it initiation encyclopedia .may be its good for children from 3 to 12 years old but absolutely not for the whole family as stated.I'm university student and I find Encarta Deluxe Encyclopedia 2004 useless ."
1,"Not a good product, Microsoft.","I do not like this product because it's video is garbled, it gorges hard drive space,it doesn't have world flights, and the articles do not have much detail; they are very short. And if you do not have enough hard drive space to copy all data over to your hard drive, you have to swap CD's to find data (Not very convinient, it scratches CD's and is annoying to do a million times.)I sent it back to Microsoft on their 45-day money back garuntee, and they will send my money back. I will be getting Microsoft Encrta 2004 Library Reference Edition.If I were you, I would do the same thing. If you buy this product you are doing the wrong thing. I do not like anything about this product. Do not get it."
3,Reference resource,"Encarta allows students to retrieve current information on thousands of topics. The reference tools are great for research papers and slide show presentations. Students can cross-reference the Internet with little effort. As well as, export information into Word and Power Point.The software delivers reliable content through multimedia, articles, web links, images and maps. And still yet, information is given on sidebars and timelines throughout. Encarta allows students to access up to date reference materials with ease. Microsoft updates the software automatically to keep information accurate.I feel that Encarta is one resource every secondary level classroom should have and utilize."
1,Not DVD quality.,"This Telesales addition not worth the 25 dollars. Digitally remastered yeah right, VHS maybe. I still want a good copy."
3,Softcore Slasher film?,"This has to be one of the stranger skin flicks i've ever encountered.Made in the early 80s at the height of the Slasher movement in the States,this film combines a softcore plot about a sexy teacher(Sybil Danning)who is sleeping with her student(Eric Brown,who had similar ""trouble"" with Sylvia Kristel in Private Lessons(1981),while a maniac is killing the supporting cast in very gory fashion!Most famous for being THE showcase for the ample nudity presented by the beautiful Miss Danning,who seems to undress every few minutes,the film is so bizarre as it tries to combine two genres that do not in any way fit together.In no way a good movie,this still will please Skin fans and certainly the most curious of gorehounds,but it's no classic in the latter.Still,Trash fans have to give this one a view."
2,HO--------T BODY.,"I wish I had teachers like Sybil when I was in school. However, I look for something more like in the something weird videos. Crazy and weird sex stuff like."
2,"Below par remake of 1974 drive-in classic ""The Teacher"" by same director","This is a remake of 1974's drive-in classic ""The Teacher"" by the same director, which starred Angel Tompkins and Jay North. It was in my opinion not only light-years better, but much more realistic too. Can you really believe in this film that a worldly woman like Sybil Danning would give a kid like Eric Brown the time of day?? Andrew Prine is a good actor and is also wasted here. Angel Tompkins was a real woman where Sybil Danning is too worldly and experienced. To each their own, however."
2,There Playing with Fire,I was impressed with this movie Sybil Danning is a very sexy women in my opinion I sore this movie some years ago and always wanted to have it in my libary I believe this is the best movie Sybil has made in my youth if a women came across like that to me I would never forget here and this is the case today ...a very sexy movie with a very sexy actress
2,ok movie,Not much of a story but enough nudity to keep you interested. Not a great movie but ok for a rental.
1,Above rating does not apply to Sybil Danning's nude scenes!,"Fast-forward through the rehashed (so to speak) mad-slasher plot and enjoy Sybil Danning giving her all in scenes that even Leonard Maltin called ""formidable"" (see his review here). Heavens!"
2,Disappointing,"I saw this years ago. My memory was fuzzy. Yes, Sybil Canning is a well built and quite the attraction. Otherwise a thin plot and average acting. On top if that the DVD was VHS quality."
2,Could Have Been Better,"This mock drama about how easy it is to get nuclear weapons inside America SHOULD have been frightening. It lacked the horror factor it should have had to get it's point across. The acting was poor and the Ho-Hum attitude made the piece loose it's real meaning. Wish a better job had been done, because this issue is a real problem that needs greater attention."
3,Good for classroom discussion...,"Not the best acting I've ever witnessed, but it is a good, short video to use for students when discussing nuclear proliferation."
3,No longer 18/10 flatware,"I received 10 placesettings of this flatware in 1997 for my wedding. I just ordered 6 more placesettings of the same at the end of Dec 2009. When I received them I noticed they were not quite as heavy and not as rounded as my older sets. After a few washes, I took a closer look at them as they weren't washing as well either. I noticed the stamp on the back of the new ones says 18/8 not 18/10. I am not as pleased with the new sets and am very disappointed that companies keep selling this product as 18/10 when it is not."
3,"Still good, but quality has declined.","We received a set of Gorham Studio flatware for our wedding over 10 years ago. It had a great, weighty feel and an impeccable finish, and we used it as our everyday flatware set for over 10 years with nightly trips to the dishwasher. After over 10yrs of heavy use and hard water/dishwasher beatings, a couple of the knives began to spot with rust. We ordered a few new sets on Amazon as replacements, but what came was a different product. At some point, Gorham changed the manufacturer and the newer sets are made in China, not Japan. They are not as weighty and the finish is not as nice -- you can tell right away when you pull them out of the box. It is still a nice set, but the quality is not nearly as good as in prior years. Hopefully they will change the vendor and regain the quality they built their reputation on."
3,Not the same product as I received in 1998,"I have searched for this style of flatware for years and there is a reason you can only find it here. It's nowhere near the same quality as my original set purchased in 1998. The weight is very light - the old set feels substantial in the hand this feels cheap. It still looks good and feels smooth in the hand no rough edges. The stamp is different. On the original spoon it is stamped into the steel on the handle, the new set it is on the back of the spoon in an ink. It also says Vietnam instead of Japan.The shipment arrived fine except that the person who sold it obviously smoked cigarettes as the box and packing material stink of it. I haven't decided what I'm going to do. I need more pieces for the holidays. Maybe it's time to find a new flatware and begin to retire this set. My original set has held up beautifully but I don't think these pieces will."
3,Nice flatware but not dishwasher safe,"This flatware is really nice looking, and it seems to have a good quality. We got them 3 months ago (put them in our wedding registry after analyzing all kinds of flatware) and after a couple times we put it in the dishwasher the knives started to spot with rust. That's pretty disappointing since they said they were ""dishwasher safe""."
5,"brilliant, commonsense book","This would have to be the best Tarot manual I have ever seen. It combines a practical, commonsense approach with a LOT of exercises and practical suggestions. The language is always simple, modern and clear and the lack of individual card illustrations means that it can be used with any 78 card deck. Toward the end, there is an introduction to the Kabbalah and meditation and visualization exercises.In regards to other reader's comments, this book DOES suggest starting with the first two cards of the deck (the ace and two of wands) and learning to combine the two cards in a simple reading, before going on to using three cards and so on and so forth, but there are graded spreads for every level. There is no mention of learning all 78 cards before going on to spreads. It may not be the best thing for people who just ""want a bit of fun"", but it's far and away the best book for people who really want to learn the Tarot."
2,Not a good book for beginners,I have studied tarot for many years. I just recently came across this book from a friend of mine. After reading it I told my friend to ditch it. This book has alot of misinformation in it for the beginner. It's method of study is too hard. Much of the stuff this book has you do is not necessery to read the cards. Look elsewhere for a good study guide for tarot if you are starting out.
5,Classy and Casual,"I just got the pitcher, it really is beautiful and larger than I thought. It has a classy look as well as simple and casual. I saw something similar at an exclusive resort in the Caribbean. I have the Lenox Butler's Pantry plates so this was a natural choice."
2,SilverStone2 East Main 8 inch Skillet,It was dirty and the handles do not match the others purchased. Otherwise it works fine.
1,Do not be fooled.,"this item is not what is pictures. It shows a picture with the numbers lit up , etc. All you get is a little module that is supposed to plug into something. Not what is pictures. They need to change the picture and give a better explanation of what the module is supposed to do. I returned the module immediately for a refund.Buyer beware."
3,Good book if you don't know anything about Chaney,"If you know nothing about the films and career of Lon Chaney Jr., then you will get something out of this book. However, if you are like me (and probably most people who would be interested in reading a book about Lon Chaney Jr.), you already know about his film career and most of the books content is going to be stuff you already know. I wanted to read about his life and times, which it has a little of, but mostly it was overviews of his movies. Personally I would rather just watch the movies instead of reading about them."
1,"A disappointing biography on Lon Chaney, Jr.","There has never been a definitive biography of Lon Chaney, Jr., and this book does nothing to fill that void. Based primarily on other source books, author Don G. Smith displays little eveidence of hard research in this text. It is overladen with long-winded synopses of Chaney Jr.'s films, while the actor's early life, growing up with his father, his mother's attempted suicide and subsequently being lead to believe she was dead are hardly dealt with. It is quite obvious that the author simply pulled a few previously written books and cut-and-pasted the material into his text. A shoddy piece of writing and film research. The filmogrpahy is very minimal, but the TV appearances are well detailed. In all, Lon Chaney, Jr. does deserve a detailed biography. This one isn't it!"
3,This is a fairly good biography of my favorite actor.,"As a Lon Chaney,Jr.fan,I feel that this book,though interesting,leaves one strangely disatisfied at it's conclusion. I really expected much more from this somewhat one-sided biography. The portrait that Mr.Smith provides about Lon Chaney,Jr,is often far too negative."
3,Good that a book was written about Chaney Junior,"I am glad that a book about Lon Chaney Junior has been written. It provides some interviews that can also be found in ""Universal Horrors.""Don Smith goes off base with some of his underdeveloped theories, especially the claim that Creighton Chaney was a ""latent homosexual.""Why bother with such theories?I would have liked to have read more about Chaney's work ethic. The people I met who worked with Lon Chaney Junior, found the actor to be a nice man who suffered from the disease of alcoholism.Disappointing book overall, but a good one to catalog his movies."
5,Ringo is so much fun,"I first bought Sentimental Journey in the early 70s on vinyl and was pleasantly surprised.I was very pleased to see it released on CD!If you are a fan of the Fab Four, this CD is a must. Although Ringo is obviously not a great singer, he is quite enjoyable and fun to listen to. You can tell he was having a great time recording this material and actually does quite well. A very good selection of material and out of all the tracks there were only maybe 2 that I did not particularly care for the arrangement(s), but I would still recommend purchasing this CD.It is one of which I will never tire of listening (and enjoying). Tip of the hat to Ringo for forging on with the project when there was probably not a lot of encouragement. He did well."
2,No No No No I Don't Smoke It No More!!!!!,"How can one possibly think that Ringo expected to pull this off without a little tongue in cheek good humor. Trouble is, there's little found here to laugh or cry about. Ringo sleep walks his way through 10 or more great standards and deftly renders them all unforgettable. Again, I'm left perplexed as to why Ringo put this out....Well maybe....Shall we say....You know....No No No No I Don't Smoke It No More!!!!!!!!! Meanwhile I'm underwhelmed."
5,Sentimental Journey,"Very good CD. Worth every cent! If you want a little cup of sugar and rock n roll, try this! This is Ringo's first solo album. Please buy. It's worth it!"
3,Strange Start to a Solo Career.,"While the other three Beatles used their solo debuts as ""declarations of independence"", Ringo used his debut as a gift for his mom. For that, I tip my hat to him. This collection of tin pan alley standards may not inspire millions to rush out and snatch up every Sinatra album they can find but it does make for pleasant listening. This album deserves to be heard at least once."
4,Take a sentimental journey with Ringo......,"Nice easy listening of old classics. Great for babyboomers who would like to hear songs their parents probably sang along to. I know mine did. Good job, Ringo!"
4,"charming, totally charming, is the word for this album","I reserve 5 star ratings for truly classic albums, so this gets only 4 stars. But it truly is an underrated and overlooked gem. The way Ringo's voice works with the wonderful arrangements and production (George Martin) is perfect, just perfect. This is a great way to expose yourself to some really great pop standards of the first half of the 20 century. Ringo does not disappoint. In fact, the only Ringo albums that are as enjoyable are Ringo, Goodnight Vienna (maybe) and I Wanna Be Santa Claus. OK, and Vertical Man. Ringo forever!"
1,MICHELLE WHO?,"I HAVE A QUESTION, WHY DID I GET THIS AS A SEARCH RESULT FROM WHEN I WAS SEARCHINF FOR MICHELLE WILLIAMS OF DESTINY'S CHILD'S NEW ALBUM WHICH IS BEING RELEASED SOON??? THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DESTINY'S CHILD OR THE MEMBER MICHELLE SO I'M JUST WONDERIN..."
3,We do not use it very often,"As a family of emigrants from Russia living in the US, we've been exposed to Soviet cooking all of our lives. This book has a pleasant collection of recipes coming from all over the former USSR, and it is indeed a great reference for someone who enjoys cooking and has a lot of free time to do it. However, we find that most of the recipes are over-complicated. We make ""kotlety"" and ""bortsch"" quite often, and we have tried the recipes listed in this cookbook for testing. The results were good enough, but not much better than the usual, if at all. The recipes also required much more time and attention to detail than we are used to in making these dishes, and that extra effort didn't seem to pay off. Not a good reference for someone who's into Russian cooking on a day-to-day basis."
2,"Cold Solder Joint, Stripped Screw","That about says it. Channel one was inoperative, cold solder joint, one of the screws was stripped and was a bugger to remove.After repairs it works as advertised. Screw is still stripped.Will not need another."
4,Great (huge) bib!,"People laugh when I pull this bib out, but it does the job! I love to dress my daughters in cute clothing, so bibs are a necessity. This one is nice and big - I keep it in the car and it covers everything but the sleeves."
4,Good film!,This is a very good movie. The complextity of the carachters captured my attention. Chuz Gutierrez made a very good one this time.
1,Waste of Money,"Though this thing is supposed to support 250 pounds (I weigh 200), I'd only been in it 15 minutes the first time I used it and it ripped along the seams. I called the company that sells it (Swimways) and requested a replacement, which arrived within a few days. That one, too, ripped the first time I used it. This is quite possibly the greatest waste of money I've ever spent."
1,POS,"Since I could'nt leave zero stars I give it a 1 because the frame was impressive,too bad that's not the part you lay on.This POS ripped the very first time I used it.Find something made in the USA!China is killing us with their junk."
1,i dont know how some people get record deals,do i even need to go on. that is the WORST rendition of the creston i have ever heard. i have heard undergraduates play it infinitely better. and they can actually play it at the tempo intended by creston. time is only beiginning of things i could stab at this album about.
1,Just awful,"I basically agree with nearly everyone else.His tempo's terrible, his intonation's horrible, and his articulation is pathetic. Following his concept of tempo in the Creston is almost as hard as playing the Dahl - and by that I mean the Dahl as it's meant to be played. And with the Dahl... in his edited version he babbles incessantly about using a sopranino for the ossia passages. It's a shame he didn't follow his own advice."
2,Try Again...,"As stated elsewhere here, there are performance flaws within. Most annoying are the pronounced pitch problems in altisimo passages on the Dahl. It ain't easy, but if one can't pull it off, better to program something else instead. The pianist seems to 'Clam' now and then also.Better recordings exist of these pieces."
3,How reliable is a reference book that has a type-o on the cover?,"The information provided about this book is exactly what I am looking for, but the cover refers to ""Credit Cars"" I'm sure they mean Credit Cards.This is not a good sign."
1,A very special book...,"While the author is a well respected economist, this book is amazingly bad! It does a very poor job explaining the concepts and while people in my MBA class who were proficient in Economics simply avoided it, it made the Microeconomics core class a nightmare for those with no prior background. In my class of 60, everyone disliked it. Don't buy it unless you absolutely have to! Expect long paragraphs of plain text, a very small number of black and white graphs and strange and irrelevant examples which are more confusing rather than helpful.As a fun piece of trivia, I have to mention that in the Introduction the author mentions that this ridiculous textbook was developed based on him teaching Stanford MBAs and thus it may not be intellectually suitable for programs where people come from poorer caliber. Well, I doubt that many schools use it anyway!"
3,my first cookie monster sighting,"I felt ripped off when I got this in a music store. I thought it was going to be a live album (cd). but instead, its a concert dvd with a 6 song cd thrown in. but it was cool to see legendary death metal throat ripper chris barnes on stage. For all my years of listening to the life affirming advice of the great gut-rotted growlers, I have never seen one actually perform."
1,Six feet under-Live with full force,What can I say but this DVD is a real (no money put into it) piece of S#%T!!!!!!!!!!!Buy the double head concert DVD it is real and not crapola!!!!
5,"Koerner's ""Missing Peace of a Heritage Puzzle""","I much appreciated Frank Koerner's ""The Missing Peace of a Heritage Puzzle"". It is a timely work because the author is only one generation away from an outcome of World War II that is not generally well known. Millions of innocent people were expelled from their homelands only because of their Germanic heritage.The concept of ""Collective Guilt"" for Nazi atrocities should be acknowledged and studied while there are still those alive who can speak of it firsthand. This in no way diminishes the suffering of others who were persecuted or who lost their lives because of the Nazis. It is simply another event in history that should be recorded accurately and fairly. In this very personal account, Frank Koerner does this admirably.Madeline Stanley"
4,A Piece of this Heritage Puzzle,"From the front cover through to the final page, Frank Koerner held me captive - for fear of missing a clever, playful treatment of wording or phrasing. What a fantastic, easy, interesting, and fun way to learn about a virtually unknown part of history. When we learn the magnitude of the deportation, I wondered if I missed that week of history class. On that issue and so many others, Mr. Koerner made me feel like a part of the story - no, I didn't miss class, this historically significant event is largely ignored. I loved the vignettes so much that I limited myself to a chapter or two each night, so that the book would last as long as possible. The joy in accompanying Mr. Koerner was exceeded only by the fun accompanying unexpected chuckles (often accompanied by a groan) that popped up with deftly managed wording and phrasing. It's a great read!"
5,Extremely Helpful ~ Great Buy,"I am very picky with my travel guides and I think this was the best purchase I ever made. I expected the beautiful pictures; however, the content was also amazing. I personally prefer more than a 4 line blurb about an attraction and in this book, I found there were amazing detailed descriptions for each place I visited to identify the history, important characteristics and must see items. The maps were very helpful while navigating each district and the recommendations were well suited."
2,Great but has failed twice in 3 years,I would really like to give this sw a 5 star because of the sound quality but unfortunately because of the failure rate maybe a 2 star is too much.You have to have special tools to get the back off.The amp module was replaced under warranty but the unit has failed again.It was working before a left for a few days andupon my return it would not produce any sound.So there you go.I have to cart it off again to a repair shop but it's only 30k away.Good luck if you have to send it to another city.
5,Great Sound,I bought this sub after listening to my brothers. He has the 12 inch version. These subs are built very well and sound amazing. Check out Velodyne's website to learn more about the technology that makes these subs sound so good.
1,Total Ripoff,"Do not waste your money on this piece of junk. It is supposed to update weather forecast for the next 5 days in your area every 15 minutes. In actuality, it updates the weather about every 3 days, and then only if you take the batteries out for 30 seconds and then put them back in. The reset button doesn't do anything. And, it says that batteries last 2-3 months. About 10 days is the norm that I've found out. Right now, it is May 22nd. The last time it updated the weather was May 10th, and I've changed the batteries twice since then. Also, I live in a Chicago suburb, so it's not like I live on a remote desert island or something. I wasted $87 on this as a Christmas gift to my wife. Buyer beware!!!"
1,Unit's receiver broke,"I initially liked this device, a lot. But two weeks ago it stopped receiving data. I called Ambient's support and was told that the receiver electronics have broken, it can not be repaired, and that they will not replace the unit. This is pretty poor customer support for what I thought was a good company. If they turn out products that break and then won't fix them, it tells me a lot about the company and their products. I will not be spending money to buy another unit from Ambient. If you want a weather unit that will last, pick a different product."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,This product did not work at all. It received no signal despite the manufacturers web site indicating full services in my location.
1,Broke After a Month,"After a month of use, the machine developed a crack in a weld on the bottom of the center support and I have been fighting with ProForm ever since. They refuse to do anything about it because I didn't buy it from them directly. Their customer service is the worst I have ever dealt with, it's not so much ""customer service"" as ""company service"". Do me, and yourself a favor, don't buy from ProForm."
2,very noisy,"very complicated to put together - make sure it is assembled or mostly assembled when you order it! there was an option to pay $200 to put it together ....after a few goes, it is SO NOISY - creaks very loudly and i've had complaints from other tenants as it awakes them - so it has proved useless as i could only exercise in the morning.the handle bars slip down whilst in use (not obviously) - you have to screw them to the desired height, but however hard you tighten them, they seem to head downwards.apart from that, if you don't mind the noise and have no immediate neighbours - it will do the job."
5,Wonderful...,"Kazan : Father of Baree, introduces readers to a new level of respect for the wonderful creatures that James Oliver Curwood writes about. Kazan is the story of a wolf hybrid; a mix between a dog and a wolf. The story highlights the adventures of Kazan, as well as lessons taught to him throughout the book. I recommend this story to anyone who enjoys books that revolve around an animal as the main character. The plot is spectacular, as is the writing, and anyone ranging from age 8 to age 88 will enjoy it."
1,disappointed,"I have found this uncomfortable and of no help. I wouldn't get another one, but it may be what you need."
1,doesn't wear well,"had this several days, the leg straps come out of the buckles at the waist.The buckle end of leg strap should have some velcroto attach it back to itself."
1,A piece of crap!,"I purchased this product to try to relieve the pain I was having from my hernia. The straps DO NOT HOLD! They come apart, on average, 6 times a day! (They have already come undone 3 times this morning). DO NOT BUY THIS! It's not worth the money."
4,Big assist!,"This truss got me thru the wait for my surgery. I still had to be careful not to worsen my tear and to make sure my parts stayed where they belonged as my rupture was very large. It worked well for me, the only concern would be the truss is lightly built and needs to be handeled as such. While its not comfortable to wear, its not bad and I wore it all day with few problems. It was a huge help for me and my situation."
3,Could it be easier,I've used it as a support while I do exercise or chop wood. It works well. But the straps that go up and around either don't hold or stay in place. It seems there should be one more piece of velcro to help keep it secure.
4,A good product,I have a Hernia in my lower abdoman and in the next month or so I will have it taken care of. Recently I have encountered pain in my stomach area and decided to resolve this problem before the Hernia. I had many tests for the stomach problem and they all came out O.K. Byaccident I pressed on my Hernia and the stomach problem went away. That's when I sent away for a Hernia belt from Amazon. Now I wear my Hernia Belt until I have my Hernia surgery and my stomach problem has not come back unless I remove the Hernia Belt.
3,Sport aid hernia truss,"This belt works but found to be a litte uncomfortable due to waist band being a little tall rubs on my lower bellie when sitting, no problems when standing. As with all these belts give your self some time when you need to use men's room gettin things adjusted. Not the most comfortable but definitely better than not having support."
4,Biased,"I have to admit that my high rating of this album is mostly because of Pam Grier's presence. I am a huge Pam Grier fan and she can do no wrong. However, the soundtrack is very good because it does a good job of blending 70s music (Blaxploitation) with the ""Tarantino movie sound"" i.e. heavy guitar & rock based. Go back to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. I have an even greater appreication for Bobby Womack who doesn't have the smoothest voice in R&B, but his raspy/scratchy voice is very unique."
3,A bit disappointing,"Basically this is just a word of warning - don't buy this if you are expecting the same quality as that of Pulp Fiction or Resovoir (Sp?) Dogs.The style is the same, but the dialogue excerpts and music is, I feel, just not in the same league as the previous two.Mind you - I felt the same way about the movie too!"
3,delicious,"the songs collected here are all great, but the production value of the cd isnt all that great. it seems sloppy and rushed to me."
5,Just Fantastic,"Tarantino has reproved that he is the master of the movie soundtrack, even when the films are only sub-par."
5,Jackie Brown,The Music from Jackie Brown is the underlieing theme of the movie by Quentin Tarentino.Listening to this music lets you identify with the characters from the movie and where in the movie the music is from.You can just close your eyes and imagine what the characters are doing and their goals.Just great.
5,Quentin's Best Yet!!,"This cd has been in my cd player for over a year now, and I love it. My favorite songs are Holy Matrimony , Long Time Woman by Pam Grier herself, Across 110th Street, Inside my Love, Midnight Confessions......well I'm naming them all, so that should give you an idea of how good this cd is. If that isn't enough to convince you, let me tell you the photo of Quentin Tarantino inside the liner notes is just the stuff dreams are made of. I got my money's worth just for that picture of him!"
4,Jackie Brown has a great sound track.,The music is fantastic. There are a few skits that contain swearing. That was kind of a bummer.
1,Waist of my hard earned money........,poor quality when you get to the 5th song it started bouncing / all scrached up... and I hate having to return items...but will never buy from this source again..lost my money...
3,jackie brown review,"i bought this CD because i wanted the song ""across 110th st""it is the first sond on the disc........i like most of the other songs as well."
3,"Way too expensive, but there is no alternative","This item is much too expensive for what you get, but you have no choice since your forced to use this specific kit for your B&S generator. At least through Amazon it was $50 less than anywhere else I could find it. Functionally it's fine and it's easy to install yourself even though it says you need to have a certified electrician install it. I'm sure that warning was to keep the lawyers happy."
4,"Not what I expected, but still a very good book.","Unlike some of her other books, this one was more ""vanilla"", which was a little disappointing. I also felt that the characters could have been a little more developed. Still all in all, a very good read."
3,Sensual...different.,"3.5 SENSUAL, intense, different. Calling this one PNR but its sorta kinda not really, just don't know which of my categories to list this one under. Lusty romance with Wiccan rituals and an evil spirit."
5,Loved It,"Like the novella ""Chance of a Lifetime,"" this is a relatively light read for Joey Hill. You can always count on Joey to give you heroines you can believe in and heroes you can't wait to dream about (along with some pretty hot love scenes to get you started). This story is far from an exception to that. Other than some bondage in the first chapter, there aren't any BDSM elements, although Justin is a minor character in her BDSM series, Nature of Desire. Just lots of romance and heat with a little magic, both light and dark."
2,Sorry Susan-very disappointing...,"I loved the first Susan Squires book-Danegeld-it was gritty, original and riveting throughout. Unfortunately, despite my high expectations for this novel, I was disappointed. I found the main characters difficult to sympathize with and the plot structure a little awkward. I used to live in the village below the white horse where Ms Squires based her novel and it truly is a mystical magical place. I found the book difficult to read and I have a degree in history, classics and archaelogy so it wasn't that it was beyond me-I hope that she gets back on track with the next one because she truly has an original and unique voice"
2,New Age romance...Dodgey History...Bleh...,"Okay, lessee. We've got the goddess-worshipping white-haired 'just say no to meat' healer/vegetarian heroine and the obligatory Saxon brute hero who kidnaps the unwilling heroine. Does this plot sound familiar? It should, it's the plot used over and over in romance novels from J. Lindsey to Clan of the Cave Bear.Okay, you might say...This is romance. But this plot was just silly. How many books can one read where the nasty Viking kidnaps the silly and oh-so-politically correct pagan priestess? While I like Squires writing in previous works, I had hoped this book would be more than just a 'lovespell-esque' book filled with pseudo-history and psychic healer women. I guess I'm just disappointed. A little research into the lifestyle of ancient Brits might have made these characters really shine."
3,Get an '80s compilation instead...,"People, like me, will buy this for ""She's a Beauty,"" because that's a good song with real '80s flavor, hoping the rest of the songs are good. They aren't. There are only 3 or 4 songs on the disc worth hearing. SO, in conclusion, find a 1980s compilation set that has ""She's a Beauty"" on it. You'll get the song you wanted and a bunch of other songs that are way better than the leftovers on this so-called ""Best"" from The Tubes."
3,"Got these, now where is my favorite ?","This CD is sallright. Not my favorite Tubes tunes but I suppose perhaps some of the more popular ones for the buying masses. The question I have is - Where is the CD with Mingo Lewis on it ? The songs ...My Head is My Only House...(unless it rains) Golden Boy, God-Bird change ? Why is this not available anywhere ? If it is....WHERE ?!?"
2,bad driving info but good restaurant info,"If you are looking for good eating recomendations, this is the book for you. But if you are interested in driving around Maui, especially the Hana Highway, find another book. The driving directions they give -- site-seeing points, where to stop, how to find roads off the highway and especially how to find hiking trails are not good at all. I just returned from a trip to Maui and wished I had another guidebook along. I wish I had bought Maui Revealed, because the Author's Kaui Guidebook was great"
4,Pretty good.,"I just started becoming interested in clip art. I decided to play it safe, and buy this software. It is pretty good, the search engine runs in Windows. The quality of the clip art is great. I can bring the images over to Illustrator, Photoshop, etc... If you are interested in making your own greeting cards, this software is great. One thing that disturbs me though, is the search engine. Why can't the search engine be cross platform to some point...? Maybe a Java application of some sort that would run on Windows, MacOSX, Linux, etc... Java has matured and is very much usable on all platforms."
4,Pill time is so much simpler with pet piller,"This baby really has made my life a lot more pleasant. Just put the pill in the little tip, pull out the plunger, catch the cat, put the pet piller in the back of kitty's mouth, press the plunger, and you are done. The only issue I sometimes have is that smaller pills don't always stay in the little tip (will fall out if I don't hold it right). But that is pretty minor."
5,For pets!,"I was told about this from my vet who did not carry it. I searched all over and finally found it on Amazon. My little doggy had cancer and the amount of pills she had to take was overwhelming, this made it so easy on us both! Just pop it in the mouth and all done. Sadly, she passed right after I received this...but I am going to hold on to it forever!+"
1,Simply terrible for a cat,"Don't buy this for your cat, period. Unless your cat weighs 80 lbs, it's much too large and hard to maneuver into a cat's mouth without choking him."
5,Life saver for our cat,We have to give our cat a pill every day. This would have been impossible without the Pet Piller. Very easy to use and our cat is not bothered by it. Now if only there was an easy way to catch the cat to give her the pill. :)
2,For small pills only,"This is a good idea, but it's not good for bigger pills. Anything larger than the size of 1/2 a tic tac this product doesn't work well with."
1,Don't waste your money,"My cat was recently diagnosed with kidney disease and the vet recommended some capsules for him to take. Although he is a very loving cat, we knew he would ""fight"" having a pill shoved into his mouth, so we searched through reviews and chose this pill pusher. It arrived dirty...don't think it was used, but it was clearly sitting around for a while. It broke the end of the first capsule and we tried it a few more times and eventually decided we were better off giving him the pill by hand. Don't waste your time or money...possibly another brand might work better, but this one was useless."
5,Pill Popper Perfection!,Pill poppers at retail stores for dogs are abundant. It is very difficult to find mini's for cats -hence I turned to the internet. I found this pill popper at a discount and they arrived within a few days in excellent condition (I purchased two). I have a friend with 13 cats who'd never used a popper and gave one to her - it has changed her life! I'm going to order a couple more...
3,It's Okay,"Good for small pills for all animals, but not to be of long use for big pills. The rubber end will not hold onto big pills after a lot of use."
4,Good for small pills,"This product is good for most feline medications. However, the liver supplement I needed to give my cat was not compatible with the product. If the pill you need to administer is large and oval-shaped, avoid this product."
1,Pet Pill Dispenser,"The pill dispenser is too large to use to dispense medication to my cat. It is too long, probably better for a dog. I am afraid my cat would choke."
2,not the greatest,i suppose technically it works but it is awkward and not much better than just using a finger. Plus the cat sees it coming and knows what's next.
1,Unpackaged Garbage: Do not buy,"This item was sent from the seller in an envelope with no packaging, instructions, etc.Personally, I am extremely picky about what I use for my pets' health and don't feel comfortable using something that I have no way of knowing whether or not it has been previously used & returned, how it was stored, etc.Aside from that, I have no idea how to use the thing. It doesn't seem to hold the pill in place without carefully balancing it, and then the ""shooting"" mechanism does nothing.Unfortunately this is ""fulfilled by Amazon"", so returning it involves paying return shipping expenses & a 20% restock fee.Actually, if after reading this review you are still interested, I'll send you mine for free. If I have to pay for shipping anyhow, I'd rather it go to someone with an honest need, than a merchant who takes no responsibility for peddling crap."
4,dPhilc's Review,Short tome to help understand an obscure aspect of European history. It is useful help us understand certain aspects of the psychology of those involved. It makes an interesting hint at the reason that so many women were burned but does not pursue that link of enquiry.
4,WONDERFUL ALBUM!,"ANY album that features Duane Allman makes it special. TO BONNIE FROM DELANEY is no exception. A very underrated album that should be noticed by not only just the Duane Allman fan, but for music lovers from all over. GET THAT ALBUM!"
5,the best,"What can you say.These 2 were the top tier who everyone else wanted to be. They did'nt demand or ask for respect, they just recieved it. You wont be disappointed in this 12 song set and friends.......support your favorite artists."
5,AMAZING QUALITY,"I saw this book and had to have it. Seller said was in Used-Very Good condition and they were not lying. I had a 1985 print date and it still had the duskjacket on it. Now the duskjacket had wear you would expect on a 27 year old book, but still it was in very good shape. The rest of the book looks like it had never been opened and sat on a shelf waiting for me to purchase it. Great collectors item, or if you don't mind you could also cut out the images and frame them.I really liked that it showed a lot of the process of a print from drawing to final, and they had a lot of pull out pages that made really nice big pictures."
4,A Pleasing Historical,"Welsh landowner Caradoc is desperate to save his manor house when Scotswoman Fiona MacDougal appears on his doorstep with an offer he can't refuse. Marry her, and he'll acquire her considerable dowry. It would be enough to clear his debts and pay his taxes. How can he turn her down? Never mind that the lovely redhead tempts him with her sensual looks and curvaceous form. Can he do what's right for his people even knowing they'll disapprove? Can Fiona earn their regard and quell the whispers about her past? You'll root for this earnest woman to win Caradoc's heart and his people's praise."
1,Simon would have a hayday with this,"Don't waste your money.If you want to hear JD Peterson at her bestbuy RHYTHM OF THE DREAMThis is not how you want to hear JD Peterson - You want to hear the real JD Peterson, buy Rythm of the Dream"
4,"Good Toner, Funky Blue Color","Seems like a great toner, not overly drying, great minty smell. You can really see the dirt when you clean with a pad. It has a bright blue hue, kinda like mouthwash which is a little odd but besides that great product. I have pretty oily skin though, not sure how it would work for people with dry skin, no alcohol is nice."
5,Essential account of Lacan's influence on narrative studies,"This essential account of Lacan's influence on narrative studies is not to be missed. High points include Jeffrey Mehlman's essay, and Jerry Aline Flieger's treatment of joke theory as narrative paradigm. All the essays are remarkably readable, which is refreshing for a book on Lacan."
2,"Nice try, but not enough to hold onto","I thought this bowl would be great for my little girl, she's 11 months. I would have a place to put her food and she couldn't throw the bowl from her tray. Wrong, it doesn't have enough suction hold, so within a matter of a minute she has it off and throws it to the ground. Bottom line, save your money."
5,Quality Product,"If you know how to use screwdrivers, drills, hand saw, and a level, you can put this together. It took a little time to read the instructions over and over, but really there a just a few critical measurments, the rest is somewhat forgiving. Just don't go cutting all you wood up all at once. Cut as you need to and double check the measurments. Took about 4 hours to properly install, first timer. Thinking about doing another! I would buy this product or one similar again."
2,Need patience and it might be better to build your own.,We read the reviews and this seemed like a good option. After several hours of installation it does look nice but I'm not sure it was worth it. It is certainly better than the particle board or wire closet systems. This is not a beginner project unless you have extreme patience. Not only is there no room for error with some of the measurements and leveling there is cutting involved. When we finely finished I felt like I could have spent the same amount of time and less money to design and build my own closet system that would have been better suited to our needs.
3,"Looks good , but a bear to install","This product looks good when finally installed, but it will take some time to install properly. I have basic carpentry skills and it took me about 10 hrs to plan the design and install. The product quality is nice, I had no problems with scratching the finish or splitting the wood (predrilling is necessary)."
5,Good value,"This closet kit is not difficult to install if you have some DIY skills and take the time to read the instructions. I agree with other reviews that the wood is soft, which is really only an issue when handling it during the installation. Once installed, the closet system looks good and is quite sturdy. All in all, when you supply your own labor, the value of the system is very good."
4,John Louis Home Closet Shelving System,"Great Closet organization! I had been looking at several different systems for our new home and settled on John Louis after reading other reviews. I ordered and received 2 systems, one for my closet and one for my husband's. My nephew installed them and we have been very happy with them."
1,Very disappointed!,"I was very disappointed in the Revelations movie. I had a hard time staying focused on the movie, as it jumped around too much and the characters were not believable. I'm sorry to say I would not recommend this movie and I found it to be a waste of time; it also left you hanging."
1,THE WORSE BOOK EVER WRITTEN,"THIS BOOK IS AN OUTRAGEOUS COPY AND SYNOPSIS OF FAMOUS AUTHORS WORK. WHEN I FIRST READ THIS BOOK I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZED FAMOUS QUOTES AND PARAGRAPHS OF FAMOUS WRITERS OF AMERICAN HISTORY. A BOOK NOT ORIGINAL. DID NOT SHOW EXCITMENT OR HIGH KNOWLEDGE IN HISTORY. I WOULD NOT SPEND MY MONEY BUYING THIS ""BOOK."""
4,Important Work,"For Black Americans, Timothy Jenkins and Khafra K Omrazeti have performed a very important service. With an insightful foreword by former UN Ambassador Andrew Young, Jenkins and Omrazeti have combined their considerable talents and insights to create the case for black Americans to advance into the future using their intellect and technology to create new and untold opportunities for Black Americans. The book is well researched and draws upon the work of successful black technologists and scientists who in the past, leapt ahead of their time to make important contributions to the world at large. This book is easy to read and will serve as an excellent foundation for understanding how we arrived where we are, and more importantly it highlights some of the challenges Blacks will face in the future unless current leadership undergoes a change in consciousness."
4,amazon.com travelers 3,"This was a surprise to me, I came from Oregon and have lived in New York since 1969. I never knew there was a group like this at Oregon University. It is a really fun and well made recording"
5,Must-Read for any Chicago collector,"This book presents Chicago's nineteenth century history with great clarity. It's the kind of read that stays with you. Chicago's history is surprisingly recent,and the people involved in the growth and flourishing of this city have been shown in Miller's book in a way that brings these people alive. As a lifelong Chicago resident, I feel I know my city much better thanks to this excellent, fast-paced book. I now know where the Chicago Fire burned, where buildings long gone used to stand, etc. It is fascinating for anyone who wants to understand Chicago better. PS -- I wish Miller would do one of the twentieth century Chicago."
5,Comprehensive and Yet Extremely Entertaining,"I want to echo the rave reviews this book has gotten. I just finished it tonight. Wonderful stories, insightful analysis. It makes you think past the usual chicago folklore that many of us city dwellers have come to accept as fact. I highly reccomend this to anyone interested in chicago or the growth of urban america in the 19th century."
5,Very comprehensive !,I have read dozens of books on Chicago history. This book is by far the best. Can't imagine one being any better.
2,I just couldn't get into it,"I'm sure this is a great reference book, but I just couldn't get into it. Never actually finished it, unfortunately."
3,Gift book.,Recipient loved it. It was purchased from recipient's wish list so couldn't go wrong with my choice. I would have checked out from library if I wanted to read something like this.
2,Boring,"This book was not what I expected. I found the details tedious and boring. Not enough coverage of the most historical event in Chicago's history, the fire and the subsequent rebuilding. I fairness, I was so disinterested I did not finish the second half... I kept falling asleep. John Dwaine/ Chicago"
2,Disjoined and disappointing,"I was not impressed with this book. The glowing reviews are a mystery to me. Miller seemed to begin one train of thought jump to another and back again. The lack of organization was overwhelming. The dry, unexpressive writing was disappointing. As a text this is muddled, as ""engrosing non-fiction"" utterly lacking. Furthermore, this book was extremely long. The length is not necessarily a negative in itself, but it is when it seems that nothing of substance is being said. The length of this book can be attributed to the constant reiteration and the poor organization. Pure facts are as difficult to weed out as it is to understand the structure. Very disappointing."
4,Fancy Vegetables,"This book shows you how to create elegant vegetable dishes. It focuses on both main, side and salad dishes. Most items are time consuming to make but the book does offer advance preparation and final steps for each recipe. About 1/3 of the recipes have pictures. This is not a book for quick and easy vegetable recipes but a book for those who want to go beyond the basics."
4,a story of passionate love,"Cheri tells a story of the end of a six years affair between a middle-age woman, Lea, and a young man, Cheri. The funny thing is that stereotypes are turned upside-down, it is Cheri who wears silk pyjamas and Lea's pearls. He is the object of gaze and Lea gives him lessons in love. But Cheri marries a young woman looking for her money and Lea is emotionally destroyed. The story continues in The Last Of Cheri, written six years later, which contrasts Lea's strength and Cheri's fragility. The two books recount the rise and fall of a spoiled, capricious and handsome man, who already as a child was called ""petit chef-d'oeuvre"" by the American ladies. The end is perhaps the punishment to passionate love, a feeling which seems to be condemned for the author as well."
4,Warning! This book gives away the tooth fairy!,"Johanna Hurwitz is an excellent author, the chapters are quick and easy reads, perfect for children beginning chapter books or for bedtime read alouds. However, in this book (second to the last chapter) please be aware that the truth about the tooth fairy is revealed. For some children, it may not be a problem, but for others in the intended age group it could be disturbing."
1,completely irresponsible,"When you are reading to your small children at night and, despite being pretty sleepy, they're hanging onto the story because the main character has lost a tooth and is waiting in bed, in the dark, for the tooth fairy, the last thing you want to realize is that the story is about to blow open the tooth fairy thing. (Which is all I'll say here, in case kids are reading the reviews). This lasted several pages and was, in my opinion, completely irresponsible of the author. The book also started with some weird hang-up about Halloween, but a book for 6-9 years olds should assume a certain set of beliefs and respect them and be written accordingly."
1,Little Children's Worst Nightmare,I can't believe a children's author would be so insensitive as to totally disillusion children like Johanna H. did!!! She should be ashamed of herself!!! She needs to take into consideration her audience and their age...6-9 year olds!! Does she not realize that this is the age when they are bombarded with so many negative images and influences and Johanna trying to take one of the last few things children believe in is disheartening. I made the mistake of ordering several of her books before reading any reviews about them...now I plan on pre-reading the books myself to make sure Ms. H isn't up to her tricks of treason...
4,Classic satire,"Comedy satire of the Nixon presidency, made in the time before that presidency became just _too_ strange and didn't need satirists any more. David Frye had gained fame on the Smothers Brothers hour and other TV shows with his dead-on Nixon voice and biting wit (much more biting than Rich Little). Very funny, and a time capsule to boot, as Frye nails down a whole boatload of early-70s political and pop culture voices on these two LPs. I give ""I Am the President"" 4 1/2 stars, ""Radio Free Nixon"" maybe 3 1/2. Together they are not quite the classic that is Vaughn Meader's ""The First Family"" (the album that created the genre), but a fun look back at a crazy time."
3,Misleading Advertisement,"These items (4 available) were listed as ""new"". When I opened the box the 4 items were mailed in, it was not well packed for such delicate items. The most distressing part though was that each individual box was marked ""damaged"".I would never have ordered this type of product if I had known it was ""damaged"", and this certainly was not indicated in the listing!"
4,Worth the $$,It's not a bad size and the silver does not smudge as quickly as I expected it to. The flower on top is large and can get intrusive if you have a small counter when opening. Otherwise it's not for the price.
1,Not a good product,"The box was of inferior quality and was damaged on receipt. One of the ""crystal"" rose petals had fallen off the lid. I returned it to Amazon but have heard nothing yet. This is one of those things that ""looks good on paper""."
5,Just What I wanted,This cake topper is beautiful! It seems to be the perfect size and I can't wait to use it on our cake in June. I also plan to either make it into an ornament or just display it in our living room.
4,A Family Story,"In Rituals of the Season, Margaret Maron focuses largely on family- Deborah Knott's huge, extended family and her new family with her upcoming wedding to Dwight Bryant. There is a mystery involving the shooting of an Assistant district Attorney, and another mystery involving the conviction of a local woman who was sentenced to Death Row for clubbing her stepson to death with a softball bat. However, these are peripheral to the hustle and bustle surrounding a Christmas wedding.I did find myself getting lost in the numerous cast of characters many times-- Maron helpfully put a family tree type chart at the beginning of the book showing all of Deborah's brothers and their families but the chart did not account for all the cousins and aunts and uncles and friends and other attorneys and sheriff's department personnel-- I had to constantly flip pages back to figure out who anybody was.Other than that, it's an enjoyable book-- although it's really not much of a mystery."
5,Feels like coming home.,Margaret Maron writes the greatest book of southern fiction of all time. They are written smoothly and read as easily. I love her stories. Deborah and Dwight are the sweetest couple.
4,"Doesn't disappoint, but it lacks something.....","#11 of the Deborah Knott series-I have read 9 of the series just this year. Mostly because this was a bookclub book and I made it a point to read all the books that led up to #11. This was a critical book for the series. Deborah ties the ""knot"" in this one. I enjoyed the Knott story and the mystery wasn't bad either. An ADA is shot while driving in her car and her adopted daughter dies in the crash. Dwight is working the murder and of course, Deborah is involved as usual. A third mystery is added to the mix because, Tracey, the murdered ADA, was looking into a case where the convicted murderer (a female) is currently on death-row. The question is, did she really do it? Two young law students are reviewing the case and Deborah gets involved because, like almost every other character in the series, they are distantly related to her some how. I enjoyed the book. I thought the mystery and the storyline blended well. However, it wasn't spectacular"
2,Judge Knott Drags Us to the Alter,"RITUALS OF THE SEASON, at number eleven in the Judge Deborah Knott series by Margaret Maron should have been stopped with the words, ""If anyone knows why this couple should not be married. They should now speak.""The series dug its own grave from a beginning, which won every major award to an effort that does not deserve the word effort. When an author loses interest in their characters the public is soon to follow.This one and those that followed it should have been left in the computer and the time spent on developing a new series before the author lost her loyal fan base.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS."
3,Overuse of color,"Have thoroughly enjoyed the Deborah Knott series, but I simply do not remember any of her other books mentioning the character's race. What did it add to the story to tell us that one deputy was black and two were white? Race had nothing to do with the story...I mean, this was not a story about lynchings or the KuKluxKlan. But we had to learn that Ernie was black, the trailer park was mostly white, Zack, Kayra, Cyl were black but most others were not. If there was a reason for these differentiations, I totally missed it, and they detracted and distracted from the story. 4 stars for the plot, 2 stars for the perplexity."
3,good work,It is a very decent mystery and the action takes place in an exotic locale (I am living in MA). What else one would ask for?
4,Thoughtful insight,I didn't really know what to expect from this book. I have gotten so much out of it. It is a book that makes you think about why women act and behave the way they do. It also help me realize I wasn't the only woman feeling certain ways. Peggy Orenstein has put into words how I feel. I feel like I am with her on her interviews of the different women to whom she speaks and are in her book.
3,Take this book with a grain of salt,"FLUX purports to be a book about the choices women make in their lives. But I found it mostly to be a lament about the difficulty of making those choices, particularly the choice to bear children or not. The overwhelming tone is one of misery and regret that the white Yuppie women it profiles turned out not to be able to ""have it all"" after all. Even the women whose stories turned out well seem to be hung with an air of tragic drama. It's not necessary to be constantluy frazzled and conflicted, as this book suggests is Woman's lot (mostly the author's own feelings bleeding through, I believe.) I'm a 36-year-old woman, married, childfree and working and I think it's great! I encourage other young women who are confused or conflicted to considerr the childfree path as well."
2,A Well Ilustrated but Dully Written Book,"This book was very well illustrated. The pictures matched perfectly with the words. The book had an interesting topic, but the way it was written made it boring. The vocabulaary was a little higher than the vocabulary of a child who would be atracted to this book."
3,Good for serious fans of tattoo,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who appreciates the art of tattoo. The subject matter is much more varied & interesting than that found in newsstand tattoo magazines.There are 128 pages of high quality photos on heavy stock. These include many close-ups of beautifully & intricately tattooed people. Also, many tattoo artists from around the world are shown working.One of the most interesting features of the book is several pages of old clippings and cartoons. There are some fascinating and bizarre stories here. Otherwise, there is no text. Sources & tattoo artists are listed in the back.The book does contain some nudity, but it is not overwhelming. The emphasis is on the art. The variety here makes it exciting to turn each page."
2,It was okay...could've been better,"While the first few chapters seemed to hold my interest, I found myself rather annoyed with most of the book. Harrison Montgomery made me angry with his pestering questions. Charlotte was a great character, and wondering who was picking off the travelers one by one was at first a good mystery, but lacked thrill and suspense after Mr. Montgomery seemed to figure it out halfway through the book. I enjoy Regency Romances, but this one I did not."
2,False Title,there was only once section in it about how to preach without notes. the rest was sermon preperation and keeping track of your sermons. Further more it only had one example and it wasn't very good.
3,Learn new techniques for old problems,"If you have ever struggled with preaching notes, then this book will show you new ideas of dealing with memory,page summary,cue cards and more. it has help me fine tune my notes and to often preach without them."
4,Fundamentalist Writing,This is a recommended text of a family member. This was recommended as a good text to use in writing both sermons and research papers. This is a pretty good text. It comes from the old school method of training Preachers. It does a good job with basic Sermonoloy and Homelitics.
2,"Not really a study guide, more of a brief overview...","Although ok for a quick scan of the material the night before the test, this book is by no means, nor does it claim to be (if you read the intro instead of the book title - lol!) an end-all cert guide. Use other books for the real knowledge, this for review only."
5,Great modern recording,"Thomas Stevens is one of the best modern players putting out recordings. Excellent sound, impeccable technique, and solid style make the album a staple for any collection. The George Antheil Sonata is particularly good, graceful and exciting. The Hans Werner Henze is also worth hearing, and the New Carnival of Venice is interesting and amusing."
4,Nice shoes...,"Great pair of shoes. However, the laces were extremely awful. One good tug and they rip right off... I had to replace the laces immediately after some creative lacing in a pinch."
1,Early Warning System????,IS this really an Early warning system?? It isn't!It did give me an early warning when the cop was a few feet away. Don't buy this. Waste of money!!!1
2,Functional for its price,I bought this as a fancy add on for my car. I rarely if ever speed so its basically pointless for me. But its a pretty decent unit for its price. Easy to set up and use and works well. Although i'd trade it with someone for 20 bucks :)
1,What's a nine-letter word for BAD?,"Torturous. Not only is this book not for the crossword dillettante, it should be a disappointment to the hardcore solver whose only delight perhaps might come from seeing his friends' names in print.A haphazardly constructed tome, ""Crossword Collection"" is little more than transcribed interviews with the crossword world's major players and reads like a book in search of an editor. It's as if Amende did all the research for the book and then chose not to write one. There's something to be said for letting the people interviewed speak for themselves, but a little editing is in order as quote after quote after quote sucks the life out what must be an interesting group of people.There's something disappointing when a good idea for a book is poorly executed. For a well-written, humorous look at a similar world, stick to ""Word Freak,"" Fatsis' book about competitive Scrabble."
1,A waste of time,Don' bother to buy the book. Anyone can send a survey to people of like minds then use their replies to write a book. I was very disappointed n the contents of the book but glad that I had purchased it used not new.
3,A solution to the gift problem,"A great gift for crossword puzzle fans. I have enjoyed reading it, as have those to whom I have sent it. You will too!"
1,"This Is A Transcription, Not A Book","This is a tedious book. It is a compilation of raw data that hasn't been refined. The author splices and dices transcripts of surveys results which are then arranged in categories. But she fails to flesh out the story. There are some interesting facts and figures, but overall, I'm sorry I bought it. I love crosswords, but this book was a let down."
2,Tough going,This is a very detailed book and in my opinion is not for you unless you have a bit of a background in Law.
5,Dreamy Old English Tarot!,"This wonderful ""pastelly"" deck inspires you to dream and meditate. It is easy to lose yourself amongst the Knights and farmers of this deck! As a sucker for medieval things, this deck was the natural choice for me once I saw it. And it way works better for me than my old, too-modern-feel ""Cosmic Tarot"" deck. Buy it and dream on."
4,Interesting movie,This was an interesting movie with good performances by Hillary Swank and Sam Rockwell. Even more interesting if you look into the real story.
4,Patience is a virtue,"Moving rendition of the true story of Kenneth Waters, who was wrongly convicted of murder in 1983 and served 18 years in prison before being exonerated. If you've ever questioned devotion to another or belief in the truth, this movie will inspire you."
5,Liberating,"This is a story that need to be told! This is happening to often and no one acts, no one listens to defendants, and and not enough people care that legalism is stealing liberty! I would encourage everyone to watch this film. Also go to the innocenceproject.org website and see how you can get involved!"
5,Excellent film,Enjoyed the performance of both Swank and Rockwell as brother and sister with a special bond together as well - brilliant.
4,"decent kept my attention, few things i'd of added though","i liked it it was good not boring not really hard to fallow at all just a few minor things i'd of added the day i seen it we had a power faileure so i could n't rea everythign popped up at end of movie so maybe it mentiond what i though shoudl of been added but the acting was good the story was good, wish it showed his daughter alittle more asking about daddy or thing involving his mother or few more scenes of waht it was liek for him them 18 yrs it showed a few visits with him and sister but just thought a few mroe scene of him his life what he had to do all them long 24 hr days read, write, it showed some just thought shoudl of shown just about 10-15 minute more of various thing other than that it was good, decent and liked it"
2,"How to Make Thousands of Dollars Promoting Comedy, Concerts","I was disappointed in this little book. First of all, for [$] I thought I was getting something really substantial. It is a small paperback book with very little pages. I will admit that there is quite a lot of information in this book but I don't think it is such a great guide for someone fresh into the business."
4,Hitler's Flying Saucers: A Guide to German Flying Discs of the Second World War,I have been investigating German flying discs recently and I found this book to be the most informative and chronologically-correct of any others I have read. This book provides a coherent narrative of the development and deployment of the German discs prior to and during WWII and furnishes some ideas about their fate during the post-war time period. It is a well-researched documentation of what IS known about the subject and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.
2,Ripoff of Ernst Zundel's book,"Ripoff of Ernst Zundel's book: ""UFOs: Secret Weapon of the Luftwaffe?"".Spotty information, and no info of the STEALTH fighter plane in the Smithsonian museum. IN his defense, there just isn't too much info on the subject available."
3,"ZAP, POW and other appropriate sound effects.","""As the hum of a great engine filled the air, cirlces of shadow crawled along the ground indicating a great, flying shape up above.""While a small division of Hitler's army was equiped with flying saucers, he failed to discover the technology for disk mounted laser cannons. If you're going to build an army and use flying saucers as part of your militia, one MUST outfit them with giant lasers!Yes, I know that back in the 40's even having built a flying saucer was quite impressive. However, there is not a single report of a UFO landing and dispensing men dressed in space suits.I was dissapointed with this book in as much as it did not even explain the detailed inner workings of such an aircraft and the photographs failed to deliver reference for the ion thruster that I am currently trying to build.Nice try, Hitler guy...oh, and when you build a flying saucer it needs to have blinking lights ALL along the outside. Duh!-Dr. SteelWorld Domination Toys Inc."
5,Hitler's Flying Saucers,"Truth is stranger than fiction and even more so when it is true. Do the research. There are E.T.'s and the proof is out there. You just have to follow the trails. Look at Antarctica and Admiral Byrd's expedition where the German/Nazi secret bases were kept even after the war. Take it from me, there is something to this book and I am former law enforcement and I also had a Top Secret clearance while in the U.S. Secret Service.Signed, John Carman, john.a.carman@gmail.com"
5,Amazing,This is a well written and informative book. Even if only half of it is true it is still astonishing. Easy to read with well presented reasoning. After reading each chapter on a different technology it is easy to forward think and see present technology was built on top of some of this research. very good.
5,A MUST HAVE for any child of the 80's,"I didn't particularly care for the movie, but this soundtrack is AWESOME! What a flashback - it's better than one of those ""Best of the 80's"" CD's you see on late night TV! (And a lot less expensive) What a terrific value for a CD of this caliber! Fantastic!"
4,A must have for all 80s fans!,"This cd is a great collection of tunes from my childhood. Any product of the 80s would find these songs enjoyable, as well as a reminder of where we once were. They are fun and full of energy! My favorites are ""Rapper's Delight"" and ""Somebody Kill Me."" The last one is a little newer than the others, but it is just as funny! If you like this one, the 2nd cd from the movie is even better! Even if you didn't see the flick, or saw it and didn't care for it, this collection is a must-have for all ages!"
2,"Good music, however, not the real soundtrack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This album along with volume 2 do have good songs. But half of them are not even hardly played in the song. They may have played maybe 2 notes from the song, but yet it's on the soundtrack. And also, it has Culture Club singing ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me"" The soundtrack should have featured Alexis Arquette the actor who sang it in the movie. Also Madonna's song ""Holiday"" was sung by Adam Sandler along with ""Love Stinks"" and ""You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)"" These all should have been Adam Sandler singing them on the soundtrack. But if you are looking for something with a good mix of 80's songs this is a great album for it. JUST NOT THE REAL SOUNDTRACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,thought there would be more songs from the movie on it. you have to buy a second cd to get the rest.,thought there would be more songs from the movie on it. you have to buy a second cd to get the rest.
4,the singer,the sound track was good.i love the 80's.and my wife liked it too.the songs take u back a little.so if u love the 80's i reccomend it to you.the movie was funny as well.
4,One of the songs I'm looking for ...,"... isn't on this collection. OR 'Vol. 2' of this soundtrack series. If only The Cure's ""Boy's Don't Cry"" (in the film, it is playing in the background during the scene when Robby's best friend, Sammy, is visiting him in his basement apartment) was on either the first or second soundtrack disc of this film, there wouldn't be hesitancy to purchase (nor would there be this review, so there's the upside!). Seriously, I'm still gonna get both these discs. However, the only reason I can figure that The Cure is not on these is licensing issues."
3,Happy customer,CD looked pretty bad on the back but it plays without problems. It had me worried at first but overall I am a happy customer.
2,Not exactly what I expected,"I love this movie and love the songs played during it. However, what I discovered was that the songs had either been altered or truncated for the movie and there are many of these songs that have cussing. I don't go for swearing, especially in music, so I was dissapointed."
1,SAVE YOUR FIFTEEN BUCKS,"Save your fifteen bucks, or better yet go down to the nearest Karaoke Bar and buy yourself a couple of stiff drinks. Unless you want a long ride back to the eighties, avoid this album."
4,great CD!!,The Wedding Singer Soundtrack is one of my favorite. It has alot of great songs and is a must for all of you 80's lovers.
4,Hey! Where's the music?,"This was a great cd. So was the second one. However, one thing both of them lack is all the music. ""Hungry Heart"", and Adam Sandler's version of ""You Spin Me Round"", ""Holiday"", Love Stinks"", ""Material Girl (or boy)"" and ""That's All"" are not in either of them. Neither is Ellen Dow's version of ""Till THere Was You."" Other songs like ""Do You Believe in Love"" (Huey Lewis and the News), ""Miami Vice"" TV show theme (Jan Hammer), ""All Night Long"" (Lionel Richie), ""The Goofball Brothers"" (Sorcerer), ""99 Luft Balloons"" (Nena), ""Boys Don't Cry"" (The Cure), ""Jam on It"" (Newcleus), and many others. Another ""Wedding Singer"" soundtrack should definitly be produced."
5,A blast from the past!!!,It reminds you just how good the music was back in the 80's. Fantastic - more of the same please!
3,If you like the movie the sound track is fun,I don't often buy sound tracks but this movie is fun and I like the songs but not enough to buy the CD's of the artists envolved here.
1,Kindle Price More than Hardback Price,I have to agree with the people who are complaining about the Kindle price being higher than the hardback price. Is the publisher trying to take advantage of those who prefer to use the Kindle? It isn't as though this is a new book. As soon as somebody straightens out the pricing situation then I will add these books to my collection.
3,Bosch Novels Okay,Black Echo was pretty good. The Black Ice was really good but the The concrete was really slow to get started.
1,3 in 1,"This is a great deal the only problem is the book is so heavy it is hard to hold and read for any time. I gave it to the American V.V. maybe someone will enjoy it, I didn't"
3,Good Reads- Bad language,"I really enjoy Michael Connelly. These three books have some nice twists and are very good reads. Harry is a great character and almost makes me like cops (at least Harry) because of his compassion and honesty and desire to serve and protect.However, the drawback for me on these books is the language. Seriously!!! How many times do we really need to use the F Bomb! It's overkill and degrading to Connelly and the series. I mean really, pick a few of the other swear words occasionally. Most people I know don't talk like that and it demonstrates lack of education and lack of creativity."
2,Small Small Print,"If you have trouble reading small print, don't buy this. It is not the typical typeface....much much smaller. It's like the small print on bottles."
4,Bosch novel trilogy,"I loved downloading three books in one to my kindle. It gave me great variety and flexibility and buying the trilogy was cheaper than buying them individually. I liked the stories, too."
4,the harry bosch novels. vol. 1,"a great way for a new harry bosch fan to catch up with his past novels. read the drop first, then proceeded with this volume 1. some reviews were correct, you don't have to read them in order to be up to date. i like that about these novels."
4,3 books in one--love it--the pricing not so much!,"The books were really good. Fast read, almost as good as James Patterson, but sorry nobody comes close to James Patterson. The pricing is kinda crazy, when you can buy the hardback for less than the Kindle price. If it wasn't for the convenience of the Kindle, I would be purchasing the hardback. This needs to be corrected, and soon!"
1,Was to heavy to hold and boreing,"made a mistake, didn't realized three stories in in one big heavy book. to hard to handle The Black Echo was to long and boring. didn't read it all. finally just put it away Had to give my hands a rest, it really is heavy. Bring back michael Halley novels"
1,Kindle edition more than hardcover???,"Surely, the publisher is joking. Why would books that are far from new releases be more costly in electronic format than in hardcover. There are no shipping costs, no printing costs, certainly no new marketing costs. This is simply a rip off for Kindle customers--some of the most serious and prolific readers around. Part of the reason for me to purchase a Kindle was the reduced cost of new books (remember $9.99 new releases???). Now, most new releases are $12.99 and more. Charging more for re-releases of old books than for the actually books themselves is ridiculous. Bring the price down! We know it doesn't cost more for an electronic book, so why would we pay more????"
1,unsatisfyed,"The books I ordered were NOT the ones I recieved. I contacted them by e-mail, and got no reply. Was very dissapointed"
5,"Michael Connelly, The Harry Bosch Novels, The Black Echo, The Black Ice, The Concrete Blonde",All three stories were well written and kept my interst from beginning to the end of the story. Had some good change ups and twists built in. Will read more of Connelly's novels.
4,Good Read,Michael Connelly was recommended by a friend and I must agree his stories are a good ready. I find his stories hold your interest and have unexpected endings. I love good a good mystery and these are good.
3,A Tomb,"Michael is one of my faves and I enjoyed all the books but I won't buy 3 books in 1 again. It was very thick and heavy. However the novels were great. I love the Harry Bosch character but wish he would get a little backbone when it comes to women. His stories are always plotted out very well and difficult to put down (unless it weighs a ton) and you get the feeling the characters are so real you could actually be neighbors with them. I often wonder about Police Chiefs such as his (Irving)> I have known a few in my vast years and I would say most of them are the same. What a shame. However; kudos to Connelly and may he keep writing such interesting books. I highly recommend all three books, just one at a time."
3,the Black Echo,I'm still working on the first of the three books in this threesome. Black Echo is a little more convoluted than my tastes. I'm looking forward to the next two when I finally finish Black Echo.
1,Kindle Price,I would love to buy the kindle version of this book but not at this price. There are too many books available at a fair price to purchase this series.
1,Kindle version grossly over priced,I was looking forward to reading this author's material until I noticed the publisher priced the kindle version significantly higher than hardbound copies.
1,Voice of dissent,"Sorry, but I gotta call 'em like I hear 'em.First of all, the sound of the recording itself is amateurish. It sounds like it was recorded in a public restroom. Also, the editing is clearly audible in several places.As for the playing... Well, the altissimo is out of tune, the articulation is needlessly percussive. There are other things I could take issue with, but they're more a matter of personal taste. Much of the music is forgettable, but at least he's not recording the same old saxophone standards -- only a couple are here.There's much better saxophone playing to be found on recordings by Delangle, Bornkamp, Pettersson, Rousseau, Radnofsky, Tse, Fourmeau, Louie..."
4,Excellent story of culture,"Highly recommend this book, especially cultural historians. It is amazing to read the blend of Island and British culture."
2,Warning: Magic Decoder Ring Not Included,"As a graduate student in history, I was intrigued by Sahlins subject. However, Sahlins does his best to hide his subject from any reader not in ""the club"" -- i.e. anyone who does not speak the jargon of a structuralist (or post-structuralist) anthropologist. Sahlins is a very inaccessible (and is thus, by most rules of writing, a BAD) writer, whose elitist attitude negates any interest I may have had in his subject matter."
5,Open Systems and the Rejeuvenation of Structuralism,"This book is thoroughly researched, and intelligent. It is simultaneously an account of the history of Hawai'i's integration into the world economy, a reminder of the complexity of social change in colonial contexts, and a rekindling of the beauty of structuralism"
5,Quick to send.,I received the product promptly and enjoyed the results immediately. Great book thus far. Need to read it more slowly.
4,highly recommended,"This cd is full of great songs. I was really impressed with K Spacey's version of ""that old black magic""...what a pro. I have the movie on both dvd and tape (somewhere) as well as the book, but what I revisit more than all of those is this soundtrack. This is a throwback to when songs had depth and soul, as opposed to the slick singles that you hear on the radio these days. Basically, to sum it all up, if you want to own a timeless collection of songs, then buy this cd.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is b/c of Eastwood's song."
4,Midnight's music,"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil was such a good film and the music so interesting, it was great to hear the music separately after seeing the film to appreciate it better. The jazz moods and southern styles suited the film well, but are good to listen to apart from the film and the soundtrack stands well in its own right. A super album."
5,"Good, no evil here.",I was very pleased with this purchase. The merchandise arrived as indicated in description and transaction was smooth. Highly recommend this seller. Quality stuff!
4,This one grows on you,"The book is really good, the movie mediocre.....but what about the soundtrack?? I would say somewhere in between. Spacey's version of Black Magic is top-notch...a real treat to listen to. Skylark, the album's magical opener, sounds like it is from somewhere else...one of my favorites for sure.However, there are also some downers...Clint is an actor/director but falls short of the singer category. Sorry Mr Eastwood. His daughter does an okay job with her song, but nothing to write home about.So to sum it up, this cd is definitely worth the money, there are just some songs that you will want to skip."
5,Spirit of the South,"The perfect cocktail music. As a southerner, this album brings back many memories of dinner parties laced with cocktails and intelligent conversation. Johnny Mercer captures the sound of the South, and each song is beautifully rendered. Dare I say it... the album is better than the film."
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this cd, it's good listening music and very soothing. My favorites are Skylark/k.d.lang and This Time The Dream's On Me/Alison Krauss. That Old Black Magic/Kevin Spacey was a surprise and entertaining. However, I was disappointed with Alison Eastwood's rendition of Come Rain or Come Shine - I didn't like it in the movie either. I wince every time I hear Ac-cent-tchu-ate The Positive/Clint Eastwood and skip that song.Of mention are pianists Brad Mehldau and Alan Broadbent who accompany on some of the tracks. They are incredible, as are all the other musicians but these two stood out to me. I looked up their cds.I also liked the variety of artists."
4,The Garden is very good,"I really enjoyed each and every song on this excellent sound track. I've read reviews that panned Clint and his daughter, but I found their versions to be as well done as some of the more notable stars featured on the the CD. Recommend both the movie and the sound track"
4,Great CD (but 2 thumbs down on Clint Eastwood),"I really love jazz. I enjoyed seeing the movie ""Midnight"", as far as the CD goes- it's good, all except for Clint Eastwood's version of 'Ac-cent-tchu-ate The Positive'. Overall a great tribute to Johnny Mercer- ""Savannah's Own""."
4,Very enjoyable music,I heard Skylark on the radio recently and remembered that I had heard in in this film. Ordered the CD and I am really enjoying the music. Clint Eastwood has a great ear for putting music in his films.
5,One of the best,"This is one of the best CD's I've purchased in a long time. Every song is wonderful (didn't know Clint could sing). Truly excellent, would like more CD;s just like it. My favorite song is Kevin singing That Old Black Magic....very sexy."
2,Old Fan Disappointed,"We loved every second of the original ""Russian Gypsy"" LP, and had high hopes for this one.Can't argue with the content, but the fidelity was a huge disappointment. Practically no basses at all! Where did they go? No fun at all to listen to. Would try to return it, but not worth the bother.This is not a good legacy for Bikel, a truly great performer."
3,"Hard drive ok, but come with cables","This hard drive was in good conition, but the item reach without cables, I had to buy cable to install device."
4,mother's dream come true,I love this bag. It's a mother's dream come true in keeping the diaper bag organized. It has so many compartments that are labeled so I can't lose my keys or phone. I can always find what I need. The only thing I do not like about the bag is that when I have a water bottle in the bag it tends to be a little on the heavy side. But other than that I recommend this bag to all of my friends.
3,ZIPPER BROKE THE NIGHT I GOT IT!!,"I LOVE THE WAY THE BAG LOOKS AND ALL THE STORAGE IT PROVIDES WITH EVERYTHING NEATLY LABLED BUT THE DARN ZIPPER BROKE THE NIGHT I RECIEVED IT IN THE MAIL. I UNZIPPED IT TO LOOK INSIDE AND WHEN I WENT TO ZIP IT BACK THE TEETH WOULDNT STAY TOGATHER. I LOOKED INTO TAKING IT TO HAVE THE ZIPPER REPLACED BUT YOU HAVE TO FIND A SHOP THAT CAN SEW THROUGH LEATHER AND IN MY SMALL TOWN THAT DOESNT COME EASY. AFTER WAITING FOR MONTHS FOR THE BAG TO BECOME AVAILABLE AGAIN, IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN. I HAVENT TRIED TO RETURN IT BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO MESS WITH SHIPPING IT BACK OUT AND WAITING FOR IT AGAIN."
5,Little Language,"Some parents worry if a child is slow to show language recognition or skills. These books and the music teach how to encourage your baby to make early sounds, even before words are expected. The concept she describes is easy to learn and will give any baby a fast track to language skills. Alan Caruba, Bookviews.com"
5,Parent's Guide Review,"""Mark and Laura Dyer have come up with a 20 song collection of speech enhancing musical selections for infants and toddlers. This is a great way for moms, dads, and kids to have some good quality time for learning and having fun. Laura Dyer, a speech-language pathologist with a master's degree in communication disorders, provides a helpful guidebook on how to utilize each song as an educational device. The book also offers helpful hints and answers to the questions many parents may have about their child's speech and language development...Reviewed by Katie Hoffmaster..."
2,Jennifer Smith,"The songs are wonderfully written, but the vocalist is terrible. Her shrill, whiney voice ruins the songs and makes it very difficult to understand what she's saying - which is the whole point of the CD! i would not recommend this - sorry!"
1,Painful,"I listen to a lot of children's music, but this is painful to hear. There is a reason I didn't record my own CD, I want to hear a nice voice."
1,Terrible,"I purchased this CD for my 21 month old son to help with his language development. From the good reviews above, the lyrics are supposed to be great (and they probably are) but I find them very hard to decipher due to the main female vocalist's singing. She is out of tune and does not annunciate properly. This CD is hard to take. I only gave it one star because I like when the children sing...you can actually tell what they are saying."
1,Bad Vocalist,"Wow is this CD bad. I bought this for my 20 month old son to listen to and sing with... and we both don't like it. The songs are not too bad, but the main female vocalist is horrible. Like one reviewer said her voice is shrill and annoying. Really not worth the $7."
1,Skip it,"They don't make them like they used to. Frankly this is a total waste of money and materials - my last one hung around for years and this one bent on the first use.Get a heavy duty scoop - I don't like plastic and prefer no coatings on handles, but anything would be better than this."
3,Doesn't stand up to Yesterday's News litter.,I bought this metal scoop hoping it would do a better job than the plastic scoop I had. The scoop actually bent when I was cleaning out the litter box one day. I scoop twice a day and was surprised when this metal scoop bent. I can still use it but won't be purchasing another one like this.
4,still my favorite,"metal is slightly lighter gauge than it was 5 years ago but still best combination of scoop shape, size and slit for me and the 4 cats."
5,Hard to find,"I love these metal scoops and they are hard to find in my local pet stores, so I bought them here. Love 'em and will order more when the need arises."
2,Not durable any more,"I used to swear by these scoops. They had the right shape and were thin enough that you could be in and out of the cat box in no time. I'd tried ones that were made from thicker steel and different shapes but they all had problems (too flat, handles not strong enough). This one did the job great.Thing is recently these scoops have been falling apart on my in no time. The joint connecting the scoop to the handle has been breaking (there are two connections and one's been breaking). And, the scoop itself has been bending after maybe a couple weeks of use (I've got a couple of cats so I'm doing these boxes every other day).It's hit or miss. The current scoop I'm using is working so far but it's getting close to that two week mark so we'll see. The price isn't bad at all but definitely buy one first and try it out before you decide fully."
3,Not quite what I was looking for...,"Fighting the litter box every morning, trying to get all the pee blobs out of the box pushed me to purchase a metal scoop, hoping that the metal would more easily disengage the pee blob form the side of the plastic box (my one cat INSISTS on peeing in the corner, for maximum adhesion to the plastic side!). The metal part is dandy, but the handle is just too small. Or maybe my hands are too big. Either way, I generally just suffer with the plastic scoop with the larger, more comfortable handle."
2,Contemporary cello pieces,I bought it because it was the only recording of the Rochberg Ricordanza I could find. The rest are very modern pieces that I don't care for.
4,Pretty vase. Has bubbles.,"Really pretty and heavy vase. Has bubbles in the glass -- not so nice, however this is why it's not $100. Good for the price."
5,Recommend this over FSX,"I purchased this after buying FSX and was unable to even install FSX on my computer. I had been using an older version of Flight Simulator so FS2004 was still an upgrade. I am so happy that I went with the 2004 version. First, it was quick and easy to install. I did not have any problems at all. Second, I was able to find lots of add-ins (scenery, airplanes, etc...) to make the experience even better. I have noticed a ton of improvements over earlier version and my 2 year old computer has not problem running the graphics."
1,terrible,"The program gets lost in the tutorials and can't correct itself. If you can't do exactly what the program says to do when the program says to do it, the only way out is to crash the plane and restart the flight. Thus, one is unable to make any progress.It looked so great, too..."
1,It crashed my computer,Sounded like it would be fun but instead destroyed my computer. Also you really need a joystick
5,the best game ever,flightsimulator2004 s da best game ever great graphics man its unbelieveaballits da be st game in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! get it its the best
1,bad game,this game is a horible game. dont but it. There is no action. no fighting or anything. all u do is take off then fly around then land. U cant even crash ur plane.
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,it sucks the graphics r bad and its not fun to fly and do nothing. Now everytime i launch it it crashes. Bad game. DO NOT BUY
1,Is this a joke?,"Is this a joke? I mean really, this game sucks! The newer versions are way better, but it is almost like this game is a century behind, not a decade. You can't steer with the key board very well, and the videos that teach you how to fly don't work. The biggest waste of $9.99 in my life."
3,Flight simulator,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of FlightTrying to fly a flight from point A to point B I find it difficult to change radio navigation frequencies with no radio panels available. Try to use pause command and then shift 2 to get the radio panels with no successful results. The pitch trim{up or down)does not work like the real world. Must continue to hold up or down elevator force. I had Flight Simulator 98 before and I fill it was more user friendly.
3,Crashes,"Product installed out of the box crashes and after initial run of Flying Lessons, closes program each time Flying Lessons is selected.Working with tech support provided a 3 step process to each time Flight Simulator is loaded. A Selective Startup IPL is required to run to eliminate ALL background programs. After running the game, a Normal Startup restart is required to return the computer to normal operation.Microsoft should include these instructions up front in the installation instructions instead of leaving it to each purchaser to discover the system environment required to run the program. Once beyond this, great scenery, wide range of aircraft, and complete flying lessons as well as ground training on theory of flying."
5,Flight Sim in the Southern Caribbean,I am a FS 98 owner. Upgrading to 2004 was absolutely fantastic. I flew from Trinidad through the caribbean. Absolutely spectacular!!!Paul TaylorTrinidad.
4,A Really Great Simulator,"This is a great FS and a good alternative to FSX, especially to guys like me with a basic home computer running average memory and graphics. I had a little trouble in the beginning using the training portion. The program kept closing, but I reported the error to Microsoft and it hasn't happened since. A word to the wise, buy a quality joystick, not easy to modulate the controls via the keyboard."
3,The game lacks some realism,"Maybe I was too excited from all the hype, but I'm not too crazy about this game. The graphics seem like the games I played in the late 90's. Maybe it's the video card, I don't know. Besides that, you can take a Boeing 747 from 10,000 feet nose down into the ground and the plane will bounce like a dolphin at Seaworld. It would be nice if you clip a tree, you feel it. Instead, you go right through buildings and trees unscathed. I realize this game is not for crashing, but even in real life, there is such a thing as emergency or crash landings. Where is the risk of coming in for a landing too fast, if your just going to bounce like a tennis ball?"
3,Looks great but...,Wow -- MS Flight Simulator sure has come a long way from the original versions -- the price was right and it looks great but... I feel a bit like I've acquired a really beautiful airplane for a steal of a price and I unlock the door and climb in only to find that -- there's no yoke! Being a laptop user I wish I would have known that a joystick was 'required' to have any sense of an intuitive flying experience. IMHO the price should have been higher and a joystick should have been bundled with the software. Unfortunately at this point I've got a great lookin' plane that I can't get off the runway.
1,Disk 4 does not work,"After receiving the product disk 4 will not work, hence I cannot get the game to load. Total waste of money. all it does is make a grinding sound and keeps telling me to put the disk in. Will never buy again or any other software from amazon."
1,didn't work,"well first of all, i never got any status on whether it had been shipped, arrived, etc. but when it came (delivery time wasn't bad), i went to instal it and i have ideal system requirements for this game, but when i went to instal it, it said there was an error, either w/ ram or a corrupt data file. i had enough ram, so i guess it was a corrupt file. i stayed up for 4 hrs and i couldn't get past 20%. if you can, just by fsx, or if you are a serous pilot get x-plane for mac. otherwise, i wouldn't recommend this to a friend."
5,the coolest game on earth,i love flying and i want to be a pilot when i graduate. so i bought this game at my local walmart for $[...] it is the best game ever. it has flying lesons right in the game and u can fly any thing from a boing 777-400to the write brothers origanal 1903 flyer. its a must for any one that likes flying.i would also recomend the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick. i found it works best for this game.Hope u have as much fun with this sim as i didInjoy!
3,FS2004,"FS2004 is ok but the graphics are bad.WHEN YOU HIT THE SEA, THE PLANE JUST JUMPS UP. The plane does not catch on fire or blow up when you hit the runway to hard it just bounces up a little."
3,good graphics limited options,"I was somewhat disappointed after having used Flight Sim 2000 and then upgrading to 2004. The graphics are better and the upgrades are good but the options for aircraft are too limited for what I expected. Mooney Bravo is the only light single retract. There are lots of speicality and unique aircraft but just too few ""general aviation"" types."
5,"Great game, better than FSX.","FS2004 is a great game that will be around a long time. When purchased, the item was shipped promptly and the transaction was smooth."
4,FS2004,"The graphics in FS2004 are vastly superior to those in my older, FS2000. Yet, they don't overwhelm my 2-year old WindowsXP machine, as FSX is rumored to do. Very nice, and customizable."
4,Why are you waiting to buy?,"This game is absolutely terrific. MANY classic planes (Dc-3, Wright Flyer, Spirit of St Louis, plus more) as well as ones you might see every day like the famous Boeing 747 jumbo jet. If you are a terrible flyer (like me) try downloading a crash package to make your crashes look better. If not, you can download more jets from the A380 to Concorde, and even the Space Shuttle. But you'll be just fine with the aircraft that come with the game. However, buy a joystick (I reccomend the Logitech Extreme3DPro) for easy flying. Buy ""Wright"" away! :)"
4,"Great Game, Ok Version","Well it's clear that they have lowered the price of the game because the imporvements over 2002 are small. However, the weather and ATC imporvments are GREAT!! Much better than 2002. The historical planes are semi-cool but who really wants to flyu a wright bros plane that goes 20 mph?? The planes are a bit disapointing because there is no reason they can't put a larger variety of jets on there. And where is the Concorde?At $52.50 it is a bad buy, at the new price $29.00 it is a must have."
2,unsure of cause,"I have F/S 2000 installed and it works beautifully. When I upgraded to F/S 2004 I noticed the smoothness of 2002 was not there. On take off the aircraft lurches down the runway insead of rolling smoothly. Turns are jerky and over controlled making it very difficlult to make approach corrections smoothly and not over correct. I don't understand why this happens other than 2004 requires the #4 disk to be in the CDrom drive all the time, where 2002 does not. It plays with the installed components only. If anyone can offer an explaination or instruction I would appreciate an email at theozmanThanks"
2,not so great,"I wanted to be able to dog fight WW11 aircraft. The aircraft are great... but there is no dog fight function unless you join an online game. So, I'm out."
3,X-Plane's Better,"You buy this to waste money!!!!!Buy X-Plane at X-Plane.com for the same price.Get upgradees for FREE, 100's of free add ons.It comes with 40 aircraft and scenery for the whole world.You can download hundreds of free aircraft from the internet.You can even download a plugin wich alows you to fly with REAL GLOBAL AIR TRAFFIC.Do not buy MSFS 2004, get X-Plane. The latest version is 7.41."
1,Why does this product have a trouble shooting website?,"Have not been able to play this game. Splash screen comes up and then the program tanks. It is looking for Verdana fonts. Why doesn't it come with Verdana fonts. Sounds like the old GM automaker, ""Just get the product out and let the Support people fix it. Or let them try to solve it on the trouble shooting website. Hey, how about waiting for the updates."" Sound like Ford also."
5,Get it if you are a pilot or aspiring pilot!,"As an aspiring pilot I find Flight Simulator 2004 to be a great way to chill out after a hard day at work. The scenery is incredible, and it's hard to beat the realism. This isn't really a game, so if you're thinking about getting Flight Simulator 2004 and trying to beat the top score or save the princess, forget it. Sure, there is a learning curve just as there is with flying a real plane, but it's worth it if you're at all interested in flying. Tip - start with the Lear Jet, it is one of the easier planes to get the hang of. When you get tired of the planes and scenery that come with the simulator you can pick up more at sites like fs2004.com and avsim.com. All in all this ""game"" is highly worth the time and money if you're into flying, or would like to get into flying!"
4,fs2004,"i got fs2004 for my birthday.i like fs2004 because it makes you feel like your really flying..unlike fs98.this simulator is very realistic.it has a variety of aircraft like the Boeing 747,Cessna 172,and old aircraft like the Wright flier,Amelia Earhart's Vega,and the dc-3. the atc is very realistic compared to fs98. during ifr's and vfr's you can change your altitude and can cancel your flight plan unlike fs2002.the flying lessons are fun and easy to understand."
5,best flight sim,Ive been looking at a lot and this tranes you to fly and most of all it runs on win 7 thanks
2,Just ok,"It's not how I remener t being. I played 4-5 years ago when I was In high school and wanted to be a pilot. I loved it, the graphics were great and it had. Nice plane selection. I ended up not going to flight school and took some years off of fs2004. When I started playing again it just wasn't the same. The graphics that I thought were great back then were mediocre. I found my self getting bored on it. I think it's a good beginners game. But if you want something with superior graphics, plane selection and more, this isn't it."
3,Good enough,"Bought this product as I like all flight sims. It is good. I look forward to MS coming out with another MS Flight Simulator with aircrafts like the Baron 58 and ATR-42, and a few other prop aircrafts.Something totally different, aircraft wise.This package lives up to expectations and the improvements over the previous MS Flight Sims is huge. Really enjoyed flying the Baron 58 aircraft as I used to own one previously."
4,I bought it as a gift,The only report i got from the friend who is very much into flying was this was a good sim and he loved it. Sorry I couldn't give more info but he did say that it plays better with a good gamer type joystick.
1,zero,This is my first flight simulator tape and it is all over the place not easy to start to use so I think I will try something different not easy to start
5,MS Flight Simulator 2004,The real experience of actually flying...in a software.The only drawback I had was that there were no instructions/booklet in the box.
3,It's all right!,"You could learn to pilot the planes, just wished the gorund textures were better and had more seletion of planes and the helicopter tutor is not so good"
4,old stuff,"Overall I would say it's a good game, but I was disappointed to find out there was FSX which I should have bought instead of this FS 2004. It was presented as the first FS game to me in my search, and I just clicked add to cart in excitement, cos I hadn't played a flight Sim game for over 10yrs. I owned the 1st flight sim donkey years ago, so when I read the review on this one it excited me. I started playing it with excitment and interest till I found out about FSX and read it's reviews. However, FS 2004 impressed me in the almost real details and facts embedded in the training school section especially. I enjoyed it while it lasted (that was before FSX punched a hole and let out all the hot air). I'm restraining myself from spending further on FSX. I only just resumed trying to play games, as I am an extremely busy man. We'll see how it goes."
5,The gold standard,"If you're a veteran you know, if you're new to Flight Sim rest assured this is the most comprehensive flight learning game/tool available. Just make sure you have a computer that can handle the game. Take the hardware requirements seriously."
4,Great flying sim overall!,"If you like reality when it comes to flying buy this game. The weather effects are great! From T-storms to blinding snow to clear blue skys. You can even download real-time weather off the internet weather sites for any start location! The clouds look real not like artificial white graphics in past FS's but real and when you fly through them it you feels as if your just floating up there like the real thing. There is of course no combat in this sim but just learning how to keep a Leer Jet steady against a strong prevailing wind is a challege! My favorite feature is being able to set your fly time, location, weather type and even game speed. I have recently read another review where one guy said the ground textures are not so hot but if you zoom in using the ""+"" you can see the textures much clearer and the cloads! In all I think flight sims have come along way since the 90's and with each new release like this one it gets more relatisic!"
3,Think twice!,"While the game is very detailed and realistic, the controls are VERY difficult for even an FPS-RTS player like myself to try. For example, when you press the left arrow key to turn left no matter how sensitively you press right or left again you can NEVER fly at level or straight again, there's little excitement in it, and the constant roar of the engine is an atrocious assault on your senses. If you think this game is like soaring through the great blue sky as free as a bird you are sadly mistaken. Even on the highest graphics settings, you're still just flying over a basically pixellated landscape with little variety. All the realism that goes into the physics and the controls and the geographical accuracy cannot make up for the fact that for a lot of people, this game will simply not be fun."
3,Fun at first,"At first glance, this game looks and is really fun. But after so long of playing it, it really gets a little boring. Sure the features and graphics are really nice, but the game starts to seem a bit pointless when you fly your mission (which can be hours long), and absolutely nothing happens when you finish! You take off, fly, land, and hit escape to end the mission. There is no reward for the efforts of playing this game, and gets boring somewhat quickly."
2,20 years later...,"I used the first Flight Simulator back in the days of MSDOS. I expected the graphics to have been improved since then. No doubt the graphics are better but all things being equal, time has not helped as much as one would expect. I would buy an older version and wait another 20 years before I bought the latest version."
4,FS 2004 Review,"Hard to believe I have been flying with this program for 8 years. It is so realistic, even has skid marks on the runways, you can use curent weather conditions. There are so many variables you can set, weather, clear all the way to thunderstorms, engine failure, instrument failure, equipment failure. The details at the airports are wonderful, taxiway lines, gates numbered, great terrain detail, love to fly in the mountains.Indian Maiden w/ Wolves Framed Indian PictureFramed Indian BRAVES Picture Native American Art 9 x 11 (including frame) ReproductionFramed Indian Picture - HorsesFramed Indian WOLVES Picture Native American Art 9 x 11 (including frame) WOLF Reproduction"
4,Worthy software,Completely uncommon to my experience with Micro$oft products this works and is informative. I am actually learning something and enjoying myself while I do it.
5,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004:A Centruy of Flight,Flight Simulator - very realistic - pilot for 30 +++ yr. lost ticket due to health - so this is how I fly. Pull out the old Jeppessen charts and letter rip.
4,FS2004,As a user of FSX this product seems to be extreamly close to the same with different aircraft. Overall same simulator (not FAA cert.) but overall a good product if this is your type of thing
2,Old Title,This is an older version of Microsoft's flight simulator. I bought it so I could make panels that would be compatible with both FS 2004 (also known as FS9) and FSX (also known as FS10) otherwise I would not have bought it at all as the newer FSX version is totally better.
1,It broke! Poorly made and designed.,"Not a dependable product! Broke after a few times used. Cheaply made, would not buy another. Go to the dollar store and buy one there, you would make out better."
3,Not worth an arm and a leg,"Although these are comfortable and do give more support than most underwear, I can't see how on earth they are worth $30 for ONE. The only thing that might justify the price is if they last many years without any deterioration. I'll sure be interested to see..."
1,Hide and Sleek? I think not,"With all the rave reviews I've heard about the Spanx products, I thought the panty was a weak product. They're ugly, don't breathe well, and didn't look to help the little belly pooch I was looking to hide."
4,Support for my Mummy Tummy,"After my 4th child was born my tummy lost any sense of control and no amount of ab-crunches and fat-reducing cardio is making a difference in my lower abdomin. My favorite VS panties weren't cutting it and I knew I needed something new. After trying other VS, Maidenform, Jockey, and private-label brands I decided to invest in two pair of these (on sale, of course). I love them! I like how these panties give my tummy the support it needs and how my clothing (especially that which doesn't have a little spandex) fits more smoothly across the front. The wide cotton gusset is extremely comfortable and I like the lace detail. I also like that I don't have any VPLs - which was a nice suprise as I thought that might happen with a shaping panty. I did't rate them a 5-star because there is a little ride in the back at times (but since I'm moving on from a thong it doesn't bother me so much). Also, I wish Spanx would offer these in more colors (and patterns would be fun, too!)."
4,good equipment,"I gave this gps as a gift but the reciepient loves it. The only disappointing feature was that when getting directions for somewhere it does not tell you to turn left or right or anything like that. It just shows a map from point a to point b. Not a huge big deal but for people like me who cant read a map to save a life, this was a disappointment. Other than that no problems."
2,Junk - Do not buy,Junk - Do not buy. The battery is not nearly as good as the original. Spend the extra money and get an original replacement!
5,Excellent plotting,"This book is a masterpiece of plotting, characterization and good writing. It kept me transfixed. I think it would make a great movie. It also raises some interesting questions about the nature of evil."
3,"Very dry somewhat boring, but good information","This is about roles people play in co-dependant relationships mostly in terms of drug & alcohol addiction. It also goes into roles parents & children play in dysfunctional families.Great information, low production values, but good enough to see & hear, but Jef Gazley seems to teach in a roundabout long way. He has some passion, but barely reflects in his voice. You still really have to pay attention to get the info, it's easy to tune him out. Taught like a basic college psychology class. Considering this is less then an hour, I have no idea why it's above 50 dollars, this should only be 10-15 dollars.You can see previews under his name ""AskTheTherapist"" on youtube & his own site AskTheTherapistYou can also see it immediately at Netflx w/their ""play online"" ability."
3,"+3/4 -- Blend of blues, island and gulf-coast sounds","Taj Mahal's always been more of a roots musician than a dedicated bluesman. His early excursions into reggae (1974's ""Mo' Roots""), and his earlier work with Hawaiian music (1998's ""Sacred Island"") are only a few of the projects that anticipate this release. This time out he's backed by an acoustic string band, with plenty of slack-key guitar, for a gumbo of blues, island sounds and flavors of the gulf coast. What's particularly impressive is how smoothly Mahal and his band blend reggae (""Blackjack David,"" and Bob Marley's ""African Herbsman""), country blues (Mississippi John Hurt's ""My Creole Belle""), and folk-rock (""All Along the Watchtower""). At times they rework the songs to their milieu, but more to the point, Mahal brings all of this music under his own umbrella, exposing their common roots without defoliating their individuality."
1,What a waste,I've played it through three times and am going to junk it.It's [bad] - incredibly repetitive lyrics.Whatever happened to the real Taj Mahal?This is the last time I ever pay any attention to a magazine music reviewer. I would definitely like to have my money back.
4,Delightful!,"When Christmas Comes, is a feel good book. You are drawn into each character. It's not a long book, so you can easily read it in a day. I really enjoyed the characters and the simple plot. An excellent Holiday book."
2,Pretty bland,"This is a harmless enough little holiday yarn, but that is about it. There is almost no description. A display of holiday lights, for example, is described as ""like those in [Emily's] hometown, but different, too,"" which tells us precisely nothing. I didn't really find any of these people very admirable; as characters they were underdeveloped, and sometimes it was hard to remember (or care) who was who. Nobody contemplates anything very deep. Good things happen, but basically by coincidence. Wait and check this one out at the library, if you must."
4,Insightful scholarship,"The painstaking research undertaken by Rachel Bronson is formidable. She remained objective, except for the conclusions drawn at the book's end. There was a point at which everything finally seemed clear. I eagerly await her next endeavor."
5,"Highly readable, meticulously researched, even-handed","Rachel Bronson's book is an exceptional accomplishment. She uses a vast number of authoritative sources and weaves a compelling and readable account of complex geopolitical relationships. Marshall Lilly's recent (August 6, 2006) review is right on target. Thomas G. O'Brien III, Palm Beach Gardens, FL"
3,Videos,I was a bit disappointed when I receive this DVD. The description page on the internet did not have any type of write up or information available. The DVD only had 5 songs and my favorite was not on it. When I viewed the DVD it was music videos instead of a live performance. I was actually looking for live performances. Because there was no description on the page when I purchased I really didn't know what I was purchasing .. I just took a chance.
1,Love Cameo Songs,"There is not one live performance of Cameo, which I thought it was when I purchased the dvd. There are 5 videos, which I have only seen the first one. After that, I didn't want to see anymore of this dvd. It's a waste of money."
2,typical...,"I hate it when romance writers try to write female leads as independent misses when in reality they are really just stubborn. Ms. Johnson's Flora is such a gal. Flora - because she is ""smart and independent"" - disobeys Adam and practically gets him killed! Oh, but she is independent, so it is okay. Sometimes it pays to listen to others; refusing to listen to others really makes one stupid, not independent. Flora was one forward gal for the age the story was written in. I have to agree with another reviewer who pointed out that Adam (our gorgeous hero) and Flora meet and in a few quick dance steps are out the door doing it in a carriage. He would have tipped his hat (if he had one) and said thanks and not really thought that much more about her again. Especially since she made it clear he was not the first. Also, the story should have been a bit shorter - too many issues get in the way."
3,Good,"I liked it but I did not think it was great. I liked the main characters well enough. I could even see how he fell in love with Flora since she seemed to be everything a man could want. Other than being sexy and a good dad I did not see that much to recommend Adam. So much of their relationship seemed to be about sex. Other than being faithful to each other they seemed to lack any sense of right and wrong regarding sex. Plus it is hard for me to equate sex and love when the ""f"" word is being used. It was still a good enough story, but not worth reading again."
3,In lust on the first meeting...,"Independant, headstrong but did she have to go all out on the first meeting!! I don't know why but it justseemed to put me off the character of Flora intially. It is one thing to be strong of character but 'slutty'on the first meeting?? In saying that I did like the attributes of Flora and the clever dialogue between thetwo. Like in all the novels of Susan Johnson, once the hero samples the delights of the heroine they becomealmost sexually obsessed with them and somehow the heroines seem to take on the skills of courtesans allof a sudden. Still if you like your historical romance hot and explicit then Susan Johnson is for you.I did like Adam Serrre and the way he gradually came to believe that yes indeed in amongst all that lust,that love could blossom."
3,3.5 stars,"This book starts off with a BANG! I really liked the H and h in this story. Adam was a great character that you couldn't help but fall in love with. Adam and Flora complimented each other perfectly. This story was really good, but it did drag in some spots (hence the 3.5 stars). Once you get through the slower spots of the story, it really is good."
3,Monotonous,"The ""plot"" of this piece picks up immediately; unfortunately it is a very static plot embellished with a whole lot of [physical] interaction between the two main characters. After reading about them in steamy embrace again and then again, I became bored. ..."
2,PURE BORING..,"I can't believe the rating this book is getting. Personally I don't think the story is thrilling in anyway at all. Not even the sex-scenes. Flora the main character is the least special, I mean c'mon she basically throw herself on the laps of a (supposedly) macho undecissive male's ego. This reason alone is a put-off for a romance story; but there is more... I found the dialog is more like when one asks, the other answer by ASKING! What could be so special about the cynicism of the conversation anyway?? There is all this historical plots which at least quiet informative, so I give it 2 stars just for the research the author was conducting (I especially like the one that mentions about the early potato chips making). Anyway, I like Emma Holly's novels far better than S J."
3,center speaker great ... satellite speakers crap,the center speaker I use for my existing surround system and it is very clear and sounds great ... the other 2 speakers are fairly crappy sounding ... BTW this is NOT maple it is solid black!!
5,Monster Monster Monster,"No, Roger is _not_ my cousin.I play all the saxes, and this guy's a real monster bari player. He's taken the big horn to a whole new level. I am rarely so impressed with jazz recorded since, well, about 1965 or so, but Roger's record blows me away (recorded in 2000). The rhythm section is does a great job of supporting him, and the album is a nice collection of originals and a few standards. Bopper plus extra mas mucho, baby."
4,Nice Introduction for Young Minds,"My nine year old daughter enjoyed the full page pictures in this book and was able to understand the basic concept of the human heart. I'm not sure I would categorize this as a ""children's book"", although the reading level is probably intended for a third or fourth grader. It served as a good reference for our unit study, but I think The Amazing Circulatory System by Slim Goodbody's Body Buddies is a more interesting and engaging book on the heart."
4,good selection from a great artist,"In his deafness, Betthoven believed a human voice could sing as easily as a violin could play. in only two males was he correct--the modern being Josh Groben, the earlier being this man, John McCormack. Even with the limitations of the recording technology of his day, his voice couldn't be limited. The songs on this CD are mostly later recordings, and in one way that's a good thing--sound quality had improved somewhat, and you could get a better idea of his greatness. But there are some songs, not on this album, recorded before 1920, that are simply awe-inspiring. This CD is a great way to start a collection of his great work."
3,A Memorable Year,1993: Greatest Highlights presents a detailed overview of one of NASCAR's more memorable seasons. The video begins with Dale Jarrett's thrilling Daytona 500 victory and culminates in Dale Earnhardt's winning the prestigious Winston Cup. Also covered are the tragic deaths of Alan Kulwicki and Davey Allison. Thorough commentary keeps you up to date as you watch a brief recap of every race. A fitting review of a memorable year.
2,Don't bother seeing,"I was expecting alot more from National Geographic on this one. I was let down. I wanted a thought provoking, well made, captivating doc on the War in Iraq to show my class but this is not that film. Go with Frontline's Bush's War."
4,Beautiful bowl but much smaller than I thought it was going to be!,"I ordered this small bowl. It arrived but was much much much smaller than I thought it would be. I still like it and will use it somehow, but not as I anticipated!"
4,Very interesting topic,"This book is very helpful in determining how the US Media portrays terrorist activities and the countries those terrorists represent. A very helpful book for those studying racisim towards ""terrorist nations"" and how the USA (esepcially the media) views them and how that view effects the USA population."
3,Good reference for beginner,"ok, ok.. I was expecting something more along the lines of traditional tarot help books. This was a bit of a surprise, and a pleasant one at that. While I feel that someone a little farther along in their Tarot journey might find this a bit ""water-downed"", from where I sit, this was a good step away from typical interpretation. I appreciate the reference to other esoteric teachings as well as the symbology discussed in this book. This book would be great for a beginner in combination with a book that discusses the meanings of the cards in the various positions. Although Ms. Porter does begin the book with a brief touch on the traditional meanings of the cards, she does not go in depth enough to make this an all-inclusive book."
1,Worst experience ever,"The one piece sink vanity top I ordered from Amazon arrived in pieces because it was not well packed. I immediately notified the seller who said they had to have a picture before they could replace it. I sent a picture the next day which they acknowldged. I waited 10 days for a replacement and contacted the seller again when I didn't get one. Since then I have contacted them numerous times and after 6 weeks was told I had been sent a refund. I still have no sink, no refund, no credit to my account. I've never had an experience like this with anything I've bought online. I don't know what to do at this point."
3,Very Downtempo and Funky,"This CD lacked energy and put me asleep. It had a funky vibe that some may like, but it was not for me. I would not recommend this CD."
1,Hed Kandi is dead,"The Hed Kandi label used to be the hottest stuff you could find. Always the lastest sounds with amazing beats. Unfortunately, they hit their peak in 2003 and now they have sunk pretty low.Don't waste your money on this. The high prices extorted by this label isn't worth the music offered much less the graphic design."
2,it is just ok,"compared with the first book, this one is much less interesting or useful. The examples about the polygonal meshes, nurbs, and subdivision surfaces look useful at the beginning, but they are just so similar to each other and finally turned out to be boring and a waste of time. Lots of mathematical errors, especially in the part of matrices, transformations. So I guess I will recommend the first book than this one."
5,HOT JAZZ,""" 'Peter's Diner' is a slice-of-life story song whose jazzy, breezy vibe(including brushed drums) is easy on the ears. Nash impresses us moston ""Live,"" a hooky blues/country song where the performers velvetyvocal is dripping with reverb..."" raves Music Connection magizine."
5,Rice Bowls,"Great product, and a great seller. This bowl is an interesting size when compared with others in the series, big enough and deep enough for cereal, fruit, and soup. I definitely recommend it."
5,This series is haunting.,I read this series in the eighties. Since then we lost the books in the attic. I have been haunted with thoughts of these books for years. We found the books recently and I'm looking forward to reading them again.
5,Better than the scariest ride!,"This series of books is just like a can of pringles; once you pop you can't stop, and I mean that literally. I began the series at the same time as my best friend. She would call me nightly to complain that I had given her insomnia. She couldn't put the books down. Me neither. I read one through four in two days. I finished five and six within the next three days ( had to work you know). I would recommend these books to everyone. They will scare you, thrill you, and throw you a few curve balls; I guarantee you will be thuroughly entertained with this series."
2,Reprise reprise reprise,"I too purchased this in hopes that it would match ""Sebastapol"" or at least ""Straightaways"". At first it appears that way until you get to his ""instrumentals"". They are indeed not suitable for release. This album could have definitely used an editor. And it's really starting to get to the point where if you've heard one Jay Farrar song, you've heard them all. In my mind he did better on the one song he wrote (""Gather"") for THE SLAUGHTER RULE than he did for this entire record. I suppose it should be listened to at least once though, eh?"
2,Disappointing.,"I've given this album numerous spins, but try as I may, I can not force myself to like it. This album is extremely low-key. Lethargic would be the one word I would have to use to describe it. Most tracks feature only Jay and his guitar, with some sparse studio effects throw in. There is a distinct lack of percussion on the album. Even the songwriting seems subpar. Much of it seems to be Jay just strumming on his guitar. It's hard to believe this is the same person who wrote Graveyard Shift, Drown, or even Voodo Candle. It's extremely disappointing considering that Sebastopol and even ThirdShiftGrottoSlack were fine releases. In fact, it's a damn shame."
2,why the 30 second feedback garbage and repeated tracks??,"There are a couple of decent tracks here but on a better album, they'd be skips. What kills this album, aside from the lack of hooks, melody and beat in most cases, is the repeated tracks that are exactly the same as the previous version save for some added reverb or delay. And those annoying feedback things like 'space jam' that are immediate skips and serve no purpose whatsoever. Farrar continues his downward slide. Hes hit rock bottom and I believe the only way he can recover is to actually find a band again."
2,TEW WERDS,I've got two words for this album - BO-RING!!!!!Space Junk? The whole album is junk. Thankyou.
1,Terrible,"All I can say is this record is bad. Jay projects absolutely no feeling behind his vocals. Where is the power? The record is lazy and uninviting without hooks or melody. Dear Jay, get a rock band! Play Rock Music."
4,Stop with the Jeff vs. Jay B.S.,"Grow up, stop comparing, and start listening. This is a very moving, rewarding album. And I echo the reviewer who emphasized that songs are not repeated, they are reinterpreted.As for the Space Junk, this kind of composition is venerable by now, hardly experimental. Varèse was composing in the 1920s (um, like, that's almost a century ago), Stockhausen and John Cage in the '40s and '50s. Complaining about it now is like complaining about modern art. Illiterate."
5,Record of the Year????? Maybe!!,"Jay Farrar takes a quantum lead ahead of Son Volt and Wilco with this release. From the noodlings of ""Space Junk"" I-V to the heartbreaking ""Heart on the Ground"" it's Farrar at his best and most daring. Experimental???? Yes. It took a few listens to get into it, but it's well worth the second or sometimes third effort."
3,space funk,"Somewhere in this overlong, padded cd there is a promising kernel of music. Remove all the space junk, that awful song ""California,"" and about 5 or 6 others, slap a 7.99 price tag on it, and you probably have a 5 star EP to hawk to the alt-country masses."
3,won't be making any new friends with this one,"I'll echo the sentiments of previous reviewers when i say that, for fans, this is fine. But this is certainly not the album that earns him any universal acclaim (reviews have been markedly mediocre for this release.) It's very low-key, very far away from any rockin' stompers of days past. The ""space junk"" seems to rub many the wrong way, but it is part of the art as a whole, so i don't mind. The versions, while not unique in music, are unique to this artist and this genre, so kudos for trying something outside the box. And that's really the key: this album succeeds/fails on its own terms. Not by any alt-country standards or even by Farrar's own standards set with UT, SV, or his previous solo work. This is purely its own animal, and it's close enough to typical Farrar that it angers some. Hard to believe he didn't fully expect it that way."
4,Good Start,"Dr. Conze has collected a large number of short versions of the Prajnaparamita texts. They are informative and valuable especially regarding what Buddhists refer to as Emptiness. Indeed, the Tibetan Buddhists in addition to various Vajrayana texts, often cite and recommend the Prajnaparamita literature which is vast. This literature includes the famous Heart Sutra (which is actually about one page long!). I gave this particular book 4 stars because I've also read the intermediate length version (8000 lines) which is far better. I own (but haven't read yet) the large version (I think its 25,000 lines). There are even larger ones that Dr. Conze hasn't done too. Nevertheless, it might be best to read the short ones first to get a taste for the literature and then move on to the 8000 lines version (probably the one most referenced other than, perhaps, the Heart Sutra itself). Good reading!"
5,"McCartney--The ""Roots""","When a musician captures the eccense of what Rock & Roll has meant to so many of us in the last 50 years, it is truly inspirational! Paul McCartney does it here. A must buy for listeners and collectors alike. ....John Robert"
4,Crime buffs should enjoy these shows.,"I like most A&E true-crime shows & this one is no exception. Why 4 instead of 5 stars? Well, I wish that there were more episodes per DVD or that the price were lower. That's my only gripe with them."
4,Good Deal,A grade below weathertech but well worth it (not as thick plastic etc). Fit perfectly in Ford Excursion and saved a ton compared to weathertech. I would buy them again for any other vehicle I own.
5,Very easy picture editing program to use.,Very easy picture editing program to use. I have used Picture It! for years but lost it in a computer crash. There was no question what we were going to replace it with.
4,problem with greeting card text....disappearing after saving,"I don't know why when I create cards and save them for printing later, my text on the inside and back of the cards disappears! I insert the text again, and again and again, only to have it delete after I save it. What is happening? Very frustrating to say the least."
5,AWESOME!,"This book has a thrill a minute - and proves that ordinary kids aren't necessarily so ordinary after all! I would recommend this book for anyone who loves dragons and magic, it reminded me a bit of a cross between harry potter and dragonriders of pern."
3,half the run time that is claimed and horrible audio,"the video is ok i guess, i'd think something priced at 14 bucks would be better.. the future runtime is only 23 minutes not the 40 that they claim.the audio is horrible it's hollow and muffled and hard to understand. its like someone recorded there voice on a laptop and a mic they bought from walmart for 9 bucks.if the animation was the work of some highschool grade kids, then its a decent start, if its from an adult, i'm sorry but the quality is very sub par. not even up to the low standards of saturday cartoons."
1,Blech!,"Enya is such a load of pop drivel. Anyone who can stand to listen to this doesn't know what good music is. There's no heart, all the instruments are synthesized and its basically a more boring form of techno, I don't see how this qualifies as celt music at all, I guess because there's a ""tree"" or ""star"" thrown in every now and then. BLECH!"
2,A serious artist?,"There was no need for Enya to release a greatest hits package so soon. She had two magical efforts with ""Watermark"" and ""Shepard Moons."" I thought ""Memory of Trees"" was disappointing, and ""The Celts"" is really just a complilation of earlier works. This CD contains her classics, but that's only about half the tracks on this CD. The rest seem to be fillers. There are two new tracks, so fans have to buy this one! It's hard to know if Enya or the record company wanted a greatest hits CD at this time. To me, it appears that Enya is going after the money. That wonderful talent behind ""Watermark"" & ""Shepard Moons"" seems tarnished. Is she still a 'serious' artist? I have doubts now."
4,Terrific Complication of Hits and Favorites,"Ironically enough, the title track is rather depressing. But everything else is superb, with standard hits like ""Orinoco Flow"", ""Caribbean Blue"", and ""Anywhere Is"", plus lesser-known treasures. Of course, everything couldn't be included, so personal favorites from other CD's might be missing, but that's no problem if like a true Enya fan, you've got them all already. :)"
5,I buy EVERYTHING THAT GENIE and ENYA make,"Lovely best-of collection. You don't really need it if you have the other CD's, but it's nice to have. There's a bonus track.Enya is one of those rare artists that I just buy everything she makes.I also buy everything made by this obscure Amish artist named GENIE makes. It's very much like enya but there are no electronic instruments on the newer CD's bby Genie. I like the stuff that Genie and ENya do that's pure and natural, no artificial anything."
3,ENYA IS A MEMORABLE ARTIST,"Enya's music is captivating, and we have had this CD for a long time - and enjoyed her musice even longer!"
5,Passionate and poetic.........,"and that was only the reviews. But then, so is Enya. I was again charmed and delighted by this new (to me) CD.I would strongly suggest this CD for anyone who has to spend any time at all in traffic. The music is so delightful, and fun, it simply takes me away. Some of the reviewers are so eloquent in their descriptions of the music, but they are so accurate. It floats, it laughs, it becomes serious, it skips lightly and takes you along with it. Makes you want to ""dance like no one's looking""....I think it leaves me ready to smile, and when is that ever a bad thing!"
5,Wonderful!,"This was my first ever Enya album, and it got me hooked. I'm not a real fan of the new-age genre, but she's wonderful. While some may say that her type of musicis enough to knock a person into blissful dreamland, it all depends on what you like. Personally, the tones are ultimately peaceful and relaxing,though nowhere near making me want to go to bed. Looking for a way to unwind? Or how about some gentle background music when inviting guests over for dinner?And, unless you and your loved one are heavily in metal or rap, this would be perfect for a romantic night alone. Kick back, relax.. it's sheer ear-candy."
4,"Mood Music, some good, some bad","Enya's music is spacey with airy singing. Much of it is genuinely moving and touches emotions, but other tunes make the listener almost want to die. Definitely mood music. Good songs:Orinoco FlowCarribean Blue - very etherealBook of DaysCeltsAnywhere IsOnly IfThe CeltsPaint the Sky with Stars - not a good song. I mention it as illustrative of my above comment. This is a real downer. Don't listen to it if you are struggling with suicidal thoughts in your life. I'm not just making a bad joke with this comment; it is truly mournful.Overall the first half is more enjoyable. Album could have 5 stars if it had maintained that pace, but the 2nd half is much more depressing rather than emotive"
4,Most of her best.,"It's always hard to say what is and isn't an artists best, but there's no doubt that this is most of it, even if it's missing a few good ones. It's also pretty lengthy at 16 tracks. Included is ""Caribbean Blue"", ""Storms In Africa"", ""China Roses"", and the hugely popular ""Orinoco Flow"", among many other favorites. Even the songs I didn't know before, I now love as much as the others. I only wish this included material from her last album, which was released after this was. Anyway, even though I also listen to metal and rap, I believe ""Enya"" is a must for any collection. Her music is simply beautiful."
5,magical,I love Enyas work it is very magical music! If you like her then you might want to check out up-and coming artist Tia Knight as well.lots of talent here.
3,Didn't have enough of my favorites,"I was hoping for something really enjoyable to listen to in the car and easier to carry around. Upon listening to the CD, I would recommend buying her individual CDs instead of this compilation. I found the choices of the titles included to be unsatisfying for me to listen to and I will probably end up giving the CD away. If this was my first exposure to Enya, I don't think I would have bought more CDs."
3,Maybe I Listened to it too Long,"We bought this CD in order ot get ""Orinoco Flow"". We also knew that Enya did two tracks for The Lord of the Rings. That's about all we knew. We also bought A Day Without Rain at the same time, so it's hard to keep them apart. I always seem to hear a selection from one of these CD's playing as background almost everywhere I go.I find this to be a surprisingly good technical production since when I listened to most of the newer pieces on her web site they were very muddled and distorted. Clean overtones, solid and deep bass, with crispness and clarity throughout. I have read about the ""sameness"" of her recordings, but did not find this to be my own opinion. There is the ""Enya"" sound, but there is a difference.However, we listened to the CDs so much I got burned out. My wife didn't, and is continully loaning one or the other to someone who hears her playing it in the car."
5,Truely the best of Enya,"I love Enya! and have loved this cd ever since i was little. It is so beautiful and every song is great. It does have one flaw though, my fav Only Time (a day without rain)is not on it! i think it is an Enya classic and should be one of her bests. All of the songs are amazing. The memory of trees and watermark are the most beautiful songs on the album. It is also a good cd to listen to when you are meditating or in nature--it helps you relax. I own a day without rain and the memory of trees albums and i love all of them, but this album is truely the best out there!"
3,enya,"My friend really wanted the song ""book of days"" for our ballet recital peice, so i have been listenin to this cd looking at the songs. I definitaly think this is a good cd, but different from what im used to. Enya is a very goosd artist and i like this cd very much.-amanda 11, pa"
3,She Peaked Before This CD,"I kept 11 of these 16 songs, most of which I had previously heard on a couple of her earlier CDs. I heard little new here that I liked well; there seems to be an almost mechanical repetitiveness in her work that is not adequately compensated by her ethereal voice, even with the use of echo chambers."
4,Her Best,"Fans of Enya will enjoy this collection of her ""best"" work even if it doesn't contain their favorite songs. Enya's ethereal vocals combine with bizarre synthesized sounds to create a listening experience that is very pleasureable and relaxing. This CD would serve as a good introduction for those interested in hearing some of Enya's work. Personally, my favorite song wasn't there, but I found that the songs included were good enough to make up for that.To reiterate, I highly recommend this CD to both veteran fans and newcomers alike as a relatively varied sample of Enya's Celtic-inspired music."
5,One of the best,"When I need to relax, Enya helps fill the void and this definitely is the best of her best. There is not much that you can't do to Enya's music; work, draw, meditate and just plain relax. Along with Medhi, Digital Moodz, Amethystium and Enigma, I have quite the collection to ""mello"" to."
4,"Most of her best, but not all","There is a difference between 'best' and 'greatest hits', in my opinion. No doubt Enya's music is as soul-stirring to everyone else as it is to me, so I feel the need to defend some of Enya's less well-known songs.On this collection, there are too many airy-choir songs (anywhere is, only if, china roses) that don't do a lot for me. Beautiful, of course, but a lttle too trademark. Seemed as if they were catering to what they felt will sell instead of putting her true best on the album.I think her 'best' should have included songs like 'The Longships' and 'Lothlorien'. Not chart-toppers, but excellent pieces of creativity. Her instrumentals are every bit as great as her vocals--original, captivating, inspiring. Still, far as compilation albums go, this is probably the best I've heard. Thoroughly satisfying."
1,Like Listening to a Migraine Headache,"This record, really all of Enya's stuff, is nasty. Although Enya herself seems like a lovely lady her music is the absolute pits. Just think of the words you would use to describe bad music in general - repititive, unimaginative, sterile, undeveloped, lyrically weak, etc. - and what do you have? answer:Enya. Even after listening to just one of Enya's boring and repititive songs I'm ready for 2 Extra Strength Tylenol and a warm bath. To all those who have blindly ascribed 5 star ratings to Enya, all I can say is do yourself a favor and buy some music that will shock you out of your weird and inexplicable cult-like Enya trances. ""Dig Your Own Hole"" by The Chemical Brothers or ""Better Living Through Chemicals"" by FatBoy Slim should do the trick.Peace, I'm out."
2,Overrated,"Her voice is fine, but this stuff just sounds too much like church music. And I don't have to have that in an album collection. I can get the same effect with better results with my classical albums."
1,Paint the Sky with Stars,"I can't say how disappointed I am in this recording. ""Watermark"" is one of my all-time favorites. ""Paint the Sky with Stars"" is called ""The Best of Enya""? How could I lose? I lost. I only wish Amazon allowed the return of CDs. This is SO bad and ""Watermark"" was SO good. How could the same person produce two so different CDs? This sounds so shallow and juvenile compared to the rich depths of ""Watermark."" No wonder Enya hasn't been recording lately..."
1,Really Bad,"I agree with JDuncan@AOL. Enya is boring and repitive. I bought this because a friend heard some of my Trip Hop CD's like Morcheeba and said i should give Enya a try too. Unlike Trip Hoppers Morcheeba, Portishead and Massive Attack, Enya clearly lacks a rich musical background and any edge whatsoever to her music. Take that away and there's really nothing of interest left."
3,"Repetition, repetition, repetition...","I love Enya, don't get me wrong. It just seems that every second album released with her name on it is yet another ""Best of..."" album. Adding a couple new songs to the last compilation, slapping a new name and pretty picture on it and then marketing it as something new just doesn't cut it."
4,Definately Enya,"I really like Enya's voice and finding this CD was good. However only one song, ""Orinoco Flow"" was one that i had heard of Enya. The rest were pretty new to me. I should think that the best of Enya should have incredibly popular songs that almost everyone has heard. It is a good CD, the music is fantastic, but it really isnt like the BEST of Enya."
5,BETTER THAN ANY DRUG,"Perhaps one of the best collections of songs I've ever heard,give it a listen and feel as if you're soaring in the clouds. I first heard Enya on a commercial a couple years ago for Pure Moods (it was Orinoco Flow) Then I heard ""Only If"" in the advertisement for Pure Moods III and loved it,so I purchased this CD. It's fantastic. Every song as a beautiful feel to it especially ""Only If"" and it is the perfect soundtrack to relieve stress after a hard day. This is a CD that ANY age can enjoy and that's rare. Definately worth every penny,this is a must buy for everyone!"
4,Beautiful!,This CD is a great way to introduce yourself to Enya's music if you already haven't. The classic Orinoco Flow still amazes me and Storms In Africa is my favorite Enya song. She has a beautiful voice and this is one of the best CD's I've heard in a long time.
5,Almost perfect,"The songs are cleverly composed, so is the voice of the singer itself. It is a truly remarkable work ..."
5,Enya still rules,"After reading another customer's comments on a Loreena McKennit album in which she called Enya ""artificial"" compared to Loreena, I had to come to Enya's defense. Although I think Loreena is great, Enya was the first of this type music i listened to and i will always be able to go back and listen to this album and remember youth and forget my troubles. Enya is a pioneer in new celtic music and she still has it - no matter waht new artists come out."
3,Pleasant and listenable...if a little repetitve.,For the majority of buyers - Enya fans - this is an enjoyable collections of songs. Certainly this is music you can play while entertaining the guests over dinner with your considered conversation. I prefer her first effort: Watermark. This strikes a chord and contains greater variation. That 'The Best of Enya' has now been released seems to indicate for me that the Enya sound has reached the bottom of the barrel - emphasised by the fact that the collection begins with Orinoco Flow - her signature tune.
5,Just Great,You are about to buy it? Don't think any further... get it! Wonderful music for lazy spring nights
3,First time buyer,My first introduction to Enya. Several songs appealed to me but most of the album didn't. Just not my taste I guess.
2,I only liked 2 songs!,"I should not have bought this cd. It is really for a true Enya fan. I just like a couple of her songs and assumed I would like most of her music. I didn't. It's not a bad cd, but if you were just looking for mainstream hits, to me it only had a few. The others may have been hits, with Enya fans, but I'm sure the rest us missed them because we just weren't interested. If you're an Enya fan, go for it. If not, don't waste your money."
5,One of the best actual CDs... ever.,"You can do anything to ENYA, it's all up to you. This CD is an absolute masterpiece. Highly recommended to anyone who likes beautiul, melodic music. The Memory Of Trees is one of my favorite songs of all time. This collection has it all."
5,"drama, pride and anger","Without indulging in either flattery or superlatives,I find ""Vietnam Military Lore - Legends, Shadows and Heroes to be the most powerful book ever written on the subject of the Vietnam War. It is head and shoulders over everything else. The magnitude of Bows' research is astounding, and of all people who have wriiten of the war, Bows is a towering figure of truth, an element often either missing or mangled to fit an agenda. Bows deserves a marketing program of the first rank, this book has got to get into the hands of millions of people. I could go on and on about the poignant drama, the pride, the anger and all the elements Bows handles, not adequately, but masterfully. Bob Need, Tan Son Nhut Assn."
3,Dead on Letterman,"Good sound quality from Letterman's vaults, but many of the performers on this CD have been around too long. Quite frankly, this collection resembles the status quo of unchanging music including ""dead"" I mean REAL deadheads. They had their day in the sun -- time to move on!"
1,Sheila Rogers Produced This CD?,"Let's face it, this compilation is so outdated, no wonder it comes in at a whopping 87,000 on Amazon in sales! The singers on this CD are dinosaurs and some are extinct!Regardless, this CD's a good self-promotional tool for one of the Letterman's show music producers, Sheila Rogers which is its real purpose. It's her very first! Seeing how she hasn't produced any other records in her career, one can only guess the recording industry didn't think too highly of Ms. Roger's CD producing stunt.I did some research on this CD's producer and Sheila Rogers is a former Rolling Stone Random Notes gossip columnist who jumped over to Letterman's show as a talent scout, later promoted to being one of the shows music producer's.Ms. Rogers' manipulation of Letterman, who she personally suggested this CD project to, is a testiment to herself. Let me take this opportunity to worship thee, with 1 well deserved star."
4,Good overview of forgotten crafts,"This book provides a good overview of many forgotten crafts. Since the description for each craft is basically a page or two with line drawings of tools used for each craftand occasional old photos of a craftsman at work, it lacks the detail and step by step instructions necessary to learn any of the crafts directly from this book. It's a very interesting book, but if you're looking for a how-to book, look elsewhere. I'd suggest Storey's basic country skills or the more detailed individual Storeys guides."
3,Good but not exactly.....,"Very interesting historically but it didnt have too many ""how - to"" instructions"
2,forgotten crafts,This book is great for research . I bought it because it was (I thought) going to teach me how to do some more things. It did not. I would not buy this again. I'll get rid of my copy as soon as I can.
1,disapointed,I was totally disapointed with this book. It was not what I had expected at all nor what the name implied. I would not recommend it to anyone.
4,The master of self sufficiency strikes again!,"For anyone who aspires to be self sufficient, or maybe just less dependent on others, John Seymour's books are great. They are always loaded with great information and ideas. This book is no exception!"
4,A great comfort in times of hardship,"This is an excellent work to keep in hand in case a giant electrical storm over Nantucket renders all electrical devices in the world inopoperable. You could run a decent sized farming community in, say, the middle of the Oregonian wilderness with the descriptions the book provides!! ""Hail to the Goddess of ripened corn!"""
2,NOT a how-to book!,"This book is more of a visual encyclopedia of the many arts and crafts of the past, with a few pages each. It's not remotely a how-to book!It's more for kids reference than actual adult usefulness. =("
1,"Big Big Big Mistake, Paul","I'm not the biggest Paul Simon fan out there, but I absolutely love his ""Negotiations and Love Songs 1971-'86"" CD. Everything I love about all those songs is NOT PRESENT at all on this Songs From The Capeman. I had no idea there was a musical that these songs came from. My wife and I were excited, hoping to have found another gem. But we got it home and started listening and became DISGUSTED with what we heard. Most of the CD isn't even Paul singing, but a bunch of unknown Puerto Rican singers. The album is fraught with hard cursing and annoying music. We buy music our kids can listen to and enjoy...if you do this too stay far away from this CD. In fact, if you love music at all stay far away from this CD. It is, by far, the worst CD we own, and we own a lot of them, including a bunch by unsigned artists who reek. Paul Simon, please go back to the music we love you for."
4,Terrific,I've always wanted an AfroAmerican supernatural story and this talented young author really delivers. Thunderland is scary. You care about the characters and cringe over their possible fates. I'm anxiously awaiting Mr. Massey's new book.
5,GREAT BOOK,"This book is one for the ages. I really liked everything about this book. I found myself getting upset when i got sleepy, but that was okay, i just set the clock to wake me up a little earlier, so that i could continue Thunderland. Good job Brandon"
3,Good but not Great,"I love Brandon Massey's books. Thunderland seems like it is more of a teenage thriller. I wanted the story to get more into the adult situation between the mother and father. I wanted the book to even get deeper into the relationship between the evil grandfather and his son. Mr. Magic seemed only scary to a teenage audience, i wanted this story to be more like ""Within the Shadows"" now thats the book right there!"
2,Not a book for young adults!,"This was listed as a young adult book, which is why I chose to read it. The main character is young, but the subject matter is NOT. F bombs abound, infidelity, quite graphic sex. I gave up half way through. Too much garbage to plow through."
4,Truly full of suspense!,"I read this book because my book club choose it and I'm glad I did! I must admit, I looked over my shoulder more than once while reading this book at night....I agree with another reviewer - Jason seemed very mature to handle all that he did in the manner that he did. However, I enjoyed how the other family members were woven into the story. And I don't see how they could have been as important to the story if Jason were older.Good work Mr. Massey!"
3,OK Auger,Not really a great product. Does the work on inside house project not firm enough for outside drain problems.
3,"Very good book, if you want to open a resume production biz.","Ms. Melink writes well and includes much information, however it seems geared toward the resume business, vs. a well-rounded secretarial service. The information on what to charge clients is well written and informative."
3,"Classic songs, but sometimes flat and with a rock beat","These are wonderful, classic songs -- and an excellent value. The song book is adorable, and we use it every morning for our Bible time at breakfast. I will probably end up passing the CD on to someone else, though, as it is difficult to listen to. The kids' voices are painfully flat on a few numbers. There is also a jarring and unnecessary rock beat in some of the songs. Maybe an effort to be modern and updated? We much prefer the Patch the Pirate Sunday School Songs CDs."
4,I Grew Up on Wee Sing Bible Songs....,"And now it is so fun passing it along to my friends with children. I still use these songs I learned as a child to remember the books of the Bible, the names of the disciples, and some other simple songs."
2,Would be great if all songs were complete,"This CD contains over 60 songs....but unfortunately, they're not all complete songs. Many of them are under 30 seconds (a single sentence or few brief sentences of a song), and many more are under a minute. The 'songs' are also very fast-paced (which makes it harder to understand the words) - and again, I'd like to reiterate, not full songs. Just as my kids start to sing along, the song is over. I would love to find a CD like this with all of the complete songs on it."
3,Cute for kids,"Its a cute CD with all those familiar sunday school songs you learned as a kid. if you are a VERY conservative christian you may this to be a bit too ""pop"" for your taste and may prefer the Patch The Pirate Sunday School Songs. Overall i think this is a good product"
4,Very nice songs - but too soft,"My son loves the songs in this product, and especially loves to grab the songbook and ask us to sit down so we can sing through them with him. He can already remember at least 5 of the songs and can sing along, only after a few months. Most of the songs are familiar and well delivered.The only issue we have is that the CD itself is very soft, and we have to really amp up our stereo to hear the words sung - takes away just that much ease to use that this review gets one less star."
5,Childhood Favorites,I had this as a cassette tape as a child and about wore it out. Now I play it for the kids I watch and hopefully someday children of my own.
4,fun cd,"I really like the pick of songs on this cd. The quality is not that great for some reason, the sound is really low so I have to turn up the radio real loud in order to hear the songs loudly."
5,great for the little ones in Sunday school,How can you miss with so many songs to choose from? The kids at church will love them especially having the words as well! Love Wee Sing!
4,Kids Love It,"If you want your kids to learn Bible principles, sing and have fun this sing Bible songs is great for the little ones. My 5 and 2 year old kids love it and my 11 year old loves to sing with them and help them learn the lyrics. Much better then having your kids listen to now a days music that has negative messages projected to them."
5,Love this CD for my pre-schoolers,"I love this CD! I had it on cassette tape, but bought the CD recently for easier use. I was also worried I would eventually wear out the tape after using it for so many years. When my son was growing up, we listened to it in the car for at least 2-3 years. (He's now 22 yrs old.) I think it planted many ""seeds"" to cultivate and help him learn Bible stories for us to discuss. I also learned the books of the Bible from listening to it. I use some of the songs for my pre-school choir at church. There are songs, however, that are a little too advanced for my kids that would be good for elementary age. Hope you enjoy it!"
1,Never got it,I was so excited to get it for my baby girl :( I think I'll just get it from a Christian book store :(
2,Great features - not stable,"Having gone through pictureit & DIP-7 we thought this would add some features and resolve some of the stability problems. But, this version is less stable and says some features are ""not implemented"". It seems to loose system resources, making us have to reboot. It will not edit pictures in a composite any more. Overall, it just does not feel like quality software. After several years with pictureit, it may be time to move to adobe."
3,It's not Photoshop,"I've always used Adobe Photoshop in the past and have loved it. But, we recently upgraded our computer, so our old Photoshop is no longer compatible. So, we went with Digital Image Pro 9. It has alot of what Photoshop offered, but the layout and the way toolbars and task bars are presented is horrible. I think the product was created to help those who have very little image enhancement skills. I would like to see Digital Image allow me to do some manual enhancements and changed to my photos and images. Overall, it's doing its job, but with some slight frustrutions. I just purchased it a couple days ago and am still trying to find a way to customize my toolbars...don't think it's even an option! I'm also looking for a way to make the background of an image transparent so that it can go on a website without a block of white around it. So far, no can do.If you have the money, go with Adobe Photoshop which is quite pricey, but worth it in the long run."
3,I'm glad I only paid $9.99,"This a good editing software. I think I got my money's worth. It is worth the $15 they are charging now too. I would have been really pissed if I had paid the full retail price. It's like a lot Microsoft software pretty good but no spectactular. Basically, they had a few billon laying around and they decided to dabble in photo editing software."
1,"Great start for an image editor, overwrote ""my Pictures""","On install the 1st problem encountered was that it replaced my pictures folder, with another containing only ""sample picture"", yep it took out a folder on install with no request or user action to do so. Regardless of how it works as an image editor such behaviour precludes its further use.This program seems to be unsupported by MicroSoft, least their support site won't let you mail them on it, so when it does hack up your file structure. SO program cost me $15 recovery effort on pictures, over $50. Just wonderful."
2,Versatile Program - But Too Many Crashes,"Microsoft has enhanced Picture It Pro 9 with many uselful features - Batch Editing; Picture Straightening; Cut-Out tools; filters, etc. PI Pro 9 has enough tools to satisfy even the most demanding Prosumer. HOWEVER, the program is very unstable, especially if you do a lot of composites as I do. You can be assured that the program will crash at least once every session while working on ""complex"" compositions using multiple image files. Many complaints have been registered with MS Customer Service (check out some of the other feedbacks sites) but yet no patches or updates have been issued. If you want ""professional"" resutls go with PhotoShop."
2,Poor on the most basic level,"This software does not provide even the basic red eye fix. It turns them a light shade of grey, maybe. It is horrible. This to me renders it useless.It is for the most basic of users. There are no real manual functions to speak of, and my free software does a better red eye and also lets me do red eye manually when they cannot detect it.It has some neat functions but since it could not provide the most common need correctly,I would say do not buy. Seller was great, product is poor."
5,In general,I can't address the advisability of upgrading but I can give my impressions of the program. I have had a dark room since I was 12 (I am 51 now) and only recently came to digital. This is by far the best and easiest program I have found for the serious amateur. While Adobe Print Shop may have more to offer the professional it is far too cumbersome and complex (not to mention expensive) for the amateur. I have done so much with this program and truly enjoy working on it.
3,Things to know before upgrading...,"If you are a user of DIP7 you may want to stick with what you have. Although there are many new features such as smart erase and updated menus, there are a few kinks.Examples...If you apply an effect to an image - conrast, edges, transparency etc. - once you click done you cannot adjust that particular setting again. For example, if you want to make an object transparent so you can work behind it, you will not be able to restore that object to its original state when you are done. The same goes for soft edges. If you feel you would like to adjust the edge you applied a few steps back, you're out of luck.I personally don't know why they call it an upgrade if they remove features as well.Overall, this is a great program and if you've never used another version of DIP you might be satisfied, but if you have... consider it carefully before upgrading."
2,Microsoft Digital ImagePro 9.0,It isn't very user friendly. I have other software that is much easier (Adobe Photo Shop). This one will take some time and effort to get used to and work with.
4,Best first book if you are curious about World Economy,"This is an excellent book for a novice/beginner, who is trying to understand the basics and scope of the World Economy in plain english."
3,What the **** is a stock option?,"Have you asked this question before? Or any innumerable other ones regarding business or economics?Well, this is the book for you. Randy Charles Epping is not going to win the Nobel Prize for literature any time soon; but, he has produced an excellent book about what going on in the world economy. His non-jargon based explanations of everything from GDP to stock options to how the Federal Reserve works are enough to shine some light on the, often mystical, world of the Nightly Business Report. Epping answers 81 questions with succinct clarity.While, I would not say this book is a must read, I would say that if you wanted to know what are this stuff was, you should pick it up."
1,Steinhardt the Blowhard...,"Dull, pompous pablum - with surprising little insight into both the markets and Steinhardt's reasoning for the trades he describes in his book. This gives credence to the likelihood that Steinhardt is nothing more than an outlier along the curve (in other words, extremely lucky) Given the amount of money this guy made, his philanthropic ""vision"" is extremely narrow and self-serving. Pass this one by..."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book after hearing it was not written as an ego builder by the author. Unfortunately I was disappointed after realizing Mr. Steinhardt's account of his father is a little too close to the character played by Chazz Palminteri in ""A Bronx Tale"". Although I could get past a little embellishment, it seems Mr. Steinhardt's Wharton education and his initial entrance into the market was bankrolled by his criminally motivated father. I found it extremely disappointing that Mr. Steinhardt glorifies his Bar Mitzvah ""gifts"" from his father and then would have us feel sorry for him for what he had to go through as a Jewish American in the military, etc. Sorry, but it seems Mr. Steinhardt speaks out of both sides of his mouth which doesn't exactly build credibility. One quote from the book..in describing his stock picking ability...""it was as if I had a direct line to God""...give me a break, is nothing sacred!"
1,A truly awful book,"This is probably the worst book on investing I have ever read.Firstly, Steinhardt does not give any insights into investing at all. I do understand this, as frankly why would anyone give any great ideas away for the cost of a paperback. But he should add value in some other way then. Instead the book goes on and on about his religious background, which is absolutely of no interest to me.If you want to learn life lessons that shaped the way a great trader looks at the market, read The Education of a Speculator by Victor Niederhoffer. If you want to read about the religious background of a famous trader, then pick up this book."
3,A little disappointing,"This is an enjoyable book but I came away a little disappointed because there was not enough explanation of his investment philosophy that has clearly been so successful over time. The ""variant perception"" chapter is fascinating but I would have liked more in depth explanation."
1,Absolutely Bullcrap...waste of time,"Unless you are interested in the life of a young Jew growing up in Brooklyn, or the name-dropping and meandering political thoughts of a megomaniac, this book is a complete waste of time and money. There is very little to no insight in this book on how Michael Steinhardt viewed or traded the markets (his Market Wizards interview has much more depth and detail).A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME"
2,"A story, no finance details","Michael Steinhardt tells the story of his life, but leaves out all the interesting financial stuff. He rarely tells how he made his 30%/year, and when this is mentioned there are no details."
3,Useful--up to a point,"It's always revealing to read about the life of a well-reputed money manager, and Steinhardt is no exception. This book is disarming by revealing intriguing details of Steinhardt's life and intriguing snippets of his management of one of the Street's premiere hedge funds.Its biggest virtue is personal honesty. For example, Steinhardt concedes that he is an ""unpleasant boss"" and notes that it was ""not his job to be nice."" It is good to see him admit that he was, at times, a ""tyrant"" -- particularly when you contrast his honesty on this score to the syrupy recent biography of Julian Robertson, which covered up for his notorious bad temper.My problem with this book is that it fails to deliver on its most crucial selling point, which is to discuss Steinhardt as a trader and investor. We do get snippets, but not enough. What is here in this book is good stuff, but one leaves it feeling disappointed."
3,"Good biography, but not so good on investment/trading tactics.","I bought the book to gain some trading insight from one of the greatest hedge fund managers ever, but it left me wanting. About 1/2 the book deals with religious and cultural issues regarding his heritage. His most profound investment ideas had more to do with the bond market, not the stock market. He detailed one trade in Occidental Petroleum that went bad for him, but didn't go into details."
1,this is the worst invetment book I have read,"This man was a legendary trader on wall street due to his amazing returns year after year, but his book is such a waist of time, very boring and it does not teach you anything. A great disappointment and unbearably boring. I was looking for some insight, but nothing. The worst I read this year out of 15 investment books."
3,"It may have warts, but it's the only option","This book is the only up-to-date guide to the minutae of the ANSI/ISO C++ IOStreams framework, and it's hugely detailed. It's not easy to follow, even by the standards of this field, and the code samples aren't the best, but if you need to understand IOStreams you have no choice."
4,Good book and you will know learn alot from it!,"I'm giving her 4 stars because I didn't like her pedagogical method of showing you ""the bad things first and the good method later"". Perhaps, I'm the problem and not her so it might be wrong to take points off from her rating. Having said that, she does a really good job of showing you the internals about IOstreams. Overall, I definitely learned a lot from this book and a If you need to understand IOstreams, you should take a look of this book."
4,Very technical but worth the read and the wait,Two of my favorite C++ article authors have put out a VERY useful book for someone who already has a good grasp of C++ but now wants to have a mastery of IOStreams.
5,Indispensible Guide to IOStreams,"This book is as indispensible to the serious C++ programmer as guides to the Standard Containers (STL) parts of the C++ standard library, and arrived in the bookstores in time to be the standard work on the subject for years to come.It is well written and lucid, and despite the authors claim to minimize the number of actual examples, contains sufficient snippets of usable code to be practically useful."
3,Too many redundant comments and words.,"The authors has excellent knowledge of the subject, but that is sadly not of benefit for this book, on the contrary it is its problem. The book seams to be written in the following way:1. Rewrite iostreams header files as english text instead of c++.2. If at any point, you can make a long remark about some detail, do so. The longer the better.Usually when an author it trying to make a book as thick as possible, it is done by adding redundant words to make it easier to read, not in this case, the sentenses have no flow, its just a large collection of words.I would recommend reading this book to anyone implementing the subject from scratch (for his own compiler) and to people stranded on desert islands. The rest of us can read existing header files, contemplate them and still have time to spare.Life is too short for spending time reading the same thing i just read, over and over again."
4,portable weather indictor,I really liked the big display on the main unit. The convinience of being cable free meant I could transfer the main unit and remote sensor anywhere. The main drawback of this device is its inability to receive the remote sensor's readings if it is located in between a cement wall.
2,First time Lonely Planet was so inaccurate,"Wow this book is out dated! I went to the Dead Sea in Israel in May 2010. The owner of the bungalows I thought to stay at laughed at the quoted rate that was about 10% of what he wanted. This happened in Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Israel and of course Palestine. I use Lonely Planet all the time and this is the first time I have been disappointed.The general knowledge seemed up to LPs normal quality."
1,Inaccurate,"This book is very disappointing, repetitive, misspelled, and not worth reading. The book is poorly researched, the information, and photographs have no value."
2,The usual inquirer garbage.,"The writer has no first hand interviews of anyone who has or had a personal relationship with the actor. He never delves into where the actor gets his characters souls from.This writer only seems concerned with the fact that Mr. DeNiro prefers black women.The question that begs to be asked is ""What in God's name do black women see in Mr. DeNiro""?"
1,"Too general, too elementary","This book appears as though it was written very generically as the template of a series about starting businesses, and then customized only slightly by the individual type of business. There's a lot of talk about how to select a computer and what kind of work ethic you ought to develop, bookkeeping, and even an entire chapter about choosing the right business! One would think that by the time this book is in hand, that decision had already been made. A disappointment."
5,Love this book!,"I bought this book for my 1 year old, and she immediately got really interested in it. She loves to put the animals in the pockets, even though not the right ones yet :) The fish bowl is her favorite ""home"" and so far everything from fish to cow goes right in there :)There are 8 animals, and 8 pages with ""homes"" for them. Everything is really well made and colorful - great design. The animals are recognisable and durable. My daughter has fun learning the names of the animals, the sounds they make, and where they live.I am so happy with this product, that I bought this book again, for my friend baby's birthday. I'm sure she'll love it, too."
5,Cute book!,My daughter got this when she was a baby and has loved it ever since. Now at 2 she practices the letters and spelling the names of the animals to put them away. All of her friends that come over to play love it too so we just bought it as a gift for a friend. Great book for a wide range of ages!
3,Cheaply made?,"I'm a little bit mixed about my review. The other reviewers rave about how well-made and durable the book is. I'm wondering if I was shipped a book that missed the quality control inspection? There are tons of loose threads hanging off in many places. The yellow pockets that hold the animals in their place inside the cover are sewn on crooked. Also, the piece of velcro that holds the turtle in the turtleshell is so tiny that it is already losing its ""stick factor"" after only 3 weeks of play. Overall, it seems the quality is just not there.I do love the concept of the book, and my 14-month old has fun with it. Her favorite page is the fishbowl, and she likes to put all of the animals in the fishbowl. I enjoy the fact that the book zips up to keep everything together.I'm hoping that I just got a ""fluke"" of a book, and that not all of these are like this? Or maybe my expectations were just a little bit too high."
5,great book!,This book is well made and unique. My 17 month old loves it. My 5 year old even plays with it. I would buy it again.
5,Great book.,"This book is not intended to replace videos or rolling to improve your Jiu-Jitsu. However, this book is must for any Gracie Jiu-Jitsu practioner or Helio Gracie admirer. Numerous color photos of the late great Helio Gracie in his 90's performing hundreds of moves on son Rorion. Also included are some vintage black & white photos of Helio competing in the 1930's. Excellent color photography by Thomas DeSoto. Buy it."
5,Great book but private sellers need to get a reality check,"Amazing book, but it's only 69.95 on most fighting supply store websites. $300 is absolutley insane. For that the book better make me breakfast in the morning."
2,A dream too sweet for its own good.,"If you marveled at the masterfully crafted piano/bass duo of ""Night and the City,"" or if the evocative americana of ""Beyond the Missouri Sky"" sent you traveling through familiar yet eerily beautiful soundscapes, be forewarned: this one's made of different stuff . Listening to this recording, the adjective that comes to mind is ""cloying."" Haden's earlier effort, ""Nocturne"", had come perilously close, but ""America the Beautiful"" definitely crosses the line. This music is far too sweet, too syrupy, too shallow - the only exception, ironically enough, being the title tune, which exudes a kind of stately grace and an inner strength which I find quite moving (and for which I give this CD its second star.)"
5,Touching. Heard on the radio,"Couldn't expect less with such musicians. Top quality of music. I do recommand this kind of music to anyone who likes that kind of jazz.Sorry, I do not indicate friends addresses. Confidenciality matters."
2,Nap through this one,"Anyone familiar with Charlie Haden's duo or trio work might be dissapointed by American Dream. Haden has always managed to express sentiment without added sweetner but this recording is over the top on production and orchestration. Think of a jazz version of the abysmal Elvis Costello/Bert Bacharach outing.Some of the best contemporary American jazz musicians, Haden, Keith Jarrett, Pat Metheny, etc. have kept their distance from the easy listening and retro styles that dominate ""popular"" jazz radio while still creating accessable music, moody, thoughful and often beautiful. They share that ECM avant-garde edge with European counterparts like Tomasz Stanko, Bobo Stenson, Tord Gustavsen and Keitel Bjornstad. Unfortunately, American Dreams is a lot closer to Yanni than to The Liberation Orchestra."
1,Do not buy this album if you are less than 90 years old...,"This is one of the most bland and pointless albums I have heard in a long time. However, the title is entirely appropriate because it will put you asleep. It amazes me that despite the caliber of musicians enlisted for the project, they have managed to make an hour of music with not one inspired moment. How Charlie Haden managed to make Michael Brecker and Brad Mehldau play like they were hired for the retirement home chili cook-off instead of the consummate musicians they are, some of the best ever on their respective instruments, is beyond me. Do not buy this album, unless you need a cure for insomnia or need an $18 coaster."
2,you could do a lot better,"This was okay for a while, and it is nice to have an alarm that automatically goes off at the same time every weekday. But the reason you need it on this thing is that the controls to set the alarm are kind of tricky; I needed the manual to redo it every time. Now, after ~14 months of use, the sleep timer/light (it's the same button) doesn't work, or works after the fifteenth try. I have to buy a new alarm clock already."
2,My Review,"A decent Pocket Guide, as it did fit in my jacket pocket. However, only the maps and U-Bohn (Metro Transit) guide were of value. The sights, food, and entertainment sections were limited. In fact, most of the sights numbered on the map did not have a corresponding description. Although it is understandbly a Pocket Guide, for the price and size, it should have had better content."
5,"Great kids' book, or GREATEST kids' book?","How on earth is this out of print? This was one of our family's favourite books when my sister and I were growing up, and made such an impact that we still make reference to it in passing conversation (as so many of the great children's books make you do, like Paper Bag Princess, Big Orange Splot, Going on a Bear hunt, Mud Puddle, etc).I was looking to buy it for a young friend, and am heartbroken it's not available. A must-read if you can find it."
5,Not just for kids!,A truly goofy and madcap romp with charming illustrations that has reduced every fellow college student I've shared it with to peals of uncontrollable laughter. Sure to be a hit in homes of families that love to read and giggle together. No real educational or social value here-- just plain fun. Too much more information would ruin the enjoyment of a first-time reading
4,Better than nothing,"This is a much shorter brush than any I've seen before. Even so, there are limitations where it can be used. If you have a 10/22 for example, it won't fit - its still too long. A S&W 617 .22, it won't fit there either. When it comes time to use a brush, better to either take down the gun and do a proper cleaning, longer brush than this. Or, for intermediate bore cleaning, use a bore snake."
1,"Cognition Cram 101 ""review""",They call this a review? you pay 7.95 for the vocabulary words from Cognition the TEXTBOOK! THIS IS MISSED LABELED! IT SHOULD READ CRAM 101 COGNITION REVIEW NOT COGNITION BY MAITLIN.
4,ANOTHER EXCITING ACTION MOVIE,"A TRIAD BOSS HEARS THAT SOMEONE IS OUT TO KILL HIM. SINCE HE HAS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PROTECT HE HAS A GROUP OF GANGSTERS PROTECTING HIM. HOWEVER, WHO CAN HE TRUST AND WHO AMONG THEM IS OUT TO KILL HIM ?"
2,"Not a good book for Exam Guide, maybe reference","This book, while obviously having loads of information, is not as helpful as its price should indicate. I found many small typos throughout the book, and there are numerous times that I found actually incorrect information. After studying this book very heavily, I found that it only mentioned about two-thirds of what I actually found on the test (CSPFA 642-521). When I took the test, I was completely surprised by much of the information. The packaged test in the book is really just a test on the book itself, and does not represent the actual test very well (CSPFA 642-521). This book does have a lot of information, and can be used as a study guide, but I would absolutely recommend buying another book to supplement it, or taking a course."
4,Love This Bag,"This bag is almost as good as the real thing! I was very impressed with how it looked, if you are like me and you can't afford the real thing then look no more this is a great bag."
3,Bookshelf,A lot smaller than expected and I wish the top had larger book ends. Books don't seem to stand up very well. Very cute in a little boy's room though!
5,"Wonderful, pure escapism!","I first read this book some 20 years ago, and it has haunted me ever since. I truely wonderful bit of sci-fi spanning time, space and mortality. Whilst it was in my possession I read it many many times, but made the unfortunate mistake of lending it to someone, never to see it again. Some time later I discovered the LaNague chronicles (encapsulating ""Healer"") and got the book. Whilst Healer remains my all time favorite, LaNague is almost as good a read. Should anyone know of or have contact with Mr F Paul Wilson, would they extend my thanks, and plead with him on my behalf to put pen to paper (or fingers to key-board) and produce further ""Steve & pard"" novels, as there is far to much meat on this bone to let them off travelling the universe and time in just one book!"
5,A great read!,I have always liked this book since I found it in a second-hand book store years ago (Why anyone would want to dump this book is beyond me). I keep coming back to it and re-reading it just to immerse myself in the imaginative and well-written tale of an ordinary man who has immortality unexpectedly thrust upon him. How he deals with this and the huge scale of the book (both in time and space) make for a great read.
3,Interesting,"The premise is interesting, but, as the author admits in his introduction, it is more a series of short stories about the same character. I feel it needed more development and fleshing out to make a true novel."
2,"Book great, Amazon lousy","I had read this book and wanted to read it again. Unfortunately the only way that I was allowed to purchase it was as a kindle to be read online. This ruined my pleasure as I had wanted to download my PURCHASE onto my ipad for future reading. As I paid the money, I should be allowed to read it on the computer of my choice. This is very frustrating and I am peeved. It does not make me want to use Amazon for purchases. Maybe Amazon is just too big. Anyway, I will see if I can get it at a bookstore instead as this sucks big time!!!"
3,"Cute, but not what I had hoped",This is a cute clock until the light in the tail burns out. Can't find a replacement bulb anywhere and no response from Oregon Scientific. It is nice that the time sets itself but I lost the book and can't figure out how to set the alarm.
2,Is this how it is supposed to work?,"I bought this item at a store in Pennsylvania. The first problem was that the automatic time synchronization did not work. Perhaps Pennsylvania is out of range of the radio signal from the U.S. Atomic Clock? That meant that I had to set the time manually. Setting the day of the week is not described in the manual and does not seem to follow any discernable logic. It takes a while to realize that digits 8 to 99 in the 1 to 99 counter serve no function. OK, but I have had to do this about every couple of weeks, because the batteries don't last very long. Is this how this clock is supposed to work? I sent that question in an e-mail to Oregan Scientific but I have not been graced with a reply."
2,Problems with remote outdoor temperature,"The nice, big size of the displays is great. However, there is rarely a temperature reading from the outdoor sensor."
3,"Schenkers back,tobad the restof the band isnt","For Longtime Schenker fans,I would say this is Michaels best lead guitar playing in the past 10+ years,On this CD his Solos BURN and has a intensity that was long missed in earlier releases.(Im one who thinks things went down hill after the McauleySchenkerGroup).There are things lacking in this CD though,mainly that all the parts where recorded n mixed at seperate locatons,leaving a very unhuman feel to the songs,there is absoulutley NO jamming on this CD unlike its title :(,to bad though ,because I think it would have had more spontenaity if all the band memebers where in the SAME room ,and laid tracks down Togeather or at least had more communcation musically,this CD lacks that magical musical interplay.Nonetheless I like this CD,Schenker as stated plays great on this release,and Pattison is good though he doesnt push his voice or have much of a range."
4,Classic Michael,"This is a neat cd! These covers represent some of the great classic rock bands I've seen! Schenkers guitar work is the best we've heard since the Uli Roth jam. The main disappointment is Leslie West, again! Leslie had a great band back in the early seventies. However, time and time again you hear him play Theme From an Imaginary Western and he butchers it everytime. He's the only guitarist I've seen that cannot come close to reproducing a solo after the original cut? Leslie, don't play the song if you can't get it somewhat to sound like the original! Anyway, I would recommend this to any Schenker fan just to hear his great guitar!"
2,Missing In Action,"Since you do not have Since I Don't Have You, what is yet another retread compilation without much thought about the songs but the position on some chart. Where are the creative types that select the gems that did not chart well? Come on folks. Stop the Nina Simone-ization of Patti! Even the Essential Patti LaBelle wasn't all that inclusive."
3,Not the original...cheap copy,"This is not the original toy. My dogs has had several and we love them, but this one is much softer than the original. Being so soft means that it will not last and the dog can easily chew it apart."
2,"Not for a tougher ""chewer""","I have purchsed the Wiggly Giggly ball, bone a jack toys for my Border Collie. She absolutely loves them but has the whistle-type noise-makers out of the toy within a day. They are a choke hazard for the hard chewer. A more laid back dog who looves the noises and isn't going too chew too much would love these."
3,"The dog wasn't mad about it. But, it's a good toy.",The lab likes it.but it's not a favorite of his. Good product. Just not his favorite. Maybe he'll enjoy it more int the future.
1,Not a durable toy!!!,"Our dog has the large ball and a plush toy that makes the same sound. We all laugh at the sounds these toys make and our dog has a ball playing with them. However, within 5 minutes of receiving this bone, he had chewed into one of the ends. I think, if you are going to buy this toy, you had better supervise your pet closely!!!! We threw the toy out that day so it was a big waste of money. Our dog still loves and plays with the ball and plush toy and doesn't try to destroy either one of them."
5,dog toy,My dog likes this bone it easy for her to pick up and play with it on her own.It is good for a small dog that weights 16lbs and up.
2,too soft,my dogs chewed through this toy in thirty minutes. they are not large dogs with big teeth. it can be quite dangerous if they eat the pieces of the toy. it's a shame cuz they love the noise!
1,broken in two minutes,This was the worst waste of money I have ever encountered on amazon. This toy is advertised for dogs when it obviously does NOT stand up to dog teeth. Two minutes into playing with this toy and it was punctured and didn't make noise anymore. My dog is not a chewer it was just from typical run around and shake it play that this toy broke under. My advice never purchase one of these even if you have a toy breed they are crap toys and I am quite irritated at this wasted expense.
1,looks like seconds to me,the first one I got the paint was coming off the letter p and s and the white is missing around the word packers..the second one i got the white is missing from around the word packers..I wasn't even going to try a 3rd one.They got me but never again !!!
5,Minimal is better!,"love this little guy! looks great on my Ram and the reception is perfect, no difference with the factory antenna on!"
4,A very nice travel alarm clock.,"This little alarm clock is really nice. It is very slim when closed, is easy to set and always displays the alarm time in the corner (as opposed to only showing the alarm time if you change the display). I plan on purchasing another of these."
4,Almost but not quite!!,"Having read Silver Flame and Forbidden before this I was very interested in the infamous couple that came before the children - and while I enjoyed Blaze and Hazard I felt the stories of Trey & Daisy much more erotic and compelling. For Johnson this was pretty tame. And the reviewer that mentioned unresolved issues-I agree, what made Hazard all of a sudden forgive Blaze that night in bed - and really why did he not have more faith in her to begin with - it is not like Hazzard had as so many men issues of trust. Still in order to complete the series this is a good compliment book and a good solid 4 star romance."
3,No cultured woman would act that way!,"The author had a good story outline, but added some very sloppy scenes that should have been crafted to enhance the story. Our heroine, being very sophisticated, would never have been so submissive right off the bat. The couple's first ""encounter"" almost made me throw the tape away. And it got worse. Her captivity in the cabin was not at all real, not for the sophisticated upbringing she supposedly had, and not for the fiery rebel she was supposed to be. How stupid and submissive the author made her out to be. Nope, didn't buy it. What a shame to ruin such an interesting story line."
1,Horrible,"This book was so disappointing. The hero was OK, but I really didn't like the heroine. The hero has sex with way too many women in the book. I don't mind a promiscuos hero at all, but I'd rather the author TALK about the hero's past instead of writing about his sex he has with women that aren't the heroine, in such graphic detail (and I am certainly no prude). I couldn't even stomach to read the rest of the book. Avoid this at all costs!"
1,typical and tiring,If i was an Native american I would gag over this book and allothers just like it. The same old tired out formula.Indian hero fallsfor a white woman. How about an exciting book about 2 Native American lovers. I look and look. Are there any Native American writers out there who could accomplish such a task? END
1,"$40, really?","Looks like an interesting book to read, but just because someone thinks it's a text book, it's $40? And we wonder why the cost of college is so high..."
4,Good for the price,"These chips are pretty good for the price. If you want high quality clay chips you will have to pay 5 times this price for them. They are clay for sure. One of my buddies didn't believe it, so we broke one to see. It took a lot of force to break it. I would buy another set if I needed it, but with this many chips, you can play a lot of people. My only complaint is the packaging. It was packed with foam peanuts and they stuck to everything and made a mess."
4,"Good Quality, Great Design","Overall I'm pretty happy with this set at $69. The chips are of good quality. The reviewer who said he could make indentations in the chip with his nail was right; I could do the same thing. But I could do the same thing with another set of cheapo plastic chips (with metal inserts) I have as well. The Wheatears stack better and have a less slick surface that ordinary composite chips.I think the phrase ""Real Clay"" is misleading since these chips are a plastic composite and real clay chips would cost hundreds for a set of 500. I do appreciate the elegant design though; different from the usual.I don't expect much from the flimsy cards that usually come with poker sets, but this one was a pleasant surprise. Sure they weren't name-brand cards, but they had enough heft and resilience that I might actually use these instead of throwing them away. I'll add to this review if the chips or the cards show any wear beyond the ordinary."
5,Texas Hold'em Poker Chip Set for Christmas,"If you want to give a gift for Christmas to someone who enjoys poker, look no further. 100% accurate description of product plus fast shipping. Bought 2 sets and I think my family will be thrilled because high quality and truly a set that will last a lifetime. I couldn't be happier."
4,Gift for Son-in-law,He really loves the poker set- except for the lavender chips. He got 3 rows of them. He really likes the cards that were used in the casinos too.
3,"Good set, but wrong colors sent","This chip set is good quality for its price, but my major gripe is that I was sent 150 yellow chips instead of 150 white chips, as pictured. The product details do not specify what colors are sent, so Chipsandgames will send you whatever colors they have in stock (this is what they said when I called them). In order to exchange the chips, you have to pay for shipping yourself. If you order the chips from [...] directly, you can specify the color and quantity of chips you want. Also, there is a defect on the bottom side of the case."
1,Nice Chips,"Hi. I just bought these poker chips and..well im impressed. for 50 bucks (including shipping) its a hellova nice deal. it even comes with a aluminum case, key and lock for case, and dealer,small blind,big blind,(i have NO clue what these are for)kill,reserved, and missed blind. can somebody tell me PLZ what thhe kill,reserved, and missed blind are for? Anyway, a unbeatable set of chips for the price"
3,Okay......,"Good points: Compact, looks nice, time set itself within an hour even though cellphones, pagers, palm pilots work erratically here. Less than good points: Instructions incomprehensible, alarm barely audible (to a hard-of-hearing person). Worth it for the auto-time and accurate temperature display."
2,Sweet Dreams,"Proving that inspiration can strike anywhere, anytime, Claire finds hers scrawled across a bathroom wall. Urged to find a life, she takes off to find her long absent father. Shreveport no longer feels like home since her husband dumped her. However, her destination, Valentine, gives her what she was missing- surrogate relatives from parents to a pregnant teen who needs mothering herself, and an interesting man who is interested in her. Just when life has a more rosy tinge, her cheating ex realizes that she was worth holding onto and how foolish he was to let her get away, making her wonder if the way back is the way forward.Eccentrics give the novel color, much like Steel Magnolias or other Southern chick lit might have. The emails between Claire's surrogate mother and her love interest throw the narrative off a bit, however. It does, to on the positive side, have a good heart to power the story."
5,Bunnies are so delicious as lettuces,Beatrix Potter works are eternal. There is no age for appreciation of her lovely drawings and delicious stories. My love for her work has lasting a lifetime.
2,disappointing misfire,"I'm a big VR fan, and I found this album a curious disappointment. It lacked the focus, drive, and fire of his previous two releases with Masque. With the exceptions of Flatbush and Church Revisited and Enjoy the Silence, I found the performances and compositions/ arrangements to be weak and uninspired, utterly unlike the live performance I saw shortly before this release. I hope he finds his footing again with the next Masque or LC album."
1,Don't bother!! There were plenty of videos with Lionel Richie!!!,"Why bother releasing a compilation dvd collection if the best videos are not included!? I also find it misleading that the original lineup (including Lionel Richie) is on the front cover and the only video on this dvd with Lionel Richie was ""Saturday Night!"" That was an awesome video although a single for it was never released. I'll give you a list of all Commodores videos that I know of that had the original lineup thats is missing from this set: 1)Brick House 2)Sail On 3)Still 4)Lady (You Bring Me Up) 5)Oh No. There was a video for ""Reach High"" that was also excluded from the dvd that was recorded and released after Lionel Richie left the Commodores! There was no excuse for this poorly constructed, lazy excuse for a Commodores dvd compilation."
1,Commodores 20,The entire DVD was lip sinfing not a real concert. I hated it and could not finish watching it. Not worth it.
3,Very Creative,Ms. Wekre is very adept at every technique she is asked to perform. She makes Madsen's Op.24 alone worth buying this album. It has it all from incredible rapidfire horn work to rapidfire piano virtuosity. It has heartmelting melodies and aurally delicious chords. I performed it for my Senior Recital in college. The rest of the pieces are also good. The solo horn pieces are haunting and mournful. You will feel alone in the dark woods. The accompanied ones are quirky and untiring on the ears.
5,Wonder Nutrient,"Great, research based information about the healing/curative/life saving power of this long overlooked nutrient in many of the most challenging health issues found in modern medicine. ALA appears to be a ""miracle drug"" nutrient as it attacks the free radicals that cause most all of the damage to our body's cellular structures. GREAT READ AND VERY APPLICABLE and PRACTICAL and the INFO is indeed life-saving in our modern lives!"
4,All My Desire,Good Story!I enjoyed this book. This is the first book I have read from this author. I hope I enjoy her other books. I would recommend it to anyone who loves romance. I would have liked a better ending; like the old knight that taught Alexander left him his land or his grandfather on his mother's side left him his holdings. Loved it though.
3,It was ok,"This was an easy read and part of a series. I'm not a big fan of the revenge plot and I just didn't see how this was going to work out well in the end. The author managed to pull it off but I think when I read a historical romance I want the H to be a lord or a knight or something. If you're prepared to settle for a mediocre solution then you'll be fine with this one. I think that after reading the other 2 books in the series, this was a little disappointing."
4,Wonderful singing!,"I love this opera and I love ballet, so I put this dvd in my wish list for Christmas. I got it. The music is wonderful and the singing is excellent. At the end, they all got a prolongued standing ovation from the entire Paris Opera House, and I'm sure they deserve it. But it was modern dance not ballet, and the entire going ons by the dancers seemed extrenous, superfluous to the music and singing, not an extension of it. There is no explanation of why Orpheus appears naked and three of the male dancers are wearing leather aprons, or why a couple of the male dancers appear to be dressed in black suits. I personally, did not like it.Many of the dance sequences were boring and seemed to go on interminably, distracting from the music,This naked Orpheus did not look at all like the mythical demigod of the story, but just like a young, regular, male dancer.The best visual part of this DVD is the picture in front."
3,Skivies do not belong in Gluck,Generally excellent. Performed with great dignity. I found the overstuffed chairs ludicrous but they're scarcely visible. The dancers in the metal shop aprons were acceptable. But for me the jocks wandering around in white shorts distroyed the tone of the piece. Eurydike was dressed in a very red red.
2,"Tried Two Recipes, Very Displeased","I gave this book 2 stars only because I have two recipes to go on and I should try a few more, but, that being said, I normally can finish a mediocre meal if it contains vegetables and benefits my health. I could not finish the two recipes I made and am very disappointed. If I do try another recipe in this book, I'll come back and review again, but as of right now, I would not recommend this book."
3,Excellent Product ... Last Year,"This thermometer belongs to an older line of offerings from Oregon Scientific. The new models are out. One problem is that the sensor from this thermometer will not talk to the newer main units. So unless you plan to buy 3 these older units right now, you may have problem getting sensors for all three channels used by this thermometer.As for the quality of Scientific Oregon thermometers, they are great. I have 3 units, 2 from their older line and one from their new line. They are all very accurate, the readings from my 3 sensors and 3 main units varies by no more then 0.7 degree F."
2,Very Inaccurate at low temperatures,"The design and idea of this is great. However, even though I remember reading that it is accurate to the low twenties I have never seen it go below 37 degrees. Right now it is Jan. 3, I am looking out the window and there is frost on the ground. The radio announced it is 27 degrees out. Two other thermometers here read below thirty. However, the Oregon Scientific thermometer reads 37 degrees! Also, the indoor reading in the bottom right corner reads 2+ degrees higher than two other thermometers. I would return this, but I bought it last spring and it is too late."
5,An engrossing tale of Olmsted's life and work,"Witold Rybczynski tells the roundabout tale of how F.L. Olmsted Sr. became the dominant force in the nascent field of landscape architecture in the late 19th century. The cast of supporting characters reads as a who's who of 19th century American artists, from A.J. Downing to H.H. Richardson. All of Olmsted's major influences and landscape projects are chronicled, including great detail on Central Park, Boston's Emerald Necklace, and the Biltmore estate. After reading this book, I visited the Boston parks again and saw them for the first time as they were meant to be seen. [For more on the creation of Boston's Emerald Necklace, see Cynthia Zaitzevsky's ""Frederick Law Olmsted and the Boston Park System,"" Belknap Pr;"
5,"Compassionate, intellegent writing","Reading this biography of the seminal American park planner was thrilling to this landscape professional. But even more was the realization that an imperfect, frustrating career produced such great work. It gave me hope for my own.I enjoyed how deeply the author explored the personal experience of F.L. Olmsted, but I suspect the picture is not balanced. How could a father, sometimes absent, sometimes depressed only be the warm family man that W.R. describes? Surely, I am judging the subject from culture steeped in psychology, but if W.R. is going to apply modern psychological perspective to a pre-psychology subject, he should at least acknowledge that there are probably unstated qualities and events that do not surface in letters."
3,An Error in the Distance,"Olmsted's contributions deserve a longer, and better book. This book, while occasionally enjoyable and informative, was marred by a minor (perhaps telling) error.The man's name was Thurlow Weed, not Weed Thurlow; he was an important enough figure in 19th century America that I (a non-historian) caught the mistake right away. It made me question the strength of the author's sources.Either Rybczynski is to blame, or his editor. It's not anything that should prevent anyone from buying the book, but -- no matter how you slice it -- it's sloppy."
1,A disgrace of a biography,"This work, which preceded the outcry over ""Dutch,"" attracted scant attention for its overt use of fiction. Yet it is every bit as deceptive. I began skipping the (banal) fictional passages and still found the book a disappointment, with not nearly enough on the design and building of New York's Central Park."
2,DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY this is a waste of moneyit comes in a big as boxthe top is glued onit very god for pissin off ur parents sounds like bangin on a pani should of got an air hornthis message was aprove by bam mergera
4,Dual language version would be 5 stars!,I've enjoyed the stories I've read so far-- am saving most for when I am in Costa Rica. I just wish this were offered in a dual-langauge version.
3,Nice literary travel companion,"This enjoyable collection of short stories is a nice companion to any visit to Costa Rica. The stories are ""literary"" in nature...one shouldn't expect explorers crashing through rainforests chasing after ""savages"", nor anything related to 2012 doomsday prophecies or pyramid-top sacrifices.The stories do, however, provide a nice bit of color and flavor to each of Costa Rica's different regions. Visitors to the northwest province of Guanacaste will be a bit disappointed by only one story focused on that popular travel destination."
2,Not enjoying this.,"I probably should not have purchased it as I don't care for short stories, but I wanted to read something about Costa Rica. Authors from different parts of the country have been selected. I just don't care for the stories. Seem to leave one up in the air without conclusions. Probably just me. I will dutifully finish it."
3,"Not really a travel guide, but good background.","The short tories in this collection gave an artisitic picture from the native point of view - very simple, gentle, slow-paced, naive. I don't know if this is really true, but it helps me to look at the people in a different way when I go there."
1,very disappointing,"I liked the idea of this book. The first few stories had some boring parts, but hey they're short. Most of the stories were sad in one way or another, but hey, some people think that is literary I guess.Then at 21% is ""The Adventure"" by Samuel Rovinski which I found to be an unreadable rape fantasy. I suppose in a machismo country it isn't too surprising but this is not literature, it is violent pornography. I felt ambushed by this sudden departure from the previous tone.So between the fact there is wasn't a story so far that I loved and The Adventure, I really don't think I'll finish this collection and I really cannot recommend it."
1,Pure Spain: Flamenquito...Pure nonsense,I love Ottmar Liebert's music and thought that I would enjoy this CD. I did ot. Maybe it is just too authentic for my taste. I threw the CD in the trash!
4,"Very great adventure for young or old, strikes of Jack London","You can't read any of the books by Curwood and not think of London, it can't be helped, but this is one of Curwood's best stories and has a really fast pace compared to some of his other works.I would honestly say it is a very fast moving, page turner of a North Woods adventure book, and I enjoyed it as much as the young adults I read it to.If you ever dreamt of snowshoeing or canoeing into the vast wild lands of the north, building a cabin and living the forest life then this book will keep you riveted.If you like tales of Alaska, the Yukon and the heyday of the gold boom days of the Great White North then you will enjoy the Wolf Hunters, I am sure of it."
4,Need I say more,"I just finished this...it was just a really good, fast moving book. I finished it not 15 minutes ago, and came to look for more books by the author. I think that is a good sign of how much I liked it."
2,A Children s Book,"A bit corny, but not for my age group, a children's tale and nothing more. A bit out of touch with modern day thinking"
5,A pleasant enough story.... but oh so perfect!,"As with the other books in the series, this was a pleasant enough story for younger readers about a little girl growing up during America's past. But as with those other books, all of the conflicts are solved far too easily. The plot of this book is easily summed up. The setting is during the Great Depression. Kit and her two friends get into a fight at school with a mean classmate. Their punishment is delivering the class donations to the soup kitchen. There, Kit sees her father on the line for free food. She realizes how bad her family's situation is. Her father tells her he has to go away to find work. Kit finds a way to increase the income of the family's boardinghouse, and her father gets to stay. Lack of realism here, I'd say. If that was real life during the Depression, her dad probably would have had to leave. But I won't fault the publisher for toning down the harsher aspects of history - I read this series when I was as young as seven."
2,Service if threatened,"I ordered this book from Amazon.com on March 31 and received an email on April 3 that the book had been shipped. However, there was no sign of the book until May 2. I wrote back to the bookstore and told them that I would have no choice but to give them the lowest rating if they did not ship the book and lo behold - the store shipped the book on May 3."
1,GARBAGE,The outdoor unit does not work. It needs to be right next to the main unit to get a signal!!!!!
5,"Terrific value, great idea",Keeps accurate temperatures from all over the house. Base unit has room for additional units to get temperatures from various areas of your home. Also has a clock that calibrates using the atomic clock from Colorado so you know the time is exact. Price is outstanding.
5,"Great features, great price!","I just received the thermometer today and I'm very impressed. The particular model I received is the RMR112A and is silver, but otherwise looks identical to the one shown.Why did I give this 5 stars? Well, for $20, you get: 1) Atomic clock, 2) Indoor temperature, 3) Outdoor/remote wireless transmitter temperature.Unlike previous reviews, this model does not require a screwdriver to access the batteries for the base unit or the remote sensor.I do not live in an area where the temperature would be below -4 F (or if it is, not very long), so the temperature range is not an issue for me."
5,love it,"it is just cool to watch the temp going down to 4 degree F outside, while you can see your indoor temp at 72. you then apreciate your heating system.i use it to see how far can i use my new super efficient ductless minisplit electric heat pump."
3,Imperfect compromise,"I am going to quickly list the minuses of this unit:It is eating batteries like candy;It doesn't have night-light;Replacing the batteries on the remote unit is cumbersome;Does not display humidity.So, considering the discount, this is an imperfect compromise!Suggestions:Do something about the ease of changing the battery on the remote;Power the main unit to 110V, and keep the battery only for backup;Make it visible through the night;Display humidity (indoors and outdoors as well!).Then you price it for $34.95 and sell it like pancakes!"
3,"Good unit, but remote range is limited.","Unit had 2 minor flaws:A) When both remote and main units were placed side by side, they always displayed different temps., ususally less than 1 degree difference.B) Could not pick up signal from remote unit if it was more than 15' from main unit. The manual says it will work up to 100'. NOT EVEN CLOSE.Other than those issues unit is fine."
1,Outdoor temps way off,"Looks good, clock is dead on, inside temps is correct, but up to 21 degrees OFF the outside temp. Moved the outside sensor around the area, did not fix. Changed all batteries, did NOT fix. Fed up with it. Moving it all to trash. This is not the unit you want."
5,Great Car DVD,"I thought the DVD was really good. I think all the men should enjoy it! It has alot of nice cars, alot of girls. I think all the woman would like it if they are into nice cars. I like the part when they show the guys are their bikes doing some off the hook tricks! The music went with the flow of the DVD. I think the DVD was well put together. It represents NEW YORK to the fullest!The WIZARD did his thing! He is really funny, he made me laugh. Well GOOD LUCK and GOD BLESS!"
1,Dist Cap,"Well getting to the point on the Distributor cap, I was very disappointed to know while doing the job on my friends car, THE DISTRIBUTOR CAP is NOT! the correct one for this Vehicle and I gave all of the correct information, ALSO I was sent THE WRONG DIST. ROTOR"
3,Overpriced,This thing is extremely overpriced for what it does. The casing appears to be metallic but is actually plastic. There isn't an option to have the indiglo backlight to remain on when plugged into an electrical outlet. The analog time feature is more of a novelty. The atomic clock synchronization is VERY SLOW to respond. Most importantly the projection feature isn't able to be flipped or turned so one is limited in positioning the clock on the nightstand. Once positioned properly the projection feature makes glancing for the time very convenient when in bed. Other than that the only thing this clock has going for it is its compact design for business travelers and battery backup in case of electrical outages.
2,Better than nothing,"This projection clock is better than nothing. However, the projector is backwards in my opinion. If put on your headboard with the clock face facing outward, the projection on the ceiling will be backwards. That means, to have the projection facing right, the clock face must face the wall behind you. Also, if you want to display the time on the wall, you must lay the clock down on its side, the side that contains the AC adaptor plugin, which means if it's plugged in, the protrusion will prevent it from laying flat -- correctible if you have a hole in the tabletop (such as a cable guide, as I have). Overall, I'm disappointed at the misorientation of the projector and lack of positioning options. Having the projector orientated correctly with the clock face and having the projector on a swivel would correct all problems, but I haven't found such a product."
2,Disappointing,"Ceiling projection never worked very well, and synchronization with atomic clock was haphazard at best. After using this about one year, the projection numbers seem to be partially burned out. The only good thing is the design of the actual clock, which is attractive."
4,"Reasonably priced , fast shipment","This pump works well, reasonably priced. Only problem is the check valve is of poor quality. This item should be made of different quality material."
5,Great product,Very happy with the pump. It works great and arrived quickly. The price could not be beat. I would be very comfortable recommending it to friends.
4,Little Giant a Winner,"Item was shipped quickly, and installed easily in about 5 minutes. This is my 2nd one over the last 16 years. Will buy again."
5,condesation remval pump,Found this product to be very well priced and it was just what it showed to be on the webb. we are very satified and would use this site again the service was great thank you
2,No safety switch,"This model does NOT come with a safety switch (model#554405 apparently does). It does not mention this anywhere in the product description, nor does it mention this in the installation instructions. It took me a frustratingly long time to figure out that the switch was actually not there. Without the safety switch, this in NOT a good pump for a furnace. The pump I was replacing had the safety switch hooked up to the furnace to turn it off if the pump failed...avoiding a big pool of water on the floor. I never would have ordered this model had I known there was no safety switch."
2,Problem Pump,"I don't know if I did something wrong, but I am helpless with this pump. All the connections seem to be right, but the pump leaks, meaning, it doesn't turn itself on as fast as it should. I have been slow to react, but am getting tired with puddles in the basement. It seems that the only right way would have been to return it on time and get another one. I have had this for a month and a half."
3,no safety switch,"This is model VCMA-15UL, a better model is VCMA-15ULS, the S indicates a safety switch. On Amazon the VCMA-15ULS is also typically cheaper than the VCMA-15UL. All the other specs are identical."
3,Little Giant VCMA-15UL take care when ordering,"Model numbers confusing. I ordered wrong unit as I needed 220 volts, hooked up the ordered unit and quickly burned it up."
1,Little Giant Pump,What a disaster. I installed the pump and it ran backwards and could not be repaired. I had to call the plumber who said it was defective and replaced it. Unbelievable.
4,Good pump.,"Pump works great. It was a drop-in replacement for me, so there wasn't much to it.Plumbing Planet was great, ordered the pump Monday and it showed up Tuesday.My only complaint (4 vs. 5 stars) is that I would like an option for the typical Amazon Free Super Saving Shipping."
4,Great Price for Value,"This pump does not have an over full limiting switch. My old pump did have. I often needed to over ride that switch because it would shut down the Heat/Cool operation and demand my attention to operate normally.This pump will run as long as there is water enough to set the float to the on position. Now I just need to listen/watch that the pump dosen't get plugged, meaning I will need to hear it shut off in a normal cycle and see that it does not overflow. That can't be any more difficult than what I have been doing. Thanks for a good value."
4,better than the maps in my tourbooks,"I am using this map a lot- my friends say that I overthink things but I have 12 days on the ground to cram all that I can into- Not to mention covering LOTS of ground to cover. This map has been vital to planning my trip. I have not yet had the experience to tell you if it was accurate or not, but soon I will be able to tell you exactly how many miles are in an inch of this map.....and have photos of every one of them!"
4,A great help,Helped my husband study for his exam. A great tool to use to make the test easier. Thank you very much.
3,below average,This book is very inconsistent. If you are trying to get a class c license you should look else where. The book contains many formulas for higher classes but study another book that has more definitions in order to pass the license.
1,pretentious and dull,"I also picked this up at a book signing. Cool title, cool cover, but tediously over-written. The author seems to think that random sex scenes will spice up the action, but since most of the characters are unlikeable, even this drags."
2,Wood is too soft,"This cutting board is made of very soft, almost balsa-like wood. In a few short weeks mine has a chewed up surface and I doubt if it will last a year. I have to locate a cutting board made of rock maple, the good old fashioned mainstay of the meat cutting trade, with good reason. Save your money and avoid this cheapie."
1,FELL APART IMMEDIATELY,"I do NOT recommend this cutting board. My daughter washed it after the first use, and the board fell apart at the seams. I have NEVER had this happen with any other cutting board in 35 years."
5,Just the right size - and price!,"I have John Boos counter tops and additional large cutting boards, so I bought this small hardwood board to protect them when I cut onions and beets so that I wouldn't transfer onion to other foods or stain my good boards.The wood is indeed hardwood and stands up to the chef's knife. The grooves help keep the juice from running off and it is just the right size to easily handle when transferring cut veges to the cooking pot.It's a great bargain at $6.99 too! I think I'll buy another one so I have an extra for use on the other side of my kitchen and for those times when there are more than one cook in the kitchen.Love this board!"
2,cracked and is kind of small,My husband got this for me for Christmas....and I like it but it is small and cracked when sitting in water for an hour.
1,Awful Travel Clock,Avoid this travel clock. The clasp is so tight I had to struggle to open it. The night light beeps every time you activate it; can't be turned off. Just what I need when I wake up during the night and I want to see what time it is.Chucked it in the waste basket. Look elsewhere.
2,What alarm?!,"When I received this product in the mail, I was excited to have an easy to use travel alarm clock. However, when I tested the alarm, it wasn't any noisier than a pin dropping! Not too happy. I am returning the clock and hoping it was just a defect!"
1,Can't recommend: could be so much better,"The hinged cover has a lot of trouble staying open, it seems to be weighted wrong such that it tips over very easily (especially when snoozing the alarm!). This is probably the worst feature.I find the nightfinder feature useless. Perhaps other find it useful, but there's usually enough ambient light to at least find the alarm clock, should I need to know what time it is at 4am (a quick push back on the clock turns on the backlighting).It could be louder -- it usually wakes me up, but not reliably. It doesn't get louder at the end of its alarm sequence, just the beeps get more continuous.I also find it very easy to leave the clock in either the Alarm Set or Time Set (the toggle switch doesn't give you a good sense when it's in the middle), which means the alarm will never go off.Good things: it's light. Conservative with battery (assuming you don't accidentally turn on the nightfinder). Time is very visible and the backlighting is pleasant."
2,Not good for people with hearing deficiencies,"I bought this clock because it said it had a cresendo alarm...which is suppose to mean getting louder...however, the alarm does NOT get louder only faster. The size is convenient, and the night light is a good idea, but an alarm clock you can't hear is nothing more than another boat anchor."
1,Alarm Not Loud Enough,"As with other reviewers for this clock, I found the alarm not nearly loud enough. The only way I could hear it is if I was already awake, saw its light blinking and picked up the clock to hold it close to my ear. If I was asleep or facing away from the clock, I never heard it go off. Not very useful, even for a moderately light sleeper."
1,Terrible movie,"I rented this movie from Blockbuster, and I really wish I didn't. This is beyond a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. It has no recognizable plot. It is neither funny, nor scary. It is just pathetic. Please, don't rent this film, and do not buy it. I don't understand why Amazon even sells this.And for some reason after watching this movie, I feel depressed. I don't know if it was the dark lighting or the clown who sat in a dark room and talked to himself during the entire movie, but for some reason, this movie has really upset me, and I really wish I didn't watch it."
1,Rated by Dustin,This movie may seem like it is worth the money but belive me he only kills one person with the gun. If you had to ask me to by it and recive a million dollars I'd tell em that there crazy. If you don't want to belive me go rent the stinking movie then see what your mind tells you. I am 12 and I love horror but this is not even action. Dosen't come close to horror ethir so please people don't waste your money on a stupid film like this.
4,Verry accurate.,The small size is one of it's best features. The display switches from Time to Temp over and over. There's a switch to select indoor or outdoor temp. I put the outdoor wire outside my window screen. My only complaint is it can't be viewed when the lights are off. Wold be nice if the LCD was back-lit. A good product overall.
3,Thermometer,"I think this thermometer gives a some what accurate reading of the temperature, however when placing the sensor outside you need the thermometer clock near the window, throwing off the inside temperature as well."
5,Simple item / Simple Purchase - Or Scientific Clock,Ordered it and it came in on time and as stated. Works great! Simple product to use has what we wanted and the thermometer works great too. Highly recommended!
1,Won't do,The thermometer looks good and is easy to use. Unfortunately the temperature it gave was so inaccurate (more than two degrees off) that I had to return the product.
3,Strange Sounds,"This had such fantastic reviews and very few negative ones, so I purchased it to relax and unwind to. I think there was only one review, that I can remember saying that it sounded rather dirge like, and I thought, that's ok, a lot of new age music is kind of different.I gave it a fair chance, about 10 times. It is very strange sounding. Kind of like a halloween spooky, eerie sound. Not the soothing, healing music I expected.If you do not care about the weird beats and noises, then try it. Otherwise, skip it."
5,Real healing,"This music has physical healing power: I listened to it when I had severe back and shoulder pain, and the pain did reduce considerably! I also noticed that - surprisingly - my liver function improves and my skin becomes better each time after listening to the CD, not to mention the relaxing and calming power of the music. I like the CD a lot, and bought several copies for my Mom and other relatives. My Mom prefers Healing Mind System 2.0 which is easier on her.I also have other CDs by Dr Thompson (I prefer the alpha relaxation one)."
4,destress in just minutes,"Theta Meditation System: Let Go of Stress, Renew Your Spirit, Gain Insight, and IntuitionI recommend this product if you want to start meditating but don't know where to begin or just want to unwind after a stressful day. I use the cd every evening before sleeping and have noticed a huge improvement ini the quality of my sleep. I can go to sleep more readily and I have less trouble staying asleep. And added benefit for me has been increased weight loss. I'm not sure if this is a result of being less stressed or sleeping better at night. I would recomend these cd's to anyone who is dealing with stress, especially if stress is negatively impacting your life. I would also recommend these cd's if you are having difficulties with sleep. Personally I do not like to take medications and I find using these cds more helpful with my sleep problems than any medications I've tried and on the positive side they also have no harmful side effects."
5,Healing Mind,I feel that the Healing Mind System really helped some of my chronic health conditions. I listened to it while sleeping for a few weeks and I feel better. Mind over matter really does work and this CD helped me get there.
1,"Depressing; unsettling, disappointing.","I hope it's not me (obviously it must be), but I found this cd depressing and unsettling, leaving me in a somewhat agitated state - makes me wonder about my mind with the other 5 star reviews. I could NOT relax when listening to it and I listened to it 4 times in the hopes my mind would begin to accept it and relax. 1 star is the best I can do for this cd. I have not tried any of the others by Dr. Jeffrey Thompson, but am debating on it. I wish there were a way cds could be returned after opening them."
4,Very Relaxing CD,I really enjoy this CD. I'm a massage practitioner and even I get lulled by this CD whenever I play it for my clients. Very soothing sounds. I recommend purchasing it.
3,Not what I hoped for,"This Healing CD has a bit of a dirge sound, not very interesting compared to his CD ""Renew the MInd"" Perhaps I am unable to appreciate it properly as I'm not sick (thankfully)"
1,Simply Does not Work....,"The weather Forecaster is a joke, it has been displaying raining for the past 3 days, but it hasn't rain here in California for a while, and the weather forecast for next 5 days is ""SUNY""!Also the main unit can't display temperatures in Centigrades.And last but not least if you put the internal and external unit next to each other, you get different readings."
1,Centigrade trick,"Do not buy this if you are using Centigrade scale.I am not sure what designers of this device were thinking about!I got device with 1 main unit and 1 remote sensor unit.Remote sensor unit got Centigrade/Fahrenheit switch,but this unit going to be outdoor.Main unit, which you going to have on your table can showonly Fahrenheit scale and will override the display selectionmade on the remote sensor with Fahrenheit scale.Are you ready to go outdoor to your remote unit every timeyou want to know outdoor temperature in Centigrade?Want to see your indoor temperature in Centigrade?Sorry not possible!"
4,Very nice unit for the price,"I have paid this much ($29) separately for WWVB time-sync clock, thermometer/hygrometer and a remote temperature sensor. Here are all of these items in one package manufactured (well, imported) by a name brand company, Oregon Scientific. YMMV, but I laid the remote and indoor units on the table together and found a difference of 0.4 in temperature and 1% in humidity. I am considering buying two more units so that I can have all three remote channels populated and be able to view all three channels from multiple locations in my house. The only reason I witheld the 5th star in the rating, is that it would have been nice to view indoor and outdoor simultaneously, OR when in the scan mode if it would skip the ""dead"" channels instead of pausing on them for equal display time of ""---"" and ""--%""."
5,Very Nice Weather Station!,For the money (30 clams) this unit is exceptional. Read the other reviews for any feature limitations that might affect your situation (IMHO most are minor!) and then run (yes run!!) and purchase this unit. You'll enjoy it!!! This is not a toy; it's a scientific measurement device. Although it's not calibrated for lab environments it is more than accurate/stable enough for home use (1-2%). BTW - I recommend the use of lithium batteries in the remote unit. Lithiums function at greater temperature extremes than other batteries (e.g. alkalines are good only down to ~20 degree F.).
2,Okay for Toddlers But Not for Older Children,"I think they have the age range wrong for ""Another Important Book."" Rather than being for 4 to 8 year-olds, I think 3 and under might be more accurate.Certainly my children (3 and 5; boy and girl) had little interest in this book. They found the drawings too babyish and the content just did not spark any calls for another reading.Counting to 6? I've found my toes? Just all 'non-starters' for preschoolers and kindergarteners, unlike the original ""The Important Book"" which dealt with observations of the world around us.Two Stars (for the 3 and up age range). Check the images that Amazon has provided to decide on appropriateness for your child.For those interested in revisiting babyhood with older children we suggest Margaret Miller's ""Now I'm Big""."
3,Did not live up to my expectations.,The original Important Book is core literature in our district. Its an awesome book which lends itself to many different writing prompts. This was a nice book not an awesome one. Third Grade Teacher
4,My daughter loves this book!,"We received this book as a birthday gift. Although she is just 14 months old, my daughter adores this book -- especially the section on three-year-olds (The important thing about being three is ME!). She participates heartily. I highly recommend this book."
5,Never disappoints @}->---,"I love this guy. His voice is amazing and makes you weak at the knees. He keeps getting better and this is his 12 cd so imagine how good he's always been and now that he's here, it's that much better again. I love Soul Steppin and Superstar. He's obviously singing about himself, because in my mind he is a superstar. If you love sexy, romantic, bedroom music, then this is for you. What a voice."
4,A beautiful symphony indeed,"Will Downing has been doing his thing for a number of years now, and on each album, you were able to enjoy the way his tenor vocals glide along the nice lyrics. And his latest offering, Soul Symphony, continues that quality.This album has nine tracks, but it's over 40 minutes, so I don't know if you should call it an EP or a true CD, but at any rate, there are great songs like ""Put Me On"", ""A Promise"" and ""Make Time For Love"". And while some people may not like the uptempo ""Soul Steppin'"", I think it still works. The only song I didn't really care for was the corny ""Will Still Loves You"". And even though he did a great job on his remake of ""Superstar"", I'm starting to get tired of people covering that song. But Soul Symphony will still take you on a wonderful musical journey.Anthony Rupert"
4,Excellent recipes but Comercial quantities.,"The recipes in this book require substantial preparation but yield very tasty results. My one reservation is the enormous quantities each of the initial ""gateway"" or foundation recipes will yield. A great many of these will occupy pantry space for years in their reccomended volumes unless you have very frequent, very large, gatherings at your house. If mealtime is often on a commercial scale, this book is an excellent choice!"
5,The Glossaries and Ingredient descriptions are GREAT!!,"I've used many cookbooks, and most of them I photocopy my favorite recipes and then discard the book. I took this book in to photocopy it and ended up copying so much that I decided to buy the book!"
4,Buyer Beware!! FYI...,"If you are thinking about buying this CD single, be sure to check under IMPORTS first. This single is actually PART 1, it contains ""Disarm"" which alone, is reason enough to buy 5 copies... however, the ""B"" sides ""Soothe"" and ""Blew Away"" (by James Iha) are not mentioned above!! Shame on you Amazon! I personally prefer the ""B"" sides on PART 2 (Heart on cover) which are ""Landslide"" (an incredible cover of a Stevie Nicks masterpiece, which can also be found on ""Pisces Iscariot"") and ""Dancing in the Moonlight"" (a MUST if you like mellow Pumpkins). Due to Amazon's failure to list ""B"" sides, I am now the proud owner of both... but it was definately worth every penny!"
5,"Best Siamese Dream-era single, hands down.","This is quite an amazing single. I must say ""Disarm"" was the best single released off the Siamese Dream album. The B-sides here are quite nice. ""Soothe"" is very very soothing and ""Blew Away"" is a nice Iha song. You can find both of these on ""Pisces Iscariot"", however, which would be a better deal than hunting down this single. Unless of course you are a collector. Then it is a necessity."
5,Very Good.,"I have this CD and think that it is wonderful. Disarm has a great sound and is very soothing. Also, Landslide was originally by Stevie Nicks. BRAVO!"
4,Realistic,"This title is very realistic. Definetly not for gamers who love to run and gun. This game takes time and tactical efficiency to complete. You get to command 4 different teams throughout the game. Your teams consist of a machine-gun team, bazooka team , assualt team and base-of-fire team. You get control of an M4 Sherman in a couple of levels as well. Packed with alot of fun and historal information this title is a must buy.P.S. Be sure to use cover!!!"
4,a must have for FPS,"graphics are sub par, but gameplay is fun and commanding different squads with different abilities adds a really good dimension to the game that i have not seen in other games. overall thought the game was awesome especially for the price"
4,Great effects!,"The game is awesome, the visual effects blow me away. The only problem is that the default controls are a little hard to get used to."
4,"Excellent Graphics, good game play.","I happened to buy this game for Free, it went fast when it was a gold box deal for $10 & I happened to have a $10 gc, so I got this for free and I had the game before I bought my PS3. I've played it & it's got pretty good graphics, but the game play can be a little slow, but over all it's a pretty decent game. I love shopping on Amazon.com fast delievery & really good prices."
2,Worth a Rental,"Mixed bag, not as good as advertised, sloppy and linear. Textures not well done, more of last gen then next gen! Rent before you buy"
2,Mediocre at best,"Not only is the WWII genre game becoming a cliche, but this game makes it boring. It has very sluggish controls, bad voice acting, and tried too hard to be a video game version of Band of Brothers. It was worth one play through....maybe. Nothing more though."
3,Great first shooter game,"This game is really awesome, especially when you plays the history mode the main character involves you like the band of brothers series. My only negative comments is related to graphs, since they lack of high quality picture and even you play at 720 HD resolution. I expected more from the Ubisoft guys since I played the previous Brothers in Arms games in the past. However, the sound is really good and the game also has special scenes in low mode when you shoot to anyone in the head. In summary, I highly recommend BB Hell's Highway for those gamers that like World War II games with a drama history."
1,Frustrating,WAY too much micro-management. This would of been a better RTS game. Having to tell your squad to do everything kills the fun and is very boring. You spend most of the game trying to figure out all the command menus and sub menus and sub sub menus just to do a simple task. If you're lucky you might get to shoot something.
3,bros in arms,it was an ok game but i was used to playing newer games so the graphics werent that good to me still a good buy if that sort of thing doesnt bother you
4,Great Concept but not too much improvement over PS2 titles,I've played both PS2 titles of Brothers in Arms so I knew I had to check this game out. The graphics are a bit better than the PS2 versions but the gameplay is nearly identical. I hope they do better on any future releases. I do like this concept over the typical FPS. Actually controlling your men to work together to take out the enemy versus going in guns blazing.
3,A little too much drama,"I loved the old Brothers in Arms games and was hoping for more excellent squad controlling action. But this game goes a little too much into Goldeneye mode- you often find yourself seperated from your squad and doing missions alone. Not what I was looking for. There are some levels with tanks that are pretty fun, but again, there is no squad control for those ones.It also takes the whole story of the cursed handgun a little far and leads to long cut scenes. I would've rather had more action and game time than the convoluted cursd gun side story.Not great and not up to the past games, but not terrible if you can get it cheap."
5,"Terrific game, story and music","When I first got this game right after it came out, I hated the change in controls from the layout in the first 2 BIA games. But now, after playing it many times and having gotten used to the controls, I must say that it's one of my favorite games. I particularly like the opportunity to direct 2 fire teams while engaging the enemy myself. The game offers numerous opportunities to flank an enemy, and the AI is pretty good (though not outstanding).Graphics are not up to current standards, but game play and story are. And the music is terrific. I even bought the CD from Amazon just so I could enjoy it without the game. Anyone who enjoys WWII games with a genuine story should enjoy this game. I just wish the first 2 games (which were PS2) were re-released in PS3 versions, perhaps with upgraded graphics. They were a lot of fun."
5,Fantastic Game,"This is a fantastic game, at least it is now that it can be hard for around $15. The story is quite good as is the weapon selection. You as an individual soldier are also much more dangerous on your own than in past games. You get to do your fair share of shooting if you want. But this is still a tactical shooter and you aren't going to win without support and tactics. The game provides you a good training session when you start which it would behoove you to pay attention to. The difficulty goes way up not far into the campaign. You will have to learn how to use the assets you have, and lead the men who use them. I found it all to be quite fun and a lot different than the current gun and run FPS around. This isn't Call of Duty, Halo or Killzone by a large margin. But it sure is fun. If you are unsure give the demo on the Xbox or PS3 live and try it first. If you dig history at all and still enjoy a WW2 shooter, this is one that is hard to pass up on."
3,"3 stars and being generous, it didn't impress me",The storyline and offline missions of this game are not bad but this game just isn't enough to impress me these days. You know how when the PS3 was just released and none of the games were very impressive and didn't utilize the power of the PS3. Well this is one of those games. The graphics aren't bad but don't have the wow factor that makes you want to stand up and applaud. The artificial intelligence isn't great either. The environment isn't destructable and there are few things that you can blow up. The hit detection is absolutely absurd. It normally takes about 3 headshots to kill someone and 4 to 6 shots to kill someone if you hit them on the body. You can control your people and tell them which targets to engage and where to hide. However they seem to have a mind of their own and only listen to you about half of the time. The online mode wasn't very fun either compared to some of the other shooter games that are released.
1,Lost in no mans land,"Past games are purely Squad based. They worked flaw less. Now they want to be a FPS and well as a Squad game. With this mix up nothing works as it is supposed to be. The gameplay is totally lost in no mans land. I dont think they had a clear direction for this game. Flanking is all what the Squad will do, you have to run around do rambo. There is no clear clue on how to play this game.. where to do Rambo where to do use flanking. It is just trial and error. Pure waste of time and money.One main question why does this game look this worse ... it is supposed to be based on Unreal engine. I think they are using the same models from past PS2 games on the new engine. Trees and plans are just 2d card board cut out. All the cut scenes look awful."
1,Weak Sauce,"Graphics are so poor should be a PS2 game. While the combat system is good and makes good use of squad tactics the basic underlying game is weak. There is little use for fix and fire in the game as the maps are all narrow corridors. For a game that prides itself on maneuver warfare and flanking you have seldom times you can really go around. You have no way of telling which way you are being shot at from; coupled with the poor graphics and night battles are just frustrating.A BIG disappointment from the other BiA in the series, no improvement what so ever."
3,BBHH para pasar el tiempo esta bien,"Este juego esta bien para pasar el tiempo no es adictivo como COD4 ademas para que es eso de descubrir ""Kilroy was here"" no le veo la utilidad. Como me gustan los juegos de WWII lo compre, no es mala compra, lo recomiendo si te gustan esta clase de videojuegos."
5,good blues,good tunes . I have heard of him along time ago and just got around to buying one of his albums. Wish I had done it sooner.
5,SRV Real Deal: Greatest Hits1,"ANYTHING performed by Stevie is AWESOME. Texas blues by the best of the best is hard to not love. I implore anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of listening to SRV, do it and your toes will be a tapping while your ears will be flapin'!"
2,How to download?,How to download to an Android phone? Haven't figured it out yet. Who doesn't like Steve Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble.
1,Disappointing quality,Certainly does not sound digitally remastered. Disappointed with the quality. Do not buy. I have heard YouTube/pandora songs which are of much higher quality. Save your money.
4,good but with 12 mm holes,"Good belts at a great price ... my only criticism is that they come with 12mm bolts and 12mm holes in the brackets. That's probably fine for most applications but I had to find someone with the proper equipment to drill out the hardened-steel brackets so I could use 1/2"" bolts in my older American car."
1,Completely unsafe. Don't buy this.,"I bought this seatbelt to replace a middle seatbelt in the back seat of my Mitsubishi Montero. Installation wasn't too bad, but once it was installed, I buckled the belt and gave it a gentle pull - and the belt unlatched. I tried several times from different angles and it continued to pull apart with almost no resistance. Total failure I'd say."
4,Lots of fun,"Love my ipod even tho this model has now been discontinued (replaced by the nano).The only thing is I wish it came with the AC power adapter the regular ipod comes with and I wish there were a way to turn it off, otherwise it's awesome!"
4,Loving the Ipod mini,"The Ipod mini is great, I brought mine second hand!! Ive got the pink one, I think the colours awesome. Its got more than enough memory at 6GB. The battery life is ok, its more like 12 hours but its probably because mines a bit older. It does the job more than nicely for me. However it could be better. I like the extras, but it could have some more exciting games on it. They are pretty poor. It also could have an FM radio as sometimes I would like to change. Its easy to use and looks good so no other complaints. I recommend it!!!!"
1,iPod Mini,"Now that the nano is out, why buy this one? I was told that you cannot run with this iPod, although you can run with the nano. And since the prices are comparable, this one is obsolete."
5,Prayers that Avail Much,"Sometimes when I pray, I don't have the right words... but Prayers That Avail Much by Germaine Copeland has just the right words based on scripture for every situation. I refer to it daily, and my prayers are always answered according to God's will! It also makes a great gift! In fact, there really is no better gift. I recommend it!!!Prayers That Avail Much: Three Bestselling Works Complete in One Volume, 25th Anniversary Leather Burgundy (Commemorative Leather Edition)"
3,Hardcover is not the same size as original hardcover book,I was disappointed since this hardcover book andleather like bound is not the same book size orprint size as the original hardcover that I own.the print size is too small for me to read.I would have preferred if the size of the bookand an example of the print size could havebeen highlighted especially since it is notcomparable to the original hardcover book.
5,Great book,I love using this book in my daily time with the Lord. It has been THE biggest help I have ever read. I mark it up and make notes all the time.
4,Scripture based praying,"For those who want their spirit to connect with His Spiirit, this book works. God's Word is powerful. Use it in prayer."
5,Great book of everyday prayers,"This is a fantastic book of everyday, every situational prayers. To make it even better, they have them nicely indexed in the front so you can locate the exact prayer you need. Add the soft leather binding and the book just feels right in your hand.Absolutely a must have for you prayer warriors or anyone looking to expand their prayer library."
5,Prayers,This book is a must for all people who believe in the power of prayer. It covers all areas of concern. I strongly recommend!
1,The Prayer To Receive Jesus Is Unscriptural,"The chapter entitled ""Prayer to Receive Jesus"" is not found in scripture. No conversion example in the book of Acts or anywhere in the New Testament instructs or commands or shows that anyone who became a Christian ever prayed a prayer to ""receive Jesus."" Although prayer to call on the Lord was part of the baptismal experience in Acts 22:16, there is no evidence prayer alone was the point of salvation, and certainly the content of any such ""believers prayer"" or ""sinners prayer"" is not given in scripture. These prayer books by Ms. Copeland are clearly designed to advance an unbiblical evangelical Protestant agenda and human tradition in support of a false gospel. For this reason I must warn you not to buy this product."
3,Ok but not perfect,"My boyfriend bought this station in July just for FUN. First, I was like what.. [money] for a clock like this?? No way! But, I was wrong¡K after he explained everything¡K ¡This clock is a weather forecaster, you can get indoor/outdoor temperature and humidity from the senor and atomic clock, good for traveling¡ Overall, pretty accurate with the weather forecaster, about 70% correct, that¡s the manual said. And like others said that the atomic clock works excellent. Cons: should show the pressure in number, like 1003mb."
3,Not up to the job.,"While rated for indoor use, the specified humidity range extends down only to 25% RH, which is far from suitable for heated dwellings in cold weather. Surprising, because most other Oregon humidity sensors are rated down to 5% RH. I purchased two of the BTHR968 sensors for evaluation as well as several other Oregon sensors. Once the RH drops below about 20%, the displayed reading on one of the BTHR968 takes a nosedive to about 8%.The transmission frequency stability of both of the BTHR968 units is questionable. Although they both transmit data every 38 seconds (about 15 seconds apart) according to the LEDs on the units, the transmissions may not be received for over an hour at a time. Sometimes the data is received regularly from both units, sometimes from only one or the other, and sometimes from neither. Both of these are within 6 feet from the receiver. Transmissions from other Oregon sensors are received and only rarely miss a beat."
5,Special Effects: Atomic Pink,"Definitely the best pink hair dye that I've ever used. If you bleach your hair enough, you get exactly the color seen in the preview - bright neon pink! I need to restock soon!"
5,WOW,"Holy crap, this stuff's been in my hair for four and a half weeks and it's still the exact same color as when I put it in. Finally a hot pink dye that WORKS!"
5,Atomic!,I really love this product. The color is amazing and it lasts for a good while (2-3 weeks). Very easy to use.
2,I love the color but...,"This color was so bright and I loved it. But, It washed out a lot faster than I had anticipated and every time I showered it stained my shower bright pink. Also after the first two weeks it started to turn orange, I like orange just not in my hair."
5,Lasted about 6 months on me...,"I used this instead of a comparable Manic Panic colour because I was sick and tired of reapplying every week when it started to fade.Needless to say, after several months and darker dye jobs to ""cover up"" the pink, MY HAIR WAS STILL PINK! Amazing. It turned out to be cute and quirky but if it were green or a similar colour, I'd be upset.Definite 5 on staying power. Also, be sure to tarp your whole bathroom because this stuff will dye anything you so much as sneeze at."
4,.,Cheaper than the actual web site with great results as far as color turn out! was very please with promptness of arrival
4,Artful Review,"The book collects the strips and displays them harshly. Too small with poor quality, but here they are. (4 stars because it's the only thing out there)BUT...Spend $100- $200 and you can buy an original Star Hawks strip (!- this seemed unbelievable to me, but the price of Kane's strip art, apparently all done in markers, is much less than his comic book work).So save a little, buy a strip THEN buy this and you've got a nice item(s)."
4,excellent book !!,"This is a very well written book - clear, concise and great for revision and quick review. Unfortunately, it is quite a bit outdated and a revised edition never came out. I would urge the author or publisher to consider putting out a revised edition."
1,Are you nuts !!,"Unless I missed something in the description you would have to be to buy this. This item is avalable at your local hardware store for between 4.99 and 6.99. (same brand, same item code) I sell them from my service truck for 3.49 per tube and feel guilty. The product itself is great.The recommended item in the add (the grease gun) is for different cartriges as noted in one of the other reviews."
1,Read the FINE PRINT,"The product itself is just fine but I aquired it because I was buying a grease gun and they recommended purchasing the grease, too. When I got the products, the grease cartridges were not the same size for the gun I had bought."
4,branson B200 ultrasonic jewelry cleaner,"i have used this product once, & i am at this point happy that i bought it. i have a few minor beefs about the instructions, which do not specify whether the cleaning fluid that came with the cleaner is preferable to using some other fluid, what other fluids might be, what the consequences of spilling this fluid might be, how often one should change the fluid, etc. And then there are issues that arise from the desire to clean jewelry that is not composed of ""real"" metals. can these be mixed with others? these concerns aside, i enjoyed the process of using the actual cleaner, & was satisfied generally with how my jewelry emerged from the process of being cleaned. i have waited a long time to have clean earrings & rings!"
4,I'm freezing... I'm crying snow...,"Acquired this album in France last week. I was pleasantly surprised at how original most of the songs on here are. I had never heard of the artist Dionysos before, I had just heard ""Song for Jedi"" at a friends house and then got the album. Although there are very few lyrics in most of the songs (lots of repetition), the sound just.... works.If you don't know french you might be missing something here. Half of the songs are in english, but the lead singer's accent is painful to the ears. I actually wish it was all in French.If you can find it for a decent price, get it."
4,"dionysos,","it's a nice cd, the songs i loved as they are so lively and silly. you can make meaning to them. the words CAN be repetitive, it's pretty simple, but its not just mindless catchy ye-ye songs either, the tunes are alternately comlex and full.p.s. its not 'i love you so come to me and take of your clothes', its i love you, you're the sky of my heart so come to me and take off your clouds. and clouds sounds like clothes due to his accent. accident? i dont know.two of the really cool songs are dequise en pas moi and don diego 2000. they have themes actually, and the songs connect to older songs (liquid princess).. theyre playful but still somehow, deeper than just foolisheness. depends on what you read into it."
5,To have faith in Christ is to know who we are and who He is.,"It is as difficult to know who we are as to know who God is. A man is born to be proud, and this pride hinders him from knowing the living God and keeps him away from God's salvation. The book helps us turn away from our human pride and turn to the living God who is the very creator of the universe and who is also the savior Jesus Christ. The normal Christian faith is based on knowing who God is, and is experienced by dropping our human opinions and giving our hearts to Jesus Christ who is not only the incarnated God but also the salvation to those who need Him and want Him."
4,The Juice and Zest Book,The book is well written with enough information and guideline on various juices interm of their healing andvitality for the body. Not a dull book to read and reference to as it has sufficient colourful pictures andillustrations on various type of fruits that we don't even know by the actual name until now.As for the quality of the book is in good condition and satisfactory for a brand new copy. The shipment ison time as stated in the order and well handled.Thank you.
1,It quit,This was a replacement for the first one that failed. My husband now uses a plastic cup to measure the rainfall.
4,Oregon Weather Rain gage,Product came in box badly beat up but merchandise was in great shape.good service and great product condition.
3,they're okay,"I bought these and decided to return them. I think it's hard to buy jewelry online, but they weren't the color I was expecting and mostly I decided they just didn't look good on me. After seeing someone at a wedding wearing real, beautiful black pearls I really wanted my own without spending thousands of dollars, but I didn't think they looked real. Even though you're provided a picture of the clasp, I think they could have used a more decorative/prettier clasp."
3,Clasp is lacking,"The necklace is pretty and looks good (my wife was thrilled with it); however the clasp is thoroughly lacking. In only one day of wear it released itself three separate times, and we only continue to own the necklace because it is heavy enough that she noticed when it started to slip off - otherwise it would be on the ground somewhere. The 'pearls' are heavier than I thought they would be and the tiny little hook provided just isn't up to the task."
5,"whirling information,","The history of these lands is so complex that his book are a welcome sigh of relief: he writes clearly and shows the origins of the going ons. Learning the whys and hows of the development of that history DEFINITIVELY make you re-evaluate your attitudes toward many figureheads. The massive crossover of disciplines (intellectuals of all fields) that shaped the ideological/political developments of these lands (and eventually of the modern world) are bewildering. Any reader will be amazed to find out the interests/implications of freemason societies, media and government agents that took active roles."
1,Terrible Stroller,"This stroller is terrible! You cannot turn this stroller without either skidding the back wheels in the opposite direction you want to turn or if you are lucky, have the person with you lift up the fron end and have them turn the stroller for you. I have a newborn and a 26 month old. You cannot turn this stroller at all. The tandem aspect of the stroller is nice but if you can't move the stroller, what's the point? I am sure you can find a better stroller than this one!"
2,Heavy and hard to steer...,I have this stroller and have only used it twice because it is very heavy and hard to steer. I would not recommend this for a someone who will be traveling alone with kids.
1,tall skinny book difficult to use; disappointing,"I should have read the description more closely. It is 96 pages including index, etc. It is taller than Joy of Cooking but as skinny as the free blooklet you get when you buy a slow cooker, making it difficult to handle. The recipies look OK, nothing caught my fancy, but this book was NOT worth the money to buy. I have the Better Homes and Garden crocery cooker book and it is great. Perhaps as a first book it would be OK."
2,Not what it's crocked up to be,"I wasn't impressed with this cookbook. That surprises me since I usually trust and rely on Betty Crocker cookbooks. This one gave many tasty and appealing recipes. Only problem was that they were very unusual. Not your typical selection of ingredients and taste combinations. I was hoping for everyday things you want to cook and being able to use the crock pot for it such as: Beef Stew, Chicken Soup, Chowder, Chili, Roasted Chicken, Pot Roast, Pork Roast, Baked Beans, Pea Soup, American Chop Suey (ground beef, macaroni, tomato sauce), various casseroles, etc. I have had the book for over a month and have not used one recipe and I don't plan on it."
3,Cooking from Betty Crocker's Slow-cooker Recipes,"This is a good book for a beginner. I found some useful information, but I would have liked more recipes for the experienced cook."
3,Hey look! A pair of reviews!!!,"First off I would like to start with the positive side of the review. I must admit that the look of the QX-900 is quite nice, and it's size is perfect. The time taken to ship was good, came in a good condition, and was properly packaged.Now I only have two negative things to be said about Pure Acoustics, and there product. The title says (Black, PAIR) and I only received 1. Apparently it means that PA is not selling a ""pair,"" but rather just displaying that these are MEANT to be a ""pair."" I'm not really mad considering the price. I do have a pair now after given a replacement, and not understanding that this was a whole other purchase and not a fulfillment of the original purchase. So with that being said, I can give an accurate review of a pair of QX-900's sound quality. In comparison to my 1985 floor-standing JBL speakers (PAIR), not worth it."
4,So far works great!,"We just started this but my son seems to be doing well. We can just measure it out and put it on a spoon. We don't have to mix it with anything. A lot cheaper here on Amazon from Vitamin Shoppe than on their own website which I thought was odd. The only complaint is when you use their dropper at the beginning, it seems to overflow easily and make a mess. Other than that, it seems great. We will definitely get this again when we need to."
3,missing alot of important vitamins,"the taste is ok;but this vitamin is missing alot of important vitamins such as calcium,folic acid etc...i'm very disappointed in that matter..."
5,Great!,"I bought this stuff for my daughter, and she loved it. I just mixed it with her goats milk and its been great. All natural is what I love!"
1,Solar address light,"It does not light very brightly, however, it is easy enough to see in the dark. That is until the switch that turns it on when the light fades broke. Now it doesn't light at all unless I tap on it. It took about 3 month's for it to break."
2,skippeer,this address sign is the biggest we have purchased and hoped it would be easy to see. the problem is it wont stay on more than a few hours at night after a sunny day. if it was cloudy it doesnt come on at all. the way you attach the numbers is very flimsy and they warp some in the case with temperature changes. the outside case itself is sturdy and looks better than several we have seen. the detachable solar collector is a nice feature but we never used it. it may just have bad batteries so we will change them and see what happens but they came wrapped in a separate package so i doubt that is the problem.its too bad it didnt work as we bought it for my wifes 85 year old mother.
4,A good product.,This purchase was replacement for the same purchased over five years ago. The old one performed well on the South side of our house and hopefully the new one will be as durable. We were pleased enough to search for a like replacement.
