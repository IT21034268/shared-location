3,definitely missing stuff but fun to listen to,"my friend and i saw this movie and wanted to buy the soundtrack immediately! i bought it in the store for almost $20 and was disappointed that there were so few songs on it, at least here on amazon it's cheaper so more worth it. there were definitely songs that should have been included that were missing, not sure how they can justify charging $20 for 13 songs these days. still it's a fun CD and great for summer. i'd recommend gettin a used copy since you'll end up wanting to download the missing songs ;)"
3,To bad...,"The movie is awsome but i dont understand why the best songs are not featured and instead they feature some dumb tracks that you never heard during the movie. Anyway after some time searching the net i have found the name of the track thas plays when Lucy is painting. Its not 311, its ""Beach Boys - Wouldnt it be nice"". Hope that this helps you all :)"
3,What? It's not on there?,I just saw this fantastic movie and I am so shocked that many of the songs I thought were the best do not appear on the CD. I am equally surprised to see songs I hadn't even noticed in the movie!
2,The Only Good Song Is Love Song By 311,"Why do all soundtracks have to be crappy? The movie was alright, the sountrack is really missing something. i suggest to download love song by 311."
4,Loved It!,Hey does anyone know who did that version of Over the Rainbow that is at the end of the movie? It was also on ER when Dr. Green died. I love the song and i want to find a copy of it.
2,Movie is Great Now where is the music,"I was so excited to buy the soundtrack after I went and saw the movie then I listened.. Sad Day.. The actual movie plays some of the greatest music I have ever listened too. So you can imagine my disgrace when I bought the Soundtrack. There is a song in the movie that I really want to know who sings it. It is not on the Soundtrack it starts by saying ""Whoa everett is the color of your energy or something like that"" if you know who this is email me reed_077@yahoo.com thank you... Don't rush to buy this soundtrack you will be disappointed"
2,Something's Missing,"Add me to the disappointed list. ""True"", by Will-I-Am featuring Fergie, isn't on the CD. I noticed a few more missing from the disc, but ""True"" was the reason I purchased the CD. The two tracks that I do enjoy isn't worth the money I spent on it."
2,Where are the other songs?!?!?,"I have to agree with Patrick....while the songs are mostly good, I am very VERY upset that some songs were left out of the soundtrack. ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" was one of the themes to the whole movie. Also, the song ""Amber"" by 311 is really good, and was neglected in the soundtrack. I am extremely upset about this, since I bought the soundtrack expecting these songs to be on there. I mean, honestly...how can they not have ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" on there? Its ridiculous...especially when they put songs that were very small or nonexistent on it. I am not happy with this soundtrack at all!!"
1,Big disapointment,"I wanted this CD as my Christmas gift and when I found that that the song ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" was not included I was really angry. I wanted the CD for this song basically... Big, big disapointment!!!"
3,where is the friggin Rainbow,The one and only reason why I purchased the CD was that particular version of Over the Rainbow that does not remind me of the OZ. Let down buy a sountrack again!!!!
3,iIT LACKED,IT LACKED THE BEST SONG OF ALL. (IZ'S VERSION OF SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW) IT WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL RE-MAKE. IT SHOULD HAVE MADE IT INTO THE SOUNDTRACK.
3,Not Quite There,"In agreement with most of the other reviewers, its very frustrating when you see a movie with great music in it (such as this one) and you rush out and buy the soundtrack and find half of the songs you want are missing! I can understand the soundtrack executive's motive....all the songs on this CD are in the same category...all 80's covers done reggae. Great! Now why not release a second soundtrack with all the songs that were missed the first time...such as Wouldn't It Be Nice and Somewhere Over the Rainbow. Good songs...can't give it 5 stars since it's incomplete."
3,Blinded by the light song,"hi! i just wanted to answer your question. the song is "" blinded by the light "" by manfred or something like that.. hope that was helpfull!"
3,50 First Dates...,"Finally listened to the CD and I have to say it was a tad bit disappointing. Aside from the missing ""Over the Rainbow"" song, it lacked the only other song I had hoped would be on it....the song that plays in the diner parking lot after Lucy and Henry first meet at the diner....they're each doing a little dance. Does anyone have any idea what that song is??"
4,50 First Dates,This CD reminds me of being on the beach - lots of 80's tunes infused with reggae beats.
1,50 First Dates Sound Track,"It was really a poor representation of the music and did not include ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" which was the best music in the movie."
4,Song from Movie,"Jack Meggitt (Roseville, Minnesota United States) wrote ----I CANNOT BELIEVE OTHER THEN ME THAT NO ONE HAS NOTICED THE BEST SONG MISSING FROM THE SOUNDTRACK. IF YOU WATCH THE PREVIEW CLIP ON YAHOO MOVIES TITLED ""BEE ON ME"" THERE IS AN AMAZING SONG PLAYING. DREW AND ADAM START DANCING IN HAPPINESS TO CELEBRATE THEIR SCHEDULED BREAKFAST FOR THE NEXT DAY. IT SOUNDS ALMOST LIKE AN ENYA SONG, BUT I'M NOT SURE. PLEASE ANYONE WITH THE NAME OF THE SONG OR ARTIST I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT.I haven't seen anyone list the name or artist for this song. Can someone please help me out. I would really appreciate it."
2,Not all songs from the movie.,"When I ordered this product, I expected to hear all the songs from the movie, but it was more of a regae soundtrack. The only song I really liked was ""Love Song"" by 311."
3,Your Answer,"The song you guys are looking for is called ""Amber"" by 311. Here is the lyrics:BrainstormTake me away from the normI've got to tell you something..This phenomenonI had to put it in a song,and it goes like:WhoaAmber is the color of your energyWhoaShades of gold displayed naturallyYou ought to know what brings me hereYou glide through my head blind to fear,and I know why-WhoaAmber is the color of your energyWhoaShades of gold displayed naturallyWhoaAmber is the color of your energyWhoaShades of gold displayed naturallyYou live too far awayYour voice rings like a bell anywayDon't give up your independenceunless it feels so rightNothing good comes easily;Sometimes you've got to fightWhoaAmber is the color of your energyWhoaShades of gold displayed naturallyLaunched a thousand ships in my heart, so easyStill, it's fine from afar, and you know thatWhoaBrainstormTake me away from the normWhoaI've got to tell you something"
1,completely disappointed,"This is the worst soundtrack ever. I don't know why every song has to be reggae. I wish they could have done this album with these songs, but not make them reggae. Terrible! I wasted my money on this one."
3,what is with adam sandler and drew berry more with the 80s?,I know that Drew and adam both grew up in the 80'sI liked the wedding singer and it's sound trackbut this is just too much!they really should have come out with a better sound trackI only saw the movie cus it had sean astin in itI thought it sucked...BOOO!
1,"no pot of gold due to no ""over the rainbow""","I was expecting that Iz's ""over the rainbow"" would be included and therefore i can only rate one star - the inclusion of that track would have merited 5 stars!! very dissapointed!! i felt cheated!"
2,Crap,"It's got a few ok songs on it, but seriously, I wanted to hear the beach boys' ""Wouldn't it be nice"" and the awesome ""Over the Rainbow"" that closed the movie. Neither are on the cd, and I'm pretty sad about that."
4,Great CD but missing best song,"I agree with the other reviews that this CD is missing the best song from the movie soundtrack. I do not know who made the decision but it is a very big disappointment to pop in this otherwise outstanding CD knowing that ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" is not included. All tracks are fresh and I enjoy listening to it almost daily."
1,Thanks to Sara Core!,"I have been looking all over to find out two of these songs (Baby by Wyclef & Over the Rainbow by IZ) that is not on the soundtrack and thanks!!Baby by Wyclef I also heard on the two part season finale of 3rd Watch and Over the Rainbow by IZ on ER finale ""On the Beach"" when Dr. Green died.A lot of soundtracks do this not including all of the songs from the movie...they seem to not know really what ""sounds"" the viewers fell in love with as they watched."
3,So Sad Such great Songs are Missing!!!!,"One of the things that immpressed me the most about the movie was the song slection.I WAS going to buy this soundtrack until my friend played it for me... All I kept saying was ""did you skip over some songs?"" And when she said no and showed me the case I was SOOO dissapointed!!!There are at least five or six (maybe even more) missing songs that were my whole reason for wanting to buy the soundtack after seeing the movie!!!I mean, when I thought of getting all those great songs on one disk and being reminded of how great the movie was everytime I listened to them I was SO excited then I found out only half the soundtrack was on the disk... POOR!But I do really like the songs that did make it to the disk... so that's why I went ahead and gave it three stars"
3,"It's not the ""real"" movie soundtrack","This only covers the love songs out of the movie, and is missing the most important one out of the movie by the Beach Boys! You have to like reggae and a little rap. It would be a great CD to listen to on a beach somewhere."
2,where are the songs?,"So I think as you can all tell, this CD is annoying because it's missing so many of the wonderful songs that are actually in the movie. And by the way, that last song on the boat in Alaska is a version of ""Over the Rainbow"" performed by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole, an artist often referred to only as IZ. You can find him in the international section of a lot of CD stores, or probably here on our very own Amazon."
4,In agreement with big boy!,"I have yet to see the movie, but after hearing a couple of the track on the radio I started to look into getting the disc. I read all of the reviews and the recurring negative is that it doesnt sound like the original. It doesnt, it wont. It was not produced as a tribute CD, it is a COVER disc where many different bands take the songs and ""tweak"" them. This disc followed a Reggae theme to fit the movie. I love. Bottom line is that if you are looking for the original by Spandau Ballet, The Cure or The Police, that is what you need to be looking at, not any type of a cover disc."
3,Paul McCartney Song...,"Does anyone know the title of the Paul McCartney song in the movie? is it ""Just another Day?""...I wish they would have put that on the sound track too."
3,I need the entire Music Compilation,I to would like to know the complete soundtrack. I'm just glad I didn't buy the soundtrack yet. Not that it's bad but just incomplete.
3,Beach Boys,Hehmm... why is the beach boys's song is not included in the cd? Can anyone tell me what is the title of the song? The one that Adam Sandler sing as he start journey and also the one that Drew sing as she paint the garage? Thanks a bunch... :)
1,Music,"I canceled one order for this product after being asked for my routing number. I found 2nd order for 99cents and it arrived fine. Later, the first CD that I canceled was sent and $$ taken from my account. Not pleased with foreign order!!~"
1,Don't Bother,"If you loved this moved as much as I did, there were two songs that stand out and take you back to the movie: ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"", by the Beach Boys and ""Over the Rainbow"", by Israel Kamakawiwoole. Neither of these titles is on the CD. Instead there is music that you've probably never heard before or want to hear again...with the exception of Adam Sandler's cute little ditty,""Forgetful Lucy""...the only reason I gave it even one star."
1,Help!,I think there was another song from Shania Twain during one of their encounters in the breakfast place. Can anyone tell me the name of the song and I might got the artist wrong.
4,This CD is Great,"I love the Island feel of the music on this CD. The remixes are great...except for one. The Will.I.Am and Fergie rendition of ""TRUE"" sux. There is a great female vocal line, and then this dude comes in and starts rapping...what a shame.Other than that its great. The 311 version of ""LOVE SONG"" and UB40s cover of The Police are awesome. I recommend this to anyone who like Reggae or 80s tunes."
3,Anyone know the complete list of songs in the movie?,"The soundtrack in the movie is awesome, but the cd only has a few of these songs, and not the best ones either. Can anyone tell me where to find a complete list of the musical credits? I would like to make my own sountrack cd that has all the songs, not just the one they're jamming us with."
3,Car ride song,"The song from the car ride with Lucy's dad is by The Flaming Lips, called ""Do You Realize""."
3,"Where to find ""Over The Rainbow""","If anyone's interested, I believe the version of ""Over the Rainbow"" that was in the last scene, and is missing from this soundtrack was also on the ""Meet Joe Black"" soundtrack."
3,Name of that song?,"There's a song that plays in the movie and also on the preview. The main lyrics you are "" oh oh amber is the color of your energy "" who sings that song if you know please post it."
3,Over the rainbow-What a wounderful world,Iarial Kamakawiwo's Night dose a kick ass job on his verison of Over the rainbow. Everyone you can find that on these Cds at Tower Records.comThe greatest songs ever- use Kamakawio to pull it upMeet Joe Black-sound trackand Iarial Kamakawiwo's own Cd Facing the Furture.I hope everyone finds it cause it is a great song...
2,IZ is missing!!!!,"My husband and I were so disappointed to realize (once we had purchased the CD) that the infamous song ""Over the Rainbow"" was missing from the soundtrack. Such a beautiful and important song and it wasn't included.Just a word of caution - if you love the song, it won't be on this CD. The graphics and wording that Amazon is providing is slightly misleading."
3,"No ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow...""","I loved this movie. I bought this cd thinking it had ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World"" (by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole) on it as I saw it listed as such. It didn't and I had to order it elsewhere. If you buy this, be aware it doesn't have every song from the movie on it. It's a sweet, easy, fun set of 80's love songs though."
3,Album would be better with these songs!,"The album has some really great covers especially Slave to Love and Hold Me Now but....All those ""missing"" songs featured in the movie but not on the soundtrack CD are really awesome too! So here's a list of the songs everyone has been looking for:1. Wouldn't It Be Nice by The Beach Boys (sung by Lucy)2. Another Day by Wings aka Paul McCartney3. Amber by 311 (""..Color of Your Energy.."")4. Baby by Wyclef (during makeout in the office)5. Blinded by the Light by Manfred Mann (first look at Lucy)6. Do You Realize by Flaming Lips (Lucy's car accident)7. Could You be Loved by Bob Marley (trailer)8. Hey Yah by Outkast (trailer)9. Somewhere Over the Rainbow by IZ (end song)"
3,Which songs are missing?,"Great movie! Sadly, the two songs missing from this soundtrack that most people will want are:""Amber"" by 311 which is on their June 2001 CD release ""From Chaos"".""Somewhere Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World "" by Israel ""Brudda Iz"" Kamakawiwo`ole from his September 1993 release ""Facing Future"". The song has been featured in several other movies including ""Meet Joe Black"", where it also runs at the end of the movie, in this case with the credits. It was also used as a popular theme in the now long defuct etoys.com's commercials."
3,Missing songs from soundtrack,"It's a shame 50 First Dates sound track doesn't have the beautiful song the movie closes with.To listen to Isreal Kamamawiwo'ole's version of Somewhere over the Rainbow open the following link with Windows Media Player.(...)It's true, this song is also on the Meet Joe Black soundtrack."
3,Missing Artists from Soundtrack,"After seeing this film today, I thought that the soundtrack would be quite good, but after looking at the artists on the soundtrack avaiable it appears that most of the best songs in the film are missing. For example, No Doubt's ""Underneath it All"". This song took up quite a chunk of a couple of scenes but doesn't appear to have made it to the soundtrack album. Quite a disappointing soundtrack."
3,Trailer Music answer,"The trailer songs used in 50 First Dates were:""Amber"" - 311""Blinded by the Light"" - Manfred Mann""Could You Be Loved"" - Bob Marley""Hey Yeah"" - OutkastGet the songs titles for almost all trailers from:http://www.soundtrack.net/trailers/"
3,Songs missing,"Being a Beatles' fan - always looking for the Beatles' connection, I noticed that Paul McCartney's ""Another Day"" is missing.Also there's a track that Ringo plays drums which I didn't catch the name of - I'm not sure if it's on the CD. Movie is really funny and in context, the Adam Sandler song belongs on the CD. I own both Wedding Singer CDs."
3,Nice Complement,"Given that a previous reviewer is a self-proclaimed Beach Boys fan (and somehow doesn't have one of their major songs already in his/her collection and is looking for it on a soundtrack?), I think a more unbiased review is in order. The entire album (sans the one Sandler did) is of cover songs, all with a sort of tropical twist on them. It's fitting for two reasons- The MOVIE takes place in Hawaii, hence the tropical renditions, and the theme of the movie (in a way) is about falling in love for the first time over and over again. Just like Lucy in the movie is redoing the same day over and over again in a slightly different way, each song on the soundtrack is being redone in a slightly different way. I dunno, maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I think the soundtrack is a nice complement to the movie. I also think that the Sandler song at the end is what any true Adam Sandler fan would appreciate. This album would be a fun and different addition to any musical collection."
1,Disappointment!,This CD is missing some good songs that were in the movie! Don't even bother buying it...
3,Bruddah Iz isn't there,"Hi, Madison. I wondered about it too as I was sure I'd heard it recently in another movie.It's by Bruddah Iz, a Hawaiian singer now dead. The other movie was ""The Big Bounce"" which I'd seen excerpts of on HBO's The Making of ""The Big Bounce"".A Google search of ""somewhere over the rainbow"" ""50 first dates"" finds a Honolulu Advertiser article with lots of background."
1,Don't buy this CD,"This is not a music CD! I bought this thing expecting the great tunes from the movie. But, there are no songs on it!! All it has is extra features, like the movie trailer, some behind-the-scenes features, screen savers, etc. WTF?! I am not happy with this at all!!"
2,50 first dates soundtrack,"Kind of disappointed with this cd. Some of the great songs that were in the movie aren't on here, and some of the songs on here I don't recognize at all."
1,Where are the good songs!!!,"Dissapointing Soundtrack. All the songs in the movie are great but they are not in the CD. They forgot to add the good ones. I was ready to buy it until I realized that ""Amber"" or ""Over the Rainbow"", etc... were not there."
3,Somewhere Over the Rainbow Missing :-(,Luckily you can download IZ's Somewhere Over the Rainbow from ITunes for 99 cents. I LOVE THAT SONG!
1,A soundtrack without the soundtracks,This is NOT worth the money. its a soundtrack that's missing so many of the songs its not worth getting. dont' waste your money
4,it's all about expectations,"I bought this album expecting some interesting island-beat interpretations of 80's music, and that's exactly what I got. I think it's fresh and I especially like the UB40 cut of ""Every Breath You Take"". If you're looking for something new with familiar lyrics, that's what you'll get here. If you're looking for something mainstream, look elsewhere."
4,Great Motion Picture SOUNDTRACK!,I`m writing this review just to make a point here to all the negative reviews sorry if this has been told already I can`t bother reading 247 reviews one by one at this moment.This soundtrack is really nice and is intended as a release of 80`s music with an island tropical twist.This soundtrack DOES NOT reflects the original score of the movie which features great songs not included in this soundtrack.There is a difference between a Soundtrack and the Original Score people!!If you guys want the original score well download the list kindly provided by the person who wrote the first review for this soundtrack.
3,Sorry excuse for a soundtrack,"Sorry, but I have to give this sdtk a 3. I hate to do it, but how can they put out this sdtk without ""Amber"" by 311? On the DVD they have the video for crying out loud but the song isn't on the sdtk? What sense does that make? Thank you to lizabeth83 for sharing the complete listing of songs. I am going to be one of the ones making my own sdtk."
2,sort of kind of disappoint in it really probably but I doudt it,"mixed bag on this one. so far its dissappointing...ya, I know, how can I say that.....but I'm saying that....maybe if I listen to it some more........but is just didn't grab me the way I thought it would....this one goes to the dusty CD pile.....but I have had CDs come out of the Dust pile and become favorites later on........werid, freaky.....but that's music, that's rock and roll, that's how it goes...and don't tell me the same thing isn't going on with you.........."
1,Thank you for IZ!,"Thank you! Thank you! to the 2 reviewers who named IZ as the amazing voice of the haunting rendition of 'Over the Rainbow' that I first heard on ER last year. I was never able to track down the artist. I was delighted to hear that this song was in this film, however, to my dismay, this track is not on the soundtrack. So now I am going to purchase one of IZ albums rather that the soundtrack."
4,I love this movie and great soundtrack!,"I purchased this soundtrack because I LOVE this movie so much. It makes me miss home ""Honolulu."" Its a great soundtrack to listen to when you're on a road trip."
1,don't believe everything you read,"Although this is a lovely CD, it does not have on it the music that touched my heart Somewhere over the rainbow and What a wonderful world....so therefore it is not the full soundtrack..... someone duped me! Now i had to go and spend $27.00 plus to order a CD with those songs on it...This teaches me to listen to the CD before buying it......."
1,None of the good songs,Bought this as a gift for my wife because she loved the songs from the movie. Problem is none of the good songs are on it. she never listens to it. Read the short list of songs before you buy to make sure you like them.
4,I like the Pacific tracks,There are some tracks with a fun Pacific Islander beat. It's relaxing to listen to.
2,50 First Dates CD,"Did not enjoy this CD, there was the ""wouldn't it be nice"" that was all through the movie and seemed to be what the movie centered around that wasn't even on it. Some of the music I didn't even hear on the movie."
3,Where Are the Boys?,"Okay, I've got to say. I loved the movie, loved all of the songs in it too. The covers, I personally felt, were pretty well done. My only complaint is that I would have loved to have had two more songs on it: The one that plays while they get everything ready for Lucy at night, and of course, The Beach Boys one! Seriously, that song was a part of the plot. How did that not make it to the soundtrack? Anyway, it's not quite complete, but other than that, it's a pretty good soundtrack. Nice mellow songs."
3,question,"what's the song that plays when drew barrymore is in the car with her dad (preaccident)... it's like 'do you realize... you have the most beautiful eyes.."" this is really bothering me. thanks."
4,Error in Credits,"""Breakfast in Bed"" was *not* by UB40, but instead was just another cover (like UB40 every wrote anything good themselves? C'mon).Breakfast In Bed(Eddie Hinton, Donnie Fritts)Popularized by R&B legend Baby Washington and covered by Dusty Springfield on the album, 'Dusty In Memphis' in 1969 before Lorna Bennett turned out the first reggae version in '72 produced by Harry J. Dj version Skank In Bed by Scotty and African Breakfast (In Bed) by Bongo Herman & the Harry J All Stars both produced by Harry J in 1972. A hit for UB40 (featuring Chrissie Hynde) in June 1988."
2,Good for a bodybuilding collector not for someone looking to make gains in 2008,A good bodybuilding collectable. The advice in here is about 25 years out of date though.
4,A different sort of telling to the story. . .,"I think that many people would like to hold on to Robin Hood as the outstanding archer he is portrayed as in many accounts. McKinley's telling of the story is well-written, but there is want for heroism in its main character. This Robin is less of the strong main character he should be. Despite this, the book is enjoyable, and I do like that she keeps him human."
3,Retelling of the age-old tale of Robin Hood,"Though not the greatest retelling of the legend of Robin Hood, McKinley weaves an entralling tale thats keeps the reader entertained until the end. McKinley's main weakness in all her storys, not just The Outlaws of Sherwood, is the endings.The characters of Robin Hood and Maid Marian are refreshingly original while the Sheriff of Nottingham is still stereotypically evil. One notably absent character from legend is Prince John.Forced into the forest by unfair laws, the outlaws unite to fight against the Sheriff of Nottingham. The story sticks to legend until the ending.This novel is not one of McKinley's best but is a light, enjoyable read."
4,A different angle on a well-known tale,It had a slow beginning for me but then got more and more exciting. By the end of the book I could hardly put it down. I had to remind myself to put aside comparisons of other images from movies and imagine Mckinley's storyline & characters apart from that. I found it had a very realistic portyal of the lives of Outlaws and I could easily feel & even smell Sherwood forrest. Lady Marion has a surprisingly heroic role. It was enjoyable and a great escape.
3,Good effort,"I bought this book after reading the other reviews, hoping it was the sort of Robin Hood book I was looking for. It was and it wasn't. The writing is good, and the character of Robin is likeable, a humble leader who admits that he can't shoot as well as he is thought to be able to, and things like that. What I didn't really care for was that the author tended to focus on a relationship between a female outlaw and Little John. Other than that, a pretty decent book."
3,Not Quite a Hero,"While I've read and loved the majority of McKinley's work, I was disappointed by The Outlaws of Sherwood... The heroines of her other works - Aerin, Harry, Beauty, Lisla Lissar - are incredibly strong characters, believable, intelligent, wry, and human. Compared to them, I found Robin Hood a great disappointment - perhaps McKinley will someday feel moved to bring us a second version, with Marianne as the protagonist! Despite the unheroic Robin, this book will likely be a pleasure to any fan of Robin Hood stories."
3,Real people,"Retells Robin Hood as it might have really been, with normal people who are in the right place at the wrong time. Mildly clever, entertaining, no surprises."
2,Couldn't care about the characters,"I'm a big Robin McKinley fan, but you should read something else -- Sunshine, Deerskin, or Spindle's End are all much better. In those books, with her own story line, McKinley creates much more detailed, individual, REAL characters whose struggles you come to care about. In Sherwood, the characters are of course set in advance by the classic Robin Hood tales, and they come across as flat. Not a terrible book, but not her best by far."
4,almost perfect,This is one of the best stories I have ever lived. The weak point for me was that McKinley switched viewpoint characters for most of the end. I ended up missing Robin so much that I felt let down at the end instead of built up. Too bad books can't be automatically indivigualized for the reader because I would've been higher than the balloon I lost years ago if she had just stayed with Robin.
3,Disappointing.,"I will admit that it's wonderfully done and realistic, and for that it deserves more stars. But while I admire the craftsmanship and the beauty of this book, I am also a hopeless romantic and very affected by what I read, and so was dreadfully disappointed by the end. I think . . . though it was a fair and decent end, it could have been rendered . . . more hopeful. I was, all in all, quite distressed."
5,A Fairy Tale Classic,"Robin McKinley, a master of young adult fiction, does it again with her thoughtful retelling of the story of Robin Hood. Although she stays true to the traditional storyline, the story sounds new with her use of playful banter, her careful characterization, and her attention to detail. Altogether, it is a masterpiece of escapism fiction, with few parallels to modern life, but with McKinley's keen eye for description. A classic to the core, and entertaining for teens and adults."
5,couldn't be better,"I've loved this book for years! I've probably read it 8 or 9 times and it doesn't get old. The author manages to take an old story and make it new, but without losing any of the romance inherent in the tale. Pick it up, you won't be sorry!"
3,"Nice charts, but it does not come with stickers","I like that the chart illustrates different elements of successful potty training (go fast, wash hands, stay dry, etc), but I expected the chart to come with stickers corresponding to each of the different elements. (It does not come with any stickers.) Also, while I'm sure this works well with some kids, when I tried it with mine (18mo), she just wanted to pull the stickers off :-)"
1,bad news,"This cd was unflawed to the eye, but nobody ever listened to it to make sure it sounded ok. This cd was full of background noise and was annoying to listen to. Because the shipping charges were so high, I decided to throw the cd away and reorder from a different source."
2,Imaginext nearly ruined a good thing,"My son LOVES Imaginext building sets. He is 9 years old and his friends love them, too. Even the older siblings of these friends. They make up all kinds of stories. They are using their imaginations instead of playing video games. My son begged for this software and I gave in. Within a few hours I regretted my decision. Why did I let Fisher Price come up with his story lines and adventures when he was doing it on his own? That is what is SO great about Imaginext--finally a toy that will cause even older kids to leave the computer and video games. Luckily, I think he found the software to be boring. He played it one evening and that was it. Money wasted, yes. But, I'm glad he's back to creating on his own. I also regret that Imaginext made a video to go with the toy. Let the kids make up the stories!"
4,Not as cool as the second one.,"While I'm sure that everyone else would perfer the first one because of it's more driving, iconic songs, I actually like the second one better, because of all the background tracks. This is still a great track."
5,Enjoyable Anime Soundtrack,"I received NOIR OST1 last month and have enjoyed listening to it several times since then. I watched the show recently for the first time and really enjoyed the opening song in addition to the show itself. The rest of the music was very good, so I decided to pick up the soundtrack. Note that the opening song on the CD seems to be a full version that is longer than the one in the show. I wish it had both versions. I haven't gone back and re-watched the show to check the difference.Like many other Anime soundtracks, availability and pricing varies a lot. I got OST1 for under $15 which I am now happy with. I plan on purchasing the other NOIR soundtracks when I can find a good deal.I think I'll be listening to it almost as much as my Ghost in the Shell and FLCL Anime soundtracks which are excellent and highly recommended."
3,"gets boring quick, more fun with friends",This game is a good sequel to SSB on the Nintendo 64.But it's more fun with friendsPlaying 1p all the time gets seriously boring fast especially after you beat the game. Play it with friends!!! but unlock everything first!
3,Joyful or Infuriating?,"This game comes from a great idea/concept. You can play as many Nintendo characters but it is extremely difficult for someone new to the gaming world to pick up and just play. Some of the screens move extremely fast and to a new gaming person, seem impossible to beat. It is very fun to play as the different characters if you don't let the fact that it is difficult get to you. Be ready to devote some time because you have to play this game for a long time before you can get really good at it and fully enjoy it."
5,One of the best games ever!,"I've been a fan of Super Smash Bros ever since it came out, and years later I still play it often! Can't wait for Smash Bros Brawl to come out for the Wii! This game is great for both single and multi player, and the amount of items, characters, and stages to unlock keeps the game fun for years on end. Highly recommended!"
5,Far better than the original.,"For all of you who like Super Smash for the N64 here's my advice: Buy Super Smash Melee. The graphics are above 10 times better, the sounds are immersing, and there must be tons of extras like trophies and new characters."
3,Solid Fun - At First......,"This game is lots of fun at first. But when you are stuck days later trying to unlock the secret playable characters ""Mr. Game and Watch"" and MewTwo, you realize the game is not fun anymore.The graphics look great and the characters are cool, but once you've beat the game with the characters provided you are left bored. It's one of the best Gamecube Launch games but I recommend it for the under 12 set. They always get a kick out of Picachu [winning fights]."
5,ENDLESS FUN!!,THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS GAME IS: ENDLESS REPLAY VALUE AND A MUST HAVE FOR ANY GAMECUBE OWNER AND FIGHTING FAN! OR NOSTALGIC NINTENDO FAN!
5,Awesome,"Hours and hours of fun. The combat moves are fun, stages visually entertaining, and graphics pretty good. Check out the newer version for Wii (Super Smash Bros. Brawl)."
5,My son loves this game!,This game was a repurchase for my son. He had this game once and broke it. He loves it so we bought it again for him. Can't wait for Super Smash Bros Brawl!
4,Super Smash Bros. Melee,This sequel to the N64 game is a lot better. It has a one player adventure mode if you don't have any friends. There are eleven characters you can unlock and eleven bonus stages you can unlock.There are two ways to unlock every character. You can also get 290 trophies that tell about old game charcters and secrets about your favorite characters.
5,Best game EVER!,"This game has to be the best game for gamecube (besides Tony Hawk's pro skater 3)I've ever played! I have it at my house and I usually play it every day! If you know who Roy is, Then I think he's the best player, besides Mewtwo. ... So please don't call me a ""BOY"" ! Well If you've never played this game, I suggest it to you! Hope this reveiw helped!"
4,AMAZING! BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!,"Well, this is another masterpiece by NINTENDO! This game, juust like the original is very fun, and original! Here is the low down...Graphics:Awesome!!! All the characters look like they were taken from their original games and put in this game. The arenas are also very original and cool looking. AGameplay: Best cartoon fighting game... hands down!!! All your favorite characters are included and you could just play for hours. YOU JUST GET HOOKED! AWESOME!Fun Factor: A 100 if possible! Absolutly the best! NINTENDO has created a masterpiece that will go down as one of the best games ever!This is my review... hope it was helpful! A MUST BUY!!!"
4,This Game Rules!,"This game is one of my favorites of all time. ... the single-player mode is tons of fun, and the Adventure mode is awesome. If you own a GameCube and you like fighting games, buy this game ASAP. Don't rent. Don't borrow. Buy."
5,GREAT GAME,"This is a great game. graphics are amazing.this is a must for any body that has a gamecube. Trust me, i own this game.BUY IT.it is challenging i have had this since august and i still have not beat it.buy a copy of SSB:M and u will not regret it ,Trust me."
5,This is the best game ever!!!,This is the best game ever because it has so much nintendo stars in it that has all these special moves and it has all new people and worlds to fight in and that means more fighting!
1,Didn't receive my order,I am very disappointed that up until now I haven't receive the super smash Bros Melee I ordered for my nephew for Christmas. I want my money back.
1,No Sonic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and all of the useless crap characters!!!!!!,"I hate this game. It's impossible to get extra characters. Coins and trophie makes it even harder.Pros:(Almost None)Cons:No Sonic or his friends + foes(Big thing.He is my #1 fan)Dumb caractersStupid mini gamesgets booring after 1 full battleGobbles alot of memoryWaste of moneyNow don't buy it. For no reason I have to FORMAT F-O-R-M-A-T MY Memory card. It means to DELETE!!!!!!!!! >_< I didn't even touched the gamecubeDon't buy this worthless piece of crap!If you have hard work in your memory card, don't spend $30 (Garbage if you ask me) formatting your card.I had 1 million rings in Sonic DX and IT'S ALL GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANNA LOSE YOUR DATA AND PREPARED TO KILL YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, YOU'LL BE ANGRY TO YOURSELF!"
1,IS ANYONE HERE GROWN UP????,"Is anyone here over 9? There seems to be a lot of peeps. This game is for people who go wha wha and wears diapers. It is stupid and unaddicting. Wait, let me tell you about the system called Lamcube I am going to sell my L-amecube and get a ps2 with games like Metal Gear Solid 2 and Extreme G--G. If any ... there would play ps2 because u people are wimps and can't play Scary Games. PS2 ROCKS"
1,smash brother is not my hand,i ordered almost a month ago but did not receive till aug5th. this is very very bad.
5,I fight so strong and good!,"Oh man! there are so many good things about this game that you should really go out and buy it today for the holidays! Man, I fight so good in it! Sometimes I knock them right off, and man, when they come up on the other side they are stars coming out of them. You can be so many guys, and then i fight so hard and oh man I hate kirby but he is still pretty good. Mario can do a punch where he punch you right off the screen! I like to play Link best.tony"
5,Nintendo does it again,"This game is AWESOME! Explosive graphics, awesome gameplay, easy controls, and more!!! I have the first one and I'm getting the second one for sure."
3,Super Smash Bros Brawl is way better.,"Super Smash Bros. Melee isn't as good as it's sequel on Wii. It's definitely worth buying, though. There's a good number of different modes, lots of stages, lots of characters, and more. It will keep you busy for a while, with lots of things to unlock.Presentation- 85/100Typical Smash Bros menu and opening scene.Graphics- 79/100Some things just don't look right.Sound- 90/100Super Smash Bros games always have good sound.Gameplay- 88/100This game is very fun to play most of the time.Replay Value- 64/100It gets boring before you finish unlocking everything.Overall- 72.5/100 (It's a high 3-star rating)"
2,"Fun, Sorta","This game was fun for about two days and then afterwards, I quickly became bored with the entire premise behind it. It was really fast paced and after a while I couldn't tell what I was doing. The graphics are fantastic, the music mind numbing although it boasts classic scores of video game music. Ick. So-So gaming."
5,Game Was Broken,"This game that i purchased was trash, i ordered it from the seller and recieved the item quick but when i putit in my console it didnt work. i am severly unhappy with it. i put it into my computer and ran a game cube disk verifier on it and the only data that was on it was the game cube format the game was never on the disk. on top of that it looked liek someone glued the SSBM disk cover on the disk and the disk was is poor condistion like someone put it into a disk doctor backwards, just in horrible terrible condition. but over all i have played the game before and it was alot of fun a good family or friends game"
3,Poor single player game...,"My neighbor recently bought this game for his gamecube. He likes it, but it is really a boring game for just one person. All you do is fight the computer and after the orginal novelty wears off, the game is boring and repeditive. However, the reason I game it three stars instead of one or two is the multiplayer games. This game is very fun if you want to play two to four players. I recommend renting this game before you buy it and deciding for yourself. Personally, I think it isn't worth the 50 dollars it costs."
4,Things about this Game,"Super Smash Bros. Melee was a fun game. But, after a while it got boring. I mean, the same vs. mode over and over again. I know some cheats too, if you'd like to know. They aren't so bad anyway. Select Ness as the computer player make him any level and click on Jungle Japes and DON'T move. Oh yeah, you have to make it one stock too. Then he'll automatically fall out if you don't move. You should try it. It's a good way to unlock things. Mr. Game and Watch isn't so fabulous after all. It isn't worth those longs hours of playing. I mean, come on, he's a 19th century freak. And you can't even see his eyes. The good stuff about it is that you can get trophies and it's sort of funny. And if one day, you manage to do everything and get 99 trophies of everything then you are worthy to be called the Super Smash Bros. Melee champ."
2,A Must Play,This game is the one game all people should have if you own a GameCube system. The game combines people from many different games and puts them in a free-for-all match for survivle. The Game will knock your socks off with its graphics and sound.
5,"Best video game out their, hands down!","Although the PS2 and Xbox have dominated the GameCube in sales, they have not dominated in quality. This is a perfect example of a ""5 star"" video game. This game provides hours of multiplayer fun that just can't be beat by any other game out there. The single player may not be the best, but it provides you with enough to do, collecting trophies and all. If you haven't tried this game yet, I STRONGLY recommend you buy it, don't even rent it! I guarantee you'll love it!"
5,A Must Have,This game is by far the BEST game you can get for Gamecube. To prove my point that this is a must have just look at the Nintendo Power Charts. It has been a best seller ever since it came out.This game has kept me entertained for over a year. One thing that keeps me motivated to play this is that I want to unlock every single thing possible. There is a lot to unlock and it takes it awhile to get. And all the characters are so diverse its almost impossible to not find one that fits your groove.The games best part is its multiplayer. You can play it with friends for hours because there is so many stages and rules you can change. Every match you play is a little different. And when you are only playing with one or two friends you can add in a computer controlled player to make things more interesting.There is nothing bad in this game.This game is a must have. Without this game your Gamecube collection is incomplete. If you have any doubts about getting it I encourage you to banish them.
5,Super Smash is awsome,"This game is great u can be any of your favorite nintendo characters such as mario and luigi,Link,DK,and much much more and to win characters u need to do something diffrent for each one so it can be challenging u can also smash,throw,and blast your enimies anywhere u want sometimes when u hit your enemy outside the arena the person might hit the tv u can rent the game if u can find it but if u buy it it's only 29.99 get this game it's awsome"
5,Hours of a SMASHING good time!,"Package arrived on time and came exactly how the seller described. In used- very good condition It is in excellent shape and my family has been enjoying it non-stop. I had played earlier versions of this game over at friend's houses and really loved it and so when I decided to get a game consol I had to make this game part of my collection.It's a great game for all ages although rated ""T"" for teen. Choose from several different Nintendo characters and battle with friends or computer characters of your choice. Choose several different varieties of game play, stages, and characters. Have never ending fun and the odds ever changing. I highly recommended this game choice."
4,taunting has never been more funny,this game is cool and everything but links taunt move is hilarious! its kind of disgraceful to him and gives him a bad name.
4,one of the best games ever!!!,I got this game ...and I have to say I loved it!!.Their is tons of characters and the graphics are amazing!!...
5,Too Young for Smashing?,"Overall, Super Smash Brothers Melee is a great 'fighting' game. You get to pick a character, and a color, and each character has their own moves. There are many hidden levels, and a great random feature which picks a level for you. Why was it rated T? There's no blood, violence, or really anything wrong with it. If Pikachu shocking mewtwo is violent, then I don't know what the world is coming to."
5,Greatest Game Ever,"A Variety of modes to play. unlimited posibilities. Enhanced move list with awesome effects.25 characters including Ganandorf, Mew Two, Doctor Mario,young link and many others. collecting over two-hundred trophies provides a unique challange. Definitly a game you want to buy.Even more fun on multyplayer"
5,NINTENDO STARS KICK BUTT ONCE MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best gamecube game you will find. Over 20 nintendo characters and more then 20 stages. New adventure, Stadium, coin, event, tournament and even more modes! You got a gamecube? You got 3 friends then buy it! I assure you this is the best game for multiplayer freaks."
5,Super Smash Fun!,"Mabye i never played it before,but it just looks great!The new charecters(bowser,princess peach,snow kids and princess zelda in a freaky costume)also all the others!And in melee,when you throw a pokeball you can get one of the neo pokemon!cool,huh?thats why i give it 5 stars!"
5,WOW,When i saw this game i thought it was a [joke] that just had all the nintedo chracters in it. When i acctually played it it was amazing everything in it was the great. It just provides tons of laughs and good times. Its multiplayer mode is the best. You'll defintaly be getting good deal for buying this game
4,"Good, but this is an easy game","This game is cool, but this is the easiest game. You can play as Mario,Peach, Bowser, Link,Captain Falcon,Pickachu etc.Secret characters are Jigglypuff,Ganondorf,Pichu,Mewtwo,Young Link, Falco, and Mr.Game&Watch.This game has lots of cool things, but in general it is easy but cool."
3,"O.K. game play but, the graphics stink",When this game first came out it was a hit and I loved it but now I notis that the game play is not all as go as it is said to be. I is a fun multi player game but it dose tend to cheat some times and it gives you or the opponent a unfare advantage like when you are hanging off a ledg when you get up you will be immortall for a second so the opponent wont get a strike on you or it would be to simple to KO someone but some times it dose not do that or it makes you immortall but when you are ready to attack you become mortal so the opponent can easily attack you with no worry of getting hit. Over all it is fun and you sould in joy it.
2,ooooh i wish i had more details before i bought,this game is about fighting it is not like mario 3. overall it is ok
2,My kids seem to like this game,"I've played all of our GameCube games with my kids at one time or another, but this one just escapes me. I don't really see a point to it other than pushing, hitting, shocking, and kicking the other player in the game, which usually raises their ire and they end up pushing, hitting, and kicking each other outside of the game too.I prefer games like The Incredibles and the Star Wars Lego game that has the two players cooperating in the game instead of competing with each other. I don't mind competition, but this is just like a kid's version of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, I think.If I would have known before hand what this game was like, I would not have purchased it."
2,buy if you are 15 and younger,this game is better for persons 15 and younger. i actually bought the game b/c i thought it was going to be an adventure game (i.e. sonic). everything moves way too fast and it is difficult to control the characters or to even understand what you are doing. bring back the days of streetfighter and mortal combat.
3,"Fun, But Gets A Little Old","When I first got SSB Melee, oh yeah, I was pretty impressed. But around the 6th or 7th time I played it, it just died. Now no, its not a bad game. But it will get you sick of playing games. It does have some new characters to unlock like Mr. Game & Watch, which after all I was surprised to see on there. You can play with four buddies and still not have very much fun. Yet, somehow it remains stisfying. Overall, it get a 3 out of 5 because it feels a little expired if you know what I mean."
2,Not a Fan,After reading all about this game and then getting it I was pretty dissapointed. It is nothing more than a fighting game that lacks excitement to me.
1,avoid!,"OK, I had this game on n64 and hated it. read all these reviews and rather than be suckered again i rented it. it is worse than the first one. like others, i think everyone that gave it 5 stars is 5 years old. it is very boring, easy, pointless, and flat out stupid. but hey, don't listen to me, go waste 50 bucks. maybe you'll get lucky and be able to sell it on ebay for 20 bucks..."
1,this game sucks,"i think the game stinks because the first one was almost the same as this one. If you like good games, get another one because this one stinks on ice."
1,HATER OF SUPER SMASH BRO. MELEE,"(...)DONT BUY IT , ITS SO EASY TO BEAT!!!!!!!ALL THESE PEOPLE SAY ITS GOOD.....I DONT THINK SOTHEY JUST LIKE IT BECAUSE IT PROBABLY HAS THERE FAVORITECHARACTER ON IT.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!DONT BUY THIS GAME.I SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULDNT ASK FOR IT FOR CHRISTMAS.ASK FOR SOMETHING BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
5,I can't wait!!!!!!,"When Super Smash Bros. came out, I thought it was another cheap fighting game. When I tried it, I was amazed! I wanted to buy it really bad, but my parents wouldn't let me because they didn't think it would last long for me. Now, Super Smash Bros. Melee will be my first game for GameCube and I haven't seen anything sweeter! I got a lot of info from the internet and I can tell you this: more items, worlds, characters, options, moves, better graphics and sound, and a MUCH better single-player mode!!! Now you actually have to get through a part of that world before actually fighting the character! When this game comes out, I'll be for sure to get it on the first day!!!"
5,Kids really like it,I bought this to replace the same game before as it got broken at our day care center. The kids really like it and boys and girls both enjoy playing it.
3,Its ok:{,well there are more charecters but the graphics are exactly the same. Mabie theres a diferance but i can't tell.
5,the best,"AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH I could go on screaming how cool this game is. there is nothing beter than having a hand to hand oldschool battle. if I could rate this game in stars i would put a 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 star rating on it. my favriot part is being link. I have enjoyed the wonderful fighting in all zelda games since I first got my nintendo along with legend of zelda ocorina of time. I am just so excited to be able to get that clasic slash 'em up gaming on this game I hope you by this and if you dont EENY OWNY WANHA that will give you 64 years of bad luck HA HA HA :) :) :)"
5,Still the best fighting game,"Super Smash Bros., originally for Nintendo 64 was a great game ... but compared to this, it is and has nothing. This newer, updated version has everything, including more characters, more stages, more weapons ... that means, more fun. The best characters are Link, Roy and Donkey Kong. The best multiplayer game! You can fight each other or fight on the same team, beat the heck out of the worthless computers or have a real challenge by trying to beat Adventure Mode without dying or retaining health by the three hearts ON VERY HARD mode. This game is semi easy to beat but if you really want to BEAT it...you have to beat it on VERY HARD, every mode.An excellent buy and a timeless game."
5,4 player action game with nintendo characters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is the best of 4 player action nintendo has ever done! it has samus, falco, fox, ness, mario, luigi, DK, dr. mario, and lots more! it has lots of stages to choose from, lots of characters to be, and lots of moves to do! collect trophies, do a homerun contest, practice your fighting skills, go on an adventure, or just do whatever you want! there are 25 chacters in all but there are rumors that you can get sonic..."
4,this game rocks!,"Before you get this game, I want you to know a few things. first, this game has really good graphics, (most backround things are paper 3D though) this game is only left, right, duck, and jumpish, so there's no moving forward or backward, (unluckily for me, I didn't know that) multi player is the main thing, so I recomend you have 4 controlers, and 1 player mode is only to unlock new players to play in multi player. multi player is Sooo fun, and you can actualy unlock some places from the nintendo 64 vershion!Patrick, age 9"
3,"Overrated : Yes , Bad : No","Super snash bros is fun , but sometimes a human player can be very cheap. SOme times it feels more like a race to a hammer or pokeball than a fighting game. And if you double jump and get hit you'll die .Pros:Funlong live 2-dCons:CheapRaceOverall:Worth the hype:Maybe , worth the price : maybeScore 6.75"
2,Costs too much now,"Ok seriously why is this game 107 bucks in 2012? I mean seriously it costs more than brawl. Amazon made a HUGE mistake.Plus it could use more characters. Sakurai, you have to make ssb4 better than THIS."
4,no i will not change my review,"no i will not change my review need i say more i read other others review not so good , so don't e-mail again this is the 3rd time enough is enough virg"
3,Never got the product...,I never got the product... I don't know what happened with my order. Never got any email explaining anything. Guess it'll be a bad review
4,amazing delivery time and great working product,"I recieved my product/game in a matter of 36 hours exactly. This seller has a great delivery response time. And the best part about it all, was that the product/game was in great condition and works perfectly. Good lookin' out"
4,good GaMe,this is a good game but its alittle kiddy its worth the 50 bucks but it gets kind of old if u want fun and u love the nintendo charators buy this game!!
4,GET IT!!!,YOU MUST GET THIS GAME IT IS THE BEST!!!!!I LOVE USING SAMUS AND HER GRAPPLE BEAM GET THE GAME!!!!!
5,Another Great Mario Game,Another Mario Game that is entertaining and fun for lots of people and great for parties. Nothing that I haven't said before.
5,wow,This game is incredible with addictive multiplayer and single player modes. Lots of goodies to unlock will keep you coming back! Do yourself a favor and don't goto spoiler sites and find out the secrets -- discover them yourself!
4,Why this product is good,This product is good because you get to battle other people and you get to battle against the computer and against your friends. You should get this product. It is very good. It would make your day.
5,The greatest sequel ever to the N64 version,"This game is one of the reasons why I want to get a gamecube for Christmas.It has more characters, features, and areas too."
5,The best!,"Just look at every other review. I'm gonna try not to reapeat everyone else but here goes..........FUN AS HELL! If you liked the first one you'll like this. If you didn't play the first one you'll like this. And if you hated the first...well, you'll still like. Many modes, characters (but we need some Rareware characters like from Banjo-Kazooie, Jet Force Gemini, or DK 64), and levels. Best with a horde of peeps to play with. Gather your many friends (lots of 'em) for tornament mode, I assure you it wll be great and very fun. Some modes are kinda usless (like tiny melee mode) but who the hell cares?! This game is really great. Buy now, its at a low price and will probably be gone fast. GET SSBM!"
4,Ready....Go!,"This game, is one of the best games for GC, and at an awsome price! I first played the old one at my friend's house last summer, and when I played this one, I was really happy.When you play in this game, the graphics acually made your experience more fun. There are many hidden secrets to some of the levels. And, they can be useful, or harmful to your character.My friends and I always put it on Camera mode and go to the Hyrule Temple, and play Link, Gandorf, and Zelda/Sheik. We come up with awsome pictures and we make up our own storylines. It's really cool.The one player can get boring, but, when doing it for Trophies, then it's kind of worth it.Overall, there are more things that make this game awsome, but I really can't say, for I don't own the game. I'm hoping to buy it soon, now that is cheeper."
5,fun fun fun,"I recomend this to anyone that likes good graphics,fights,bosses,challinges,thrills,and/or action.This is by far the best game I have piayed"
5,Great game but I received the 2007 madden football in the case.,I bought the game for my son very hard game to find so I understand the few problems I had with this company they did good by refunding my money overall I received the game on a timely fashion wrong game but again not an easy game to get yes I will purchase again from this company being in sales myself I understand that we can't make everybody happy I try 8-10 in my line of work and I feel all sales bussinesses should strive for the same.
5,super smash bros melee,"this is one of the most best video games I ever played because it has more characters then the old game.It has enough hidden characters and stages to keep you busy for months,maybe years.And it has great graphics,great sounds,great every thing.If you are going to buy a new system,buy a GAMECUBE take it from me because I own one."
5,Melee Blows Away Competition!!!,"Super Smash Bros. Melee is without a doubt the greatest and most fun multiplayer game ever made for any console. The replay value is virtually unlimited, and the mechanics of the game are flawless. In addition, visuals are stunning and the game exhibits an soundtrack extroadinary for any game. This is the ultimate party game, and if your playing alone, it's still awesome! Don't wait another moment! Get Melee as soon as possible; you'll never regret it!"
3,Sonic and Tails,"This game is very hard. It's graphics are OK, but what stinks in how it is a left to right game. You cannot roam freely like in Pikmin. This game is especiallly hard to control. Hidden Characters like Falco and Ganondorf are near impossible. There is also one secret of the game that nobody knows. You can unlock Sonic the Hedgehog and his Partner, Tails. All you have to do, is get 20 KOs in Cruel Melee. This is Impossible, if you want proof you can get them, get Electronic Gaming Monthly. Have fun trying to get them!!"
3,It's sorda fun,"I woudn't by a new version because it's so expensive to make it fun. first, you have to have at least two controllers plus a memory card and of course the game."
5,Super Smash Bros.Melee,This game is super cool!!!i played like 10 times in the mall and is COOL!Go buy it!
3,Gets Boring and 2 much mario,theres mario everything. it gets boring and most of the cheats dont work. 1 of the only things i like about the game is you can beat the snot out of people. if you have played the this on N64 for all you parents out there the T rating should be a E. it doesnt have blood or anything. my parents bought for me when i was 8.
1,STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this game stinks!!!!!.i first get this game to be fun. BUT IT HAS BAD WORDS!!!!!!!!!.IT HAS BLOOD AND KILLING!!!!!!!.IF YOU GOT THIS GAME I WOULD SEND IT BACK IF I WERE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.I HATE THIS GAME.
1,Help! Me!,"Who is the best (Strongest) character in this game. And how do you get it????????? I need to get 20 KOs (Knock outs) in cruel melee because it says you can get Sonic and Tails (Togethor) if you get 20 KOs. Please tell meeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.P.S you can get toad. Just shoot all of the credits. For more information I said, go to ebgames.com and look at some reviews for this game. Tell me and I'll get rid of the list I wrote for No sonic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,NOT EASY TO FIND!,"The game was okay, but my kids lost interest two days after Christmas. There are other games with this same character that they like even more."
1,Booooooooooooooo! This game stinks real bad,The only thing you do is beat people(things) up. The only reason I took the time to rate this was because it has pretty good graphics.I played it for 6 minutes and new it stunk.I'd rather play with those baby block things.(I got an honor roll so I know what I'm talkin' about!!!!!)
1,what were they thinking when they made this game,super smash bros was a dissapointing game there was no storyline what so ever once you beat everything there was nothing more to do.Damn i wished the producers would put more places and characters in the game.
1,"Weak fighting concepts, Weak game in general","This game, although somewhat fun with 4 people has a terrible single player mode and fight physics that rival that of my grandmother. Hardcore fighting fans must steer clear from this abomination of a game. Inevitably once you get 4 friends over to play the game does become fun, but then surely gets repetitive. As you play for a week you master it without any real skill involved and in the end your just said you spent 50 bucks on a mediocre party game.Don't buy unless your have a 6 year old kid who has 3 friends following him around."
1,Just the same as the first,"Don't beleve what the other people think about this game. Sure it has great graphics, but the game play is the exact same as the first Super Smash! It may have more characters and more levels, but if you beat the first one, why do you want to do it again just with more characters? It is a rip off! I thought this game was going to be the best game for the GameCube, but I just wasted $[money] on a game I already had. If you love Super Smash Bros and you are willing to beat it again with more characters, buy it..."
4,Excellent Game,"My son is 12 and has autism and loves this game. He plays gamecube games on the Wii more than he does the Wii games.He had this game years ago but it got broke and we had to throw it away, he was devastated. We finally bought him another one and he plays the game every day since we got it."
4,Super Smash Bros. Melee,"This is my absolute favorite game. The cutting-edge graphics are amazing! These graphics are so good that if you look closely, the characters show expressions with most controls. Unlike the first title for Nintendo64, ever so seldom does a button delay. In fact, they react so quickly it is almost as if they react before you even touch the button(s) pressed. There are originally 14 selectable characters, but as you go trough, complete goals, and play the multiplayer options you will recieve a chance to earn 11 more. For each character there is about 1-3 optional battle arenas(earned seperatelly). When you get to about 3/4 of the game you start to earn secret unlockables, in which give a strong advantage to your gameplay. Out of what I've told you so far, you can bet this is the game for you."
5,Awesome,"I think this game is really fun because it has lots of game modes. You can be alot of characters and it is fun to unlock the secret characters, and special levels."
5,I wish I could put five billion stars!,"If I were you, I would consider this game the greatest multi-player game ever made. The graphics are better than the original Super Smash Bros. and there are more characters, too. I like Mewtwo. Once you unlock Mr. Game and Watch, or at least when you fight him to unlock him, you'll see that he's EXTREMELY weird. I mean, he's a black shadow thingy, for cryin' out loud! I do wish they could have some sort of Pokemon switch, sort of like the item switch, so you could turn different Pokemon on & off that appear from the Pokeball item. So anyway, I love this game and you should really buy it."
5,Gamecubes pride!,"Amazing game- even better than the original! What I loved best was the new stages (and also revamps of old ones, like kirby's). The best in my opinion are the fzero stage (the action moves so fast, and there's a place where all there is to fight on is a teeny platform in midair) and the new starfox one (for a short period fighting in total darkness - the mayhem!). The graphics are nothing short of superb with realistic water and great light effects acting on the characters. Overall, one of the best multiplayer games on any platform!"
3,Kill Mario,"It's a great game as there are many characters to use and there are many characters and levels to unlock.It's a cool experience killing other nintendo characters but once you've unlocked all the characters, level and maybe events, the game becomes extremely repetetive on multiplayer mode.They should have also included Wario, Waluigi and maybe even the Baby Mario Bros. (...)"
4,The funnest fighter on the GCN.,"This game has an easy combat system just a few buttons to memorize. It has all different kinds of fighters, from Donkey kong to Samus Aran they've got it all. On top of that you can collect trophies from all sorts of games. 11 blocks of memory, for 1-4 players, rated T for Teen. This is a must buy."
1,Terrible Experience,I order this thinking it was a great value. Well it was too good to be true. Not sure where all the great ratings are coming from. I order for x-mas. Got it after x-mas...not a big deal. I opened the package and it all looked like the cover you see here. The only problem was it was not the right game. It was FIFA Football 2003. How does that happen? It also was in German which is again not a big deal but it was not clear to me that is was in German when I ordered it.I have to return the item to Germany at my cost to get a refund. Buy beware of Momox.comShame on you Amazon as well!
4,Not Bad!,"The game has the best graphics and doesn't get boring in multiplayer. The only bad thing about it is that I've had the game for Christmas and I've not yet gotten one of the secret characters (Mewtwo). I haven't been really trying hard, but I've only played about 13/20 hours required. Everything else, overall, is perfect! You don't need to rent it if you liked the first Super Smash Bros.!!"
4,SUPER SMASH TIME!,"If you like super smash brothers for N64 you'll like this game.It has more secret characters,more features,and it also has secret worlds.If you like the one for N64 you'll like this game.OK! Now buzz off!!!!!!!!!!"
4,SMB Melee,"This game is very fun. If you like Mario, you'll like this. Try toget all trophies and charecters, while opening all 50 extra games.You can play with 4 players. Also, try playing while invisible."
4,Yo Ya'll try dis game,This was the first game I ever had so I am kind of bored of it but it's still fun.There are a lot of characters as other people have mentionedbut some people say they have these guys(and girls)King DeDeDeSonicTailsKnucklesGregoAnd blah blah blah
5,the game is moreeeeeeeee better than N64 version¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡,"when i buy the game and turn on the NGC i said: i can't believe... the intro is very good and when i play with my little brother in versus mode is really cool...the moviment are great and the details, this game will be great for all people that played the super smash bros in N64, i can't compare the two games.i love the nintendo, the x box is really powerfull but don't is a nintendo....."
4,BIGGEST HIT EVER FOR GAMECUBE!!,"This is the best game ever! You can play as Mario, Bowser, Kirby, Link, Pikachu, DK, Samus, and many more! This game has it all. From over 8 modes, to more than 5 secret characters! If feel like throwing fireballs, BUY THIS GAME!!!"
5,...WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE THINKING?,"Why are you reading these reviews?This is one of the BEST GCN games out there.Just BUY IT.- Kolby ManningOh, and P.S. - fire dragon99, you loser. There is not a PS2 version of this game! Stop living under a soundproof ROCK! Why would Sony publish a game LOADED with NINTENDO characters? And if the game did exist, there is no way that it would be ""A lot better."" PS2 Sucks and ruins games. Just go play your little PS2 nonexistent SSBM. And get a spell checker."
5,Super Smash Brothers Meele,"This is a must buy game, with lots of new stuff. The game features 23 yes 23 stages in all! Plus over 20 playable characters. Secret characters include Shiek, Zelda, Gannondorf and many more. Anyway there are all new modes such as Tournament,1-player adveture, gallery mode, coin battle, HP mode, and possibly a homerun tournament! Now in SSBM there are 30 items like the spy cloak, laser machine gun, umbrella, food, and more to be reavealed. But if you get gamecube let this be your 1st coice."
4,..SUPER SMASH BROTHERS MELEE is OK,"At first I thought this would really stink, since I'm not a violence fan. The game has more of a point than punching Mario or socking Luigi. There are secret characters that you can unlock (like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1,2, and 3). Also there are secret levels to win too. All these things can be played with once they are unlocked. After you beat certain things, you get coins and trophies. With the coins you can ""gamble"" to get more trophies. This game is pretty fun but not really my favorite."
4,another near perfect game from nintendo,"First of all, this is one of the most entertaining games i have ever played. The reason is the multiplayer. when the original super smash brothers was released the programmers realized that the most talked about aspect of the game is the multiplayer. It is so great because of how simple it is to play, yet how complex it can get. SSB: melee is also very unique. it is one of the only games to use items as a key element during a battle. Yet this game does have its shortfalls. the new adventure mode is nice, but the basic game has gone virtually unchanged. the classic mode gets VERY boring after a while, but the fact that there are 25 characters to fight with and unlock keeps you playing for a while. this is a fun game but not perfect."
5,Best game ever!!!!!!,"Super Smash is a relly great game! It has all the characters from the old game and some new characters (young link,doctor mario,gannondorf,falco,pichu,jigglypuff,pichu,mr.game and watch,mewtwo,marth,and roy). It also has a bunch of new places,modes, and items, which would take forever to list. The best item is the super scope. The game takes a long time to unlock everything, but it will still be fun to play even after you have unlocked everything!"
3,Simply a rehash,"If you're looking for the same game that you had on the N64 then you have found it, just with different stages. The gameplay is still as a tired as it was on the N64 and inevitably as boring as well. This game only adds to the growing concern that Nintendo has been and will continue to dull the senses with it's overemphasis on appealing to the younger audience. If you have a short attention span and want little depth to your fighters, then by all means purchase this game. Otherwise, stear clear of this one."
5,This is the BEST gamecube game!,I played this at one of the cube clubs and it is a great game. It's better than the first one by like times 500. Theres so many characters to choose from and there was like 6 or 7 secret characters. The levels are a lot of fun too. THIS IS A MUST BUY GAME!!!
4,good or great,super smash bros melee was a good game the only thing is that if you have ouned the first smash bros melee gets boring after awile some good things about this game is the graphics on the levels are great and their are tones of seceret charictors all in all if you really liked the first one you will like this one
5,The best game I've ever played!!!,"Firstoff, I want to tell you how amazing the graphics were when I played it, although it was for 3 minutes. You could see Mario's overall's buttons!The gameplay is awesome, featuring much wider ranges of new charachters thann the one for N64. Some of the charachters are Ice Climbers, Zelda, Roy, Gannondorf, Mr. Game and Watch,etc. On a scale of 100, I give ...Graphics:99Gameplay:85 [I couldn't get the items]Controller:94Characters:100Action:95I have played around 110 different video games, all longer than this, and this one is very easily the best!You can even take it in the car/truck/van!A must buy for anyone!!!!!"
5,This is nice,"I first played in one of my friends' house. I didn't know how to play this, so I thought this was going to be one boring game. I was wrong. This game has 25 characters from Classical Nintendo games, like Mario Bros., Game and Match, and etc. All the characters have its own unique attack, and combined with high-quality graphics, this is one perfect game.This game is also fun for its maps; the scene and battlefield where you play with your characters. Although it's only 2-dimensional, the maps will have nothing except some big island floating in midair. Also, in some maps the enviroment will change from time to time, like Pokemon Stadium. Sometimes mysterious crates or things that might attack the players might happen. Anything imaginable is possible.This is a great game- I really want to get this game because still I haven't got this game. This is the best Gamecube game ever. For anyone who likes funny fights or colorful action, you MUST buy this game. Signed- Super Smash Bros. Maniac"
5,"A Must Have For All GameCubers,","You just got to have it. My mom,dad,and sister bought me this game, a Gamecube, a memory card, and an additional controller for my 11th birthday. This game is so fun. It has all the classic characters from the Nintendo 64 classic like Mario, Fox, Samus Aran, Link, and the others. There are also some new characters like Yoshi, Peach, and Bowser. Unlike the N64 classic, you can unlock secret characters, such as Marth and Luigi. My sister and I REALLY enjoy this game. This is a great game for anybody with a Gamecube. Super Smash Bros. Melee. It's a must have."
2,it is ok,i got this on time but it was a bit scratched it would not work on my wii so i had to pull out the game cube
1,horrible game condition,"i recieved the disc in the mail today. as soon as i put the game in to play it froze and would not load. i reset the console over and over but it still froze and would not load. the seller is very good about giving refunds, very simple and easy. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
4,Super Smash Better Than Expected,"Hey everybody. I would really reccomend this to the player who plays Gamecube MUCH. It has many more, cool, and interesting levels, characters [I LOVE ALL OF THEM (see*)], and many features. There is a homerun contest, and break the targets is back!!! This game is really good. * back to characters. Ice Climbers, Roy, Marth. All cool. Bowser rocks. Mr Game and Watch, etc. There is soo many. PLus, there are a whole wack of new moves. Ness has sooo many!!! Even though you have to play the game MANY TIMES.....800 OR SO TO UNLOCK PEOPLE.....its totally worth it"
2,Eh?,"this game is fun when you play it with 2-4 people, but single player is just boring, and a waste f your time.if you only have 1 controller, or none of your friends like this game, buy Animal Crossing, it's fun."
4,Only if you like to smash,"According to my kids, this is the coolest game but personally, if you have vertigo, I'd advise against it. The game performs really well, no glitches in the programming that I've witnessed but the graphics can be overwhelming. Also the music is so repetitive and there is no option to turn it off. And like all other Game Cube games, I find this a bit expensive."
4,LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLLLLLLEEEEEEEE!,"Without this game, I doubt I would've ever brought the GCN. This game was the main reason why I brought the GCN. Other than Racing and RPG's which are my favorite genre of video games, this is my only favorite fighting game that I love. My favorite part of this game other than collecting trophies from Nintendo's past, is knocking the stuffing out of everybody with my favorite character Luigi, yeah that's right LUIGI. The graphics are great, especially the Final Destination battlefield which was breath-taking. For graphics, I would give it 10/10. The controls were great which also deserve a 10/10. The music was da bomb, especially with the sound test option (you can unlock the sound test option by uncovering all of the characters and secret stages and getting the Marin trophy). As other people have said, your GCN collection isn't complete unless you have this game."
4,how to get Mr. Game &Whatch,how to get him u will have to get ervy charter in the game.Then u do ervy guy in classic.
1,Super Smashin',This is a great game for anyone who loves fast action and great graphics. Its just like the first but with twice as many characters. Its also good for multiplayer.
4,SSB Melee Review ......... sort of.,"Hello! Well, I've played Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo64, and I think that SSB is fun; I also think that SSBM looks good too! I'd recommend it since I enjoyed the first one."
1,Used games for the Gamecube,"I bought this game used for the gamecube and it did not work. I have had no problems in the past with used games for my PS2, but the used games for the gamecube are bad. They either freeze up or dont work at all. I guess i need to quit being cheap and buy new."
1,HORRIBLE TOY PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT BUY,"This game is fun for like an Hour then gets boring.The first day i got it i played it one time, and then traded it in at EB GAMES."
1,Best Game for Gamecube I have played yet,This game is the $hit. (I mean that in a good way). The best thing about it is thaT IT IS AWESOME in multiplayer!! I love playing it with friends. There is 290 trophies which will keep you occupied for a while and characters and stages to earn also. I also like how it has an adventure mode instead of being fighting the whole time. Also I like the home run contest which makes this game unique and cool.This game is hard to master and will keep you occupied for a while as i have been since February. I strongly suggest you get this game.
5,Super Smashing Fun!,"This game is so versitile. There are so many things to unlock and lots of Nintendo characters to fight with. It also has contests, vs modes, and three one player arcade modes. There are lots of trophies to find and lots of items to use when fighting. It is rumored that you can get Paper Mario as a playable character, i don't know if this is true. I do know some of the unlockable characters are Falco, Ganandorf, Roy, Marth, Mewtwo, Mr. Time and watch, Dr. Mario, Luigi, Pichu, Jiggly Puff, and Young Link. The regular characters are Mario, Bowser, Princess, Zelda/Shiek, Kirby, Pikachu, Link, Pe-king, Star Fox, CPT Falcon, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Ice Climers, and one other one which I can't think of now. There are 14 regular characters and 25 all together. This game rocks, especially for versus battles with your friends. It has several stages to fight in, some of which you have to unlock."
4,Turner-Social Work Treatment,"This was a required textbook for an Integrated Methods graduate Social Work course. It is an excellent book. I would highly recommend it. My only complaint is that even the newest edition (4th) is pretty old. I realize that some of these theories haven't changed, so that doesn't matter. However, I like to use the bibliographies for other research; the references are all even older than the book... Turner needs to update it again..."
1,On the Power to be Nasty,"I shouldn't have to say anything about this book to show how nasty a history of a powerful nation is bound to be. Allow me to quote an obvious quote; Kether! ""'For by St Paul', quoth he, 'I will not to dinner before I see thy head off.' It booted him not to ask 'Why'"" (p. 2)."
3,"Cute themed castle, but not a easy to store ""toy"".","Cute castle, and for those with play areas or children who are true castle fans this is a great product. My son did not use often, so we had the issue of finding spots to store to keep out of the way. It is wood and not something my 5 year old needed to carry by himself."
3,good quality but pricey for the functionality,"Took some time to put together and was quite costly! Like the fact that it is made of wood, but thought it could have some more fun features..."
2,tachikara bag,"I was disappointed with this item...what i received is a bag with nylon holes, a round bottom and a drawstring closure. Not at all what the picture presents!"
3,OK stories,"This is a good book for very young kids, but some of the content is above them. The Bible stories could be used for upper grades, yet the wording is very simple."
5,beautiful illustrations,We got this book for our four-year-old daughter. It's perfect for her. The illustrations throughout are very well done and the stories are easy for children to understand.
5,I'm Charmed,I am hopelessly addicted to this show!! I love watching shows involving real families and real issues - Charmed has all that and more! The bickering between the sisters and how they overcome the separation leads to a turnaround so they can all work together to destroy all the demons that come in their path. This show can be watched by everyone over the age of 13 years without really bad side effects. It's a show about how families can come together; work together and still get the job done with the love for each other.
3,packaging damaged,The teeth that hold the dvds in the cases are all broken. The dvds are not damaged as far as I can tell but its going to be a headaches finding cases for storing them.
4,charmed,product shows great came in a timely matter I am satisfied with my order. Would buy again from him thanks
5,The Greatest,Charmed is one of the greatest shows on the air. Like a lot of others out ther Prue was one of the best sisters ever. She is very much missed. Since they can bring back Grams and Mom they need to do several episodes with Prue coming back to help the sisters once again. She needs to meet her new sister. There is a lot of potential for this show and so much more can be done with all the lost like Andy and Cole and Prue and Grams. I can't wait til the new season.
5,Gets Better By The Season,"This season is great too. I cried during ""Awakened"" due to Piper being my favorite Charmed One. As I said in review of season 1, I watched each episode three times. I stretch the viewing out as I don't want to go through the seasons to quickly."
4,Charming,Well I loved the Series and watched them when I was living in America for several years and watched them again in German but I love the original Language better thats why I bought the two seasons and will also buy the rest seasons.
3,Missing Episodes,"I have been and am an avid Charmed fan, and watched almost all of the episodes the entire time during the original airing of Charmed. I am somewhat disappointed in these supposed 'complete sets', since there appears to be missing episodes. I can't quite pin it down, but toward the end of a set for each year, there appear to be gaps."
2,Shame about the predictable stories,"Unfortunately the character writing of creator Constance M. Burge is stiffled by the format of having to feature 'monsters' attacking the characters and then... suprise... being defeated EVREY SINGLE episode.On a more serious note, the positive portrayal of dabbling in the occult should not rest well with Christians in particular."
3,charmed season 2,"i forgot how boring this season of charmed was. its not bad, and the quality of the boxed set is good, but the episodes arent the really exciting ones, plus they're on tv on rerun all the time."
1,Charmed - the complete second season!,I have not receive my order yet! This is the first time it happened to me. I am a regular amazon customer. This is my third year!
3,Second Season Pretty Good,The second season was pretty good. It isn't as good as the first or third but it is entertaining none the less.
4,Learning cunning through written text.,"Greg Downey is his book ""Learnig Capoeira: Lessons in Cunning from an Afro-Brazilian Art"" strikes at the some of the very important fundamentals of Capoeira that every practitioner from Angola to Regional should hold close.He speaks from a backround in sociolgy and phenomenolgy. His arguments are strong whilst his stories entertaining. Neither form of Capoeira is looked over nor does he argue for one particular style, he gives a wonderful overview of the mythologies, teachings and importance of Angola and Regional.A great book and a wonderful learning tool."
3,Slow and Underlined,"This book took almost an entire month to arrive at my residence. Had I ventured to pick the book up on foot, I could have received it faster. Many notes were highlighted, which is to be assumed a possibility for a used book. I was seriously disappointed by the arrival time. Usually I receive my orders from amazon in the minimal amount of approximated time."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased two of these phones for my roomates as Christmas gifts. First of all, the range is terrible, secondly once you get beyond 20 feet WITHOUT obstructions there is a discernable amount of static. The components of this phone are very low quality, the phone feels as if it has no substance, and it clicks while in the charging base."
4,The Punisher's past catches up with him,"If you're looking for a ""vintage"" 80s Punisher tale full of all the things you've come to expect from him and the action genre of comics, you might want to give this graphic novel a gander. Included in this adventure are several signature Punisher situations: Frank mowin' down criminals, Frank mowin' down some more criminals, lotsa of angst & rage, Vietnam flashbacks, and the final one-on-one ""fight"" where our fave homicidal maniac goes by his own rules and does the unexpected to attain dark victory. Underrated penciler/ co-colorist Mike Zeck's art (with finishing touches by inker John Beatty and wonderful pre-PhotoShop-era coloration) is top-notch.`Late"
5,"He-Man does it yet again, awes me.","I had many grand memories of watching this show and being completely taken aback by its wonderful stories. Now that I am older, I still appreciate the greatness of these moral stories in the Masters of the Universe world. I believe that this is a must watch for adults that grew up during its original airtime decade, but also for the kids now, who could learn and benefit from the ageless moral tales that make this box set and all of the classic box sets of He-Man great."
5,Love It!!!,Takes me back to when I was a child and watching it on VHS. I got my five year old daughter into liking them. I am glad to pass down classic cartoons to my children.
5,old cartoons,I can wathc this over and over these cartoons are the best. The ones that are out there now rare terriable! Very quick customer service and would recommend to anyone.
3,Not all characters pictured are included,"The 200 Edition does not contain either Mighty Mouse or Woody Woodpecker. What is printed on the cover is the same as the 600 edition. I only have this one. Since these characters are missing, I can only assume that they are only available on the larger 600 edition. I'm not sure who that frog is, most of these are before my time and I'm in my late forties. It's a good collection especially for the massive amount of Popeye and Gumby."
2,Title should be 30 classics and 170 piles of poo,Just another company making a buck on poor transfers of old public domain cartoons. Most of these cartoons look like they were captured off of youtube. Did not find any Woody Woodpecker cartoons on these dvd's. Also take note that the Tom and Jerry cartoons are the old Van Beuren B/W tunes that were renamed Dick and Larry so they wouldnt be confused with the classic cat and mouse.
3,Poor Packaging for 4 disks,Real bad packaging- ALL 4 discs are individually packed in individual paper sleves and stuffed together in the center of a dvd case. Seems to me that they will easily crack. I SENT ON TO MYSELF AND ONE AS A GIFT AND I WISHED I DIDN'T GIFT ONE.
5,A Wonderful Novel,"This book is so moving.It is written so beautifully. It is simply written, yet the message is so deep and so universal.It is haunting in a way.You can't put it down once you start it.It is a very quick read but the message says with you forever, pulling at your heart and gently urging you to-""remember this always"".Heartwrenching and inspirational- Highly recommended to all!!"
4,"Buddha Wept, a Novel of Terror and Transcendance","Having recently visited Cambodia, reading this short, beautiful novel was a perfect choice to continue learning about the tragic history of the Kmer people. Many Cambodians believe it is important to teach their children about the evil and destruction that Pol Pot, one of their own, created so that it never happens again. This novel really rang true to what we learned about and from the lovely Cambodian people we met. It made me feel like I was still there and I couldn't put it down. I highly reccommend this book if you are interested in learning more about the religion, history and people of Cambodia and SE Asia"
5,Inspirational!,"Buddha Wept is a beautifully written novel. An easy, thought provoking read. This story expounds on man's inhumanity to man and our own inherent ability to transcend even the most horrific circumstances. Those who challenge themselves to overcome themselves in life will understand and especially appreciate this book. Rocco LoBosco should keep putting out his message of resilience of character, it is much needed. Bravo!"
4,Good center Channel,For the price this is a good center channel in a small HT environment. the sound is surprisingly good for its size.
4,Nothing Special,"I was hoping this would be a bit of an upgrade to my little Panasonic speaker set, given the brand name, but I can't really tell any difference."
3,Small Sound from a Small Speaker,"Due to the purchase of a new LCD TV and stand, I had to replace my center speaker with one that would fit under the TV, a space about 5"" tall. The rest of my surround speakers are Polk, so I chose the 4"" tall Polk RM6752 center speaker. Unfortunately, the sound from this speaker is very tinny when compared to CS300 it replaced. After a month, I've become used to the difference in sound quality, but I know I've compromised. And, for the $75 price tag, I paid a premium for the privilege."
4,Inexpensive Center Channel Speaker,"The Polk RM6752 Center Channel Speaker is a good, inexpensive alternative to higher priced Polk units. I combined this unit with Polk bookshelf speakers that recommended a much more expensive center channel unit. In a room of modest size (12 x 15) it provides more than adequate sound with a 100 watt per channel receiver. The addition of the center channel increases the clarity of speech on tv and dvd's significantly. It also allows the left and right speakers to expand the sound stage to provide more three dimensional sound.The unit is well built and small enough to fit almost anywhere. It is not large enough to rest the TV on it, however."
5,Ultimate Alliance could give you hours of fun,"This game brings you action right after starting up... with great cinemas, strong villains and alternate missions for each superhero that are enough to keep you busy for a while. The story line is convincing and you need to meet many characters to bring new information useful during your adventure.I recommend you to enhance your hero defense prior to playing their missions. Also, explore very well each corner to find upgrades for your hero. A last advise, when you have the chance to change your 4 characters, select them very wisely, and do not change them again, because your team points are set to Zero each time you change a hero.Have fun with this 5 stars game.... :)"
5,Best game I own,"This was incredible fun the 1st couple times I played it years ago. I recently started playing it again putting each character on 1 of 5 ""permanent teams"" so I could her every single custom conversation the game has to offer. This game has lasting appeal & nice ""hidden nuggets of dialoge"" depending who you use where. I'm keeping a custom conversations chart so that years from now when I give it yet another chance, I can put the right people on the team on every level to maximize those custom conversations between charactors.I realized I hadn't given anything 5 stars yet so I decided to go back & review my favorite game of all time."
4,Marvel Geeks Unite!!,"If your a Marvel lover your going to love this game. I personaly liked it alot. The Good Side: This game has tons of characters from Spider-Man and Captain America to Ghost Rider and The Fantasic Four! And the same goes for the bad guys like Dr.Doom and Galactus! There are tons of costumes to chose from like classic outfits to new ones. Also the gaphics are great, I could see the scratches on Doom's mask! Now The Bad Side: The game's short, I beat it in two days. And it's also repetitive, once I was done with one level and I moved on to the next it felt like I was playing the same level. So that's my review I hoped you liked it. My final verdict: If you like the Marvel Universe (and who dosen't?) then buy the game if you not that into it then rent it, it'll save you the money."
4,Pretty cool game,"I love Marvel. This game is pretty good. You unlock characters and defeat villains. Too bad MUA 2 wasn't as good as the first (this one). BUT MUA 2 had Gambit, Psylocke, Jean Grey and Cyclops!! This one doesn't...Overall, both games are pretty good, but easy to beat. They both include awesome characters."
2,running around pressing the same button,okay i played this game with my sister spiderman doesnt even shoot webs i havent gotten far in the levels but it looks like a bite off x-men legends not fun at all
1,marvel boring alliance,"it's 2007 and THIS is what they come out with? my god, there's more gaming variety in super mario bros. 1!!!!!!! boring boring boring boring boring boring BORING. boring!!!!"
5,At last a solution we can live with!,"This book has changed the way my husband and I eat, forever! We sit down and actually spend time eating and talking together, enjoying the wonderful food Dr. Clower has taught us is healthful to eat. We love the cheeses, whole milk, butter, crusty breads, fruits and pastas that are encouraged in this book. I have lost 10 pounds so far (5 weeks) and know that is just the beginning. I just wish there were more recipies included in the book, because the ones I've made (from the book) have been a big hit. Also, I was a chocoholic big time and have found that a small piece of fine chocolate melted on the toungue satisfies completely...a secret shared by Dr. Clower. If you've ever torn through your cupboards desperate to find something sweet, or if you're tired of ""diets"" and ready for a delicious alternative with great results...order this book now!"
5,common sense,"I absolutely love this book! Really, it's common sense. Cut out the refined, chemical laden foods, stop mindless snacking and mindless eating and enjoy your food. So far I've lost about 5 pounds in a week, but the peace of mind and freedom from diet and food obsession is worth a million bucks! I can't recomend this book highly enough."
5,fat myth buster,"Love the book,so refreshing and so convincing,great, easy reading and understanding,extremly practical.Thank you french people for showing us how to enjoy life.Thanks to the author who courageously dismantles all those myths.Thank you for an enjoyable book that provides me with a better way of eating and loosing weight."
4,some good information,The book has alot of good information about processed foods. The all-purposed flour is processed and bleached. It probably isnt the same as the french.
1,Disappointing,"Not knowing all of Hugh's work, I purchased this ""best of"" collection not wanting to buy several albums at randon or trying to figure out which album (s) had those selections I wanted to own. With the excpetion of Stemale (cut 12) and Felicidade (and of course the well-known and great opening Grazing in the Grass), I was disappointed in the songs/tunes, finding them middle of the road jazz cuts without the real passion or standout trumpeting or passionate heartbeat of African music I sought. May be I expectations were too high, having listened for several years to Fela Kute."
5,Flight history,"First off, I must admit to some bias, because I'm a nephew of Floyd Henderson. The book includes a lot of photos -- some of which show my mother, Katherine Henderson, as a young woman.This book is a historical account of early aviation technology in the 1930's in the Midwest of USA, from one pilot's viewpoint. It portrays ""barnstorming"" in that era in great detail.I can only echo the comments of the previous reviewer. Floyd's son has done an excellent job of editing his father's memoirs, making this a valuable and readable book."
5,A Complex novel for a complex time.,"The Breaker Boys does a lot of things well. It gives us a glimpse of child labor in coal mining country, but it refuses to do so with grim drudgery. The boys of the story are still boys -- mischievious, rowdy, and passionate. It's a story about friendship -- the transforming power of friendship and the pain of it, as well. It's a coming of age story as the unpleasant son of well-to-do mine owners comes to understand both the immigrant mine workers and his own family of mine owners. Pat Hughes refuses to take the easy road where the workers are all good and the owners are evil. As a result, The Breaker Boys is a complex novel that will endure -- a story of family, duty, and maturity -- and an excellent addition to historical fiction of the time period."
1,"a great volume, but not content","This is really a book of great volume. But in no way that justifies its excellence.One beginner's book + Mr. Sutter or Meyer's book makes great choice instead, which is succinct, perspicacious, advanced and just-to-the-point.(I just changed my mind back to write this review - the reviews given above are just too misleading that I just could not help but write.)"
4,Not bad,This book is an excellent tutorial and reference. I will recommend to people who want to lern C++.
3,"Contrary to popular opinion, it's not a great book","The great C++ books are out there:+ Stroustrup: TC++PL+ Meyers: (More) Effective C++; Effective STL+ Sutter: (More) Exceptional C++ (Styles); The C++ Coding Standards+ ...This one is not! If you study the books listed above carefully, and then read this book, you'll realize things were not done using the best practice possible in this book, period. It's still a good book, just not great, not the best as the other comments had claimed.____Above comment on the 1st edition, now the 2nd:Still the same problems as in the 1st edition. The book is better named ""Unprofessional C++"" because it contains many+ technical inaccuracies and sometimes plainly wrong and misleading explanations+ old-time, prior to even C++98, bad practicesThe really high-quality and professional C++ books are mostly (if not all) published by Addison-Wesley.Most Wrox books are hastily assembled and unworthy of your money."
1,A good book with flaws,"I've had a basic knowledge of C for about 8 years or so, and used this book to learn the additions of C++ and the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. I feel that it has succeeded in teaching me everything I wanted to know about C++.One of the issues that bothers me is that, on several occasions, I find myself reading through a chapter and I'm told that I should read a much later chapter in order to understand the concepts being explained. If trying to get a well-rounded and complete education on C++, then I'm going to read the book cover-to-cover. I don't want to skip forward four chapters just to understand the paragraph that I'm on. This poor structuring of the book has resulted in at least a little frustration.I'm giving this one star to offset the 5-star review that one of the authors gave himself. Why would you do that?"
2,"For dummies, but they don't say so up front","This book is far too long for the information it contains. The authors went with a light, conversational tone, which is just plain annoying most of the time. When I buy a book like this, especially one that says its for experienced programmers, I want it to be straightforward, concise, and comprehensive. This is none of those things. I was able to get what I needed out of it, so it wasn't totally useless, but it could have been a lot more useful than it was.This just goes further to prove to me that if I can find an O'Reilly book on a subject, that's the one I should buy. I've never been disappointed in anything from that publisher."
1,Too much superficial coverage,"For a book of this size, I would have expected extensive coverage of key C++ concepts. However, I am very unsatisfied with this book, since the coverage of C++ is superficial at best. Too much space is wasted on aspects of software engineering. It seems every C++ topic is limited to 2 to 3 pages of glossing over; just when one is getting interested the topic ends prematurely. The treatments of the C++ library suffers the most, with language features only barely adequate.For example, the topic of C++ string is spread out over multiple disorganized chapters, which none of the chapters can do justice to this important topic."
4,For new and mature programmers,"Professional C++ is useful reading for both new and mature programmers. For the first group, this book offers a broad overview of useful aspects of C++, in a readable format. New programmers will learn powerful ways of using C++ before they have the chance to learn poor habits. For the second group, that is, programmers with comparable or more industry experience than the authors, this book offers the studied perspective of two of your peers on how to use C++ effectively. Many of us have had experiences from which we improve our coding abilities, but few of us have taken the time to study the problem of using C++ effectively in great depth. The mature programmer will appreciate the opportunity to find out what two of their peers -- who have studied precisely this problem -- think. If you combine reading this book with the proper reflection on your own programming experiences, style, and habits, you should walk away from Professional C++ a better programmer."
4,Decent C++ programming Guide,This is quite a readable C++ guide. The examples are simple and succint.It's a great guide for intermediate C++ programmers and also for Java programmershoping to wade into the C++ world.Also good to brush up on C++ if you have not used it for a while.I think the authors could expand a bit more on design patterns and templates and concurrency.
5,Excellent book,"I think this book is great for both learning C++ and as a reference. Having used C++ in some small projects, I thought I knew enough. However with this book I realized there were basic things that I did't know. With each chapter I read, I had a feeling that my knowledge of the language gets a big boost! The authors have done very good work in giving accurate -to the point- explanations that are brief and easy to understand. All the language features are well covered, object lifecycle, operator overloading, templates, exceptions, I/O ... etc. A very good book overall!"
1,This book was really bad.,"The Author was supposed to have been in the military for 20 years, and special forces for 13 of those years. However, there are so many mistakes, it is hard to believe he ever served in the military. For example, he has F-16 flying off a Navy Carrier. Only the Air Force flys F-16's, and not off of Aircraft Carriers. The Navy flys F-18's and F-14's, but not F- 16's. The lack of technical realism, combined with poor plot development, weak characters, and a good dose of woman hating ruined the book for me."
4,Entertaining,"I found this book to be captivating and hard to put down. It certainly slams the appropriate politicans that for 8 years jammed up the US military and put us in jeopardy for 0911/01.The family connections of the key players was a little hard to swallow, but it is hard to find good books about the Delta Force, and I enjoyed this one."
1,Nice while it worked,"I liked the drawer, programmable code, and key backup. But as another reviewer noted, mine also stopped working just shortly after the warranty ended. Even the key wouldn't open it. Luckily I was able to pry it open in about a minute."
1,Spend a few dollars more for a better safe,"If you think this is just like the Gun Vault, but cheaper, you're right about the ""cheaper"" part.This is a cheap metal box with cheap electronics and cheap, unreliable buttons.You don't have the option of defining a pattern that includes pressing two buttons simultaneously, which is important if you want fast access and better security against kids randomly pushing buttons until it opens.Imagine you wake up and believe there's an intruder in the next room, possibly armed.Is this what you want him to hear:beep beep beep beep beep-beep-beep dang itbeep beep beep beep beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-WHERE'S-beep-THAT-beep-DANG-beep-KEY-beep-beep...?"
3,goes beep and clunck when you open it,"For a gun safe in which to safely keep a pistol for ready access, it sure makes a lot of noise when opening it. Every key press makes a beep. Not loud but loud enough when the house is quite and an intruder is sneaking up the stairs. Then when the door opens it opens with a loud clunck sound unless you have the presence of mind to catch the door with the other hand. Cluncky but it is a safe and better than just keeping it in the drawer where some unauthorized person might get to it. I haven't had it long enough to tell if I like the features or not. It does take 8 AA batteries (not included) which seems like too many batteries to me. This is the same safe that the NRA is marketing for $89.95."
1,on the fence... won't be storing anything I need to quickly access during a stressful home invasion scenario.,"If I had paid for this Safe Vault I would be frustrated... as it is I'm looking at it with the viewpoint ""what now?"" A friend gave it to me used... I tried a few combinations now the thing has been screaming for 20 minutes (so much for the included paper stating it would reset in 3 minutes.). It took 5 minutes with a key to get the safe to open, then I had to slam it repeatedly to get it to close again. So... onward to remove the batteries ""for 30 minutes to allow reset."". That was a feat in of itself where I learned not to try restting the combination in which the screaming box changed pitch to a ""mad fury"" until I had the battery disconnected.So.. what now?I don't see being able to readily get into this box during a stressful home invasion. I'm more likely to store some less critical items we don't need often but need to be secured in the ""secure vault"" and get a ""gun vault"" instead."
1,Hate it. Very very disappointing book.,"Definitely NOT recommended for people who want to learn a lot of practical Japanese language in a short time. Despite the title, it seemed to me that the book requires a great deal of effort to learn a lot of random things very quickly in a sort of childish kindergarden way (""This is a key. That's a book.""), and definitely not in order of usefulness - why do I need to know how to say ""one trillion mechanical pencils"" before I learn toilet, passport, visa, taxi, bus stop, train station, train ticket, entrance, exit, ...? There is very little explanation - much of the material raises more questions than it answers, giving the student the feeling that they don't know how to use what they've learned except in the very few explicit examples given in the book.A very, very disappointing purchase."
4,Nihongo Away!,Dive right in and get to the point. Not light weight but not over bearing. Structured for advancing in the language for a wide skill set. Any person with a genuine interest can greatly benefit from this book.
4,very much business focuced,"This is a nice textbook used very widely, but the contexts are very focused on business. If contexts are more mixed, it would also be a good textbook even for high school students."
2,Reconsider before buying,"Not for the casual tourist who will vacation in Japan. Using this book, you will not learn the necessary phrases for a short trip to Japan. If you want to learn common phrases, do not buy this book. It was designed for serious students of the language.On that note, it is unbelievable that a text book of this caliber would be Romanized. If you are a serious student, then take this review seriously: learn hiragana immediately. Do not buy this book; buy the kana version of this book, and begin studying hiragana while you are waiting for it to arrive in the mail. If your college forces you to buy the Romanized version (like mine did), do future students a favor by requesting that they switch over to the kana version.Although my review of this book sounds harsh, do not be mislead. I like the Japanese for Busy People text book series, and, like all serious students of the Japanese language, despise Romanized books. Buy the kana version."
4,Very Useful for a TOTAL beginner.,"I think this book does a great job working with the business oriented very basic beginner. For my intents & purposes this book is fantastic - at this point, I'm not looking to have an in depth understanding of the language, I'm looking to be able to communicate just enough with Japanese speaking individuals. The book jumps right in with sentences and useful business phrases written in romaji (romanized writing of Japanese sounds/words) so that learning, understanding and speaking these phrases can begin immediately without having to learn the new alphabet. At this time, I am ""illiterate"" when it comes to Japanese (Kanji/Hiragana) but I can say enough phrases to get my point across. Should I desire to be able to read, write or better communicate, I would probably suggest a book that deals more thoroughly with the Japanese characters."
5,Accurate CD,"The speakers on the CD are accurate in the speed and flow of the Japanese language. For some people it may seem too fast, but that is the natural way that people speak in Japan."
1,All but a waste of money.,"In a nutshell:1. Wire came misaligned and cannot be realigned2. Wire is weak and can't cut through blocks of cheese thoroughly because it bends too much3. No replacement wires provided, must be special orderedBottom line: steer clear of this one"
1,Poor Quality Control,Unusable as received. Cutting wire was at an angle and not aligned with the cutting surface and associated groove. By a lot! Not something that could be fixed. I tried. Maybe this was an isolated event but I am sharing anyway.
5,Cheese Slicer by Prodyne,I love my Prodyne Cheese Slicer. The price is great and the quality in tops.I have had one for years and purchased some as gifts and another for myself.You can also get replacement parts from Prodyne for very reasonable costs.Set them out in different places for a party and the guest can slice their own treats.
4,Good but a little tricky,"This item is good for cutting cheese, esp. big block cheese. You need to watch the wire, though. If you push too hard and fast, the wire will kinda bend and you wont get a good, straight cut. So, you need to go slow and kinda guide the wire straight down. Once you get the hang of doing that it cuts big blocks of cheese perfectly.The only down side to the item is that you should not use it as a cutting board. Since its bamboo, it's soft wood and you can see the knife marks in the wood. My wife found out the hard way.Other than that, it's a good buy for the price."
3,Off a bit,I had purchased this for a science project and had only one problem. The wire was off to the side slightly so the handle does not come straight down and the wire does not fall into place. It also makes this horrid noise when used. I finished the science project and now my mom uses it in the kitchen. I guess it's okay for everyday use but I need to manually push the wire over.
3,After Long Awaiting This CD...It SUCKS,"Dont get me wrong, I LOVE the violent femmes , but waiting for this album to come out for about three months. When I listened to it and wasted my money on it I was very dissapointed. First of all most of it is recorded around the time of Why Do Birds Sing which is the femmes' worst album. Songs like Flamango Boy and Life Is A Scream are very sad.The only reason I gave this album a three is because of the very impressive version of Blister In The Sun. It is a great version and is the highlight of the cd. If you want a good live experiance from this terrific folk-rock band...go and see them live. Because even Viva Wisconsin, which has Guy Hoffman on drums sucks. The only reson is because Guy lacks energy and enthusiasm when playing drums. Hes boring and I still wander why Violent Femmes used him as a replacement for Victor. So actually dont buy anything with Guy drumming in it.Once again this album sucks dont buy it."
5,Brilliant,"The Poems of Saint John of the Cross is one of my all-time favorite books of poetry. If you want to understand the source of the writings of San Juan de la Cruz, you should read a bit of his history and the circumstances under which much of his poetry was written. It will amaze you."
1,awkward and inaccurate translation,If this translation were accurate but awkward it could still be useful. But even without knowing Spanish one can see that it is not faithful to the way of speaking. It does not show the parallel constructions when it could even without sacrificing the choice to rhyme. It adds images that are not there. It does not give the feeling.
1,The worst decorating book ever!,"I can't believe everyone else has rated this so highly. The ideas are not inspired at all, and everything still looks like junk--junky junk. There is one (one!) good idea in my opinion, and that is the coffee table made out of an old covered playpen. Unfortunately, the chances of finding such a playpen are zero to nil.The pictures don't help. The book design is too ""artsy"" and the ladies have placed numerous pictures of themselves doing ""funny"" things into it. A complete waste of space. There is not much information to be gained from the photos.Overall I was very disappointed with this book."
3,Decoratin Junk Market Style,Quite a bit the same info as the magazine articles before. No really new ideas
2,Not So Simple Stuff,"I recently reviewed this book for my ladies group. Some interesting things here, but the practicality of much of it all eludes me. While this may very well be a fun hobby for the 50-something authors (post-retirement perhaps), the costs for the average person to travel around the country to find some of this so-called junk - if one can even find some of it, combined with the costs of shipping it back to your home and then more costs to transform it into newer, improved pieces of junk seem quite prohibitive to me, and overly complicated I have to think. Since many of these items appear to have similarities to various items sold by Pottery Barn and other chic home boutiques, it would seem most practical to simply go this route and spare yourself all other hassles, time , and costs. Just an opinion from someone who bends toward keeping life as simple and uncomplicated as possible. Each to their way as they say."
2,Tiny Print - Waste of each page,"There is a huge top margin, as well as a huge bottom margin - and in between is this tiny printing. What a waste of paper. Not for anyone in need of reading glasses. Will have to get another one."
3,It's Okay.,"It was fine, just it didn't have the word pronouncations next to the meaning! Then my dogs ate it!Can't read too much of it anymore."
1,Amazon needs to have real-time inventory updates,"I order the shoes, and requested Express Delivery. The inventory said it was available, so I placed the order. I understand that this is not the fault of the seller but Amazon's 3rd Party Platform. I canceled the order after I received an email saying the inventory would not be available for a month after I ordered it."
5,JUST GREAT,"I found these diaper bags and started using them with my first. Now, I keep ordering them for my second. They are rather small but perfect for a few diapers at once really any size. I keep them by the bedside for changing, I carry them in my diaper bag and I even use them occasionally when we are out in the park and I am stuck with a bag for the dog. They smell nice, tie strong, and are just a life saver. Like someone else wrote, I also use them now instead of the expensive diaper contraptions.These are just great!"
4,"Small, Convenient, Works for Us!","Although it does have a strong powdery smell when you open the bag, it does the trick for my family and I when we need to dispose of the diaper and we're out of town. I don't really mind the smell too much but the bags are great!"
5,Excellent diaper bags also use for Doggie bags.,Love the diaper bags they really keep the bad smell a way. after you put the diaper in the bag you dont spell it anymore. the bags smell great. i also use them for my dogs when i pick up there poop. outside.A Excellent item to buy.
5,fabulous!,"These are a good price and so easy to use! They smell like baby powder, kinda strong, which is good to combat diaper odors! Highly recommend!"
4,Love these little bags for used kitty liter,We use these great little bags for used kitty litter. It is easy to scoop up the litter and deposit in these scented bags so it doesn't make the house smell before we take all the used litter to the trash bin outside. I don't give them 5 stars since they are difficult to get out of the box. They are supposed to pop up but we haven't had much success with that. The scent however is pleasant and they are easy to tie up. Overall we are pleased with these little bags.
5,great product,"I used to buy these at WalMart, but haven't been able to find them lately. They work great for keeping diaper odors away between emptyings of the trash can, adn they are also wonderful for traveling."
4,Favorable review,My mother uses this product to dispose of her colostomy pouches. She feels much more confident about traveling so I am happy with them. (I don't care for the baby powder scent but it is acceptable!)
2,"Should be biodegradable, doesn't hold smell that well","These don't work that great at keeping our kids poop smells at bay in the trash. I found that using a 13 gallon trash bag twisted around the diaper and then turned inside-out and twisted again then tied worked far better. You can get almost just as many uses from a pack of 75 13gal trash bags and they are so much cheaper (about $2). I say this because I had to double bag the sassy bags to actually control the smells. I'm no longer using these because I've switched to cloth diapers.Another bad thing is they aren't biodegradable, maybe they should change that."
2,Fragrance is gross,"I've been using these bags for over 3 years now. The bags themselves are fine, but the fragrance is just gross. Maybe I just got a bad batch this time, or maybe Sassy recently changed the fragrance? These bags used to have a nice baby powder fragrance, but this time they smelled like bug spray. Blech."
4,Pretty Good,"I purchased these bags twice intead of some type of expensive diaper genie. Super stinky diapers still need to be double bagged (like after baby starts to eat food), but overall I am happy with these."
4,Basic diaper disposal bags,Basic diaper disposal bags. Nothing glamorous about them. They just do the job. No offensive scents from the plastic. Easy to pull out of the box.
2,Not Powder Scented,"I've used these sacks before in a small 50-pack and really liked them. They had a very fresh baby powder scent and worked well for dirty diapers and spit up on outfits. This 200-pack smells totally different though. Instead of having that nice, light powder scent I liked so much, these smell like someone's perfume-doused granny. The box is labeled ""baby powder scented"" though, so I'm not sure why. I'll finish out the box because they are still useful, but I'm glad I'm not sitting beside the open box."
5,great bags!,These bags smell good and are good quality!! We have them at all the changing stations and in the car and baby bags as well!!
5,Love these diaper sacks!,"These diaper sacks are worth every penny. They smell great (which really helps with the extra dirty diapers), they are the perfect size, and they are incredibly convenient (we keep a box in three different rooms so we never have to hunt down a bag). They are perfect for home or travel, and you get tons of them for such a great price! I definitely recommend these over other diaper sacks that are available, you won't be disappointed!"
5,Helping the home environment :),Everyone knows how the diaper pail smells when the baby is eating all solids.... These bags help a lot woth that. I just use the bag on each pooped diaper. I used to use small trash bags - but they took up a lot of space in the diaper champ and it would fill up ahead of time.
3,Regular polythene with added fragrance,"When I was expecting, I had no clue what was needed and what was not needed. Based on many lists available in amazon and raving reviews of these disposable diaper sacks, I purchased 200 count box. I must have used about 20-30 bags in the first month. I slowly realized these were not needed at all.Now my son is 6 month old and his poop is no longer liquidy. I flush his poop and throw his diaper in normal trash. Trash goes out twice a week. We don't have any bad smell due to diaper accumulation.I still use these while i am out, only because I have it at home. Had I not had these, I would have used Ziploc in stead.At home, in the first month, I could have used regular polythene that keeps accumulating from grocery shopping. I don't feel any difference between the two, except for a pleasant odor. Both regular polythene and sassy sack will contain odor to an extent, the added pleasant odor doesn't really make much difference in odor control. $9 down the drain."
4,Good for diaper disposal,Was using the same product for long and bought it from AMZ. It is really good. Specially when you have infant and toddler with plenty of diapers to dispose everyday...
3,good for home,This product is great for the nursery if they're way out of the reach of your little one but not a great diaper bag item. The bags are not bundled or anything so that makes them a little difficult to use on the go not to mention potentially dangerous - random plastic bags are never safe around kiddos. I have another brand of diaper sacks that come in a roll and in a little carrier similar to dog poo bags so they're contained and attached (no stray bags just floating around the diaper bag)...it's much easier and safer.
3,Makes smelly diapers....a little less smelly,"These bags will contain the smell of dirty diapers a bit. It doesn't completely hide the scent, but definitely better than if you don't bag them at all. The bags do have a pleasant baby powder scent."
3,Nauseating scent,"These diapers do the trick and were a good deal, but I find the scent nausiating. I may be more sensitive to scents since I don't many scented items (lotions, detergents, dish soap) but the smell does not resemble baby powder to me. I do use baby powder on my child and the smells are not similar. nevertheless, they do a fine job and i found the size adequate."
3,SMALL,"I ordered these with the ""buy together"" feature on Amazon with a diaper pail and the Arm & Hammer whatever they are called. I ASSUMED these bags fit in the pail. They don't, they are for single use to throw a diaper away. They are OK, but man talk about adding even more non-biodegradable waist to landfills by individually wrapping each diaper to toss! They also don't pull out of the box very well. OK for the diaper bag I guess, but they are not for a diaper pail."
3,Scent too strong,"These are fine and strong and do the job, but the smell is so overpowering. After carrying them around in my bag, everything else in my bag took on the scent of the diaper sack. I will go for unscented next time."
2,The smell is quite powerful,"I bought these to use to clean out the litterbox; however, the powdery cloying scent is quite overpowering, even before the box is opened. I could smell it down the hall when the package arrived.The scent is mentioned in the product description, but I did not think it would be so strong and artificial. It almost coats your throat.That said, the bags serve their purpose - a bit smaller than anticipated, however. I will be seeking an alternative when these run out. Ironically, I keep these bags - which I use for kitty litter - in a large Ziploc bag to cut down on THEIR scent."
5,Fed up with Diaper Genie or Diaper Champ?? Try these Little Plastic Wonders!!!!!,"LOVE these! I buy like 5 boxes at time, and they last several months. They're so simple, and really work. Instead of using an annoying diaper pail that needs routine emptying and cleaning, just use a little scented blue baggie and immediately throw it in with other trash. That's one less trip when taking out the garbage! They're also great to take on the road. No more smell!!!"
2,these thin bags don't block smell and fail to mask it,"These bags are very, very thin. They can't block the diaper smell, so instead the company tried to cover up the diaper smell with a scent that is so strong I can't stand to leave the box open. The diaper smell eventually overpowers the scent because the bags are sooooo thin.In addition, the way the bags are placed in the box they don't pop up as you pull one out, so I'm always struggling to get another bag out as I'm handling a dirty diaper.For this product to really work well, the bags need to be much thicker so that the diaper smell is blocked NOT masked.The one nice thing about this product is the handle ties. They are easy to use."
5,"Love these, use them for cat litter!",The powder scent is great! Big enough bag to fit a scooper in. Way better than those bags they offer to fit in a little leash carrier for dogs. They are too small to fit the scooper in.
4,Sassy diapers sack,"These bags are great. They are handy to use, inexpensive and slightly perfumed. The only drawback (which is with all disposable bags) is that I have to use 2 of them for poopie diapers."
5,Love these bags,I used to buy these locally but they stopped selling them so I ordered a big box online. They are great for getting rid of dirty diapers while out and about or even for home use. We also use them for our dog.
5,Love them,"These work great! I use them when I babysit my nephew, and may just keep using them when I decide to have kids of my own! (Hopefully they will still be making them!) Cheaper than buying a special garbage can, and less conspicuous!"
5,Economical and efficient,"These little bags do the job perfectly. I can fit three ""size 1"" dirty diapers in each bag. I carry a few in baby's diaper bag too. Others have mentioned a strong smell to the bags but I have no idea what they're talking about. My nursery doesn't smell of plastic bags or diapers, and these have saved me from buying a costly diaper disposal system."
5,awesome!,I use these bags when traveling for a courteous way to dispose of my daughters diapers and they are wonderful! Light powder scent. Also good at home when you have a very dirty diaper that should go to the outside trash immediately. Great price as well.
5,The BEST diaper sacks!,"I have tried almost ever type of diaper sack on the market and these are by far the best ones. They completely hold the odor in. We use them everywhere, at home, on car trips, on vacation, at Grandma's house, etc. Would highly recommend them over any of the others!"
5,Sassy diaper bags,These are the best invention EVER! I have newborn twins and a diaper genie is way too small. These bags totally hide dirty diaper smells. I'll never be without these.
4,Good disposable diaper bags.,I love the baby powder smell and they hold a lot. The only draw back is it's hard to separate the plastic sheets o get the bag open.
3,Valley 1 1/4 hitch for 2007 Honda Odyessy,"I purchased the valley hitch for a Thule bike rack. The hitch installed easily. One hole needed to be drilled. The hitch is a straight type and not curved like shown in the photo. Even though, it does not show noticably when mounted to the car. I have also not hit any curves or drive ways with the hitch mounted. I am pleased with this product."
2,pretty but made badly,"this belly ring is really pretty but the daisy part is actually moveablei cant exactly explain it but it can only move front and back on the end of the bar. when i wear it the regular way it doesnt stay in place its just floppy, but when i wear it in reverse it holds still but its really large for a reversible belly ring. Ive seen my share of belly button rings this is different. But everyone has their own opinion , this is just mine. But ill keep getting belly rings from body candy i previously have and they have many nice ones."
4,great for little kids,"I recently got this for my 5 year old daughter. She loves games, and kicks everyone's but at tougher games like Monopoly. I am surprised at how much she loves this Cat and Mouse game, because there's not much to it. If you play by the rules it's over in three minutes. I find it boring, no strategy or even thinking, but the little one never tires of it. You can make your own rules to render it more interesting. It's a very high quality game structurally, Ravensburger is THE BEST QUALITY toy company. I highly recommend this toy as a first game for 3 or 4 year olds. I never would have bought it if I had played it first, but she gets such a kick out of it I'm not sorry we have it."
4,Fun game for the little ones,"This is a fun game with a random element that keeps it fun for little kids. The board has a giant cheese in the center with a top hole that you put your mice in - and they can drop out in 1 of 4 places. You move around the board and get chased by a cat as you do. Sometimes, you land on a square that puts you back at the top of the cheese and into the randomizer hole again. As you move along, you collect cheese pieces. The one with the most wins.It might get a bit boring for adults since it really is the same game each time. But young kids love it and it is something that the family can play easily for a game night. In all, I'm glad I got it. Our 7 year old loves it as much as her 3 year old nephew. And it's something they can play together."
3,Okay for young kids; boring for adults.,"We have 4 children ages 5, 6, 9 and 11. We purchased this for the younger kids who were then 2 and 4. It is a VERY durable game - heavy plastic pieces. It is great for small motor skills, counting, color recognition, etc. My son has the most fun putting the mice in the hole chutes and seeing which space they land on. That is the extent of the real fun. Otherwise this game is boring, drawn out and . . . painfully boring. Trying to remember to move the cat is a problem for us. Then when we do remember we are already 2 or 3 turns ahead and it is disappointing to know we have, in a sense, changed the game. The only one who asks to play is my youngest and he really just wants to use it as a playground for the mice."
5,Excellent Colonial History,"This is not just a superb telling of the story of the Regulator movement in preRevolutionary North Carolina, but rather a topnotch explanation of colonial economics, religiion and government as it applied in the South at that time. This book does for North Carolina what Rhys Isaac has done for Virginia in the same era. This book is for both the scholar and the novice. For those who feel the Revolution was due to simply ""No taxation without representation,"" please read this book. There is much more to the story of the Revolution and this book goes far toward explaining it."
3,Profs. Kars and Bouton,"The only reason I bought this book was because it is required for one of my classes taught by Dr. Bouton, who is mentioned in the acknowledgements. Dr. Kars is a professor, here at UMBC."
3,My Review on Kit's Wilderness,"In my opinion I thought Kit's Wilderness was a bit strange and quite hard to understand. It the beginning when it first introduces the game called ""Death"" and when it first introduces John Askew it was quite mysterious and made you want to read on. My favourite part was when Kit is drawn towards the pit to play the game called ""Death"" and when the knife spins and points at him he is the chosen one to see what it is really like to die. Also I thought it was good when Askew says to Kit that they are the same and things are yet to come. I thought that was spooky and that also made me want to read on. Towards the end of the book the story began to drag on a bit and in my opinion became a bit boring. Although, I think Almond finished the story well with the Askew family finially happy at last and John Askew becomes a good, changed person."
3,The review of kits wilderness,"I thought that this book was written well but isn't the type of books i like to read. This book is about a young boy called Kit. He moves to Stoneygate which is where the book is set. Since he moves there, he starts to learn about his ancestors and the horrifying pasts they led. He helped realise this with a dark secretive boy named John Askew.This book is very ghostly and is a spine thrilling book. It makes you carry on guessing as it is a bit of a cliffhanger. In it there is a game called death in which kit becomes the living dead. I think this book is good because it keeps you reading and guessing. This book is for 12-16 yrs of age. It is also a book for children who are interested in the dead and who are interested in the mines and their breathtaking pasts."
1,The book that sums up all the forgettability of literature!,"I had to read this partially in Literature class when I was a High School freshman, and let me tell you, I hate this stupid book! Like my title says, I found this the most forgettable book in all of literature! I don't remember ANYTHING good about this book, the characters I could not follow, the story I could not follow, it's just ridiculous! The only thing I do remember about this book is one point John Askew says ""You, he said. ""You, you!"" I was like ""No No No!"" this makes no sense at all! Kit was not asking a question so this just makes no sense at all! Personally this is a definite skip!"
2,Kit's wilderness,"This book is is about a boy who moves to Stoneygate, and his life gets turned upsidedown. he is called Kit Watson and the book is an adventure of him trying to settle into his new home.The book starts off with him moving to stoney gate, and him making friends with John Askew who intro-ducses the game of death to him. The game of death is where a group of children spin a knife and who ever it lands on gets to pretend that they are dead, but if you are woken up whilst playing the game you are ment to be the living dead, as Kit Watson finds out. Kit's problems begin to increase when his grampa gets seriously ill, and kit worries about him all the time. Then ghosts from the old mines where kit and his friends play the game of death, come to haunt him. They are children but one called silky looks after kit and his grampa like a gardian. You will have to read the book for your selfs if you want to know what happens."
3,My Review of Kit's Wilderness,I think that Kit's Wilderness was a very good book but it was very hard to follow all of the sub-plots and the main plot as they were all very complicated. Even so the plots were very good and quite enjoyable. David Almond uses a lot of detail when he writes which is very good as it helps the story to flow and sets the scene brilliantly.
4,revew of kit wilderness,"the basic plot of the story is about o boy called kit and he playes a game called death whith his firends he gets in lots of trouble but from there other things come into the story like jhon askew [the ring leader of the game death] and also his grandpa get very ill and diesin mid januery the story was set in stonygate [in the wilderness] my favrout charicter is kit and his grand pa because they are realyclose to each otherand the worst is jhon askew becase he is bossy, evel and not what you call a firend."
3,Kit's Wilderness Funky Review,"Kit's wilderness is riddled with darkness, fear and a complex knot of stories dating back to the old days when children were sent below the surface into the mines. It is set in Stoneygate, a village where it's history often comes back to haunt the residents of this small town.Kit is a young thirteen year-old who knows next to nothing about stoneygates history when he moves to the village after his Grandma died to live with his Grandpa. But Kit is soon dragged into an extraudinary game called death led by a mysterious boy called Askew.This book is ghostly and is guaranteed to make you curious about Kit's experience in the darkness of an abandoned drift mine. It's plot is witty and it's characters are strong, which makes this book a must-read."
3,kit's wilderness,"This was a very thrilling novel with unexpected consequences. When i first read this novel i decided it was a very good, well writen novel what you will not want to let go of! when you first veiw the book it gives no hint of bieng so dry but it picked up at the end. i thourghly enjoyed and read this book over a peroid of a lovely 2 weeks were i felt totally connected to the novel. This novel is about 2 boys called kit and askew and a little girl called allie keenan who venture into the caves of stoneygate were attacked buy thoughts and feelings like needing to save kits grampa from certian death!all in all this book was filled with evil gremlinsby adam wilkinson"
3,Not bad I suppose!!!,"This book is about a story of death, life and the bit in between. Christopher Watson and his family moved to stoneygate, an old mining town up north. To care for the recently widowed grandfather. Before long Kit is enticed into the game called death. Scary John Askew is the leader of the gang who played death. In the end kit saves the day and make everyone happy"
3,Kit's Wilderness: The Oddysee Through My Eyes,"Kit's Wilderness is a intriguing book that includes more than 1 plot. It tells the story of 13 year old Kit who moves back to his birthplace, Stoney Gate. This was the place where his GranDad grew up and worked in the coal mines as a young man. He meets the likes of John Askew and his friends. Askew tells Kit that they are both closer to each other than they think. Askew invites kit to his cave he dug out. There Kit learns to play the game called Death. I think that it is a good book because Almonde uses more than 1 plot so it makes the book much more interesting."
3,Kits Wilderness review,"Kits Wilderness is a story set in Stoney gate. Stoney Gate is a old mineing village. The children there played in the mines and they had a game called Death. The game got found out and it was stopped.My favoirt charcteris Allie because she has a good personallity and sounds like a fun person to be around. My least favorit charcter is John's Father because he is a nasty man who isn't very nice, but he gets better through the book.I think that the most effictive parts of the book are when Kit's Grandad is telling his stories. The least effictive parts of the book are when they are at school.If i could change a part of the book i would change it so it doesn't end so quickly.I would recomend this book to others because it is an enjoyable book to read."
3,Kit's Wilderness,"The story of Kit's Wilderness has an exciting storyline and is cleverly written by Almond.It is set in Stoney Gate. Two main boys play a game called death, with other freinds, Kit gets chosen and then killed but is awoken. There is an interesting ending but I think it could have been explained a bit more. I think when the two boys are down the mine and kit is talking about Lak it is very effective. I will look out for more Almond stories and I think others should too!"
3,Kit's Wilderness By David Almonds,It is set in a villiage called Stoney Gate. It is basically about a game called death which is played by the children in the village John Askew Kit Watson and Allie Keenan.Kit is my favourite charactor because he is the main charactor and i like the relationship between him and his Grandfather. Allie is my least favourite charactor because i don't like bossy people and the way she dresses. Lest effective part was when grandpa goes to hospital.Most effective when Askew takes Kit into the Wlderness once more. I would not change any of the book i like it all. I was happy with the ending i likehow it brought everyone together to be friends
4,kit wilderness the book,"I thought the book was very good.strange but not ordinary.GIt is very haunting and quite freaky. i also found it exciting and it made me read every page.this book was a reader.my favourite part was at the end where it was christmas and everyone became friends.i know that as long as there are others to see us, we will walk here together forever."
2,kit's wilderness,kit's wilderness is a great book but not for young ones as it is quite a hard book to get the jist of. But still it will definitly apeal for people looking for a great read and a book which keeps you tence all the way through.
2,kits wilderness,"Kits wilderness is one of the wierdest books i've ever read! I don't think it has a storyline or a genre either. It is not an adventure, its not a magical or fantasy story, it really puzzled me. The story starts off when Kit watson moves to Stonygate were his family used to live. He meets John Askew(he's crazy). Who intro duceces him to the ""dangerous"" game of death which starts this tale of mystery. Kits problems increase when his grandpa becomes ill and reflects a new bunch of problems for Kit. The goasts of the past come to haunt him, like people from his stories and outhers. basicly this book is crazy, don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Very Boring,Don't waste your money. This book is not worth it.E-Mail me if you disagree: EliteCat@hotmail.com
1,THIS BOOK SUX!,"I did not like this craphead book at all. I was not excited to pick it up and could not find myself getting hooked in its non-existant story line. The characters were unrealistic and undeveloped. Is""Kit"" a good guy or a bad guy? You just can't root for him throughout the story because he is just an unfinished sketch on a chewed up piece of paper."
3,Lacking sparkle,"I like Chris -- I've seen him a number of times, first time in a dump South of Market in San Francisco about twenty-two years ago, and most recently about a month ago. I own plenty of his music. My negative comments aren't about the performer, but the production.This show feels flat and contrived to me, and it looks to me like Chris feels the same way. It's sanitized and homogenized, ""made for TV"", and it lacks the loose, humourous punch that I've always found at his live shows. Pity. It's just ... flat."
5,Much Like Seeing Chris Live,This Blu-ray captures a Chris Isaak show very well. I have seen Chris numerous times and this is a very solid performance of a good (if not predictable) playlist. The sound reproduction is excellent; the camera shot selections were generally good. My only criticism is that there is some bleed on the video images where blue stage lighting appears to obscure facial features. All in all a great video that can be watched/listened to numerous times.
1,Defective DVD,"Would have loved to have watched Chris but the DVD was defective; it would not play in either a DVD player nor computer. The main menu had sound but both concerts were silent. My computer indicated the DVD has an ""unsupported audio format."""
5,Great Sound!!,"My girlfriend told me to buy this after I revamped my sound system. I never heard of the guy, but whoah.. he has a great sound and a unique (somewhat cocky) style. Its got two concerts, the first one is better than the second... primarily because the sound is very high quality and rocks the house. I love it... one of my favorites. Soundstage did a good job on this one."
5,Favorite of all time,My favorite book ever. I reread it every few years and love it every time. I have several copies just so I can have one on every bookshelf.
5,Excellent adventure!,"Truly outstanding adventure plot that is easy to follow and fun to believe in; a loveable heroine with gumption; a touch of romance and the mystical; and excellent writing! Although this was written before its prequel, The Hero and the Crown, read the prequel first so you can enjoy the flashbacks and references to the prequel. It does move a bit slower than The Hero and the Crown, but stick with it - you'll be glad you did."
5,The Blue Sword,"This book is undoubtedly my favorite. It has all the things I look for in a book. There is fantasy, honor, trust, and love. though I dont usually go for the mushy books this one really cought my attention. I actually searched for three years to find a copy of this book for myself. It's just that good."
3,A Good Read,"I enjoyed reading this book very much. It's a fun, unique story and I would definitely like to see more of this world. However, the ending seemed a bit rushed, and I had to read the climax again to make sure I hadn't missed something. I really liked the main character, though, and I liked the interesting take on magic. I will definitely be reading this again!"
5,A fanatastic read!,The Blue Sword is a wonderful and entrancing fantasy about a young woman who finds herself in a odd circumstance. I started reading this to my daughter and have reread the book at least 5 more times for myself since then. The book is a great read every time I sit down with it. The only problem is I can't put it down!
5,The book that made me fall in love with reading,"I picked this up at a bookstore as a horse crazy kid back when it first came out because of the cover art. I read it straight through and then proceeded to read it over and over and over again until it turned to dust. It was the first book I'd ever fallen in love with, and as my first, has a special place in my heart and in my library (third copy does anyway). I highly recommend it. I can't say enough good things about. Read it."
2,"Ugh. Pat story, anyone?","I don't understand why I can't enjoy Robin McKinley's novels more. Somehow, no matter how many I read, none of them really grab me. The same goes for The Blue Sword. Nothing impressed me at all.The characters seem remote, the writing is remote, too many fantastic and unbelievable things happen, there is no real fear that the good guys won't win and there'll be a happy ending; everything about this book disappointed me. Robin McKinely seemed to be very confused, impatient, and distracted when she wrote this one. The plot was pat and the characters, well, I already complained about that.Suffice it to say, this book left me cold. As do, surprisingly and a little strangely, almost all of McKinley's stuff, which is such a shock to everyone, seeing as she is so beloved."
5,It always draws me into its world,"When life in this world gets completely discouraging, and I want to escape, the world of Robin McKinley's Blue Sword is my destination. She has created a story with fascinating, three-dimensional characters who speak a language that is alien at first, but by the end of the novel, the reader feels fluent. Harry Crewe, the heroine, is abducted from her hum-drum life and cast into an adventurous, passionate and magical culture. After a series of events that reveal a magical element within herself, Harry casts her lot with those of her benevolent captors, and their battle becomes her own. It is an exciting, heart-stirring journey that gives me hope every time I read it."
2,Disappointed,"I failed to get drawn into this story, and I love books about magic and strange lands. There was no real emotion surrounding the main character who gets kidnapped and eventually married by a ""foreign"" King--no sense of panic, no culture shock, I wasn't ""with"" her or drawn into her adventures or emotions. There were many boring parts I just skimmed, but didn't fail to notice much that didn't make sense, both in the writing and in the plot. For a REALLY good fantasy/adventure, read Philip Pullman's trilogy, starting with The Golden Compass."
3,Well written story with a disappointing ending...,"Harry Crewe, an orphan living in a desert manor, is stolen away by a band of desert nomads to fulfill her ""destiny""-to wield the legendary Blue Sword and defeat the vicious Northern Army.Although set in a well developed culture, the ending seemed a result of the ""happily-ever-after syndrome""-authors feel that they must follow stereotypical fantasy ending rather than follow what would have really happened had the story actually occured. The ending event seemed rather gratuitous and complusory. There was no indication of the event in the storyline. The age diference between those two charactors is also unbelievable.A well written book, but a let-down of an ending. Worth reading, but don't expect too much."
2,Dull and far from believable,"I noticed this book is ranked in the on-line top 100 fantasy and sci fi books of all time. I really wonder who voted for it. The book is basically an adolescent fantasy where everyone lives happily ever after. The characters are flat, the world stereotyped (it's basically a poor take off of Frank Herbert's Dune) and Harry Crewe the superhero is totally unbelievable. I mean, how believable is it that a poor orphan girl who has never held a sword in her hand in her life, and is only a passable horserider, could become, in two months time, a swordsman on par with Conan who can ride like the Lone Ranger? Not to mention that she suddenly becomes endowed with the magical power of Gandalf and can see the future and start localized earthquakes. Although the authoress Robin McKinley has written several books before this one, it has the feel of a first novel. If it were just that, I could excuse McKinley, but as it stands...well, I'll pass. Oh yeah, and it was boring, too."
2,Heard This Before,"Throughout this book, McKinley gives the impression that the unfolding events are somehow inevitable. The main character does not have any real choices to make because she is led by some mystical force. This impression never leaves the reader -- even when we see the main character make a ""surprising"" choice. In the back of our minds we know that she was supposed to do this. We don't worry about the result because she'll be alright. No real danger ... no real peril ... ZZZZ.It's not that McKinley is writing in the spirit of Tolkien or Herbert -- she's rehashing their stuff. Did you wonder, around the middle of the book, if you had heard some of this before? You had. The bad guys resemble orcs (at least the minimal descriptions you get at the end) and the good guys resemble Fremen. This reader prefers a fresh story."
1,THE BLUE SWORD-ROBIN McKINLEY,"Harry Crewe just moved into the orange-growing country of Daria. But when she sees Corlath, the Hillfolk king, she knows she belongs with them. Corlath kidnaps her because he realized it too, and brings her on their journey to defeat the evil that waits across the hills. Only then will Harry realize that she is destined to carry the Blue Sword, Gonturan, and defeat the evil.A horrible book! The metaphors are likely to make you cringe, and the dialogue VERY run-on. A great plot idea, but a horrible way to do it! But don't give up on Robin McKinley, the sequel to this, ""The Hero and the Crown"", was absolutely FABULOUS!"
4,"A little boring, but there are a few juicy facts.","At the beginning of this book, I almost gave up reading it altogether! It was suck a bore. But as I got deeper into the story it became very interesting. If you have little patitence, STAY AWAY from this book! The Blue Sword is the sort of book that gradually brings you into it.It throws more curve balls than you can predict. Before you consider reading this book, read The Hero and The Crown, which is the ""lead on"" to The Blue Sword. Saddly I made the mistake of reading The Blue Sword first, and didn't get the sturdy backround of the story to enjoy it as well."
5,Fantastic!,"Well, after reading a lot of fantasy books, I find this has satisfied my fastidious pickings. It is a MUST for all fantasy readers. It has a mix of everything and most of all it has a female herorine!! =0)"
4,If you like fiction stories with lots of action adventure and romance you'll love this book,"Have you ever read a book that is boring in the beginning but seems like the best book ever at the end? This book is one of those books with nothing much in the beginning but you'll be paid off in at the end so much. You'll just have to see what happens when enemies band together to fend of the shared enemies of both! Harry Potter books are kind of like this. It will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. In other words, if you like books like the movie King Kong you will love this book."
5,One of My Favorites.,"This book was amazingly wonderful to read. I think I even got a detention for reading it in class, I just couldn't put it down (the detention was worth it!!). I do not want to explain the whole story and say what happens, blah blah, you have the summary on the book for a glimpse of what it contains, so I won't repeat.What I will say is that if you like fantasy, brave heroines, and romance (NOT the overly mushy kind either!!), with it's own blend of humor and adventure, you will definitely love this book. McKinley takes a setting and turns it into something so exotic and captivating I find myself almost wishing that I wasn't so absorbed and that I could read this book in the span of a year, so that it would NEVER end! She creates magnificent cultures and beauty and it is just so amazing. You will love it. I promise you!I have re-read this book like five times over, and still whenever someone asks what my favorite fantasy book was I'd say The Blue Sword. READ IT!!!"
5,Wonderful epic-fairytale quality,"Her words spin a gossamer epic, with wonderful characters and an introspective hero. If you have not read this book, no matter how old you are, you should!"
5,An Excellent Fantasy Book,"This book was excellent. It details the story of young Harry Crewe, stolen from her home by the natives of Damar. Out in the desert, she finds she has a special destiny...I really liked this book. The author really does well writing it."
5,A Fantastic Tale,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. I am quite the avid reader and normally devour a three hundred page book in a couple of hours. McKinley's The Blue Sword was one book that I tried to read as slowly as possible. I didn't want it to end! Harry's transformation into Harimad-sol and the inevitable romance was fantastic.This book is on my wishlist. I borrowed it from the local library and wanted to cry when I returned it. It is a fantastic novel. If you're looking for a great story with a strong heroine, a mystical land that bears eerie similarity to our own world (I won't tell you which ethnicity it reminds ME of though...you can draw your own conclusion), and a fantasy that will take you away, GET THIS BOOK!By the way, I also recommend her retelling of Beauty and the Beast. ;-)"
2,"Boring, predictable","The most interesting characters where the cat and the horse, you never got to truly ""know"" any of the others or what made them tick, you knew from the first mention of a great-grandmother with a past in the first chapter exactly what was going to happen."
3,Follow up to the Hero & the Crown,After reading the Hero and the Crown I think my expectations of this book were very high. I was disappointed that it didnt capture my heart as the first one did. But over all I think it was a good book and I enjoyed it.
5,A Keeper.,"I've owned my copy since it first came out in paperback. I am in my early 40's and still enjoy rereading this book and the sequel, ""The Hero and the Crown."" I never skip a page, which I am inclined to do when I reach boring parts in a frequently reread book. Harry is a heroine who doesn't waste time bemoaning her fate, but makes the best of things she doesn't understand. Damaria is a land I wish I could visit. Need a new copy desparately."
4,"This book was action packed, and full of suspense!","I loved this book, because it was full of action, suspense, and even some romance. Harry was the heroin, who saved her country with the help of an amazing blue sword, a gracious king, and some magical powers she found along the way. The book kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, waiting for what would happen next."
5,Another wonderful McKinley novel,"An exciting, involving adventure, set in a richly textured country and culture. All the characters, even the very minor ones, are well-drawn and distinct. While Harry's training and adventures are the backbone of the story, the basic conflict has more to do with culture clashes than with battling demons. Harry's struggle to reconcile the two sides of her heritage is one that many people can identify with. The romance that develops between the equally strong-willed Harry and Corlath is believably conflicted, yet beautifully romantic."
5,Not Only About Orange Juice,"The first time I started the book, my sister got it out on tape and we listened to it in the car. I stoped listening because it sounded like it was about orange jucie. When I read other Robin McKinley books in seventh grade, I picked ""The Blue Sword"" up again. I admit I had to push my way through the first few chapters, but after thaat I couldn't put it down. All the characters are so likable. I enjoyed this book so much I had to go and buy my own copy just so other people could read the library's copy. This is a great book."
5,Enchanting Setting,"This books makes me crave the Damarian desert and the lands Harry and Corlath traverse. I want to live there and experience all the ""flavors"" of the land.The story is beautiful, filled with a kidnapper's guilt, and Harry's uncertainty about her past/future and new-found happiness. A book with an empowered female and a wondrous magical land, I recommend this book to anyone and of any age."
5,read this book!,"I read this book for the first time three years ago, and bought it recently. I would say it is one of the best books I've ever read. I would definatley recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. It is an amazing story of a girl who lives a life much like ours, until her father dies. She is shipped off to live in a colony in the country of Daria, called Damar by its natives. Whan the native king comes to negotiate with her foster father, he sees her for what she is: an extrodinarily gifted girl who could someday save his country. He kidnaps her, and that begins an adventure like no other, in which Harry (that's her name) must realize who and what she is, and accept her destiny.Read this book! It is a definate must-have! You might want to read ""The Hero and the Crown"" first, though. It is prequel, and has a lot of important info."
5,The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley is Awesome!,"This is a totally awesome book. I could not put it down, it's really cool. OK now that i've got that out of my system... This is a really good book. I recommend reading The Hero and the Crown first, though. This book is less dark than the Hero and the Crown. I think it would make a good movie, but some of the FANTASY-TYPE stuff would make that sort of hard...ie, visions, languages (I really hate subtitles), etc. In short it had romance, adventure, magic, and it doesn't leave you hanging or saying, ""Stupid."" at the end. It's about a girl named Harry (don't laugh) who comes to Damar and becomes....You thought I was gonna tell you huh? Read it"
4,"Good, but I liked Hero and the Crown better","I've been making up for some gaps in my young adult reading, and Robin McKinley's books seemed a must. I read The Hero and the Crown first, knowing that it was written after The Blue Sword, but chronologically first. Having done so, I don't have much advice -- I'm not sure if I did it the right way or not -- this is a similar dilemma as that of reading the Narnia Chronicles (do you read them chronologically or in the order they were written?). Perhaps, ideally, you would do both. In any case, I enjoyed The Blue Sword immensely, but definitely feel that The Hero and the Crown is a better book. The characters seem more solid, the plot is more mature. Regardless, both of these books should be a must on any y.a. fantasy reader's list. Also recommended are Lloyd Alexander, Madeline L'Engle, and Sabriel by Garth Nix. What a way to stay young at heart!"
1,Shipped 3 times all wrong,I ordered two new Wagner disk brake rotors from Amazon. The first shipment arrived quickly but upon opening the package I find one very used rotor and one new one. I sent the used rotor back and they replaced it with the wrong rotor. I sent that back and they replaced it with according to Wagner(I checked with them) a counterfeit rotor. At that point I sent back both rotors. The folks at Amazon were very good about trying to resolve the issue and refunded all my money. I will use Amazon again for that reason. I understand some suppliers to Amazon may not be what they should and I don't fault Amazon for this because they can't police every one of the thousands of suppliers they use. In the end the only cost to me was time but as we all know time is money.
5,A Sight for Sore Eyes is wonderful,"Ruth Rendell is such a great author. I love this book because it was so interesting and suspenseful. You know something is going to happen, but that's as far as you can go without finishing the read."
3,Disappointing,"For any other author, this book might rate another star, but Ruth Rendell is fabulous and this book isn't.Although Rendell always gets into the heads of some very strange people, somehow, these folks just weren't believable. Strangely enough, it was because they were, in a way, innocuous considering the level of their sickness. It was difficult to get upset about Teddy's murders (or death) since it all seemed incredibly easy. Just go nite-nite and don't wake up. And I couldn't figure Julia out at all. Why did she deteriorate like that? And to lock Francine in her room as the ultimate act of insanity...gasp! A far cry from Rendell's usual convoluted motivations and plot."
2,Too much backstory,"This was my first Ruth Rendell novel. I picked it up after seeing her name appear with very high praise on a list of top psychological thriller reads.Based on this novel, I'd call her more of a literary fiction mystery writer. The action doesn't really pick up until the half-way point in the book, but then steadily increases to the strong ending.I rated the book so low because I thought too much of the book (likely half) was superfluous narration to fill in the main characters's history. I think I could have understood the position of both main characters without so much detail.If it hadn't been for the list of thrillers to read, I might not have finished the book. It began without a ""hook"", prompting me to read on, but I kept thinking that there must be more if she is such a prominent author.Some day I might try another Rendell/Vine novel, but I'd make sure it came with plenty of hot reviews and a quicker pace."
2,Don't spend your money - check it out from the library,"I've never read Ruth Rendell, but bought it because a)there were positive reviews from customers and b)it was 50% off. Well, unfortunately, I was not impressed at all with the ""story"" (if you can call it one). Nothing about the characters interested or endeared me to them and made me care what happened. I ended up skimming over much of the latter third of the book. Unfortunately for me, this was my first and possibly last Ruth Rendell book. Nothing about it makes me curious to read any other of her books."
1,Weird book about extremely strange people,I read this book for my book group and did finish it. If it were not for the book group I would have trashed it after the first couple of chapters. I cannot believe anyones imagination can come up with all that happened in this book.
1,VERY BAD,I have read or listened to most of Ruth Rendell's books. This is absolutely the worst book I have read. I didn't bother finishing it. Maybe it was just an off year for Ms. Rendall. I hope so.
2,"Unsavory characters, inept psychology","I grow weary of Ms Rendell's inept psychology. She limns interesting situations but her understanding of human psychology (and in this case, the psychology of childhood trauma) so badly that it makes the journey painful for anyone familiar with these things."
5,She's Done It Again,"Rendell takes on the difficult task of trying to let the reader understand the workings of a cold, twisted, and almost inhuman mind--and she does it brilliantly. Teddy Brex is not a likeable character, but he's a bit like Patricia Highsmith's Talented Mr. Ripley--I found myself empathizing, if not exactly sympathizing with him. It's an extraordinary portrait of a character, and an unexpected bonus is that for suspense, it has some mordantly funny parts--when Teddy, trying to be inconspicuous, finds himself burdened with a corpse in a yellow Edsel, it's a uniquely Rendell situation. All the characters are intriguing, but it's Teddy who's haunting."
2,A Sight for Sore Eyes,"Ruth Rendel is a master at familiarizing one with a character and then subtly surprising the reader with plot developments. It is only at the conclusion that one realizes how neatly all the little events affect each other and the characters. The reader simply gets drawn in, deeper and deeper. Such skillful writing!"
3,Why should the reader care?,"Rendell is a very talented writer and her ability to put the reader in a character's head and set a scene are top-notch. But the characters in A Sight For Sore Eyes are not appealing. I just did not care about most of the characters or what happens to them. So, as well-written as the book is, the story and its characters fail to deliver. I expect that for fans of Rendell, Sore Eyes is a book that should be read. But for most of those looking for a compelling and entertaining thriller, my advice would be to keep looking."
4,Much more than a thriller,"Ruth Rendell's bestseller offers much more than a conventional thriller, though it is that as well. The long but captivating character exposition at the beginning and the unexpected ending, indeed, make this as much a psychological drama as a conventional crime-writing piece. As little as possible is best betrayed of the plot, but Francine, our young and virtuous heroine, is at risk from the attentions of multiple twisted individuals, including an evil step-mother and an admirer with a sinister bent. A Sight for Sore Eyes might in this sense qualify as a twentieth-century spoof of a Victorian novel. But it is much more and, while this is a page-turner, it deserves to be read slowly for its grim humour, social analysis, and fine descriptive material. I look forward to reading more of Rendell's books."
4,An engaging literate mystery,"What is refreshing in Ruth Rendell's mysteries is that the whodunnit aspect is sacrificed for a more literate appraisal that makes the reader instead ask why such deeds are done. This book took a great risk in getting the story line going by opting to introduce the reader to three different casts of characters, rather than by sudden death. The result is that when mayhem occurs, and of course it does, the logical consequence of the action is what draws the readers attention to page after page of pitch perfect prose. Cliche, but true: I read the book in only two or three sittings. Loved it."
2,It all adds up to nothing,"The strength of this book is the characterizations, and all of the characters are unlikeable. I couldn't find myself caring about what happened to them. Usually Rendell is good at making unbelievable situations believable, but the plot in this novel was that of a second-rate potboiler. At the end of the book, I had the feeling, 'is that it?', which is not my usual reaction to Rendell's works. A real disappointment."
1,Too creepy for me,"This is the last Ruth Rendell book I will read. I should have remembered how much I disliked Live Flesh before buying this one. The ominous tone, ugly people and an unpleasant ending make me wish I hadn't wasted my time or money."
2,Don't waste your time,"If this book is the best Ruth Rendell has to offer, then I think I'll pass on the rest. The book was very descriptive, but was lacking a real plot. The characters had a lot of potential, but never followed through. To me, the time spent reading this book was wasted."
5,One of her best,"When Francine Hill listened to her mother's murder when just a small child, the shock caused her to become mute. She recovered after extensive therapy from Julia who eventually married Francine's father making her Francine's full time carer, an occupation which turned into an obsessively protective cocoon. Teddy Grez was the product of a completely non-nuturing childhood with his parents and uncle totally ignoring him, with the reult that this handsome young man became excessively slf absorbed and unable to relate to others. When the beautiful Francine met the handsome Teddy, the attraction was instantaneous and, on Teddy's part, all encompassing, with tragic and frightening results. This has been my favourite Ruth Rendell to date with all of her psycopathic characters and their bizarre compulsions terrifying to say the least!"
1,Only for children under 3,"Caillou Magic Playhouse is very disappointing. The pictures are cute but the games are not challenging. This item says that it is for a 2-6 year old but all except one of the activities is for a child of 2 or younger. My daughter is 3 checked out all the games and except for a run of the mill advanced reading and math game could do all of the games on their hardest settings the first time. She immediately declared this game boring after the first and only time she played with it. Games like Freddie Fish, Madeline and many others she is still playing with after many months because they have challenges, which grow with the child's ability. For example the matching game in Caillou only goes up to 10 pictures which is 5 pairs. A good game, which is challenging would have more pairs as an option. Don't buy this game."
1,No Value in this title,This game was vey disappointing for both me and my 3 year old. There isn't a whole lot of content here. The games are poor and my child is bored with them after only one session. The games reminded me of a macromedia-flash game that you would find on kids' web sites. This one was rushed to the shelves.
5,3 Year Old Loves it Again and Again and Again,Bought this product for my 3 yr old (who also loves the show). The gaming level is perfect for her. It is teaching her valuable logic as well as computer skills. She has played it for over 10 hours already! Beats a video any time. I am going to buy Caillou Birthday on her birthday.
2,Cailliou On Computer,"Cailliou Magic Playhouse has its ups and downs.For starters, it has the features and cuteness of the cartoon on PBSkids but not reaching the point that other preschool games reach that keep them playing for hours.Ciallou has the game strategies that your young one needs but they outgrow it and get bored of it faster than your average preschool game.All in all,if you want a game on the preschool level,the Fisher Price (Petshop or Rescue Heros for example)are a better educational and imaginative choice.It meets the requirements kids need and kids even above their age range appriciate the games as well as within the range of 3-6 for the range printed on the box's sake."
1,Horrible!,I purchased this game for my 3 year old. She loves the Reader Rabbit games and is very good at them. I wanted to get her something new so I got her this and its very over her head. It's more narration than playing and the characters do more talking than there is playing. The disc also freezes and has errors and if she hits the quit button which is a bright red stop sign it completely closes the game all together. She clicks it all the time thinking she just wants to get out of the current game she is in. I would not recommend it.
2,"Great quality print, bad seller.","Great quality printed item looks very good and striking. A word of warning however, is that it was badly packaged and therefore arrived damaged losing a lot of its effect. Seller did refund order but after a very long wait (over a week late) it did lose some of its magic."
4,Sweet thing for a sweet price,This yoyo is pretty awsome I am a inermideat/beginner yoyoer and I can do a lot of tricks with this thing. You can get it to sleep for about 30 seconds wich is really good for 4 dollars!!!!!!!! I think that all beginners and intermedeat players should get it and/or the combo with the brain for only 10 dollars!!!!!!!!!!!! Definatly a great buy!!!111 BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Humidifier Wick,They do the job even with our very hard water.I have been able to use only one all winter.
5,AC-801 Duracraft Humidifier Wick Filter (3 Pack) ~ Great find!,"These AC-801 Duracraft Humidifier Wick Filter (3 Pack) arrived promptly, and work in our downstairs humidifier and lasted for the whole season."
1,Please don't read this!!!!1,Let me first say that this book was terrible! I love to read mysteries and thrillers but this was so boring. I read the reviews and thought this was going to be a good book. I think they all lied because it was boring from beginging to end. I strongly urge you to reconsider reading this
3,Just OK,"Given the low cost this is a decent quick read. I just got my Kindle and downloaded a bunch of free or low cost books. Since I like Robin Cook, I tried this. No comparison, but not a bad choice."
3,Syndrome,"With the era of bioethics ever present and burgeoning, this book is a bit on the light side. However it does speak to the American need to remain young, at any cost. I too noticed lots of typos with the Kindle edition but that is neither here nor there. Stem cell research is extremely controversial which is unfortunate since it may well turn out to be a life saving source with many conditions and diseases."
2,good science but superficial,The plot of the book is a good idea but the story unfolded too neatly and the characters did not behave in a logical manner which made them less believable. The characters often did and said things that were out of character. This book relied on too many coincidences in order to progress the storyline and often these coincidences seemed unnecessary. The science was interesting and that helped the book alot.
4,enjoyable medical thriller,Being in the medical field I am drawn to books like syndrome. With stem cell research on the rise the what if applications are stunning. There's also the what can go wrong factor which is the premise of the book.Its a fast paced book that is not totally based on known fact but given the setting it doesn't need to be really. It does give the sad feeling of knowing that the concept of shady practices isn't all that scifi.
3,"syndrome - an ""ok"" medical thriller","Hoover does a good job with the complicated subject of stem cell research. He plots a good mystery involving ""miracle cures"" using stem cell procedures and pushes the ethical dilemmas to the limit. I thought the story dragged at first, and was about 1/2 way through before I reached the ""can't wait to see what happens next"" point in reading. Several typos but not too distracting. Doesn't have quite the depth of character, plot, and suspense development as a Robin Cook medical thriller, but I'm glad I persisted in reading to the end."
2,A frustrating read,"This is a poorly edited OCR scan of a boring and predictable story. I recmmend you spend 10 minutes on Wikipedia instead - it's more accurate, and the writing is better."
4,Syndrome,"I really enjoyed this book. The subject matter of stem cells and how they can be used to regenerate parts of the body or even stop the aging process, was very interesting."
3,Started good but.....,"I liked the start of the book, but it lingered on a bit and I had trouble wanting to finish it. It took too long to come to a conclusion."
4,Great first part of a possible trilogy,"Good story, seems ready for a sequel as in the exciting parts were held back for the end, look forward to a possible next part"
5,A superb spin on the age old question of what if,A telling tale of one example of good intentions gone awry. Who decides how far to proceed? What role does the establishment play in research and development of the heretofore unachievable? Is wealth the key differentiator or mental capacity to become how decisions are considered?
3,Predictable,"The subject matter of Hoover's books deal with stem cell regeneration and the Beta testing gone bad. It is very predictable. There are many words in the Kindle edition which are hypenated that really makes it difficult to listen to the audio. I got this as a freebie from Kindle. This proves the maxim ""you get what you pay for."""
4,Good read,"I like Hoover as a writer and this book was plenty good. A bit new age in its content, genetics in the probable future, but a good read anyway."
4,if you like medical thrllers,I like medical thrillers and this one has an interesting plot. It's not the best one I have ever read but it held my interest pretty much to the end.
4,decent read,"Well, I am a new Kindle owner, and this was my first book. I went browsing for free books, and this looked intersting enough. It started slow, but give it a chance. Really good ending which is something I can't say for even a lot of good books I have read. This is a free book, so definately worth it."
2,Missing words,"I thought this might be a decent book, but when I started to read it, I would turn the page and you could tell there were words missing. It was so bad I totally lost interest in it."
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"The premise of this book is intriguing. However, the extremely graphic foul language really detracted from the story. I really wanted to read this book to see how it all played out but the poor editing, foul language etc. just continued to get in the way. I ended up deleting it from my Kindle. Glad I didn't have to pay for it. What a disappointment."
1,Is this entered into a competition for how many hyphens can be used?,I managed to struggle to read 3% of this book and then gave up. I was genuinely interested in the subject and will give most books a good go. But I got so fed up with words being hyphenated mid-sentence (and mid-page) that I could not follow the story line.A little like this: I man-aged to stru-ggle to read 3% of this book and then gave up. I was gen-uinely interes-ted in the sub-ject and will give most books a good go. But I got so fed up with words being hyphen-ated mid-sen-tence that I could not foll-ow the story line.Would love to see this with some editing to sort out the gremlins.....
1,Typo's! Everywhere. And the editor needs to be fired.,This book has so many typo's I couldn't finish it. There are places where the author clearly meant to expand on an idea and placed etc or just left it hanging. It needs a new editor and another read through (or two) before I will give this book another chance.
2,Poorly crafted; puzzling medicine,"First, the bad hyphenation in the Kindle edition makes this book maddening to read. Lazy, lazy, lazy production -- he chose speed over getting it right.Second, Karen's aortic stenosis would have resulted in an aortic valve transplant years before the defect became life threatening. My husband has had two, so I know what I'm talking about. If Hoover got that wrong, why would I trust any of his medicine or science?But mainly I think the book crapped out on the ending. It wasn't good enough for me to even consider reading a sequel, so the teasers were just irritating."
1,"Free, but.........","Read the free Kindle version. I like free. However, my time is worth something. I felt the book was so bad I should be compensated for my time reading it. The story line was poor, the characters weak and the spelling, grammar and text formatting terrible. Was this created on a manual typewritter and scanned to digital?"
4,What a great Mystery!,This book kept me wanting ...more. I just love a good mystery book & Thomas Hoover delivered it. I'm looking forward to reading more of his books!
3,Good read,"Good read; however, there were numerous punctuation and grammatical errors. Of course, they do not detract from the storyline, but they were a bit annoying. Maybe better editing would help."
3,Good book,"Although the novel novel started started slowly, once the pace picked up the book got hard to put down. I found the subject very intriguing and would love to see some of the subject matter become fact from fiction."
5,One of the most intriging love stories of all time,"I first read this book when I was sixteen years old. I have read this book so many times I can not count. This by far is one of the best love stories I have ever read. Aislinn and Wolfgar are better than Romeo and Juliet. Their love inspires the heart and takes you away to another time and place. Bravo, Kathleen keep up the good work I love all your books you know how to touch peoples hearts and souls with your stories."
3,Not as good as other Woodiwiss novels,"Generally I love anything by Kathleen Woodiwiss. Shanna, Ashes in the Wind, and the Flame and the Flower are some of my favorite romances of all time, but this one didn't do it for me. It read like a soap opera: A bunch of people move from room to room (from the bedroom, to the hall, back upstairs to the bedroom), repeat the same things over and again, and generally do nothing until the big climax at the end. I did enjoy the last quarter of the book, but NOTHING happened otherwise."
3,i have all the paperbacks,"i ordered this book for my self. i have all the paperbacks and there falling apart. i wanted hardback copies. i know that i will not be ordeing from this company again. i know that i got a 1970's copy so given the book age i gave it a lot leeway. i ordered this book Nov 28th and got it late DEC. not fast shipping at all. the customer service was OK. he did email me once to tell me its on the way.. i emailed him back and asked when he mailed it out. he told me he mailed it should be there soon.if u want a great read in historical romance the u should read Woodwiss, just don't order from this company!"
4,My Favorite Romance So Far,"I read this book awhile ago and absolutely fell in love with it. True, I did get rather angry that the horrible things done to Aislinn and her family (most especially to her mother) and her people, were not revenged, I did fall in LOVE with the fact that even though this heroine gave her body because she had to, she never gave her soul which has always made me very angry with all of the romances that I have read. She never completely gave in and let him know it, which I admired greatly. I most definately recommend this romance for anyone who loves when the heroine is fiesty and has a will that is never broken"
4,"Extremely well-written, but somewhat predictable","From the first few lines, this novel had me hooked. The mystery surrounding the wolf was as thick as the fog circling it. I really liked the power struggles between The Wolf and the Dove. It was a nice difference from the meekness and timidity of Heather in the Flame and the Flower. I particularly enjoyed the uncertainty of the paternity of the child. That was a nice turnaround. I did think that the kidnapping and the culprit were slightly predictable. I understand one can only do so much with stock evil characters, but I was slightly disappointed in that aspect of the novel. This novel is one of my favorites. I still have my first bought copy."
3,Wolf and the Dove,"Somewhat historical and romantic story that is an easy ""beach"" read. Some parts are a little too personal for some taste, but I enjoyed the book."
1,This is a Romance novel??,"Okay so I purchased this book for my kindle because it had such a high rating on here. I made it halfway through the book and refused to continue reading it. I have never not finished reading a romance novel even if it was a poorly written one. But this was a book of CONSTANT rape. There is no way at all a woman could eventually fall in love with her rapist or ever enjoy it. What reader would enjoy reading a book about a young woman being raped every night?? Who would want her to fall for the guy? HORRIBLE ""romance"" novel!!!"
1,Horribly mislead,"How is this one of the best romances?I'm so disappointed by the positive reviews of this supposed romance classic. SPOILER ALERT. Ok, some books began with rape and murder, however when the hero shows up shouldn't that stop? Instead he all but promises to be the next man to have her with the knowledge that she's been raped the night before. I find it unbelievable and was completely disgusted by the heroine having stirrings of lust after her father's funeral, and let's not forget having been brutalized the night before. Generally these reviews have helped me pick out some really good books, but from now on I will be extremely careful."
3,WOLF & THE DOVE,IT WAS NOT STATED THAT THIS WAS A BOOK OF THE MONTH COPY. I FELT I PAID A PREMIUM PRICE AND THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STATED.
3,Pretty Good,This wasn't nearly as good as THE FLAME AND THE FLOWER and A ROSE IN THE WINTER but i liked it. The parts about the battles were really boring but the ending was really good. So if you start to read this book and start to find it getting kind of boring just keep reading because it gets better don't worry.
1,terrible,"i found it hard to get through this book.if you consider rape and repeated physical/psychological abuse to be romantic, then you'll love this book. also, you should seek counseling."
3,starts out OK,"then gets boring and leaves too many questions. Such as wasnt Aislinn a virgin with Wulfgar because it seems that the rape with ragnor never happened. If so why wasnt this straightened out when wulfgar first had her? WHy then the question about er childs paternity? And on and and on........This book in no way stands up to Woodisiss's best for me which is A Rose in WInter, now that is a good story with a wonderful hero!!"
3,"Ye Olde Romance, with one problem...","Past the now-stereotypical Alpha Male and fiesty female who nonetheless is too scared to speak up when it's actually important, allowing Big Misunderstandings to fester... there is a simply *ridiculous* 'plot twist' lurking ahead of you, that, for me, just blew suspension of disbelief out of the water.Avoiding spoilers, I can only assume that the point of it was some sort of idealisation of the heroine's purity, since it wasn't necessary to prove the other thing that it proved... there was other evidence for that. Still. Expect to crack up laughing near the end when this 'mystery' is revealed."
2,BUMMER,"This author's writing style is superb, too bad the first part of the book had rape in it. It ruined the book for me."
3,a little too long,"it was a little too long and i could not finish it but the characters are developed slowly and well. over all, it was ok,not as compelling as i had thought."
4,INTENSE,"Okay, it took me one week to think about the book before writing a review, and I did not start another book immediately (which is not normal) the book was just that intense. I starting reading the book and was unsure of how I would feel with the forcefulness nature of it. With that said, I did like the book. The scenes were very descriptive and I felt immersed in the story. I felt what she felt, the sorrow, the drive, the pain and then slowly the happiness and loyalty to Wulfgar. Many battle scenes, this one is not for the faint hearted.All in all, maybe a bit Scarlet O'Hara meets Stockholm Syndrome, but if you can look past that, a pretty good story."
3,"ok, but loses momentum","I am a romance novel addict and like to think I know a good book when I read one. This one goes on my ""ok"" list, and I'll never read it again. It was entertaining and the story itself was ok, but it seemed to drag on towards the end. The more I read the more I started taking notice of how many more pages I had left because the book started to really lose momentum and become boring. I felt the same way with ""Shanna"", another book by the same author. I love historical fiction, but I'll stick with Julie Garwood and won't read another by this author."
5,"The Wolf, the Dove and ME!!","Can I tell ya how much I loved this book? Well, to begin with, I named my dog Wulfgar, and I think I've read this book about six or seven times. I LOVE THIS BOOK. I have always enjoyed all of this authors books. She is one of my absolute favorite romance writers and always will be!"
3,The Long and Short of it,"The Good thing about a Kathleen Woodiwiss novel is that they are generally long. The down side of it is her plots get alittle bit mundane rather than keeping the reader in suspense. A bit like the difference between a sprinter and a cross country runner. One is short fast and gets right to the point the other is long, can drag on and lacks the excitement of shorter novels.Though that is not to say that a good author could not do something to combine the two.This novel as all the novels of Kathleen Woodiwiss's that I have read sometimes can get a bit mundane. I bought this because someone I knew highly recommended it."
3,Gift,I didn't read this. I bought it for my mother who loves this book. It is her favorite book ever
5,Beautiful love story,This novel will always stand out as the best medieval tale I have ever read. A beautiful love story that I must have read at least ten times.
1,Not as good as her others,"I've been re-reading some of this author's books after 20 or so years. Shanna and A Rose in Winter still stand up. The Wolf and the Dove does not. Keeping in mind things were violent in the time period this was set, I do not consider this romantic whatsoever.I agree with previous critics who state they couldn't believe how quickly Aislinn adjusted to the takeover of her home. On the one hand, it was refreshing to read a romance where the hero and heroine aren't always scratching their eyes out on the way to love, but this was awful. Wulfgar got his jollies spanking her? Yuck. I didn't care about these characters at all by the end.As far as the writing style, she is too long winded with detail. Even the books I love by her I have to do some skimming. She should shorten her books by 100 pages so the story itself really shines."
1,A waste of money,"I bought this book based on reviews, however I can't suuport the majority opinion. I found the story boring and at times bizarre. I sttruggled to finish the book and was sorry that I did, the reveals at the end were daft and did not fit at all with earlier parts of the story. If you like a good rommance, give this a miss."
3,lust and war,"*contains spoilers* this is a book about lust and war. not romance and courting. this book is different then any book i have ever read. i usually stray away from books involving war, torture, and rape. however, after reading shana i decided to give this book a try. i have read all of the negative reviews and was expecting something different. i expected to not like this book. however, i could not put it down. my only true dislike is the treatment of aislinn's mother. i do not understand why KW decided to write about the abuse of her mother. also, wulfar's sister is so annoying. why did they put up with her? the ending was not good and that is why i gave the book 3 stars. i recommend shana and the wolf and the dove however."
1,One word....YUCK!!!!!!!,"Let me just say right now that THIS REVIEW ONLY REFERS TO THE ""ROMANCE ALIVE"" AUDIO VERSION!!! In print, I loved it. It was this book that first attracted me to romance novels in general, and medievals in particular. I consider it one of my all-time favorites.Unfortunately, the good people at Romance Alive saw fit to destroy it. They took something beautiful and mutilated it, leaving out entire characters and scenes that I consider VERY important to the story...all in the name of squeezing it onto a single cassette tape.My advice to anyone even remotely interested in purchasing this version: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! You would be better off reading it aloud and recording it yourself."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","I read this book well over 30 years ago, I was in my late teens early twenties. I just read again this week even though I had just read it last year. Now I would like to point out to all the women that are into romance, think about it now back then there was no hallmark. What you might perceive romance to be now isn't real. Lol! No one was raped and if they were hearts can be mended with love. We take romance and replace it with love. No wonder the divorce rate is so high in the good ole romantic USA. It was a beautiful love story between two people who were enemies and they found a precious love that transcended all the hurt and pain either of them had suffered. This book is not for people looking for a Valentines Day romance."
4,Very informative to me.,I have been eating a raw vegan diet for the last 7 months and wanted to begin learning about growing my own sprouts and this book has taught me so much more. I am currently looking to purchase my next Sproutman book.
4,"Sprouts good, but grains not necessarily the way to go","Sprouts are great, but I don't think grains are necessarily healthy, even if sprouted. Sprout those seeds and greens, but leave the hard core grains like wheat alone."
1,Projector Bulb,"Discription of bulb, and the competitors bulbs on the same page, led me to believe it was a 500W bulb since all the others were clearly marked as 500W. This bulb was not marked, but I erroneously ""assumed"" that it was in fact a 500W especially since it cost more than the competitor's bulbs on the same page. Only when I received the bulb did I find out that it was only a 400W thus giving inferior projection quality. I am not satisfied with the supplier, but sending it back costs more than the competitor's 500W bulb, which I will order soon."
2,Projection lamp bulb,"A slide projector is almost a thing of the past, as hardy anyone takes pictures with ""slide film"".(Not sure its even being made any longer). But when you have 4500 slides to convert to didgital and the bulb burns out, leave it to Amazon to find one and quick.They did a super job of getting me a bulb in record time as I lost little time getting slides converted to didgitalThanks Amazon."
1,Bad Old Stock!,I orderd this bulb back on 10/03/2011. The bulb was gassy which means there was air in the bulb and when a gassy bulb is powered up it will frost over and then blow out. So it was already defective when it arrived. I asked for a return in hopes of a exchange or a refund. I got no responce at all. So $30.00 gone

4,Nice... when it's working,"Bought it, and I used it to polish my wife's car for about an hour the first night. When I got home the next night I went out to the garage to finish the parts of her car I hadn't done the night before, and nothing. Took it to the warranty repair shop and they had to replace the switch, which meant I had to drive around to get it repaired and was without it for almost two weeks. Not a great start for a tool with only an hour of use on it. Once I got it back, I've been very happy with it. I use it to polish and to sand. The ergonomics work well for me and it seams to have enough power for it's intended use."
2,sub-titled,"Malatya tells an important tale in the ongoing ""war"" against Christianity, this taking place in Turkey, but it was mostly sub-titled and not easy to watch. I would not recommend it."
4,"Good Quality, Bad Fabric","The only issue I have with this Shirt is that it's Polyester, which makes it not breathable during those hot summer baseball games, otherwise its good!"
5,good game that set me thinking for hours,"These days, video games involve violence, blood, and shooting. Though ""Trace Memory"" is rated T for teens, it contains puzzles and messages for gamers to decode. I reccomend this game to anyone who likes puzzles and brain teasers. Sadly, games like ""Trace Memory"" are not made as often as they used to be.I would give ""Trace Memory"" an A."
3,Good if you have attention span,"I bought this product back in 2007 as a 17th birthday gift to myself. I thought it was really fun for a while but somewhere along the way I got stuck at one of the puzzles. It's not that the game is particularly difficult, I could have easily found my way if I used GameFAQs but to be honest I never bothered to. Keep in mind that in a gamer's world, there's always another form of entertainment and on top of that I was a busy student. One day I might pick it up again because I did like what I did play. Obviously this is an incomplete review but overall I think this game is interesting but does not exactly have the wow factor to keep someone my age hooked. Young gamers might be more intrigued."
3,Not worth the money,"This game had an interesting plot but I found it to be way too easy and it took me less than a day to beat. I'm hoping I'll be able to trade it in because there is little to no replay value.Some of the puzzles were difficult, but mostly the game just involves walking around and searching different areas to figure out what to do next. Beware: There is a LOT of talking. This is a hugely text-based game. If you don't like that, don't get this game.I wish that it would have lasted longer than it did, but because it took me less than a day to beat, I just don't think it was worth it.Also, I wanted to note that the graphics on this game are pretty nice. Some of the best I've seen on the DS."
2,Over too fast,"I saw this in the store and was really excited to finally see a RPG that made use of the touch screen system (most the others that are now out were not available yet). Bought it, took it home, and popped it in.Things started out ok, but I had a dreaded feeling in the pit of my stomach. This game had SOO much potential. It rarely uses the camera, all the puzzles are easy to figure out and I finished the game in a couple of hours.Not worth the time. If you want to try it, see if you can find someone who was unfortunate enough to buy it and just try that out. Don't waste your money on something that won't entertain you for more than a few hours."
4,It's great but too short.,"I overally liked this game, although it is too short.The storyline and the game play is pretty good.You gotta be thinking every time to solve various puzzles.If you hate those text-based puzzle games and want some instant actions, do not buy this game.It's gonna be totally waste of money for you.and there is no re-play value, but you still pay as much as what you pay for other long games, which kinda sux.In conclusion, this game is recommended for most people, but this game should have been longer.Don't buy this game, if you hate text-based puzzles games."
2,Not worth it.,I really wanted to like this game. It looks gorgeous and the plotline intrigued me right from the start. Where did it go wrong? Was it the fact that the puzzles were so obvious that they functioned as merely timekillers? Was it the fact that most of the touchpad interaction seemed tagged-on and ultimately useless? Was it that the plot turned out to be predictable and cliched? Was it that the game was so linear that I couldn't have gotten lost if i tried?Maybe it was all of the above.
5,Trace of Greatness,"All I can say about this game is wow! The first good thing about this game I noticed was the sound, which by any game players standard was excellent. From the opening sequence to the closing credits the music, sound effects, etc. were nothing short of top notch. Next thing to comment on is the graphics. They were great. The setup having prerendered scenes on the top screen and all the touchscreen controls on the bottom, combined with the excellent puzzles which required the use of both screen, was nothing short of spectacular. Next is the story, which was very creative and well excecuted. If you own a DS you should own this game. This game is akin to the GBA game Pokemon, basically a system seller. Some of the puzzles in the game are very challenging, requiring the use of both screens simultaneously, which is something no other game system can offer. I hope to see and own more of these quirky and refreshing games."
3,A step in the right adventure direction,"I am a big fan of adventure games, specifically point-and-click ones. I decided to try this game and it had all of the elements of a good adventure game but no cohesiveness. Figuring out puzzles weren't logical and running to pick up an item to stick it in another room seemed ridiculous. It was hard at some points to understand what to do. I liked the ingenuity of using the DS's dual screen though for some of the puzzles. Overall, I am looking forward to seeing if Hotel Dusk is more of a refinement on what Trace Memory has done."
4,Good pick - for a short game,I truly enjoyed this game. Working a full time job and taking care of the house I don't have much time to devote to a game so I hate that I tend to never finish them. This game was short but not to easy so I was actually able to finish in a short enough time that I could still remember what I was playing. It also makes very good use of the DS features which were a lot of fun to figure out. My husband enjoyed listening to me giggle as I figured out some of the trickier pieces.
3,Pretty quick,"I beat the game in 2 days. It would have been one but it was Christmas.The puzzles aren't that challenging. I did however have to play the game 3x in order to get the good ending. if you don't trigger all of D's memories he just stays on the island. Grrr. If when you find the first shoe, he doesn't have a memory, you already missed something and will be able to still finish the game, but he will remain on the island unhelped.Annoying but since you can't leave the mansion once you're in it, make sure you touch EVERYTHING the first time around."
4,Finally a game that actually uses the DS.,"I got this game for only ten bucks and was not disappointed. It uses all the abilities of the DS and has a fairly decent storyline, good visuals, and overall is an addicting game. At least for me.Definately pick it up if you find it, and are into mystery/rpg/puzzle games."
4,Very fun!,"I recently got a Nintendo DS Lite for my birthday (even though I'm 22 lol) and wasn't sure what games I would be interested in.I bought Trace Memory on a whim after reading about it in a Nintendo Power my boyfriend had bought. (You're never too old for video games!)It was definitely better than I'd expected. The game play took a little getting used to, for me at least, probably because I'm still getting used to the DS itself. There is a lot of dialogue in the beginning to help set up the backstory, all of which is interesting by the way.The puzzles and clues were very impressive and it makes great use of the touchpad, which I liked.The story itself was well-written.The only downfall to the game is it is relatively short. I was used to Zelda and other such games that take a while to beat. I didn't like it being so short because I really got into it, so I hated to see it end. :(It will definitely be a game I will replay and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense/mystery games."
5,"Puzzle Fanatics, Rejoice!","I bought Trace Memory on a whim and it's one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. The talking of the characters tends to drag on a bit, but the game is filled with puzzled that require you to pay attention and be precise. Detail-oriented people will love this game; I know I did. I'm not sure about its replay value because I haven't gone back to play it again since I beat it initally, but it really hooks you in the first time through. There's no fighting or escaping from murderers or zombies or anything, it is purely a puzzle and logic game, and I give it two thumbs up. It's definitely worth its lower-than-average price."
3,Fantastic Storyline just WAY TOO SHORT!,"Trace Memory has a great storyline and in my opinion has better graphics than many for the DS. However, this game is SUPER short. I completed the entire game is less than 8 hours. I believe that they could have stretched out the game a little longer. I enjoyed this game because not only was I wraped up in the story, but this game really gave the DS the chance to do everything it was meant to do. You can use the stylus or you can use the buttons through the whole game. I prefer the stylus but again that's my opinion. - You can also use the microphone which I think is WAY cool! This game has many different puzzles too! I rated Trace Memory 3 stars overall because of the length of the game. If you are a relentless player like I am you might be VERY disappointed with the length of this game. But if you are player who plays a little every once in a while. You will most likely LOVE this game. I'm not saying I don't love it but it's too short for me!!!"
2,Can't wait to see what's next! Wait...It's over?,"The title of this review sums up my feelings on Trace Memory.It had a great, interesting, engaging story that didn't last.It's as if your favorite soap opera only has 3 episodes.The puzzles were interesting, but sometimes you've figured out the puzzle before the character in the game has and it makes you want to scream as your would at the television.I'd be surprised if you get stuck, but if you do, it won't be for long.The clock that keeps track of playing time in the game clocked me in at 3:29 (three hours and twenty-nine minutes) (yes, you read the parenthesis correctly).Thank God I paid 11 bucks for it. It's definitely not worth the full price."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"This FITS the Conair Opticlean electronic brush but the packaging states RBG3X & that's what it is compatible to! As I said, it fits product RTG3CSR (which i own) but the bristles DON'T move and it won't function when turned on so you'll have to send it back and lose $5-$6 on shipping fees. Make sure you read your product carefully!!!"
3,conair review,brushes are very hard compared to ones you get with the unit. Fit the unit so it was the correct part
3,Brushes good but deception on marketing by Amazon,"Found this product to be ok, somewhat overpriced and the item description indicated 2 packs of 2 - only received one pack of 2. Too bad the box stores quit selling these at $5 per pack."
1,Be Careful What You Order,I never even opened the package. I had the idea these were the replacement brushes for the power brush I bought since they were shown as an item I should consider. They were not for the brush I boubht so I returned them for a full refund which I received. Return policy is excellent. But I still can not find replacement brushes for my new DP16 Direct Plug-in Interplak Power Brush. If and when I can find replacement brushes I will write an updated review on the brush itself.
1,Dross,"I agree with the previous reviewer. The beginning generated enough interest for me to finish the book mainly by inertia. The author fumbles almost every opportunity at character development and fails to capitalize on the story's set up (cyborg/bionic man), hackneyed as it is. All of this might be bearable if the ending provided even the slightest shred of satisfaction. Instead, it's as if the author reached some magic word-count. The book just ends. It's an intensely dissatisfying close to a generally mediocre book."
2,Interesting Idea that never goes anywhere,"First few chapters seemed good, so i read to the end. But the author clearly had no idea where to go with the story. It ends SO abruptly, without resolving anything.There are some interesting ideas and some interesting scenes. In fact certain chapters would probably function better as stand alone short stories, than as part of a larger whole. I still remember his description of one chapter filled with shifting points of view, when the story is told from the perspective of various forest animals that are all killing each other that I found fascinating at the time. But scenes like that don't fit coherently together, they are just a bunch of random images jumbled together. As a novel, it just never comes together."
4,This book will be very helpful...,"If you are developer or tester who is doing the work related to I18N and L10N, this book will be very helpful for you."
2,Far too bland and easy-listening for my tastes,"I'm normally quite a fan of Front Line Assembly side projects. However, Conjure One, despite all the glowing recommendations, left me cold. I've given it several listens, and it never seems to catch my ear. To me, it is terribly bland, like watered-down Delerium. So, I guess I'd recommend this to people who feel that Delerium's a little too rough for them, and go back to listening to my old Will CDs (yes, another FLA side project)."
4,Beautiful vocals!,"Any fan of Delerium will appreciate the beautiful vocalists chosen for this album. I had not heard Poe before this and now I would like to hear more of her music. While the Sinead O'Conner track, Tears From the Moon, is not my favorite on this album, it's better than anything she has done on her own lately. My favorite has to be Sleep because I like the singers sweet and wonderful voice. There should be no hesitation to buy this album and no doubt that Rhys Fulber can make beautiful music just as well as Delerium along with Bill Leeb. I was amazed and really enjoyed the awesome remixes you get on the second bonus cd. A great album to relax with."
3,"It's a good release, but won't blow your mind.","I enjoyed this album, but found that only about half of the tracks really stood out. Some of the album just mumbles its way into new age background music with a somewhat overused middle-eastern vocal sample (which in itself is nice, but over and over and over...). So, I'd basically sum up my review by saying that this is an album with some great moments, and then some filler. The bonus disc was a nice addition with a couple of really nice trance-style remixes, like some of the more recent Delerium stuff."
4,"Looks like Delerium, sounds like Delerium...","For starters, I am an unabashed fan of Delerium from ""Karma"" onwards. As stated in the Amazon review, they've got a good thing going and seem to adhere to the ""it ain't broke, so don't fix it"" method of operation. ""Conjure One"" is no different. Same solid rhythm tracks, a slew of guest female vocalists, sometimes wailing, sometimes breathing ethereal. As with Delerium, colors and textures draw heavily on Middle Eastern influences. As with Delerium, it will be tough to classify this one; is it dance? Is it electronica? Is it World Beat? Is it New Age?Yes to all the above. Pretty easy recommendation here... if you like Delerium, grab this. It sounds just like them, and you should love it. My only question - if it LOOKS like Delerium and SOUNDS like Delerium, if the m.o. is the exact same as Delerium, and if it was done by the same personnel that drive Delerium... why isn't it a new Delerium album?"
2,Let down.,"I was very excited about all the hype I read on this CD, and very disappionted by the actual CD when I recieved it. I am a very big fan of Delerium and have all thier CD's (that is alot). This CD sounds like a bland imitation of Delerium, and is very boring all the way through."
1,Ersatz Indian electronica,"Right off the bat there are problems. The first track 'Demascus' sung by Chemda. Chemda is NOT from India. She's an Israeli. It's like listening to Sheryl Crow sing Chinese. She does her best but Indian music should be sung by Indians. All of the tracks are derivative; all have oddly familiar melodies. Like....he ripped them off! He adds middle eastern sounds to most of the tracks which I guess the Amazon.com reviewer feels are ""spooky"". There is far superior Indian electronica out there. Listen to 'Mondo India' if you want to listen to superior Indian/Pakistani electronica."
5,Simply breathtaking,"I own this CD since two or three years, but since I own more than 500CDs -plus 80GB of MP3- I don't always listen to all of them, all the time.Today I did a deep house cleaning and so, I decided to give it a try. OMG, now I recall why I bought this in the first place!It's one of the best albums I've listened so far. It's so powerful and quiet at the same time. It's like being in heaven everything I listen to it.All the tracks are great or, at least, I like all of them -something that didn't happened to me since Jam & Spoon'sTripomatic Fairytales 3003.You might like some of them more than others -Tears from the Moon and Sleep are amongst the best for me-, but all of them are GREAT.On the other hand I give a try toExtraordinary Ways-also by Conjure One- and it's good, but not as Conjure One.If you're going to buy just one CD from here to some time, make it be this one."
4,"interesting, not quite what I expected","From all the reveiws I read, I expected this to be a very close resemblance to delerium. It is very ethereal with female lead vocals on most of the songs and soft, electronic background music. However, it was a little too soft and poppie for what I expected. Not as dark and hard as (most of)delerium is. This is not to say it isn't good. There are many tracks I like on here, especially the instrumental ones. It just doesn't suit my usual tastes. If you like the new sound of delerium and are familiar with Rhys Fulber's work, then this is worth at least a listen. You will most likely enjoy and become entranced by it. It does come with a second CD with remixes that are pretty good."
1,UnSafe,"This worked good for a couple of weeks/months. After that, the electronic mechanism that is supposed to open it just makes a clicking noise but the safe does not open. Obviously I was lucky enough to find this out in a non emergent situation. Don't waste your money."
1,Embarrassed,"Locking was impossible, the combination lock wouldn't work time after time, the key lock was the same! Amazon shouldn't sell this on line after all the complaints."
2,"Decent, but not secure","Don't get this if you want security. The Tubular lock that came on mine is very insecure. I replaced it with a Abloy lock. The thing is constructed strongly and provides a way to anchor it, so that's good and the latch is protected decently. The battery dying thing is annoying, but it does warn you ahead of time."
3,Not Impressed but it does what it needs to do,I expected better quality and workmanship. Large gap where lid meets rest of case. Easily popped open when not mounted but for a bedside safe I guess it works. I would have liked better quality but it does its job.
1,Terrible Safe. DON'T BUY,I have this safe. It gets jammed all the time. Doesn't open up when you successfully enter in the code half the time. It's really no good for anything. Don't waste your money. Trust me.
3,You can do better,"This handy little pop open safe is a decent and has its place but I recommend to ask all your buddies and shop around.The good:Has a backup external 9 v battery contacts for emergency power to electric lockComes with a key to unlock without powerHas a LED light to indicate you are hitting the buttons and evens turn red with a rejected codeThe lid is spring loaded and creats easy accessThe bad:Has a piezo beep speaker to alert everyone within 30 feet that you are accessing the lock box- really you idiots!!!Without complete disassembly you cant disconnect the speakerAnyone who fiddles with the combination buttons for more than 6 button pushes will erase your access code!- really you idiots!,!!Add a pop up LED battery light to the underside of the lid is a must.That's all folks"
3,Good for the super cheap price.,You can't ask for too much when you're paying less than twenty-five cents for each car! I figured as long as they'd go and don't break right away it'd be alright. I gave it 3 stars because on a few of them the wheels would come loose but you could just pop them back in place and they'd go again and they didn't look bad either. I'd buy them again for $4 and free shipping.
4,"Unique Setting, Fun Gameplay","The History Channel's Civil War: A Nation Divided was absolutely a blast to play. It is in many respects a standard first-person shooter with a wonderful setting. Many weapons are one-shot and require reloading after firing (time to charge with bayonett). Missions tend to be shorter than average: clear out some enemies, blow up something, but really the mission perameters are similar to other FPS in the genre like Call of Duty.There are two career paths, one Union and one Confederate. Each battle is prefaced with a historical introduction, which to me is about a million times more interesting than the fictional stories that attempt to segue between missions in standard video games.Yes, there is room for improvement: no multiplayer, no cavalry, AI infantry sometimes get hung up. But is it a bad game? Not at all. It is a blast to play through on easy in an afternoon, and the challenge goes way up on harder levels."
2,Shoot Everything That Moves V40.11; Civil War Trimmings.,"If you are a fan of placing a cursor over a target by moving the thumbstick, and then pulling the R trigger, THOUSANDS of TIMES, in a hollywoodtastic setting of the American Civil War, then THIS is the game for you. You will be riveted in your chair as you single-handedly account for one-tenth of the casualties at Gettysburg, and 11 other venues. Why I expected anything more than what this game is, that being a civil war version of Medal of Honor, is beyond me. If you love Rambo, Medal of Honor, and urinating on the bloodiest American conflict in history, then this is the game for you. If you have any respect at all for the American Civil War, then this is not the game for you. Shame on you, History Channel. For shame."
3,Interesting perspective on history...not such a great game.,"Overall, the game is a little unrealistic, but it does give a lot of background information and history on the locations, events, and people of the Civil War. It is a good reminder of the battles that were fought to unite this country, but the actual battle simulations can be a bit unrealistic.It is still worth a play, but it is an easy beat for most any gamer."
2,SIMPLY A BAD SHOOTER,"This is one of the worst shooters I have played in a long time. It is not up to 360 graphics, more like PS2. I was looking foward to this game and it was a flop. Reload time is annoying. Lack of help from your AI team. Everyone in an enemy uniform is shooting at you and only you! Rent this one do not buy it."
3,No Cover,"What I found most frustrating about this game is that it seemed that enemy soldiers could hit you from any distance even if they could not see you. Trees and foilage don't serve for cover at all. You have to be completely out of someone's line of sight to avoid getting hit. You also cannot lay down, only crouch..."
3,Not what I expected,"First person shooter game with ""checkpoints"" that are not that interesting. Also, when you reach the checkpoint the scenario just quits. If I had known this was just a ""first person shooter"" I would have spent my money on another game. Somebody needs to make a STRATEGY based Civil War game!"
3,"Well, at least it's a game on the Civil War.","I got this game because I'm interested in the Civil War, and I was hoping that since it was ""The History Channel"" that it would provide some great education while having fun.Pros:-The Game looks ok, more like a regular Xbox game though.-It's a game on the Civil War, and there aren't that many out there, so it's good for a fan.-Fun to see and use the weapons of that era.-Some of the settings are pretty, and give you an idea of what it might have been like.Cons:-Not as much overall history as I wanted. Had some blurbs for each battle, but that's it.-The game isn't really that good. No huge bugs, but the AI isn't sophisticated and there aren't ever any 'huge' battles with many soldiers, that you associate with the Civil War.Overall it's mediocre at best, but it's cheap and if you like the Civil War and need an easy 1000 acheivment points, go for it."
2,A perfect example of a rushed job.,"This game simply was not finished. Oh everything needed to make it ""work"" is there, but none of it seems to have been tested and fine-tuned.All I'll say about the graphics is that they're fair but not up to par for a next-gen system.Your allies are dumber than dirt. It's not uncommon for them to be completely wiped out seconds after joining you. Fortunately your enemies aren't much smarter; but there are a lot more of them.The really glaring flaw that should have been caught and fixed in testing is the collision detection. What is the point of a first person shooter where you can fire your rifle point blank into an enemy's chest and MISS!?! When you're dealing with single shot weapons, you have to make your shots count.This game is a rental at best."
3,little fun game,this is a good fun game and I enjoyed playing it. reminds me of medal of honor the first one not that new ones.in how its a first person view when you play it.
2,Worse game i ever paid for.,This game is to short. I have only done both the North and South first two battles. I see no where how it progresses any further. I've ask about it and no one answers me. So as far as i know that's all the battles there are. Rent it first. Believe me i don't think you'll be buying it.
4,a Must-Have for GOS fans,"I would rate this a 5 for the arrangements and a 3 for the songs themselves. Perhaps the songs will 'grow on me' as I continue to listen to the CD, but there are several other GOS CDs which have far better compositions in my opinion. Nonetheless, I'm happy that it was available and that I now have it in my GOS collection."
4,Jabberwacky! Game,"I bought this product for a teacher at school who requested it as a gift. I have not used the product, but I have had feedback that this product has been fun and very educational for the kids. This is being used in a 2nd grade classroom at this time. The item worked great. It requires AA batteries that are not included (I think a total of 3 are needed)."
1,"Nice effort for a low budget film, but better luck next time","The story was weak, the acting was bad, the editing was the only funny part of the show, and that was because the cuts were done so poorly. I would save your money if I were you."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"One of the worst films I've ever seen. I don't understand how people even like this garbage, its just awful."
1,Awful,"This movie was a piece of crap, literally, I mean everything about this film is awful. ""Tortillas Again?"" is absolutely horrible as far as films go, whether you prefer Mexican-American indie films or otherwise. First of all, the cinematography is atrocious: it looks like a student film on a public access channel, if that's any indication. The acting is bad. Gosh, I think ""Carga de tunas"" its way better than this excuse for a film. I recommend ""Carga de tunas"" instead. Paul Ramirez should definitely change career. After seen this garbage, I'm sure that I would never buy ""Adventures of Paleta man"" (even the name sounds corny). In conclusion, this is the worst film I've ever seen."
2,written for professionals,"I feel that this book is written for professional psycologists. Somewhat interesting, but a bit over my head. I heard the author being interviewed on the radio and thought the book would be more interesting than I found it."
1,Title Deceptive,"I recommend you read a few pages of this book, before you purchase it. It was not at all what I expected."
3,not the most accurate handbook,"This handbook is good, but they are the older version of the prayers, it needs to be updated. This was published in 2004. The prayers have recently changed in 2011."
4,Adult Faith Information,We use this booklet in our Rite of Christian Initiation sessions. The RCIA is the way adults are initiated into the Catholic Faith. The booklet is given as a independant information resource for our initiation sessions.
1,Not a good deal,The Epson To34120 Inkjet Cartridges was for my Epson Printer Stylus 2200 and the price was great for the cartridges. The shipping costs were lousy and I will not order again. The shipping costs were twice the amount I paid for the cartridges. I bought three cartridges for under $5.00 ea. and the shipping costs were $24.00. Not a good deal.
2,Epson ink catridges,Ordered the wrong Epson ink cartridges for my printer. Adorama Camera refused to exchange these cartridges for the correct ones because the time limit to return items had expired. I'm out about $43.80 because I can't use these cartridges.
1,Looks great on the screen so different on my hand,"The watch is so very beautiful on the picture, but when I placed the order the seller (Nordstrom) send other watch, that look alike, but definitively different. I could not get an exchange due i live outside the US, so Thanks nordstrom an Amazon for the replica of what I saw in the picture."
3,How silly.,"I mean, they're kidding, right? Why not just sit down with Maltin's guide or an old copy of Movie Hound and come up with a list of the truly good films, instead of letting the studio dump a bunch of old rejects and loss leaders on your lap? I suppose if you've got money to burn and want to ""save time"" by not thinking (and shopping) for yourself, then this is a handy purchase... But then what about the time it will take to decide which of these movies are dogs and which are worth having? Seems pretty silly."
1,Warner Mega Classics A Joke LOL,"How can I say this and not sound mean I found the movies being offered to be ALOT for your average ""jo"" who makes it from check to check and even this offer is TOO expensive for the movies you get and they are NOT something I would pay for well maybe watch them on TV if nothing else was on sure there was some good ones being offered but nowhere WORTH the price Save your money for $4,000 I would goto DISNEY LOL!"
3,Some reviewers are being unduly harsh,"I wouldn't buy this set myself because I have most of the best ones already. A couple of sightings tells me that there is far more good stuff here than mediocre or bad. If a newish collector wanted to get a lot of good stuff in one fell swoop, this would be a pretty good opportunity. It all depends on the price, doesn't it? IF you don't have more than a few of the films, and IF you can get the set for a reasonable price, I believe there are some potential buyers. At the original price, no."
2,Waner JUNK STRAIGHT TO YOUR GARAGE,"2 STARS FOR THE FEW GOOD MOVIES, THE REST IS JUNK will end in your garage for months. come on, be smart for $500 us. you can buy hundreds of pre-view dvds in any music store , pick the best of the best the oscar nominateds movies are the best for your DVD collection not movies that the studio never get to sold in the shelds of walmart"" . the dvd never lost the digital quiality mostly of the people just buy them- watch and give away. Go with the best not with the amount. with that $4,000 i can go to europe have fun!"
3,"A great big ""Blob""","I looked at the films in this collection of ""classics."" Embrace of the Vampire, Poison Ivy, P.I. 2, P.I. 3 (P.U.), and others, are hardly classics. This appears to be a marketing plan to unload a bunch of mediocre DVDs that weren't selling, by hiding them in a list of better films, some great films, and many B-features."
3,The divine with the dross,"All that should be noted is that the the company now known as WB has elected to place Singin In The Rain in the same DVD collection with Tarzan the Ape Man (1981). Be wary, very very wary. The great and the garbage.No excuse for such an undiscriminating collection to be thrown together. What is the point? Surely they have bled us in numerous other ways, extra features that they have ""just discovered"". Endless packing must have its own end. Or not??"
2,Buyer Beware,"I can't imagine anyone buying a collection like this at a price such as this ... unless they are just out to get every movie WB released to DVD. The set defies logic. Some good movies, lots of okay ones, some are junk. The marketeers must believe that we buyers can't decide for ourselves what we like, hence they piled everything together and try to sell it as a package. If you are one of those considering this collection, I have some water front property in Florida to sell you too.I highly recommend that you pick and choose the movies you like (if unsure, rent it first) and buy them one by one. You'll save a bundle and be better off in the long run.Not recommended at all.~P~"
3,"Good Lord, Who Could Afford This?","I notice that Amazon has taken the price down considerably. It's obvious that hardly anyone can afford this! Classics, yes--Crappy films, yes.High unreasonable price? Hell, Yes!I guess if you're starting a video library, maybe?This has GOT to be the most expensive thing Amazon has ever sold. (at its' original 4,000 price, for sure!)"
2,At $20 per movie?,How many of you can't collect most of these for way under the $20 per movie price? There are great movies in this list and many I would like to have but probably would not buy except in a collection. Still the price is about $1000 too high for what you get.
3,Warner Mega Classics...,"I went through the list item-by-item. There are definitely a few movies that are classics. Then, there is the other 'stuff.' For that price, they should provide US with a list and allow us to choose. I've paid a lot of cash over the years for my DVD entertainment. I'm not about to sheel out $1100.00 more. For those of you with 'deep pockets,' dare you take the risk? Three stars..."
5,6 Ball 5 Star Review,"I thought the price for this was amazing ($10), and while it is JUST a bag, it was nice not to pay and arm an a leg for something that should cost minimally. It is functional as it is described, does hold 6 balls, and looks pretty nice."
1,Defective! And Tachikara Knows!,"Just bought this bag after using them many times in past. When I recieved the knew one it was way oversized. i was actually able to fit 6 volleyballs, 2 basketballs, and still had extra room. I then contacted Tachikara directly, and they told me that they knew that the bags were defective, and would not get the right size till they sold all the defective ones! They then told me that the bag was only oversized by about one inch on each side. Considering that a volleyball is only 8 inches in diameter, and the bag has four sides, that means that the bag is 1 1/2 times the size of a volleyball (explaining why I was able to fit so much inside of it). Even when I put 6 full size basket balls in it, it did not hold its tube form. Tachikara usually makes good products, but they droped the ball on this one!"
3,"I Don't Love It, But I Like A Lot Of It.","Based on the Editorial Reviews, it was clear this was bonafide Americana album. When I heard it though, I found much of it a little too country for my taste. There are some very enjoyable tracks here, with plenty of tasty guitar work, and real nice harmonies. There are also more than a couple really slow, boring songs that were almost unlistenable for me. It just wasn't very consistent. There are plenty of songs that deserve another listen, but not so much the album as a whole. It inspired me to put on some of my old Manassas CDs though, so it wasn't a total loss. If you're just curious about Electric Range, maybe you should put on a Manassas CD too, and save yourself a few bucks. And if you don't have any Manassas yet, well maybe you should start there. You won't regret that!"
4,Good Game at a Very Low Price,"A good game for any Caillou fan. From the opening theme music, the child is brought into a game with all of the favorite TV show characters. Very age appropriate for our 3 year old granddaughter."
3,Sleeping bag...,This is a great sleeping bag! It's comfortable warm and plenty of room. The only problem I have is that its very hard to pack away since its really big and puffy. Other than that I would definitely recommend it!
4,Nice sleeping bag - great value,"I purchased this sleeping bag for my pre-teen niece as a transition from the cutsey child sleeping bag to a more ""grown-up"" sleeping bag. It is nice and warm, soft, well constructed and very long. She is thrilled with it and I was thrilled with the price. It would be perfect for adults too in a mild to cool weather climate."
5,At last!,"Often in reading Holmes, Watson would allude to other cases that seemed so teasing to my mind. I would look over them and think, ""I wish Sir Conan Doyle was still alive, I would write to him just to hear from him what happened in the case of.."". Thankfully now a lot of the cases I had wondered about now have answers. I really enjoyed reading this book and will read it many times more over a lifetime."
2,Quite disappointing,"I found this volume in the library, and eagerly started reading. I'm a Holmes fan, and while nothing touches the originals, I have read some good Holmes stories by writers other than Arthur Conan Doyle. The fact that his son was writing or co-writing some of them made me think that these stories would capture much of the flavor and wit of the originals, but alas, this is not the case. First of all, the stories often feel like parodies of the originals, rather than trying to intertwine with them. Secondly, Arthur Conan Doyle always gave you all the information (as Holmes would say to Watson, we would see exactly what he saw, we just couldn't necessarily deduce anything) needed to solve the case. In these stories, I found that there were hidden bits of information that would just sort of pop out at you at times. If you're looking for good ""new"" Holmes stories, try reading Holmes for the Holidays."
5,If only there were more!,"I know that's a cheesy thing to say, but it's true. I may not be the most sensitive literaty critic alive, but this collection is very similar, in content and style, to the originals. It might as well be considered part of the cannon. Are there some contradictions with the elder Doyle's stories? I'm sure there are, but probably no more than the elder Doyle's contradictions of himself. If you've read the originals, you'll want to read these.This is also a very attractive publication. Nice type, nice packaging, illustrations at the beginning of each story, and quotes at the end--giving the supposed reference to the story you just read.Good stuff!"
4,The best after the real deal,"These are the best and more Sherlock-like stories since the ones written by ACD. Some of them are not as good, but in general it captures the essence of the characters and the environment. I read everything related to Sherlock, but this is so far, the most entertaining and interesting collection of cases post-ACD. The characters are very close to the original, and that is something to appreciate. None of the authors try to do anything to prove themselves better than the master. I agree with other reviewers. It is a very enjoyable book."
4,One of the Best Pastiche Holmes,"I truly enjoyed this book. As a fan of HOlmes, I wanted to read about his ""lost"" cases, or the ones that Watson mentions in passing but never puts down on paper. This is a delightful collection of stories, although I wished that ""The Giant Rat of Sumatra"" was included. ;-}"
4,Touching point of view.,"I don't normally read poems. But I read these and I must say that I did enjoy them. Made me wonder why I've never bothered before. My favorite is ""Give Me A Cat"". I'm a cat lover and those are exactly my sentiments. ""Laughter of the Soul"" was cute too. All the poems were good and easy to understand. Quite enjoyable."
2,Cute but not worth the money,"We bought this mobile as part of the entire Zanzibar set. Unfortunately, we had to replace the mobile after only three months. The wind-up action lasts for only a few minutes at a time, and the baby cries as soon as it stops. We were hoping for a mobile that would keep the baby entertained as long as he likes, or something that would help lull him to sleep. 2-3 stretches of music/spinning does neither."
3,"Kids love it, but it doesn't go nearly long enough","This is a great baby mobile, we got it with the whole set. Our twin boys just love it, and it plays a cute lullaby. But it is wind up and runs down WAAAAYYYYY too fast, we only get a couple minutes out of the one we have left (the other one is already stripped and doesn't work) We would love to keep the mobile part and just get a battery spinner."
2,cute -- but does not fit our crib at all....,"If you have the Zanzibar bedding, the mobile is a great match. It's pretty basic, no lights, just wind it up for music and the animals spin.I'm guessing that most cribs are designed in such a way that this will fit, however, our Munire crib (sold as Baby Cache by JCP) has wide moulding that makes it impossible to mount.We're now looking into buying a wall bracket to mount and use to hang the ""business end"" of the mobile from, but it was very disappointing that it did not have enough adustability as purchased to fit our crib. Also, the plastic parts seem pretty cheap, although overall the mobile is nice looking and a perfect match to the bedding."
3,Difficult to attach,"We love the whole line, bedding and all, but this mobile was difficult to attach to our crib. It actually ended up digging into you sons crib b/c it was not secure enough. We have since wrapped an old sock around it to prevent that from happening again. Our son loves it though, he smiles and giggles everytime we turn it on. He loves looking at the animals."
1,mine came broken,i never got to even try it out i ordered it in December but i didn't have my baby till march so when i went to wind it up for the first time for my baby it wouldn't wind the winder just freely turns but doesnt wind and since i didn't realize it was broken till march the seller wont do anything for me so i paid 40.00 for a useless mobile
1,waste of money,"Don't waste your time or money, this mobile is wind up, and only lasts a minute or so. Your baby will get mad, and you will get tired of standing there winding all of the time. My advice is a mobile that's battery operated, I had to find this out the hard way. Now I don't care if it matches or not, as long as my baby is happy, and he is!"
2,"Cute, but broke after six months","We purchased this for our now-seven month old daughter. She loves watching the animals and the music makes her happy too. However, even when it was working well, the giraffe kepts getting stuck on the mounting pole. We would use it for about 15 minutes a day, which I didn't think was excessive. About one month ago, the mobile stopped going around in a regular pattern. Now, the music will go, but the animals do not spin around all the time. Sometimes, the mobile will spin, other times it won't. I would suggest buying another mobile and don't waste $40 on this one."
3,iso grip vibration,"I am disapointed in vibration isolation with this grip.They are popular because they look good,but my hand held up better with my stock grips.I will likely switch to a foam grip for comfort."
5,Love them,"If you love your bike and love your hands, get them. They are worth every penny. Plus they look great! You will be happy."
5,Best purchase I've made yet!,"I purchase this for my 2005 Suzuki Boulevard C90. Installation took no more than 30 minutes and did not require any modifications to make it fit. I've field tested these a couple of times already. It could be me, but I have notice that my fingers don't get numb as they did when I was using the stock grips. These grips look great!"
3,Great once you get them on (M109R),"I installed these on a 2011 Suzuki M109R. On the throttle side, the grip would not seat far enough on the the bar and would not allow closure of the switch assembly. If I forced the grip on to the bar end more it would bind as there seemed to be some material, maybe glue at the end of the inside of the grip. I ended up having to use a flat file to taper the bar end to allow free movement of the throttle. The clutch side was easy. Maybe my difficulty was unique, but then again after checking a forum it seemed many others have the same issue. Some used a hack saw to take off a bit of the bar end, others had no problem. Could be a quality control issue with Kuryakyn."
2,perfect size for soup,"I have had a set of this cookware for two years. I missed having a 3 quart pot for soup. I bought this pot a few weeks ago and have already used it several times. Even heating,easy cleanup, sturdy but not too heavy."
4,Just a good book,"Character development was intriguing and the pace never flagged. Will look for more from this author. Read it, you won't be sorry!"
4,Great dvd on Alaska,"If you are planning a cruise to Alaska, this dvd helps you see what is there, and helps you plan excursions during your cruise. Alaska is a beautiful state, and that is an understatement."
4,Some good infromation here,"This is one of two DVDs on Alaska I purchased prior to our upcoming Alaska cruise. It has some interesting information and some decent photography. Production and content are OK, but not as nice as the other DVD I purchased at the same time. Is it worth buying? yes."
2,Stop trying to impress with your mystery knowledge,"If the author would stick to writing mysteries, her books could be among the best in the genre. However she spends way too much time describing people's actions and motives by comparing them to another author's characters. Noone thinks or does anything on Broward's Rock without Annie commenting to herself that the thought or action was just like this or that fictional mystery character. While I enjoy the bit with the contest that has the characters guessing their fictional origin, this constant ""showing off"" of the author's mystery fiction knowledge detracts from the story. Any true mystery buff probably knows as much but hopefully doesn't spend their time sizing up their friends and family by this criteria.Stick to the mystery writing and leave the mystery trivia to game players."
3,Murder among the nabobs,"...This addition to the Death on Demand Series is a bit more wordy than some of the others and Annie and Max seem to do a lot of investigating without making much progress. Also Max's mother seems to be a silly, unnecessary character who doesn't add much to the proceedings. Fans of Carolyn Hart will probably want to read this book, but it is not her best."
2,A disappointing entry into the Death on Demand series,"I always eagerly await the next DEATH ON DEMAND book. Annie's usually funny, Max adorable, and Laurel maddening. However in this entry, nothing much seems to happen and those beloved characters fail to come alive. Annie's best friend, Henny Brawley, has been injured, but it also the prime suspect in a murder. That alone should've made for a great book. But Ms. Hart couldn't put it together this time. I like the references to other mysteries -- I've found a lot of new favorite authors through the mentions in Ms. Hart's novels. Please make the next one better!"
5,Blackheart among white elephants,"Collecting secrets was Kathyrn Girard's livelihood. Her dingy antique store, with its small cashbox, would not support the glamorous double life she led, a hacienda in Mexico and a sleek black Porsche. When she is found murdered while collecting white elephants for a charity sale, the suspect list includes prominent island residents like the wife of the parish priest, the editor of the Island Gazette, and Annie's best customer, mystery buff Henny Brawley. Annie and friends must now dig into the secrets of their friends and other blackmail victims to ferret out the one desparate and bold enough to put an end to Kathryn's demands. Through dogged detective work, following every clue and thread, the murderer is not unveiled until the very end."
2,To many mystery allusions,"I usually enjoy Carolyn Hart's mysteries, but in this one there was not enough action and there were WAY too many allusions to other mystery writers and their books. A few here and there is fine, but it seemed that the references were sprinkled on every page. Please, Ms. Hart--give it a rest!"
5,Excellent vacuum cleaner bags,"These are excellent vacuum cleaner bags that work very well, even when vacuuming areas that have not been vacuumed in quite some time and have accumulated a lot of dust. In the many years we've had the Hoover vacuum, these are the bags we've used, and there has never been a problem with them. Dust stays contained in the bag, and they are easily changed with no muss, no fuss, even though I often wait until it is well past the ""full"" line. They hold a lot so one package lasts quite a long time. I was very happy to find these on Amazon rather than having to look all over the place for them."
4,Thinking person's beach book,"I found this book at a thrift shop and was surprised I hadn't heard of it before. It's a ""beach book,"" but a GOOD one. The premise isn't the same old thing -- it's told from the perspective of a policeman (Trip) in a beautiful area of California who grew up there knowing a rich family. The scion of the rich family, Rex, is a soap opera star who is a good guy but has hashed up his life in various ways. Trip gets further and further drawn in to Rex's life, having more common sense but not being immune from envy over Rex's good looks and the things that come to him easily. It made me think of my mother's cautions to me as a child -- don't envy other people whose lives look perfect, because you just don't know what's going on inside their lives. That's a worthy thing to remind ourselves of as adults, isn't it? And this is a crisply written, suspenseful reminder."
4,Men Can Change...,"...how they see and conduct themselves in society, how they treat women and other men and, this book can help. Thoroughly accessible, Katz simply asks us, and shows us how, to take responsibility for change. This book certainly has changed to way I look at things, the way I talk to men and other women and, most importanly, the way I listen. Highly recommended."
4,"Great throttle response, not better MPG","I have put a K&N; Fuel Injection Performance Kit Gen2 Air Intake Kit on my Chevy Tahoe and Honda Civic. One thing that is immediately noticable is the greatly improved throttle response. When you press on the pedal, it jumps off. We have not really enjoyed a significant improvement in MPG. It may help a tad, but driving style and tire pressure I think our bigger influences on the MPG you get.When excelerating heavy, you will have a significant increase in engine noise. We actually like it, but some may be annoyed. The best part is not having the guys who change your oil trying to sell you a $10 air filter for $30."
5,awsome,this product arrived fast and on time. mounted right up and makes a noticeable difference. def more power but i have not seen a mpg increase but its winter and i let my truck warm up for about ten mins every morning so im sure that makes a difference. i have k&n cold air intakes on all my vehicles including my Harley Davidson. i would def buy this
3,"Mediocre, could be better.","I bought this ball bag from Amazon in Nov'08 and I have been using it for a few months. I like to carry around a bunch of sports balls in the trunk of my car in case some impromptu sports time pops up in daily life and events (I've been the hero more than once for being at an event in the middle of nowhere and producing a football from my car trunk).Overall I would say its been mediocre for me, but not great for my needs.- My #1 con would be the white color... I would prefer a black bag color to hide the dirt better.- My #2 con would be the size, it is too big. I have at least 6 items in the bag and it is still seems empty. If I had the option I would want a bit of a smaller bag so there wasn't loose material lying everywhere.Overall I give it 3 out of 5 stars. The bag does seem to be decent quality but the two ""con"" items I have do bug me.I hope you found my review helpful."
5,More than 1 use!,"I actually cut the bag open & use it for the base of my rag rugs. It's easy to weave fabric in between, lightwieght & holds up in the wash."
4,Beautiful solo harp music for the Christmas season,"I had this cd on a lot over the holidays. It is soft and beautiful and very relaxing. The harp doesn't stand out in the mix as much as it does on Cynthia Douglas' cds, but Sunita's music is gorgeous and rewards close listening. The hymns wil put you in the holiday spirit.It is a good disc to have on in the background while you read or work on something in the office or around the house (In my case, around the office is more likely).I still prefer Cynthia Douglas for celtic music on the harp, but Sunita is considered one of the best young harpists in the world, and this cd is very good. Recommended."
1,Poorly designed,"KitchenAid mixers are great. I have other kitchen items with their brand name on it and they're good too. This is just poorly designed. If it were a $15 coffee pot from the big box store you probably wouldn't complain too much. With the KitchenAid label, and let's face it, the price, it's a travesty."
2,"Didn't even last a year, Piece of Junk","I bought this Kitchen Aid model off the net less than 1 year ago as a house warming gift to myself. I've been in the house 10 months and already on my second coffee maker. This coffee maker last the first 8 months. I've been a big believer in Kitchen Aid products for many years, but now I second guess and research more prior to making purchases. Very disappointed in the performance. My old Hamilton Beach maker that I bought back in 1994 is back on the counter and brew coffee every morning for since. Kitchen Aid just doesn't make products like they used to."
2,Not up to KitchenAid Expectations,"I have had nothing but trouble with this coffeemaker. If you don't hold your mouth right when you put the carafe in it will fill up with grounds. This is by far the worst coffee maker I have ever owned. I called kitchenAid to complain and they just keep insinuating that I am doing something wrong like not putting the filter in right or not making sure the filter basker was in right. The design of the water filter is terrible also, it doesn't lock into place properly and will float to the top when filling with water.. I have always been please with KitchenAid products, but after dealing with them on this coffeemaker I am done with them."
1,Please think twice!!!,I ignored the reviews and bought this for my in laws as a gift. What a mistake. If you put 10 cups of water in the pot you get anywhere from 4 to 7 cups of coffee after brewing. I don't know where the water goes but it doesn't end up in the pot. This is a nice looking machine but Kitchen Aid has ignored quality control. Thank god Loews took it back.
2,Coffee on the counter,"I did not choose this coffeemaker, it was given to us as a gift. I have no problem with the coffee itself, but the overflow issue is ridiculous. It happens whether I'm making a full 10-cup pot, or a 4-cup pot, or anywhere in between. It happens about 50% of the time. No rhyme or reason to it. The first one we had eventually stopped working (some error code)...the KitchenAid people nicely sent me a replacement (very nice customer service, especially since we received it as a gift, without any kind of receipt.) The second pot overflows just as badly as the first. A second, smaller issue is the darn beeps--when the coffee is done brewing, and again when the unit turns itself off (those I can usually avoid)...I have two small kids, and those darn beeps are LOUD!"
1,KitchenAid let-down,"We have just updated our kitchen with all KitchenAid appliances. I was thrilled to find a K.A. coffee maker at such a reasonable price, with a stainless steel carafe & front. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED.There is no water gauge on the front to let you know how many cups of water you've poured in, the water was hard to pour into the resevoire without most of it splashing out, the coffee wasn't hot right after brewing OR after sitting in the sealed carafe for over 20 minutes!! The buttons seemed weird to use....overall, it is worthless to us!!!!Boxing this puppy right back up, and returning it.The search for a coffee maker that actually makes HOT COFFEE continues, but DO NOT buy this one!"
1,Poorly engineered Carafe,"The lid on the Carafe is so poorly designed, that in just a few short months, the flanges on the cafafe broke off, rendering the lid practically useless. The company would replace the lid, but not the carafe which was the problem. I'll not buy another KitchenAid coffee maker."
1,Get Flood Insurance,"I bought this coffee maker approximately 5-6 months ago and had used it almost everyday. After 4-5 times walking into my kitchen first thing in the morning and seeing how most of the coffee was on my counter top staining my grout, instead of the glass carafe, I returned it and gave it a funeral. I gave it a few chances thinking it was user error (not putting carafe in properly), but after so many chances and floods, I gave up. This is a serious design flaw and if it hasn't happened yet, it will soon."
4,kitchenaid 10 cup coffee maker,"this coffee pot works well. i was a little hesitant about purchasing it because of the overflow rating from previous reviews, but haven't had a problem out of it. it comes with a pack of paper filters and also a permanent filter. i recommend the permanent one, the paper ones do cause grounds to spill into pot. it looks great and the timer beeps when its ready and when it cuts off."
2,Mold in the reservoir!!!!!!,"I have had this coffeemaker for a little over a year now and just yesterday I happened to notice the whole reservoir was growing a nice layer of MOLD all over everything!!!!!! I yanked out that filter thingy, which is covered with brown slime, and turned the whole coffeemaker upside down. I hesitate to use a bleach/water mixture to clean it for fear my coffee will taste like bleach! I'm considering throwing this coffeemaker away and buying a whole new one. I wish there was a way to remove the reservoir in order to clean it thoroughly. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE BEEN DRINKING MOLDY COFFEE ALL THIS TIME!!! WHO KNOWS HOW LONG THAT MOLD HAS BEEN IN THERE!!!! YUCK!"
2,pain and pleasure,"First one went kaput after a very short time. The second lasted a little longer. After a very drawn out conversation, received the third one.....very sensitive to cleaning needs....filter in water reservoir floats out of place very easily...it should be designed to lock in place....Good points...time since brewing displayed...can interupt brew to pour a cup...Be Sure To Clean basket daily or else you will have a mess...electronics are sensitive and easy to go to error meesages"
3,Not Pleased,"My wife despizes this coffee maker and wants to send it back. When we make coffee we need to heat the water with the microwave before the water is added to the machine. If we don't the machine will flash err 1 and will not make the coffee. We could use warm tap water (advice from the help center) but that would bypass our filter system, also the water cools off over night so timer will not start making coffee in the morning.Otherwise, ... I am happy with the unit. We haven't experienced other problems with kitchen aid appliances and hope this problem is unique to unit that we have."
3,kitchenAid coffee maker,"The problems I have had wiht this coffee maker is that the lid does not close completely when you flip it down. You have to remember to give it an extra pustdown. If you don't you will wind up with coffee all over the counter, Also the stick with the filler levels on it is difficult to see. You also have to be right handed if you want to fill it directly into the coffee maker. There is a back flap you can fill directly into the coffee maker but then you can't see the fill lines at all. So as long as you remember to close the lid completely and fill it with water from the coffee pot you're ok."
1,I want my old pot back!!!,"Hmmmmm. Seems like everyone here received this model in exchange for a recalled model, including me. Kitchenaid...please re-attach the cord and send me the fire hazard back!! This coffeemaker is attractive, but looks aren't everything. Each time we have made a full pot, the coffee grinds have overflowed into the carafe, even though we use Bunn oversize filters. We have had to resort to brewing less than the maximum amount. Sigh. The water does not reach proper brewing temperature and the coffee is weak. I guess in this case, I got what I paid for. Nothing."
2,"Aesthetically pleasing, but has a major flaw","This coffee maker looks nice on a countertop, and makes great coffee. However, a there is a significant flaw in the design of this machine. If the coffee pot is not precisely positioned during brewing, the basket doesn't drain into the pot, but rather overflows into the area behind and under the pot, and finally onto the counter. I've learned to compensate for this, but a person shouldn't have to make such an effort with an $80 coffee maker."
1,Overflows Consistently,"I bought this coffee maker to match my KitchenAid blender and coffee gridner. The coffee maker is attractive but works terribly. If you make more than 1 or 2 cups it overflows hot coffee onto the counter top. There is almost always grounds in the coffee too. When I called KitchenAid customer service they said they made a revision to fix the problems and sent me another one. It has the same problems. This is NOT user error I have tried different coffees, grinds, and positioning the carafe differently. This coffee maker is just a distrastrous design mistake. Finally I got KitchenAid to buy the coffee maker back and got a Cuisinart one. It works perfectly, costs less, and has more features. I would recommend Cuisinart and highly recommend that you do not buy this shoddy coffee maker - you will regret it."
1,Constant Error Message Right Out Of The Box,Received error message the first time it was pluged in. I guess I'll go back to buying $20 throw away coffee pots that work for 20 years. I've always been happy with Kitchenaid products until now.
2,KitchenAid Coffemaker review,"You'd think that there's not much room for error in designing a coffee make but this product has a major glitch. If you don't rest the coffee maker on the burner just right, the coffee that drips during the brewing dprocess does not all land in the carafe! I've had several messes to clean up. Also, the coffee occassionally has plastic taste that is being picked up somewhere during the brweing process.(...)I'd find that these glitches are not compenstated for by the numerous user-friendly features and great styling."
3,Headers,"Took a little tweeking to get to work correctly. Paint peeled almost immediately when they got hot. Repainted with extreme heat paint and now ok. For the price, would say try them. Gary"
2,Nothing new here,"This book missed it release date many times. I had hoped it would be up to the standards of the authors previous book Weapons of the Navy Seals Volume 1 from a few years ago (there never was the promissed V2). However this book falls short of the mark. The information is dated and there are very few illustrations. The information presented on pre 1990 is pretty good, however the lack of photos and supporting data is a great detraction. I really hope the author does follow up with better supported title. Until then I reccomend Pushies book on Weapons of the Navy Seals."
4,A Treasury of Princesses: Princess Tales from Around the World,This is a wonderful book that people of all ages should love. I read it while teaching my students about fairy tales. We also use a world map to locate the countries from which each tale originated. My students love it!
2,disappointing,"This is the sort of regional gardening book that might have been marketed in 1965. The information is very basic, poorly explained, poorly illustrated, and dated. I doubt if the book was good for much when it was first published in the late 80's, but now with the revolution in Southern gardening carried on by the likes of J. C. Raulston, Tony Avent, William Welch and a host of others, the book seems stale and joyless."
2,"Gardening in the South With Don Hastings : Trees, Shrubs and","I was very disappointed with this book. It carries almost no usable data, just vague language. It seems that Mr. Hastings used this book as a tax right off to travel to England and other countries for research. I do not care of the lush lawn of England, nor do I care of the beauty of an oasis in the Middle East. I especially do care to read phrases, as ""there is no perfect grass for the South, just make do with what you have"". I rated this book 2 stars due solely to the pictures. If you were looking for a book that offers real usable data, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book is a real disappointment. Basically it mimicks public information that is readily available on-line and the restaurant recommendations are really suspect since I know of one that no longer exists and another that is dirty at best. I was expecting some seasoned ""insider"" info on things to do and see and eat. I wish I had my $$$ back to pay for the gas for my next day trip!!"
4,Good guide,"If you've got little time to explore, this guide will get you to know the Houston vicinity covering the main attractions. It is more text than pictures and it is a good book and has outing options for every taste, including places to eat, visit, etc. I have found it somewhat more practical (or at least cheaper) to reasearch on internet and google maps, but this is alltogether a good guide, and is ordered in a firendly way separating each trip by cardinal points (i.e.: trips to the Southeast, Northeast, etc). I have used it quite a bit and found it useful. I also haven't found many others alike so I guess if you got to it, it's down the line of what you're looking for. To me it's a 4 -star."
3,Nice,"I was looking for the latest version of the day trips. I am unsure if the 12 edition is the mst recent, but it did ship quickly and book was in great condition! Thanks!"
4,A Review,"A somewhat initially straightforward plot about murder in a rundown clinic,which then leads to something more sinister.This is how best to describe The Zero Imperative,the first in the PROBE series of Doctor Who spin-offs,featuring Caroline John,Linda Lusardi,Colin Baker,Sylvester McCoy,Jon Pertwee and Louise Jameson.The confused ending may be a little hard to follow,but the acting is of a high standard and as such it withstands repeated viewings."
2,Dont Buy This One,"I made a mistake ... i didnt read the reviews so i will chalk this up as a lost but i so didnt want to send it back but i was very un happy with the band it was hallow and cheap it made the watch feel like a cheap watch , which it is not but i paid the 10 bucks and sent it back ... but thanks amazon for the refund it came right on time .."
3,Nice but not my favorite...,"I was attracted to the classic look of this watch and the oyster s/s bracelet. The case itself is nice, and it looks nice overall, but the band is made of hollow links, and feels weak to me for this kind of watch. I imagine a rubber strap would hold up better.Seiko automatics are supposed to be pretty good movements, but in this price range I don't think they are known for their power reserve (the amount of time the watch continues to run after you take it off the wrist).In the end I decided to return this one so I can't speak to long term reliability, but other Seikos I have known are great watches."
4,"""Quoth The Raven""","This Book is an adaptation of Lou's Album of the same name(which is an adaptation of Lou's play POEtry). Overall it is a good read for the Reed fan or the Poe fan. In the book, Reed slightly adapts some of Poe's most memorable poems to reflect his feelings/experiances. Interesting stuff."
1,Buyer Beware,"While the research may indeed be good and the content is, as far as I know, accurate, that's where the good news ends. The JH White Papers is a marketing scam run by a company called Remedy. When you order one, thinking you have paid for and purchased that single product, you are automatically enrolled in a subscription. You will start getting bills for things you didn't order. You will be spammed by endless offers almost daily. There will be no phone number on the bills to even contact customer service. They don't want any contact with you.I found the site below by accident, trying to find out how to shut off this flood of bills and unwanted papers. DO NOT, do not, do not get into this loop - you'll be sorry you did. I can't believe an institution like Johns Hopkins would be associated with such a sleazy marketing effort.Read the full details here: [...]"
5,this CD is super DOPE!,"Eddie Kim has no clue about whats fresh and whats not! Graffiti kings is one of the best albums i bought all year. Come on, Pete Rock, Swollen Members, Aceyalone, Phoenix Orion, Darkleaf, this line-up is off the hook...plus it includes a Graffiti booklet. Underground Hip Hop at it finest. Eddie Kim needs to review some Christina Aguilera or something. Graff kings..pick it up you won't be diapointed."
1,Not what you'd expect,"I was at a record store and I was debating over this album and High & Mighty's Home Field Advantage. I bought Grafitti Kings and ripped open the CD expecting it to be dope. After all, the line up has some dope cats. Anywayz, seriously, this album is weak. I dunno what Aceyalone is spittin on hea but dont waste your money. Whoever says this album is tight repy statin your reason. Other than that, go cop Deltron 3030, Reflection Eternal, Blackstar, or The Roots, to name a few. Peace"
5,"Well, it works.","There isn't much to say about a product like this. I bought it, it came, I plugged my Mac's power cord into it, I put it into the German socket, and I haven't had a problem with it in the three months I've been using it.I do prefer it aesthetically and functionally to the more complex adapters with all the different options and locking mechanisms. This one is very simple and straightforward. I've only been using it with my laptop, and I haven't been plugging and unplugging it a lot. It just... works. It's fine."
4,"product not as pictured, but works well","The product name is a little off. It should be USA to some parts of Europe. The product description lists the countries in which the adapter works. I've ordered quite a few of these in the past year. They're pretty good in terms of quality. I've used these in Austria, Germany, Hungary, and France. If you plan on traveling to other countries in Europe such as the UK or Italy, you'll need additional different adapters. I've ordered the Grounded Adapter for Italy from this same company. It is equally good in terms of quality."
3,EU standard only,"I purchased this adapter for a recent business trip to the U.K. Once I arrived at the first hotel in England I realized that the adapter was not going to work. I believe that it is configured to simply adapt the U.S. plug to a European Union standard (which I didn't find in England and may not be everywhere in the rest of Europe.)Instead of this, I suggest purchasing the Sharper Image Worldwide Adapter with USB Charger. It has plug adapters for many countries including the EU prongs of this product. It is also capable of charging your USB devices such as cell phones."
1,Not the correct adapter for Ireland,I purchased this item for my wife who is traveling to Ireland and Sweden based on their claim that this plug works in Europe. Evidently they don't consider Ireland as a part of Europe because this plug doesn't work there. I rated this item 1-star because the item doesn't do what this company claims.
5,Great adapter,I bought this in preparation for a year in South Korea. I use it every day and it works perfectly
3,"Great Buy For The Price, But Check Before You Travel","I couldn't beat the price for these adapters. I ordered 2. Once they arrived, the quality of the construction seemed to be pretty decent. I left the next day on a business trip to Spain. Unfortunately when I went to use them, one didn't work, there was no through power on the defective one. Once I posted my initial seller feedback, the company contacted me immediately offering to replace the adapter at no charge. I certainly appreciated the offer, but it wasn't going to do me much good now...maybe for the next trip. These are a great buy at this price, but just be careful to test them with a continuity meter or something before you travel with them just in case you have an experience like mine."
4,Grounded Europe Adapter,Product was purchased for my daughter who took her laptop to Denmark. The adapter was received in record time and it works!!
4,Grounded Europe Adapter - CE Certified - USA to Europe - Heavy Duty Adapter,"Nice adapter to have, but it was a little difficult when trying to push the adapter into certain socket's in my hotel room. I would recommend having one or two of these along with some other smaller adapter's or a power converter."
5,Almost a masterpiece,"and a great read, especially if you are inhterested in the art scene in New York during the 60's."
4,There is a design flaw that can be overcome,"The issues about dripping, leaking, running, making a puddle seem to be hotly contested. Those who experience it say this thing is not good and those who have not say that the former group can't follow directions.Having returned a first unit due to blemishes (but no dripping) and a second because of dripping (but no blemishes), I can tell you what the problem is. The removable plastic coffee filter holder has a spring-loaded stopper. This spring is about as strong as one on a ball point pen -- certainly it will not hold several ounces or cups of coffee from dribbling through. It seems that the variability in spring tension probably accounts for the radically different comparisons. If you have a unit that dribbles, then I suggest going to a hobby store or hardware store and buying a stronger, thicker, more resistant spring to keep the valve tightly shut unless opened by inserting the carafe below it."
1,"Cool design, poor function, makes you go OOOO","It looked cool; that's why I bought it. I should have known, since some great Amazon writer/reviewers said the thing was problematic.The design is about 40% wider than it needs to be, first off. But the biggest flaw is trying to seat the coffee pot into the lip to catch the drip. It wasn't uncommon for the pot to unseat itself, 1/2 cup into brewing, and just stop. The brewing is really slow, which makes for rich coffee, but the pot also fills full of grounds. I've tried both the gold filter and paper ones, same problem.After using this for 2 weeks, I am packing it up and sending it back."
4,Capresso makes another good machine,"This has been in my kitchen only a few weeks but I think this is a winner.This machine is very simple to operate and does everything i want it to do. I have not had the problems noted in some other reviews, everything works well. It is larger than really necessary but the dimensions are in the ad and looks are subjective. I like it."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"After researching coffee makers my wife and I decided to go with the Capresso ST600. We purchased it from WholeLatteLove for $170.00. It worked great for six months. It has recently started leaking water out of the base. At the start it was just a small amount, but over the last week it has become a flood. A complete waste of money. Now everywhere you look the ST600s are on sale, another bad sign."
4,Keeps it Hot,"We received the coffeemaker quickly, and started using it right away. Took a little bit to set it up - but it works great! Keeps the coffee hot for quite a while - at least now we don't have to microwave the last couple of cups. The pre set works great coffee is ready as soon as we get up, and goodness knows we need that first cup to get moving in the morning! Only downfall is I wish it made 12 cups instead of 10. Looks great, easy to clean."
4,Makes a delicious cup of coffee,"Once you learn to setup the carafe properly so that it stays in place while brewing, this is a gem of a coffee maker!"
2,Horribly disappointed,"This is the most I've spent on a coffee maker. It was delivered right before Christmas of '06 and broke 3 months later. What a waste of money.It made very good coffee while it worked. The last time I expected it to function, I was greeted with a flood on my counter and floor. All 6 cups of water had leaked out. The 'ON' button stopped working. No doubt it somehow shorted itself out from the water.I will NEVER buy this brand again."
1,Leaks,Pot leaked all over the counter because the top which had to be loose to let the coffee in kept sealing. Defect in the product so I returned it and Amazon gave me a refund.
1,BEWARE,I checked one star because there was no option for zero stars. We bought this machine for its looks. Capresso makes wonderful machines. We had ours replaced three times. It makes a mess. Thats it. If you enjoy wiping the counter after every pot is brewed this machine is for you. I seriously would not put another one of these in our house. Capresso should step up and refund anyone who purchased this model and apologize.
1,Worst coffee maker possible!!,"I was excited to receive this coffee maker after reading all the positive reviews. I immediately unpacked it, and started to make a pot of coffee. The way this unit is designed, the thermal carafe must be pushed against the main unit to push in a button on the bottom. The force of the button kept pushing the carafe away from the unit, thus stopping the brewing. I dont know how anyone can possibly brew coffee with this unit...maybe mine was defective....sent it back day after receiving. Very cumbersome and ugly unit, also. DONT BUY!"
3,Capresso review,"The coffee maker is impressive to look at but the size of the machine, compared to the amount of coffee made, is disproportionate on a crowded counter top. It makes good coffee and keeps it warm. The coffee filter holder can be fiddly to place unless you get it just right, but the fact that the coffee dribbles down the front of the machine every time, requiring it be placed on a pad, is a real pain. The front needs cleaning every time, no matter how good you connect the jug with the machine. I'm concerned that the coffee running down the front of the machine will eventually cause damage to the seam between the stainless steel casing and the plastic bottom? I don't know if I have a lemon or they are all like that? *******4-month review***** My concerns came true. The dribbling coffee and condensation has damaged the seam at the bottom and the auto shut-off switch now gets stuck in when I remove the jug, so this makes dribbling a bigger problem. I would not but this again."
5,Makes GREAT Coffee,"We bought this over a month ago and we absolutely love the coffee it makes. Seeing the other reviews about problems with dripping and cleaning -- we really haven't experienced those problems. Yes, the coffee holder needs to be put in ""just so"", but the benefits of the great coffee far outweigh any minor quirks it has. I highly recommend it and think most people will be pleased."
2,"Good Coffee, fair coffee maker","Makes good coffee but if I had it to do over again, I'd just buy a good drip maker and save the money. Cleaning is the biggest problem. I don't have a problem of coffee dripping down the front, but steam coming from the pot during the brewing process causes it to collect and drip down the front of the maker. If you don't remove it when the brewing cycle is complete, steam continues to condense and drip. The steam also forms on the lid of the brewer. When you open the top, it runs to the back of the lid and drips down the back of the brewer. Another contribution to water under the base. Cleaning the pot is also a pain.Bottom line: I'd rather have a good drip maker and a good stainless carafe. Lot cheaper too..."
1,Capresso ST600,"Don't waste your hard earned money on this particular coffee maker. I have had mine less than one year and I am here shopping for another because the ST600 just stopped working. I echo all the reviews regarding the poor quality of this machine. It is constantly drippy, the lid randomly pops open, and because of all the water, the pot will move away from the main brewer. It is hard to know how much water is in the machine and it is grossly oversized. I have had other capresso's and will be returning to the other model I have purchased before."
4,monolithic but great performer,"Great coffee but takes a bunch of counter space. People who say it's hard to use are...well, wrong. We haven't had any trouble. The auto-start is hard to set when you are exhausted at midnight, but outside of that, this is a great value."
5,No problem whatsoever,"After reading reviews of all the thermal coffee makers, I was left with no real choices, so decided to try this one. I don't know what the problem is with all the negative reviews. Never leaked, always hot. Only problem is that even though it fit under my cabinets, I worried that the steam would damage them, so now it resides on my kitchen island.Hope this one doesn't break in 1 year like the Cuisinart, as I love this coffee maker. The price couldn't be beat!"
1,WARNING,"WARNING! This beauty is not worth $10. It is so poorly engineered it is shocking. First, the pot will not stay put for the brewing process unless you back it up to the wall or something to hold it in place. The beautiful lid starts to pop up unexpectedly every 5 or 6 uses, no matter how conscientious you are about closing it right. It bought it for $39- it isn't worth trying to overcome it's engineering flaws just to make a pot of coffee.It still looked pretty when I threw it into the dumpster!W"
1,If you don't speak French look elsewhere,"They never mention that it doesn't have English subtitles. If you don't speak French, pass this one by! It's probably a wonderful movie if you can understand what's going on."
4,don't believe everything you see,"This book is fairly comprehensive (he even discusses morphing in film and video, along with the legal aspects of altering photographs) and absolutely fascinating, though I would have liked to see him go into more depth regarding UFOs and photos of anomalous creatures (there is only one photo of a stupid-looking ""sea monster"" when he could have had his pick from dozens of photos of Nessie, Yeti, aliens, etc). He also claims the infamous photo of Lee Harvey Oswald holding the rifle and pamphlets was not faked in any way (the author used to work for the CIA-- conspiracy theorists can make of that what they will). Definitely worth a read. ..."
3,Help for Congregations,"I sing in our church choir. It pains me to watch the faces of members of the congregation when the pastor introduces a new hymn. If the tune is unfamiliar or the poetry obscure, the folks look baffled. They remind me of a Mexican-American kid I tutored in English: He could read in a halting fashion, but could not tell me the meaning of what he had just read!This will not happen to pastors who introduce to their congregations the hymn texts and tunes offered in John A. Dalles' ""Swift Currents and Still Waters: 65 Hymn Texts."" Dalles' texts are straight-forward; he uses familiar phrases and comfortable metaphors. The tunes he suggests should be as familiar to church-goers as the backs of their hands.Pastors and congregations should be grateful for such accessible hymns!John C. Purdy, Santa Fe, NM"
2,"Exciting vocal arrangements, but very poor sound",Kay Thompson is an amazing vocal arranger and singer and it is wonderful to hear her at the top of her craft. The cd on the other hand suffers from poor sound quality. This cd has been recorded from an out of print album and pops and skips along. It is really too bad because it distracts from the performance. I hope that some time in the future they will release the material from the original source.
3,Just okay,I promptly received he item but there are several pages missing including photos and sheet music. I don't remember this was said in the posting.
5,Endless fun for a child!,"I had My Pal 2 when I was a child and I loved it so much! He was by far my fav toy. I have been looking for one lately and they are so hard to come by. If anybody knows how I could find myself one as I see they are unavailable on amazon too, please let me know?! Thanks."
2,"Kermit has way better albums..,",Kermit is way better than this... Skip this one - and try some of the more recent releases...
2,Dissapointing,"Imagine reviewing a cd because you liked a group in concert? What about the merits of the cd itself... or lack of as in the case of this. I love Kermit Ruffins and got turned onto him when I first heard his trumpet on Harry Connick Jr.'s latest cd. I bought the BBQ Swingers live cd which is great and that is why this is so dissapointing. When Kermit is playing his horn, this cd jumps, but when he stops and sings... forget it. HIs voice is well suited to a certain style, but the fact that he sings on (I believe) all the songs herin really bogs down this cd. I wish he just played - maybe sang on a couple. Everytime you get moving to this cd, he begins to sing and it is like a car coming to an abrupt halt. Very dissapointing"
5,"THE VERY BEST ""LIVE STORY"" I HAVE EVER READ!","THIS SERIES IS DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE,THIS STORY HAS IT ALL LOVE,HATE,RIVETING ACTION AND EVEN HORROR.AT TIMES U FEEL LIKE YOUR ACTUALLY LIVING THE LIFE OF A VAMPIRE AND THE EXPERIENCES OF THE REAL LIFE OF A CREATURE THAT IS SO COMPASSIONATE FOR OTHERS SAFETY AND LOVED THE PART WHEN THE GUYS SAY ""I DONT WANT TO DIE AND THEN SHE SAYS ""THEN YOU SHOULN'T HAVE BEEN BORN.EVEN THOUGH I AM GUY IT WAS REALLY COOL.CHRISTOPER PIKE HOPE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT SITA IN THE FUTURE OR SOON."
5,"One of the best vampire books out, better than Anne Rice!","A good book that puts a new twist on the vampire myth. Changed the vampire from a seductive corpse to a seductive immortal. It even gave an interesting origin for vampires never seen before. The main element of the vampires was not the only thing. It was like how a vampire would live in real life(if only I could write like that). It was an incredible book but the ending was anti-climaxtic with the character meeting a sad ending. I wish there had been real vampires after reading that. Luckily for Pike vampire fans, in the summary at the first story of Christopher Pike collection in the book Tales Of Terror, he hints there would be more books about the early years of Sita. Until then, Sita lives forever!!!"
2,"It's not a Karaoke collection, it's a Sing Along DVD","I'm a Huge Westlife Fan, and I bought this DVD so I can sing my favorite songs but It's not a Karaoke Collection, It just has the videos and the lyrics. The name of the product is wrong, it should be named Westlife SingAlong Collection.If you want the Westlife Videos in a DVD with lyrics, buy it, if you want a Karaoke collection this is not a product for you U_U"
5,Westlife: The Karaoke Collection.,"If you want to use the karaoke option, you can turn the singer's vocal off by pressing the Audio button on the remote control. Great item."
5,Westlife Karaoke Collection,The Westlife Karaoke Collection arrived in perfect condition and was very clear when played on my dvd player. It had all of Westlife's hits with great lyrics and audio sound. I would definately recommend this dvd to an avid fan of Westlife; especially those fans who like to sing along as well!!
3,"Ok book, not that much information.","Was hoping for some greater information on how to ""Hit Hard and Fast in Combat"". He presented extremely basic approaches to shooting. Can sum up the book with 1) Stance, 2) Aim, and 3) Shoot all threats. That's it. No in depth on scenarios etc. If you are looking for a quick summary of the basics, this book is for you."
3,Contains ascorbic acid,"Note the product description says ""...to ensure less irritation on the stomach."" This product contains ascorbic acid. Can't tell from the ingredients what percentage. Not what I have been taking or what I was looking for in a purely ascorbate vitamin C. Not having tried yet, can't express an opinion on effect on stomach. Again, just not what I wanted."
3,Easy Reading,Overall the book is very easy to follow if you are new to Philosophy world. I recommend this book to those getting into philosophy or if you just want a good overview of philosophy without getting lost in the literature. Philosophers are presented in chronological order: it starts with Socrates and ends in the present.
5,Great fictional tale based on many true events that happened,"I was really impressed by this fictional tale of a journey into self-discovery. I think the author did a very nice job of taking events that really happened to him or his friends during his stay in Senegal, West Africa for the Peace Corps and wove them into a fictional tale that draws the reader in and leaves them wondering ""What happens to Will?"". The rumor is book 2 is in the making........A great value for the read."
3,Marina 2-in-1 Fish Hatchery,"Gets the job done. There is a newer version of this product by Top Fin that includes suction cups, which allow you to anchor the hatchery to your tank wall.In terms of isolating fry from ravenous adults... this product is only so-so. If you have any sort of predatory fish in your tank that are capable of sucking, fry will be instantly gobbled up through the slots on the side (narrow enough to prevent them from swimming out of the hatchery, but not narrow enough to prevent them from being eaten by outside fish).A good option for isolating injured or aggressive adult fish (the separators are easy to add/remove)."
3,Good but should have some improvement,"I was a serious hobbyist that used to have 9 tanks and a pond about 10 years ago. Now down to 4 tanks only. I have one of this before and love it and use all the time for betta, sick, injure, new fish that wait to settle. It work as Hatchery for guppy, small platy or moon fish, but feel that too small/shallow for molly of bigger livebearers. If your spiceman is big, then baby fish may be also too big and can not go thru the gap to the bottom. I hope it will come with a cover like the smaller version does, but it is durable and useful and must have for any reason."
5,Fun and Very Challenging,"If you love a puzzle challenge, this may be the puzzle for you. It's not for the faint-hearted, though! I used my kitchen table plus cookie sheets for sorting different colors, which helped with the size issue. It's Ravenburger, my favorite puzzle brand, so it's sturdy and durable, and the pieces fit perfectly together."
5,No complaints here...,"Great looking watch, outstanding price, I can't give you a reason not to buy this watch if you're looking for a nice watch."
1,Not the Recordings Used in the Films,"Buyers should be aware that at least some of the recordings on this CD are NOT the versions used in the films. So if you're looking for the specific recording used, this CD is probably not going to help."
5,EXCELLENT,"Having been into old Corvettes since the mid 70's, I was excited to see such a large and cohesive collection of actual FACTS which are missing from some of todays Corvette publications. It also makes for good reading, as the stories unfold you are taken to ""way back when"". Of special note is the feature on #003, the oldest surviving Corvette."
5,"Any automotive history holding will find this a lively, appealing collection","THIS OLD CORVETTE: THE ULTIMATE TRIBUTE TO AMERICA'S SPORTS CAR gathers stories from respected Corvette historians, automotive journalists, owners and more and compliments these accounts with period artwork and current photos to make for an outstanding celebration of the Corvette's influence. Any automotive history holding will find this a lively, appealing collection."
1,Leaking Mess,"Makes good coffee BUT... every once in a while coffee will no drop into the pot, it just flows over the sides on to the heating plate and then onto the counter top. At first I thought it had some buildup since it sees a lot of use, nope no rhyme or reason will just dump a load of coffee onto the counter top if you're not watching it. Amazon should have negative star for products this bad."
2,Don't waste your money,"This is my second Kitchenaid coffeemaker, the first one was replaced with this one due to faulty electrical. (Yes, sounds scary) This consistently brews coffee all over our counter, the cleaning light is on all the time,and it does not brew a hot cup of coffee. Upside to this, is I like the signal beep when it is done and the clock showing how long the coffee has been sitting for (30, 60 90 min ) Overall, I expected a 100.00 dollar coffeemaker to last more than 8 months. I bought a Cuisinart to replace this after reading the good reviews on that. Stick with mixers KitchenAid, your coffeemakers leave a lot to be desired."
1,Messy,"This makes great coffee but can be very messy. The water resevoir and the coffee grounds are placed under the same lid. If by chance you put a little too much water in or a too many grounds, the grounds end up in the water resevoir and it is hard to clean. I like my grounds and the water in their own seperate compartments.This is my 4th KitchenAid coffeemaker in 3 years. I have had other problems with this maker and it always seemed to break down on me under its warranty period.I'm very frustrated with this coffeemaker and am looking to purchase anything but a KitchenAid."
1,It broke!,It broke the instant I turned it on. I am not quite sure why that happened. I didn't return it because it wasn't worth the cost of shipping. ( in my opinion!)
2,Not that good,"There are only a couple of things that I like about this toothbrush:1) It is really quiet... more a humming sound than a buzzing sound.2) It's nice and compact like a regular toothbrushThe Negatives:1) The bristles do not rotate so it's basically a manual toothbrush that hums.2) The price on Amazon was inflated. I found it elsewhere for $4.99 but I'd already used the one I bought on Amazon.If you really care about getting that nice electric toothbrush feel, this isn't the toothbrush for you. I'll be going back to my Oral-B toothbrush even if it is louder than this one."
5,Megan from Ashley River Creative Arts El.,The book Jin Woo tells a story with words but you don't have to look at the words. It's just as good with the illustrations. The illustrations show brilliant and life like pictures. Bright and beautiful illustrations can really catch one's eye. Chris's pictures are the best. I love his creative pictures. I give it five stars.
5,Necessity for any tank...,"I bought several of these to add to tanks where I was having tank-cycling issues (due to lack of a stable bio-media in my HOB filters, I believe). After much research, it seems that many fish enthusiasts insist on added sponge filters for stability. There were actually not many brands that I could find, nor recommendations. I decided to try these in combination with my HOB filters and I am glad I did... I now have no more cycling issues in any tank that has one of these. These are suitable for 10-gallons and up (I do not think that they would fit in a rectangular 5-gallon)... though I would get the double sponge filter for overstocked tanks. As for maintenance, I only have to squeeze out the organic matter from the sponge once a month in the bucket with the siphoned water from the tank during a regular cleaning. I would guess that the sponges will need to be changed at least once a year as they are already much softer than when they were installed."
3,loud,"I'm using the double sponge filter for my 20gal tank to supplement my HOB power filter. This is my first sponge filter so the following things I say may be naive or incorrect, however I expected the sponges to pick up more stuff in my goldfish tank. I squeeze out the sponges every week with my water change. my HOB filter is always super dirty, but the sponges don't seem to have much dirt in them, so I'm now cleaning them every other week.My main gripe, and the reason for the 3 stars, is this thing is LOUD. there is an adjustable upside down L shaped tube that the instructions say to keep half submerged for best results. Due to the construction of the tube, the air creates an annoying whistling sound, whether I keep it half submerged, fully submerged, or out of the water completely. So i'm just not using the tube at all and letting the bubbles come straight up out of the core tube of the filter.Looking back (and forward) I would probably go with the hydro sponge filters"
3,Works but noisy,Filter works fine. I use an air pump rated for tanks 40-60 gallons. I bought this one to use in my 10 gallon quarantine tank. The filter is so noisy that I moved the tank to a back room. I bought a small HOB filter to replace it.
2,Too Loud.,I just installed this filter today and I can't get over how terribly loud the thing is. I have had my fish tank for many years and this is the first time I ever purchased a filter that made so much noise. I don't think I will ever purchase this again.
1,Buyer Beware!,"Filters look great in the product pictures, however once received, filters were defective. Notice I said filters. I ordered 3 of them and all 3 had the exact same manufacturing defect! If it were only one I could understand, but all 3? This is just a cheaply made product and Hagen should be embarassed of putting their name on such a cheaply made Chinese knockoff! Thankfully the seller refunded the purchase price of the filters.Buyer beware!"
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
3,"Great Premise, Failed Execution","The premise of the book is excellent. Don't cram every project into a one-size fits all methodology. Recognize the software development lifecycle (SDLC) can range from a linear waterfall method to pure agile. The unique characteristics of your business environment and your project determine what approach is appropriate.I would give 5 stars if the author had presented this idea, provided his summary of the SDLCs and outlined his SDLC selection approach. The idea seems simple, but it is important and often missed.Unfortunately, he follows with hundreds of pages detailing basic theory of project management, customized slightly for each SDLC. The resulting repition is highly confusing (due to the minor variations) and ensures the reader will remember nothing more than the first few chapters of the book.Read the first section and skip the rest. The details of a SDLC are only learned through experience."
3,Didn't impress too much,"Didn't impress me too much. But I am a hard person for that. And I am too practical, to see huge value in too-much-general-knowledge-and-theory book. It's not that book is bad or something. Just it was not for me."
3,Good message,The message was good but the acting was jus OK. I would say to get it so you can enjoy the story but not if you are picky about quality acting.
2,Very Disappointed,"If you were thinking about buying this play, save your money because it isn't worth it. The story was choppy and didn't flow well and some of the acting was horrible. If I could return this movie I would."
2,Bad TV Series,"The previews looked really good..Instead, I was watching a bad tv series. It had a live audience, slow, I thought it was suppose to be a movie. Then suddenly one of the guys would burst into song....??? very confusing. I do not recommend nor waste my time watching it again."
3,"Could have been a lot better ... Just ""Ok""","I have watched this a couple of times now, and it grows on you ... LOL. The meaning behind the message was good. Clifton Powell is really showing up ALL over the place these days. I do wish that instead of trying to imitate what we have already seen (with other writers), maybe they should work on being authentic with story lines and characters. It should have had more singing or just none at all. It was just okay for me."
4,Good alternative to OEM water pump,"There seem to be 3 types of water pumps for the E30: 1) pumps with plastic impellars that break down over time, 2) race oriented pumps with lifetime warranties, and 3) pumps with metal impellars. The Bosch 97106 has a metal impellar, which should last until the next timing belt, if not longer, and at a good discount off the german equivalent.Fit was spot on. The gasket was fine.Finish was adequate. There was some extra casting flash on the outside (nothing that effected the sealing/mating surface).I would recommend this product for any E30 with the M20 engine."
1,Worst O'Reilly book I have.,"O'Reilly generally distributes well written, easy to understand books. This is not one of them. The author seems to go to great lengths to make the implementation of RPC's hard to understand. For example, he never seems to plainly describe the sequence of events required to register a server and a client. Instead he requires the user to rely on the rpcgen utility which is OK if you have a simple requirement. However, most people who use RPC's use them because their requirements are NOT simple. Further, if the reader wants to learn more about the RPC procedure he/she must filter out Mr. Bloomers' convoluted 'C' code. In his very first example (downloaded from the O'Reilly web site), Mr. Bloomer forces the reader to muddle through code like: ""char *result; char *(*local)(); local = (char *(*)()) add_record; result = (*local)(&argument, rqstp); "" without any explanation of what he is trying to accomplish. I wish I could get my money back from O'Reilly on this one."
4,good reference,"This is a decent book. Its a reference book, so reading it for pleasure might not exactly work. But if you want to know how to use RPC - this is the book for you. It answered all my questions and was an valuable reference."
1,Old and in need of Update,"I feel that this book needs to be updated. It makes so many statements that even a newbie such as I can tell are outdated, that the entire content of the book is cast into doubt. How can I tell whether or not I should believe any given sentence? I find myself in the position of needing to independently verify almost every statement, and who has time for that? I came here hoping for a newer edition that I could feel more confident about, and am very disappointed not to find one. Judging from other references (e.g. the Solaris 8 ""ONC+ Reference Manual,"" at docs.sun.com -- on the topic of using RPC with threads, for example), the technology has changed over the last 12 years, to the point where I for one don't trust this book."
1,I would not recommend this book for RPC beginners,The presentation is very informal and brief. It is very hard for a beginner to have a clear picture of RPC by reading this book.
1,bloody awful,This is possibly the worst pile of trash I have EVER read in my life. Please don't buy this complete pile of rubbish. In fact I think I'm going to wipe my backside with it.
1,"Ordered one thing, received another","I ordered a Meridian 8009 by MERIDIAN... Received a Meridian 8009 by AASTRA!! That was not what I expected, and not according to their description."
5,AMERICAN SUBLIME,"I purchased this book as soon as I could afford it! I love the White Mountain School of art as an offshoot of the Hudson River School, and this is a must-have for those enthusiasts of this great American school of landscape painting. Here in North Conway, we are seeing a resugence from those collectors who are now searching down paintings from that era, and we will soon have an exhibit at the new state building at the Intervale Overlook--where many of the old artists painted this scene of the pastoral views towards Mt. Washington.I wrote an Art History paper using this book and others as references, and it is available at the Conway, NH library. Albert Bierstadt's famous painting of North Moat Mountain was painted from this locale. It is on the cover of Bob McGrath's book, GODS IN GRANITE, and is available as a print from the Currier Gallery in Manchester, NH."
3,OK,"As a Christian, I wanted a more precise ASL bookon Christian signs. But, it is great if you desirea variety of religious signs in your vocabulary."
5,great book!,Received very quickly. This book is great for those fluent in ASL or those who are learning ASL. It provides a spiritual connection to the deaf community
3,Religious Signing,"This book was not really what I was looking for, I need more of a dictionary. It did help with the Lord's Prayer"
2,Not what it is cracked up to be...,"I bought this book, but I was really disappointed with (3) things in particular. It does NOT have an index in the back, so if you are looking for a particular word you will not be able to find it; (2) If you do find the word and go to the word it refers you to another word rather than give you all the words for that sign (3) All the religious signs are all mixed in together they are not broken up into religious categories, deciphering between Catholic, Christian, Jewish and Muslim signs found to be too confusing and time consuming for my use. With all that being said, sorry to say I returned it and purchased Leo Yates Jr, Pocket Reference of Religious Signs."
4,A Great Source,"As a certified sign language interpretor who started interpreting services six years ago, this book has proved an invaluable resource to me personally and an excellent teaching tool for church service interpretors.The illusrations and written instructions for each sign are excellent. The range of signs given is impressive.However there are a few drawbacks.First the appendixes of prayers are given in Signed English and NOT ASLSecondly there are many, many signs which are not universally recognized. (I am thinking specifically of Presbyterian - which I have never seen signed in the manor discribed. And alternate form of Christian given is ""JESUS"" + Person Marker. Again I have never seen Christian signed any other way but ""CHRIST"" + Person Marker.But all-in-all the book is a wonderful resource to anyone ineresed in deaf minisitry."
4,A must for any signer,"Most of the people I know who learn sign language get into it for providing help in their church or something similar. The drawings and content are excellent and you need this book if you DO fit in the category I just mentioned. Some years back, I would have given this 5-stars, but I think times have changed and video formats are the best way to go to learn signing, so I docked it a point."
5,A wonderful reference book,"This is a clearer, easier to read version of sign language. It is especially delightful to be able to find words of worship and praise which I couldn't find in my other sign language books and the price is right also! Thank you."
2,Leo Strikes Again!,"Well, well, well. The man who claims to have deciphered the Phystos Disk, and other undeciphered texts, strikes again! either Mr. Leo is a genius, or else he is wrong. I will let you judge. In this volume, he claims that the word ISIS is a key word appearing in code throughout the text, and thus claims the text as a Cathari heresy and a textbook for Isis cult worship. I would put more stock in his decipherings if they were not all based in the supernatural, magic, and aliens."
3,Unusual heroine,"This is the first of the Superromance series I have seen in which the heroine, in her thirties, is a now-controlled alcoholic and not the totally ""innocent"" party in the ending of her first marriage and tensions over custody with her ex-husband and his second wife. The new opportunity for love which presents itself is also threatened by her past history. Although the concept is challenging, the presentation left me not particularly caring about the two protagonists."
5,Great Product from Preschool Prep,"Love the videos. I bought the four Spanish videos Conoce los Numeros, Conoce las Letras, Conoce las Figuras y Conoce los Colores, when my oldest son was 18 months and a few weeks after he started pointing at colors, shapes, number and letters. And the best part is that you can play the videos both in Spanish and English."
3,Leap in the Dark,"When a stranger kednaps Ginny and the two children she's temporarily looking after, Ginny doesn't know where to turn for comfort. All her instincts tell her to turn to Ross hamiltion-but he's the man holding them captive."
5,very pleased,This book is great in addition to the Mas alla lab book and CDs. It arrived very quickly and in excellent shape.
5,Hummingbirds favorite,"Have had other types of feeders but the hummingbirds seem to this style of feeder, Also like the smaller size as we change the water frequently."
1,Cute but...,"I like the look of this feeder and it adheres well to windows. However, for some unknown reason the hummers do not use it. I placed it next to one of my feeders that is used by the hummers so that they could become accustomed to the new ones appearance. This did not work. I have left it up and change the nectar as I do my other feeders but it still goes unused.Even the bees do not come to the feeder."
1,humming bird feeder,The first time I cleaned and refilled the joint in the bottom green well leaked. Sugar water dripped out around the seam. Very cheaply made. Had to throw away after 1 use
4,BLACK CAB is my favorite recent pop song,"I heard the mp3 of ""Black Cab"" at the Secretly Canadian website, and I was immediately smitten -- it reminded me a bit of Velvet Underground and Nico, if Lou Reed was the one with the thick accent. The rest of the songs on this, and the Rocky Dennis EP, are all pretty impressive, but ""Black Cab"" is an instant classic."
5,a philsoophical gem--against reducing human beings to things,"I am a fan of this apparently too little known and appreciated philosopher. I've studied Olafson's 1987 and 1995 books for years. He shows brilliantly why the usual ""scientific"" explanations of the nature of perception, language, and person are impoverished, inadequate, indeed logically incoherent--a highly unpopular position in our scientific age! His critiques of scientism are great (I do have the credentials to make this judgement), though I do have some problems with his proposals for alternative approaches. Also, his syntax sometimes needs unscrambling--too many nested clauses, ambiguous pronouns--but it's worth the effort. This book is a concise, clear, and efficient summary of his previous work, especially of his 1995 book, and has some new ideas too. Don't just read it, study it--and approach it with an open mind. It is meaty and valuable. Chap.5 alone, ""What does the brain do?"", is worth the price of admission. ..."
4,great resource,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who enjoys speaking in public. I use this and Bottled Wisdom:Over 1,000 Spirited Quotations and Anecdotes by Mark Pollman as resources for entertaining quotes."
1,Nothing to write home about,"I bought this CD because I own everything Sabbath CD and tributes. Paid retail. The singing is terrible, she has some voice inflections that dont fit the music, similar to talking funny instead of singing. The music itself is ok. Song selection is poor, the same old iconic nuggets (good songs but nothing surprising or thinking outside the box) Would have love to hear some different stuff like Zero The Hero. You'll probably be surprised by my recomendation to buy it. Buy it used, and only if you are a completist Sabbath fan. Otherwise, give it a pass. Don't fall for the cover shot ""sex sells"" gimmick."
4,Madeline software is delightful,"My daughter has an earlier Madeline computer program, and it has been the best we've bought. Unlike Reader Rabbit, which I think can be frustrating for small children because it takes so long to ""win"" the game by collecting items, the Madeline program builds smaller, more easily attainable arenas for success. Plus, the program grows with the child. We bought ours when she was not quite three; at five years old, she can still enjoy it using the higher level activities."
2,If Only It Were That Simple,This book was really an insult to my intelligence. Where did she get her PH.D from a Cracker Jack box? Her book is page after page of stereotypical cliches! I CAN NOT believe that made a comment about Tommy Hilfiger appearing on Oprah saying that he didn't want black people wearing his clothes. If that isn't the oldest urban legend. Come on! Was there no fact checking involved in this process? Then she says that black women need to learn to embrace themselves as God made them and then turns around and says if you don't like your hair alter it!What a waste of money! Hide this book from your impressionable teenage daughters!
5,I really couldn't put the book down. Read it all in maybe one days time.,"Awesome. That is all I can say. When I first read this book, I was hesitant, thinking I was reading a book maybe only for girls, or maybe just some weird chicks diary that she had published. Man was I wrong! If anything guys, let this book be a guide to what is going on inside the minds of single women everywhere. It is almost like you are reading Kerri's inner monolgue as you turn page after page waiting to see what in the world happens next. Who knew that truth could be as interesting as fiction? Well this girl, Kerri knew and put it all down on paper. Not only that, but she is pretty freakin' funny as well!I more than recommend this book. Now, I had better get back to sassysingles.net before they automatically log me out!"
4,One of the best Christian Comedians,I highly recommend this book for any single gal - or for anyone wanting to chuckle at memories of being single and the struggles that ensued.
2,Very little light from two big batteries,"I can't believe how dim this thing is. I had a little tap-light that was much brighter. Now I have both. Almost one star, but it does, in fact, work. A little bit."
1,Worthless,These lights are worthless. You have to light a match to see if they are burning. I threw them away.
2,I'm finally bored with John Thorne,"I really enjoyed John Thorne's other books, but when I read this one I was bored. He has been publishing for a number of years, and you'd think he would grow and change, expand his awareness, try something new. Instead, I get the feeling his life is shrinking and that he is becoming a miserly, curmudgeonly northeastener who is living a narrow and deprived life out of choice rather than necessity. He moved from a small town to a bigger city, but he hasn't changed much, still the narrow anal focus on the details of simple recipes. Living with him must be mind-numbingly boring. I wonder if his wife ever wants to scream and run out of the house? So obviously my advice is, skip this one and reread one of the earlier ones."
5,Moonfire,"What can I say, Linda Lael Miller does it again. I really enjoyed it. Good story, strong characters and a very enjoyable read."
2,Disappointing,"I agree 100% with ""bookworm"". This first part of this book was great but once the ""love?"" scenes began that's all there was, over, and over and over again. The story ended and the erotica took over. I am not opposed to steamy sex scenes, but this was just the same description time after time. It actually became a little boring and I couldn't understand why our heroine was so impressed. Kept waiting to get back to the story but it never happened. Compared to other books by Miller, this one was very disappointing."
3,it wasn't as good as her other books,"i just wasn't as impressed with this book as the others of hers i have read. not sure why, but maybe it was just the mood i was in. it was still a good read just not what i was expecting. everyone's different though!"
2,no good,"I've had a different flax seed grinder that works really well. This one has a really low output if used at the finest setting, and if you want a higher output you don't have well ground seeds! This was a real dissapointment, especially at the high price."
4,"Highly functional, limited database","Speaking feature is quite clear and can be used in a pinch in any language. Basic phrases are well maintained and accurate. Direct translation is fine for common words, but dictionary is not exhaustive, especially if translating from a language into english (it works better english to x). All in all a very useful device and quite portable and durable. Recommended for those who are not already proficient in some of the languages."
2,"muddy sound, opaque search interface","I am unimpressed with this item. The sound quality is very low, though it is better when you use the earpiece. It is very difficult to decipher what you are hearing in any language- I am familiar with four that are included in this dictionary's package. When you are searching for a word you often find interesting words as a result, but not always the one you are looking for. When you look up a word that has more than one interpretation there is no indication of which meaning the word you are given is in accord with."
1,Save your money,Please do not waste your time . The unit was defective from the start. Not easy to use. Return service very hard. After 2 weeks and a freight loss of $27.00 I recieved a credit Do not buy!5 stars on all of my other purchases from Amazon The Dero
2,Poor acoustics.,"The acoustics are very ""tinny."" Also, basic phrases like ""can you help me?"" can't be found. Save your money for a mini laptop."
2,don't like it,"the sound was bad,and shipping was very slow!!!whenever you type in one word,it always give you a phrase,and speak so qucik that I can't even catch it, i don't like it and want to return it..."
4,O.K.,Purchased the translator for my son who is teaching English in China this Summer. He tells me that he is well pleased with the item and that it has been a great help.
4,Hanging solution...,"We LOVE these adorable wall hangings. However, there is the problem of how on earth to hang them! We've decided to use a clear fishing wire through the rod panel and then hang off either a painted nail to blend w/the wall, or maybe a decorative hook. They're lightweight enough to be held up with a thumbtack(w/the wire). We may use a ribbon if we're able to get it through the tiny rod opening. Except for the poorly thought out hanging issue..why isn't there just a loop?!?.....these are wonderful decorations. Lots of different textures, etc."
5,Zanzibar Wall Hanging Purchase,The ordering process was easy and it was delivered in a timely manner.
4,enjoyable and educational experience,A very worthwhile DVD not only for its musical quality but very well done presentation on the composition and the composer
1,I may be the only person to have this but...,This is a CD of Nazi war songs not the slow maching songs of the Legion. Many in the SS fleing the Allies joined the Legion and brought Nazi traditions with them. I thought I was getting this item for Amazon and didn't realize I was getting it from Third Reich Books a pro Nazi orgonization. First Amendment aside I was ashamed I gave these people money.
2,It's not for busy people,This book is not for busy people. The book is almost written completly in Hirigana. If you haven't mastered this your sunk. The CD is not much help as well. Much too fast with very little explination.
5,great study tool,"I use this book to teach beginners, very easy to understand, covers some cultural aspects as well as some minor grammer, CD works directly with the lessons, would reccomend pairing book with the Japanese For Busy People workbook"
4,good for beginners,This book is easy to follow. It's a good book for beginners who have already mastered kana. I wish there's kanji with furigana for pronunciation as well. The included CD is helpful for listening to native Japanese speakers.
3,Be Careful,"Be careful when you order this book. I am learning Hiragana but I am not yet fluent enough to read it quickly. I should have bought the Romaji version. I will keep the Kana version until I am better at reading.The book comes with an audio CD. The spoken language is way too fast. I have to play it backwards and forwards several times to understand what they are saying. I acknowledge that you need to learn to understand a new language at normal speaking speed, but when I am a raw beginner, it would be very helpful to slow it down just a bit, until I get the hang of it.I try to listen to it while I am driving. This does not work very well, as you need to read the book, while you are listening to it.Having said all this, please don't be deterred, and stick with your Japanese language. Good Luck."
5,very good book,It was delivered quickly and the book looked brand new with the cd included. This is a very good book if you are a beginner like me. Even if you don't have a japanese teacher you can easly follow the exercise with the cd.
3,AJALT confusion!!,"These books are actually very handy learning tools. What frustrates me is how many version there are!! I got the romaji verison of volume I a few years back, but I grew frustrated with all the English characters in it. After all, the only way to practice kana is by reading it. So I recently decided to order volume I in the Kana version, but it's not even remotely the same book. How often to they change this book, like every year? It's completely different material!! It's confusing to know which workbook goes with which volume and so on and so forth. I wish this company would be more clear about all the different verison available and what goes with each volume, b/c the exercises in them are really helpful."
2,Hopalong Waltzidy,"It's difficult for an orchestra to screw up the familiar ""everyman"" classics-- those works that have been the staple of Sunday afternoon band concerts for generations, and although the personnel on WALTZFEST! come perilously close to disaster several times, they don't quite get there.One thing that's noticeable with every mediocre orchestra is an inability to play 16th note (or faster) runs in unison. There's plenty of blurring and slurring on this album-- and when things really get going, its ""everyman"" for himself! Think: potato sack race, or a waltzer with one leg shorter than the other, and you'll have the general idea.But were you REALLY expecting the Berlin Philharmonic at these prices?"
2,A little too flimsy,"the knife is a little too flimsy for practical application drills. Given how flimsy it is, it doesn't make a good knife for disarming drills or even simulated combat.if you're running full speed drills and worried about injury, this knife is for you. If you're looking for something for disarming drills or simulated combat, get a cold steel practice knife."
1,Do Not Order From Amazon,"The knife is fine, but do not order from Amazon. The entity that actually sells the product is Martial Arts Mart. They charged me $7 to ship this $3 rubber knife!! I don't know whether to laugh or cry! I will never order anything from Martial Arts Mart."
5,great bike,GREAT BIKE FOR THE PRICE. MY GRTGRANDSON LOVES THIS BIKE AND HE IS 8 YRS. OLD. HE IS LEARNING TO DO TRICKS AND THIS BIKE IS REALLY GREAT TO LEARN ON. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE PRICE IS SO LOW FOR A MOGOOSE BIKE. WE WILL BE BUYING MONGOOSE BIKES FROM NOW ON!!
4,Decent Bike for the price,"Nice bike for the money. I was not expecting much for a +/-$120 bike. The bike was a little bit of a chore to assemble and has some cheap components, but overall is a good bike for the money."
2,Item Incomplete,The item was not properly packed and it arrived incomplete. The box had holes everywhere. I will never buy again with this provider.
5,6 STAR,Totally love this product it was everything I expected. The quality is gr8 and it arrived on time. I would definitely recommend this product.
1,Does anyone check the quality before it leaves the factory??,"First off, my husband, an engineer, has put together many, many bikes over the years!!! He and my 14 year old grandson got everything out of the box..........NO INSTRUCTIONS (how lovely and thoughtful)!! That was the first problem.......not to be deterred by the pesky inconvenience of having NO instructions, they continued following knowledge from past bike constuctiion projects. Things were moving slowly but moving until they tried to put the seat with the post into the frame!!! THE STEEL was deformed!!! Clearly a factory DEFECT!!!! Nothing can overcome this so now we get the exciting experience of taking the bike apart and putting all the pieces into the box AND the most fun of all is getting it to the place that will SEND IT BACK!!! Thank you for sharing this absolutely marvelous experience with common folk like us, who would surely get bored without it!!"
2,Junk.,Junk. Back brakes were defective out of the box. So i attempted to fix it and the Back brake cable broke with my finger barely holding it. after retighting the cable only one side of the brake works. The kick stand can't even hold up the bike properly Overall The picture gives the bike more justice to its overall look in person.
2,breaking,I got this bike and in under a month the pedals were breaking. In a month they broken so bad it was unridible. I bought new pedals and they didnt fit. Those pedals were the same size as every pair of high quality pedals. So if you want some good pedals you need new cranks that fit which usualy cost up to $50. I prefer not getting this bike if you dont want to pay an extra 50+ dollars in repair.
2,Disappointed!,"I'm 40yrs old and bought this bike for my 8yr old. Growing up, I remember being in love with Mongoose bikes. Unfortunately, the Mongoose bikes of today are nothing like they used to be.The bike came with missing parts ( misc bolts, screw to fasten the seat); the owner manual is NOT specific to the bike model; calls to customer service were answered by a call center person who is NOT at all familair with the bike.I guess this is the trade-off we must pay for having stuff manufactured cheaply overseas (China)."
5,Bike,I got this bike for my kid a x-mass. He said it's the best bike on theblock. His friends say it looks like the toughest and lite.I like it becouse it does look strounge and lite.
2,Nice Style for a Child; Manual Stinks!,My son (11 years old) LOVES this bike. I like the style but the manual sucks! It is not written in a manner that makes it clear which model it is referring to when detailing the various setups. I had a hard time figuring out the correct configuration for increasing the tension for the rear brakes..... my son eventually wrapped the line and used one of my hair bands to hold it to the handlebars to decrease the slack allowing enough tension for the rear brake to pull! I refuse to take this bike to the shop to pay upward of $100 for a $120 bike!
2,Extra Features Are a Waste,"When I was growing up I lusted after the Mongoose bike at the local bike shop. So, when it came time to order my son a ""big boy"" bike I got him this Mongoose. It's pretty amazing how over the years Mongoose has transformed itself from selling top notch bikes to selling rather cheap bikes. The pegs on this bike are just a waste. They're extremely heavy and just get in the way. Also, the gyro on this bike is pretty useless because it prevents the bike from braking effectively. Actually, the brakes are pretty useless because of the gyro mechanism. This isn't a freestyle bike to get for those parts at all. Weight wise, this bike is heavier than my big beach cruiser... But my son thinks the bike is cool and it rides just fine, so I kept it."
1,Death Star??,"Bought one a year ago. In a matter of weeks the power transformer died. Amazon replaced. Now, just beyond warranty, the power transformer on this one has died. Need I say more?"
3,You get what you pay for,"I've owned this receiver for about a year now.It's got a detailed, bright and precise sound. The controls are useful - having a remote is handy and the giant volume control on the unit itself is as intuitive as you need an amplifier to be.My gripes are:* Poor bass response unless you fiddle with the settings (which should not be necessary!)* I could not get it to bi-wire properly with my B&W; DM-602s even though the amp has two sets of speaker outputs. So I've had to twist my expensive four-core wire into two and cripple my beautiful speakers with inferior sound and bass/treble interference!* The radio doesn't seem to be able to scan stations automatically properly. This means I have to crawl through manually.All in all, my ancient Pioneer sounded far superior, as does anything by a ""proper"" hi-fi brand such as ARCAM or Marantz. I guess at this price it's what you might expect, but I have to say I'm disappointed and I'm already eager to get rid of it."
5,A Classic of Popular Mathematics,"With new mathematics growing wild in the trees in the new century, one should review those things that have given modern mathematics direction and flavor. This classic little book sits along side of Sawyer's "" Prelude to Mathematics"" as the go to books for basic understanding. To these books I have added an unlikely candidate "" Elliptical Curves"" by McKean and Moll. If one has these three books, he will have a crack in the dam of mathematics..."
1,What you worry about getting when you have never heard of the sequel to a movie,The quality of this DVD looks like something I could have created myself in my high school computer animation class. For the curious ones I'm watching it on a 50 inch Samsung DLP HDTV using a PS3 as the player. It's crap. The voices aren't even the same from the first one. It's spring...you'd be better off going outside and watching the grass grow than wasting your time on this one.
1,"Horible,Horribe,Horrible","My daughters and I hated this movie. They like watching children movies and so we decided to rent this one. My girl's hated how annoying the girls sounded, especially with the ""Holl-a"" and stopped watching halfway. Not only were the graphics horrible, but so was the story and writing! I swear my daughter's could've written a better script! This movie is certainly not worth anything over a dollar."
4,"Cute, Cute!",My little niece loved this!! Adorable characters and great animation. Great message for kids!
1,cheap computer animation,"The animation on the first HNA was really good. This one however is very hard on the eyes. It was done too quickly to move it into the market and it is really hard to watch. There is no depth at all.My four year old likes it, but the rest of the family had trouble with it. The jokes are ok, and at times the hidden humor is quite good and even clever, but over-all I can only give this a one star.On a side note, my four year old made a tough connection with one particular scene. In the film, the queen dies soon after a simple cough. Now, whenever my wife coughs, my daughter asks her, ""are you going to die, now?"" Ouch."
2,Not nearly as good as the first one...,If you liked the first movie then you'll most likely be disappointed at this second rate sequel.
4,better then the first one,The first happy never after movie put me to sleep this one actually had me entertained! I wish to know what soundtrack did they use! I love the music but cant find it anywhere! if you know plz email me kailarabbitt@yahoo.com
4,Fairy Tale Comedy,"This dvd is missing the voices and pizzaz of the first Happily N'Ever After, but overall this movie has it's funny attributes."
5,Great for kids,"My niece watched this movie with me and she loved it. It, like a lot of cartoon movies out there, had some adult humor. But it did not deter her from laughing and having fun with it. It's not as good as the first movie, but it still is in my libary of movies."
2,I thought my DVD player was going bad!!,"My son really like the 1st movie and so I ended up getting this one. I didn't remember the graphics being that bad and as this was the 2nd film, So therefore, I thought the graphics would be better of course. After reading a couple other review about the graphics being ""unfininshed"" I knew it was not my TV, My DVD player, or my eyes, my son said he could not tell anything was wrong (9 years old). I actually thouht I was ""seeing things"" the graphics were so ""unfinished"" and ""rough"" on this thing. On that aspect I was very dissappointed with this movie and found it very hard to ignore once I spotted it. I let it ruin the whole movie for me as I coulnd't shake it. The story was OK and I think my son still enjoyed it. But I really appreciate the artistry of CG movies like this one, so I was sorely disappointed. Hope this review helps. Samsung 50"" plasma and 1080p up-converting DVD player for what it's worth."
1,ugh...,"I really wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this movie for my girl. Biggest annoyances: the graphics look cheap, and the girl characters are irritating. We're not usually disappointed in these kind of kids' movies but this is the worst so far.We did enjoy the first one, tho."
2,Not quite Shrek,"This movie tries to follow in the footsteps of Shrek by taking an irreverent take on fairy tales and making references to many of the classics. However, where Shrek was hilarious, Happily N'Ever After doesn't. The story is irreverent but the plot and characters are pretty childish. The Snow White disco scene at the beginning was a bit too far. The princess act like a bunch of Paris Hilton wannabes. Moreover, the animation is pretty lousy compared to the standards of Shrek and Pixar. It looks like animation for a Saturday morning kid's show. Overall, not recommended."
3,Hard to belive,I find this book hard to belive first of all Lucy says her daughter looks just like her father Elvis I do not think she looks at all like Elvis from the pictures in the book. then she talks of her and Elvis always wanting to be together but when Elvis tells her over and over that they should be together then Lucy keeps saying no we can't. and then when Lucy says she was ready to tell Elvis about their daughter he passes away before she can tell him and the last thing that really got me was lucy was going to take her daughter to graceland to meet her grandfather Elvis's dad but again right before they are to go he also passes away. really! if Lucy really wants people to belive her story then her daughter should take a DNA test then we will all know the truth.
4,True or False?,"Ok, so did Lucy really know Elvis or didn't she?Well, I don't really think it matters because this book isn't about Elvis, it's about Lucy. It's about her tragic start in life and the beauty that she says she found.At the most, this is a true story which is unlikely to be proved and at the least it is a beautiful fictional love story.Worth a read if you're an Elvis fan - if even just to see how it compares to some of the RUBBISH that's been written by some of Elvis' 'friends'.I think it stands the test."
2,"Book is not believable, but not because of eye color","I read this book many years ago and I also did not find it believable, but not because of the eye color. It is possible for a brown-eyed person and blue-eyed person to conceive a green-eyed child. I have dk brown eyes, my husband has blue and one of our two children has green eyes. My father and grandmother both had green eyes which my son obviously inherited."
4,THE SPIRIT OF GOD'S HEART,"I've been searching for background music to stir up creativity while I work. These discs are by far the most used in my studio. Firey's use of guitar and piano sets the tone for a very uplifting, yet gentle counterpart to the Spirit's leading. Familiar hymns surface throughout and I'm glad I purchased these discs."
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAAAAAAAD!!!","This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and believe me, I've seen quite a few. It's like watching a TROMA movie without the gore, POLICE ACADEMY, and a MEXICAN SOAP at the same time. I think I can act better than the so called actors in this ""film"". You'll be better off watching a Robert Rodriguez film. Don't buy, don't rent it, don't even download it!!!"
4,Stands alone,"This movie stands alone. The story keeps your intreats even with the lack of high priced effects. I love the twists in the plot, and character development. Way above my expectations. I can't believe it was made with only $7,000. Imagine what this guy could do with a Hollywood budget? I look forward to seeing more from Suarez."
2,disappointed,"My 3 year old has Lilly's purple plastic purse and it is one of our favorite bedtime stories so I purchased Julius's candy corn and Owen's Marshmallow Chick thinking they would be similar. Not at all. They are very short, simple stories. Better for younger then 3 I guess. They will be good for when she starts to read I suppose."
4,Almost what I wanted.,"The brush is made exactly like the one I lost except for one thing: the smaller brush on top is not as hard as I would like.Except for that, it's perfect. I'm happy."
3,Made in Taiwan,"A little gold sticker on product says MADE IN TAIWAN. The bristles seem nice and soft against one's cuticles.Package says Distributed by Harry D. Koenig & Co, Inc., East Rockaway, New York."
2,Nail brush,This is a nice nail brush with a unique top nail brush. The bristles a soft and work well with longer nails.
2,Not helpful,"I think this could be helpful for toddlers and older in beds, but it wasn't useful for us. We have a toddler who still sleeps in a crib. And I skimmed through it pretty quickly and found most of the advice to be common sense. But I can see how common sense all in one place could be useful for some. But not us."
5,Sweet Dreams!,"I have read all three of the ""No Cry"" books for sleep and naps. Each book was helpful to us in different ways. When I was ready to ""night wean"" my toddler, I used the many age appropriate suggestions in this book (The No Cry Sleep Solution For Toddlers And Preschoolers). I found the ideas very easy to commit to, and my 1.5 year old did great with them too. There were times where she fussed in protest of our new routines, but she never cried or had hurt feelings. That was most important to me. Thanks to this book, we can both sleep peacefully!"
4,Some helpful ideas,"Book had some helpful ideas that I didn't see in other sleep books, such as the idea that taking a bath could stimulate rather than relax a toddler. Some of the tips in this book has helped us get our toddler to sleep better, when other books weren't really helping."
5,Love it!!!,"I've read a little bit more than half the book and put in practice a lot of the things I've read and it has worked like a charm until now. My LO used to wake up 5 times each night and now he wakes up 1 time and sometimes he doesn't wake up at all, and that's only half the book!!! I recommend it 100%, but it is important that ur partner reads it too or at least you give them the heads up on the changes that are going to happen and that he has to reinforce as well. Ur partners support is vital for this to work!"
4,Toddlers and sleep,"This was a gift to my daughter for my grandson. She found the book very helpful but the little one is only 14 months old and a lot of the material addressed older children. We thought the book for babies would not be helpful because of his age but we might have been wrong. Still, it's a very helpful book."
5,Great,"I thought the book was great. The author is very realalistic. She tells it like it is, and her suggestions are not tramatic to your child."
2,Made my problems worse!,"My son is post colicky so this book was not helpful at all to me. He showed no sleepy signs due to being chronically overtired. He cried MORE often and for longer durations after implementing most/all of the books suggestions and got up even more during the night! This book is best for those who nurse and co-sleep, and are willing to be up nights for months on end. It obviously worked for many, but not me! I found that it made all my son's problems worse which were only cleared up after implementing the steps from ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child."" My son is napping pretty regularly now after only a couple of weeks, and his disposition is markedly improving! He went from being up 2 or 3 times a night to sleeping 12 hours straight!!!!!!!! AND with LESS crying IF ANY! ""No-Cry"" is NO GOOD for me."
1,writing it down does not always help...,"This book was not helpful to me at all. The author suggests keeping ""waking logs"" and ""bedtime logs"", though she does not address how to resolve any problems. The only advice she gives is to have a consistent bedtime routine. If your toddler's sleep issues can be solved this easily, I doubt you would be buying this book in the first place..."
5,Finally! A loving solution to help my boys sleep,As parents of twins my wife and I are always on the look out for resources to help us provide the best upbringing for our sons. Sleep is perhaps the most challenging element we face. The No-Cry Sleep Solution for Toddlers and Preschoolers gave us a clear view of how sleep works which enabled us to support our sons as they learn to sleep well. Thank you!
5,Unbelieveable results!,"We had been having an awful time getting our boys (2 & 3 years old) to sleep at night. I was almost in tears every night it was so stressful. Everyone was telling us that we had to let them ""cry it out"", put a lock on their door or at least a gate. I felt there had to be another way but I was skeptical of a ""no cry"" solution. I read through some parts (I'll admit it, I was desperate for answers so I didn't read the whole thing) and came up with a plan. IT WORKED THE FIRST NIGHT!! Since then there have been nights where the boys have tested limits and have not gone to sleep right away but I'm not getting 1/2 as upset as I had been. We're on the right track and we all feel (and sleep) so much better. I love this book!"
5,"After 4 years, I FINALLY understand","How could I have parented for 4 years and never really understood the sleep of my child. She slept with me for the first several years and then I was stumped. I had another baby, a husband, and 2 cats plus my toddler and myself fighting for space in our king-sized bed. Why was she so wound up at 9pm? AHA! She should have been getting ready for bed at the first signs of tired- at SIX THIRTY! After reading this book, we have such a healthy sleep routine at our house. She knows what to expect and is never forced to cry. She sleeps in until the same time as when she was going to bed hours later. She needed those extra few hours. A must have for sleep-deprived parents!"
4,Worth Reading,"I thought this book was very helpful. We have really worked on our daughter's bedtime routine and that seems to have helped. Except for when her molars are coming in, she is sleeping all night. It has some great sections on sleeping through the night, moving to a big kid bed, and needing parents there to fall asleep."
2,Two Stars,"A word to anyone considering this book: If your problem is weaning your pre-schooler from the breast or family bed, then this is your book. That was most definitely not my problem, so this offered no solution for me unless I was looking to spend upwards of an hour and a half on a bed-time routine. That is not what I am striving for in a bedtime ritual!"
2,okay,"I don't think it was really that different from her book pertaining to infants. Honestly, I didn't learn anything new. I already knew about having a consistent schedule and bedtime routine. However, it did make me feel better to realize I'm not the only one still struggling. My daughter is 2.5 years old and I'm still up 3-4 times a night with her. Not having sleep for this long is draining after a while. I'm still searching for that perfect solution...Great book for someone that hasn't looked into helping their child sleep before...but after this long I can't imagine that is the case. It did remind me of a few things such as the signs of a little one needing to take a nap."
2,"All talk, no meat","I got this book to help me get some ideas on what to do with my toddler who has sleep issues. I read this book and spent the entire time saying ""yes, yes, yes, that is us!"" She had it so right describing our situation. I do admit I then felt like I was not alone and could deal with this. However, when I finished the book and I had no more idea of what to do than when I started the book. Less repetition of the problem, more solutions is what I needed that I did not get from this book. I'm sad I spent my money on it."
1,They want HOW MUCH!?!?!?!?!,"Don't even come close to paying more than $5.00 for these Disney Toys Pixar characters. I can't believe Amazon allows this kind of price gouging on their website. I have bought over 30 of these cars for my son, NEVER paying more than $5.00-6.00 each, most having been bought for $2.99-3.99 at KB Toys, Target and Toys-R-Us.I hope you price gougers read this and are ashamed of yourselves."
1,Way too expensive,"Good God, man, why on earth would anyone pay this kind of money for a toy car? Get it at Target or Walmart for $3.95. What a ripoff. I can't believe Amazon allows its sellers to charge this kind of money. I love The King as much as the next person, and my son is crazy ga-ga for all things Cars, but if we can't find a particular character at Target then he learns a lesson in delayed gratification. Don't waste your money buying it on Amazon."
3,Well Written. Unconvincing.,"Stylistically, this book has much to recommend it. Written as it is in a lyrical, flowing prose that evokes the doom that surrounded the sisters, it engages and elevates what might have been a bone-dry, clinical analysis to a more poetic ""tragedy"".Having said that, I also found it to be an occassionally ponderous, embarassingly pretentious effort to discern shapes in the darkness. In this case (despite the complaints of some who criticize it on narrative grounds...e.g., the author ruined the ending), the journey is the destination. The confessional purge of its narration is the exercise of real significance. And Eugenides writes with the nimble elegance that's needed to pull it off. Trouble is, having been a teenage boy myself, I bought not one ounce of its melodious prose, reeking as it did of rapturous ""New Yorker"" musings."
3,One sentence after another....,"No climax, no denouement, no conclusion. Just sentence after sentence. I listened to the audio cd's to kill the boredom of my commute, but this is not one of those books I stayed in the car at lunch listening to. Original, but, well, yawn."
4,Beautiful,Loved this one as much as his other ones beautifully written sensitive topic i highly reccomend this work of art
2,Not Everything I Had Hoped It Would Be,"I read to the end, but it was a struggle. I really enjoyed Eugenides' Middlesex, when I read it with my book group several years ago. I tried to read his latest novel, The Marriage Plot, this month, but found it impossible to follow or get close to the characters or plot underneath all the obscure literary reference and detail. The Virgin Suicides, his first novel, is completely different, in all aspects, indicating his skill and dexterity as a writer. Still, there is such a sense of remove from the characters, it is difficult, if not impossible, to connect with them or get fully-engaged in the story. While the events of the story, and the tragedy, is compelling, it is empty and emotionless in the way it is told from an outsider's perspective, so far removed."
2,POORLY WRITTEN,"Miserably failing the 40 page rule, it's simply not possible to become engaged with anyone in this poorly written drawn out 'story'. The writer is going for some of the vibe in Salinger's family stories but while those are very hit and miss, this fails utterly. Where is the editor? Everyone in this book is very smug, very self-satisfied, very self-absorbed and honestly it's very difficult to make a story set in the suburbs engaging. But it's a little unnerving that a 'grown-up' wrote this. There's a pervy aspect to this whole thing."
4,The Blacker Side of Americana,"I love Jeffrey Eugenides' prose. It is both emotive and lyrical and will involve you emotionally every step of the way.This story, about the collapse of a family following the suicide of first the one, and then the remaining four daughters while the neighbourhood boys dream about saving the girls, but essentially just stand by and watch, has a hefty dose of teen angst with sprinklings of wry, black humour strewn throughout was a fascinating read, but it does leave a melancholy feeling and a funny aftertaste behind."
3,But why?,"Yes, it's a good read; yes, you can read it in one sitting; yes, the details about life as an adolescent are fascinating but ... somehow this book just didn't hang well together (pun intended) for me. I really didn't feel much for the girls, so when the book ended, I thought: who cares? The boy who narrates never really gets inside the girls' minds, we never really know what went on in their rotting house or what lead to their tragic ends. It was as if we as readers were also watching from across the street, never getting any closer or deeper, and I found that frustrating."
5,Potent and Provocative,"An odd recollection of absurd events in an unnamed suburbia by an anonymous generation of boys, this novel keeps you entranced in paradoxes while never promising solutions. Generation-gap conflict is most certainly present, but not force-fed by any means. Social commentary runs high but, thankfully, lacks preachy explanation, satisfying the reader only by provoking him or her to ponder further alone. Surely, this work will both baffle and bewitch you, but don't expect a happy ending. The plot is disturbing, though surely not gratuitously graphic or lewd. The language is graceful and perfect, in accordance with the pretend perfection of America, where everyone ""pretends to be happy."" Devour this book and allow yourself time to digest it. Don't be scared of the jarring title--this novel is a real thinker."
4,Like a prayer,"""The Virgin Suicides"" is a poetic and lyrical novel. With the Catholic sensibility, it reads like an epic poem or a prayer. It's also funny, in the sense of being humorous, but also funny in the sense of being peculiar. The central characters are the Lisbon girls, overprotected by their strict parents. But this novel is not just for women. The narrator is a grown man looking back on his teenage years. Any male who grew up in the 70's, in the suburbs, and went to Catholic school (this reader is guilty on all charges) will immediately recognize and identify with his point of view. It's wistful, combining both longing and irony. Moreover, he's mystified by the sexuality of the Lisbon girls, who remain distant (not only to him but the reader). While the title gives away the climax of the book, it doesn't matter. The deaths of the girls are allegorical, and like much else in this fine book, are not unlike an event in a magic realist novel."
2,Don't bother with this one -- read Middlesex instead.,"If you haven't read anything by Jeffrey Eugenides, skip the Virgin Suicides and head right to Middlesex. VS was slow paced and dull. The characters were merely charicatures -- shallow and unrelatable. By the end, I couldn't wait until all the girls were dead -- just to put this painfully boring story out of its misery.Thank goodness I read Middlesex by Eugenides before I read this one. Middlesex was a very interesting story -- one of my recent favorites. If I had read VS first, I wouldn't have even bothered with Middlesex.My recommendation -- skip The Virgin Suicides and head right to Middlesex. VS should be put to rest. It's going right into my Goodwill box -- not even worthy of passing to one of my many book-loving friends."
2,Disappointing,Hugely disappointing. I expected more for the book. It was boring and not what I expected.
2,Please find something else,"The Virgin Suicides is a story of five daughters living under the strict and strange religious rule of their dominant mother. As the girls begin to experience teenage freedoms, the unbelievable suburban nightmare begins. The story is told from the perspective of neighbor boys who, along with their parents and the girls own father, watch in impotence. Did anyone ever hear of social services? Pick up a different book, this one is just not worth it."
3,interesting but simple at times,this book was alright. The premise was a bit simple but Eugenide's ability to describe people emotions and settings are apparent through this novel. The Narration in this book at times was a bit hard to follow and i found that I really enjoyed his book Middlesex so much better. There was much more of a story in that book. As a masters student of psychology and employed in the psych field i thought his insight into suicide and mental illness was lacking but did show how people form their own opinions and form such interest in things unknown. a great sociological teaching tool for reactions to deviant behaviors.
2,uninteresting,"I do not understand why others gave this book such a high rating. I thought this book was very dull with exception to the way in which the boys discovered that the girls were dead. I forced myself to finish the book, because I thought that there had to be something good in it, because of it's high rating. I can not recomend this book."
2,"Not the ""Middlesex"" that I was looking for","I read this book because I had loved Middlesex and wanted something along the same vein. I was really disappointed, and sadly, now on page 172, I give up. I don't often give up on my books, but I decided that if the only reason I was finishing this was to say that I had finished it, it wasn't worth the effort. I agree with the other reviewer that said that she had no connection with the characters or their movitives for suicide (or researching the suicide, in the case of the boys). I came to Amazon to see if the ending made the rest of the read worth it, and most people have suggested that there are no answers. Alas, I'll move on to other things."
1,Don't read it just because you liked Middlesex!,"Having just finished and loved the book Middlesex, by the same author, I ordered and quickly started reading this one. Thank goodness it was a much shorter book. Unlike Middlesex, it was vague in both plot and character development. It was difficult to finish, and I was surprised to hear it was sucessful enough to be made into a movie. But then the reviews of the movie don't appear to be very positive either. Just a warning...these two books don't have much in common...read Middlesex instead, it's great and was justly honored by the Pulitzer Prize!"
4,Eugenides is a master,"This is beautifully written, if not as polished as Middlesex, which he wrote years later. I was engrossed."
2,Great potential,"I was intrigued by the idea of this book, yet when I got to actually read it, I was disappointed. Eugenides has a charming style of writing but it wasn't enough to pull this story out. In fact, the story itself wasn't so bad but I feel it would've been much more effective if it'd been told from another point of view. The story lacked alot of forward motion and never really answered any of the central questions to the plot. I felt that the characters were left terribly shady and I couldn't care for them as much as I'd hoped."
3,This book gave ME suicidal tendencies....,"Although this story is moving and well written; the initial chapter in the novel gave too much away, too soon. I felt that since I knew of the impending doom that was to befall the main characters, there was no need for further reading. The tone is set as an obsessive investigation into the lives of the 5 Lisbon Sisters. The premise is interesting and unique. But, it's also disturbing. The investigating is being done by several neighborhood boys who apparently have nothing better to do other than snoop around the Lisbons' house, collecting memorabilia and ideas of what goes on in the girls' minds. The boys are extremely obsessed with the beauty and mystery behind the five sisters to a degree that is a little disconcerting.I'm interested to see the movie and how it will deal with the delicate traumas that unfold, but I would not recommend this book to my friends."
4,"Brilliant, mysterious, and melancholy","Jeffrey Eugenides, in his novel ""The Virgin Suicides,"" creates a portrait of the title characters--the Lisbon sisters who take their lives--so haunting, the reader is left thinking of them and their plight days after the last page is read. Through skillful narration, he lets his audience see them through a haze, through the eyes of boys across the street. In the book, the boys have grown into men, but are still mesmerized by the girls and their sad end. By novel's end, the reader doesn't really know the Lisbons nor their male admirers . . . but wants to."
2,A waste of my time.,"After the hype over the movie, I did what I usually do, I read the book before considering seeing the movie. It was a waste of eyesight in my opinion. Too much needless detail and not enough story will kill my interest in a book pretty quickly. I kept on reading hoping I would ""get it"". Still can't even figure out a point to this book and do not understand all the rave reviews."
4,Surprisingly interesting,"I was assigned to read this novel in my liturature class. I was very surprised at the rate at which I read this novel. Normally I don't even finish the books assigned. I saw Eugenides using the Lisbon sisters as a parallel to the rest of modern day society. The events at school, the seclusion, ect... This was not the best book I have ever read, but it is definately worth making a trip to the library for."
5,Liquid Poetry,"This book was excellent. If you liked the movie, read the book and you'll understand so much more. The author describes the scenes to every last detail in this depressing but real novel. Teenage obsession and how far it will go."
5,"A rare,disturbing,marvelous,depressing masterpiece","This book tells the sad tale of the five Lisbon sisters,who are fated to kill themselves through the course of a year. It explores the relationships between parents and children and boys and girls. After the death of Cecilia, the remaining sisters are slowly suffocated out of existence by their mother and their only hope for salvation is the neighborhood boys. The all too human truths and emotions that run rampant throughout this novel are what make it as genuine as a news article; they are what make this novel the darkly shimmering tale of a family's descent into a dark unending abyss of misery."
4,A Haunting and Sad Tale,"First, I must commend Jeffrey Eugenides for the way he uses a chorus of young boys to narrate the novel. We never know who exactly the ""I"" of the story is, if indeed there is an ""I."" But we see not only the pain of five girls subjected to an extremely strict mother, but the pain of the boys whose adolescence -- whose entire view of women -- are forever marked by the fate of the Lisbon girls. Just don't read this book if you are seriously depressed!"
2,What is the point?,"I read this for my monthly book club and while it made for great discussion, most of us just wondered why? Why would the author choose to write in this style of narrative and *spoiler alert* write from the perspective of balding middle aged men obsessed with 5 girls they barely knew? It was just so drawn out and pointless. We thought a much better twist would have been the parents on trial for neglect... or to find out someone was responsible, but maybe that is just because I love a good murder mystery. I'm just not sure what all the hype is about here although I will say that I haven't watched the movie & those that had had stronger reactions to the book."
2,Depressing!!!,"While I love the author's command of the English language, I thought the plot was pointless and depressing. His vocabulary is astonishing but the content was disapointing."
4,Haunting,"The story of five sisters who all commit suicide ion one year seems like it would be a big downer, but it's not, and in fact is very funny in places.One of the most interesting things to me about this novel was how little we actually know, if anything, about the narrator. Instead he serves his purpose almost as a Greek chorus, presenting the facts and being close enough to the epicenter of the storm to folow the tragic events closely.I read almost the whole book in one sitting, and it has lingered with me long after I've finished it. I enjoyed ""Middlesex"" more than this, however this is a haunting and well written first novel that at times is as funny as it is sad.."
4,Good Work,"Well-written and haunting, the beauty lies in the narration. I found myself never getting quite close enough or intimate with the subjects of the story, never truly becoming a part of their world - but that's the point. One feels like an outsider peering in. It's a sad tale, from the first sentence, but oddly enjoyable."
5,"Otherworldly, Fascinating, Darkly Enlightening","Described as well as I can by the words above, this book is eerie, amazing, and beautiful. You know you have a good author when the questions and plot don't even get answered or wind up, and you're still completely satisfied when you've turned the last page. Buy this book. PLEASE. You can't go wrong."
2,Not exactly literature,"I had to read this book for a college class and I couldn't believe the professor would assign such trash. The book made Catholics look bad, trivialized female emotions, and was just too depressing. Literature worthy of study? I think not. This read like a bad Lifetime movie. Wait, that's not exactly right--Lifetime movies are sometimes entertaining."
3,A mixed bag,"Here is what is innovative and cool about this novel:1) A subject matter that is really pretty interesting (and rather creative).2) A cool setting (yay - 70's suburbia).3) An exciting form of narration (a collective second person, used more often in a few really good short stories than in novels like this, but still, pretty fun, and well executed)/ Here is what is slightly less cool:1) Characters who you sort of care about, but not really.2) A lot of unanswered questions (which would sort of be the point of this book to answer).3) The raising of issues which are commonly raised in literature.It is a fun read - and better than the movie. Still. Nothing brilliant. I read it on an airplane, which may account for my lack of enjoyment, but it was first class, so I doubt it."
2,Bored in Bethesda,"I must be too old for this book. I agree with the readers who found the plot flimsy, shallow, and unsatisfying, with characters like paper dolls (especially the five sisters). The suicides never rise above a plot gimmick, allowing the teenage boys to romanticize the girls, who we never get to know. We read this for our book group and I considered reading it to be a waste of time."
3,Slow story doesn't really go anywhere,"Like many, I purchased this novel after having read the author's magnificent book, Middlesex. I had also seen the movie, starring Kirsten Dunst, which I recall enjoying quite a bit. Whether in comparison with Middlesex, or the film version, I found the novel lacking.Perhaps being familiar with the story resulted in a lack of suspense, though there can't really be much suspense when the author reveals the ultimate end game early in the novel. The writing was quite good, though I felt that the story dragged significantly for a good majority of the book.Bottom line, there's really not much story there. The flowery and descriptive prose can only cover for a slow moving plot for only so long before it quite simply becomes boring. I reached that point at about page 100."
2,Disappointing,"I read ""Middlesex"" first and was disappointed by the ""Virgin Suicides"". I did not find the sisters as engaging as I had hoped and struggled to get through this. I wouldn't spend the time on this one."
3,Ugh! and somehow fascinating,"I don't know how Eugenides picks the subjects for his novels, but he is somehow able to make them palatable and even enjoyable. He is able to get into the heads of teenage girls and boys and make their choices understandable."
3,..,"The storyline is good, but I just felt it could have been put out better. I didn't like the eerie feel throughout the novel. After I read the novel, I watched the movie, but the novel was better.. However, I feel that the movie portrayed the eerie feeling perfectly. Although the story of five beautiful sisters committing suicide is very interesting, the way Eugenides made it was rather dull. Sorry to sound so negative.. I'm just saying that its a good read, but not the best of books."
4,A bit of a stretch...,"I have only cried while reading twice in my life - during ""A Summer to Die"" and during this book. ""The Virgin Suicides"" is extremely frustrating and depressing to read because the reader can't help but want to reach out and help these girls. I did think the way it's portrayed (from the perspective of all the neighborhood boys) was a bit of a stretch and detracted from the overall story, but it's still a great book.Definitely worth reading!"
3,I guess...,"This was an interesting book. It had a good plot and the author described everything so perfectly and precisly. There are a few things that I wondered about the book: In a way it left the reader hanging. I wish that the author would have gone into more detail about the Lisbon girls, so we could figure out a little more about what was going through thier heads. I wished that maybe I could've gotten to know the girls a little better, just so I could relate to them, which might make the story a little more realistic. Maybe it was the authors intent to allow you to let you create your own thoughts about the girls - I don't know. For the most part though, it was a pretty good book. The author is VERY descriptive which I like, and so, I do reccommend it to anyone who enjoys these kind of deep, heart wrenching books..."
3,Worthwhile Read,"The Virgin Suicides provided a heartfelt look deep into the obsession with the 5 teenage girls, the Lisbon sisters. The book however, goes so much deeper than that. It looks at love, loneliness, obsession, lust, guilt, family and so much more. The book started off as a real page turner, however by about the mid way point is slowed down a bit and that chapters seemed to never end. Still it is a worthwhile read."
1,Hated it.,"This is a very well-written book, with beautiful imagery. I found it almost poetic; that said, however, that is all it seemed to be. A well-written book about absolutely nothing. I felt nothing for the characters, could never find any of their motivations, and in the end, just got nothing from reading it."
5,Love the movie! Love the book!,"Since I watched the Sophia Coppola movie version before reading the actual book, I had to get a taste of the literal words to compare to the character's voices on the big screen.I love the fact that, unlike the movie, in the book THE VIRGIN SUICIDES Eugenides describes places that are familiar to me as a Detroiter. Reading this made me feel more at home than the movie version. The descriptions remind me also of Kane's book, CONFESSIONS OF A CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRLConfessions of a Catholic Schoolgirlas it goes to places that no other ""black comedy"" would dare to go. I guess I understand the whole, misunderstood, deeply distressed schoolgirl thing."
5,Charming,"It was exactly what I've been looking for: compelling and charming, I definitely liked this book.I would recommend it to anyone who is searching a book that can entertain and interest the reader, hurling them right into the story keeping their attention alive."
4,The virgin suicides,"This is an great book i couldent put it down. The storyline is amazing. It was written in a way that almost anyone could connect to one of the chacters. What the five Lisbon girls go through throughout the book is told so well that you can almost feal their pain. It's a book everyone should have read atleast once, and when your finished with the book rent the movie ;0)"
3,This book was not as I expected.,"""The Virgin Sucides"" was compelling, yet boring. When the book discuissed what was going on it would occasionally slip off somewhere else that really didn't have anything to do with the point he was trying to make. I feel if Jeffry Eugenides had stayed on track with his story it would be better"
3,A very smelly book,"I thought this was a beautifully written book, but the author concentrated so much on different foul odors that it took away some of the beauty of it for me. I could not read it without thinking of bad bodily smells, or the smells coming from the Lisbon house. The book made me think about why these girls commited suicide and I like the fact that the author never really tells you why so you can come to your own conclusions. My only other criticism was that I never really connected with the sisters, except for Lux, who seemed the be the focal point of the story. I am interested in seeing what the movie will be like."
1,not a good read.,"the title caught me, as did what the back of the book said. however, the book itself didn't really speak to me. it spoke at me, which was very annoying. there was too much psychological talk, and it all seemed like a memory. the author didn't do a great job at switching from past to present. another thing that bothered me, was the fact that the plot buildup was weak. it just basically talks about cecilia's death the whole time, and then skips immiediatly to the ending. the ending itself did not offer much closure to the novel. some may like it, however it didn't really hit home with me."
1,can you spell B-O-R-I-N-G?!!!,"After reading several reviews about this book, I decided to purchase it. I have never experienced anything so boring in my life. The endless pages of descriptions, and paragraphs that lasted just as long made me want to throw this book across the room. Although I found the storyline interesting, I could not get past the author's boring style."
2,Boring,"I just finished reading Middlesex and rushed out and bought the Virgin Suicides. I am very glad I bought this book at an outlet for 70% off. This book did not even compare to Middlesex. Hopefully, the next time Jeffrey Eugenides writes a book it will be more like Middlesex, and less like the Virgin Suicides."
2,"Read ""Middlesex"" Instead","Maybe it's because I read ""Middlesex"" first and got my expectations up... I couldn't even finish this book, but obviously there are many who disagree. Read ""Middlesex"" and see how much improved his second novel was!"
2,**,"The success of and reverence for this novel mystifies me. I thought it was half-baked, with no great psychological insight or originality, frankly, and, despite a lot of prententious writing (or perhaps because of it) found the narrator(s) to be, underneath all the ""thinking,"" surprisingly unreflective. The boys seemed detached and cold. And a few incidents were strung over many pages. Also the ""symbolism,"" the pagan metaphors and Catholic references, seemed contrived and geared to make the text seem ""literary"" rather than add genuine heft and depth to the story. Such things should be organic, and not placed in a narrative merely for the sake of giving it literary cachet."
2,lame lame lame,"i found this book to be a lot of words in search of a plot. after the first suicide, it bogs down and while it could be exploring the sisters, bringing us to understand them, the reader is left looking in the windows at strangers like the young men across the street. we are never given a clue to the parents' obsessive overprotectiveness or how they are able to get such co-operation from 4 teenage girls in what is virtual imprisonment. i suppose that is the ""mystery"" and allure of the book for some, but i found it a waste of time. the most interesting character is the sister who kills herself in chapter 1."
3,Just not my kind of book.,"I decided to get this book after seeing so many good reviews but upon reading it I was kind of let down. I can understand why some people would like this book, but I don't. To me the whole thing has just seemed painfully slow. I don't like the writing style, too many metaphors and drawn out descriptions. It's like this author thought they had to write everything to sound like poetry and it's too much. Bleh! Again, somebody else would probably like this, I just don't."
2,good start - weak finish,"The first half of this book was a great read with an original premise and interesting writing. However, halfway through it became very tedious and slow moving. There is no story build up to the end and the reader really doesn't find out any more about the characters than we knew in the beginning. I was hoping for more and it made it even more disappointing because the beginning and writing were both very good."
2,Did not live up to the hype,"I read this book for my book club and found it to be enormously over-rated. The characters were seriously underdeveloped and as a result, it was extremely difficult to invest in the flimsy plot. Although the writing style was interesting, the author wouldn't know subtlety if it hit him in the head. Eugenides had a great idea, but the development was poor and I was left feeling like little more than a rubber-necker at an accident scene with no real conception of why I had bothered looking."
2,An Overwritten Mess,"I was seduced by the overall great reviews, and my huge admiration for ""Middlesex"". This was not in the same realm.The writing was beautiful, but there was entirely too much of it. It got to the point where I just felt like reading the ending to see how it all played out. There were so many unnecessary descriptions and events that they ceased to be relevant. After the first few chapters, the rest of the novel just left me with a profound disappointment that I would have to listen to these same voices over and over without truly finding out what made the characters tick. I'd skip this one."
5,"Darkly comic, sardonic, but heartfelt drama","This book is darkly comic and disturbing. However, Eugenides skillfully interplays the darkest moments with light comic farce to keep the story from dipping too deep into a macabre well. Each character, from the narrators to the teens themselves, are masterfully, and ultimately, emotionally characterized. I love the dark side; but let's face it, if the book doesn't provide revelation but merely provokes, it isn't a worthy read. ""The Virigin Suicides"" does provoke, shock and prod the reader, but in a way that sheds light on the universal pain and sadness shared by adolescents and of course, the child in all adults."
4,The Virgin Suicides,"I found this book to be quite unexpected. Call me slow, but it all came into focus when I realized it was a love story. I thought it was brilliantly written even though the subject is a little taboo! I couldn't put it down at all. Eugenides did an excellent job of capturing a long year in the eyes of suburban teenagers!"
4,Don't judge this book by it's cover!,"Yes, the name of this book tells you a great deal about the storyline. What the title doesn't tell you is why everyone should read this book! I read this book in a single day...I literally could not put it down. The way Eugenides weaves pain with beauty is breathtakingly haunting. Buy this book for it's title, and love it for the characters who will find a way into your heart!"
4,Sometimes there aren't answers,"I'll agree with the previous reviewer that this books gives a lot of questions without answers, but I found that to be one of it's strengths. It made the book more realistic, we were struggling for the same understanding that was haunting the boys years after the suicides.It's amazing how the author seemed to understand girls without really understanding them. You can see the girls are struggling, but at times it seems like they don't even know themselves why they are struggling. Again, I found that to be realistic. Maybe it's hormones.It's not an uplifting book by any means, but I think it puts you in the place of troubled teens in a very emotional way. And emotions are often void of reason."
3,The Virgin Suicides: A Novel,"This item was listed as free shipping, and ordered on September 2nd. I find out that it won't be shipped until September 20th...I won't order free shipping again and will probably look elsewhere to buy. This is rediculous!"
2,other reviews seemed a bias responce to the movie,"If you really are interested watch the movie don't read the book. Lyrical? yes. Easy read? yes. if you have lots of time to just sit and read i would say read it but if your not so blessed with time don't. It is a Ophra book type book that is easy pleasure read, but not even given the depressing tone of the work.The situation itself is not a very viable i would say in this day and age. Of parents of girls being ridiculously overprotective of their children and driving them to suicide, although that is not the only factor which caused the girls demise. Also the guys fasicination at the girls seems to be highly unrealistic. As a nonsensical work it can be enjoyable but to gain any real application no.The other reviews seem to have been biasly written, mostly i would guess by the fans of the movie and such. not highly recommended. make your own decision."
1,Disappointing and Dull,"Kind of looking back and trying to determine why I chose this book in the first place. I think it was because of the generally positive reviews of this and Middlesex. I read this one first because it was shorter and to get a feel for the author.For me, the title of the book suggested a much more interesting story than what was delivered here. Maybe it was just how removed the story seemed from me, the reader. This story was basically told by a narrator who was a distant spectator to most of the action (giving his best guess as to what happens in many cases) and all the action is being recalled from some 20 or so years ago.Dialog is minimal in this book as is action. The humor missed me entirely as did the appeal of this book. Others seemed to have enjoyed this, though I'm not sure how.No chance of me reading Middlesex after trudging through this one."
2,Dissapointing,"I'm always amazed at the praise this books receives. I read this as a teenager and I couldn't even identify with any of the characters then. I tried watching the movie and it was even worse! The premise has more shock than substance, but there's really no story here."
2,poetic but falls short as a novel,"Jeffrey Eugenides' ""Middlesex"" is one of my favorite novels, and so my expectations were high for The Virgin Suicides. I wonder if that's why I was so disappointed in this tale of the suicides of a whole family of adolescent girls. I listened to the audio-book, and the reader was quite good, but I never was engaged by the story or characters. The writing was beautiful. It really was mysterious and poetic, but that was not enough to sustain me for a whole novel. While I enjoyed bits and pieces very much, this story just never grabbed a hold of me. About a third of the way through, I decided that I didn't care enough to continue. Maybe it picked up later, but I'll never know."
3,"Well written, but .....","I saw the movie before reading the book, so maybe that was a mistake. I was really looking for more insight to the story, as I usually find when reading the book after viewing the movie. That wasn't the case here. The movie covered the book exactly, nothing extra in the book at all. The writing was well done and very descriptive, but I found the book to be extremely slow-paced. It was depressing, of course, but I figured it would be. I just really had hoped for some more insight into the girls' minds. They covered so much more about Lux that I felt I didn't know who the other girls were at all. Definitely worth reading, but it wasn't everything I had hoped it would be. As a side note, I would give director Sofia Coppola 5 stars for her movie version, as she did a great job bringing this book to the big screen."
4,"Great Book, Good Message","The Virgin Suicides was a marvelous book. I think that it started off slow but then developed into a really great story. The author seemed to talk about how the boys in the neighborhood were obsessed with the girls and did all they could to get to know them better, but it turned out in the end that no matter how much pointless knowledge that they knew about them, they really never knew the girls at all. I would highly recommend this book for teenage boys because it may assist in teaching them not to just look skin deep. It could help show them that instead of just gawking at a girl you should actually try to get to know her for who she is. I would also recommend this book for girls. I think that it would be good for them because some could possible identify with the Lisbon girls, understand some of the things that they are going through, and recognize that they aren't alone and most girls probably are going through the same things."
4,"Fun, poppy club song","This song's distinctive, infectious beat made it a huge hit worldwide. This song is a great follow up to her first hit, ""Goodies"" featuring Petey Pablo. The lyrics aren't especially clever or thought provoking: ""Rock it, don't Stop it, everybody get on the floor, crank the party up we about to get it on, let me see you 1,2 step..."" but that's ok because it's a song to dance, not philosophize to! Jazze Pha's introduction and Missy Elliot's verse at the end blend in nicely. By the way, it's funny that so many people here are calling Ciara a one hit wonder. She's had three hit singles so far and is featured on Missy Elliot's latest hit, ""Lose Control."" I think she definitely has a future in the fickle music industry, partly because she's Missy's protégé and she works with tons of huge names such as Dr. Dre and Ludacris."
1,More garbage,"This music is dying and being shown for what it really is: lip sync, no talent trash......thank GOD!"
2,it's ok,"these songs are decent at the club,but Ciara's vocals are really lightweight&the Grooves are all the same. it's cool to be at the Club dancing to them,but after a while He limited vocal range comes rather quickly than later."
2,"Well, at least it's better than Goodies... (2.5 Stars)","Ciara's second single, ""1, 2 Step"" is a few steps (at least) above that off-key attrocity ""Goodies"" because of a few things:-no Petey Pablo, yes Missy Elliot-no Lil Jon, yes Jazze PhaThat's right. Jazze Pha provides a pretty decent backdrop for Ciara's surprisingly ON-key singing and Missy Elliot spits, uh, 4 bars, in her extremely brief verse. I guess 1, 2 Step is an alright joint for the clubs, but can Ciara pull off a single on her own? Her next one features Ludacris, so we'll have to wait and see if Ciara can hold her own as an artist."
4,"It's time to start 1,2 steppin'","I don't care too much about Crunk & B or whatever you want to call it because it's not gonna last anyway. But this song is the jam! It actually makes you want to throw it down on the dance floor. I have it on my MP3 player and I listen to it while I jog. Missy's rap piece in the song isn't really anything spectacular. All she did was copy someone else's flow style. Hey, Missy! Who's biting someone else's style now?"
1,Music Has Ended,Music ended when Ciara got a record deal. She was told to whisper into a microphone when reciting lyrics penned by a third-grader. Sounds like talent to me.
2,Get the other Vader koto,"It's a good depiction of Vader, however kotos are mass products and mine came with a defective bump on the torso and the arm couldn't be attached. Also the base is with some desperfection, but without a base it sustains. Not the best Koto around."
1,Garbage,There is a reason these are so cheap... They do not wick. With the originals I was going through 3 gallons a day. Bought these and the water seemed to never run out. These do not work.
4,Good price on working product.,"Its a filter, just like the original but cut alittle big, like 1/8"". No troubles, push it in, they are soft and then you know you have a good seal."
3,Generic AC-819 Wick Filter,"I have used generic wick filters over the years and up to this point all have had a heavy foil matrix in the center of the filter for added strength. These do not have that feature. The filters appear to be the correct height but are a little too long to fit easily in the holder. I trimmed the edge on the first one and now it is a tad loose so I will try cramming the entire filter into the holder when I replace the first one. The first one has only been in service for a couple of weeks but seems to be holding up so far. On the plus side, these filters were less expensive than the ones that I have used in the past so at this point, I would call it a push."
1,Duracraft Wick,I purchased this item thinking it was the real duracraft inline filter. What I received was a privite label (BULK) filter UFD19C Which by the way only lasted for 17 days. Very poor quality. I have purchased duracraft filters in the past and have had great results with their performance.
4,Worth your money,"This mostly feels like the undercard to a UFC event, but this is not too far off from the big leagues. 5 double sided dvd's give you 10 events with about 125 matches of various calibre. You will spot a few faces you might recognize and many more you will not. Some great fights, some terrible and a lot in between. For the money you can't go wrong. Though for some of the bigger and better names in the KOTC, they put out single event dvd's which are reasonably priced compared to the UFC/Pride counterparts. This is the 3rd box set for KOTC. A box set best of is being released in July."
2,Poor man's UFC,"Mostly third-rate matches with some guys quitting after the first round because they are out of breath. Now and then, a good match is thrown in, like the one between Dean Lister and Jeremy Irons, but it is marred by incompetent ringside reporting. Visual quality is only fair.I'd much rather watch a UFC or Pride disc-10 bouts of highly skilled fighters, shot with quality camerawork and reporting instead of 135 fights between mediocre fighters, with mediocre camerawork and reporting."
4,"Good, but only for specialists","I bought this book to get some idea how to disguise my weapons better and how others might be disguising theirs. This book did not help me at all. It is a good book, but it is targeted at US America. There are a lot of weapons covered that are only thinkable under the liberal laws of the USA.If you are a non US citizen you will find a lot of facts where you will think 'What a crazy country that this stuff can be legally purchased'. But it will not help you with questions like: What kind of my self-defense weapon can I hide how ?It was interesting to read, but I felt, I should have spend my money on another book, because I am not living in the US."
5,A 'must read' for everyone in law enforcement,"Author Craig S. Meissner draws upon his many years as a New York City police officer in ""Disguised Weapons: The Law Enforcement Guide To Covert Guns, Knives, And Other Weapons"", a profusely illustrated compendium on the diverse kinds of covert weaponry found on people in the street, prisoners in custody, and favored by those with nefarious intent. There are guns disguised as beepers and cell phones, plastic knives shaped like credit cards, stun guns in the form of pens and flashlights, even blowgun flutes and condom garrotes. Informed and informative, ""Disguised Weapons"" is a unique compendium of lethal covert weaponry that should be considered a 'must read' for everyone in law enforcement from the cop on the beat, to the private security guard, to the border patrol agent, to airport security personnel, to members of the armed forces in hostile territories, to defense-minded civilians."
1,Swiss Made -- Like Cheese,"Buyer beware. My experience with this product was quite frustrating. The first one arrived in working order, but within a day I noticed a small cloud in the crystal, which by day two completely obscured the dial. Amazon's customer service was excellent, and within the week my return shipping was covered, and a replacement sent. However, the second watch did not function at all -- it could have been the battery, but I wasn't able to set the date either. I sent it back and now I have a Seiko I really love.There were positives: Nice weight and finish, and the band was easily adjustable without involving a jeweler. But then again, none of that matters if you can't tell what time it is does it?"
3,Expected quality,"I purchased both a Boy's and a Girl's version of this bike at the same time. They are of expected quality. The Girl's version required me to disassemble the cranks as the chain ring was rubbing on the the chainstay. I'm not sure if the production tolerances were the cause of it or not, but it definitely should have been caught had there been any quality control inspection. I was able to insert a washer to provide proper sufficient spacing, but it was still close. The Boy's version had at least a 1/4"" spacing."
4,Led to some good discussions,"I have used this book with children in social skills groups to teach them how being mean to other kids can hurt them. Even though the kids found some of the book funny, and loved the illustrations, they didn't entirely understand the point at first. The book is rather complex, and most young children won't get the underlying message without some adult coaching to help them understand it. I do believe the book is worth it, though, because what the author is trying to teach is so important."
2,Warning: nightmares,"Definitely not a story for younger ones. Over-promoted &/or marketed. We viewed the 'Bunch of Munsch' DVD which included this story & it gave my 5 year old nightmares, & left my 4 yr old unhappy. Both were confused. Only one of the stories was really appreciated by the kids. A friend who watched with us summed it up: ""Weird. Why?"" In summary, Beware: some Munsch are better than others, skip the 'Bunch.'"
3,A rather strange ending...,"I found this series to be absolutely riveting for the first 3 novels, entertaining but less enjoyable in the next 2, and then the last 3 just got bizarre.Glen Cook's writing style changed each time different character took over as Annalist. Clearly, imo, Croaker could tell a tale. Once they started this ""ghosting"" thing, the novels were no longer as interesting. That mechanism just didn't thrill me.Also, seeing Goblin and One-Eye reduced to what they became was hard to watch. And, Silent was sorely missed in all the books of the south.There are times I wish I never read past the first 3 books, because those were excellent."
3,Cook Got Bored,"I've loved the series since book one, but the last three seem to belong to a different series. This book seems to exist primarily to finish the series and answer the questions. Not much actually happens and the ending is just rather odd. All th e old characters are gone and I, for one, rather miss them. On the whole, I'd suggest reading this for the answers but don't expect too much."
5,Great book!,"Great book! It fits well with the rest of the series, much better than the books of Murgen, though, in my opinion."
4,"Nicely developed, but two questions remain ...","I've always wondered what the stellae were and why Lady didn't distribute Soul Catcher's name (or why Murgen didn't travel in time to the place Lady and Croaker used the arrows with her name on them) ... Those questions still aren't answered.Everything else is. Better, the set up for the next series of novels is smoothly made.All in all, excellent work."
4,MANY QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED IN COOK'S LATEST MASTERPIECE.,"Forgive me, Glen! I had to leave off a star because I was crushed at the anticlimactic end to the search for Khatovar. I spent the last few years yearning for the return of Croaker, Murgen, et. al, only to have Sleepy dismiss them out of hand at the end of the book. I respect that time marches on (like the Company), but the old guard should've had a more satisfying fate than they received. On the other hand, I've loved these characters for years--I rather feel like I've been in the Company myself--and I will be there when the next installment hits the shelves."
5,Top Knotch! **Possibly Spoilers**,"This book is the best one in the series! As the style of writing changes from one Annalist to another, I become more and more impressed with Cook's work. Water Sleeps is a must buy. I am already eagerly awaing the next in the series! This truly shows that the series chronicles The Black Company, not just a few selected characters. Excellent."
2,Not worthy of Glenn Cook's authorship,"I have to admit this book was a page turner but only because I was so anxious to find some trace of Cook's previous writing style. Though I have become accustomed to Cook adding new characters and relegating old ones to the background, I am particularly disappointed with his treatment of One Eye, Goblin and Soulcatcher. Has he grown tired of these characters and indulged in some pettiness by portraying them in manners inconsistent with past storylines? Mr. Cook's writing style also contains more profanity and sexual inuendo than before. I am no prude but this all adds up to a significant departure from previous Black Company novels. It bears more resemblance to his writing style in the ""Garrett"" series (ie; ""Petty Pewter Gods""). Please Mr. Cook, examine your writing style and how this latest installment is a glaring departure from previous volumes and not for the better. Thank You."
3,A disapointment,"I really the series, but I think that it should have ended with ""She is the Darkness,"" uless the next book, or series, or whatever he decides to make it, is very good. After reading ""She is the Darkness"" I was eager to read the next and couldn't wait for it to be relaeased. After reading ""Water Sleeps,"" I think I may wait for the next book to be released in paper back before I buy it."
4,Revealing but Depressing to an extent.,"I readily absorbed the huge dose of answered questions and history of the Realm.Spoilers ahead... My dissapointments were the fact that Croaker and Lady had relatively nothing to do with the book at all, except for being there stuck on the plain, white crow notwithstanding.I gave four stars only because I felt let down by the ending, as it related to Lady and Croaker, who after all were the main reasons anyone travelled up the plain anyway, in my oh so humble opinion.After putting this book down I felt like I won Lotto, but my dad who picked the numbers for me died."
2,"400 pages of filler, 80 pages of plot","Possible SPOILER.Since ""Dreams of Steel"", the Black Company has supposedly been moving towards a major league showdown with Kina. However, some 1500 pages later, nothing, and no end in sight. For cryin' out loud, Glen, wrap it up. I need some closure."
5,Michelangelo's Mountain: The Quest for Perfection in the Marble Quarries of Carrara,"An early reference to marble work in Lee, Massachusetts caught my attention and drew me deep into this unique and fascinating account of the marble quarries that provided the raw material for the genius that we all now know as Michelangelo. I glimpsed the quarries from a train window on a trip to Italy a year ago, mistakening them for snow at first, and it's an amazing sight. I highly recommend this book - the stone that inspired the Rennaissance is still there and this story of the mountains of marble is told with a passion that reflects the emotion of those times. A great read."
3,French Country...,This book was okay but NOT the best by far. I was rather disappointed with its contents and lack of style.
4,"Lovely book to dream over, with rules to decorate by","Sumptuous photos of sumptuous French provincial houses, with helpful guidelines about what characterizes French country decors (though I agree with one reviewer that not too many French country houses look like this). I particularly like the author's emphasis on how livable the style is, and find this to be true too. Buyer beware however that French country may look a lot different in an American ranch house: a lot of the charm comes from plastered stone walls, old beams and well-worn tile floors."
2,Sub-standard replacement filter,"This filter is not a genuie Kenmore filter but rather an no name brand replacement. The filter did not wick the water as good as a genuine Kenmore filter nor did it last as long. It virtually stopped wicking after about a month of use while I got a full season of use out of a Kenmore filter in a second humidifier that I have. This filter was much cheaper so I guess you get what you pay for. I would not buy this product again, not a good value."
2,not impressed with these filters,"I've used many different brands of filters for the Sears humidifier and these are not good. They do not have much wicking material, large ""honeycomb"" holes, thus they do not produce much moisture. With less fabric they silt up with the minerals very quickly. After about a week it was hard as a rock (lime) and do not wick. This price was good but you get what you pay for."
3,Satisfactory but expensive,"This wick filter worked satisfactorily initially but our water has a high mineral content and it quickly became coated and much less effecient. This is not a fault of the filter, but we found a less expensive filter worked just as well and it may be better to puchase less expensive filters and replace them more often."
4,Works great for the price,I have a Kenmore humififier that I bought at least ten years ago and this year for the first time couldn't find a replacement filter anywhere. I almost didn't buy this replacement after reading all the negative reviews but it turned out to be my only option.The filter I received was not the same size as the original and not nearly as well made but to be fair it's also a fraction of the price and so far it works great. I see no difference in the amount of water evaporated and for the price I don't mind if I have to replace it more often.
3,Great for treated water...,"I'm sure they're fine with ""soft"" water . We have minerals in our water and the filter didn't last as long as other types we use."
5,"A touching, laugh out loud book you'll want to share","The responses these kids give goes from thoughtful to outlandish. It's entertaining and enlightening. My eight year old niece read the whole thing outloud to her mother in the car. They laughed, teared up and had a good talk after."
3,"A supplement, not a main course...","Much as I'd love to heap praise on this product I'd say you're better off reading the blogs by Michael Totten & Michael Yon about Iraq. These documentaries do, however, make for an interesting supplement. My gratitude to JD Johannes for creating them."
4,Great for the pool!,"This shirt was great for the pool last summer. It kept my son cool while protecting him from the sun. The neck hole was a little tough to get over his head, though."
4,A Haunting Lost Chord,"""The Terezin Requiem,"" a surprisingly short novelization of a performance of Verdi's Requiem in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, provides a succinct but devastating image of the power of art even in the sordid horror of the Nazi world. Raphael Schaechter, the conductor, flies elegantly and engagingly by the seat of his pants to assemble and maintain his ensemble, and the many minor characters who move through it are brilliantly and all-too-briefly drawn. The irony of the Catholic Requiem's reinterpretation by doomed Jews is piquantly stated. As a semi-professional singer, I was inspired by the characters' embrace of a classical work as a bridge between real life and the slow dying of the camp. My only complaint was that the book ended too quickly."
5,One of the Better Books On Style,"This book is very useful. When I found out my style, which I think is a ""classic"" with a ""trendy"" accent, it helped me to understand what kinds of clothes I would look good in, feel good in, and continually reach for in the morning to feel pulled-together, not the victim of the latest fashion-du-jour. In this way, knowing your style type, and improvising (you're free to do that) allows you to make better choices and SAVE MONEY on your wardrobe at the same time."
1,PLEASE Do NOT Buy this Book!,"I would HATE to think of any publisher or author getting any kind of money whatsoever out of a book like this. ""Fabulous You!"" is by far the silliest book I ever have read. Not only does the author attempt to stick each individual into six misnamed and misrepresented catagories, the author also has no basis in the fashion world besides being a petite model... just because she may have picked up a couple facts here and there while modeling does NOT mean that she is qualified to come up with her own nonsensical fashion system. Please save your money!"
4,A book for the new millenium!,"This is a beautiful book that shows how our preconceived notions twist and make ugly a child's innocent desire to practice being a father. The author shows us that playing with dolls is not just for girls, rather it's a way of allowing our sons to get in touch with the more gentle and loving side of themselves."
5,Important book for girls and boys,Glad to have a simple book to teach my nieces that it's ok for little boys to play with dolls. And to teach them that it helps them become good daddies.
3,not sure how my sons' family will accept this book...,"I like the ending,because I want boys going up to care for their babies...age of the child, attitude of the parents should be considered before giving book as a gift. Review written by a grandmother"
3,Karen's Cowboy,"I loved this book. Karen just loved the Cowboy. Everyday she wanted to go, go, go. Her Mom kept getting sore. A long with all the other grown-ups. Andrew was so scared of the wolf howl. He was always worring about it. Karen wanted to help Jon save the ranch. She asked her knew friend that she met at the ranch,Jenny, to help her. And she did. They all go through some very exciting adventures that by the end of the trip she didn't want to leave. This book is very interesting for any age. I recomend you read it. It will help you find your cowboy inside."
5,This book is great!,"This book features the children and librarian from the South Bronx, it is a great book for children to introduce the topic of the library and the process of visiting the library. This is a great book for city kids and country kids!"
3,A Look Memory Problems and Ways of Diagnosing and Reversing Memory Loss,"Dr. Vernon Mark helps the reader understand memory loss; determine specific difficulties in his book ""Reversing Memory Loss."" The subtitle of the book ""Proven Methods for Regaining, Strengthening, and Preserving Your Memory"" discuss how medications, stimulants, depressants, proper diet and good nutrition can be monitored to strengthen your memory.Mark's work can be helpful as a diagnostic tool however I was hoping to find more substance in areas the proven methods the subtitle suggests. Since the book's publication date a lot of research has been and is being done. A look at the authors in the extensive bibliography introduces other experts in the field of brain and memory research. I also found the complete index helpful in pinpointing questions I wanted to specifically address, and for a quick review process.""Reversing Memory Loss"" provides an overview of the memory process and the causes that impact memory loss."
2,Interesting; but lacks practical advice,"This author's take on memory loss is very different from other books I've read. I thought his discussion on negative conditioning and its effect on memory was very interesting. He demonstrated how he is able to differentiate between a conditioned memory loss and real disease by taking an in-depth patient history. He maintains that these conditioned memory losses are reversible; but he never actually reveals his memory enhancing techniques, aside from a few relaxation methods. After reading this book, I left with no practical advise and nothing new to try."
1,Terrible!,"Please look elsewhere for a cake pan. This one has graduated sides which means if you are making a double layer cake it will not stack evenly and look terrible. I followed the tips for ""better baking results"" and one of my cakes stuck to the pan; the other did not, although they were baked side by side using the same batter. I have been baking for years and have never been so disgusted with a product. I had been using Wilton pans, but just moved and couldn't locate them."
5,Great fllavor!,My husband and I have tested many brands of peppercorns but these have the best flavor in our opinion. You pay a little more for this brand but well worth the money.
2,A little outdated,"I was disappointed - I'm planning on an adoption from South Korea and China. This book really followed the time lines and experiences of a Russian adoption. I do think the info for Russian adoptions would be extremely helpful but for myself it wasn't what I was looking for. The info is also dated, though I should have looked at that before I bought the book. I think the date was 94-94.The resources provided good info, but now adays the internet provides just as much if not more info. This book was written pre-internet - or at least in the early stages of internet info.I'd suggest this book for someone interested in european/russian adoption but not asian adoptions."
5,Absolutely Brilliant Book,"So there's something not quite right with your horse, you change this and tweek that and make improvements, but still she is trying to tell you something? this is the book for you. Sooo informative, and covers SO much. I bought the Western version of this for my friend and she loves it. I am a vet and the behaviours she describes in this book are classic and COMMON. I wish all horse riders and saddle fitters would read this. Thank you Joyce Harman"
3,The Horse's Pain-FreeBck and Saddle-Fit Book,"This book has good information that applies to all horses, but it is definitely slanted towards fitted english saddles with a small section on western saddles. I'm a western rider, so I was disappointed there wasn't more information on western saddles. But I still learned alot."
4,Pain-Free Back and Saddle -Fit,This book is easy to read and informative.Not only did I learn about how to tell if a saddle would fit my horse but also how to recognize signs of soreness from poor saddle fit. The book explained how and why a saddle needed to fit the whole back of the horse and how a a saddle could detract or enhance an athletes performance.Saddle fit for the rider were included and even some tips on choosing a saddle blanket.Well worth purchasing.
4,Full of information,I thought this was a very good book. Full of information. The only problem I had with it is she only talks about english saddles. I would still recommend it if you ride western though because there is alot of information that will help you.
4,"Good, but not a magic bullet","Sherrie McGraw,has written a beautifully illustrated book which reflects to the reader (be they student, artist, or collector) exactly as its title defines; the lexicon of the subject of drawing.This book will not teach you to draw, or give you any secrets as to how good drawing is acomplished.This book will identify the elements that a good drawing contains and give the reader some wonderful drawings to study and use as reference.Ms. McGraw would do well to take her chapter, The Elements of Drawing' and expand it into a definative 'how to' book; that would be a welcome addition to the artist's library.In this readers opinion, a more comprehensive book for the student of art is Juliette Aristides','Classical Drawing Atelier'"
1,needs an editor,"This book was purchased based on the Amazon reviews, so I thought it might be helpful to a buyer to write my own review. Unless you are a big fan of Sherrie McGraw I suggest avoiding this book. It's full of sweeping generalizations about what an 'artist' is, and the correct way to go about studying drawing and creating 'art'. I love drawing and learning about drawing, but there was little information to be gained from McGraw's 'insights'. Instead of encouraging study or discussing methods, McGraw is an advocate of 'creativity' and concerned about people studying too much. The book is full of platitudes and is of little use to someone interested in learning more about drawing. If you're looking for one long op/ed piece from McGraw's viewpoint, look no further."
5,Book not availible for 35 dollars!!,This is a great book but be aware that it is not and will not be availible for less than 55 dollars on Amazon. There has been some sort of mistake and it is listed as being availible within 4-6 weeks at a discounted rate. There are currently over 200 people waiting for it at this price and I guarantee none of them have recieved it. Buy it from where you know it is immediately availible. READ FEEDBACK!!! The main seller of this title on Amazon has 95% positive feedback and immediate availibility at 55 dollars a book.
3,Not what I'd hoped,"From reading the other reviews, I was hopeful that buying this book would mean the end of me scouring the internet for definitions of biology terms. That didn't happen. While it has some great in-depth definitions, I just don't find about 40% of the words I look for! My concentration is genetics and immunology (which this dictionary should cover, on an undergrad level at least) and I've found this book to be more a source of frustration than aid. It was not a worthwhile purchase. So I'm still in the market for a good bio dictionary."
4,Review of The Rule of Our Warfare,"This book does not reprint Newman's sermons/essays, but selections from them, each selection one to two pages long. These selections are provided under such headings as ""Enduring the World's Ridicule,""True Christians and Professing Christians,"" and ""The Paradox of Christian Knowledge."" Accordingly, this book seems best for meditation and reflection. The selections are often thought-provoking, being from a great Christian mind, who is on the way to canonization. Personally I very much admire Newman's sermons/essays, and so I bought this book."
5,Highly recommended,"This is exactly what I was looking for. This book gives instructions for making a wide variety of beautiful doors. It covers several types of doors, and gives a number of examples of each type. It illustrates each door with a photograph and a scale drawing. Step-by-step instructions are not always given, but there is enough detail that a non-expert can understand how to build the door. The instructions and illustrations are clear. There are some nice color photographs, too. It also covers door hardware and how to hang a door."
4,rare doormaking books,"It's difficult to find a book that deals with actually building doors from scratch. This book is very good and covers the material well. The designs included in the book are interesting and give good ideas. I bought another book by this author called Doormaking Patterns and Ideas, thinking it would have different information. The books have identical information, just different covers and titles. The publishing dates are different.I would recommend this book for someone who wants to build doors."
2,The worst Ozzfest ever!,"Even with the lacking of such terrible bands a Linkin Park, it makes up with such trash as P.O.D. and 3rd Strike. Songs by Down, Meshuggah, and Hatebreed keep it from getting 1 star."
5,Undaground Legend is gonna be a legendary album,"I knew Lil' Flip was good but wow, I didn't know he was that good. This album was his coming out party and established himself as an elite rapper on this album. Tracks 1, 6, 9, and 12 are my favorites 'cuz of the beat and the lyrics. Every other song is tight too and Lil' Flip we'll be mentioned in the same breath as 2pac, DMX, Snoop Dogg, Biggy, and 50 Cent when it's all said and done. A must have for any rap fan!"
2,Not too good,"This cd was overrated. There were a couple fo real good songs and a bunch of bad ones. It was way overrated, I only reccomend it to serious fans. The best songs are ""Way We Ball"" and ""I Can Do That""."
5,Flip is the real king of the south TI aint sh*t,This is Flip's best album to date. They don't call him the Undergroud Legend for nothing. I think TI is mad cause Flip was getting all the love while his a$$ was locked up in jail. Flip is the real king of the south Clovercity H Town.
2,Overrated,"This album is terrible. The only tight songs on this album are ""713,"" ""Can u see it, ""Get Crunk,"" and ""What Yall Wanna Do"" are the two songs that show that Lil Flip and David Banner have great chemistry. Other than that this album misses especially with ""We Ain't Scared"" and every other song on here. Lil Flip shows potential as a rapper for I like his cockiness, but this is a disappointing album altogether."
2,Honest Criticism,"I liked the first album better , because Flip was more determined and he had better concepts.His first album seemed like he put more work into it. Now the second album on the other hand , i have the tendancy to skip over alot of songs , because they sounded like freestyles . It doesn`t seem as if he put any emphasist on his lyrics . No doubt , im going to support all southern rap artist, but albums like 'Underground Legend ' are reasons why the industry doesn`t respect the southwest region. Im looking forward to the next album to be alot better , aleast i hope so."
2,this is whack,lil flip flow is so lazy he dont even put feelin in his songs and that makes it sound so boring. i fell asleep on this album. i'm glad i dint buy it. my friend let me hear it.he raps so slow. its like drag and his rhymes are too simple like kindergarten. this is my opinion.
1,Flip is Garbage,To me anything this man put out is garbage if it ain't T.I. then it ain't right. King of the South T.I. get ya weight up Flip or hang the mic up!
5,Sick Flows,"Flip spit some sick flows on this album, my favorite song is RIP Screw, i think its great that flip recognized screw and all dem with this. i shoulda listened is also a great song. overall, this is more like a 4 1/2, but didnt feel like underrating it."
3,Spectrum Diversified 44710 Coffee Mug tree,"I was happy with the style and was unhappy to find when I opened the box, on of the balls on the base had fallen off, maybe during shipping. I did not want to send it back as I didn't have time. I fixed it with glue, it looks messy, but it is functional."
2,dissatisified,received broken. not worth the trouble of sending it back. these things should be checked better before they are sentspectrum mug holder
4,It works...and it hasn't fallen over yet.,"I really needed a tree mug. My husband drinks obscene amounts of coffee and since he has several mugs, they were taking up lots of cabinet space. We have a tiny kitchen so this seemed like a good idea. I did not realize that this had little feet, yeah, I know, they are in the picture...but I just did not knotice them. They have not had any adverse effects on the balance, so I am not complaining about them. The only real issue I have with this is the arms are so curly that it can be difficult in my early morning, sleep addled state, to get the mugs off the tree. I can say this has kept the cat from knocking them off, as more than once I have caught her up on the counter activly trying to find out what is in them. So in review...does this work like it is supposed to, yes. Does this look good, yes, does it seem sturdy, yes. Would you recomend this, yes. I also purchased several matching items with this, and it looks really good as a set."
1,"Bad Remakes of Erasure, Really Hard to Listen to","I am a fan of Erasure and have seen them live. I purchased a tribute CD called Sometimes: Tribute to Erasure from 1999. It was a nice lounge-style remix. THIS CD, was terrible. They try to replicate the same sound of erasure and the same vocals and do it poorly. I played it for a friend who is also a big fan and he was in pain. I am not sure why they made this CD. Listen to a track on Amazon before you buy it to see what I mean. This was a bad purchase. I have no idea who would like this over original Erasure."
5,Dragonstone is Dennis McKiernan's greatest epic to date.,"""The Dragonstone"" is perhaps Dennis McKiernan's finest workyet. It follows the quest of Arin, an Elven lady with theability to see future events. Her latest vision deals witha mysterious green stone that even the dragons fear - and awar so terrible it could bring about the end of the world.With the aid of five companions, Arin must trek across theface of Mithgar and into the heart of peril, for her questwill change the fate of the world forever."
2,"Rambling, mundane adventure tale.","This was the first work I've read by McKiernan and while there is much worse out there, there is also much better. This is your ordinay quest adventure, in which the author moves the reader around as a small heroic band seek out a magical object which will save their world. Sound familiar? The heroes and heroines are humans and elves that all pair up at the end, the enemy is an evil wizard, and the world is populated with trolls and dragons. I could live with all of this if the story offered anything new or was well told. But instead the reader spends a lot of time in tedious travel or recounting plots thread worn by anyone who has ever played D&D or read Tolkien. It's not that McKiernan doesn't know how to write, but simply that he doesn't seem to be able to breath any freshness or life into his story. Look elsewhere unless you're simply looking for a way to pass the time."
2,Uh...no.,"I've read some of Dennis's work before, the into the Forge set, and I thought it wasn't so bad for classic fantasy...though it dragged a little. So I decided to pick up an earlier book to see how much better it would be. I was horrible surprised to find it was worse. The book's beginning wasn't too bad. You can't help but mutter at the characters' unbelievable stupidity in solving the riddles. Even the long lived elf Arin is pretty clueless. Another problem, is Dennis describes everything in WAY too much detail...600 pages of nothing is a little much. I was kind of disgruntled after reading this book, because the ending wasn't epic in any way. The drunk that doesn't really accomplish anything for the whole book dies (and believe me, I'm not giving anything away). Wow...I could care less about a guy who drags the rest of the party down with him. If you want epic...read David Gemmel's Winter Warriors. Now that is some truly epic stuff."
2,Book is missing part of a chapter,"I normally like McKiernan's books but this one is missing at least part of a chapter. Near the climax there is some interation missing between the people on the quest and the dragon guarding their objective. The text refers to a promise the dragon made and one character's opinion that he won't keep his word. I looked back twice to see if I missed anything but there was no convsersation. One of the chapters is very short, less than a page and it appears that it may be incomplete. I like his stories but bad editing is inexcusable."
1,McKiernan Sells Out!,"One of the great things about McKiernan's earlier works was an aire of believabilty about a classic fantasy epic, i.e. the assertion by McKiernan that the stories are taken from ancient and recently found manuscripts written comtemporarily with the events described; the maps used in his books roughly approximating modern-day Europe, etc. However, when he makes one of his central characters a sword-wielding 5'2"" girl who is unstoppable in battle, his credibility as a writer snaps. I assume McKiernan, wanting to be accepted by the liberal, feminist elites in the literary community, thought he better do something to show them he's on board. Frankly, I was sorry to see him sell out."
1,Save your money....,"I've been reading fantasy novels for 15 years and this story lacked excitement and creativity. Not only did it start slow it ended slow. I forced myself to finish the book because I spent 6 bucks for it. Stories like these can usually end in 200 or less pages. This one had close to 600. If you need any help falling asleep, then this is the book for you. (Oh yeah, a Nympho/Nutso queen?...please)"
2,Cover has nothing to do with content,"Blah. Torture.I love this genre, but the names were like razors in the mouth. The characters superficial. The pace plodded on, while the characters plodding along from port to port.Barely a dragon in sight and none of the characters were noble. Not even the elves.The only reason I didn't give this just one star was because, well, there were a few scenes with elves and some with dragons, so just seeing those words makes it a little better than a text book.I was really disappointed - even the bad guy was beyond predictable. YAWN"
1,I wish I could give 0 stars,"I picked this up since I wanted to try an author that I have never read. I now wish that I didn't pick up this book.I will say that I did not finish it, after reading up to page 74 I gave up. I could see where the plot was going already and like many others have said the character are just cookie cutter characters.The worst part, in just the short bit that I read, was the author's description of an area. 71 words to in one sentence to describe an area. That was just the latest one. There were others.If you like boring fantasy novels that go into the minutest detail of describing an area this book is for you."
1,BS,"I am sick and tired of these ""moon hoax"" people and I wish they'd all go away to fairyland where they belong."
4,Good Job,It appears the government has accomplished what it has set out to do reading from all the broad-minded reviews.
2,problems after problems,"I was really excited to buy a new computer. after few hours of installing stuffs and experiencing the fastness, problems started to show up. First of all i think hp computer doesn't match well with ATI radeon graphic cards. It would often show error messages and when it tries to resize the moniter, it would just restart the computer. and the hp printer doesn't work well with hp computer. Have to try 4~5 times to get a copy (waste of paper). Its just a pc with flaws."
2,Dissappointed not a true waterless shampoo,"I was looking for a quick smell fixer on my two labrador retrievers that I have.I was in the market for a waterless shampoo to cut down on bathing time and mess from using water.Unfornuately this product does not do that for, I still must wet down the pooch then spray on the shampoo and then towel dry off. So really this shampoo only takes off the step involving rinsing the animal. The smell was ok but nothing to rave about.I will be searching for another product that better suits my expectations and is truly waterless.I will admit that in the instructions on the site it says to wet down the dog, but I saw it after i ordered the shampoo and thus the product shouldnot be labeled waterless."
1,Defective Bottle,I purchased this product based on the reviews. The first bottle arrived leaking in its packing. I ordered a replacement and low and behold that bottle leaked too. I'm now getting a refund.
3,High-level Overview,"This book provides a high-level overview of many of the issues surrounding an ERP implementation. However, the coverage is superficial and repetitive. I think a 10-page summary of this material would be much more useful than this 200-page book. Often I felt like the book was more of an advertisement for a consulting company than a serious treatment of the issues involved in implementing an ERP system. Still, it may help one who is inexperienced in this area to know some of the important questions to ask before and during the implementation."
2,Very broad and superficial review of ERP implementation,"It covers ERP implementation in very broad strokes, and gives a superficial overview of each step. The book may be good for managers just embarking on the ERP implementation process. However, if you are looking for detailed steps and procedures, this book is not for you."
2,"Important topic, but superficial treatment!","This book identifies all the important areas in enterpise software package implementation. However, I was really disappointed with the superficial treatment overall. Much of the stuff looks old - material that has been around in books on project management for a long long time. It would have been invaluable if the author had focused in detail on the two key areas (package selection and package implementation) and provided more specific tools/techniques etc."
5,Another great nutshell reference,"This is another fine nutshell series book. It is easy enough to read, but gives enough detail to power users to allow them to uncover advanced features easily. The book is very well balanced. Beginnners may not feel right at home, but if you have been using Outlook for any period of time, this book is a valuable addition to your library. Well worth the price."
1,Hard to use if you are not Windows literate,I am a Mac user and I need to learn Outlook 2000 for Windows.I am not Windows literate and so I found this book to be very technical and hard to understand.If you are familiar with the ins and outs of Windows I am sure you will find this book helpful.I guess I am in the Outlook for Dummies category!
5,Veronica Mars/girl detective,"I really enjoyed watching this series, that I didn't want to do anything but watch the show all the way through. Veronica Mars is just the right amount of seriousness and edge. Lots of fun thrown in as well. She handles herself like a pro and it is very entertaining. I will buy the third season when it comes out.I was a little disapointed that there were no subtitles for season two like there was in season one. If you like mystery buy this series."
5,Thoroughly Recommended,"The second season of Veronica Mars is as watchable as the first, with the added benefit of the departure of the rather wooden Teddy Dunn. With characters that are both memorable and likable, no matter how many shades of grey they possess, it is no wonder this is a perennial favourite with the young and young at heart."
4,Not as good as season 1 but worth watching,"My husband and I enjoyed season I and had great expectations for the second season as well. The characters are a bit more trashy in the second season to the point where it can distract from the plot. On the positive side, there are plenty of laughs and witty come-backs that keep things light. Overall, I would purchase this set again."
3,Great show. Disc scratched.,I loved this show. It arrived quickly however the last disc was scratched and several minutes of the show get skipped.
1,"Love the show, but I need my subtitles, dammit!","I enjoyed the first season of Veronica Mars immensely, and was looking very much forward to season two. But the lack of English subtitles has prevented me from watching the season even though I bought it. As a non-native English speaker, I very often need to rely on the subtitles to follow the snappy dialogue, and while every tv series I ever bought to this point has had them they're apparently disappearing (missed them on the new Gilmore Girls dvd set as well). The choice is now limited to French or Spanish, neither of which I understand. Please, please put the English subtitles back in!"
2,Why no English subtitles?,"I rented Season 1 from the library to make sure I liked this series. I was hooked and it became my ""workout"" video. After completing Season 1, I bought all three seasons for my collection. I anxiously popped the first DVD from Season 2 into the machine to begin my usual workout and much to my dismay found that even though the shows are in English, the subtitles are only in Spanish and French. Season 1 and Season 3, however, have English subtitles, furthering confusing the issue of ""what were they thinking?"". What is with that? Considering it was intended to be my entertainment while I worked out on a treadmill (which is noisy), the lack of English Subtitles was significant."
5,Girls Love Unicorns!!!,"We can all pick apart this show's second season till the cows come home. It's way too complicated, it's highly implausible and maybe even impossible at times. But here's the bottom line. It's a smart and funny show with likable, even lovable (Veronica/Wallace/Keith) characters.Let's just enjoy it while we can, 'cause we all know that shows that respect their audience's intelligence have no place on network TV."
5,Cancelling Veronica Mars was a crime against Humanity,"How is Veronica Mars cancelled and Two and a Half Men on!? What is WRONG with people? Now, I know I jumped the Veronica Mars train late in the game, but this show is AWESOME! The characters are fun and well defined, and the plot lines are intriguing. The best thing about the show is a toss up between excellent writting and phenomenal actors. Thats a great toss up to have. I cannot believe that they only lasted three seasons. I am a proud DVD owner of this series, I hope to find another like it someday."
4,Blonde gets in people's business,"I have not finished this season, we took a break from watching it every night to catch up on The League. I'm sure this season would have blown my mind when it first aired."
5,One of the Best Shows on TV.,"Veronica Mars is one of the best shows on TV. I just got my 2nd season DVD a few days ago. While watching it I had some people who have never seen it and and both loved it, one who never watches any TV. But this has changed their minds about nothing good ever being on TV.This season starts with Veronica continuing to help classmates by solving their problems while also having a season long mystery or 2 to try and solve."
5,LOVE this show - need MORE stars to rate it!,"I'm incredibly excited about the impending release of season two on DVD, and desperately hope that the execs in charge of such things will sign up for several more seasons of Veronica Mars.The writing is superb, filled with intrigue, humor, well-developed characters and storylines. The actors portray their characters with an amazing amount of heart and a clear dedication to the craft of acting. I simply can't rave enough about this wonderful show and all who are connected with it's production. It's truly a gem, standing out brightly against so much of the absolute junk on television today.It's never too late to become a fan of a fantastic show - if you're not yet familiar with Veronica Mars, I'd highly recommend you give it a chance. If you enjoy witty, well-written television, this show is a MUST SEE."
4,good,it was a good product. The quality was good. none of the disc were scratched but im kinda unimpressed that i wasnt informed that there was no dust cover.
4,When Will Mars 4 Come,"Overal star rating for all three seasons (storyline, drama, pace, suspension, etc.)Season 1, 5Season 2, 4.5Season 3, 5It's the best seriese for all age groups (I have two highschool kids don't watch the screen w/ parents oftern, but this series kept them stay.) Sad that Mars won't come any more, but any chance to see Season 4's script published?"
2,No extras,"I adore this show and I was really looking forward to the DVD set. I buy many tv shows on DVD because I love the backstory. I want to hear why the producers and writers made the choices they did, I want to hear about the arcs and all the background on making a tv program. The extra with Kristen Bell was great but there were no commentaries. I am still a big fan of the show but there wasn't enough extra on the DVD set to warrant the price. I can record the show on TV and have pretty much the same thing."
3,"Uninteresting, unimportant, unexceptional","Everything about this is average. The plot, the script and the main heroine's acting. Fiction-haters would probably pick this over Buffy, but it would have been their loss. This is too much like having a camera following a regular high school girl through her experiences in life. If that's your cup of tea, you may enjoy this. Otherwise there's much better similar stuff elsewhere. Cough*buffy*cough..."
2,Harmless but Overrated,"The show is relatively harmless teen schlock, but in general I've found it to be quite overrated. Not bad television, but no where near as wonderful as it's generally purported to be.If you like teen angst, you'll enjoy it. If you are a stickler for details or you find yourself irritated by teenagers making pop-cult references to the 80s that are more indicative of a writing staff in their 30s and 40s than to anything actual teenagers would say, you'll probably find yourself annoyed.Not awful. Not great. But if you love WB teen soaps, it's probably right up your alley."
5,Best Show on Television,Not as stellar as season 1 but many shows aren't. It is much more fluid when watching the DVDs then watching with big delays and reruns we had during the original tv airing. You couldn't ask for a better cast with incredible chemistry and great dialogue. The mystery wrap up is well done.
5,veronica mars 1st and 2nd seasons,"I really enjoyed the first and second seasons of veronica mars. Expertly written, casted, and developed. Kristen Bell is wonderful. She carried the series well and I look forward to seeing the third season. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't get bored. I'm glad it went to dvd."
4,Veronica Mars Season 2,Nice DVD box with 6 DVDs (22 episodes) and a small booklet with episode-description. Not many extra`s on the DVD (only one or two deleted scenes).I did find the look of the episodes a bit to red/ satured.Does NOT comes with English subtitles (French and Spanish are included. Season 1 does have English subs).I must rank the stories below those of season one but all in all still a must have for the Veronica Mars fan at this low price..
2,Far inferior to season one,"Veronica Mars was a great show... the first season. Second season was a huge disappointment. The mystery is extremely convoluted with a lot of plotlines that end up going nowhere. Season one was one of the best seasons of any television show ever because the character relationships were compelling and believable, the mini-mysteries each episode were fun, and the season-long mystery was brilliantly plotted out so we made progress each episode toward an extremely satisfying ending.In season two the dialogue is still sharp and the acting is good, so it's still kinda fun to watch. But the season-long mystery is a mess that gets so complicated you need a spreadsheed to keep up and the character relationships feel tired and phony. If you haven't watched this show, just get season one. If you've watched season one, be warned that you'll be disappointed by season 2."
4,Barry Ween Version 1.0,"Before Judd Winick became a writer of superhero comics, he wrote (and drew) this comedy series about a boy with a 350 IQ. Barry Ween is a foul-mouthed, sarcastic, junior mad scientist. Sometimes his experiments go wrong, which is where the humor comes from. Be advised that while this comic is about kids, it's not actually for kids (although it's ok for teens)."
5,Dokken...still Rokken,Dokken fans will love this effort and everyone else wont deny its merit. We all miss George but this lineup captures that 80's sound many of us grew up with. Keep it up guys!!
3,Bland!,"This was a tough listen, because I love Don Dokken. The attempts at heaviness here come off as metal ""light."" The alloy sound is probably due to poor mixing; as though Don doesn't really care if a band is behind him or not. The writing and vocals are solid, but there seems to be little energy in the execution. The trademark ""Lynch"" minor key sound is there on the guitar, but the ""sparks flying off of the fretboard"" grittiness is just not there. This would be a marginally average release for the musical genre that it comes from (mid 80's), yet today it holds up a little better than all of the crap out there called rock. Please kick it up a notch, Don!"
3,Takes a few listens to get into it,"The good:1. There are a few really strong tunes (Prozac Nation, Escape, The Last Goodbye)2. It's a little (just a little) heavier than Long Way Home3. Jon Levin does a good George Lynch impersonation4. At least it's not ShadowlifeThe not-so-good1. Too many mid-tempo songs from a band best known for hard drving rock2. Don steers clear of any high-register stuff--leaving one to assume he can't hit the high notes any more.3. This is minor, but still--the album cover art is weak. Like an elementary school art project"
5,this release rocks!!!!,"they finally have a release here without george that the whole cd is great and timeless, meaning you do not get tired of it AND IT ROCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JON LEVIN AND CO. GIVES US a great cd and i m very hard on bands because i dont like to see people spend their money on releases with only 1 or 2 good songs.cant wait for there next cd titled (lightening strikes again) anything more you need to know, nope"
3,"It's average, but better than Long Way Home","Knowing full well that Dokken fans expect the CD to open with a barnstormer along the lines of ""Kiss of Death"" or ""Erase the Slate,"" it's puzzling that Dokken chose a mid-paced song. For that matter, the entire CD is generally mid-paced. The songs are all pretty good, but nothing that truly grabs you upon first listen. New guitarist Jon Levin tries to impersonate George, but only half-succeeds due to the material. He's good, but you couldn't pick his playing out of a lineup. Not that this is necessary for Dokken at this point. But what is necessary is one last Rockin' with Dokken CD before these boys call it a day. I hope they can pull it off. I also hope they go out with style and don't overstay their welcome, which I'm sure many suspect they already have."
3,A tough cover for a weak album,"I love Dokken, I love my rock with melody, the same reason I love Stryper and Def Leppard. When I saw this album's cover I was expecting Tooth and Nail part 2, but that is not the case. Like other modern Dokken albums this one is about 50% of what could it be. There is basically no power in the sound, melody is there and the guys play but there is no spirit to it. For the completist is a good buy, for fans of the old Dokken, go for Lightning Strikes Again."
3,Buen Disco,el disco no es lo que esperaba dijeron que seria un back to the 80 but never happen. have some good songs the guitars is the best pure classic dokken style but need more intesity like back for the attack and little more of power like under luck but compare to the new music of today the album esta tremendo puro metal
2,not what i expected,"With all the 4 & 5 star reviews, I really got excited about this Dokken release. Just goes to show that the majority of people don't know what they are talking about. This album has like 2 or 3 OK songs. The rest is just incredibly boring and lifeless. I've listened to this album a few times in the hope of it growing on me. Didn't happen. It has way to many slow, melodic songs on it. That's a shame b/c the guitarist seems like he could hold his own with Lynch. Also, Don just seems to be bored and sedated. I remember when a Dokken album didn't have 1 filler song in the whole bunch. Even the songs that weren't singles were awesome. You could listen to the CD front to back and have a helluva ride. Since Back for the Attack, it seems that Dokken has been on a slow, sleep inducing downward spiral and that's disapointing. Don't even get me started on the disater called Shadowlife. At least I can take solace in the fact that I bought this used for around 4 bucks."
2,Album sucks,"Im a dokken fan, but i tell you it seems their heyday really is over now. Lets face it, Dokken really needs an excellent guitarist and they just dont have those killer leads anymore. There are maybe two good songs on this album, Escape and The Last goodbye. The rest range from mediocre to bad. If you want to hear good Dokken, then Back for the Attack is as good as it gets, Under lock and key is pretty good as well, and the first Don Dokken solo album is great also."
3,"Dokken : ""Hell To Pay""","*** 1/2 STARS---------------This is a solid release from Dokken. I longed for the days when Dokken would get back to their roots, and ""Hell To Pay"" is a very nice return of sorts....The guitars are very good. New axeman J. Levin does a very impressive job, and does make me think of the days when G. Lynch was shreading away. A very welcome addition to the Dokken line-up he is...I wouldn't classify this as ""Tooth And Nail"" or ""Under Lock And Key"", but it'c certainly the best Dokken has released since then in my opinion. I use to be a huge Dokken fan in the 80's, and once Don went solo, I wasn't interested anymore. I did buy ""Erase The Slate"", but wasn't very impressed. ""Hell To Pay"" is much more enjoyable, and has that 80's feel to it....A nice addition to your Dokken collection. I was surprised at how good this is, and I hope Don sticks with this current line-up in the furture. I still miss G. Lynch though...."
4,Very solid album,"This album is a breath of fresh air compared to the bands previous release. Jon Levin is the perfect fit for this band without George Lynch. Of the four guitarists (Beach, Norum, Derosso, Levin) the band has had since George's departure I would say Levin captures the Dokken sound more than the rest. (Not to say that these three others are not good in their own right). The best songs on the album in my opinion are ""Last Goodbye"", ""Escape"", ""Don't bring me down"", ""Prozacnation"" , ""Haunted"" , ""I surrender"" , ""Still I'm sad"" , ""Care for you"". The other three are ok but nothing special. This is the type of album that the more you listen to it the better it gets. Definitely worth purchasing."
4,Bob Hope's Casanova Flick,Bob Hope's movies are always witty and fun -- this is one of the minor efforts but well worth the pleasure from the classic age of movie comedies. Very good DVD from a fine seller rates AAA++++.
3,Farfle Farfle Piffik,"Bob Hope had had a great success a decade earlier in spoof costume films, so Paramount concocted this trifling little bore. It has moments of amusement but was regarded (rightly) as a professional humiliation by Joan Fontaine, who together with Basil Rathbone, had seen better days in Regency costume."
3,Casanova's Big Night,"This movie is towards the end of Bob Hope's ""golden age"" but it's still an entertaining movie. He plays Pippo who is the assistant to Casanova's tailor. Hope assumes the role of Casanova which leads to many complications that Pippo is not able to handle. Vincent price makes an unbilled appearance as Casanova. Basil Rathbone is great as the real Casanova's valet &, therefore, valet to Pippo's Casanova. It's a unusual comedic role for him that he is suited for; Rathbone's most famous roles being Sherlock Holmes & the Sheriff of Nottingham in the Adventures of Robin Hood.DVD quality is excellent but there aren't any bonus features. Enjoy this one. By the very late 50's & early 60's Hope would change directions somewhat in his roles which led to a drop off in quality for his movies."
4,Casanovas Big Night 1954,"Its bedlam in the boudoir when Bob Hope (1903-2003) sets his comedic sights on 18-th century Italy . Hope plays Pippo Popolino , a lowly tailor who is suddenly drafted to tempororarily impersonate the great and passionate lover Casanova (an unbilled Vincent Prince 1911-1993) .Pippo thinks he has the masquerade all sewn up -totally unaware that , due to the real Casanovas shaky financial situation , he is now locked into the role by the Romancers scheming , greedy creditors ! . Along the way , our great lover manages to woo some lovely ladies ( Joan Fontaine 1917 - ) and Audrey Dalton (1934- ) -when hes not dodging spontaneous swordsplay or bumling his way through the finer points of royal etiquette . Basil Rathbone (1892-1967) Hugh Marlowe (1911-1982) , Arnold Moss (1910-1989) and John Carradine (1906-1988) are among the stellar cast in this lavishly costumed comedy romp . Laughts guarantee ! Superb transfer in H-D Quality"
5,What a fun movie!,"I loved this movie! Just so much fun. Swashbuckling goodness in a comedy is always a good thing. It was fun to watch Joan Fontaine with a sword. Sets & costumes were excellent, the acting was very good. Loved Bob's humor, always do. I also recommend these other Bob Hope movies:The Princess & The PirateMonsieur BeaucaireThe Road to Rio"
5,"Wonderful Series,","but buy the first three seasons boxed set for $85, and the fourth season seperately for $30, and you will save $30 off this compilation (seasons 1-4 boxed set)."
1,Not even close of Seinfield,"I Don't subscribe HBO, for that reason I thought this show was a bomb like most people said, I do have all 10 season of friends and I will have all of Seinfeld(soon as come out) but this program is very hard to swallow. I am on second episode of 4th season and that's it, I got to sell those DVD's. My biggest mistake was bought the first 4 season at once."
1,DO NOT INSTALL THE B'S GOLD SOFWARE!,"Update of previous review:This drive works FABULOUS as long as you do not ever load the Bs Gold Clip software that comes with it.TRUST ME the sofware is nothing but problems, endless downloads of patches, failed burns, and on and on and on...just a mess! If you have it installed you can NOT even use the Windows based burning program.I really thought this drive stunk...HOWEVER once I uninstalled that awful softare and used the Windows XP burning program...PRESTO all the problems disappeared!Great hardware--stay away from the software! I'd give it 5 stars now...if I could change that part of my review that is."
4,Cape Cod Summers,"This was fun reading. I found myself looking forward to the time in the evening when I could read another chapter. His humorous description of a childhood spent on the Cape brought back many of my own summer memories of long ago. Loved his honesty and uncomplicated,enjoyable stories of just being a kid spending his summers with his family. He has great recall and couldn't help but wish this experience was available to more kids."
2,There are better ones out there.,"I bought this CD based on the rave reviews on Amazon, and it's a disappointment. The collection on the CD are not as beautiful as those on the Jane Austen Companion album, which I think is much better and more reminiscence of the Jane Austen period, or at least the movie remake. The music on this CD are beautifully played, but they aren't and won't be my favorite pieces. Mediocre pieces at best. If I get to preview this album on amazon, I won't have bought it. On the other hand, the Jane Austen Companion can be previewed on amazon, it's grander pieces, and it's even cheaper than this album."
4,Go back in time,"An excellent choice for when you want to go back in time, just relax, or curl up with a good book (especially something by Jane Austin)."
5,Jessamy,"I am 10 years old and Jessamy by far is the best book I have ever read! I almost feel like I know Jessamy. It all started when my aunt gave me the book just to read, it looked old and beat up. I took the book home with me, read it, and I thought WOW! this is the best book I have ever read! I wish I could read more about Jessamy, I wish it was a series. If Jessamy was a real person, I'd do anything possible to meet her. I rate Jessamy a five-star book!"
5,"A classic--mystery, time travel and a very real heroine!","Like many of the other people who reviewed here, I also read the book as a child (in New Zealand, around the age of 10 or so) and I have never forgotten it! I was excited tosee others had loved it as much. Barbara Sleigh was a British author, and I enjoyed some of her other books, too. (""No One Must Know"", ""Carbonel"", etc.) But ""Jessamy"" is thebest of them all. I loved the heroine and found it very exciting when she went back in time to be the 'other' Jessamy from days gone by. Now I want to get it for myown daughters."
5,works great,Installed easily with my Directv box and works great very happy with it and all the features that go with it remote easy to use. would recommend this
1,unable to use,Unable to use this DVD player because it was not compatible with any of my TV's. I have four TV sets. I was not able to connect with any of them. I would like to know compatibility. This DVD is only useful if you are connecting it to a video projector or a computer.
3,"GODD, BUT FAR FROM BEING THE BEST",I completely agree with the review of Mr.Scott Morrison and I would still point out a strange thing I noticed in my SACD: there is a pause between the tracks as if each track were an individual song. There should be no pause except between the first and the second movements. It is strange that Pentatone did not notice this problem before releasing this SACD.
5,A great and thrilling book.,"This is the kind of book that you can read over and over again. Whether you are young or even a little older this book is a great read. Naya Nuki is a young Indian girl on the run. Her story is true and makes us truly appreciate the kind of life she lived. The most amazing thing about this book is that it's based on ture story. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read more about indian life or just a good book. It's not a hard book to read, but definitly worth while."
5,Childhood favorite,"This book was one of my favorite stories when I was little and remains a favorite now that I'm an adult. Like all of Thomasma's stories about Indian children, this book is geared toward a younger set, as evidenced by the more simplistic style. However, this does not lessen the enjoyment to be had from reading this compelling story. This is a story worth reading at any age."
5,Excellent Children's Book,"I met Mr. Thomasma eight years ago at a reading convention in Nebraska. I took this book back to my students and they loved it as I read it outloud. After moving into administration, I purchased this book and other Thomasma books for the elementary library. The kids love them! They are always in high demand."
