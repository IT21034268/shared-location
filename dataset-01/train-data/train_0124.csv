5,The best of the Redwall series!,"In my opinion, Redwall is the best book of the series Redwall series. (However, the other books are excellent as well, which only shows how high asteem in which I hold this book.) The descriptions are excellent, and the characters are beleivable as well as enduring. This book is well worth the money of any adventure or fantasy fan."
5,Great adventure for anyone over the age of eleven!,"I first got into these books when I was eleven or twelve years old. I fell in love with it from the first chapter! I am now entering my 30's and want to read them again! Also, I love introducing them to my sixth grade students. I had one student finish this book in three days! He couldn't put it down! It has plenty of action and adventure for the boys and a little romance for the girls. Jacques has created a colourful world that will make you want to shrink down and join in their festivities. After you finish this first book, check out all the other books in the ""Redwall"" world. So rip that ""Twilight"" book out of your child's hands and replace it with this series! It's good, old-fashioned, clean fun that kids of all ages will enjoy!"
4,a great book but not his best,"This is a great book but not as good as the others, a librarian recomended it to me and i was so hooked i finished it one day!it is about a young mouse named Matthias who is clumsy and longs to be like martin the warrior. then the redwall abbey is under siege by cluny the scourge who is bent on destruction of redwall. Mathias sets out to find martins legendary sword thinking it will help redwall...A MUST READ!"
5,The Original Redwall,"This book is a legend of fantasy. It is the starting point for one of the greatest series ever, the point where new and old readers always return to. A book overflowing with fun, wit, riddles, old friends, and adventure never seen since the tales of King Arthur, Redwall never fails to delight again and again. The quest is dangerous, the characters courageous, and the feasts suberb! Return to the brave battles of good against evil, where good must triumph but evil is always lurking. A book for anywhere, anytime, anyone, Redwall will draw you into a world of wonder."
4,redwall revew by philip baker,redwall is a story of a mouse named matemeyo who must find the sword of martin the warrier to save redwall abby from the evil rat cluney and his evil hord. in the end he saves the abby and kills cluney.
5,Why mice?,"Brian Jaques brings to life in the Redwall series a fantasy lived by many young children: animals that talk and live thier own human like lives, Mice, squirrels, otters, birds, rats, weasels, a badger and other critters populate tis popular series, which tends to mock medevil human life.Along with a stunning ability to make animals work in a social group much like humans, he seems to have an overwhelming knowledge of cooking, swordplay, and herbal healing.I recommend this book to anyone with children that are into fantasy and animals, if your children like Stuart Little, or Cats&Dogs, give this series a try."
4,Redwall,"I think that this book is a great book to read because it will keep your attention. There are many interesting characters in this book such as sparrows, snakes, badgers, moles, rats, mice... This book is about an army of rats lead by the evil Cluny who tries to take over Redwall. Matthias is trying to get back Martin the Warriors's sword from... whoever has it. In this book and especially in the battles lots of characters die."
2,Ho-hum,"This is a very stock -- stock, stock, stock! -- children's tale, with recycled characters and events. Reading this would be preferable to poking one's eye out with a stick if it were a rainy day and the kids had absolutely nothing better to do."
2,oKAY,This book was okay but it got confusing at times and the story got often boring. But I recomend this book to redwall fans.
2,Redwall,"The book Redwall will be a good book if you enjoy tall tales and folklore. If you are a romance or a nonfiction type person, than Redwall would not be the book for you. This tall tale is about a little peaceful town called Redwall, or so I thought. Redwall was no longer the peaceful little town when Cluny arrived. Cluny the Scourge was someone that everyone in Redwall despises. Cluny is determined to take over Redwall and destroy it. But the Abbot and his crew are not about to let that happen. No one is going to destroy Redwall as long as Matthias is around. To find out more read the book for yourself."
2,Not Impressed,"My daughter is an avid reader to say the least. I love to read as well and generally read any book before she does (yes, I'm a bit over protective..) but I have to say this:While this first book is extremely creative, the author is long-winded and overly descriptive.If you're a Redwall fan, GREAT, I certainly don't begrudge anyone, but to us this book was a huge disappointment after all the hype."
2,Only for Small Children,"Some people have said that this book is for adults as well as children, but that definitely isn't the case here. Some books are classified as children's or young adults' (e.g. His Dark Materials; The EarthSea series;) which are really for adults. Some other series for children can also be enjoyed by adults, eg Wrinkle in Time. But this book is really only good for children. Most adults won't even enjoy it, unless they like reading children's books to get them in a nostalgic mood. The concepts are presented in a simple fashion, the language is also very plain, characterization is at a minimum and the plot isn't too complicated. This reminded me of Watership Down, but at a much simpler level. A good read for a young child (around 9 yrs old or less), maybe; but I didn't like it much."
2,"Cute critters, graphic violence","This book occupies an odd place on the ""children's book"" shelf: it attracts young readers with mice and other forest cutesies but delivers action that is often graphically cruel--way beyond kid-book level, in my opinion. And yet the characters seem too cutesy to attract older readers. After seeing too many times the tears and the shock on my 8-year-old's face, I felt the need to gloss over some of the graphically violent stuff,despite my aversion to censorship of any kind. I wouldn't recommend this one for anyone under 11 or 12, and only then if readers/listeners don't mind fuzzy little forest creatures getting graphically impaled, drowned, and/or crushed alive."
1,Gruesome!!!!,"I have to say 'Redwall' is one of the worst books I've ever tried to read. Jacques tries over and over to get you attatched to the characters(with scanty success) just to kill them off in disgusting ways. The plot is centered around a rather uncreative point - a rat attacking some (talking!)mice. The book seemed to be five million pages long -I could barely force myself to wade through it. In my opinion, the violence and bad language make it inapropriate for children. Don't waste your time on it!"
4,My thoughts,"The book Redwall was very intresting.Many times I did have to read the pages more then once to understand it completly,but I did enjoy the book.Its a story about Matthias the mouse who is working hard to keep Cluny and his men from destroying Redwall Abbey.The story has many exciting parts and when I understood them I loved them.Even though I was worried that I would enjoy the book I learned to never judge a book by its cover,or number of pages."
5,Redwall Was Stupendous!,Redwall was one of my most favorite books!! My favorite characters were Constance and Warbeak because it showed people that girls are strong too. I hope that more books like Redwall are yet to come!!!
5,Wonderful book,"This is a wonderful book and wonderful series. I read it years ago and am now looking at it for my children. There is adventure, danger, sadness, bravery and heart! Really a good book."
5,Enjoy,"This story was fun, fun, fun. I'm looking forward to Mossflower. It's great for kids as well as adults. It's all about action but it also allows you to get into the characters. Big fun"
5,Redwall,"Redwall is an awesome book that throws you into the story.When I first started reading Redwall,it erased all the other thoughts in my mind.I only focused on the book.Kids and aduls of all ages should read this book.And when they finish,continue on to the other books in the series.You will never forget,and you'll never regret it."
3,Review,"I think Redwall is a good book. The book seems like it is all real. The book almost makes you think that it could really happen. It is about a young mouse named Matthias, that tries to save his abbey from a nasty evil rat named, Cluny the Scourge. Matthias is inspired to save his abbey by a legend, Martin the Warrior. Matthias goes through many obstacles, such as fighting a huge snake to trying to find Martin the Warrior's sword. Matthias gets help from many friends such as a badger and shrews and all types of animals. I would recommend this book to everyone."
3,required school report,"synopsis: this book is about a mouse named Mathias who strives to become the successor to Redwall Abby's warrior mouse Martin. What i liked about the book was how Mathias went from a common mouse to a warrior mouse. Mathias goes from doing everyday things to manipulating birds and controlling a guerilla force of shrews. What i did not like about this book was that the author had a lack of description of size. In the book, mice work with badgers and squirrels, who obviously aren't the same size in real life. This book does have a message, and i think it is that if you stick to your goals in life, you won't ever be dissapointed. This is important because everyone should have a goal in life. I would recommend this book to anyone who likesfantasy novels."
4,pretty good book,"This book is a pretty good book. It has great detail and description but kinda gets old and boring after a while. Picture the three musketeers as mice or other small creatures, adn you've got redwall. The same swashbuckling tales, the same plot of some evil animal taking power and somehow interfering with the peaceful creatures of Redwall, the same glorious victory at the end. If you like books that just throws stuff at you out of the blue, say an attack form some tribe or whatever, then you'll like the Redwall series. The seventeenth book just came out but Brian Jacques (the author) is still making more."
5,Looks can be Decieving,"Last year my friend started reading a book called Redwall, and she told me it was the best book she had ever read. I didn't care much for the cover, besides being a very dog-eared old library book it showed a mouse standing on a wall and holding a sword, with a crowd of big ugly rats down below. I was also very disappointed in the book itself. How can you write a four-hundred page book on a group of talking mice and their peaceful but boring lives? I was amazed that they could find so many compliments to put on the back cover. But this year, when I found it on a cart in the library I tried reading it again and I finally got hooked, when I read about Cluny the Scourge's plans for capturing Redwall Abbey, the kingdom of the sparrows, the riddle of Martin the Warrior, and the dreaded snake, Asmodeuss. Now I am looking for the second Redwall book, and I hope it will be as good as the first. I recommend this book to anybody who likes animals and fantasy!"
5,Redwall is the best Book Ever!,"Hi I'm 14 years old actually but I couldn't use the adult form. I wanted to tell everyone under 13 to read this book. It has action, adventure, horror(well maybe not horror)comedy and love. It's a beautiful story and I urge you to read it. I personaly love Matthias. He kind of has the same attitude like me. Always standing up for waht you believe in. Matthias, Cornflower, Constance and Basil Stag Hare are my favorite characters. They're funny, entertaining and its easy just to fall right into their world with them as the ""stars"" of the book. Mr. Brian Jacques is a magnificent author. I think that his book, Redwall, beat Harry Potter 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7, and 5,6, and 7 aren't even out yet. When I read this book for the first time at the end it brought a tear to my eye when. . . Well if you want to know why it brought a tear to my eye, Read This Book! Then try reading all 14!!"
5,This is the best book in the world!!!!!!,"This book is great.It is my all time favorite book.Also I bet that if you read it you will like it alot,even though it might not be your favorite book.It's about a rat named Cluny who wants to take over a building called Redwall Abbey.But even though the creatures are peaceful and have not seen action in years,they're determined to kill Cluny and the gang.Some characters that fight in the battle is Mattias(the main character),a team of shrews,some sparrows,the creatures of Redwall and Mossflower(the name of forest),and also the spirit of Martin the Warrior.If you're a fantasy lover you're got to love this book,if you read it, and me personally recommend it that you should.There are I think 11 books in the series and I hope Brian Jacques writes more.Read this book."
4,Delightful!,"Jacques world of mice, foxes, shrews, rats and other woodland creatures is both a delightful and scary place to visit. I was surprised by the twists he worked into the plot. The action is so vividly described I could almost see it happen before me.If you buy this book be warned: it may be a very hard book to put down!"
5,Thrilling Book!,"This is probably my favorite fantasy book!! And let me tell you, i have read a ton of fantasy books! I loved the little charactars and all of their interesting names. A big part i really liked in this book were all of the riddles. Once you found the answer, it would suddenly click, and you would think, ""why didn't i figure that out?"" Anyway, i absoloutley loved this book, it was so mysterious and adventurous!! This is a book i HIGHLY reccomend to all fantasy lovers!!!!!!!!"
5,Great Book!,"I really liked this book. At first I wasnt sure how a book with a mouse wearing a dress carrying a shield could be good, but I kept on reading and really loved it. It's one of the best books I ever read aside from Harry Potter."
4,Awesome gate way/ adventure book,"AH! Redwall were to begin? if you are an adventure fiction lover you will like Redwall this is an awesome gateway book that will get you reading all of Brian Jacques's bok's. It is a wonderful series and if u liked this one you will like mattimeo , salmandastrom and martin the warrior. I truly recomend this book to all young adult readers in the world and i hope you enjoy it.Jacques is an awesome writer his books are enriched with details and awesome edge of ur bed reading adventures."
5,Redwaalllllllllll,"This,by far,is one of the best books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book,especially if you like adventure. I also recommend Mossflower, Mariel of Redwall, Mattimeo, and Salamandastron."
2,"Okay for kids, but...","This book tries too hard to be _Watership Down_ and doesn't succeed. It might be entertaining for young readers, but this was on the adult fantasy shelves at my bookstore and I picked it up hoping to be enchanted. Unfortunately, unlike _Watership_, the characters are way too one-dimensional, which makes _Redwall_ rather unsatisfying.I might have liked this book better had I not read it right on the heels of _Watership_, or had I read it when I was younger. However, this, unlike the Chronicles of Narnia and other classics, is a book that doesn't satisfy adults as well as children."
4,The Great,I thought that Redwall was one of the best books I've read. The action in the book was amazing and every paged surprised me. The best part of reading it was that our teacher brought the tape and our class listened to it. The tape really adds a touch. The tape brings out the voice in the character. Listening to the tape also brings the characters alive.
3,Read it to the kids,"O.K., since I would probably get flamed for this review, I left off my e-mail address. Since this is one of most praised books of late, I purchased it. After reading it, my thought is this: if I had bought this book to read to my kids, I and they would have loved it. Little animals rising up against the evil rats and serpents. It is humorous and well written. However, I found it juvinile. All right you are saying, buy a book with a mouse as the hero, what do you inspect? Well, I guess I was expecting ""Watership Down"" which is really deep, moving book, filled with symbolism and lessons on life. ""Redwall"" is not like that. It is heroic fantasy with a mouse cast as Bilbo Baggins. Disney meets Tolkien?"
3,whats up,this book was fun to read. Although it wasnt my favorite of the series it was good. i didnt like how he described the shrews. it was like they were a different tribe. read this book after you have read some others.
3,Extremely violent for a children's book.,"By far the most violent children's book I've ever seen. In the course of this book, several animals are eaten by a snake, dozens are burned to death, more are boiled to death, several fall from great heights to their death, some are crushed under giant weights, others are stabbed, shot with arrows, or thrown into a tree. The violence is not restricted to the ""bad"" animals, as some of the most likeable protaganists suffer brutal and painful deaths. In short, it is inappropriate at best for many younger children."
2,"Disappointing, and a Sore Inconvenience","I ordered this product for a present for someone, under the impression that it was used, like new. The description clearly indicated that it was in prime condition. However, the jacket is badly wrinkled, the pages are discolored and marked, there are 'Houston Public Library' tags on the cover, a bold 'DISCARD' stamped on the inside, and even a card slot on the inside. None of these blemishes were described by the advertisement. I obviously cannot give this as a gift to someone, and now I am precariously caught precisely a week before Christmas, with no book to give to this person, thanks to the very dishonest description of the book. I want my money back."
2,Doesn't live up to its billing,"I wasn't impressed. I Love a good fantasy, regardless of intended agegroup, but this wasn't it. Too predictable, contrived, melodramatic, and cloyingly saccharine sweet for adults; too full of blood, death, and violence for children, Redwall seems to have aimed at the hazy middle and missed. Jacques seems never to have met adjective he could resist, or a cliché best left out. And let's not even mention character development. I had to force myself to finish the book. (...)"
5,Ode to Redwall,A place safe from harmLoving caring homeFriends all around youCareSiege comes and never diesPlans and plansNever to succeedThe blossom bloomingThe love and care is backNever to leave againI am that isGuardedBy devotion not hateI am that isCome and see the evilNever to see againDeath is not apparentNewRebornlovedNever to see evil againWithI am that is
4,Beware,"Redwall is a great story about animals trying to defend themselves from the evil ones, but I would be careful who I recommend it to. I enjoyed most of it, with the exception of some of the rough scenes wherein someone dies or is tortured. The author doesn't make a great deal of it, yet they are descriptive and perhaps too much for younger readers, or listeners... an adult can handle it fine.Anna del C.Author of ""The Elf and the Princess""The Elf and The Princess: The Silent Warrior Trilogy - Book One (The Silent Warrior Trilogy)"
5,Simply Amazing,"This is a wonderful book, if you like fantasy or you just love a beautiful piece of literature you should read it. I was referred to it by a lady at school and when I first picked it up it was reminiscent of ""The Secret of Nimh"" (not sure how to spell the last word, it's been awhile) which I had read as a young child and loved. It was even better! Longer, better written, well crafted characters (no Charles Darnay but he writes well, so they're very compelling), and then a plot I took a liking too. Who would have guessed it was part of a series, which I read in about a year. The whole series is great, but read them in order, either chronologically or when they were written. This probably wasn't the best in the series (I highly reccomend Legend of Luke and Mossflower too) but it's still beautiful. Brian Jacques has beautiful writing, just see for yourself."
5,Good and Evil Clash in Epic Battle,"Young Matthias, an excepted orphan of Redwall, is on a quest to find the soward of Martin the Worrior. Back home the mice of Redwall and other creatures are fighting a battle aginst Cluny the Scrouge, and his horde of warriors."
5,Redwall,I really enjoyed this book. It was full of suspence and adventure. Some times when I reading it I could not put it down. This was the first book that I read in the redwall series. Sometimes funny sometimes sad and others just full of mystery. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy and high adventure.
5,As a 46-year-old reader,"to my preteen sons -- we have read many sophisticated books, and absolutely loved Redwall. Just wanted to say that Harry Potter has nothing on these animals -- he was predictable, they never were. And the variety and complexity of personalities and plot twists! A thoroughly enjoyable experience all around, and we can't wait to read more of them."
1,A horrible book,I thought that this was a bad book because i think it was very boring and it only made sense towards the end. So that book was the worst book that I have ever read in my life. I think it kept saying the same thing over and over. There was one good part in that book it was the last page when the action finally got started. So I would not recommend this book unless you like mice killing books.
1,The worst book I've ever read.,"This book was TERRIBLE, and I hated it. I found nothing good, and everything bad, about this stupid book. I would not recommend it. END"
2,"Formula, formula, formula","My favorite parts of the Redwall books are the descriptions of the food. I think that kind of says something about the actual story.After reading several Redwall books, you come to realize that......they're all the SAME. Different details, yes, but the plot structure never changes. To sum it up: They have a feast. There's bad news of an oddly-named vermin leader come to invade/pillage/destroy/conquer something. Someone goes haring off on an adventure. The vermin are defeated and the leader killed. They all go back to Redwall for a feast. The end.On the other hand, I really liked these books in middle school."
3,Formulaic is an understatment,"The problem isn't with Redwall (which is, in my opinion, a great book during middle school), but with all the sequals. Read Redwall, then never anything by this guy ever again. I did, and it got to the point were the books felt identical, it was so boring I couldn't bring myself to read them. It seemed as if Jaques sacrificed what could have been a decent series for a $#!* load of clones."
3,Not the greatest...,"I like this series a lot, but this one was not the best. It lacked certain qualities, such as good charector development, and it had little plot. Also I think the auther killed off to many charectors. Though it was a defanate good read, it wasn't the greatest."
3,"Jacques needs to write TO the audience, not AS the audience.","However good the story might be (and it's not, terribly...fairly cliched, unoriginal, and shows a shocking misuse of historical terminology--perhaps he did his research from ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Medieval History""?, the book is written quite poorly. Jacques makes the same mistakes that beginning writers do: massive exposition through dialogue, breaking the 'show, don't tell' rule; cliched characters that are poorly introduced, with bad humor. As a 9-12 year old, I wouldn't even have wasted my time with this--read Narnia, or Xanth, or Eddings. Any of them are better-written. On the other hand, the cover is nice...how does that old saying go?"
4,my son couldn't put the book down,"I ordered a copy of the book off of Amazon for my son, who is eleven, and I think he just finished the third book in the series. He filled me in on the details exhaustively, like an oral book report, and I have to say it kept him engaged and entertained. He is likely to read his way through the entire series.Paul Buckner,Author of ""Gabriel Jennings and the Ferret Freedom Fighters."""
5,The Greatest Book,"The Book, ""Redwall,"" is one of the greatest books ever written. It is written with descriptions that paint a picture better than paint ever could in your head. In it, the villians are always treacherously bad, and the good guys will fight to the death for the right way, and there are never any complications over who is who. It includes a dazzling story line, that will keep you on the edge of your seat in the one session that it will take you to read it."
4,High Average Book,"This book started out strong, but got boring in the middle. I recomend Salamandastron, Bellmaker, or MArtin the Warrior. (also in the redwall series)"
5,Interesting,"My husband really enjoyed getting this book. He loves all books by this author, partially because they're related. We enjoy getting the hardcover editions for keepsakes. This book is also very interesting to read."
5,Maximum power and drive,"I don't have this title on CD, but I found it ""again"" in my vinyl collection. It is one of the best live recordings of rythm and blues (not R&B! ) I ever heard. Full of power, emotion, heavenly swinging band and with a lot of saxofone of cause. If you like this kind of music (Springsteen, Bob Seger and so on) BUY THIS RECORDING ! You won't regret it."
5,Just Plain Good!,"This cd is wonderful. Amel's voice is absolutley stunning. I mean incredible! It is so angelic and beautiful. The song ""Make me Whole"" has to be one of the most beautiful ballads I've ever herd. ""Down"", ""Even if"", ""Weather"", and ""I n I"" are also all standout tracks. However the entire cd is amazing so cop it! Yuo will not be dissapointed."
4,Amel takes u to anither place with this...listen and see!,"This cd from Amel reminds you of groove theory in some ways but makes a sounds of her own at the same time. She did good for her first cd and looks nothing like when she was with groove theory. I heard this over at a friends and at first I thought it was sade, then when I heard the song ""Get up"" I knew it was her. Her voice is low and smooth and u might say it puts u to sleep but if u really turn it up u hear all the sounds thats mixed in. The lyircs to a lot of these songs are deep and make u wonder if she was in some rough times. A good example is the song..""Get up"". I don't know the whole meaning but I know a part of it is about working everyday and not going past that to find what u really want or enjoy out of life.(Work--home--work--home) Overall this is a good cd and If you enjoy smooth music(like think of a mellower groove theory), then you will like this.Don't Sleep on Amel."
4,This album gets under your skin and puts you in the mood...,"This album qualifies as the only time that buying a CD based on the strength of one song (""Get Up"") did not end in disappointment -- this album is thoroughly beautiful and a real joy to listen to. *Highly* recommended. Every track is an instant favorite -- the soulful beauty of ""Even If"" thrills me every time, and I'm surprised that none of the other reviews have mentioned it (instant classic). This one is completely worth it."
5,Awesome Debut!,"Words cannot explain this recording at all. This happens to be one of the best artistic creations ever recorded on CD. The mellowness of the fender rhodes, and that voice, it's almost like reaching into the heavens and hearing the angels live and in person. Most memorable songs are: ""Get Up"", ""Infinite Possibilities"", ""Weather"", ""Shine"", etc. Listening to this almost sounds like listening to Sade, very smooth and seductive. A must have in your CD collection if you love soothing R&B... Sdeez"
4,Restore Your Faith in Female R&B Performers!,"She's got places to go and things to do and it won't be long! She will be extremely large. If this debut is an indication we have nothing but refreshing and evolving music to look forward to from Amel. I like the lyrical content, her changes, the jazz content mixed in and around the R&B, etc. I don't like to predict where the next note is going and there is some of that for me. If the music were as altogether as imaginative as her lyrics......well, this is her first. I am still giving it four stars based on lyrical content and voice! I have phoned all my friends and relatives to insist that they rush out to get it as well. I am enjoying this cd, particularly ""INI"" and ""The Weather"" and I look forward to growth and the next one. All this and she is fully clothed too!"
4,"This LP is tight, very listenable and surprisingly mature","I was really impressed by this album. I really liked the whole vibe of this album, which draws its influences from house, Sade, hip-hop and jazz. It's paced by subtle changeups in tempo (""down,"" ""i n i"") but maintains a consistent sound. Amel's voice is light and easy on the ear. What surprised me most were the maturity of the lyrics throughout. The standouts on this LP are the bouncy 1st single, ""get up,"" ""i n i,"" and the title track. I'm going to keep my eyes and ears on Amel. With some support, she could go a ways."
5,mind blowing,"every since i heard the single 'get up' i have been anticipating this cd. after listening to the whole cd, i must say that it is mind blowing. it truly was worth the wait. i hope that 'infinite possibilities' will go as far as the talent on the cd deserves to go."
4,Restore Your Faith in Female R&B Performers!,"She's got places to go and things to do! She will be extremely large. If this debut is an indication we have nothing but wonderful music to look forward to from Amel. I like the lyrical content, her changes, the jazz content mixed in and around the R&B, etc. If the music were as altogether as imaginative as her lyrics......well, this is her first. I think I would like to hear guitar along with the other instrumentation to compliment that beautiful voice. The music is a little subdued but hey, I am still giving it four stars! And I have called all my friends and relatives to insist that they rush out to get it as well. I am enjoying this cd and I look forward to growth and the next one. All this and she is fully clothed too!"
4,Amel....Amen!!!!!,"Jill Scott? Yeh, who is she anyway? Amel Larrieux is as versatile as they come. She is sultry. She is funky. She scats. She croons. She hips and she hops. She drives and she seduces. The only dog I found was 'i n i' ... coulda left that one at home. get up gets after it. sweet misery...whew. make me whole...beg me. Amel.....amen."
3,Songwriting?,"No-one doubts Amel's voice. She is amazing. But what happened to songwriting? Most of these tracks aren't so much songs as they are 'loops' that seem to go on for ever while Amel scats over them. Please, Amel, enough scatting. Whatever happened to verse, chorus, verse, chorus? I cite ""Searching for My Soul"" and ""Shine"" as examples."
1,DO NOT EXPECT Groove Theory II,"This album is mediocre at best. It seems to draw comparisons to Sade but Sade is Sade and Amel should be Amel. Amel and Bryce were a great team and the tracks that Bryce laid down in Groove Theory's debut with Amel's voice were phenomenal. Bryce's beats are sorely missed in Amel's solo effort. I was hoping for a reunion for at least a track or two but no luck. So don't make the same mistake I did and expect Groove Theory II. Amel's voice is indeed a beautiful one but the lack of musical direction is a fatal flaw. The music is just a meandering flow from one track to the other; not one standout track on here. Groove Theory was/is one of my favorite CD's and this one doesn't compare. I know this is Amel's CD and not Groove Theory but I expected so much more. You won't be bobbin' yo' head to this one, so if that's what your lookin' for pick up Amel's first effort, ""Groove Theory,"" if you don't already have it."
1,very Predictable,there's nothing new that hasn't been done already.the beats have been done before a thousand times.this disc is 2nd rate Badu&Bliege.Amel has a good voice but this Material is Lacking anything New.
3,Good but definitely not great,"Amel has a pleasant melodious singing style, her songs are pretty, but definitely lack an edge. I bought this cd because of the other reviews, I'm sorry but I can't share in the excitement. Infinite Possibilities is a good cd, but it is way too average to be considered great."
4,Supreme Quality,"My wife and I saw Amel perform live at the Essence festival in New Orleans this summer, her performance was superb she had the ability to mimc the sounds of a flute, drums and other instruments,and sustain her soft soultry voice, with extradinary ranges. Every since we've seen her we have been fans. She reminds me of Sade and Ella rolled in one sexy women"
4,The return of Amel Larrieux,"The Groove Theory album has been one of my all-time favorites, so quite naturally I anticipated this album. Amel did not disappoint. She is an incredible vocalist and very underrated as well. I-N-I was the first song that I heard from the album and for me, it was an indication of what to expect from Amel. My favorites are:Get Up, I-N-I, Even If, Down, Weather, and Makes Me Whole. The album could have been longer, but it is quality not quantity that matters most. This album has quality!"
5,One of the BEST CD's of 2000,"When I first heard ""Get up"" by Amel, I knew that that the CD was a must have. It has such a positive new vibe to it and it did not fall into the category of most today's music where every song sounds like something else you just heard. The only difference is that someone else is singing. If you're considering Amel's CD, I promise you will not be disappointed."
4,"Let it grow on you, reap its results...","Amel truly has distanced herself from her gloried Groove Theory past and ripened into a stellar vocalist. Infinite Possibilities serves as a distinguishable and mellifluous debut from beginning 'til end. It dabbles through musical genres and textures with care and delicacy. You can hear Amel's maturity resonate through the album on songs such as the inspirational ""I N I,"" the celestial tinkling of ""Makes Me Whole,"" the bluesy feel of ""Even If,"" the enlightened vibe of ""Get Up"" and the post-modern jazz flow of ""Infinite Possibilities."" Overall, Infinite Possibilites lives up to its namesake. The sound on the album is earthy, jazzy, mellow R&B, with a slight tinge of hip hop. It's unfair to compare this album to Groove Theory; that was years ago and Amel is now her own artist with her own visions."
4,Incredible Voice Control & Talent,"This young woman is definitely an unappreciated treasure. At first, her songs took time to grow on me, but that was only because it is so different from what the music industry generally has to offer. I experianced the same effect with Sade & her music. After a while one song would become my favorite, & then another, until after a short while the entire album was my favorite. I think part of it has to do with what type of mood you are in & what you are experiancing in your life, because sometimes the words & music seem to be touching the deepest parts of you soul. There is a quality to her voice that just wants to take down that protective barrier we all have, & just cry - whether for sorrow or joy."
4,Not a bad CD,"I really only bought this CD for the song ""Make me Whole"" but the whole CD in itself isn't bad at all! I am very glad that I bought it, and I listen to it quite frequently!"
5,There is a new sound in the house- Amel Larrieux,"Infinite Possibilities is one of the best albums I have ever heard. Amel's pensive lyrics are pure poetry and her beats and beautiful voice captivate any listener. When I play the CD in my dorm, students of all different backgrounds and tastes in music always say how hot it is. The song ""weather,"" is one of my favorites- her daughter opens up the song and her young voice brings a whole new light to the album. If you like Ella or Badu, Zap Mama, Jewl or Sade you would love this album. Check it out and do your soul a favor..."
1,taxi korean import,I was very dissapointed it was like i wasted my money. I bought it because i wanted to see marion cotillard at her best beautiful body
3,Frenzied silliness in Fiordland,"A deer hunter(Wahl)and his bumbling partner(Pleasance) by chancestumble upon the wreckage of a DC-3 on the shore of LakeWakatipu. Included amongst its cargo are medals, booze, money and$50 million in gold bullion. Before they can begin recovery,others get wind of the discovery and show up to pressure them inrevealing the location. This is an action/chase, frankly silly,film with most of its energy occurring in the numerous stunts,chases and explosions. I'll bet that George Peppard does not put this oneon his resume. Great helicopter shots of Fiordland and the Queenstownarea are the main reasons for seeing this one. VHS copies are NOT widescreen.The DVD has no extras, but it is presented in the original 2.35:1 Cinemascope widescreen."
1,Not typical Kevn,This album is not typical Kevn Kinney. Even if you have been a huge fan for years (as I have) you'll find little on this album that you will enjoy. Save a couple bucks and let this one sit on the shelf.
5,great version of a classic tale,"Even though this is an old production now, and of course the ""script"" is several hundred years old, I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD."
1,Somebody warn Branagh about this!,"The visuals of the film and VHS were brilliant on screen, even with candle-lit scenery; a cinematographer's masterpiece! But the same scenes on this low-budget transferrence are murky at best and a pain to the eyes at worst. Digital technology shouldn't make me squint."
2,"Brilliant Film, Terrible DVD","Perhaps I am one of the few, the unhappy few, who loves this movie and got a dvd in which the sound is frequently out of sync with the movement of the actors' mouths.It kind of kills the momentum of a film dependent upon Shakespearean dialogue to have a glitch that puts one in mind of ""Singin' in the Rain."""
4,Excellent performances all around,"I'm not as familiar with Henry V as I ought to be (Richard III is more my taste) but the acting and scenery employed in this film makes the story of Henry's ill-conceived French campaign come to life, although it hardly seems to do the Battle of Agincourt justice. The actors employed for this movie truly do the words of Shakespeare justice and even if you can't always follow exactly what is going on in the dialogue you can still understand the bigger issues being discussed in the story. Overall, very good and eminently enjoyable."
4,On Your Imarginary Forces Work,"Branagh's epic deserves 5 stars but i substracted one because the DVD contains no special features... which really is inexcusable.Olivier's version to present Henry V as a play within a play is wonderfully subtle at times and works on several levels... but the gritty atmosphere of Branagh's version is immediate and gives a stronger suspension of belief.Branagh is at his best in this film and most dynamic, from Henry's low menacing rebuke of the Dauphin's 'treasure', to the fierce assault on those poor half-Fleurs, to the incredible speech to his troops on fields of Agincourt.the entire cast is superb but casting Jacobi as the Chorus is sheer genius. he completely set the tone for the film and watching the film, it's hard to imagine anyone else who could be a better to link between the viewer with the play.this is an exceptional film that really deserves a place in any movie collection."
2,"HenryV was a ""no show"".",The version of HenryV I received was unplayable on both my Blu-ray and my standard DVD player. The disk looks to be in excellent condition and is brand new. I'm stumped. Anyone got an answer?
2,WRONG REGION,"The DVD was shipped promptly and in excellent condition BUT when I tried to play it the error message ""Not suitable for this region"" appeared on the screen. When I looked at the cover I saw that it was for distribution in USA and Canada only (Region 1). As it was shipped to me in Australia I expected that a version that was suitable for Australia would have been sent. So now I have a useless copy of Henry V."
1,Would subtitles in *English* be too much to ask for?,"I am so angry I am ready to *strangle* whoever produced this DVD!This is, without a doubt, the finest ""Henry V"" ever made. Superb acting, sound, direction, script... I could go on for an hour.And then some dweeb produces the album with Subtitles in French, and Spanish, but *NOT* English!Don't bother with this one and protest this travesty to the studio!"
4,"Five stars for the film, minus one for the DVD","Next to Oliver, Branagh may very well be the only person of the modern era to TRULY undertsand what shakespeare was trying to express when he wrote his plays.This version of Hank-5 (we close friends get to call him Hank) is flawless in its delivery and beautiful in its form. This is a must see film and especially for those who don't think they like shakespeare.Branagh's delivery of the St. Crispin's day speech is nothing short of breath-taking (and the first version I have seen where the actor, appropriately, smiles during the recitation)... most surprising is the 'I was not angry since I came from England' dialogue and Branagh angrily assaults the french herald...amazing performances all around, Brian Blessed, Derek Jacobi (as the Chorus in his trench-coat) and Branagh himself... all amazing..."
3,NO closed-captioning option in ENGLISH!,"This *HENRY V* DVD lacks both English closed-captioning -OR- subtitles as a menu option, yet they are offered in French & Spanish! -- Therefore, we whom are disabled by being hard-of-hearing, completely deaf, and others who MUST rely on DVDs or VHS-tapes to *ALWAYS* contain an English-language closed-captioning or a subtitle option: this DVD was a VERY BITTER purchasing disappointment. Moreover, here's yet another *MGM Studio* DVD release -- that's completely lacking any kind of English closed-captioning or subtitles option! ****CAVIAT EMPTOR!******"
5,The Finest Shakespeare to date on film,"Mr. Branagh was in his twenties when he put this movie together,a blessing and a curse. The blessing in that it is a brilliant{the soundtrack is excellent],the curse, of course is the same that Orson Wells expierenced . Can He do it again?Shakespeare's henry is come a distance in this film from the fun loving Hal of henry the 4th, parts one and two. The movei opens with the insult form the French monarch,then proceed from there. Spies,subtefuge,vicious battle scenes, political intrigue and,all of it wrapped in as sweet poetry as the west has yet produced. The performances are uniformly excellent {though just seeing the great Paul Scofield is a pleasure}Heretical as it sounds, I never found Olivier's shakepeare to be anything extraordinary,and his Henry V looks silly in comparison.Branagh has never again touched the stars with his work{though moments of his Hamlet were sublime] .Little matter. This is fine, perhaps a classic,just short of a masterpiece."
5,Fabulous!,"Excellent presentation of Henry V! Kenneth Brannaugh really got it right! Gets the viewer involved with what is happening in the story right away with the close-up shots, and voicing of the character's thoughts. The British acting is, of course, fantastic; and the costuming and dialogue very authentic to the period. From what I know of historic battles, the battle scenes appeared authentic - dirty, rough, with hand-to-hand combat. I became very attached to several of the characters, and dispised some of the others (a sign of good directing!) Highly recommended, especially to Anglophiles!"
3,No English Subtitles,"This is a Shakespearean movie spoken largely in whispers - which does NOT have English subtitles. The only subtitles are French and Spanish. It is beautifully filmed and appears to be very well-acted, but if you're the least bit hard of hearing, you're out of luck when it comes to the dialogue! I find it incredibly hard to believe that English subtitles were not included. In these modern times, the language of Shakespeare is almost foreign."
5,Best Movie Ever,This movie is one of the best ever made. The story is one of Shakespere's few up-beat plots. Kenneth Brannagh plays Henry masterfully and the whole cast is a pleasure to watch. The fnal battle with france is superbly done and heart-wrenching. Love this film.
5,Exhilirating,"It is rare for film to bring history and story alive. However, HENRY V achieves that!HENRY V is used in the study of Shakespeare, business schools on leadership, and in history courses to cover the British victory in the famous Battle of Agincourt.The film is breathtaking. It is extraordinary."
2,Disappointing!,"This work is a strange hybrid between a filmed theatrical performance and a full-fledged movie production. Many scenes are just static and stage-like. Others, the battle for instance, are shot outdoors with horses, mud and an obvious desire for realism. This is awkward as the play's prologue calls for the spectator's imagination and points out specifically that open fields cannot be reproduced as such in a play.Worse, both Branagh and Thompson clearly look much too old for their roles. Despite their talent, they are consequently both unconvincing. In particular, Thompson's French is excellent but there is no way that she can pass for a native speaker as her part calls for.Not devoid of interest, this DVD is recommended only to those curious of yet another interpretation of this Shakespearean play."
3,demands way too much,"If you're going to bring together a first rate cast to do a film of a relatively obscure Shakespeare play, why not spend some money and make a beautiful film that recreates the time and place. This looks like it was done on an extremely tight budget. And so the scope of the story is mostly left to the imagination. And this requires that one knows the story very well. I don't and few do. Also problematic is the fact that Brannagh's speechifying seems intent on the music of the words without care for their understanding. The voice goes up and the voice goes down. Emphasize THIS and then emphasize THAT. His whole approach seems quite artificial. If you want to see a Shakespeare film that works on every level a much better choice would be Mel Gibson's Hamlet. More than anything else, this Henry V seems little more than a war of words."
4,A truely mind-shattering experience!,"I have to be truthful and say that I would never have bought this CD as I had heard through people that this music was very depressing. But after actually hearing it played by a workmate I was hooked! I have been totally enthralled by this CD since I bought it. I have had the CD for one day now and have played it around 5 times through. This mans voice is unbelievable and I agree with other reviewers notes on how he sounds like an angel. His singing range is so diverse it is truely beautiful, the different emotions are just so complex. I just love Last Goodbye and Eternal Life. Last Goodbye had me in tears- it really moved me. No song has ever done that to me before, WOW it was mind-shattering. I will be playing this CD for years to come. I know I have been introduced to the great sounds of Jeff Buckley later than most but better late than never."
5,Haunting and Transcendant,"I wonder, do I actually get stars in my eyes when I listen to this album? It truly feels that way. Chills down the spine, tears, joy, laughter... It is uncanny that he said he wrote for the people driving down the road with the stereo blaring, crying, and singing at the top of their lungs, because that is exactly what I often do while listening to Grace. As an artist, every painting I make is created to the soundtrack of Jeff Buckley, for the reason that it completely removes me from the physical world. Beyond being my favorite album ever, it truly changed me. It means so much to hear other devotees say the same. Jeff was/is someone who sings to the deepest part of your soul, and doesn't let you go until you're completely exhausted. Thank you, thank you, thank you Jeff..."
5,THE MASTER,"Grace is an excellent piece of work, almost every song is a favorite of mine. Jeff has a very haunting voice, one that will never leave your soul once you hear it."
5,"Sweet, yet sexy, strong, but soft, simply divine","Grace is the most incredibly beautiful album that I have ever heard. His voice suits so many different types of songs. Eternal Life is hard and fast whilst Lilac Wine and Hallelujah are pure and sweet. Not only could he sing, he could write also. Last Goodbye cannot be described in words. All I can say is listen. Hear him. You will love it. The most heartrending part of the album is of course the last line of Dream Brother. ""Asleep in the sand, with the ocean washing over me"" Jeff Buckley drowned a little over a year ago, having sung his own epitaph. Listen to it."
2,over-rated,"This doesn't even come close to being one of the best albums ever. Ok, i admit that the title track is great, but come onnnn. The rest of it ranges from boring to outright irritating."
4,Hatchet Job Hallelujah,"The solemn and elegiacal power of Leonard Cohen's beautiful ""Hallelujah"" is completely subverted by Jeff Buckley. It is painful and somehow embarrassing to hear. Even if you do not care for Cohen generally his own rendition is superior to Buckley's pointless and insipid cover. Honors must go to John Cale who in addition to bringing the requisite solidity and subtle strength to this song also carries the tune with just the right passion. The only good song on this album is Corpus Christi Carol but it never made the album worth keeping.P.S. Jan 2011. I orginally gave this album one star but have since revisted it and...eureka, I like it just fine. Cale and his stentorian pipes however, will always make him the high priest of Hallelujah."
2,Hate to be a naysayer,"I hate to be a naysayer -- Buckley's voice is gorgeous and he obviously has talent, but his rendition of Leonard Cohen's Halleluja struck me the wrong way; while sung clearly and with talent, Buckley's arrangement utterly fails to capture the essence of a truly beautiful song."
1,Boring,"I bought this CD based on the glowing reviews and the one song I knew I liked - ""Hallelujah"". I don't usually write reviews but felt compelled in this case because I hated everything else on this CD. Save your money and buy just ""Hallelujah"" if you are buying this for that song. Don't expect the other songs to be anywhere near as good as ""Hallelujah"". Don't be swayed by all the 5 star reviews. I was, and I regret it."
5,"Spiritual, Sensual and Transporting","How you like this album will depend on how sexual you like your religion. It is a soaring and artistically thoughtful, genuine and orginal album that will literally transport you to places both sacred and deeply, profoundly carnal. Jeff Buckely's voice plunges and soars, revealing a true virtuoso. He sweeps you in--so much of his music conveys tidal ebbs, flows, and helplessness against nature that makes it all the more eerie considering his tragic death. It is a beautiful album that is never, ever predictable, but purely, completely lovely and deep."
2,He's...,nothing compared to his father... listen to starsailor and lorca if you are really into music...
3,Whiffs of potential,"I am sorry that Jeff Buckley's life was tragically cut short, as he obviously inspired many people with his music. However, I fear I am not one of those people; the stuff is simply too cloying. His celebrated renditions of ""Hallelujah"" and Benjamin Britten's Corpus Christi Carol are meant to be tastefully eerie, as we hear a gentle guitar and the haunted falsetto of the singer. It comes close, but something about it just rubs me wrong; it's all too close-miked, too fey, too unintentionally pompous. His voice reminds me of an elf. I do wish Jeff had lived on because he obviously had talent and potential, but I'm afraid what we have here is an album of wispy warbling that falls shy where it is meant to be profound. If the stuff really moves you, then go ahead and get it, but just because Jeff sounds rather different from other performers you may know - and I am glad he does - just because he sounds different doesn't necessarily mean he sounds great."
2,I don't get it.,I had heard so many positive and glowing reviews I thought I would love it. I can't get past the first three tracks before I have to turn it off. It seems like a droning unpenatrable mess to me.
2,Different,"I find his voice irritating, the mood down, and not a single song that I could tap my toes to, sing along, or an irresistible hook. He verbly wailes a lot, and the tempo is odd. I tried to like this CD, but I just couldn't. ""Hallelujah"" is good, but that is it."
2,Overdone,"Gratuitous and specious are words that come to mind while parsing this album. The only worthwhile song was written by L. Cohen (Hallelujah), and Buckley did an excellent job with it. The rest were written by Buckley, and are regrettable."
2,OVERHYPED,"I find this guy's voice extremely unappealing. He sounds like he can't control it. Sometimes his voice sounds good, but then it goes weak. I'm amazed that so many people love it. This album is borderline pretentious and I just don't think the songs are very good. But some of the more atmospheric stuff sounds kinda cool, especially on the last song.P.S. - the guy's review below me is laughable. Buckley doesn't hit any ""magic frequencies"" - how pretentious! He can't hold a candle to NFAK either."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"When I bought this CD, the only song I'd ever heard Buckley sing was ""Hallelujah."" Naturally, I was enthralled by Buckley's incredibly expressive falsetto--he really does make that track a religious experience. What I was not prepared for was the application of that same technique to every song Buckley sang. When I first listened to this CD, I felt like his rendition of ""Hallelujah"" was cheapened: he hadn't adapted his voice to the demands of that particular song, but simply poured his old formula into a particularly suitable mould. I don't mean to disrespect a late legend, but Buckley's impressive voice quickly loses its luster because of his disappointing lack of versatility."
5,Hallelujah,"Amazing music from an artist gone too soon. Hallelujah is one of the most covered songs--because it's awesome. Jeff Buckley gives us the original, as well as other great songs like Mojo Pin and So Real, songs that give me chills they're so good."
5,This album should get 10 stars!!!,"What can you say about Jeff Buckley? Well, how about that he was the greatest loss to music since John Lennon was killed!He has the ability to take your soul to places only God himself should beable to speak of. Hopefully, we'll all hear the whispered words that this artist spoke of without effort. Jeff, wherever you are, I'm forever in your debt.If you only buy one record this year, make sure it's Grace!!!The world lost a singer that no other can ever replace!This recording touches lives!"
4,Like a second breath of fresh air.,"Current music has been sailing through a creative doldrums these past few years. The resurgence of c_ck rock and prefabricated pop acts had left me high and dry so I went through my old records and rediscovered Jeff Buckley's ""Grace"".I popped it in the cd player and immediately cued the title track. It was familiar yet it was refreshing to hear such a voice and a melody so alien to the ears. No 1-4-5 chord progessions, no cliched blues licks, no guy trying to sound like Eddie Vedder... I listened to the rest of the album. The haunting ""Hallelujah"" that Cohen himself couldn't hold a candle to still gives me shivers. I still knew all the words but I didn't dare sing along. It's a cardinal sin for a man to sing like that. But in this case Buckley is forgiven. ""Last Goodbye"" now carries with it a tinge of irony...It's such a waste. The whole experience just makes you want to think: WHY DIDN'T GOD TAKE SCOTT STAPP INSTEAD?"
5,Grateful for Grace,"It's depressing to discover such beautiful music when you know that's all there will ever be. But I'm grateful for this little piece. So little music actually inspires anymore. You can't say that about Jeff Buckley. Listening to him, it makes you want to play, to write, to create. I think the highest complement to a true music artist is to be called ""inspirational."" I would also recommend the band ""Ours"" to Jeff fans. They are another inspirational group with a phenominal singer with an angelic voice, and a chance to fill that void in our hearts."
4,angelic,"I love the soft angelic quality of jeff's voice. It's uncommon and soul felt. Unlikened, really, to anyone, as far as I'm concerned. He was a pioneer on his own path. Sexy, seductive, insightful...................."
5,Amazing,"Jeff Buckley has created here a masterpiece to stand out among American music for decades. His raw, emotional music combined with his hauntingly beautiful voice draws in the listener and captivates him/her for the entire album. Last Goodbye, Halleluah, and Lover Should've Come Over are three of my all time favorite songs. I highly recommend this album to anyone who can appreciate truly amazing music."
3,Still puzzled,"Folks, I just don't get it. I tried. I even bought a second copy a couple of years after selling my first one, thinking perhaps I had mis-judged this ""great work of art"" and would enjoy it more with a more open mind. But the second time around wasn't any more impressive. I'll buy into the ""remarkable voice"" aspect of Jeff Buckley, or at least the fact that he sings with passion. But the bottom line for me is the material here: the songs are just not that great. Some decent material, but what's to rave about? I feel bad that Jeff passed away so soon. He seemed capable of producing some great music in the future. But honestly, to my ears this album is just not the classic that so many people feel it is. To each his/her own, I guess."
5,voice of an angel,I bought this from moviemars used .I have no complaints it was in excellent condition .Best version of Hallelujah I have ever heard .
5,Heavenly Grace,If you are the kind of person who goes out and buys an album simply because it has one good song on it this album is not for you. This album is for somebody who has the ability to appreciate an entire album. Grace is from start to finish an extremely wonderful listening experience.
5,astonishing!!!,"this may not be some hugely detailed review, far from it, but there's no point in me rambling on about the beauty of this album. And this isn't a review thats going to be of any great help to anyone either. Put simply, buy this album, its the greatest EVER made. Just be in awe of the genius of this greatly missed man."
5,A Religious Experience,"I remember when I first heard the song ""Grace"". I was sitting in traffic and I was amazed at how it kept building layer upon musical layer until it nearly overwhelmed you.I had the pleasure of meeting and hanging out with Jeff in London. Afterwards I saw him perform ""Grace"" live. It was amazing. I remember being completely mesmerised. Everything else faded away and I could just see his face and hear the music. I thought at the time. Everyone who sees this guy perform will fall in love with him. He was like an angel.I first listened to the full CD sitting in a darkened Cathedral and I was blown away. His music was a religious experience for me.Buy this CD. It will be a treasured purchase."
2,"Don't believe the hype - 1.5 stars, not 2","I have heard nothing but great reviews for this cd so I got it and I'm highly disappointed. I agree that he has good lyrics and is very emotionally expressive but this is music, not spoken word poetry, and melodies count. Unfortunately, his melodies seem to wander all over the place. Go check out Elliott Smith and Aimee Mann for great contemorary examples of songwriters who are literate and melodic.Buckley's tortured falsetto voice is difficult to listen to in one sitting. Lacking any real subtlety or restraint it often comes off as whining.As for all those who gave this cd 5 stars, I have to wonder if it's due to the fact that almost no one can write a decent hook, and Jeff Buckley is simply the best of a bland lot.The one highlight of this album is his superb remake of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'. However one song can't redeem the whole cd. Spend your money on Leonard Cohen instead."
3,"Beautiful voice, lackluster album","Upon first listen to this album, I agreed with the overwhelmingly popular sentiment that Jeff Buckley was a voice for the ages, and Grace an album for the decade. After spending several years with Grace, I still hail the voice but no longer the album. While Buckley's falsetto leaves a lasting impression on the ears and perhaps the heart, further listens to the actual music and lyrics on Grace leave less of an impression. Apart from one catchy single (Last Goodbye) and 2 outstanding covers (Lilac Wine, Hallelujiah), Grace is left with several subpar fairly trite alt rock songs.It took years for me to realize it, but Grace simply isnt as great as the voice behind it."
2,Just 2 or 3 songs,Got this cd based on the song Hallelujah and everyone giving it such great reviews. Let me just say I am completely disappointed. I listened to it twice to give it the benefit of the doubt and found there are are only 2 or 3 songs I would ever wanna hear on this album ever again.
5,Always Something New,"I first heard Grace four months ago and have since become a devoted fan. Without a doubt this mans music saved the 90's from bleak grunge and empty pop.Lyrically, I place him with Joni Mitchell, Carol King, McCartney/Lennon. His ability to communicate an idea or emotion with alarming directness and precision is a lost art in todays world of overly wordy pop music. As far as labeling his musical style... you really can't. Few other artists move from hard rock, jazz, soul, punk, 16th century music, and songs with eastern influences as effortlessly and as honestly as he does. You can tell Buckley was a true lover of music in general and appreciative of it's power.If you're new to Buckley's music, this CD is the best place to get your introduction (or Live at Sin-e). It's a very polished recording, but it's sure to spark your interest in his other albums (each more gritty and earthy) Mystery White Boy, and Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk."
5,A MUST HAVE,"Just in the past year have I discovered Jeff, and it makes me almost weep when I realize I will never get to attend a concert of his. What a tremendous talent he was, and if you didn't know, there is a DVD of a live concert of his out there. The more you hear this CD, the more you will love it."
5,just buy it,"Grace has changed lives, its as simple as that. Jeff Buckley bleeds emotion through your speakers and captures the pure essence of rock and roll. While many critics speculate that the popularity of this album centers around the singer's untimely death, it is obvious that the music is what drives a person to own this CD. I made the mistake of not telling my sister that he had died a while back and she couldn't believe that she would never get the opportunity to see this man perform. My only consolation was that we are all in the same boat. All we have left is his music and that will have to do until we join him. ""You never said your last good-bye as you took your swim in the Mississippi."" -GF Buy this album; it is more than just a relic of the man who passed, it is a living, breathing entity which ignites the soul and captivates the heart."
4,Feeling,"My mom was in love with his father's (Tim Buckley) music. Friends of mine recommended that I listen to Jeff Buckley. I fell in love with the song, ""Last Goodbye"", before buying Grace. His amazing voice, his range, the truth in his voice... Grace is a beautiful CD that I could never give up."
5,Is he fabulous? YES.,"I think that this just might be one of the best albums to come out of the 1990s. It is very very true. What makes this man so very special? There is a fairly large range of musical perspectives, and all brought together (when otherwise, wouldn't it all just be really confusing to have an R&B like number, juxtaposed with raging alt. rock?) with his FABULOUS FABULOUS SINGING VOICE! It gives you chills and makes you feel lucky to have gotten your mits on this album. Sigh. So so very special. All the songs are gems. It is too bad he died so very young."
5,B is for Beautiful,"So good, obvioulsy if your reading this you have heard the great tales of his work and yes his music is breath taking it makes me shiverWhy Miss Out!"
5,Greatest album ever recorded,"Jeff Buckley's ""Grace"" is, in fact, the best album ever recorded. It's moving, emotional, authentic, and turned my religion into Jeff Buckley. I've never in my life felt so strongly about an album. Sure, there are plenty of great albums that you can listen to without skipping over a song, and you can listen to them a million times without ever growing tired of them. But none evoke the kinds of feelings that ""Grace"" does. Listening to this album is like being in a perfect, alternate reality where everything is in it's right place, and nothing can go wrong. Not only is Buckley's songwriting at it's absolute best, his vocals are unmatched by anyone, ever. ""Grace"" is, in fact, the best album ever recorded."
5,Jeff Buckley's music is the greatest in the world.,"I bought ""Grace"" 10 months ago. I've never heard anything more beautiful before. It's really magic. It makes me cry and laugh. I first heard and saw Jeff in 1995 on MTV and since then I havent heard anything more beautiful. ""This is our last goodbye...must I dream and always see your face..."""
2,Biggets disappointment and piece of crap.,"I was really disappointed in this album, it was a real piece of crap... I must say. I don't understand why this guy is always compared to Elliott Smith and Nick Drake, they're so much better and so much more inovative. Jeff Buckley... thumbs down."
1,I must be missing something here,"Just wasn't impressed with the music on this CD, a friend had it and I was...forced to listen to it. It just put me in a stupor and didn't do anything to interest me what so ever. I think I was possessed to write this review having had to sit through listening to this CD recently..."
1,boring,"This CD is boring & bland. The CD may be suited to someone elses taste, but it will be in our next garage sale."
1,Boring Pseudo-Hybrid,"It seems like Jeff Buckley attempts to sound like a crossing between Elton John, Gary Moore, Montserrat Caballé and Muse, with a twist of progrock.He does not succeed in any of those attempts.His very little voice - whining and weeping, turning to distorted screaming during the refrains - is only partly compensated by the all but original acoustic guitar play, and only little more by the progrock inspired drums and electric guitars.Therefore, Jeff Buckley is at his best when he doesn't sing.But he does. So...The only OK song on 'Grace' is the final 'Dream Brother'. And still, it is only OK, not exactly brilliant."
1,don't listen to the reviews,"If sickly sweet is your thing then buy this album. But don't listen to me or the others, liusten to at least 3 tracks first. I bought this after listening to the Leonard Cohen cover (hallejuha) which I love but no other track sounds like that one, the rest of the album is sickly sweet and incredibly irritating and nauseating."
5,A little help for skeptics...,"Many people read great reviews about Jeff Buckley and are disappointed. Why? Because Jeff Buckley is different. He was a composer, not just a songwriter. He envisioned and composed every aspect of every song. He was an artist capable of creating great compositions and surprisingly allowed to do so by Columbia Records. Some listeners may have expected something that was more commercial, easier to listen to, something simpler. His melodies are no more meandering than Robert Plant's. It is his vocal style. His music is complex and crafted, not thrown together in 20 minutes at 4am. Jeff Buckley is not for the casual listener, but if you truly appreciate music and the originality of a unique artist that wasn't influenced by a desire to be entirely mainstream and processed. So if you base your CD purchases on MTV's or VH1's top 10 music videos, this CD probably isn't for you."
5,A Great Talent Lost to the World,"It is very sad that the genius of Jeff Buckley is only recently being recognized. Several of his works have been used in recent TV series closing including The West Wing and Without a Trace.To me, the most outstanding tracks on this disk are Halleluiah and Corpus Christie Carol.Besides his sublime voice, his guitar artistry sounded like a harp on Halleluiah. He alluded musically to Beethoven, Handel and Bach. This and the selection of Corpus Christie Carol by Benjamin Britten indicated a very sophisticated genius at work.Some of his selections, or most, seemed oddly prophetic with religeon drawn into many cuts such as; King David in Halleluiah; of course, Grace; The Carol; then, The Last Goodby, Dream Brother; all seemed to indicate he would not be with us very long.Though I treasure this album, it is also unspeakably sorrowful to know that he is gone. I cannot imagine his mother's grief at losing him as she did his father when he was only 27"
5,sheer beauty,"I have always known of JB but a friend of mine recently played this album for me...and i haven't stopped listening to it. ""Lover, you should've come over"" is a perfect song. My heart weeps every time i listen it. Our lives seem so much bleaker without Jeff's beautiful presence."
5,Beauty and agony...,"I don't think that there has ever been an artist that put so much effort into a CD as Jeff Buckley did with ""Grace."" He apparently agonized over the selection of songs and recordings. We're all so very lucky he did. I was introduced to Grace by a lover. While still living my first experience with this wonderful collection of music, I experienced both the euphoria of that love and the agony of betrayal that is expressed in Jeff's music. As much as it hurt, I'm glad Jeff was there with me. It helped to purge my soul of ugliness and to re-introduce beauty. All in one disc made of plastic and metal. Amazing. Thank you, Jeff. We'll all miss you."
1,Is This It?,"Wow..Jeff Buckleys ""Grace"" should be renamed ""Disgrace"".What a stinker this album is.1 star is all this deserves, and that is being awfully generous."
5,Unbelievable voice and talent,i'd heard for years about the amazing vocal range of jeff buckley and how Grace was a truly astonishing album. I was intrigued by this but only finally prompted into buying the album when it rated in the top 50 of an all-time album chart. I wish i'd bought it years ago. It is one of those rare albums that seems to have something for every mood and through all of that you can only marvel at Buckleys voice. It is so sweet and pure and yet he uses it to great effect on difficult subjects which just makes the whole thing sensational. Standout tracks for me are Last Goodbye and So Real. His version of Hallelujah is pretty special too. I'd urge any music lover who has never heard of Jeff Buckley to buy this album now - they won't be disappointed.
2,No Saving Grace,"All I've heard for almost 15 years now is 'Like, oh my God, Jeff Buckley's music is so, like, beautiful...' Well I decided to drink the Kool-aid and buy the CD- I figured, 'Hey, I like tragic rock stars, I like beautiful music when it's done right. I'll give it a shot.' I'm sorry I can't give a review to all the songs because I was always either asleep or had left the room by song six. He's the classic singer without a song- his lyrics are full of the type of mawkish, frat-boy pathos that sorority girls swoon over and anyone with a brain rolls their eyes or cringes at. He's nothing compared to the Cowboy Junkies or Nick Drake or Elliot Smith or Simon or Garfunkel. I only gave it two stars because it is indeed a good cd if you can't fall asleep. Another case of early death making someone into an undeserved legend. Maybe he might have matured into the genuine article but I guess we'll never know."
2,Over rated,"I bought this CD because I heard ""Hallelujah"" on ""The West Wing"" and really loved it. Still do, but the rest of the CD is either so so or noise. For those who think he has an amazing voice, have your hearing checked, as his voice is average at best."
5,great lost talent,"introduced to him about ten years ago and every time I put album on it's like i'm listening to it for the first time. Amazing voice, amazing soul, amazing guitarist. The book ""Dream Brother"" (mostly paralleling lives and death of him and his famous dad)is not a bad read either."
4,add to your collection,"This is a cd that can be played over and over. Jeff Buckley's voice is amazing. The songs may be recognizable from a few tv soundtracks but the complete cd is worth purchasing. Amazing from start to finish. Besides, Last Goodbye is the ultimate break up song."
5,Our Role Model,"After listening to Jeff for 2 months I have decided that he is a great artist.I first heard Buckley's voice when my sister brought a copy of Grace(Expanded Edition) to my house.I wasn't impressed,I just thought he was a semi-good musician.But after listening to him for a few times I understood his music,his art.Jeff Buckley is our role model,his music inspired me allot.If I will ever be a musician my songs will always be inspired from him."
5,ETHEREAL,"I first heard this album one lazy afternoon lying in the sun with my lovely girlfriend resting quietly beside me. It was one of the only times that I've heard a new album and been literally gob-smacked by the sheer power of the vocals and the angst and passion in the lyrics. After the album had finished, I lay there thinking about what I'd just heard, and my girlfriend (whom I thought was asleep), whispered in my ear ""that was unbelievable!""I won't babble on but all I have to say is that this album is simply one of the most beautiful and almost *ethereal* albums one can own. It sends shivers down my spine just thinking about it now. It really does make you wonder at what he would have offered us had he been granted the time on earth to make more albums. But thankyou anyway Jeff for leaving us with one of the most startling collections of music ever made."
5,Timeless Classic - best love songs I've ever heard,"For the people who know great love songs like U2's 'So Cruel' and Pearl Jam 'Black' this is another to add to your collection. The track 'Lover, you should've come over' is worth buying this disc all by itself. It indeed is now the best love song I've ever heard - I've never felt so much emotion from any singer. Be prepared to weep for the warm hearted."
3,Not for the beginner,"This is certainly a book for a player rated over 1200. The book tends to be a bit biased using a somewhat fixed system. The problem with following the system in the book is that it doesn't teach lower rated players to use some of the openings that cover important tactical ideas. Therefore, after reading this book I decided that this system isn't for me!However, this doesn't mean that if you are fairly advanced that this system isn't for you! The book could use some more variations. Overall it is an ok book."
1,doh!,This is the kind of silly gadget that is harder to use and clean up than just doing the task the old fashioned way. Storage is also a problem. Waste of time and money
3,seems old,out dated and I should have read more did not have all functions my viewfinder was capable of meaning 3d/audio
5,Well Done,"If you are a fan of Leo Kottke and have been having fits trying to learn some of his stuff, this is a great book. I was able to use the music/tab and listen and actually hear things I had not before while trying to learn by listening. Well worth the price!I would caution that this is NOT for beginners, there are some complicated transitions that would just frustrate someone trying to learn guitar."
3,Short and fast black metal,"Very compressed sound for a black metal album, rather heavy, but at 27 minutes quite short too. There are some catchy songs on here and the music is good, but Immortal would easily do better on future releases At The Heart of Winter and Damned In Black which are excellent."
3,Immortals weakest album,"I suppose all bands must eventually make an album that simply doesm't hold up to their previous or later work. In the case of immortal that album is Blizzard Beasts.The album isn't bad in and of itself. its still quality black from norways most windchilled band. But compared to albums like DFM and the later HOW. Blizzard beasts simply doesn't hold up to snuff. If youalready know the band well and have a resonable picture of what to expect, then get the album by all means.If you are just starting out in the realm of Immortal or the realm of Black metal at large, stay clear of Blizzard Beasts for the time being. Especially considering the price."
3,for fans only,"Though Blizzard Beasts is far from Immortal's best, it is still damn good. It is an album that has required repeated listens to fully appreciate. As a whole, it is the fastest paced record in Immortal's catalogue, but unfortunately the speed sometimes seems to take precident over songwriting. There are a number of classic tracks here, including ""Mountains of Might,"" but if you are new to Immortal I would suggest starting with some of their other albums."
5,Immortal has broken up-2003 AD,"One better get their cd or else thingschange and music such as this will be goneforever. News:Immortal has broken up,and this is legit from there website.Blizzard beasts is a great album withsuper beats. This album beats alot of rockalbums out there, and metal bands.so get this while this is available.The drumming of horgh and the razor guitarof demonaz is legendary."
2,This is the only book by him lacking humanity.,"I have read ""Letting Go"" after reading ""Goodbye, Columbus"" and ""Zuckerman Bound"" and I felt bitterly let down by this book. It felt cold, devoid of any real humanity, as opposed to others that I've read. I was expecting fire and life and contradictions and I found lifeless characters and plot lines. It was everything but engaging. I believe Roth was ""trying"" something new here, a new literary approach, and it failed because it made him move away from his own fictive heart and soul-the deeply personal realm, the contradicting impulses in life, the soaring intelligence faced with the everyday compromises, the devastating sense of humour."
4,The case for History as a guide,"I came to this book through a personal study of the secrets of human development. Singapore's miracle of development from 1970 on was the immediate precursor to discovering this work. The architect, Lee Kuan Yew, repeated read Toynbee's work through his career and used the challenge and response theory effectively to lift his country. Study of History is an enduring masterpiece. Clearly, it is more detailed and rich addressing western civilizations than eastern, but some of this imbalance might be due to the abridgement. I also find it interesting to contrast the book with Jared Diamond's ""history as science"" theory and would have loved to have seen Toynbee's consideration of Diamond's scholarship. Though Toynbee's emphasis is on the social, cultural and spiritual levels and boxes in geo physical factors in accord with the science of his era, I believe the two works complement each other in the end."
1,Muddling through history,"This is one those books like Well's Outline of History that seem to reach beyond the grasp of any discipline. Is it a political denouement of historical erudition, a mystical perspective from the shoulder of giants (not cited of course), or just Lord Chicken Little establishing bona fides for advisory status for 10 Downing St. I don't know, and after two volumes of this potage including the kitchen sink, frankly, I don't care. Read Braudel's On History and save yourself a month of soporific gibberish."
1,probably homophobic and too religious,"Two spots are probably homophobic: Mr Toynbee refers to the Greeks' ""unnatural vice""; and to one of the gay Roman emperors, Varius Avitus Bassianus, as a pervert.Although not marked in vol 1, vol I-VI, he sets up for vol 2's vigorous apologetic of the One True God as the reason for the existence of civilizations.Read the Wikipedia biography before reading this book."
5,love this,I loved this show .i can't wait until the next series comes out. I feel that there's not alot of good shows out there. I believe that dawson's creek was one of the great shows.
3,A bit juvenile to say the least,"Unless your a teenager, or an adult wanting to reminisce about your teenage years, Dawson's creek really won't turn you on. It is definitely geared for less mature audiences. However, I think that some of the subject matter shouldn't really be viewed even by teenagers. *************semi spoiler************I wasn't impressed, as a mother, with the affair between Pacey and his teacher, nor that Joey (female) climbs into Dawson's window at night to sleep with him, sweetly platonic at the outset. While all of that is fairly innocent and helps develop the conflict of the program, I don't find it appropriate. I do, however, like the small town setting, but as I said, the maturity level of the program is geared to a younger group of people and I was bored."
5,Great Shows,"Dawson's Creek is an absolutely captivating show. I was so excited when I saw that they put the first season out on DVD. I am slightly disappointed with the special features. There aren't many and the ones that are there seem long and boring, but the ability to pop in the DVD and watch any episode at any given time far outweighs any of the cons of this DVD. It is definantly worth the money."
4,Dawson's Creek DVD hits home again,"The DVD set of Dawson's Creek Season One has once again left me wanting for more. I have been a long time fan of Dawson's Creek and have impatiently waited for the DVD. I was only slightly upset when I realized though that episodes 8 and 9 were missing from this ""complete"" set. There is plenty of enjoyment in what is here...however I really would like to have seen the entire first season as advertised. The episodeds that are here brought back fond memories of tv time with Dawson's Creek and family."
4,Dawson's Creek Season 1,If you read any of the other reviews they go on explaining how good Dawson's Creek was in season one. They are correct in saying that because it is a great show and that is a great season. But most of the reviews I have read said that it started to go south after season 2. I don't think that is true. It is a great show up until the season 4 finale. It only gets bad after that. So its worth buying the first 4 seasons and just watching the rest.
4,One of the best of Dawsons Creek!!!!,Season 1 was great. I started watching this series when it started airing 4 times a day. I bought season 1 and caught up on some missed episodes. The last one is the best and I can't wait for season 2 to come out!!!! PLUS the season finale was outstanding!!! the extra footage!!!! was the best!!
2,Digital Quality-Low,"I just received the 3 DVD set of Dawson's Creek, Season 1. There are 13 episodes with commentaries. All of the episodes playback like the behind-the-scenes ""look"" of most DVDs. Any movement has blocks of data and extra digital lines, not the smooth transition from frame to frame. This is seen on normal playing, slo-mo, and pause. They just tried to fit too many episodes on each DVD and quality data was lost. The only good part is seeing the actors and the story line in the beginning. I don't know if the producers will improve the digital quality in season 2. I hope they do!"
4,A must have but not perfect!,"For me the 2nd season is the best season but this one is the runner up for me. And the best episode of all is in this season (Beauty Contest). But i didnt like the DVD version. It isnt the best quality and there not enough extras. And i wished there was the ""Run Like Mad"" credits which is from the Europian version. (cause i think it suits the series better). And there are some really boring episodes like ""Hurricane"" and ""Baby"". The ""Pilot"" is awesome. If u like this show it is a must have but not the perfect season nor a perfect DVD."
5,Finally,"I am so glad that this series is finally making it to DVD. I became a Dawson's fan after the 3rd season, so am glad that I can now catch up on earlier episodes. This is a great series for anyone interested in reliving the teenage years. The first season is well-written and well-acted."
3,Dawson's Creek Season 1,The product is good quality. It might shatter your nostalgic memories of Dawson's Creek but it's still a good trip down memory lane. Series improves with each season.
3,"The title ""Complete First Season"" is a LIE!!!!","WARNING!!!! DO NOT believe the title on the box. It's a LIE!!! Even though the box says ""Complete First Season"" there are 2 episodes missing. The back of the box lists under Special Features - Three disc set contains the complete first season. It doesn't!!!! Disc One has episodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Disc Two has episodes 5, 6, and 7. Disc Three has episodes 10, 11, 12, and 13. WHERE ARE 8 AND 9????? The box includes the titles and descriptions of all 13 shows. 8 and 9 are described. That's how Sony Pictures can tease you and show you what's missing. Just wanted to warn you. DON'T BE CONNED!!!!!!!"
1,"Boring, unimaginative, and utterly overrated.","(A teen on her dad's account, by the way) Although some people rave about how realistic this show is, it's not. No 15-year-old talks about the stuff these kids are gabbing about (obviously I know).Forlorn Dawson spends one half of the season fawning for the attention of Jen, and the other half whining about how he lost her. Joey spends her days dreaming about Dawson-either hating or loving him. Pacey, after his fling with educator Tamara Jones, becomes an uncool pimp. Jen is constantly pondering whether or not her and Dawson were meant to be (along with putting up with her strict Grams).Every issue is a dramatic, played-out problem for these overly matured ""teenagers"", who look down on anyone who have the slightest different piece of insight.The most interesting part of this O.C./One Tree Hill combo is the truth-or-dare Dawson/Joey and Pacey/Jen kisses in detention.I wouldn't EVER buy this, for the sake of my self-detainment."
1,horrible horrible,This show is very slow and not even good storylines. How did this show make 6 seasons?? Don't buy the dvd. Rent it like me I saved a lot of money. Try One Tree Hill wayyyyy better then this show.
5,THE BEST TV DRAMA EVER,I have the first three seasons on VHS tape!!! No eposides missed! I stoped watching the show the moment they broke up and went to college! THe show is awful now---reminds me of Melrose Place--or 90210 the college years---show [isnt good] now--but be sure to buy the DVD!!! you want to remember the BEST seasons!!! Just the best!!! GOT TO BUY IT FOR YOUR COLLECTION!!!
1,Worse TV show ever,"Poor acting, bad story lines, I definitely think this show its a waste of TIME do not rent it or buy it save your money for more new exciting movies and tv shows coming up this year"
5,great set,"So much fun to go back and watch it all over again! Now my daughter is watching, got good use out of my money!"
3,Content: Great! Quality: Deplorable,I honestly believe that season 1 of Dawson's Creek is 13 of the best hours I have ever seen in the world of television drama. The writing is incredible and the camera work is creative...it's a joy to own this excellent work...The bottom line is you're getting a great show at a great price. But that comes with a price of its own...incredibly sloppy work on the mastering process.
5,Hello! It's Dawson's Creek!,"Nothing makes me think high school like Dawson's creek, Wednesday nights at 8. No matter what else could be going on, everything would have to stop, online conversations resumed at 9 when it was over, boyfriends called back, whatever, but I WOULD see what happened with Joey, Dawson, Pacey and the gang. I can't even believe it's over really, although I don't know what else I expected to happen, but I'm glad that I can have this first season of the Creek to watch whenever I want, and hopefully they will release the rest soon."
5,Pull out your credit card and buy this now!!,"I love this show!! I didn't get to watch all of season 1, so I am so excited to have this come out on DVD!! I got hooked on this show from the very first season, I was a freshman in high school when the show was in it's first season, and I loved growing up with Joey & Dawson and everybody. I cried and laughed and even took my PSAT's the same week they did!! I would recommend this show to anyone in high school, it's realistic and smart, and you'll grow right along with the group. I loved the first four seasons so much, I'm going to snatch them off the shelves the first day they're available... Can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out. Buy it, watch it, I promise you it's worth every penny. You'll never regret it, it was the best show on television. (No offense, but after they graduated, it wasn't the same. I love this show, and it hurts to say that, but it's true.)"
5,Dawson's creek--so great!,Dawson's creek 1st season is so great because it allows you to remember episodes from way back in the day. However i feel that seasons 2-6 should also be put on dvd and sold because this would make the collection complete and allow us to remember our favorite tv show for many years to come!
4,a long-awaited must have for any creek fan,"as soon as i found out that season 1 of dawson's creek was coming out on dvd, i ordered it. since i recieved it, watching each episode has taken up the majority of my free time. i think it is great that dawson's creek is finally out there on dvd, and i can't wait for the second season. the only improvement i would have made was maybe adding a few more special features. other than that, this is definitely worth your money! :)"
5,"A Great First Season, A Great Collection",This is a great dvd set. The only problems is that it doesn't have enough special features.
5,I'm so incredibly exited!,"Anyone who has been obsessed with Dawson's Creek for as long as I have, knows what I huge deal this DVD is. If you have just recently started watching the show, and you think it's awful.. please buy this dvd and realize that when this show first started, it was an artistic masterpiece that literally blew everyone away. Although I personally favor Season 2 to Season 1, most fans would agree that Season 1 was just as amazing, if not more so. The episode on this DVD to watch would definitly be The Beauty Pagent, #111. It pretty much sums up what made this show what it was. To all the fanatics out there who have been watching since they were 10.. and hung up Pacey posters in their locker.. this one is definitly for us. Enjoy!"
2,"Great Season, Bad DVD","The first season of Dawsons Creek was great. Filled with the drama of these Capeside Teens, it has everything to keep you entertained. However, whoever was in charge of editing this to DVD did a screw up job. In more than one part, the dialog is totally mismatched with the characters. Its looks like a bad bruce lee movie. Also the picture is very low quality and the most grainy looking DVD I have ever seen. Only buy this if your a die hard fan, and can overlook these very annoying things."
5,MUST HAVE If you're a DC Fan,"This is the best show that the WB has ever produced. It definitely has sentinmental value as this show premiered just when I was also starting high school. I grew up with this show and could relate to alot of the feelings that were going on between Dawson and Joey. This DVD is a MUST HAVE for every hard-core DC fan like myself. For those who grew up with the show and loved it dearly. It brings back a lot of sweet moments and if you're a D/J fan this is definitely the season for you. For all you fellow P/J fans out there, we'll just have to wait for season 3 to come out. But I hope they plan on releasing all the seasons. This is honestly a great show, it's interesting and relatable. You will just fall in love with the characters and their stories."
5,This is THE show!,"I've just pre-ordered ""Dawson's Creek"" on DVD and i cannot wait until I get the package in my hands and unwrap it.The 1st season DVD edition consists of 3 DVDs with 12 episodes on them + extras.""Dawson's Creek"" is my show, what can I say, I adore it. It has really great dialogs, witty humor, great acting by the to-be-superstars Hollywood youth and it was created by one of the most promising American directors - Kevin Williamson (you've seen the ""Scream"" trilogy, haven't you?).The first season of ""Dawson's Creek"" isn't just a TV show, it's a great example of how a TV show should be like. It's drama, it's comedy, it's romance, and it's real-life problems that everyone of us encountered when we were growing up. I think that is the key factor that makes it so enjoyable. Plus, Katie Holmes is a total fox. :-)If you're hesitating whether to buy it or not...well, I bought a DVD player just to be able to watch it, I think this sums it up quite well."
5,FAN SINCE THE BEGINING,"I remember watching the firts episode when it originaly aired. I knew then that I was hooked on the whole drama of Dawson and Joey, the heartbreak and angst of Jen and the wild goings on of Pacey.My favorite charchter of the series in the begining was Pacey. I guess he still is. I miss DAWSON'S CREEK now that it is over and I will watch and re-watch season 1 DVD until Season 2 is available. Then I'll re-watch both of those until Season 3. This is one show I will be buying every season of.If I had one wish in life it would be that I could have or at least had friends like Dawson, Joey, Pacey and Jennifer.Randy"
4,One of the Best teen Dramas,"Dawson had a way of drawing you into his world. Seasons 1 & 2 were awesome, but like all teen dramas they lose something when they go away to college. At least they have the common sense to end the series on a somewhat good note...Season One was definitly their best. I only hope that these last few episodes that are left are as good as the first episodes"
4,Out of the box,"Love my new bag. Seems to be a tough material, even though I would have prefered leather. I'm extremely happy to have found the product at a much cheaper rate than what the manufacturer offered. Looks good on the bike too."
2,Had problems ---,"The taste is very good. Problems I had were that this was European product soI had to figure how to convert to cups and ounces. Although I like the taste andconvenience, I will not purchase again because of expensive s & h. I will lookfor this product locally unless it's offered by Amazon on Super Saver."
1,Worst ever,I received the package today. It is so not worth the money. Definitely should not an will not buy this one.
1,Disappointing,This printer came free with the purchase of my desktop computer- so I give it one star for cost. After having used it for only a couple of months and a total of maybe 10 to 12 copies I began having problems with the paper loading properly. The loading mechanism pulls the paper to the right rendering it impossible to print or copy anything. While trying to troubleshoot the problem I discovered that more than half of the ink was already used up- and after printing so little! Don't waste your money on this machine. There's a reason they're throwing this little number in for free with the purchase of a computer. . .
1,GARBAGE,"I bought two of these from Office Depot because it was on sale for so cheap. Biggest mistake I've ever made. I used one for my apartment and gave one to my sister to use, and they both broke within weeks. The paper feeder must have been designed by someone with Parkinson's because the paper would always either get immediately stuck or go through the printer crooked. When it did get stuck, the printer would just keep printing on the damn roller, getting ink all over it. Then, the next sheet of paper would have ink smears all over it, if you were lucky enough to have it even come through. I wanted to take this thing outside and beat it with a bat like in Office Space. I will never buy a Canon product again."
1,"Good, except it will lie about the ink","I use this printer for scanning, b&w; printing, and a couple times I accidentally printed something in color.For the most part this printer is good, both the scanning and the printing. My problem with this printer is that its similar to other Canon products in that it either lies about the ink usage, or it chooses to use color to create the b&w; rather than simply use the black ink cartridge. I don't print in color, yet my color cartridge runs out just as frequently as the black cartridge. That is unacceptable deception/theft."
1,Don't buy.,"This is the worst printer I have ever owned. I had just set it up and was given the ""E2"" error, which means it needs paper, long behold, it won't feed the paper. It won't do anything actually. Just flashes the same error, that's all it ever does actually. Worst. Printer. Ever."
2,Cheap not inexpensive. There is a difference,"I am very disapointed with this machine.I had an Epson printer before. My new computer was offered with a Canon mp210 multifunction. I wanted a multifunction instead of getting a scanner because of space issue. I hardly ever use either, but find it handy to have them. The Canon ink cartridges last such a short time that I find it cheaper to take copies to the nearest quick print store. Now I find that the scanner won't work if ink is empty. I can't share pictures on the computer without ink. Ink is too expensive. I will probably get out my old Epson and buy another scanner. I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone."
2,Doesn't last,"I don't use my printer very often but when I do I'd like it to work. This printer worked for about maybe 20 uses. I think I had to change the ink after about 15 pages. I few uses later and it no longer works. All it does now is crush paper. I'd like to consider myself a capable electronics user, I mean I've built several computers, but this printer just will not work. So I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It would be cheaper and more convenient to go to kinkos for every print."
2,printer broke after 2 months of paper jamming...,"This printer kept getting jammed . I pulled the paper out wrong and it broke...I need to order a new one and i have new ink in it, which probably does not fit other printers.lemon...."
1,"Poor print quality, eats ton of ink",The print quality is poor and it goes thru ink cartridges faster than any other printer I've had. Also takes long time to print page. Avoid this printer
1,Did not last as long as the ink cartridges,"I purchased this printer just under 2 1/2 months ago. It did well and gavesharp copies. I went to use it today, and it will not power up. I usesurge protection on my computer and peripherals, and with no external powersupply, I am left with an oversized paperweight."
2,Do Not Buy This Printer!!!,"Don't get me wrong, it works fine and the quality is ""good"" but the MAJOR problem with this product is that the ink runs dry almost immediately - I am forever running to Staples or Office Depot and spending 30 bucks for a b/w and a color cartridge. The b/w will print MAYBE 2 scripts and the color? Horrible. After printing 6 8x10 photo's (yes, I understand this printer isn't for photo's, but when you need a presentation...) the color is gone. That equates to about 3 bucks a page!!!Pay the money and get a printer where the ink will last."
2,Lousy Software,"The images seem good enough. The software, however, is SO SO anti-intuitive. Every little thing I want it to do requires 10 minutes of hunting through the program to find where the function is and how to apply it.I wish EPSON printers would make a comeback."
2,Paper feed issues,"This printer does produce high quality pictures when the paper feeds correctly. The scanning function also is fine, but both are majorly overshadowed by the poorly designed paper feed function. The wheel that pulls the paper in from the tray is off to one side, so it (naturally) pulls the paper in CROOKED. Very frustrating. I've wasted a lot of paper trying to get around this problem. It jams, misfeeds, or prints crookedly at least 75% of the time. I've had the printer for about a year--and the problem has gotten worse with time."
2,Disappointed,"This printer is useless. Lid hinge tabs were broken, paper feed upper guide was missing, ink carrage sticks & noisy causing printing to waver. Should have been sold for parts because that is exactly what I have to is make 1 printer out of my old one using parts from this junk. Should have gone to E Bay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent bargain!,"This is a ridiculously good deal. You get a printer, scanner, and copier, all for a very good price. I've had the MP210 for only two days, but I have used it a lot and used all of its features and done quite a bit of printing. So far, so good.I got my new Dell notebook with WinXP, so setup was a snap. Also, the printer came with both ink cartridges, something other manufacturers do not include. I have been buying Canon printers lately because they have been superior in every way - unlike other brands I had used in the past."
3,No USB Cable Included!,Would it pain Canon to include a USB cable so you could hook it up to your computer right away? And only one other reviewer mentioned that?? Well that's the review I didn't read. What's wrong with all of you who bought this? Does everyone have extra USB cables lying around like spare change? Thanks Amazon Prime for getting this to me in two days. Now I need to drag myself down to the store to get a new cable. Who knows how many days that will take me...
1,Where's the USB??,"Bought this as part of a bundle from Best Buy. Went to install it and no USB cable. I look on-line and Canon doesn't include it in the packing list.WTF is that??? I have to make another trip out to get a cable??? Would it kill Canon to throw in a USB cable so I can use it right away? What if Dell or Mac sold computers without keyboards, or mice. Or they sold you mice but you had to buy the cables separately???C'mon Canon, get real!"
4,I love this thing!,"I have had my Canon MP210 printer for over a year. I bought it clearance at Best Buy for $60, and I have never looked back.This baby does everything I need, with great quality and speed.It does go through the ink, which is spendy unless you know where to look. ;)"
2,Dell laptop users be aware -- Not compatible!,ProsGood printing and scanning functions. Reasonable price for what it does.ConsDELLL INSPIRION 700M USERS BE AWARE -- MAJOR SOFTWARE INCOMPATIBILITY!! CANON ALL-IN-ONES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED BY YOUR LAPTOPS!!!
3,OK printer for home office,"I have had this printer for 3 weeks. It is decent. It does; however, use up ink quickly and it does not print pictures well (though I did not buy it for this function). All in all, decent for home office use."
1,Loss Leader,When Gilette invented the safety razor in 1902 he practically gave them away. This was because he knew he would make much more money selling the blades. The tactic was called a loss leader. That's what Canon is doing with this printer. The ink is very expensive and produces fewer prints than any other printer I have ever owned by far. My printer is still working well but I'm throwing away this otherwise OK machine because I can't afford to feed it.
1,The worse thing ever made - Keep Out !,"Short and simple: Please do not buy this junk. It came free with both mine and my girlfriend's Macbooks. Not only it has the dishonest feature of not allowing you to print black and white if the color cartridge is out (something the companies do exclusively so you are forced to buy more ink), and you do not have any controls over quality (not being able to print in draft mode, for instace - also a way to force people to have to buy more ink) but the paper feeder is the crappiest quality you'll ever see and it simply breaks after a while and you are left thinking that you should not have accepted the printer even for free."
3,A single paper jam screwed the printer,"I have used this printer for several years with no problems. I liked it because it is easy to use with straight-forward controls and reasonably fast printing. Then one day, I had a paper jam. This was the beginning of the end. I now have a permanent C3 error; not even the scanning feature works. I suspect the paper sensor got screwed up as part of the paper jam. I think it's pretty poor that a single paper jam can mess up a printer to such an extent it no longer functions. If it weren't for this, I'd have given it 5 stars."
2,good as new?,"when I saw the item I needed, I really thought that the item was good as new. When I opened the package, I was really disappointed with what I saw. I mean, I did not expect a new one but at least the printer should have been in good shape- the cover was broken, springs not in place, no cd for installation. It was disappointing. I want to return it, but what will i get from it. I already spent my money for shipment so just be satisfied with it."
5,Excellent Stuff,"This movie came out a year after I was born and I still have the original vhs today. I love the Transformers and I still collect the figures. This movie sways far away from the series because alot of characters die in this one. When I first saw this I was dissapointed to see Prime Die but it was all good, I love Hot Rod or Rodimus Prime whatever u wish to call him and I like the old timer Kup I think he was a great character. The Dinobots add alot of great Comedy to this movie which makes it all the better and the movie introduces us to alot of mysterious and pretty cool characters, I think Orson Welles was a great choice to play Unicron, his voice matches well with the giant planet and Lenord Nimoy was a good choice for Galvatron who I thought was a great character. This movie should be in every transformer fans collection. Is absolutely great."
2,Not what I thought it was,"I thought this was a soundtrack to Black Jack the Anime series, it wasn't. I gave it to my brother because it is heavy metal type music."
5,Art Studio,"My daughter got this for her 2nd birthday. I very much like it and so does my daughter. Crayola provides two sets of letters for the alphabet and numbers in case you lose a set. My daughtger stays very occupied with this for sometime. I dont suggest this for children who tend to put things in their mouth the letters and numbers ex: the 1 and L are small and easy to swallow. On that note my daughter also likes to stand on the stool (thats the age) however it's a sure keeper. I'm glad we got it the toy stores no longer carry it. I place paper dry erase markers near her and she is good to go. Its excellent for learning, my daughter loves her letters and numbers she knows all of them since 20mos. this easel is an added bonus for her to keep on top of learning."
5,The 'decision' book,"In my opinion, Joe Vitale used his excellent capacity to write to give us, successfully, a very simple and immediate book about our power inside. I believe who buys this kind of book is people who is not reading about this argument for the first time; and what happens often is that we have the sensation of reading 'already known' things, and so we finish one book and begin another...just to have the same sensation! Joe's book, for me, had the power of 'making me act' finally, instead of only read and read! It's pretty simple, and he really makes us understand how to make our desires happen. Without being too long, he touches the main points and explain what is necessary to understand to get what we want. At the end, we do not need to know how a fax machine works to send a fax, do we? For whom might be interested, I translated it to portuguese, and you can find it at http://www.pensamento-positivo.com"
3,one of those books about feeling good.,"if you have read books like positive thinking by napoleon hill or clement stones, this book is sort of a copycat. nothing new, sorry."
2,nope,It's an entertaining but slapdash very short self help book with most of the ingredients covered in depth by Dr. Phil. Wouldn't recommend it unless you want to see the pretty good quality of a web-based self published book.
5,"It has changed my life, for the better!","I am grateful for this gem of wisdom; both to the author for writing it, and to the person who referred me to Joe's website. Joe has taken a fundamental, yet profound approach to inviting spirit into all that we do, and offers simple and yet life-altering techniques for ridding ourselves of limiting beliefs and replacing them with tools to achieve the life we truly want and deserve! It has become one of my ""collected bibles"" to one day share with my children!"
5,Step out of your old mold and into spiritual freedom,"Book Review: Joe Vitale has written many books but the book, ""Spiritual Marketing"" has, to me, been impactful.I questioned why have I been stuck year after year writing the same goals and not making any forward progress? Not only does Joe give a 5-step program to get unstuck, but also he gives exercises to help you reach your achievement goals. He teaches how to find your blocks and get rid of them.I have hundreds of books, but this one kept calling to me to read it. I will not only read it once but over and over until I move forward at rocket speed."
5,"Clear, Easy to Read, Inspiring","Spiritual Marketing pulls together a lot of information and ideas from other books and presents it in a way that is clear and easy to understand. It also adds the crucial step of clearing away the old beliefs. If I fall into negative thinking patterns, I read it again, and it inspires me to get back on track."
3,"OK, but NOT a life-changing experience","This book took about half an hour to read and while I didn't ask for my money back, it's not something I would praise to the skies either.Vitale does have his finger on some valid principles of overcoming mental limitations, and he writes well, but there's not much here that you won't find in other books on the same topic."
5,I tried to give it 10 stars...,"This book is fantastic! I have been a fan of Joe Vitale's for quite some time now, and always enjoy the sincere encouragement with which he empowers his readers. But I found that Spiritual Marketing stands on its own as a unique marketing and business book. Joe really made a stretch this time by bringing spiritual principles into the business world. Long overdue, I am starting seeing this happen more and more. As a businessman, I believe that we have leaned way too much toward the head, and should be considering the heart as we balance our business affairs and decisions. My favorite in Spriritual Marketing is Step 5, ""Let Go"". This is very POWERFUL stuff whose time has come. Thank you, Joe, for writing Spiritual Marketing. Moreover, thank you for having the courage to be among the leaders who are showing the rest of us that there is a different way, a better way."
5,a NECESSARY book,"Wow! What a challange for my thinking and beliefs of myself!!I just got finished reading it; I have also read such classics as ""Think and Get Rich,"" ""Mach II With Your Hair On Fire,"" ""Get Rich Slow,"" ""The Science of Getting Rich"" and ""Born Rich"" (among others). With each book, I get closer and closer to breaking free of my stifling beliefs...I will use this book to help me uncover the reason for my beliefs so that I can change my thinking.Thank you, Joe Vitale!!!"
5,OH YEAH BABY!!!,"I bought this book because I am a wanna be investor. My husband saw it, opened the cover and I haven't seen the book since!! He tells me all that he raves about from reading this and that!! I read the first chapter and really want to read the WHOLE THING! I emailed Vitale and told him we are ecstatic over what he has shared.....!You will be too!!! Buy it.You won't go wrong."
5,"YOUR LIMO has arrived - BUY THIS BOOK, and your on your WAY","I could write a short story telling u about how every single aspect of Joe's book is TOTALLY, from the heart, sincere, as real as real can be, clear and precise and suitable for anyone of any age, race, or religion.But the BOTTOM LINE IS SIMPLY THIS:IT WORKS ! IT WORKS ! IT WORKS !BUY IT NOW ! BUY IT NOW ! BUY IT NOW !PS - Just do it !"
5,Spiritual Marketing,"After nearly 30years in sales and reading eveything I can get my hands on about sales and marketing this one is the best,get it, read it, do it, it works."
1,"Buy Joe's other book, Attractor Factor, instead!",The only reason I give this book one star is because everything in it is also in Vitale's other book The Attractor Factor. Attractor is an expanded and much better version that I rated 5 stars and which I highly recommend.
1,Joe's plagiarism of God,"Much of the ""new"" techniques that Joe claims to have discovered are really biblical principles stripped of their context and reformed into a humanistic, God-less mold and repackaged to make the author wealthy.Joe has very little knowledge of how ""spiritual"" things work. I can tell by his own verbiage.He needs to get hooked up with the creator then he can share what he has found. But without knowledge of the ONE who started it all, Joe is just ""all wind and noise, signifying nothing."""
1,Mystical Monuments of Ancient Greece,"This film's strength lies in the beautiful panoramic photography of Greece and the Islands. The historical content is weak, very elementary, slightly overdramatic. Not worth the money!"
1,"Sucks, save your money.","I purchased this DVD because i was writing a short story that i decided would be based in Seattle.This DVD sucks. The run time is 25 minutes. The information very limited, i was no better off after watching it.I found better information just browsing the web. I could have done better filming it myself with a video camera and grabbing some homeless dude off the street to do the commentary."
3,"I love Articolo 31, but...","I love Articolo 31, but this CD contains mostly concert performances, and I don't like concert recordings. To make it worse, these ones are especially bad. You can barely hear some of the music. I would have given it a lower rating, but it came with a DVD that includes Articolo 31's music videos. Just a warning, though, it's encoded for region 2 DVD player, so unless you have an all regions DVD player (which I fortunately do), it won't play."
2,It always craps out!,"I'm in seventh grade and I bought this because i thought it might help me with my vocabulary and it had cool features. None of the definitions are good unless you look up a small word, as another person said. And the features ar cool but a lot of times the whole thing freezes. And then you lose all your information and settings. For example, It has place where you can put in people's phone numbers. I had aout 20 and then it froze. I had to reset it and I lost all the numbers. I also lost all my settings (Time, Date, etc.). For he most part, the games suck(the best ones are tic-tac-toe and hangman. Yeah, pretty sad.) Only decent thing is the calculator. It really only deserves 1 1/2 stars, but I'll be nice and give two."
1,Franklin Dictionary,"The Franklin Dictionary is frankly a piece of junk! My daughter received this item as a gift for Christmas and four months later, not working, even with new batteries."
2,This thing Stinks!,I read earlier reviews and tehy said it had problems with taking too much time to load a word but this dumb piece of junk had a cracked screen after having it a month. dont buy it it is a waste of $30
1,save your money,"I have severe allergies to dust and dust mites. I ordered this, thinking that it was the cure for sneezing and stuffy nose at night. Wrong! Didn't help at all. Only thing that cured the dust mite problem was a temper-pedic 1 1/2 inch foam mattress. It's so dense that nothing can get through it. I no longer wake up in the middle of the night with allergy problems.Invest in a temper-pedic, it's worth the investment for a full nights sleep."
3,Twisted dedication,"To truly understand Hitler, one must read his manifesto, not someone elses opinion on the man & his ideology. He outlines his plans for Russia, the Jews, and the 3rd Reich. What gets me is that when he came to power in 1933 the rest of the world didn't take him seriously. Did Stalin even read Mein Kampf? While he is one of the most notorious figures in the 20th or any century for that matter, there are few world leaders that have matched the depth of his dedication evil though it was. Hitler was the rarest of birds in the political arena-The true believer & this is evidenced by his actions. This book reads more like a collection of twisted thoughts without any specific order rather than a work with any sort of continuity. The last thing I have for Hitler's actions is admiration, but one must be objective when reading a book by so notorious an author, then make your own judgement."
5,Historical importance,"Great historical reference. Hitler's work lays out the architecture of what would become life in the Third Reich. Had this work been taken seriously, history would certainly have been altered. It is clear from this work all non Aryans could not live in his new Germany and the antisemetic ranting clearly sets out what policies to be put in place in dealing with the Jews of Europe. Chillingly, the steps to the final solution to the Jewish question was laid out years before it would take place, yet the world chose to ignore it. This work should be considered as an imperative read for all historical scholars."
3,Exhausting but Informative,"Hitler's writing style is very ponderous and rambling. That may be due in part to the translation, but I doubt it. Hitler seems to have a few catch phrases that mesmerized the unthinking German worker, and he just kept repeating them until everyone was stirred up. It is too bad that the rest of the world did not read the book and take him more seriously. It might have avoided a lot of trouble later on."
2,Hitler's Rise to Power,"Hitler rose to power when his book Mein Kampf, meaning My Struggle in English, became popular throughout Europe. He blamed all of Germany's problems on the Jews- they controlled the banks and the media, had money and didn't spend it, horrible for the economy. Also it was revenge for Germany's embarassment during World War One. The language is foul- kike this, Jew that. They set up concentration camp ghettos- sent into gas chambers and ovens. I think it is a sour taste on 20th century Germany. Thise who survived the Holocaust mostly fled to America. Martin Luther started the Jew bashing in the 1500s when he opened up the door to Protestantism. The Jews tried to reinvent themselves as successful. I think Hitler is a joke. Hungary was bought out during WWII and along with Austria was a big turncoat- Sweden remained a neutral country. I wasn't around during WWII, I don't know what it was like. Transylvania was bought out during WWII."
2,pure academic interest in history,"It appears that the book was authored by various writers because grave differences in style, and depths of expertise and conclusions. It was supposed to have been written during the author's imprisonment, during which he was able to entertain visitors and make use of amenities such as a library. I would not be surprised, if he had made use of ghost writers."
5,Awesome,It was perfect. Even better condition than described. Came in timely fashion and CHEAP!!! thanks a ton!
1,"Interesting, but False","This book is an interesting read to say the least. Rambling, repetitive, incoherant at times, and always ludicrous, this book is a blueprint for genocide. The ideas in this book are so far beyond the realm of fact that it could be considered black comedy if millions of innocents hadn't lost their lives as a result of the venom contained therein. Anyone who cannot read this book and see past the facile solutions presented for our world's problems is ignorant in the worst way and/or a racist and anti-Semite. There is no Zionist conspiracy, the Jews did not kill Jesus, and eugenics is the stuff of fantasy. Anyone who says ANYTHING to the contrary or agrees with any idea put forth in this book is a hate monger and an anti-Semite."
1,No longer need to read it,"Thanks to all the reviews here, I no longer need to read it. Some people do not like to see films after they've read about them in some critic's review and already know the story. I know Hitler's story.I am surprised the nut-job did not seemingly know about or use to his advantage the long history of anti-semitism in his beloved Germany from the time before Luther, another nut-job. They certainly knew how to murder Jews.Whether or not Hitler was knowledgable I do not know, but he certainly had some imagination, especially his insane racial theory."
5,Wendy Doniger wrote a similar book about Hindus,"Wendy Doniger of Univ of Chicago writes similar books on Hinduism and Hindus. Except she titles them ""Hindus: An alternate history"" to spew her hate about Hindus.I wonder if she would accept this book as academically sound, if ""Mein Kampf"" was reworded as ""Jews: An alternate history""."
1,pass the advil,"hmmm...this book reads like a madman's amphetamine-driven rants. read it AFTER you read ""rise and fall of the third reich"" by william shirer, ian kershaw's 2-volume hitler biography, and shakespeare's ""richard III."""
1,The Bible of anti-Semitism,"This is the book that was the most influential in causing the Holocaust. I hated the book so much and all the remembrance of the Holocaust came to me when I was reading it (Schlinder's Lists, etc.) that I was not up to finishing it. The book is terribly long and coping with such a dose of raw hate was too much for me. Its anti-Semitic arguments are still powerful, even though weaker than 80 years ago...I would recommend that only Jews or philo-Semites read this book, others may be swayed away, seduced by many classical anti-Semitic arguments (the alleged ethnicity of the first communists and the communist takeover in Russia, concerning financial and media power, etc.) And one Holocaust is enough."
1,Mein Kampf,"Talk about long winded!!! I find this a difficult read, he goes from one subject to another leaving me saying ""whaaaaaat??"". Maybre I'm just a moron, got up to page 75ish & chucked. I read for pleasure, why tourture myself??!!! It's too bad because he has always facinated me...."
5,amazing,this product was amazing. the condition in which it was shipped and in which it arrived was astonishing. the product arrived by the date specified and the product itself was very enjoyable and entertaining.
3,Psycho king of the twentieth century,"Here is more than a sick puppy,this is the devil incarnate,and i resent these other reviewers who comment on his style,or his sentence composition.This is not just another book,this is a book written by a man who was responsible for the systematic annihalation of 6 miillion jews along with about20 million russians and on and on,he was a horrific man,or rather beast,and this book details the foundations of what he wanted... the third reich,the pure Aryan race.Reading ""Mein Kampf""and casually commenting on it as though it were jusy another book,is like reading Karl Marx ""Das Kapital"" and calling another book on economics.Joseph Brauner"
3,A Great look inside the mind of Adlof Hitler,"When reading this book it is important to keep a perspective about the times in which it was writen. I enjoyed the book even though some of it got repetitious. Hitler goes from being viewed as an out-of-work down-on his luck Bum, to a dedicated soldier, to a crazy mastermind and a compulsive Manic-Depressive. It's real easy to get inside of his head as he pretty much writes whatever seems to come into his mind at the time. I read it at the same time as two other books in order to give me an historic perspective. It is important to know your history to fully enjoy this book."
4,Don't Judge a Book by it's Author,"This book may not be a great literary peace of art but it's a good token for history. In the book Hitler does call Jews, Commusist, Catholics, etc. bad names and says bad things about them; but in Mark Twain's book ""Huck Finn"" don't blacks get bad titles? So if your not going to read the book for that reason it's a bad choice! Don't get me wrong I'm not a Nazis actually I'm a Roman Catholic and I still read the book and thought it was good for history reasons. Only one thing he does ramble alot and you must be willing to suffer through it. It does show one of the most intelligent minds with the most bad intentions>"
4,4 stars for historical significance...,"I state the reason for my rating because, while this is the idealogy of an evil man, objectively it is an extremely important historical document that cannot be overlooked.It is important to realize that from the outside looking in, the results of certain philosophies are so terrible that we often refuse to examine them beyond the death and destruction.The truth is, however, that there is a thought process in bigotry, eugenics, etc. Though it is indeed logically flawed, it is still an ethical duty for all to look at the literature and philosophies that result in a very human evil."
4,An excellent way to understand part of history,"If you are one of those people who are looking to further understand history by reading literature, then you will probably want to read Mein Kampf. In this book, you will find the ideologies and personality that led Adolf Hitler to take the course that he did. You will be able to further understand why things happened and why Hitler acted the way he did. Keep in mind, however, that this book must be read with an open mind that wishes to learn more about this aspect of history.Mein Kampf was not written for you to sit down and read for enjoyment, and it should not be taken that way. The reading can be slow at times, but if you really wish to learn more about Hitler, the Third Reich, and what led to the Second World War, then this book is an indispensible resource."
4,Just a nut eh?,"Hitler is often refered to as satan or crazy, but was he? There is no denying that he along with the Nazi party killed many million Jews and other groups but to judge him as an intellectual squarly on his actions is harsh. If one reads this book and takes the time to let it sink in, he or she will soon realize that this man was extremely intellectual. He was not evil, possesed by the devil, or satanic in anyway but just wanted better. It is said in this book that all he wants is a better life for the people of his race. Although he took this to an extreme in killing other races, he had a good idea. He just wanted a prospering community without hunger or violence. Wrongly, Hitler chose to make his dream by denying basic human rights to others. I am not a Nazi nor do I glorify Hitler in any way, but if one truly takes the time to listen, he or she might learn the other side of the one-sided story taught to us in school."
2,The Awful Power of Ridiculous Ideas,"When we think of Hitler today, it is hard not to see him as the man who led a nation to the brink of globe-spanning power and demographic revolution. The Hitler who wrote Mein Kampf was not yet a grand figure, but a rather pathetic racist demagouge who lacked an education, a knowledge of history, and any well-formed, decent ideas. By all means, read this book if you are interested in the modern history of Europe, but understand that this is not the work of a man who knew much about what he attempts to describe. Influenced not by reason and truth, but by absurd racial philosophy, Mein Kampf is terrifyingly devoid of clarity. That it became a holy book of a national movement for twenty years is a testimony to the unholy persuasive powers of the author and to the dreadful pathology of his age."
4,Mein Kamf,"Curiosity got the best of me, my families ties with Germany have made me wonder why Hitler did what he did. I have family that were in Germany during Hitler's rise and they were directly effected. I have not read it yet, partially due to what I already know of his history. But I am planning on reading it when I have time to read it entirely."
2,BLUEPRINT FOR GENOCIDE,"Hitler was as good as his word. One of the few politicians who did exactly what he planned to do, as described in this horrible book. ""Know your Enemy"" is good advice. I read this book as a high school student in an attempt to understand the most murderous doctrine of the 20th century. I was left feeling nothing but contempt for the book, though I appreciated the efforts of the people who translated it. Those who attempt to apologize for Hitler should be ashamed of themselves."
2,Hitlers views exposed,"Mein kampf roughly translated means my struggle. but how can a man who knows only hatered know anything about a struggle. in this in depth review of his life events he trys to portray his life as one of many inner tormoils. in the 600 or so pages he explicitly made his views known about the jewish community. not being jewish i read this book with an open mind and a huge curiosity about a book that has caused so much trouble. this book however should NOT be read by anyone who i sthe least bit sensitive to the subject matter portrayed. Hitler sees ""jewism"" as a plauge and he thinks and feels its the jews that bring his country down. His own inner stuggle comes to light in comments he makes such as "" i free the world of all that is jewish so that i do the work of the almighty"". His fears are well shown as well as his insecurities. i would recomend this book to anyone whith an open mind to just how sick our society has become."
2,Holocaust - the blueprint,"Mein Kampf is interesting to read, not because Hitler is a great writer but because it gives us a glimpse of what went on in the mind of the man. He has some surprisingly shrewd insights but his plans and ambition are pure dementia. It's very political but his plans for the supremacy of the race and destruction of the inferior ones are clearly outlined and the ""philosophy"" behind it simply put: basically, the way of Nature is survival of the fittest and Germans will be the fittest and ANY means will be acceptable to that end.I simply CANNOT believe any reviewer who actually read the book could write, as one did: ""he never suggested the harming of the handicapped, Gypsies or Jews in Mein Kampf, or in any of his writings.""You have to be incredibly blind, incredibly obtuse or incredibly hypocritical to not see the writing on the wall in Mein Kampf. But before 1933, I don't think any one could have CONCEIVED of such ideas actually being carried out in practice."
5,mein kampf,The book is very informative in respect of having an insight into the subject's beliefs and values.I would recommend the book to anyone who has a genuine interest in world history.
3,he really believed what he says,"to him what he said was very true, he really believed what he was saying. he was an intelligent and well respected bavarian soldier, who for some reason became infatuated with the ""threats of Marxism"" and the annihilation of all foreigners specifically the those of jewsih descent. he didnt make himself leader the people made him leader, so they agreed with him. he shouldnt bear 100 percent of the blame. its a very interesting read, one can follow the trasformation that transpires within hitler through the course of the book. when i was reading it, he was justifying everything he stated, i dont remember reading any statements he didnt back up with personal information."
5,A Journey Into The Mind Behind The Man,"This book is an excellent journey into the mind of Adolf Hitler. The author, Adolf Hitler, writes his struggle in shocking detail. Every reader in America should read this book to understand the mind of one of the most influencial leaders of all time. Regardless, of personal feelings about the man, he still was the one dictator to single-handedly transformed a country in shambles, to a counrty taking over the world. No politician has ever done what Hitler did. Adolf Hitler vividly depicts his life the way he saw it, not the way we all interpret it. If one reads this book one can fully understand the causes of World War II and understand fully where the Germans came from. Many readers will think differently after reading this book."
3,"An interesting read, especially if you want to know about Hitler","This is a great historical book to read. It definitely lets the reader into the mind of Adolf Hitler and his life prior to when he became the Hitler we all know. After reading this, it is suprising anyone allowed him to get so powerful (remember, he became dictator legally in Germany). This is a LONG and dense book filled with hate but it's a book that must be read if one wants to understand the Holocaust, Adolf Hitler, and World War II. Any historian should definitely read this, as well as history buffs."
3,Mein Bericht,"After all the victors' propaganda, it's interesting to read Hitler's actual words. From erudite consideration to all-out rant, it's an illuminating peek into his pre-war thought processes.The linguistic style is convoluted and it does take some stamina to get through 628 pages.This edition is marred by the editors sycophantic apologetic commentary. The books stands by itself as an historic artefact; there was no need to apologise for publishing it. Editors' time would have been better spent on explanatory and contextual notes.I've not researched the original content enough to determine whether the translation was accurate or not. Other reviewers believe it not to be, so you may want to consider another edition."
5,Excellent night time reading,"Want to know what went on in the mind of one of the worlds most famous tirants? Then go ask him. Oh no you cant, so read this instead.Its well written and shows a seriously twisted mind, and acts as a warning to what a twisted mind can achieve given the right circumstances and motivation.Dont buy this if you expect a cheap jew-bashing novel, but do buy this if you think you can handle a well built up argument as to exactly why Hitler believed what he did."
2,Justification for his Pre-existing prejudice.,"A 350+ page anti-liberal, bigoted rant. It is riddled with deliberate mis-interpretations of the accepted scientific theory of evolution, natural selection, and 'survival of the fittest', circular reasoning, christian apologetics, outright racism, and baseless anti-Jewish propaganda. The only value this book has to a modern, free society is as a primary historical source and insight into the psyche of the original author. I bought this book as a supplement for my latest Open University module (Religion in History) which will take me halfway through a history degree. (The principal importance of the study of history is to avoid repetition of humanity's past mistakes.)"
5,"Putrid, but Important to Take a Look at","During the Nazi Era, this book was the most un-read bestseller in Europe. Lots of people purchased the volume, but very few took the time to read it.Therein lies a tragedy; Hitler had outlined his entire diabolical program before it was carried out. In Mein Kampf, Hitler's evil blueprint was laid out in detail, but nobody knew much about it because they didn't take the time to read it.This book is putrid and evil, but revealing."
3,Bad cover photo,I was disappointed that the cover did not match the one shown. Mine is black without any symbol. Not nearly as cool looking as the blue photo.
4,Art Literature.,"Adolf Hitler does an credible job of providing the reading about the history of his life, philosophy, and nation before he peacefully took power in the 1930's. The very fact that Hitler was an artist(his specialty was oil-painting), becomes understandably apparent after reading ""Mein Kampf."" Simply put, this author creates a book that is a literary representation of art.The literary stile that Adolf Hitler uses reads like a novel. Some have said that his book may drag at certain points, I would only argue that Hitler's artistic nature becomes translated into an immeasurable literary genius. But in the sense that Hitlers literary composition may ""drag"" for some readers, I recommend the book ""Nature's Eternal Religion"" by Ben Klassen. Klassen's book provides a more modern perspective for the reader that most people in the 21st century just can't understand with works such as ""Mein Kampf."""
2,Simply a poorly written book.,"No matter what you think of Hitler's philosophy, this book is poorly written. Mr. Hitler despite his keen ability to commit a coup d'etat, run a fascist nation, and run a murderous holocaust he certaintly has trouble keeping his train of thought."
2,Uphill work,"Whether just badly written or badly translated, Mein Kampf is a tough read in English. The most interesting parts are the action plans Hitler had in mind for the National Socialists. His insights into the vapidness of the media and the political timidity of the average citizen are quite acute. But this is far outweighed by the unsupported theorizing on race and history and by the Jew-baiting. This was a man in a hurry, who couldn't spare the time to research or re-write this very rough draft, although in the end it did him ample service as it was."
3,Life's A Struggle... so is reading this book,"I could not finish this book.... simply put, the writing style makes the book heavy, each page is a struggle to get through. The book just made me feel more dislike for Hitler than I had before."
1,I Refuse To Pay More Than One Penny For What Cost The Publisher NOTHING.,This book is an historical document. It belongs to the world. It was paid for by millions of deaths. Who are the POS publishers who want to make money off this? I have my suspicions...
3,Do not fit on Fujinon binoculars,This strap will only fit binoculars with a Clic-Loc fitting for strap attachment. This excludes Fujinon and some other makes of binoculars. Because of that I was unable to use them but they are similar to the original straps which worked well until they wore out (after 5 years of almost daily use and living outdoors).
2,d,"I returned to strap, because I found a better one.I returned to strap, because I found a better one."
2,It was a waste,I got this because I thought this was a book I needed. I never read it. I flipped the pages and was like whatever. It was a waste
5,Awesome!,"Started out as something that I wasn't sure about reading, but am glad to have given it more time to prove it was very worth reading."
1,What kind of personal crisis is she dragging us through?,Laurell Hamilton must have been more despondent than I realized about the death of her Baby Bird that she dedicated this book to. I loved the new characters and story line she developed but she dropped them and us cold in the final five chapters with no salve or warmth to make it okay.I despised it when Ann Rice dragged us along on her theological crisis after hooking us with her earlier books. I am not going to like it any better if Laurell Hamilton behaves similarly by the wonton destruction of her characters when she is grieving.I agree with another of the reviews. I hope she writes a sequel (and quickly) that provides the characters with some hope and relief.
4,Quite a change,"If you are looking for typical Hamilton, you won't find it here. It had intrigue and suspense and interesting plot twists. This is one of the few books of hers that I did not know what was going to happen in the end. A little dark. But a nice change from sex and angst."
3,Something new,Laurell K Hamilton is one of my favorite authors and it was nice to read something new from her. The book was a good read overall but the characters lacked the depth I've come to expect from this author.
1,The worst Ravenloft book in the series...,"I've read the majority of this series and this one is by far the worst. It's painfully obvious that Laurell K. Hamilton has never played D&D and has little to no idea how Ravenloft has been portrayed by her fellow authors. The first Ravenloft book that I read concerning Harkon Lukas was ""Heart of Midnight,"" which was excellent. In that book, Lukas was suave, sophisticated and subtle in his evil. Here, he's just plain bloodthirty and cruel, not at all how I pictured him after reading HOM. Maybe LKH is a decent author. I don't know, since this is the only novel of hers I've ever read. All I know is that she has no clue how to write for D&D."
2,Not one of her best works,"LKH always keeps you in suspense, there's no doubt about it, but this one leaves you unsatisfied w/ lots of unanswered questions and one very unhappy ending.Maybe, however, this is just the way of the Ravenloft world...of this I cannot be sure."
3,she strikes again,I have read Laurell K. Hamiltons Anita blakes series. when thirst for more of her writing I borrowed an old copy of this story from a friend.Her attention to detail and way of describing the emotions her character goes through are intense and well written out. Hamilton is an amazingly talented writer and if you like this amazing story you'll love her other books as her skills develop. if you don't like fantasy/mystery don't pick it up...but if you do don't you dare walk away!
2,Deeply disappointing and unsatisfying,"This book through me for a loop. I have read and Love all the Anita Blake Series and Meredith Gentry Series, but this book was totally different, it was very dark and disturbing. Though it was well worded written, the characters lacked the vitality of her other books, it was just to mortifying to be enjoyed. If you love Anita Blake and Meredith Gentry I wouldn't suggest reading this book, it takes away from the spirit and Vitality of her other books, and characters. It has neither happy endings nor any happiness in between, it's depressing and sad. It also ended with finality, leaving far too many loss ends and questions about other characters and surroundings. It is almost as if she got tired of writing it and ended it halfway through the process."
3,Rather slow and a little weak,"This is the first Ravenloft novel that I have read - I picked it up because it was written by LKH.While the charactisations are good, the story lacks the punch and drive of her other novels and she again explores the idea of a girl growing into magical powers (as in Anita Blake and Nightseer) and her subsequent possible descent into evil."
1,Laurell Hamilton wrote this?,I have been a Laurell Hamilton fan for years. This is my first disappointment in her writing. Hard to believe she wrote this. It started off pretty good but went into a terrible spiral of fragmented death and destruction with no relief in the end. I was just glad it was over.
2,Weird...,"Not her greatest stuff, Laurell should probably stick to vampires and faeries. The writing style was below average, and the plot just wasn't very interesting, though it did have its moments."
1,Have Not Been This Bored in Years,"I will keep this simple and brief; not since reading 'Interview with the Vampire' has a novel been so sleep inducing. Just like Anne Rice's bed-time tripe (and Planescape: Pages of Pain), I would reccomend this as toilet paper substitute."
1,This was the final one...,"A friend loaned me this book. She liked it. Because she liked it, I slogged through the entire [..] thing. It may be one of her first books, but it is most assuredly the LAST book by LKH I will ever read. It is slow, poorly written, and leaves so many loose ends dangling you would think an afghan got caught in a tornado. The only redeeming quaility this book can [..], as near as I can tell, is that LKH hasn't yet had time to [..] out the female lead. (Ala Anita Black, paranormal [..]"
1,"The pain, the pain!","Wow. What an incredible waste of paper.I have never read any of Hamilton's books before, and after reading Death of a Darklord, I don't know that I ever will. To say this was slow was an understatement. I have never seen so much dull, pointless exposition and interior monlogue in my life as I saw in these pages. I didn't even make it to the end--I was that bored by this novel.My opinion: go read one of P.N. Elrod's Strahd novels, if you want to read in Ravenloft."
5,Outstanding,This book was very well written. I am a huge Laurell K Hamilton fan and as always she delivers a great story.
1,NO! NO! NO!,Please God don't waste your time with this ! Any other Laurell K. Hamilton read and enjoy but not this one! I am a major fan but I'm afraid my copy of this is going in the bin!
2,No Hope,"***SPOILERSOkay, I feel entitled to be in rant mode because I just bought this book today and was determined to finish it before I went to bed. And for what? A pointless ending. The whole book seemed to be building around the trust between Jonothan and Elain and the end just suddenly sweeps all of the main characters to the side as if they were nothing (by either killing them off or ruining their lives). I mean, I'm glad Calum got his just reward in the end, but I felt like the whole body of the book was just....thrown away."
1,Booo!,I was so disappointed in the conclusion of this book. After reading the Anita Blake series where this regular girl gets out of every unlikely and devastating situation it just seemed wrong. I expected the girl to come into her magic and do lots of things. It's almost pointless that she had magic in the first place cause she didn't do anything significant with it and yet the story revolves mostly around her. What a waste of a good idea.
1,What is this?!?,"I generally avoid book series based on consumer goods, but I made an exception for Laurel Hamilton. I was extremely disappointed! I don't think I'm simply spoiled by the rich character development in her Anita Blake books. Hamilton does action & tension well enough, but the plot...where was it going? Why introduce the reader to characters, then sloppily kill them off? It was like a really bad made-for-TV movie on paper. I finished the book only because I though Hamilton would redeem herself. She failed."
1,What Happened?,I read all of her other books so far but what happened here? I was sorely disappointed. This was not only a truly depressing read but nothing was resolved and it felt incomplete.
1,Don't waste the effort to get excited,"ok..I realize this was a rerelease of an early novel..all I can say is Thank whoever needs to be thanked that LKH has improved her writing. The plot fizzles, the characters are poorly developed, and there is minimal explainations of why things happened. I was excited to read a LKH while waiting on the next Gentry novel..excited then dissappointed."
2,is this it???,"A dark, foreboding land of fear and death. What a scene! That is, until you read the book. I found that the story followed the life of a much gifted young woman and her adopted family. The main backbone of the plot was the family's inability to accept differences in others. I have not read many horror books (this being my first and last) and have found the genre not worth my time. This book is quite a let down after reading Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake books. It lacks a leading character and a plot. The only saving grace of this book would be Ms. Hamilton's writing style. Still, it is not a book I would invest my time in again if I had the chance."
1,Regret reading this book,"This is one of two books I have ever read that I regret reading. The other one involved incest and I think I dislike this book even more than the other. It's got some typical Hamilton elements: angry characters, gross, slimy and undead creations, and dark scary scenery. What is especially disappointing is the utter lack of anything remotely joyful, or happy, or even positive in the ending. Hamilton gives you all these characters, just begins to develop them so you start to care about them - then ruins every single one with the most depressing, unhappy ending possible.I was hopeful up until the very end because it seemed we were at the VERY least going to get a satisfying ending to the love story. Nope, killed that, too.Come on, Hamilton. Give us something!I'm sorry I read this book. It left me feeling depressed and disappointed. I wish I'd never picked it up. I wish I could erase it from my memory."
2,"Huge LKH fan, but this book sucked","I'm a huge Laurell K. Hamilton fan, but I found this book to be hard to get into, draggy and the characters to be not very interesting. I forced myself to finish the book and almost wish I hadn't. The ending sucked!I don't know this story was just really dark and unappealing.Would not recommend at all.The only reason I gave the story two stars is because it's obvious that Laurell is a good writer, even in the midst of a really bad story."
2,Love Laurell but not this book,I enjoy reading Laurell's books except for this one. Just could not get into it and the story was so-so to me. I will stick with her Anita and Merry books.Debra
2,Not so hot,"The premise is intriguing, but it just isn't up to her usual standard. Really loose plotting and lots of unresolved questions and issues at the end. It felt like I was missing something, like there was some background story I just didn't know, so it was not very satisfying. I didn't HATE it, but I really can't recommend it either."
2,This book is abridged,"I purchased this book believing that I was getting a new edition of the classic Eric Knight children's book. This book is a picture-book version of that classic, and the text is considerably abridged. The pictures are absolutely lovely, but they cannot, in my opinion, make up for the loss of the wonderful details, the dialogue, and the glorious description that the original contained. I applaud the editors for wanting to bring back a classic, but they would have done well to consider what made the book a classic in the first place."
5,Beautifully illustrated. Timeless classic.,"Bought this for my niece. Had to get another for myself, I liked it so much. This is the way children's books should be. Better for older child maybe 6 (if read to by an adult) and up."
5,Deserves its status as a classic,"Still an interesting, emotion-provoking and relevant read for the 21st century's jaded youth. It's about the most basic kind of friendship and loyalty, where an animal exhibits more of both than do the humans. Some of the Depression-era references and rigid class distinctions probably aren't as relevant today, but the core of the book, the love of and for an animal, remains. Highly recommended."
5,OUTSTANDING!!,"Why has it taken me so long to read this excellent book! It is not just a ""children's"" book. One of the best books I have read in a long time!"
1,BAD,This is a very old book. The cover and pages were yellowed. It is a chapter book--not suitable for a 4 or 5 year old. We have other Lassie books that are individual stories. My grandchildren love those. They did not care for this book. Too high in price.
5,"Seals and Vikings, oh my!","What the heck do you expect from Sandra Hill - anything less than excellence?As usual, an awesome Viking/Navy Seal adventure just waiting for you to buy it, take it home and treat it right - read it!! But pay attention: this is a fantasy so don't expect reality; suspend belief (such as ""there is no such thing as time travel"") and just ENJOY the book. If you don't like fantasy, don't buy then review the book in a negative; that's not fair. Warning: sex scenes are R but story line is hysterical and wonderful!"
3,Two novels in one,"This actually seems like two separate novels. The first section describes Victoria, a spoiled woman who's mother leaves her father for a libertine. The first Volume and a half describe her life and her attempts at becoming her own woman. But the telling is quick and boring. The second half tells of only a few months of Victoria's life, and her strange love for Zofloya, the moorish servant of her husband's brother. Fromt his point on, the novel becomes a harrowing tale of murder and revenge. Intensely violent, and very entertaining, the second half almost makes of for the rather lackluster beginning."
5,Great Women's Writing,This was a required book for an undergrad class. The author is a great writer and the book was of decent quality.
4,Makes Koi Pond cleaning easier,"We add this to our pond water several times during the spring, summer, and fall. It helps break down the waste making clean up alot easier."
4,If Salem had a soundtrack...,"Tight, solid Pacific NW surf(ish?) rock with a just-ever-so-slightly funhouse, carnival-gone-awry vibe behind it all. Excellent live band (black capes and white jeans) and a great album. Grab this for your next haunted Hawaiian Halloween party or any party. Killer road trip music."
5,Must have for counted thread enthusiasts,"Don't be fooled into thinking this is just a cross-stitch guide, though much of the discussion is about cross stitch. Counted thread work of all kinds are included in this book. It's wonderful!If you love counted cross stitch, Hardangar, etc., this book is for you. Clear pictures and easy-to-understand descriptions of the stitches demonstrated make it a reference book of value. The reviews of different types of fabric and stitching fibers is an added joy. The design types are wonderful.Don't hesitate to get this marvelous book, you'll be glad you did!"
4,Good book for beginner or advanced cross-stitcher,I have done cross stitching for years and still learned alot of interesting things from this book. Would also be great for first time beginners.
3,Hmmmm,"I was disappointed by this book, and I'm still not exactly sure why. It was definitely informative, and did show several good methods for adjusting my dogs. But it assumed a lot of technical and anatomical knowledge that I'm sure the majority of potential readers does not have, and in fact even with my own fairly in-depth canine knowledge I felt uncomfortable with many of the techniques, especially the one that starts with a disclaimer about how risky it is, says ""do not attempt this at home"" and then goes right on to detail how to do it.I guess my impression was that the book was really written by a vet for other vets, under the guise of being aimed at the general public. There is a lot of soapboxing in it, too, about how vets aren't allowed to practice chiropractic and chiropractors aren't allowed to practice on animals... and while this, if still true, definitely sucks - I didn't buy the book to read about it!"
1,canine chiropractic,"It was ok but I would not buy it again. It had nothing on use of an activator, Chiropractic tool."
4,Pretty good book,"This book is pretty good for the pet owner that is interested in the well being of their pet. I agree with other reviewers that the jargon used in this book may be difficult to understand if you are not familiar with chiropractic. The only downside to the book is a little bit of ranting and conspiracy theory done by the author that gets a little old, but it is not that big of a downer. Altogether, this is an excellent book and provides some excellent information."
4,Make sure The Well Adjusted Dog is in your reference library,"As a show dog owner of an active dog that needed chiropractic care as a pup, I am pleased to know that I can now maintain my dog's health with maintenance adjustments. I have been able to avoid 7 hour round trips to a chiropractic veterinarian by using the simple techniques that Dr. Daniel Kamen illustrates in this book.Every serious pet owner and veterinarian should have this book."
2,Vegas Baby,"I live in Las Vegas. I was excited to find a book on desert gardening. But this book was a disappointment.It is limited in content. A handful of veggies, fruits, flowers and herbs. Nothing that explains the difference one finds with desert gardening. The only thing that made it a desert gardening book was advice on planting time. This could have been accomplished on a single page. I know, because I had already downloaded a single page with the same data, for free, from an Arizona gardener.I've paid less for more information. Everything else, on plant care and soil, can be found in the other books I have purchased.There is no mention of container gardening, which is GREAT for those of us in Vegas with awful clay yards. Right now I am growing black kale in a GeoPot in my kitchen. I bring it in on our frigid nights, and put it out in the sun during the day."
5,Perfect book for a desert gardener,"I really love this book, it is perfect for the Arizona gardener. It's more like an instruction manual, you can't go wrong with this book."
4,Organic gardeners: I recommend this read!,"Excellent book. Needed it for an organic gardening class, and I think it is a book I will read and continue to reference even after the class is over. My only problem is that the binding- spiral- comes loose from the pages and it is irritating. Other than that I like even the way it is bound because it makes it easy to leave open and reference."
5,Very nice telling of Mel's story,"This book really showed me how good Mel was as a player and as a person. He was my great uncle, and although I never got to meet him (since he died before I was born), this book provided me with a great opportunity to learn more about him and how he lived his life. I recommend this book to any Mel Ott enthusiast or just about anybody who likes baseball, as it tells about one of baseball's best players and best people."
1,TOO HEAVY!!!,"When I saw this I thought it would be great to get those Christmas cookies off the tray quickly. It is soooo heavy I can't use it. I have offered it to my baking friends but as soon as the pick it up they don't want it. The blade could be so much thinner. Great idea, bad construction."
2,Weak Treatment of the Subject,"I have a great respect for Dr. Towns, but I do not feel he has addressed this issue in a helpful way. Rather than analyzing the dynamics of why a church experiences a worship war, he instead describes differing worship styles among various congregations. He only gives a passing treatment of why a worship war begins within a church body, and what can be done to diffuse it or to discourage it.I recommend ""America's Worship Wars"" by Terry York instead of this title by Towns. Towns provides interesting reading, but the best treatment by far is given by York."
4,Rockin Album,"Sugar Shack's 'Five Weeks Ahead of My Time'is the group's most rockin album yet. All fourteen songs keep you grooving. Tracks such as 'Thee Crusaders', 'I Can't Satisfy', and 'Blabbermouth' are great if you want to hear something something upbeat and fun. Anyone who is into ska or punk should definately check out this release. If you like Sugar Shack and this album, I advise looking into Camper Van Beethoven and Some Velvet Sidewalk, two other ska-punk bands. 'Five Weeks Ahead of My Time' is a must have."
2,Rip off,This is just as flimsy as the less expensive models. No bag included for stones and hinges broke off the first week.
4,Train to Asylum,"This is one of the best movies Gene Hackman has made. An excellent thriller. He plays the part of a deputy D.A. trying to bring a witness back to court in the U.S. but is being tracked by killers. Some beautiful scenery in Canada as he spirits his witness from a cabin and takes her to the train that will wind through the countryside. The action is non-stop with a helicopter chasing them shooting machine guns to the men hunting them on the train. A game of cat and mouse aboard the train is tense. It has you wondering who exactly is after her, and who are just passengers. Great cast with many familiar faces. Reminds you a little of a Hitchock style like ""The Lady Vanishes"". I highly recommend it. The DVD doesn't have much in the way of features but subtitles. Good quality picture and sound. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch ""The Package"" and ""Enemy of the State""."
4,Narrow Margin,Not as suspenful as the original but more exciting. I like gene hackman in whatever he does!
3,Gene Rocks!!!,"Gene Hackman is surely one of the greatest living actors. Even in a film like Narrow Margin, Hackman rises above the material. The Plot - Woman sees murder, Woman flees. Hackman tracks her down and must bring her back to testify. The Twist is it all takes place on a train. The tension is so thick you can cut it with a knife. Hackmans character is a tough guy in the best sense of the word, not like a Stallone or a Swartzenegger character. We see and Feel Hackmans pain. Anne Archer is also fine as the Woman in question. Also with J.T and M.Emmett Walsh,And James B Seking. The Dvd has no extras but for the price it's not bad."
5,Sit on the edge of your seat movie!,Narrow Margin starring Gene Hackman and Anne Archer is a wonderful action and adventure movie and has some nail biting suspense aboard a train! This is definitely a movie I could watch again several times and not get bored with it!
3,More Suspense Please.,I was diapointed. I was expecting more of a Fugitive or Enemy of the State kind of movie. My 17 and 14 year old sons didn't finish watching with me because they thought it was to boring.The first part with the mountain cabin and helicopter chase was good. Once they were on the train it fizzled out.
2,takes you to the edge of suspense (but no further),"I saw this in the theater whe it came out. The ads said ""It takes you to the edge of suspense."" And it did, just to the edge, not to actual suspense, just the edge. Stick to Fleicher's noir classic."
5,Great movie,I would watch Gene Hackman read a phone book so maybe I am not the best judge but the movie was very exciting and fun to watch for me.
3,Adventure on a Train,"A claustrophobic thriller where a witness has to be protected from a set of killers on a moving train. The protagonist has to keep the witness alive to testify. A bit cliched at times, the movie does have its moments and keeps the momentum fast."
3,"Not too bad, could be better.","Like it's first series, Jubei-Chan 2 has the same feel. Short, fast fight sequences with a little too much stupid, kiddy comedy. Those looking for more sword play should look else where, but those who like more comedy with a little sword play here and their, this is a good one."
3,Don't throw your tapes away!,"I'm all for a five star rating of this set- having the second season all laid out on DVD, no rewinding or fast-forwarding to get to favorite scenes... it sounded perfect. That is, until I flicked straight to one of my all-time, bookmark-it-now scenes in the second episode and found that the song was completely different and nowhere near as good.For a show that based so much of the emotional impact in the music and had such great songs for key scenes, I find it crazy that they have been changed. Cost cutting, rights wrangling, explain it how you will, I just felt like I was watching a cheap, ""lite"" version of the show that I loved and it has definitely suffered for it. Think of the patented Joey Potter roll-of-the-eyes when you see this modification listed in the ""Features"".Note to producers: Bring on Season 3 DVD, and please! leave the music alone!!"
5,SECOND SEASON IS AWESOME,"The episodes is season two are incredible. Dawson and Joey fist starting to date...ah! Even though it ended differently than I anticipated and hoped, I still LOVE this show! They'd be smart to release all 6 seasons on DVD because I WILL BUY THEM and I know others would as well. I highly recommend this DVD set!"
5,Some people are never happy with anything!,"For those of you unaware, music license's are extremely expensive. For a show to hold on to them five years would jack up the price of the DVD, so that only those fortunate enough to be wealty could afford to buy it. In order to serve the greater good, the intelligent producers of Dawson's Creek chose not to hold on to the license's and use new songs, which may not be as touching/nostalgic as the original songs, but have allowed the lesser fortunate to own their favorite show on DVD. I agree that songs are very important, but you can enjoy the story just the same, if you let go of your spoiled attitude."
1,"Never received the product. And the seller requested the refund, so I'll see if that refund comes through.","Never received the product. And the seller requested the refund, so I'll see if that refund comes through. It's not a very good experience. Any buyer would want to have received the product purchased instead of getting a refund."
3,Delivered fine...,"I didn't buy this for me... I bought it for my girlfriend at the time. I don't really enjoy the show, but it was shipped quickly and delivered safely. My ex enjoys it. Others will too. You can't really go wrong with the TV DVD box sets!"
1,Dawson's creek second season,Every disk on this DVD skips and the first disk wont even play. when I purchased this DVD it said it was in good condition. I am pretty disappointed that I was unable to watch all the episodes on the second season of Dawson's creek
2,dawson's crap,I could deal with some songs replaced in the show but some of the more poignant moments like in the SEcond season are ruined with replacement music. Like when Pacey and Tamar reunite or at the Dance. What is even more disgusting is the replacement of the Theme song in the third season dvd set. I hope this isn't the precedent for all Dawson's creek Dvd sets. Not highly recommended but sufficient enough to cure that Dawson's Creek fix.
4,Both Seasons of Dawson's Creek are good,"If you are a fan of the WB show ""Dawson's Creek"",then go out and get the DVDs that are out now. You can relive the days at good old Capeside High. Dawson as he goes through life as a teenager,Jen as she tries to get Dawson to loosen up,Jack as he goes through the perils of being a teenager, Joey as she wonder if she and Dawson will ever get together,Pacey as he tries to make a life for himself,and Andie as she tries to examine her new life of Capeside. If you like my review,go get the Dawson's Creek DVDs."
5,Its Not so Bad,"I just finished watching these discs last night. Bear in mind I never missed and episode when the show originally aired, I found the season to be great. I'm not real sure what the big deal is with the music change, there are songs that I liked from the original, however I found that the new music gave the DVD a fresh new sound. If the music is the only thing that people have a complaint too in this DVD set, then it tells me that the Producers of this show definitely did something right. For those people that cant seem to get over the musical change all 6 seasons are being aired on WTBS, buy a DVD recorder and record them yourself. Bring on Season 3, I cant wait."
2,upset,HI I was wondering when will I get it I been waiting a good while for it if you can please let me know
4,Amazing!,"I love this dvd!! There's even love for us Pacey Joey fans!!!! I recommend this, very much! :) There are many extras, that are well worth the 35 dollars itself! If you're a Dawson's Creek fan, definately buy this! :) I got it for christmas, and it's a great way to relive your favorite episodes! I've watched them all so many times. They never get old!"
5,Keep em comin,"Has anyone else noticed slightly dodgy menus when trying to select episodes? It may be my DVD player but I don't think so. To be honest I don't really believe the new songs detracted from the overall enjoyment of what is a great TV show but the original soundtrack wasn't broke so why try to fix it. The shows themselves are great, a must for any creek fan. Even with overly clever menus and tampered with soundtrack I still have to give the full 5 stars."
3,"Great show, but very upset with the changes......","I love this show. I purchased the DVD because these shows for some reason made me happy, they remind me of High Shcool, and taking trips to Wilmington. It is just a great warm show. 1/2 of the reason I find it so enjoyaable is the music. THe songs were curent with the time and still remind me of a few years back. I vividly remember sitting and watching hte music fit perfectly with the show. It was amazing. The DVD (due to legal reasons) shnged the music leaving a huge void. The show is sub-par without the original music. The pvital moments and music are now missing, making me not likely to watch the remainder."
4,GreenFree Clarifier,"This device is a wonder! Prior to its use, I constantly battled sun and minerals that kept the pond filled with algae. While chemicals work, they must contantly be adjusted in summer temperatures of 130 degrees in Basrah, Iraq. An added bonus is that all of the plant life in the pond is alive again. The five turtles and all of the fish can breathe again. I clean the filters each day and the pond is clear!!"
5,my 5 yr old checked it out so many times from the library that I had to buy it,When my son was 5 he wanted to check this book out from the library every time we went in there so I finally had to just buy it for him. Great pictures. Very entertaining and funny. Still one of my favorite books on his shelf.
4,A film that sticks out in my mind,This film is ver underated. I realise that people have complained about its apparent lack of real direction in terms of a plot development but it is a realistic look into the heart of a corrupt judiciary. Corruption in real life does not always involve a white house assistant / boy scout who uncovers a scandal that directly implicates the president as a murderer. Is film shows us the two faces of the story and aside from that the actors are superb. Watch out for Al Pacino's speech at the funeral.
2,CITY HALL,THE MOVIE WAS SOME WHAT BORING IN THE BEGINNING. IT PICKS UP IN THE MIDDLE. GOOD ACTING DONE BY PACINO AND CUSACH. THE ENDING WAS NOT GOOD AT ALL. IT WAS A BIG LET DOWN. I FELT SHORT CHANGED.
1,City Hall,"Not even Pacino can save this bad attempt at political drama. ""Boring"" is the only word to describe it -- from beginning to end. Actually, I can't attest to the ending. I saw this film when it came out and I walked out of the theatre about an hour into the movie because it was so dreadful."
4,City Hall,"Roughly based on real events in the 1980s when Ed Koch was mayor. A solid film and a step up from another John Cusack political drama, the decent but yuppie-themed ""True Colors."" Cusack's character is the deputy mayor of NYC, aka the ambitious mayor's,(Al Pacino) right hand man. A shooting in Brooklyn leaves three people dead which culminates into a Willie Horton type legal & media crisis for the mayor's office. Cusack teams up with Bridget Fonda, a lawyer for the detectives endowment fund to perform due diligence only to find their digging ends up too close to home. Danny Aiello does a good job as a complicated yet sympathetic Brooklyn councilman; Martin Landau as a bent new york supreme court judge and former law partner of the mayor; Richard Schiff as a probation supervisor; and David Paymer as a top city hall advisor. Snappy intelligent dialogue, Pacino is rarely better.""The only thing new in this world is the history you don't know."" ~ Harry Truman"
5,How to make a sow's ear into a silk purse,"What is more hackneyed than a plot regarding corruption in municipal politics? Hard to think of anything. However, an assortment of behind the camera workers put into the hands of an excellent cast the tools whereby they were able to create a satisfying human drama. Action there is, but it does not overwhelm the story of how people deal with each other. Al Pacino sets the tone not only by his own performance but by his influence on the entire web of relationships. Danny Aiello is excellent as a political boss while the brief appearances of Martin Landau and Tony Franciosa are like the few strokes of a masters brush which firmly sketch a character. Though there are moments which seem to be diversions from dramatic logic, they are minor flaws in a good product."
3,Simple recipes,"This is a reasonable low priced gift to give someone because of:*It's low cost ($4 or less on Amazon)*Many recipes, each with a color photo*Each recipe has ""how to do"" photos (usually 3)*Each recipe lists calories, protein, carbs, sugars, fat and saturates, in grams, for those keeping track*Recipes that are low in calories, protein sugars etc are less easy to find, and someone is bound to find a handful of goodies in this.It weighs about 5 pounds or more, so set this monster down when reading it!I've not cooked from this as I love my carbs, sugars, fats, etc. (!) however the recipes I've read are simple and should be reasonably tasty. This is not complicated gourmet cuisine; this is simple food that should taste good, for those on select diets, with helpful photos, suitable for beginning to intermediate cooks."
1,Don't be DECEIVED!!!,"If you want to make low fat-food, don't waste your money here. This cookbook claims in 2 inch type to have 1000 LOW FAT recipes. It does NOT. In fact, almost *NONE* of the recipes are low fat -- yes, previous reviewer, they don't taste low fat because they are, in fact, mostly HIGH FAT! These recipes call for whole milk, multiple tablespoons of butter, sour cream, and get this: ""full-fat cheese."" A typical recipe from this book has 20 - 30 g of fat per serving (and one even has 49g fat/ 614 calories -- that's 441 calories out of 614 from fat!). Given that the medical community recommends a max of 65g per DAY, well, eat one of these you get rice cakes for the rest of the day.As someone who must eat low-fat for health reasons, I can't eat anything from this cookbook. Stay away from it if you care about fat content!"
1,Misleading,"This book is extremely heavy, in fact too heavy for daily use in the kitchen. I thought the title was misleading...I felt the recipes were not low salt, fat, sugar and cholesterol."
1,Muhammad Ali: the greatest,I was disappointed in this movie poor poor quality. skipped. its a shame because he is an was a great man.(i didnt see it before i gave feedback). passport did a poor transfer to dvd. there are better dvd`s out there.
5,Handmade Journal/Scrapbook,"This is a well-crafted journal made from all natural products. I was very satisfied with almost every aspect of this journal. I would recommend this very unique journal/scrapbook for anyone wanting something special, unique, and very well made."
2,Old story.,"Back Cover description: Iris Ardath, abandoned in infancy, had spent all her life behind the convent walls of St. Clare's. She fully expected that she would take the veil and spend her years safe in the quiet cloisters.But Mother Superior decided that Iris needed to know something of the world first. So she sent her to be governess for Aleko, son of the vibrant, worldly, sophisticated Zonar Mavrakis.Love was something for others. Iris was sure of it-until she was thrust into the life of this powerful by lost and lonely man.Sort of Sound of Music with one child and no humor. She's innocent, there is a nasty chauffer who attacks her and somewhat boring plot. Copyright of book I read was 1980."
4,"A fun, thoughtful, beautiful, creative and moving jazz Christmas CD","Laura Caviani is an excellent pianist and a fantastic arranger who excels at combining her deep musical knowledge with and open and soulful heart.I've seen her play in person many times and own each of her CDs (check out ""Going There"" - great!) and, unlike many talented live performers, she's able to capture her gifts in the studio so that we can all enjoy them at home.This is a special Christmas CD with a wide variety of tunes, interpretations and instrumentation. It works as a sensitive Christmas performance with some spice along with a sense of humor (that's Laura C in a nutshell for me!).Enjoy this CD - I do!"
1,Huge Bubble,"The bubble is 2x the size of the hashmarks it is supposed to fit into... I lost my packing slip so I didn't return it. Sitting on shelf in garage, never used."
2,Not so great,"Temperamental to say the least! I tried this product on many different types of labels and it only works on a few and inconsistently at that. Rather disappointed, I will go back to soaking my labels off."
4,Label lift,"The product works much better than most that are on the market. There was one that I found in Japan that was more tenacious at removing the label, but it is not impoted to the U.S.A"
5,Nice Product,"I used two of other product, and this one was much better.If you looking for a label remove i whould recomend this oneLuiz Carvalho, Sao Paulo Brazil"
5,Works well and easy to use,We have gone through a couple boxes of these label lifters and every one of them has worked correctly and nicely laminated the wine label. We will definitely buy again!
2,Wine Label Remover,The adhesive works on some labels but doesn't work well on any labels that have foil or metallic in them.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I was so excited about the prospect of saving my labels. This product does not work. I have tried numerous times on different wine bottles and have had absolutely no success. Save your money and soak your bottles in water.
4,"Tricky, but they do work","All right, I have had difficulties in using these when first starting out, but they do what they are supposed to do.First off, wait until you are sober to try and do this as they are sticky. Don't do this immediately after you have been drinking the wine or you will have problems because the labeloff wasn't on properly.Secondly, make sure the labeloff is on properly. That means stuck totally to the label. Not wadded up or with air bubbles.You will want to use a knife to get any bubbles out and make sure the labeloff is on the wine label.Thirdly, wait a few minutes before removing the labels.Another suggestion is to use a single edged razor blade to help lift off an edge of the label. Go underneath the label with the blade to make it easier to remove the labels.Sure, it is work, but it is the best way to remove labels now that vintners are making them harder to get off and save.Also, you will need to use them a few times before you get the hang of these."
1,"This is a great story, but...","The story is pretty good, but paying 4 dollars for an ebook that is filled with the same errors and lack of pagination as the free Project Gutenberg version is ridiculous. What a waste of money..."
3,A little bizzare,"I have enjoyed many of John Buchan's novels: The Thirty Nine Steps, John McNab, Huntingtower (especially amusing), The Island of Sheep. But this Richard Hannay novel is rather strange, involving the use of hypnotism as a means to gain political power. Most of his novels are rather far-fetched, but fun. I'd give this one a miss though. Really out-there!"
3,"""You have one little mid-air and you never hear the end of it.""","The life of New York City air traffic controller Nick Falzone (John Cusack) is stressful enough until super controller Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton) arrives. Nick gets a little too close to Russell's wife Mary (Angelina Jolie, who met future ex-hubby Thornton on the set of this film) and hijinks ensue. A number of scenes show the controllers at work, although real controllers no doubt spend much more time looking at their screens than the characters in this movie. Watch for the scenes that show how Russell has a special fondness for wake turbulence."
3,Amazing Cast-Mediocre Movie,"Pushing Tin was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Angelina Jolie, and Cate Blanchett among others!The movie sheds light on a New York air traffic controller who seems to have it all, but whose life takes a sharp turn for the worst from the moment a new transfer arrives to work by his side...The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.The acting is pretty good (though nothing great), while the humor and the plot are just about average.Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really...In a nutshell, it's an ok movie, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top. No masterpiece here.If a Billy Bob Thornton movie is what you're looking for, check out Monster's Ball.If John Cusack is what you had in mind, check out Serendipity."
4,Pushing Tin was great!,"If you are looking for a different movie, with no violence and some good humor, then rent Pushing Tin. Pushing Tin is about an air traffic control who is going through a mid life crisis. This movie is really neat and different. And it focuses on something other then violence."
3,A controllers view,"As a controller, most of the air traffic scenes within the approach control were well researched. I felt like I was inside a IFR room where the real controlling takes place. The characters personalities were about the way real controllers are, at least at my facility. The plot line was a little off. No controller would plug into position and start working airplanes without first bieng trained and watched by a rated controller, but this is hollywood. And no person, controller or not, would be allowed onto a active runway while a jet is landing. All in all, it was a good film that gives a very realistic view into our unusual and misunderstood profession."
1,losing interest quickly,"the first part of the movie was interesting but waiting for it to get to ""uproariously contest of wit"" as described on the DVD box quickly became tiresome. The plot was weak, the acting rather wooden. Even Jolie (fatuously) could not spark this one into a great movie. I wanted a pin to deflate those blubberly lips of hers. And the scene in the pilot's cabin? How ridiculous and fairy tale fantasy. I guess you have to love all the players in order to truly enjoy this one."
1,CRASH AND BURN!,"If your a pilot like me and enjoy a good plane flick, this is not the movie for you. Besides Cate Blanchette being a hotty there is nothing to this movie. Not only is there very little quality aviation related material, it glorifies controllers as hip, hard drinking, cool guys. Give me a break."
2,Pushing Tin DVD,"I was very disappointed when I popped this DVD into my player. It was permanently set at a very wide-screen version, so I had huge black bars on the top and bottom of the screen - if you put the two black bars together, they would equal a bigger area than that of which the movie was playing in. I felt like I was watching a big rectangle with moving parts and voices instead of a movie. I went into the menu and tried all three settings, and the viewing area stayed the same. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!"
1,Insulting drivel. No intelligent person should endure this.,"This film is set in a bizarre fantasy world which vaguely resembles Earth. Supposedly mature adults with extremely important job responsibilities behave like emotional retards and/or felons. The characters are, barely, two-dimensional. The ending sequence, where Cusack's character blackmails a pilot into summoning a passenger to the cockpit of a commercial jetliner, is perhaps the stupidest scene I have ever witnessed in a major motion picture. God-awful stuff. Avoid, avoid, avoid!"
5,Umpteen number of plot twists,I just finished watching it and I thought it was great. The cinematics are great of the airplanes plus it was funny whenever the wake turbulence hits and they get ragdolled.
1,Pushing Tin is NOT a comedy,"Pushing Tin is most definitely NOT a comedy despite the studio's wish to put it in that category. But then what are they going to say: ""This is a moderately depressing drama about the morbid competition between two air traffic controllers that nearly destroys both of them and their families""?"
2,"Good, but too long and not the ""comedy"" that's expected","John Cusack, Billy Bob Thorton, and Angelina Jolie star in this dramedy about two traffic controllers who are having rivarly over who's better at traffic controlling, sex, etc. Starts of kind of slow, but onces Thorton enters the picture it starts to get interesting. Then somewhere in the middle it gets lost again and doesn't pull itself up till the end. It's an up and down movie which is why it only gets 2 stars."
2,A waste of a good premise.,"What might have been an interesting and quirky exploration of the hidden subculture of air traffic controllers instead turns into a meandering, lost story that never decides what it wants to be. John Cusack is pretty much his reliable self in a nice-guy role that has become a cliche for him. Only Billy Bob Thornton's memorable performance redeems the film."
1,Thought this would be a good flying movie for aviation fans - bad choice.,"While there is some relevance to aviation, and some humor sprinkled throughout, the overriding theme was more about people having affairs with co-worker's spouses. We turned it off about half way through."
2,Not a great Cusack movie :/,"I've been a John Cusack fan since I was a kid and this movie is not his best, I will never watch it again. The plot was lame, the writing was poor, and his character was unlikable. Not recommended."
4,Pushing Tin,When I bought this movie it was to replace the one I lost. I enjoyed the film and wanted another one. The actors are fun and I have never seen one with Jolie and Billy Bob Thorton together so it was great. Whoever get this movie will enjoy it. Great condition and fast service.
2,Montana ceded to Europe?,I received my ordered movie in a timely manor. The problem was it had a European region code and was not comparable with my Blu-Ray in the U.S. A quick call to the capital in Helena confirmed the state had not in fact ceded to Europe which I took as a bonus. :) I received credit for the movie minus shipping. Not thrilled with partial credit but given my many purchases through Amazon this last purchase was an exception and not a rule. I will continue an already long relationship with Amazon.
3,A must see for Pilots & the FAA,Saw the movie at a pre-release opening in Washington...It was entertaining & fun and had a special appeal for all us pilots who were able to see a more 'mature' (sic) side to the ATC system.
3,An Okay Movie,"I just got this movie and just finished watching it. Having enjoyed Director Mike Newell's previous effort in 4 Weddings and A Funeral, and always enjoying John Cusacks performances, it doesn't let down on that front. Also you have to like Billy Bob Thornton and Cate Blanchett who deliever.For such a stellar cast, though, the script is noticably lacking. It could have been a brilliant movie. Instead it's just enjoyable but unmemorable. Rent it, don't bother buying."
2,Disappointing,"I rented the movie due to it's great cast, and the promising premise. However, it was very disappointing, the movie left me saying ""so what?"". The acting was excellent, and there were some great scenes, but it was incredibly boring and silly. This movie is only worth watching if you have some time to kill."
4,Entertaining glimpse into lives of Air Traffic Controllers!,"This was a well made movie about co-worker rivalry, spousal infidelity, and the high energy stress and pace of Air Traffic Controllers all wrapped into one. The all star cast consists of John Cusack, Cate Blanchett, Billy Bob Thornton, and Angelina Jolie, and they all shine! Dialogue is often fast and direct, which reflects the attributes of an Air Traffic Controller's life, and helps to keep the movie moving along at an interesting pace."
3,Title Should be 'when bad things happen to good people',"This is a good film, funny in parts, but you find yourself wanting to see more antics in the the control room. Still, it is a movie worth renting. You'll buy it only if you have friends who are into flying..."
3,John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton make it all better,"The plot is kind of ho-hum, but I'm glad to see Hollywood address the fact that one sexual indiscretion - adultery in this case - can cause a lot of damage and grief.The strong point of the movie is the humor. It is funny. Lots of good lines and lots of interesting scenes. I sat down and watched it because my daughter had brought it home from the video store and I thought ""Ah, I'll give it 10 minutes."" It drew me in quickly and held my rapt attention.It's a great movie to see. But I think a rental would suffice. As a prior reviewer said, I wouldn't buy this one. It's not a movie you'd watch over and over again.More of a ""few days in the life of two controllers"" than any deep moving plot.But it is a lot of laughs.BTW, I never knew you could do that thing they do with Jet wash. It does look a wee bit dangerous, though."
4,New Kid In Town,"John Cusak plays the star air-traffic controller in a facility near New York City. Star in this macho world until Billy Bob Thornton shows up with his formula of about fifty percent zen and fifty percent testosterone and blows him and everyone else out of the water. The ensuing rivalry takes on professional, personal and even romantic overtones in this engrossing comedy-drama.I watched ""Pushing Tin"" on two levels. It was insightful in the way it charts the male obsession with being and remaining number one. On the other hand it scared the hell out of me to think that anyone like these guys are responsible for getting my plane out of the air and onto the runway safely! Let's hope this fiction is mostly what it is--fiction--and enjoy the movie for what it is, an enjoyable macho fantasy and a good (but not great) time at the movies."
1,SOFT PUSH,"John Cusack. Angelina Jolie. Billy Bob Thornton. Cate Blanchett. Jake Weber. How did such good actors get in such a lifeless, pointless movie? Basically nothing more than a testosterone competition between Thornton and Cusack, the movie isn't funny and its dramatic attempts fail because the characters are so shallow and unlikeable. Director Mike Newell blew this one, folks."
4,Fans of offbeat comedies need only apply!,"I repeat, if and ONLY if you like (or interested in seeing) offbeat comedies, see Pushing Tin. People who like regular comedies will most likely think this is a strange movie.The best way to describe this film is to say its a dark comedy. The two lead characters are competitive air traffic control operators. They spend the majority of the film playing a twisted version of 'anything you can do, I can do better', with hilarious results.While the film does has funny momments, its not 'roll on the floor' humor, its more subtle. If you have a quirky sense of humor, give this film a try. If you're sense of humor is normal, you may not like it."
2,What a waste of a great cast,"John Cusack is the best air traffic controller at one of the world's busiest airports, but when small town sensation Billy Bob Thornton shows up and turns out to be an even greater virtuoso of the radar screen, Cusack tries to compete with him (not only at work, but for Thornton's wife) and ultimately has a breakdown.None of this is particularly funny, or dramatic, or interesting. The two leads are fine, considering the material, but Angelina Jolie is wasted, as are several other supporting cast members of note. The end product is uninspired."
2,COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER,Pushing Tin starts out great. It captures the very true-to-life quirkiness of air traffic controllers. John Cusack is totally believable in this role. And Cate Blanchett is amazing as his wife. However after Billy Bob Thornton appears on the scene as a rival air traffic controller with his voluptuous alcoholic wife (played by his now real life wife Angelina Jolie) things take a turn for the worse. The competition between Cusack and Thornton's characters gets to the point of being ridiculous and dangerous. Their infidelities and personal problems are just too out there. This film missed the mark but had really stellar beginnings. It could have been so much better.
1,One of the worst films I have ever seen,"This is one of the worst films ever made. I kept waiting for the film to end. The first 20 minutes are interesting-you see how traffic controllers work in their high stress enviornment. Aside from that, the film was badly cast. Other than air traffic controllers, I cant imagine anyone liking this film."
3,Pushing Tin 2009 DVD,"I purchased this new release of Pushing Tin because the 1999 version was not Anamorphic widescreen and 2:31:1, very annoying on a widescreen monitor. I had hoped that the new version was being released in Anamorphic widescreen, but to my disappointment; it was not. Besides a few new extras, the DVD is EXACTLY the same as the 1999 version. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING THIS DVD AS I DID!"
2,Couldn't wait for it to be over,"This is one of those flicks that had me changing the display on the DVD player from ""Elapsed Time"" to ""Remaining Time.""As I pilot, I found the ATC communications to be refreshingly authentic, although I can't vouch for the behavior of the controllers. (And I most certainly hope that the previous reviewer was kidding when he said the portrayal of the TRACON environment was realistic.)The whole plot drags on and on, without much in the way of twists or diversions. The characters are flat, despite the best efforts of the actors, and the script is bland in addition to being fairly unbelieveable.I gave this one two stars only because I was able to stomach watching it all the way through, although I can't say I enjoyed it. I can't even recommend a rental here.If you're a Cusack fan, you'd be better off buying ""One Crazy Summer."""
1,Incredibly Weak,"I started this book with not too many hopes, I was just passing the time really. I was enjoying the book up until about the last two chapters. The story switched paces far too abruptly for my taste. It didn't develop the relationships between Lucy and her two 'beaus' well enough. Suddenly she realized that she actually didn't like her boyfriend when in fact one chapter ago she was perturbed that he would be looking at another girl. Then in the last chapter she just goes off with the actual guy she likes. It never concludes anything, I have a pit in my stomach from reading this book. I feel like it is not complete and there should be some finality to the story, the author gave the impression of a conclusion, but nothing concrete. Overall I found this book entirely disappointing."
1,thanks for perpetuating a stereotype,"Wow. thanks for perpetuating the stereotype of the wicked stepmother, right off the bat from your title to your storyline. hopefully the author never marries a man who has children...or maybe she should, so she can be labeled with a stereotype whether it applies to her or not."
3,"Fluff read, little character development","When Lucy moves from San Fransisco to New York because of her dad's marriage to her step-monster Mara, Lucy's dad still commutes back and forth for work, Lucy is left alone with Mara and her twin daughters and relegated to sleep in the basement without furniture. When Lucy catches the attention of a popular basketball star, it seems like her life is truly a fairy tale come true. As Lucy gets to know Sam, a fellow artist, she must decide if she wants a fairy tale or real love.This book is a light, fun read, but I felt the end was rushed. The storyline is interesting although predictable, but the characters never really grabbed my attention. I liked Lucy but didn't really care about the other characters, including the ""prince"" who captures her heart.I received this book in exchange for my review. My thoughts and opinions are my own."
4,the best kind of trash,"...and everybody's got to read trash sometime. Extremely predictable, but well written and witty. I read it, expecting it to be Ziegestar-ish, and was pleasantly surprised. Definitely several cuts above the It and Clique books, and not at all nauseating."
4,Expensive but works great,"The option is expensive, but works really well - exacly as advertised. Very easy and straight forward to setup and delivers the contents well. The complaint I have is a philosphical one - why not allow the standard HDMI connector / connections instead of the proprietary gadget for HD contents? It seems Sling Media just wants to nickel and dime us. However, this is their platform and they have the right to do it the way they want. What I can indeed say is that the gadget, albiet a bit expensive as comapred to perhaps just using a std HDMI option, works really well. If you can use it and can afford it, get..."
3,Nice addition but expensive,"This feature should have been built-in to the Slingbox Pro from the beginning. They now have a new model of the Slingbox that has these connections built-in along with 1080i upscaling. The Slingbox pro was supposed to be made for multiple connections and has an HDMI like connection but will not work unless this HD Connect is attached to it. A HDMI input/output connection on this dongle would have received a better review. Overall, I was not pleased with the PQ of the slingbox with this connection via PC or remote access and got rid of it."
5,Portabilty and extending,Get my cable anywhere on my wireless in my house. Great for on the road and pushes good streaming content to my phone
3,Sling Media HD Connect Cable,"I bought this along with Slingbox Pro, I understood that this piece was needed to obtain HD quality broadcasts on my laptop from Slingbox. It works fine, I have a co worker who connected his without this piece (he doesn't have HD at home) and it looked as good as mine. Also this piece takes the HD port on my Cablebox/DVR so I have to connect my HDTV with Component cables, needless to say, My home TV viewing suffers, so I disconnect my slingbox when at home. Price is better on Amazon than CC or BB."
1,Not very good at their intended job,"These seem to have a really hard time staying stuck to the tub, and don't seem to provide much grip. Not too inpressed so far..."
5,the only syrup I will eat on pancakes,"The only syrup I will eat on pancakes. Actually THICK. Why do they not sell this in stores? Came fast, well packed and I feel happy having this stocked. Only wish I could get the big 32 oz bottles."
1,Contains High-Fructose Corn Syrup,"I was really disappointed to see high-fructose corn syrup listed on the nutritional label. Like many IBS patients, I have Fructose Malabsorption, so I get very sick when I eat fructose.The ""Karo Light Corn Syrup"" is fructose-free and tastes great on pancakes. I'm surprised a company that boldly advertises the light corn syrup as""0G high-fructose corn syrup"" would put that ingredient in this product."
5,The Best Pancake Syrup!,This is the best pancake syrup ever invented! We can't find it anywhere here in Eastern KY so I am going to order it here on Amazon. Mmmmm...I can't wait until it gets here.
3,It started off well,"As a student of classicl liberal Economics and traditional Christianity I was extremely pleased to find a book that crosses the gap between Biblical thought and Government policy. The first half of the book was provocative and would be hugely beneficial for Christians and non-Christians alike to read. However, suddenly, on Pg 102, Dr. Cobin makes a ridiculous and shocking claim (with no evidence to back it up) that Greek Orthodox Christians belong to the Satan's Kingdom. Although it may be true that certain doctrines in any church have strayed from Biblical Christianity, it is going way to far to declare the entire Greek Orthodox Faith to be under the domain of Satan. With statements such as this, which try to rip apart denominations from Christainity, I question whether Dr. Cobin is in fact himself under the domain of Satan."
5,another Wolf keeper,"I love the early Regencies that Wolf wrote before moving to her longer, more ""successful"" novels set in the same era...this novel involves some of the same characters like David and Catherine from A London Season which adds to the enjoyment.I found her usual irony in the set up of what each expected from the marriage and a well-plotted (although I thought predictable) mystery...just a good read..."
2,double deception,"The book arrived in nasty dirty condition, a first w/amazon, and I order a lot of books.I wouldn't have read it even if had been in better shape."
5,Bonus track on Import version,Another great album from Orb! Just wanted to mention that the UK import version has an extra track inserted at #12 (EDM) which (IMO) is easily worth the extra cost.
3,"Not bad, but not great","The Orb was one of the first acts in electronic music I really got into. Their smooth, chilled ambience was a great soundtrack to just relaxing and being mellow. ""Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld"" was a great, great album, and ""U.F. Orb"" is an absolute masterpiece. So when I heard of new Orb on the way, I was very eager.Unfortunately, it wasn't as great as I had hoped. There are definite highlights, such as ""Once More"", ""A Mile Long Lump Of Lard"", ""Terminus"", ""Hamlet of Kings"", ""Centuries"", and ""Plum Island"", but there's a lot of filler too. It wouldn't have hurt to cut the length some. The production is wonderful, as always, but often it just disguises the emptiness that lies in the song.I'd still rank it above ""Orblivion"" because of its' more cheerful vibe, but it's not the best out there. Pick up their first two albums, the live disc, and the greatest-hits compilation first."
4,Still genius,"""I'm flying."" It gives me great happiness to say that The Orb are back (now as ""Orb"") with a really excellent piece of work. Luckily, and a little surprisingly, it sounds similar to earlier Orb -- maximalist, psychedelic dub verging on global deep house. This is progressive,creative, throbbing, profound, and playful music. I love it."
2,A great disappointment,"This is a far cry from the Orb that originally defined what has become dreamy, mellow trance. Whereas other artists have expanded and improved upon their genre, it seems on this disc that Orb is intent on ignoring the foundation they helped built to try out an amalgamation of new sounds. Within the first 10 seconds of listening to this CD I had a bad feeling about it, as I have in each subsequent attempt to listen to the album. If you thought Orblivion was their best, you'll probably get a lot of enjoyment out like this album more. But if you're like me and pine for a return to the rhythm and composition present on UFOrb and Ultraworld, this album is a real letdown."
4,The Orb Grows up...,"Yes, this is a very different album from previous efforts, boiling the tracks down into actual seperate pieces is new for Alex and shows an interest in traditional song structure. Still hillarious, still trippy, still catchy. Including actual (not sampled) vocalists is also quite a step.But what we tend to forget is that an Orb album, as good as it is by itself, also plays the role of providing fodder for the live shows which are always quite dense and intense. (and the point) I hope they come to America again, but I don't blame them if they don't. Best track: ""Mile Long Lump of Lard."""
4,Satisfying but not groundbreaking,"I have been a huge fan of The Orb since I first heard U.F.Orb in college. After a painfully long wait, Cydonia is FINALLY out. There is no doubt that this is the Orb within the first few seconds of track one. This is both a good and a bad thing. The frequent addition of breathy My Bloody Valentine-ish vocals is a nice surprise but for the most part, this is Orb by the numbers. There aren't any extreme stylistic surprises ala Pomme Fritze but, this is still a solid 68 minutes of great Orb tracks. There are some excellent spacey headphone tracks, great dub/house stuff, a smattering of drum and bass, the standard pallette of electronic music. The Orbs streangth in later years was playing with the electronic form and turning your expectations upside down. Cydonia doesn't carry as many of these moments but it is certainly well worth getting and sounds great."
2,the orb transformed into 2nd rate bjork,not the orb i used to know. listless and uninspired songs for one or more female vox who sound like bjork at her most sweetly straight. [in other words: bjork without bjork.] just nothing special here -- and i've always or nearly always loved the orb.
2,Clearly Misguided Effort Here,"Huh? What the hell is this? The Orb's latest effort is in my opinion its weakest. Gone are the amazing atmospherics of Outlands and U.F.Orb. Instead we have an entire cd of low-rent ambient, and in a day and age where most electro bands could easily play in place of one another, one expects more from the Orb. Growing old is hard, eh Alex? Like another reviewer, save your money unless you are looking to round out your Orb collection."
2,Disappointing,"To be brief . . . I couldn't wait for today's ""new release Tuesday."" Finally, a new Orb release. What a disappointment. This is completely unimaginative - not a single unique beat or sound. This release has a background similar to Pomme Fritz, but with sporadic, banal vocals (The Orb with melodic lyrics is just plain wrong). There is absolutely no reason to purchase this (except to round out your otherwise spectacular Orb collection). I give it two stars, because it has glimmers of hope on perhaps one or two of the thirteen tracks. You will find this soon in your local cut-out or used bin. I want my money back, and am very sad. I think I'll go home and listen to U.F.Orb now."
4,Lots of action & good characters.,"The mismatched FBI agents Sutton and Tanner (from Solemn Duty, a good read) are back in another enjoyable adventure. Stolen money, drug lords, the FBI and independent contractors all head for a big crash. All of Scott's books are good reads!"
5,I really enjoyed this book!,"""Duty Bound"" was the first Scott book I've ever read, and it was so good it inspired me to go out and read the rest of his books. The tense action sequences, witty banter between the characters, and intriguing plot made this a really good read. A tip: fans of the tv show ""The X-Files"" will probably enjoy this book."
5,Beautiful People,"Its a real good movie, I first saw it on the IFC channel...had to have it...if you watch it think out side the box and dont be to transcendental, it is a low budget high quality film"
3,"A Darker ""Love Actually""","Let me just start by saying that this is not a film for youngsters due it being rather graphic at times.Beautiful People just like Love Actually, brings to the screen a set of parallel stories that take place in London, England, involving an unlikely group of people who are linked to each other in varying ways. The actors carry out their performances well, though nothing extraordinary.In addition, it is much more tuned towards a European audience as opposed to an American one (this is not Hollywood).The plot is very witty, very well thought through, though it is slow at times and it could definitely have been executed better.It combines elements of comedy (surprisingly) and realistic drama (for a change), making this a movie worth watching.In short, Beautiful People is a movie that will make you both laugh and cry, and in the end leave you with enough ""food for thought"" as they say."
4,"Good, very good",... it's about these people in the london area that seem like they're not related directly but indirectly they are. The movie starts off pretty slow as you try and figure out who's who. It wasn't until the guy that took heroin and accidently got on a plane that took him to the war in bosnia instead of holland did the movie really [draw] me in. By the end of it you feel like you're a part of everyone's life. It's truly a very good film. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because of the slow start.
1,VHS transfer to DVD,Horrible rip-off by Artisan! Cheap VHS full-screen transfer. I sent mine back and get a refund!
5,"Great movie, great actors","This movie really holds up even today. Mickey Rourke does a spectacular job as the disfigured con who gets a new face. He has the tenderness underneath the tough exterior, always a winning combination for me.Ellen Barkin is great too as the tough moll gal. Lots of action and lots of drama. Highly recommended"
5,johnny wicked handsome,"way back when this movie first came out, i so wanted to go see it. my now ex husband who i was dating then promised, i mean promised he would take me to see it.......never happened (should have taken that as a sign). it had to been around about a week, because it was not playing when a friend and i planned to go. i was heartbroken. too me mickey rourke is such a gifted actor. i am sooooo glad he is back in action. when i got this movie, you don't know how excited i was to see it after all these years. thank you mickey rourke and thank you amazon!!! i don't care what anyone says, mickey is the best!!!!! always will be!!!!his portayal of his character was fantastic! wonderfully done. mickey rourke does have a gift."
4,"Great movie, bad accents","This is a really great movie about loyalty, revenge, and what we're willing to give up. The end is such a bummer (sorry to spoil). As (almost) always, Mickey Rourke gives a fantastic performance. Elizabeth McGovern is not a good choice for the role she has, and her fake accent is SO BAD she should give up her SAG card. She helped knock it down to four stars for me. Ellen Barkin is over the top but gotta love her brassiness. It's really entertaining and you are dying to know what will happen next. And WOW, it's a SHORT movie! Only about 1.5 hours. I'm happy to have this in my permanent on-demand video collection."
1,"Great movie, lousy DVD.",I was at first excited to discover that Walter Hill's 1989 cult favourite was finally being released on DVD.Unfortunately this DVD is issued by Artisan who did a an equally terrible job with Hill's Extreme Prejudice DVD.What's so bad about it? It's Full Frame (!). The picture looks like it was transfered directly from a a muddy VCR print.Save your money and hope that one day someone will release this DVD PROPERLY.Artisan should be ashamed of themselves.
4,"Good film, bad DVD","This moody drama piece is for the most part very good. Mickey Rourke is excellent in the title role; a disfigured criminal who gets a shot at redemption but ultimately chooses revenge.Well directed by Walter Hill with a good music score by Ry Cooder. All the cast do a good job, the story is tight and fast paced and some good action sequences to boot.Pity about the DVD, it's fullscreen and this deserves to be in glorious widescreen."
2,"Great motion picture, but a very poor dvd release.","I really liked this movie, so i bought it the moment it came out on DVD. But i have to say what a poor job did they do at Artisan. Full Screen transfer and blurry picture. I should say that they used a VHS tape as master for the dvd, what a mistake to make. So i give two stars because of the movie not because of the dvd release.If you want to buy this picture on DVD, buy the region 2 version of Momentum. This edition is Widescreen Anamorphic and has really good picture quality."
4,Great Movie; Lousy DVD,"Ahh, here we go, capitalizing on Mickey Rourke's ""comeback"" via ""The Wrestler,"" with the first of (probably) several old Rourke films. I loved this film when I saw it in theaters, bought a copy of the Laser Disc (which is in the correct widescreen ratio), and was looking forward to upgrading to DVD when this title was released several years ago by, I think, Artisan. Finding out it was full screen, I passed. I was hoping for a DVD upgrade to widescreen, but to no avail.Anyway, directed by Walter Hill with his usual action-packed style, and acted superbly by Rourke, Lance Henrikson and Ellen Barker, this is a great movie that demands to be seen in its widescreen glory. Come on, guys, let's get it right this time around!"
5,Johnny Handsome DVD,I agree with the other reviewer; this is a very well-crafted film. It'll be nice to see it in widescreen and with high-quality picture on Blu-ray in July.
2,over rated cliched cajun crud,"Its not a great movie or a cool movie or even an interesting movie, its just a bad B movie. Lousy script, middle of the road performances b grade all the way except for Rourke. The cajun accents were as phoney as can be, the BAD couple was bad. The crummy production values and cardboard characters are typical of the genre. what is most obvious in this and films by the same producers is that they will bend over back ward to use blasphemy in christian setting like churches cemeteries, or when Freeman moves into frame with a cross behind him before cursing. Likewise the scene in angelheart where the devil reprimands Rourke for cursing in the church."
3,LET'S HAVE A WIDESCREEN RELEASE ALREADY!,"This is a great movie that deserves a better DVD release - audio/video remastered and, please, PLEASE! Get it right and make it widescreen this time around."
4,Library of flute classics(Library of classics),"Very good chalenge, well gradedInce selectionWould be even incer with accompagnying CD..."
5,My favorite Bright Eyes t shirt,It is my favorite t shirtof my favorite band: bright eyesthe only problem?i have not received it!Sorry
5,Disco Classics but not the usual mainstream.,"This is one of the best disco albums available. It is basically a compilation of the original versions of songs that have either been covered or sampled by dj's & other groups over the past 10 or so years. The stand out tracks are 'You can't hide from yourself' by Teddy Pendergrass which was recently covered by DJ Sneak,'Moment of my life' by Inner Life, covered by Bobby D'Ambrosio, 'Sweet Tears' by Roy Ayres, covered by Nu Yorican Soul & 'Life on Mars'by Dexter Wensel. The covers are good but the originals are usually better. Most songs are in the 5 to 6 minute range so you get the full versions. There is a Jumpin'1 CD out which is also excellent."
4,Very sturdy box!,"Would have given it 5 stars if it would have been just a BIT bigger, but all in all a very nice wooden toy bench / box. Might be a hair overpriced too, but the value is in the construction of the parts - solid wood, easy directions, and it even comes with wood glue to help the pieces hold for longevity. We have 2-year-old twins, so I've put together my fair share of tables, toys, cribs, etc, and this was the sturdiest thing I've assembled thus far. I'm 220 lbs, and have no fear of sitting on this bench. Great birthday gift for our boys!"
4,Cute look,"I love the way it looks, but it is small so doesn't hold much. My son loves it though bc he can climb on it, and he does A LOT. I didn't use the wood glue in all the places you put screws and they fall out sometimes, so make sure you use the glue!! My son loves the things you spin on it too."
3,Motor is lacking,The design of the hopper works well but I found the motor to be lacking. At times it would not spin at all and prevent the paint from feeding into the marker. Not bad for the price but you could do better.
1,Good try but not worth it at any price.,"If you or a neighbor has a wireless Internet connection, and few purchasing this item would not, or a wireless phone using the 2.4Ghz spectrum, skip this product. Even with multiple channel capability the interference renders this product useless. Further, an e-mail on a driver issue for the video capture board took nearly a week for a terse response. Spend the extra money for a wired solution and save yourself from disappointment."
3,It could be a good cam if cables are longer,"The camera is very easy to install. However, in order to find the right spot for the receiver to get the best signal, you have to move the receiver around. When the cables that come with the cam are too short, you don't have much choice but move the TV along with the receiver or take the VCR out your TV shelf. It's too bad that I found no place to buy a longer digital and sound cable, neither on Swann's web site. Then finally I found a spot that get the best reception, my VCR that connects to the receiver with that provided short cable is 2 feet away from the TV shelf. Other than that, the picture is clear and sound is fine. Night vision is amazingly clear. Not a bad cam."
5,A wonderful exciting book.,"Ellla Enchanted is a creative book. The Author creates a world full of Fairies, Ogres, Elves, and Giants. When Ella was born, a foolish fairy gave her the gift of obediance. Whenever Ella is given an order she must do it, no mattter what it is, even killing herself.

Soon one of the daughters, Hattie, realizes that Ella has to do whatever she demands. Now Hattie is ruining Ella's life by giving her awful and mean orders. Ella knows she has to break the curse soon. But How?"
5,It's the best fairy tale we ever read!,Ella Enchanted is the best book I ever read. Me and my mom are doing a fairy tale club. Ella Enchanted has been the best book so far in our fairy tale club. I give it a hundred thumbs up! I love Ella Enchanted.
5,THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!,"I never loved a book so much! When you're done with it you want it to keep going and never ending. When I was done, I wished so much that there was such a place as Frell. I've read this book so many times. But watch out, once you start you won't be able to put it down!~"
5,"Ella Enchanted: A timeless classic, well, sorta","Ella Enchanted is a wonderful. Think Cinderella, add some ogres, a ""gift"", and more fairies. Ella is also called Cinders once or twice (see?) In this version, after Ella's mother dies, she is stuck with her father. She becomes close friends with the prince, Char, but when the time comes, there is one thing standing between her and her love. A gift. You see, when she was born a farie named Lucinda bestowed a ""gift"" upon her, except the gift is more of a curse. She gave Ella the gift of obedience. She is forced to follow every order placed upon her. When Char proposes to her, she must refuse, or put him and the kingdom in danger. But ,her wicked stepsisiters (what you thought they wouldn't be in here?) are ordering her to say yes. Does she fight this and save the one she loves? You bet! After she breaks the curse, and she is no longer under the spell, the universal happy ending occurs. She marries Char and lives happliy ever after."
5,Two Words: A Masterpiece,"This captivating novel took my breath away, discussing the interesting yet perilous life of 15-year-old Ella of Frell. Her mother's death, sliding down banisters, enchanting ogres, and encountering a treacherous stepfamily are only a few elements of the wonderful story. A twist on the tale of Cinderella, Ella is forced upon the everlasting ""gift"" of obedience. She must follow any order given, no matter how riduculous or tragic it may be. Follow her in her quest to break the curse, with romance, wit, and humor all the way, and read Ella Enchanted. It's a masterpiece!"
5,Ella Enchanted,"This is the wonderful cinderella story of Ella, who was given a curse by a fairy. She is lost for hope, but when the prince, her love, could be killed she finds the strength within her to break the spell. It is definitly worth it to read Ella Enchanted!!"
5,Ella Enchants audiences of all Ages,"Unicorns, princes, ogres, oh my! These are just some of the surprises one will encounter while reading Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. It is the tale of a young girl named Ella who is under the spell of obedience and must obey every order given to her. As you read, you will follow her adventures through the forest of the ogres and the land of the giants. Ella Enchanted is just as exciting as it is well written. Levine does a great job capturing the imagination of audiences of every age. Though it is grouped as young adult literature, it never fails to strike the awe in the older audiences as well. This is a book that will make you look forward to every page and make you never want to put it down. With every chapter comes new adventures of Ella and her wonderful unicorn, apple. This book is a must read for people of all ages and definitely deserves 5 out of 5 stars for creativity and imagination."
4,Ella Enchanted Review,"The book Ella Enchanted is a great adaptation of a classic fariy tale. The story is about a girl named Ella who at birth was given the gift of obedience by a fariy, which turns out not to be such a great gift. After her mother dies, her father remarries and Ella gains two stepsisters. They discover that Ella has to obey them and they boss her around. Meanwhile Ella is falling in love for Prince Char. This book is well written and the characters are well developed. Gail Carloson Levine takes the idea of recreateing a story heard many times, which is potentially boring, and gives it her own twists, which makes it new again. Will Ella end up with the prince and live happily ever after? Read Ella Enchanted and find out."
4,A book for All,"The book ""Ella Enchanted"" was very interesting. It was about a young girl who was given the gift of obediance by a fairy named Lucinda. Throughout the book there was humor, respect and adventure. The characters are well described by the author. I am able to picture the images of the characters. The characters are well described by the author. The descriptive words in this story were amazing.There were a lot of unexpected twists to this story. If you have not read this story you do not know what you are missing."
1,Ella Enchanted,"I really hated this book. it did not capture my interests at all. I found it a ""chick book"". i advise you to go out and watch the movie if you have to, and read somthing else, more interesting like harry potter or somthing..."
1,Ella Enchanted(I never actually read the whole book),"I never actually read this whole book but from what I did read I didn't like it. I love ""Cinderella"" in all but this was just a tid bit too simular!I think this book is a total waste of time!"
1,Too Many Positive Reviews,"I was going to buy this book, but before I did I decided to check out the customer reviews and saw that they were all glowingly positive. This kind of customer unanimity can only come from puppet accounts. I will not support this seller's shady business practices."
1,this is the stupidest book ever,"this book thit i read was the most booring book that i have ever read and i hate it and i dont think that n e 1 should ever read this book, it is soooo GAY!!!! it was like a chore reading it . i had to read it fore a class in school. NEVER READ THIS. it is a descrase to human nature."
1,Stupid book,"Honestly, this is the dumbest book I've ever read. That's why it appeals to girls, duh. It's about some girl grafted after Cinderella who does everything she's told. Now WHY, WHY, is she so stupid to listen to everyone ?! Girl, just go over to the person who's asking you, and freaking scream in her face with hot smelly breath and flecks of spit flying from your mouth, ""NO! I WILL NOT LISTEN !"" Jeez, this is such a lame book. No realistic storyline, a fairy tale ending, and a stupid girl who can't freaking SAY NO contributed into making this book such an idiotic teacup of a story. Levine ? Go fly a kite. You are a terrible, intensely hurrendous author. AUTHOR?! Jeez. A mouse writes better then you. No, an elephant. A rat. ANYONE ! You write about a stupid girl who listens to everything she's told because of a spell. Oooh, that sounds REALLY intriguing ! Censored."
5,Awesome,Awesomeness!!! My favorite book of all time. I've read this book countless of times and it never gets old. Recommended!
5,Absolutely enchanting,"This book is excellent! It has just the right amount of fairies, royalty, spells, and all those other touches that make a fairy tale perfect. I've always loved ""Cinderella,"" and I was ecstatic when I discovered ""Ella Enchanted."" This book is great for all ages and types. I know three people who like completely different types of books, and yet they all liked ""Ella Enchanted."" I think that Gail Carson Levine has done a wonderful job of creating a novelized version of ""Cinderella."" A must-read for everyone!"
5,The Best! Enchanting!,"Ella Enchanted was the best book I ever read! It is a fasinating story of a girl in relation to Cinderella. She is very selfwitted to leave her Finishing School after her father, Sir Peter sent her there. She is a charming fantasy character along with her other friends like the Dragons and enemys like the ogres. She keeps herself from marring the prince at first intill breaking the spell. A charming story for young,adventure lovers."
5,Enchanted me as well,"This really is an enchanting, delightful novelization of the Cinderella tale, complete with a spunky, intelligent heroine. I found the writing a little simplistic at my age (I'm in my 30s) but I highly recommend it for teenagers. Really, though, anyone who enjoys fairy tale novels will think this worth a read. It compares fairly well to Robin McKinley's Beauty, The Blue Sword and The Hero and the Crown, although the writing in those books is a couple of levels more complex. Give those a read too if you haven't yet!"
5,My god! I love this book!,"I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! My god, I love it! Ella Enchanted is my most favorite book ever. Because of this I'm looking forward to the movie Ever After, though I hoped that they'd base the movie after Ella Enchanted. Their loss. I cry every time I read this book, I don't know why. It has such a wonderful ending! I love it! Goodness, I'm talking nonsense. But I still love this book. You can't every put it down. Ella is such a wonderful person, kind, nice, spunky, and very real. Most authors make their characters perfect, but Ella has real thoughts. Char sounds like the type of rare guy who acts like a human-being and is the girl's ideal prince."
3,Ella Enchanted,I think that this book was a page-turner. That's because Gail Levine wrote the story so that I didn't want to stop reading. I would like to read another book written by Gail Levine because it might have the same writing as Ella Enchanted or it might be different. This book I would recommend to other girls. I would do that because Ella Enchanted is written from a girl's perspective and I think girls would like the book better. One of the many exciting parts is when ogres attacked Ella and prince Char rescued her. If are a person who likes fantasy and stories about fairies you will like Ella Enchanted.
4,Enchanted,The book expresses lots of feelings from inside Ella. It has drematic scenes for your head.Her tradgeys break into yours and you are swept away by the book.The words used are hard to pronouce. The book has a great story line. The love that is in her mind dangerous is one only in a story. Hope you read it.
4,"Ella Enchanted, ME!","I really enjoyed this book. Though I will admit it was a little slow starting out. Let me give you some backround. When Ella was born a spell was put on her, a spell that commanded her to do whatever she was told. After her mother dies Ella is determined to find the witch who casted the spell and ask her to put away the spell. will Ella even find the witch? Thar is for me to know and you to find out!"
5,I Couldn't Put It Down,"The first time I read this book I couldn't put it down. Literally. It was the best book I'd ever read and still is. I have read so many times I could tell you the story by heart. I recommend this book to everyone, even if you hate reading."
5,Ella Enchanted,"I thought Ella Enchanted was the best book! It is a mix in between a fairy tale and a adventure. I loved the part where Ella escaped from Finishing School. This was such a good book that I could not put it down! I did not want to send it back to the library I wanted to keep it and read it again and again! If you read this book, I can tell you that you made the right choice. Hope you enjoy it!"
4,Ella Enchanted: A Cinderella Story,"Imagine the story of Cinderella and her awful step sisters. Ella Enchanted is about a girl named Ella who is extremely close with her mother. When her mother becomes ill and dies, Ella's father must come home to take care of her. The father is an evil man and gives any young child the chills to think how unfair he can be. The rest of the book is for you to find out. I recommend Ella Enchanted for girls in the age range of 10 and 12. It is a page- turning novel that you can sit down and read for hours. This book has mystery, love, and magic. I loved this novel because it always made me look forward to reading it. Also, I was amazed in how the author, Gail Carson Levine, turned a simple childish story into a enchanting novel."
5,At first I was hesitant,"At first I was not sure if I wanted to read Ella Enchanted. My friend told me so many time to read it but I thought it looked stupid. Then, my teacher started to read it to my class. I loved it SO much I went out, bought my own copy and finished it before my class. Ella Enchanted is about a girl who lives in the country of Frell, Ella. Ella is very close to her mother and her cook, Mandy. But also, Ella is cursed. When she was born, the horrid fairy Lucinda put this curse on her, and she is always obediant. I mean, if someone told her to never take her hand off her head, he hand would always be on her head. Likewise, if someone told her to slash herself through the heart, that she would have to do. So, this book is about Ella and her adventures to break the curse."
3,Ella Enchanted,Ella Enchanted is a book about a girl named Ella who has a curse. This curse is that she has to flo all the orders she is give. Her Mom dies and tells her not to tell anyone because she belives people wpuld take advantege of her. Some people take advantage of her.(This is a Cinderlla like story.)
5,This book is da bomb!!!!!,"All my friends recommended it to me for about two years. My best friend came to have two copies, and she gave me one. AND I LOVE IT!!!! Ella is so funny and pretty and smart and clever......She is a good role model for girls my age (which is 11.)"
5,Totally Coooooooooool!,I really liked the book. I first read it for a school report and read it 10 times. My favorite thing in the book is Ella's magic book. I like the part at the end where Ella goes to the balls and dances with Char.
5,READ THIS NOW!!,Wonderful twist on a classic fairytale. Ella touches people of all ages and there is a lot that we can learn from her. Great for dreamers of all ages!
4,The Detailed Cinderella Story,"The prequel to Cinderella, Ella Enchanted, is a mind-boggling telling of the story of Cinderella; telling you what happened before the ""Once upon a time"", how she ended up with her step-sisters and mother, and how she met the prince before the big ball! You also learn about her father, her real mother, and her other fairy god mother, who's enchantments more trouble than you think. A modernized Cinderella story, all the details missing from the fairy tale, are filled in, Gail Carson Levine has showed my dad and I how much was missing from the real version of the Cinderella story."
5,Ella Enchanted,"This book is about a girl who was given the ""gift"" of obedience when she was young. She is determined to break it. Can she do it? My favorite character in this book was Ella because no matter how hard it was to do stuff, she never gave up. She had to fight ogars, be a housemaid to her step- mother, an dgiven all of her money to a girl named Olive. Over all I would give this book the best rating of any of the books that I have ever read."
5,I loved it!,"I thought this book was wonderful! I couldn't put it down for one second, because it had my attention. I recommend this book to any kind of reader.Gail Carson Levine did an excellent job! Ella Enchanted is now one of my favorite books!"
3,Michelle Boots- Ella Enchanted review,"If you like fantasy books, you will like Ella Enchanted. Lucinda, a fairy, has put a curse on Ella, the main character. Now, Ella must obey every command given to her, no matter what it is. I liked this book because the author, Gail Carson Levine, kept me reading to find out if Ella looses her curse or not. I did not like this book, because I do not like fantasy books. If you like fantasies, and you like suspense, Ella Enchanted is the perfect book for you. Readers will also like the audio book, because the reader is very good. She can do many different voices, and she reads very smoothly."
3,Ella Enchanted,"Ella Enchanted is a story a girl named Ella. She has a spell that was caste on her. She was crying when she was a baby and it annoyed her fairy godmother. Her godmother put a spell on her that made her obedient when someone demanded her to do something .now the only way she can break the spell is if she finds the fairy Lucinda who is the only person who can break the spell the plot was finding Lucinda so that she can break the spell. This books setting took place in Ella's house and neighborhood the theme off the book was fairies, magic and stuff like that. I did like this book because I thought It was interesting."
3,CinderELLA,"This book was a very adventurous book because it had many kinds of adventures that she was on and also this book has lots of mythical things. The girl named Ella was very happy with her life until her mother died. She had gotten a curse to always be obedient when she was a young baby.Then she meets the prince Charmont (Char), they fall in love and she never wants to see him again after he leaves to Athoria.Ella goes to a ball like cinderella as someone else and she meets Char there. Her fairy goodmother makes a coach and horses from pumkins and mice like cinderella again! Also they will go away at midnight!She gets to the ball and leaves the ball running away from Char and her evil stepsister Hattie and loses a slipper she wuz wearing. Then the prince goes around finding her and when he does they get married!This book is a lot like cinderella. This book is a wonderful book to read and recomend it to everyone who likes fairy tales!"
3,It's good-,"It's a very entertaining, lighter, occasionally funny read, but I also agree with the review titled, ""Why are you all raving about this book?"" I can ask the same question, because:1)At the beginning and middle of this book, there was hardly a resemblence to Cinderella, the story it was based off. Once you get to the last four or so chapters, almost everything is the same, so for people who dislike the story of Cinderella, they might want to consider skipping this book.2)At the start of the story, (after all the history of how Ella received her curse), Ella seemed like an intelligent girl with human emotion/human thoughts that readers could relate to. Once she realized she was in love, she started to lose some of those thoughts and act lovesick and (possibly) even ditzy.3)Some situations in this book were hard to follow and had almost no point in being in the story.My final recommendations for this book is to do ""research"" on the plot and characters before buying."
2,Too Predicatble,"I did not like Gail Carson's Ella Enchanted. I thought that Gail Carson focused too much on the beginning, and then rushed the end. It was way too predictable and the plot was kind of shallow. Ella made a big deal in the beginning about not going to finishing school, and she's only at finishing school for a couple of chapters. It seems that all the characters exaggerated and make a big deal out of something, and in the rest of the book, the problem just seems to go away. Some of this story, like with the prince, was too coincidental that it was unbelievable. Its fun to get lost in spells and a mystic land, but the magic parts of the story was not the part of the book that was out of this world!"
2,Beautifuly written romance/action/drama/comedy/...,"Any sane human will not be able to help falling in love with this charming, excellently crafted novel. Like a fairy tale for older children and a read aloud book for the younger, Ella Enchanted is pefect for ages 2-112."
5,Ella Enchanted,"I love this book! I've read it 5 times or more! I suggest it to girls from the ages 10-15. I think this book has everything a book should have, humor, romance, fantasy, and more! I encourage girls to read this book, it's great!"
3,excalent book review.,I think it was a very good book. It was cool when they talked about her curse. And talking about fairies was cool.And when she fell in love. Then ending up with the man she loves.
5,Enchanting--Not Another Word For It,"Ella, rebellious and smart, is cursed from birth with the ""gift"" of obeidience, by a fairy who doesn't understand the cruelness of the things she does. Levine enterweaves the classic story of Cinderella, an adventure that leaves the reader hanging for more, and words that slip easily into teh reader's mind and are as tasty as Ella's fairy tonic. A good read, and a classic in the frazzled-fairytales genre."
5,Ella Good (a student's review),"I think Ella Enchanted is a very wonderful fairy tale. It's probably my favorite book ever. This book is kind of sad at the beginning, but it's perfect for those who like fairy tales. You go, Ella!"
5,Ella Enchanted,"Ella Enchanted. The title says it all. This book is nothing but enchanted, complete with kings and queens, princes and giants, ogres and elves and even fairies. It's the story of young girl who has the terrible curse of obedience, Ella would chop off her own head if she were ordered to.In this book Ella fights to save herself and the lives of others, even the life of Prince Charmount, whom she is in love with. She's ridiculed by her stepfamily as they force her to become a scullery made in her own home. All of this, the curse of obeying was the result of one persons stupid mistake, the fairy Lucinda.This is her story, it's all about the girl who breaks the curse, falls in love with the prince and even has Hatti and Olive, her horrid stepsisters to make it all harder. It's better than Cinderella. In my opinion, this book is not one to pass up. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who love tales of magic and enchantment."
3,Adventures of Ella,"Ella enchanted is a fantasy book about Ella and her many adventures. Her journey begins when she goes to the giants wedding, to seek out the fairy who gave her the ""gift"" of always obeying. On her way she meets the forest elves. They give her shelter a food for the night. In her next adventure she get kidnapped by the man-eating ogers. She hypnotizes the ogers to make them fall asleep and she can then escape. Along with the journeys she meets new friends and also some enemies. Our thoughts on this book is that it was an incredibly exciting book. You didn't know what would happen next. We recommend this book to anyone who likes to read fairy tales!By Lydia, Maddie, and Krista."
4,Ella Enchanted,Have you ever wanted to read a book about a girl that had to do whatever someone told her because she was put under a spell. Then you should read Ella Enchanted. I think you will really like it.
5,A truly wonderful story,"Ella Enchanted is one of the best books I've ever read. Based on the classic story of Cinderella, with a twist, Ella is an independent young woman with a curse she will overcome. The author combines just the right amount of adventure, humor, wit, romance, and truth to create an intricately creative tale."
5,Enchanting!,"I love this book. It is charming, witty, and touching. Ella has a vivid personality of bravery and humor. Her gallantry is deep, but her ever so funny wit keeps her audience laughing. Ella Enchanted includes the original text of the Cinderella tale, but has many creative twists of Ms. Levine's own ideas. I read this over and over again, and to anyone who enjoys the beauty of fantasy, courage, and love, they will fall in love with this book as I did. As she did to me, Ella will leave you enchanted forever."
5,THE BEST BOOK,"This is my all-time favorite book. Gail Carson-Levine is an imaginative, funny, creative, interesting writer. I can't express this how good this book is. Ella is cursed at birth by a fairy who thinks she is doing good. The ""gift"" makes Ella obey everybody. This is a major problem since her mother died, her father doesn't know, and the handsome Char has come into the picture. Through adventures with ogers and mad fairies and love, Ella is determined to be herself and break the curse."
5,i love this book,my mom got me this book at the library and i told her that i would hate it. but when i read it i found myself enjoying it.
5,Great,"It's a classic. I've read Ella Enchanted numerous times and it never gets old. The author seems to have come from another time. She truly has talent with fairytales. The characters completely admiral, but none so as Ella herself. What's the worst curse one can be bestowed with? It might possibly be the one Ella has. No matter what, if she is told to do something she has to do it. She can dodge if you ask her, but hardly anyone does. When she is told never to tell of her curse, things could get bad. Finally after her father marries an awful woman with awful daughters, Ella makes a stand. She's going to find the fairy that put the curse on her if it's the last thing she does. This book truly is one of my very favorites. I recommend this to all ages and all genders."
2,An okay book,"I thought Ella Enchanted was an okay book. I reminded me of Cinderella. This book is mainly about a girl who can't brake a curse her fairy put on her. I don't recommend this book to people who want an origanal story, and not a remake."
2,Enchantingly Boring,"I really did not enjoy the book Ella Enchanted. It was about a girl, Ella, growing up in a magical world filled with fairies and ogres and elves. It seemed a bit too feathery, if you ask me. There was way too much romance for this to actually be a good book. Read it if you want to, but I would only give it 2 stars."
2,"This book was ""OK""","I have to say that this book wasn't that good. I struggled to get through it. It just wasn't interesting. It gave you details of things that didn't matter. The only good part in the book was when you are about 3/4 of the way finished with it. I think that is too long of a wait for a book to get good. If you are looking for a book that will hold your attention as you read, you probably don't want to read Ella Enchanted."
1,uninventive and for-girls-only,"I was extremely disappointed with this book, which has somehow achieved successful status with readers and booksellers alike. Not only is it both a precious and boring retelling of a story already told clearly and simply, it is an unfulfilled promise of an adventure story for much of the first half of the book, and an insipid, somewhat chauvinistic romance for much of the second. After two children turned their noses up at it saying that it was ""boring and stupid"", I thought that surely they must be wrong. After a quick read (more time than it deserved), I fully agree. A two-fisted ""thumbs down""."
5,An enchanted fantasy,"This book was amazing. Halfway through it, I realized that this was a wonderfully woven tale. Everything about it was perfect. I found myself despising Lucinda, and admiring Ella's personality. I loved her attitude. All of my friends have a kind of ""reading circle"". We pass on books which we like. Well, you can be assured this book was included. Recently we had to do a writing assignment, to pretend you are some character from a book or movie. Well, all four of us thought immediately of ELLA ENCHANTED. I must say, this book was one of the best I have ever read."
5,Needed a new copy,"I will always love this book. I just realized that I lost my copy, so this was a replacement. I was sad that the original cover art was on the more expensive copy, but this will do just fine."
4,A new fairy tale,"At Ella's birth, a fairy begifts her with the ability to always obey. It turns out to be more of a curse than a gift, however, when Ella's friends learn of her compliance and use it to make Ella their servant.Some interesting questions after reading this story: Is compliance always good? When is it better to be able to make decisions for one's self? How important is the ability to choose to obey or refuse to obey?"
3,Ella Enchanted,"I recommend the book Ella Enchanted to other six graders because. The introduction is okay , but when you get deep into the rising action it gets better.Then when you finish when the main character becomes happy the story gets better, but there is some romance which I know no guy's who like romance.After I finished I was like everthough the main character is a girl Ella Enchanted is okay.Also I thought ""there was some action and humor"" so it was not so bad. So I think other six grade boys and girls should read the book Ella Enchanted."
4,"If you loved the book keep, away from the movie...","Well, I think other reviewers here have made it clear how aweswome this book is, so I'll just be wasting your time telling you about it. I'll just throw in my two cents for it. I hardly find Ella ""too perfect"", like Cinderella is. I like Ella's unselfishness, and she is very realistic. If you loved this book (and what right-minded person wouldn't?), stay away as much as you can from the movie. It does not stick to the book's plot, uses over-used cliches, and throws in a whole hunk of junk. It was an insult to Gail Carsine Levine! Read the book. Don't bother with the movie."
5,My favorite book!,Ella is a wonderfull character whoes clumsiness and personality add comedy to the book. she can get herself out of anything. Of coarse she needs help from Char ocasionally!
5,A Must Read For Anyone Who Likes Adventure Or Fantasy!,"This book has it all! Ella Enchanted is one of my favorite books because it shines a new and less fairy tale like view on the Cinderella story. I suggest this book to anyone who likes fantasy, adventure or even romance (a bit)!"
5,"Ella Enchanted, A Very Enchanting Book","What can I say except this book is a real thriller! It is so fascinating it is hard to put down. With a curse that makes you obey any command anything can happen. Ella is fifteen and quite out of the ordinary. This girl can speak or imitate any language she hears. In this book she encounters elves, giants, and even some nasty ogres who almost eat her! But what really makes this book a must buy is Ella's determination to break the spell that is upon her. She tries and tries, yet she doesn't succeed until she has an unbelievable meeting with the prince, Char! This thriller is wonderful. All the characters including Mum Olga, Hattie, and Olive, make the book Ella Enchanted everything it is. You have to read this book."
5,A great book for all ages!,"This was a great book about a girl who is cursed at birth and she has to follow whatever orders she is given. She gets into all kinds of problems and adventures. This book was very well-written and if you haven't read it yet, I strongly recommend it."
5,a true fairy tale with a deeper meaning,"Everyone knows the stpry of Ella Enchanted, especially since the movie has come out. But apart from the maigc and the fairies in the book, for me the sense in the book is the ""fight"" of a girl against obedience. A ""virtue"" installed in many girls still today, stopping them from doing or saying what they trully think and believe in. I recommend this book as good discussion material for a girl's book club to make reader's (girls) aware of this ""virtue"", which is not one anymore. Today, there is obedience in a negative way and obedience in being polite and well behaved and especially girls need to learn about that fine line between those two."
5,"Funny, for anyone who likes FUN!!!!","Under a curse, Ella goes through many hardships in life. Then something awful happens, and she is sent to finishing school, it is horrible, especially with the curse! She has fun times, too. Example: She makes friends with a prince."
5,A Cinderella story worth reading,"An amazing story of a young girl with a dream.A cursed placed on her as a child makes her obeidient,she has to do what people tell her.This curse keeps her from marrying the prince, for she is afraid enemy countries will use her to do their dirty work.The author knows how to take a well known plot and make it a amazing story."
5,This book was awesome,"Ella Enchanted was one of my favorite books I have read all school year. I think this book should be on every school's reading lists to read during the year. I hope everyone will get the chance to read such an awesome book. If not, you are truly making a large mistake."
5,Ella Enchanted,"Ella Enchanted was a simply wonderful book. I really enjoyed it. It's about a girl who has a curse- or really it's supposed to be a gift. The gift was the gift of obedience. Ella isalways obedient. She absolutely HAS to obey an order. She tries not to, but she has to after a few minutes. This is a fantasy adventure woven into a twisted version of Cinderella. It has a touch of romance as you can guess as well. It was really good, and you can't put it down!Read it! You'll like it!"
4,Good but not great,"First off I would like to say that I like this book. It is a beautiful and original story. It just lacks contenuity, practicality, enough definition and maturity. The writing sounds to young sometimes. I can't really explain it.The story is marvelous and so great. The characters are amazing and lovable. That is why this novel should get a four.If you want a book that is more well rounded try, ""The Seer and the Sword"" by Victory Hanley or ""Green Rider"" by Kristen Britain."
3,An enchanting novel about a teenage girl who has a gift.,"Ella Echanted is an enchanting novel about a teenage girl that has a gift. The gift of obedience. She tries to break the curse so that she could be free and do what she wants to do. On her quest to be free, she meets elves, ogres, giants and gnomes."
5,This book was awesome!,"I finished reading the book about a month ago and still keep thinking about how awesome it was. It may be very fantasy but that's the whole point. This is one of the only fantasy books I would read, and ""The Alchemist"". If you don't have this book you should get it because it's one of the best books I've read!"
5,You'll Never Put It Down!,"This book was one of the greatest books I've ever read. I've read it over numerous times and never grown tired of it. Everytime the romance and suspense storys seem better and better. There was no reason for this book not to recieve the Newberry award! I definetly agree with Charlotte that whoever enjoyed Ever After will enjoy this book too. All I can say is that this is a great book, I read it over and over again and that you should get yourself a copy of it so you can experience it too!"
5,Want a book to keep you reading? Read ELLA ENCHANTED NOW!,"This book is about a girl named Ella. Ella is put under a curse when she is a baby and only her,her mother and their cook mandy ( who is a fairy) know about it. Her Mother dies when Ella is thirteen and her father is always gone.Then one day her father decides to send her to a school far away.This book is well written and has lots of exciting parts.If you don't have this book you should get it NOW!"
4,Ella Enchanted,Ella Enchanted is one of the best books I ever read. On a scale to one to five I'd give it a four! Ella enchanted is based on the story Cinderella. It's about a girl named Ella. She has a fairy godmother and her fairy godmother's name is Mandy. Mandy is a cook and she is with Ella all the time. Another fairy named Lucinda gave Ella a curse that made her obedient. She had to do everything anyone told her to. Ella's mother dies when she is fifteen. She can talk different languages. This is a really good book you should read it.
5,Totally awesome!!!,"I suprised my friends by reading a fairy tale in class. I did a report on it in my English Honours class, and now the teacher is having us read it because it is a fairy tale, and even at this age, it is enchanting..."
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read,"My name is Ryan and I live in Macon, GA. I loved Gail Carson Levine's ""Ella Enchanted"" because the book never lets go of you. The plot keeps flowing. I would recommend it to any one who loves fairy tales for older children or young adults. It truly is the best book I've ever read."
5,A Cinderella story to remember!,"Ella is under a curse from a foolish fairy. She has to do whatever anyone commands her to do. Her mother and the cook are the only ones who understand. When Ella's mother dies she finds out her cook is her fairy godmother. At her mothers funeral Ella meets a prince who becomes her friend, but is unable to tell him of her curse because her mother commanded her not to. Ella is sent to finishing school with a girl who hates Ella, and figured out her curse. She makes Ella do things that she doesn't want to do. Ella runs away in search of the one person who can lift the curse. In the meanwhile Ella's father marries the mother of Ella's foe! Will Ella ever be cured of her curse? How will life be like with her mother and stepsisters? I read this book in one day because I couldn't put it down. To find out what happens to Ella, and the prince, you MUST read this book!"
3,A Charming Story,"It is a very nice, charming story. I am 8 years old and I loved that book. It is similar to Cinderella and I had read this one before, too. But that one is long, has details, and more attractive."
5,Loved it!,"A charming re-imagining of Cinderella, and very well written. Ella is a great heroine - smart, witty, and full of gumption. I would happily recommend this book to just about anyone!"
5,"To me, it's a CLASSIC!","I have been an avid reader since the 5th grade, and at first, I didn't want to give ELLA ENCHANTED a chance because of the tacky cover illustration (of the girl in the green dress), but as they say, ""Never judge a book by its cover."" I finally gave in to reading this book - ordering it from one of those book orders that you get from school. I just want to say that I am now 23 years old and this is STILL my favorite book. It has everything that I love in a book - comedy and romance, and the feeling that once the book is over, you're sad because you know you will never find another adventure just like it. It's impossible to put the book down - there are parts that make you want to cry, laugh, and squeal with delight. The romance between Ella and Char is PERFECT and not cheesy at all. I advise anyone with a love of romance and fantasy to give this book a chance because I promise that it's SO WORTH IT - and not to mention, the movie does not do the book justice at all."
2,Interesting book but too difficult for 3rd graders,"While the book stated that the reading level was for ages 8 and up, my third grade girls book club (all kids who were 8) found the book way to difficult to read on their own. Most of us read it to our children. The plot was very good the second half of the book, but the first half was slow, with lots of difficult vocabulary and the story got confusing at points. So in the end I thought the book was okay but was really geared toward 11 year olds."
5,Enchanting,"Ella Enchanted is about a teenage girl from the kingdom/town of Frell. I have both read the book and seen the movie, and am glad to report that both are WONDERFUL!"
2,I really didn't like this book,"I read this book when I was in elementary school, before the movie came out. I really, really didn't like it. It was confusing and the plot just wasn't that interesting. I think the movie might have clarified the book a bit for some readers. I remember trying to figure out what was going on because of the modern slang terms mixed with the Middle English. I didn't like the ending either. For a modern fairytale, the girl getting the prince is a tad bit boring."
5,Enchanting Book,This is a wonderful book! I loved it! It is a Cinderella retelling that makes the characters seem very real and dynamic. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes fantasy.
4,An excellent retelling,An excellent retelling of the Cinderella story. Very cute and lighthearted. I loved it.
5,Ella Enchanted!!!,"Ella Enchanted is one of, if not my favorite book. It far exceeds Gail Carson Levines other books, it is simply wonderful. It is a fanasty but isn't really wierd like fanastys sometimes get. I have read this book nearly 20 times, that is not an exageration. You will love this book if you have any taste in books at all."
3,Kyra's book review,"I think this book was really good. I think it is good because it is like Cinderella, and I like Cinderella a lot. That is a good story. The story was a lot like Cinderella except a little bit of things. One thing was they had diffrent names in Ella Enchanted.In Cinderella they didn't have any curses on anybody. They didn't have a lot of fairies up in the Cindrerlla story. Some of the ways the story is alike is by having a ball. Another way the story is alike is that the Prince is looking for someone to marry at the ball and he finds that person. Ella Enchanted is really good. I think it will be interesting to a lot of little kids because they like a lot of interesting stories and movies. I think a lot of kids will like Ella Enchanted because it is just like Ciderella and lots of kids like it. I recommend little kids to read Ella Enchanted and I recommend this book to anybody because the book is very good and exciting to me. That is why I recommend this book to anybody."
5,Great Story for Young and Old Alike!,This story captured my attention from the beginning. I love the characters and feel like I know them. This is the Cinderella story of Cinderella stories. Read it!
5,Much better than the original,"Ella Enchanted is a great relief from the originalCinderella.While the Grimms Brothers' version might have been fittingfor the time, Ella Enchanted is tailored for the modern day child. Long gone are the days of the damsel in distress, waiting to be rescued. Ella, the main character, has been ""blessed"" with a gift from a foolish fairy. The ""gift"" is Obedience. Ella must obey whatever she is told or suffer grave consequences. She does not take this fate lying down, however. She does everything in her power to resist. The other characters, including the father, are much more believeable in Ella Enchanted than in any other Cinderella story available. Even the Prince is a ""real"" person, not just a man who prances around on a horse all day long. This book is a must read for any modern day school child."
5,Ella takes a thoughtless birthday gift and makes magic!,"A very charming and clever Ella takes the birthday gift of a thoughtless fairy and struggles to make the best of a troublesome situation. Ella is one of the most resourceful, sensible heroines to come along in ages; she thinks! She tries to learn from her mistakes, works to be a good friend, thwarts her enemies without doing violence, and tries valiantly to be a good person. I recommend you look into Ella's clever solutions to the trials of daily life...with or without magic."
4,Cinderella With a Twist,"Gail Carson Levine creatively writes a fantasy story that takes place in the mystical land of Frell. Ella, the main character of the story has been given the ""gift"" of obedience by a fairy named Lucinda. The characters and setting in the story are unique in their own right but are not believeable. The characters are not believeable because they are unrealistic life forms such as elves and gnomes. The theme is well developed throughout the story. The theme is a combination of bravery, selflessness, obedience, and perserverance. There is also a suprise observation that pops up in the story. That observation is that Ella gains her obedience back.I really enjoyed this book. Coming from a male's point of view, it was enjoyable for me. It reminded me of the famous fairy tale Cinderella. This book is best suited for readers at the middle elementary school level. The book gives the reader insight into what it is like to regain something valuable that they lost in the past."
3,Ella curse of life.,I think I would recomend this book to any one because it shows children how they should treat their parents.I learned alot from this book because I learned to respect my mother more.The girl ella in the book has curse put on her when she was born.her mother dies and her father come back from where he was to take care of her.Her and her father don't get along so he ships her off to boarding school.I really liked this book so read it.
3,Starr reviews,"I'm not explaining any part of this book because if you buy it, you'll read it. But since everyone thinks this book is so great, I'm telling you that it's just a retelling of Cinderella. And clearly not one of Levine's best books. Some parts were interesting but I didn't like the retelling. It's totally opposite of the classic story and she just takes it apart and tries to add more adventure."
4,"Jen, you are totally right","I mean, it was great (and even with the Cinderella part it was okay). But she (author) basically copied Cinderella. I mean, the evil step sisters and step mother, the glass shoe, the prince, the pumpkin coach, the prince trying the shoe on peoples feet, then them living happily ever after (those exact words at the ending). I mean, COME ON!"
2,Ella Enchanted is a all right book.,"I give a 2 to Ella Enchanted , I liked it a little. This book reminds me of Cinderalla"
2,A deteriorating plot,"I think that the book started well. However, it got unorigional as the book went on. By the time it got to the part that was exactly like Cinderella, the plot was very unorigional. the clever idea of the curse did not make the second half of the book really good. Probably the only really interesting part about the book was the curse."
5,Ella Enchanted,"This is my Grandma's account, I am eleven years old. Last year my reading group had to read Ella Enchanted. I had all ready watched the movie and the teacher said that the book is similar to the movie, but it is much different. I started to read and I didn't understand at first but around the third or fourth chapter I got hooked on it. We had certain pages we needed to read and I couldn't stop. I liked the storyline of the book. The author really did a very good job at writing it. It was about a baby who kept crying and a witch gave her the gift of obedience. So she was 18 and still had the gift, she figured where the witch was and followed her, she was at a Giant wedding (when I said Giant I was not saying it was big I was saying that the wedding was a Giant wedding, real Giants). She found her and she didn't get her curse/gift take away so eventually the witch takes the curse away and Ella finds a handsome prince and they lived happily ever after."
4,Great book for all ages,I had to read Ella Enchanted as a requirement for a Children's Literature class I am taking and I just loved this book. It is a marvelous re-telling of the classic tale of Cinderella and the author does a great job of doing this. This book takes a compelling story and spins it into numerous tales of everyday life situations set in a world of fantasy. I recommend this saga to people of all ages.
4,Adorable,"I bought this book because I was a big fan of the movie. Though it's pretty different from the movie (and truth be told, is probably a better movie than a book), it's still a quality book and excellent for young girls. It has a good message to young women (and to all children) about believing in yourself and having the knowledge that you can do anything you sset your mind to. I recommend this for a young girl."
5,Enchantment Review,"I thought the book would be about a girl,Ella, that was cursed by a fairy. After reading the story I thought it was really good and romantic and I loved it. It was what i expected but it was a lot like Cinderella but it was still a lot different from it. I still feel the same about the bookand nothing has changed.A girl called Ella was cursed and her life was mostly miserable.Her mother die and her father married a bad woman who had two daughters.They would always tell her what to do and they made her a servant. But she was best friends with the prince, Char. The book is a historical fiction and the author is Gail Carson Levine.I love this book because its sad but romantic and just a fun book to read. Its sad because Ella's mom dies but its romantic because romantic because she lives happily ever after at the end.My rating for this book ,from 1-5,would be 5 because Ithink its a great book.Its a great and fun book to read!"
4,An Ella Enchanted Review,"The book I am reviewing is Ella Enchanted written by Gail Carlson Levine. I think this book deserves four stars. I think this book is pretty good. This book was about a baby girl that was hit with curse of obedience. When she found out she had a curse her life went down hill. So Ella went of to find the fairy that did this to her, but ran into trouble. What will happen next? Read to find out. I recommend this book to kids that like adventure.Emerson N.J. Fifth grade student"
5,Such an Enchanting Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ella Enchanted is truly one of the mmost captivating books I have ever read. My copy is even getting worn out from continuous reading!Ella Enchanted is about a girl named Ella who, at birth, had been given the ""so called"" gift if obedience. Her terrible gift makes her to obey any command given to her. On her quest to break this spell, she meets Prince Char, and the two begin to fall in love. Later on, he proposes marriage to her. Knowing he would never be safe with a cursed woman as his wife,she refuses him against her will.This book has teaches not to be selfish, have respect for your own opinion, and to follow your heart. Gail Carson Levine really puts emotion in the story so you feel every feeling Ella experiances in the story. If there is any book that should be bought, it's this one."
5,I LOVE IT! IT IS MY FAVORITE BOOK!,"I love ""Ella Enchanted""! I think it is a very well written book, especially since Ella has so much character. I recommend this book to everyone because it is funny and enchanting! I loved every single part of it!"
4,Critique and Opinion,"Ok, to start off, this book, in my opinion, was wonderful. It was thoroughly researched, because as anyone who has read the book would know, it doesn't take place nowadays. In a far away fairy-tale world, Ella was born. At birth, a fairy who meant well put a curse on her. The ""blessing"" from Lucinda the Fairy was obidience. What ever someone tells Ella to do, she must do; hence in danger at every moment. If you like fairy-tales, or mythical, magical, any type of stories in that genre, you will absolutely love this. It is, again, well researched, with a spin and an unpredictable plot. I think it is a must-read. Get it today!"
5,This is my FAVORITE book ever!!!!!!,"I first found Ella Enchanted in my library while searching for a book that would at least help me pass my time. I really found a great book! The book is a twist on the traditional Cinderella. What's the twist? Well, the main character, Ella, has been put under a curse that makes her obey. My favorite character was Prince Charmont. He was really sweet, funny, and understanding. I love this book so much that I think that I could memorize it by heart!"
5,EXCELLENT,"I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STUFF, REACH BEFORE I WAS EXPECTING, GOOD PRICE AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH"
4,PuzzleNut,This game is for the puzzle lovers. The only problem I have with this game is the puzzle seem to repeat in each level. Meaning they used the same words over and over. Other than that is very fun game for the PS2.
4,Interesting toys for sale at 2006 AVN award show + Feelings of porn actors in their own words,"It showed the emotion, anxiety, and passionate desire of some porn actors to win the AVN (Adult Video News) awards in 2006. Some actors said in front of the camera they did it because they loved it. Like a well-known actress who quit it in 2000 only to came back to this career in 2006 because she found out it really showed who she was.One of the interesting scene showed 2 vibrators created by an engineer from Taiwan. The first one's top part can vibrate at different frequency than its bottom part. The second one looks like the jaws of a crocodile. He said it stimulated both the G-spot and the clitoris at the same time. Consequently, it can bring on orgasm in 5 minutes.Overall it satisfied my curiosity and provided me with 90 minutes of fun."
4,classic,"A classic teen movie from the '90s. It's funny, poignant, and most of all entertaining. I like the extra stuff in the unedited version, and the DVD has some good features and deleted scenes you may want to check out."
2,Half Baked Pie,"First the disclaimer, perhaps being English so no high school or prom night and being the wrong side of 30 I missed the point but a lot of this I had already seen in the 80's in Porky's and Lemon Popsicle etc. The story is simple. 4 guys agree to lose their virginity by prom night. Hence lots of trying too hard and lots of failure. The funny parts were laugh out loud funny admittedly. The father explaining the art of masturbation to his horrified son and the guy referring to a sex bible whist the girl is unaware were extremely clever. I am not sure that the supposed tender scenes and realisation that sex is well just sex really worked in a teenage movie. But judging from the reviews and sales I am in a minority but there were just too many unfunny moments."
3,Controversial Critisism,I know I will get bad reviews for this but I actually didn't like the first one... This one was just the same as the rated version just one second more of nudity! For that reason its better than the first - but not by much. If you were going to buy the rated or the unrated - go for the rated (it costs less)...
3,Mother of teens says....,"that this is a typical teenage movie. Yes, it borders on soft porn but there are definitely worse movies out there. My fifteen year old is too young to watch this with me in the room, with his friends, yes, that's a different story. I watched it through on DVD the day after Christmas. It was shocking but also quite funny. I suggest any parents of preteens watch this (not the edited version on TV) just so you know what your kids are watching when you are not around. You will laugh and you will be surprised!"
1,YEAH! FInally! The worst film of the millenium!,"I did not know one could write, produce and especially direct a film like this one. The accumulation of unbearable (I hope this film does not reflect the average American suburban precollege teen) nonsense is hardly imaginable. I am really sorry about those people who liked this film and especially two things: a. the dichotomy between explicit verbal sex and the absolute absence of any realistic love scene (I would be very astonished if every single American teen is negotiating his First Time like this). b. the stereotypical image of the east-European girl. Although Nadia was really amazing (but a bit too solarium burnt and silicon breasted for being a Check or Slovakian girl (note for the scriptwriter: there is no Checkoslovakia any more), I wonder why she was the only one who had to get naked (and no American girl or guy)! Well that's it. Thanks for reading and sorry for those who might like the film."
5,so stupid it is funny,"There are good movies and then there are movies like these that are just worth the price for the laugh factor. Yeah it does have a plot a pretty stupid one, but it is so funny. The second one is really funny too. are you trying not to watch things with sex in them or not your kids well do not watch this. this is full of sex references and inuendo. It is really funny and worth the laugh if you are like me and just are not offended."
2,"Ok, gets boring to watch more then once though.","This movie is ok, I own it, but I wished ida saved my money. This is a one time see movie, after that it becomes uninteresting. The comedy in this movie is not witty at all, in fact, it almost insults your intelligence. This is a rent once movie, nothing more."
1,Great movie but DO THE SPECIAL EDITION THE FIRST TIME!,"This movie is funny. I like it. But shady business practices like this are exactly the reason I rarely buy DVDs - asking fans to pony up twice for the same film in the space of a couple years is an insult. I will pay for this film 0 times, give Blockbuster my business, laugh at the movie again, watch the special features, then return it.Can't wait for the 3-disc set! I will rent that at Blockbuster too!"
3,"Good, but it's been done before.","Sure, we've all seen the teen gross-out comedies before this, but one measure up to its charm. What could be funnier than a bunch of high schoolers trying to lose their virginity? Oh, wait, we've seen this plot a million times.That's not to say the movie is bad, just played out. By the middle of the movie you'll begin to predict what will happen to the five friends next.Alot of scenes will make you laugh though. That's what makes it stand out above some of the others, such as ""Porky's."" The intro is worth seeing. The main character, Jim, played by Jason biggs, is caught watching scrambled porn by his mother. He convinced her it was just a nature documentary. ""Jim's Dad"" was made famous by this movie as he continued to involve himself in his son's sex live...It's rated R for strong language, nudity, strong sexual content, and alcohol use. Not exactly a family film. It's worth renting, but be prepared to see the same old shenanigan's you've seen before."
4,"great movie, great extras","I hope you have seen the movie so I will just speak about the extra things on the dvd. There is a great commentary by the director and some of the actors, it makes the move even more hilarious! I also loved the blooper/outakes."
4,Must watch for parents,"Ok, don't take me wrong... I didn't LIKE the movie, I only rate it high because it does genuinly deal with the issues 16-17 year olds deal with in the USA (believe it or not). The movie does have a few moments that made me laugh, but although I was not a participant in such nonsense during my highschool years, I couldn't stop pairing up the events next to those that I did see happen at school.However, in real life, these things aren't as funny. Quite the opposite.If you're a parent in the USA with kids in highschool, you must endure the pain to watch it. It's your duty."
4,funny but stupid,this movie was so dumb that it's funny. it was okay probably the best out of all the american pie movies.
2,Average at best,"OK let's see...4 high schoolers who try to get laid before they graduate. Haven't we been down this road way too many times before? Enough times to know the outcome before the opening credits even finish. Now that we know the plot, let's talk performances. This movie signaled the official typecasting of Jason Biggs as a loser who can't buy a date who ends up a winner in the end(His next movies, Boys and Girls and Loser are basically American Pie ripoffs with less sex with pastry). Mena Suvari, however, was able to put her average performance behind her after her brilliant acting in American Beauty. Simply put other than a few clever jokes and out-in left-field sight gags, American Pie was simply just another oversexed teen flick. You can only beat a dead horse for so long before it's no longer fun,ACS"
4,"VERY Funny, but somwtimes over-expressive","I thought American Pie was very funny, had just enough sex jokes, and had good actors, but eventually, it got tiring. Even though the jokes were funny, after a while they just kept coming in no order at all. After about 40 minutes, it seemed like the movie was trying NOT to entertain, but test the audience, and see how much raunchyness they can take. Although most of the movie was jokes, and not events or plot, the ending and actual events that weren't one big joke, were very entaining, and never dull. I recommend this movie to people who like raunchy jokes, and don't need a plot throughout the movie. In that way, it's sorta similar to Scary Movie, which is MUCH funnier."
5,One of (if not the) the funniest movies of the decade,"Hilarious, better than all other teen comedies or slashers or whatever released recently. See it."
4,Good Clean Fun,"Being a big fan of Mena Suvari, I had to see this. This movie is funny, and at times maybe a bit to gratuitous, but with the believable acting and the all too believable situations, this Pie definitely leaves a good taste in your mouth."
3,Not Quite A Classic,"It feels like warm, apple pie. Or maybe it just feels like rehash.American Pie is the heart warming story of a group of high school friends trying to lose their virginity by prom. I know, it doesn't sound heart warming at all, does it? Well, it tries to be in the last twenty or so minutes, but contrary to what many believe, I don't think it quite worked out.Instead, the film is a fairly honest look at the sexuality that overruns today's teens. Some parts were just outright disturbing, but still funny. This is definitely of the Something About Mary group of gross out films. What it does, however, is succeed when it is not trying to gross you out. The genuinely funniest moments come away from the pie or foamy beer. This is a lesson many script writers could learn.In the end, American Pie is just what it tries to be, a funny teen comedy. What it isn't, however, is a classic like Porky's, which it gets so many comparisons to."
1,Horrible,"I went with a group of friends to see this nuch hyped screenplay, and I can tell you that it was not worth it. I came out disappointed and puzzled that so many people (other college students included) thought this was a great piece.The ""I have to lose my virginity"" line is taken to absurd levels that even made a liberal person such as myself shake her head in disgust.Not even the inclusion of Alyson Hannigan (BTVS) could have convinced me this movie was as good as everybody said it was.I really think the script writters and the directors could have and should have done better. The infamous kitchen scene (from which the title comes from) was something that might have impressed junior high students, but I did not think it was good"
1,American Pie,"The success of this movie leave one wondering...It does show that it does not take a lot to entertain people. The story is about a bunch of teenagers wanting to get laid, and their embarrasing experiences. The movie is very vulgar and relies completely on vulgar humor to get by. The movie DOES have a point but it is sadly lost among the gimmicks and jokes. The movie is highly overrated, I think. I will say only giggling teenagers can find this funny(or people with an incredible juvenile sense of humor). If you think a guy having sex with a pie, a guy drinking a beer that includes manly fluids is funny then this is definately for you."
4,"funny, but not much substance","this is a great teenage movie... there is alot of sexual content in it, but its still funny. i would reccomend it to any high school student who needs a laugh and can relate to the struggles of teens."
2,"Review of the Disc Quality, not the film","I was very disappointed with the Ultimate edition.The picture quality was not very good. It seems to me that Universal were just trying to put too much on one disc, or got very sloppy with the transfer.Peoples skin has the wierd plasma effect that falls just short of the bad Mpeg encoding of early discs.Shame really, as with a DTS soundtrack, one would want crisp sound & crisp piccy.But, film very good."
5,Meat pie or apple pie?,"Sure, it's a dumb movie about guys who want to get laid, but it does invent several characters that you really do begin to care about, so how can you really fault it? The gags are really quite funny, and it's hard to imagine any other situation where a girl could convince her dad that ""there was nothing going on"" by screaming at the top of her lungs ""I'M COMING!!!!"" Another phrase that will never be the same for met again is ""There was this one time at Band Camp..."" The infamous American pie scene is, of course, quite disgusting, but if it had been shared with anyone other than Eugene Levy..."
4,And one time in band camp......,"Man o' man, this is funny. This is the kind of movie that you get the gang over, order a pizza, and just let it loose laughing. A sure crowd pleaser. The plot of high school boys trying to get laid is great. Funny scenes and characters. Great for the collection!"
5,"A sick, funny, twisted and wonderful flick!","This movie blew my mind. I totally expected it to be another teensploitation movie, like She's All That or something like that, but it was intelligent, witty and actually sweet. If I didn't know any better, I could see this movie getting away with being a chick flick. I think teen guys and girls will like it. It's not as gross as everyone says."
3,American Pie,"I felt like an idiot, I bought the DVD thinking it was American Beauty. But, I watched and thought it was hysterical, a high school genre movie, if you liked Fast times at Ridgemont High and Sixteen Candles you will love this. Don't watch it with small children or your mother."
1,American Pie - THE worst comedy film ever made,"this is extremely unfunny, no real jokes except for the usual juvenile filth on offer here. Anyone who even so much sniggers at this abomination is a stupid, uneducated, brainless fool and should be should along with every member of their family."
3,It's OK,"This is not the best comedy, in fact it's only slightly better than most boring teen comedies. It pales in comparison to the likes of Clerks, and animal house. It has little heart, unlike those teen comedies of the 80's, (Breakfast Club). But it has a few funny moments..."
4,A total have to see movie!,"This is definetley one of the funniest, craziest and most enjoyable films I have ever seen. I watched in in the cinema with my friends and it was so good! One of the best movie nights ever...."
1,People pay money to see this?!,"I think this film says more of the insecurities of the film makers than anything else. This film made me realise why many people don't like America, and is little wonder why Americans seem to relate to it. The high school ""dudes"" treat women in the same way that their politicians treat foreign countries."
2,A LIMITED APPEAL,"I agree with Mr. Olson's coments below that the appeal of this film is limited to a certain age range. For those above 25 or 30, this picture may seem tedious, poorly acted, and above all, boring. The laughs are prdictable and are designed to provoke us through toilet jokes and crude sexual references; even to the younger viewer the movie seems to be insuling. Yes, in high school scoring and making out was on my mind a fair amount of time but so were other things: college plans, training to be a professional musician, concerns about my future, etc. I do think sex was either on the mind of those who made the film or they just hought it was what preoccupied all teenagers.The script and dialogue are unconvincing and they are not help by the mediocre acting of most of the cast. I should have rented the movie before purchasing it but was taken in by all the hype surrounding it."
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would,"What a stupid movie! I usually go for those cheesy high school movies about dating/kissing/prom/etc., but this is ridiculous! This movie made me sick. Yeah, kids think about sex all the time, but is it really appropriate to make this kind of movie about it? And everytime I thought I could keep watching just to see how it turned out, they introduced something even more disgusting. I couldn't even finish watching it. Do yourself a favor, don't even start it!"
2,"It sure is American, but a Pie in the face","I really don't get it. High reviews and best-seller for weeks in a row. This is a movie for adults to relieve their frustration for not having experienced life at it's best when they had a chance to. Any teen-ager should look at it with despise and a grin in the face, for they know better. Not much of a comedy, the gags just barely make it. Or maybe it's just the fact that I am not American and missed it all together...Certainly not worth even the ticket for the theater, let alone the DVD price."
1,is this supposed to be a joke?,"It is movies like American Pie that give americans a bad nameNo F****** wonder the world thinks were just horney beer guzzling hormone charged robots.This movie brainwashed high schoolers and preteens into thinking mindless sex and constant partying is just harmless and (reputation speaking) required in High school. Well, i watched my class mates follow the stupid antics that this movie depicts, and one got ran over by a car, and one got his girl friend pregnant(she was a freshman might i add)These are the people who are going to run the country, I pray these people work in factories or go into the military, because if you let these kids go to college, $4,000 is going to go straight down the drain,im not a hard core christian and i know its only a movie, but it did start a revolution of my generation, and it sucks"
2,Hmmmm....,"I almost feel bad typing this...there is nothing new or original here. All of this has been done before. (ie Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, etc) I was actually rather bored by this film...I'm sorry...I guess pastry and internet sex shows don't do much for me. I wish someone would realise that people between the ages of of 13-20 (well, some of us, anyway) aren't really that amused by bodily fluids and flatulence. The performances were very good, very believable, with the exception of Shannon Elizabeth, but I seriously doubt that she was cast for her acting ability. For a more intelligent teen coming of age story, I recommend 'Get Real.'"
5,Never gets old!,"If my husband and I get bored on a Saturday we just pop in the American Pie series. It's so funny how watching these crazy guys try and lose their virginities by prom night never gets old! This movie is also highly recommended for parties, because with a group of people it gets so much more funny!Though, if you are not entertained by crude humor and language then this movie is not for you."
5,you'll never look at warm apple pie the same again...,"Four kids make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. An attempt by Jim on a hot immigrant named Nadia fails sadly. He finds his prom date in a dork from a band named Michelle. Kevin has a girlfriend named Victoria who isn't so intersted in sex. Chris joins the choir and finds a date in a choir girl named Heather. Finch doesn't have a date to the prom due to a suprise bathroom incident.In the end Jim scores with Michelle, Kevin convinces Victoria to score with him, Chris scores with Heather, and Finch does Charlie Stiffler's mother on a pool table.This hilarious tail of high school life is not for the faint hearted. It has funny moments like when Jim does an apple pie and when Finch has diarrhea in the ladies bathroom. Watch this for laughs and love."
2,Is there nothing but sex?,"Absolutely NOT what I expected. This film is really cheap. I must admit there are some really funny parts, but the story is only about sex. I know that this is the theme, but wouldn't it be nice just to have a little story surrounding it? If you are drunk I think you will find this film absolutely fantastic. But I wasn't, and still I had to puke. The end is SO discustingly moralistic, telling that life is not just about sex..... Really made me sick."
3,What's the difference between Ultimate vs Uncut?,I have the 'uncut version'. What is the difference besides dishing out another $25? 5 stars for the movie and 1 star for the marketing genius who is out to suck more money out of the consumer.
5,Hilarious and Intelligent Movie + Great DVD = Awesome Value,"A definate buy--I could go on forever about how funny this film is, but I won't--so I'll just tell you that it's a good movie (Not as Great as Everyone Says), but still worth buying and watching over and over again, and the Unrated DVD version is a must--with a plethora of features, including a very entertaining commentary feature.Buy it!Also Recommended: Se7en, Fight Club, and if you like teen comedies-- 10 Things I Hate About You.ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMENDED: Wild Wild West--I normally don't trash movies--and am generally optimistic, but this film could very well have been orchestrated by Satan himself, and I personally believe that the great director Sodenburgh was possessed by something vehemently evil when he made this movie."
3,GREAT FUNNY Movie - DISAPPOINTING Unrated Version,"I've seen ""American Pie"" a few times. All those times, I've loved it. When the DVD came out, we got the R-Rated version so that we could enjoy the same experience we had in theaters. However, I noticed that the UNRATED version was Number 2 on the list, and the R-Rated version was somewhere around Number 14. So, I rented the UNRATED version.**THERE IS LESS THAN 30 SECONDS OF NEW FOOTAGE IN THE UNRATED VERSION**This kind of ticked me off... My advice, get the RATED version. It's just as funny as it will ever be."
4,Laugh? I nearly wet myself............,"How funny? I was expecting a fairly run of the mill teen flick. All the folks that thought Theres Something About Mary was brilliant (of which I wasn't one) said how great it was, so I watched it as much out of curiosity - and I didn't stop laughing. It is hardly great film making and too be honest so much was predictable and toe curling, but it was such fun. With 1999 being year of the teen gross out movie it is AP that will be longest remembered and go down as a genre classic of it's time. Very silly, very dumb, but brilliantly crafted. It may well be base, and the moral minority may complain about it sex obsession, but it is really harmless fun. Remove your brain, get a big bag of popcorn and enjoy."
5,still laughing,This has to be one of the funniest movies of the year. We had 6 people over (and it was a diverse crowd (male & female ages 25-55)) and everyone loved it. I don't think any of us have stopped laughing yet.
4,Laugh Until It Hurts,"American Pie is an Animal House for the 90's! It is funny enough to make your stomach sore, and has enough story to keep you interested. You will see somebody who reminds you of someone you hated, loved, and made fun of. One thing is for sure this DVD has lots of extras. Get some friends together and rent it....better still buy it, you want to watch it over and over."
4,"Ignore all the bad reviews, this movie is very very funny","What is this, some people out there actually gave this movie a bad review? Why? One person called it a bad example to teens. That it sends a message that it's bad to be a virgin. Please, give me a break. I'm tired of people blaming Movies for everything. This movie is funny. It entertains you. After all that's what a movie is supposed to do right? Entertain not send a message, that's why we have parents. Besides this movie has a big label on the cover which explains that this movie is intended for mature adiences only, you know the kind of audience that doesn't do something just cause a character does it on a movie or T.V. show. To all those haters out there get a life to everyone else own this DVD you won't regret it."
5,"Funny film, about mature topics, with alot of heart!","In todays era of low brow humor it was a true joy to see American Pie burst on to the scene. It may be about the quest of high school boys attempting to loose their virginity by the end of high school, but this film maintains its heart. It is simply the best film ever made about youthfull mature topic matter. Yes, you will laugh from begining to end with this one, but you will also relate to it in some way. In a way, American Pie made me feel seventeen again. Check it out, great film!"
3,Hilarious teen flick,"I HATE teen flicks, but you have to understand something...this was outlandishly raunchy and hilarious. Sickening, disgusting, almost puke out humor. But did I ever laugh! This is a must see. If you don't laugh at this movie you need to loosen up and take life less seriously. Yes, it is raunchy as anything ever, probably the most raunchy movie EVER. But some of the scenes in this film will go down in history."
4,Endearing,"I bought this for my husband knowing it was a favorite of his but keeping my fingers crossed that he wouldn't ever ask me to watch it with him. Based on what I had heard I just knew I would find it too lewd or crude. I finally broke down and I am glad that I did! I really enjoyed it. The characters are so cute, they were all (most of them at least) so endearing and so true to life. True teenagers. I recommend this movie for anyone that wants to laugh. I hate movies that are crude just to be offensive (Baseketball from South Park creators for example) this movie was definitely not crude or cruel. The characters really grow on you and you start to care about them. The story has a purpose."
3,Father-son relationship,"Even though I disagree with the way the movie dealt with the Father-Son relationship (you know, the father shows his son sex magazines!!), I do agree that fathers should be very widely open with their sons taking into consideration different levels of age. One other thing, I don't like the idea of making virginity like the middle east crisis. It is something very simple, and when right time comes, it disappears. We should remove the idea from teenagers' minds."
1,In the running for a spot in the 10 worst ever,"American Pie (Paul Weitz, 1999)availability: in every major video store you can hit with a stickEvery bad thing I dreaded about this brainless, boring, unwatchable movie given the trailers i saw for it was absolutely right. The acting was atrocious, the script was one-dimensional and stupid, the jokes (what few there were) were completely unfunny, and the whole thing stank as bad as the outdoor toilet at a national park. I can't believe I sat through the whole thing. Zero stars. Go rent Porky's; at least there were a few laughs to be found there."
2,A Few Funny Scenes,"Other than a few funny scenes, this comedy is boring. It takes teen movies to about the 12-year old level, so do not expect much. It is one of the most over-hyped films ever. I suppose for those who drink heavily while watching it, it is three stars rather than just two. Don't get me wrong, I generally like teen movies, but this one does not make it."
1,I guess I'm just too stuffy,"because I thought this movie was terrible. I was disappointed to miss this in the theater and was really psyched to see in on video. Even the guy at the video store gave me a five-minute diatribe about this being the funniest movie he's ever seen. I get home to watch it, anxiously awaiting these side-splitting moments and... nothing. I waited the entire movie and got nothing. The jokes were delivered with all the subtlety of a baseball bat to the head, and it seems the producers were banking on the Internet scene to drive their movie. They were obviously right, judging from the number of glowing comments here. Besides that, I already knew most of the big jokes from the previews, and the movie offered little elaboration on the ideas. All in all, this movie is bad on a level previously reached by 200 Cigareetes.Don't waste your time or money."
4,Hilarious,"I had heard this was a good movie, but untill I saw it at the theaters I had no idea just how funny it was. The only thing holding this back from a 5 Star rating is the exclusion of a Full screen version."
2,Contained a handful of hilarious scenes.,"I wasn't that impressed with this movie. I had been told that it was really great and funny. I do admit that there were a few scenes that were very funny that I got a kick out of, but the film still wasn't that good. I wouldn't mind watching some of the scenes again, but most of the movie was forgettable and not that original. American Pie wasn't poor, but it wasn't that good either and seems very overrated. I'm sure some people will like this movie though: it is very funny and outrageous in places."
1,immature antics,"For some reason, this movie didn't make me laugh out loud. It didn't even make me crack a smile. What's so funny about seeing a person screw a pie? I didn't understand why every teenager in the entire world calls this ""one of the best movies ever"". I personally thought it was non-stop immaturity and gave out bad messages to teens (i.e. sex has no reprocussions). If you're looking to be grossed out by a bunch of raunchy oversexed people, go for it, but if you want to remain mature and take your comedy on a different level, avoid this movie."
4,One of the best teen movies ever.,"American Pie is a great teen movie about 4 teenage boys on their quest to have sex before they graduate and they learn how hard it is and I reccommend this movie if you are a teen or a grown-up.This movie also has girls, 5 of them.One is Nadia, the Swedish girl that likes Jim (Jason Biggs) & there's Heather which is Oz's (Chris Kline) girlfriend & Vicky which is Kevin's (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Michelle which is a band geak but likes Jim also.This unrated DVD is the same as the regular DVD so don't waist money and just buy the regular DVD or you can buy number's 1&2 unrated together for a price that's not to high.I think you should see this movie because it's funny and I guess you can learn something about sex and I hope this review is helpful."
3,Ummmmmmmmm!,"Overall the film was quite humorous in places, the scene where the guy is having sex with the apple pie was very funny, espcially when him and his dad were sitting at the table deciding what to tell the mother.A bit corny in places and also a bit praticable aswell but overall not a bad film.My only criticisim is that the lip sink in the first hour was some what to be deisired, maybe it was just my disc, but would be intresting to see if other reviewers had the same thought."
1,Someone help me with this noose!,"Sweet Beejesuz this is one bad movie. I suppose it appeals to an age bracket oh, roughly 14 years and 1 day old to 14 years and three days old. They'd find it a riot. If you're over 14 and still find it funny, get help imediately since you must suffer from retarded development. I'm male myself and like some female reviewers I despise the ida of portraying women solely as sex objects. Y'know if George Washington had realized that his fledging state would get as desperate as this he'd have packed his bags and emigrated to Canada right then and let the British rule America. I still blame the British for starting the whole gawdawful genre with garbage like Benny Hill. Oh hee hee it's all sooooo funny!"
1,American Pie,This movie is totally LAME! I heard all the people telling me they laughed so hard they hurt... I did not see it...The laxative scene was a total ripoff of Dumb & Dumber...I got a couple of mild laughs from this movie but dont WASTE YOUR MONEY on it.. Rent it first unlike me...Wasted 20 bucks..Will never watch again Oh well maybe I can trade it to one of these people who enjoy this garbage!
2,Funny but rude..!,Oh yes it is funny... but in a very explicit extreme way!Now-a-days it is not easy to create a commedy or to make viewers laugh! So it would be very easy to make a cheap type of commedy by building it with a sexual foundation!It is a successful commedy but with zero morality!
5,Good DVD to own!,"This is one of, my favorite comdies Jason Biggs (Jim) Mena Suvri (Heather) Tara Reid (Vicky) this is a comdey about these friends who want to get, laid I wont say anything else but the 2 disc dvd is good, better Deleted Footage which is, funny as ... and the Sneek Peek to ""American Pie 2,"" I want to see that. But this edition is worth buying. So enjoy this. NOT FOR YOUNGER KIDS."
3,Unrated???,"I didn't see the rated version so I don't can't tell you what the difference is. This movie is your basic high school comedy. Eugene Levy does an awesome job as the father who does a great job during all the embarassing scenes. There is one nude scene which shows a girl topless. The language is raunchy as is fitting for a high school movie. However, the language was pornographic when one girl tells what she did during music camp. The unrated version is NC-17."
4,The 90's Version of Animal House,"It seems as if every generation has at least one memorable defy authority and party hearty movie. The late nineities teens have this one and it pretty darn amusing as each of these characters has some memorable character traits about them. In between all the partying, pranks, and sex, there are plenty of moments of human emotion and teenage insecurities. Although alot of teenagers are chasing after sex, they are also indirectly trying to find attention and who they really are. I think it succedes on both counts."
2,Funny...but.....,"...I don't think I could recommend it to anyone without STRONG, STRONG CAUTION. I watched this last night for about the second time, and I still felt the same way about it. It's nothing to rave about, but it DOES have its funny parts. I laughed ALOT. I just thought that some of the scenes were TOO crude...SO crude that I don't think I'd wanna own it, much less recommend it to anyone. If you can handle the raunchy material...and believe me, theres plenty...you'll probably enjoy this one. I dunno. I just don't like alot of toilet/sexual humor. Thats just me. For the rest of you, it will be fun, fun, fun...."
2,"Good Ol' Boys Seeking Sex--Not Whiskey and Rye!""","Four high school seniors make a pact to lose their virignity before college.This is the premise for ""American Pie,"" a phenominally successful comedy that's long on raunch and short on laughs.""American Pie"" has its moments, though. The scene in which Jason Biggs attempts to make love to an apple pie is hilarious; the cheesy ""Arabian"" rock band performing ""Midnight At The Oasis"" at the prom is sensational and what normal male between the ages of 12 and 75 could complain about Shannon Elizabeth's bedroom scene?This new ""ulitimate edition"" DVD is a bit of a sham, since there's little difference between the 'unrated' version and the print released commercially and the special features (deleted scenes, outtakes, commentaries) are by no means worthy of TWO discs!Essentially, ""American Pie"" is a touch of soft corn porn masquerading as a teen comedy and as Paul Mc Cartney once sang: ""what's wrong with that?"""
3,American Pie Unrated Version,"This is almost no different from the original version there is just a change in one of the scenes and an extra line or two. I suggest renting it before you buy it, to see if it is really worth it."
5,I laughed til I hurt,"I pre-ordered the unrated version of this movie because I have not laughed as hard as I did at this movie very often and I wanted to see what they had to cut out. I was let down as far as extra scenes (no, there's no more Nadia than in the original), there's not much more and I personally don't think they should have cut the extra scenes anyhow.What's great about having this on DVD is that you can just sit down and watch a couple of the best scenes. I mean, this is not a movie that will loose a lot if you don't watch it all the way through. It'll be great for parties and whenever you want to laugh your head off. You need to be a teenager at heart, because the comedy is squarely aimed at the coming of age group, but the beauty of this movie is that people like me that have moved on can still relate.Run out and get this if in your face, juvenile comedy amusues you as much as it does me."
3,GREAT Movie but unrated version not different,I saw American Pie in the movie theaters and thought it was a real funny story line. I bought the dvd unrated version and didn't notice much on it that wasn't in the theater version. Just when he is on the kitchen island on top of the pie. That is all I noticed left out of the theater version.
3,"Funny Movie. Nice featurette. ""Unrated"" Edition is a scam.","Yes, the movie is funny and has some hilarious scenes. And yes, it could become the 90's version of Porky's. This could be a new brat pack generation too. But why should I buy this special unrated edition if the extra stuff is barely noticeable? I feel that what I paid was too much. Go for the normal edition and you'll laugh all the same."
4,Rent it...,"While this is clearly a very funny film, it doesn't stand up to even a second viewing. However, if watched in the right environment (i.e. expect South Park, not Hamlet) it can be fun, but try and put you brain into twelve year old mode for the best results."
3,"Funny in parts, but not as good as they say","American Pie has lots of laughs, but it is just a teen movie. I guess that it is, in a way, the Porky's of the 90s. But I was hoping for better."
1,WHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT THIS MOVIE?!!,"I'm 20 years old and I have a very good sense of humor. I like to laugh at things that are truly funny, not stupid stuff. And this movie is definetly not funny, it's stupid. And let me get one thing straight, I'm not against tastless humor. Infact, I like sex jokes and stuff like that. I just don't like the way it's portrayed in American Pie. I simply did not find one thing amusing about this horny teen flick. What's so hilarious about seeing a boy screwing a pie? That's just ridiculous. And the scene in which a guy has sex with his friend's mom on a pool table while playing the song ""Mrs. Kathy Robinson"" is NOT FUNNY!!! I've seen sex comedy films that have been truly funny, but American Pie just isn't one of them."
5,Humping a Pie!,"That is so funny, I can't believe how funny this movie is!I like the sex with a apple pie scene so much....its almost as funny as the bathroom part in Something About Mary! You know the part when the stuff gets in her hair? That is so funny.I think movies are much more funnier now then they used to be, because theres lots of funny sex stuff in them! My parents are stupid because they don't like this movie but I do! Boring old movies didn't have any masterbation scenes in them because they were so old. When the girl masterbates its so hot! I like masterbation. But I don't do it THOUGH! My second favorite movie is American Beauty because it has funny sex stuff too with the lady with her legs up in the air and two masterbation scenes! That's so funny.This is a exellent kids movie for grown ups and kids alike!"
2,It was O.K but really dumb too.,"Now I really don't know about alot of teenagers but I really do not get the point of watching something this stupid, Now I was just in high school recently when this movie was out and sadly alot of teenagers in my school found American Pie to be a role model movie Sad Right! I chose not to view ... this until recently I saw it on video and I was for the most part right some scenes are O.K and the movie is not boring or anything it's just watching two idiot guys trying to get laid is lame to watch and I really do not want to see that the guys in this movie remind me of dopes in school I could not stand who are very childish have no responsibility and are just into having sex not a relationship its like a 90's or some sort of mellenium Porkys immitation movie with a little of Fast times at Ridgemont high mixed in, I dont know you be the judge of it."
1,"Terrible Movie, Best Part The Nudity","This is a terrible movie. I could barely sit through it. The most exciting part was when they showed nudity. I used it as a porno when I needed to masturbate. Overall do not buy, unless you need a low quality porno"
2,Actually gets boring,"This movie just didn't have it. I wanted to love it (and laugh) but it just didn't ring true. Pales miserably compared to recent-year comedies like ""Bowfinger"" and ""There's Something About Mary"", each of which have more laughs in 10 minutes than this whole film does. Don't waste your time."
1,Disturbing Trend,"The hollywood trend continues...that is to say the pandering of film to lower the tastes of film going audiences. This masturbatory mis-adventure about guys who continually objectify women seeks to say that a male adolescent's brain is located too far south of his cranium. The disturbing aspect of it all is that the film was so popular among teens that it seems like a whole-sale endorsement for ignorance. Do you get the fact that what we watch determines little by little who we are? As Hollis Little Creek says, ""Be careful what you advertise on your t-shirts, people might just think that's who you are..."""
1,This film is a feeble punch at the dome of comedy.,Im very disappointed to see veteran comic/actor Eugene Levy waste his time in a piece [like] this. Maybe he needed the money?!?!?!? WHo knows!?!?Stupid film... Thumbs down.
5,The best of its genre!,"This was one of the best teen flicks I have seen since Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Eugene Levy is hilarious as the nerdy horny father who is always helping his son.But I guess I won't be sending any of my kids to ""band camp."""
1,turned off one hour into it,"I was advised by a friend who is in my age group (early 30s) that this is one of the funniest movies ever made. It isn't. I gave it as much of a chance that I could, but once it got to the scene where Nadia the exchange student is undressing on the webcam and pleasuring herself on that dude's bed my suspension of disbelief just couldn't hold out any longer and I shut it off.Look, you can have gross-out scenes and sophomoric sight gags in a comedy all you want so long as you balance it with some smarts in the script-writing. Too much barf and not enough bite. Pass."
1,Don't Like it and I'm not a Straightlaced Religious zealot!,"I don't agree with the guy who said people who don't like this movie are straightlaced religious zealots, I don't like this movie and I'm not a straightlaced religious zealot and I'm no prude, In fact two of my favorite movies are Animal House and There's Something About Mary which I personally think are 100 times better than this movie and prudish religious zealots definitely would not like those crass humor movies, I just don't like American Pie because I just think it's not all that funny and it's not very original, it is a clone of all the other Rated ""R"" crass humor movies that were made before it and an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of There's Something About Mary which kind of regenerated the market for those types of movies not unlike how the successes of When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless In Seattle brought forward a whole crop of romantic comedies!"
1,Bad teenage sex movie,This movie was awlful! Its just a bunch of high school kids trying to get laid. I definetly wouldnt let young kids watch it and I wouldnt suggest renting or buying it
2,stuped and childish,This movie was ok but it was nasy and crazy.I recommend that you dont let your children watch this.But dont see it yourselfh.
5,Hilarious! Absolutely Hilarious!!,"This movie is one of the funniest films ever made! I would have thought it was a movie for guys only, but even chicks dig it too! Everyone with hormones should go out and watch this movie because it is awesome!"
4,Would you like some pie?,"American Pie was not as funny as I thought it would be but overall this film is quite entertaining. Featuring an all-star cast including Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari, Tara Reid, Chris Klein, and Shannon Elizabeth. American Pie is vulgar, frank, and somewhat heartwarming. I have seen all three films and I have to admit the second one is probably the best, but the original is not a total letdown. Defintely one to watch, nothing like homemade apple pie!"
4,Just a quick review,"Well, too bad the UMD format is not popular with PSP owners. It seems that some Movie companies will stop producing them soon. Ohh, well. I love this format.This movie is really very raunchy and funny. It is a great movie for young men and women, feeling the frustration of teen angst, and sexually charged situations. I loved it.I'd also like to give props to the producers for including some (if not all, I'm not sure, as I never saw the DVD release) of the special features, which is a rarity on this format. I hope more companies take note of this.Great effort on this UMD!!!"
4,American Pie: 3.5 stars!,"Four friends Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) all make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. Oz joins a choir in hopes to meet a nice young girl, and he does; a girl named Heather (Mena Suvari). They both hit it off. Kevin wants to show his girlfriend Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum (Tara Reid) he really cares about her and wants to have sex, but neither one are prepared. Prom night comes, and three out of the four guys agree to back off from their pact. They feel that they are pressured to have sex before the night is over.A very funny film, that shows the sexually active young men at their prime. Also starring Jennifer Coolidge as Steve Stifler's (Seann William Scott) mom, and Eugene Levy as Jim's dad. Finch and Stifler's mom are just hilarious together."
2,"Been there, seen that...","This flaccid stab at comedy is basically a mish-mash of ideas stolen of other, better works. If it's raunchy fun you want, try ""Porky's"" or ""Animal House."" If it's a funny look at teen sex/romance, try ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" And if you're into disgusting acts with food, for goodness sake, go to the source: Philip Roth's ""Portnoy's Complaint,"" published in 1969, kiddies."
5,"FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY! The girls aren't bad either!","This is a movie for just about everyone who remembers their days in high school. There is at least one character in American Pie that we can all relate to, be it the band camp girl, or the choir chick, or the plain old foreign exchange student. This movie is raunchy, but that is what makes this an instant classic. What about those awkward father-son sex talk moments? We have all been there! Still not convinced? American Pie is worth seeing at least once just for the 12 minute scene with Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) as she is caught by Jim (Jason Biggs) ah, let's say, ""going downstairs."" And that is not even the best part of that scene! It get's better with naughty Nadia making Jim nervous, as he sorta ""blows it"", so to speak! GET THIS MOVIE JUST TO WATCH SHANNON ELIZABETH! 10 stars if it would let me!"
3,Good but could have been better,"I thought the movie was pretty entertaing, but could have been better. Very funny but with crude acting. Please do teenagers really act like that in high school. The Foreign student Nadia, please do teenagers really act and dress like that."
2,rehash of Porky's,"This teen film makes the obligatory reference to Shakespeare--this time to Henry the Fourth, Part One, in a class discussion led by an Asian-American teacher. (Theere's a battle over Shakespeare in Porky's 2. For other references, see Never Been Kissed, Jawbreaker, The Rage: Carrie 2, and 10 things I Hate About You.) Unlike Risky Business, this film does not offer anything by way of an interesting account of boy teen angst over getting laid for the first time. Another overhyped disappointment. If you really want something sexually explicit (this film isn't), go rent a porn."
1,"lame and insipid, i'm worried about all these 4 star reviews","This was a truly lame movie. There are no laughs here, becauyse the sophomoric high jinks are so clumsily scripted and unbelievable. To have the character sleep with his friends mom and put ""Mrs Robinson"" is not funny, its lame, and it steals from a really great coming of age movie.I'm disappointed to see how many people not only tolerated this film, but embraced it. To say its the POrky's of the 90s is not a compliment as far as I'm concerned..A Christmas Story on the other hand, thas a funny movie. I can not imagine someone buying this film and watching it repeatedly, its just not funny.South Park, Office Space, Being John Malcovich, The Graduate, Airplane, This Is Spianl Tap, these are funny movies, not American Pie--believe me--you can skip it!"
1,a child molester's dream come true,That is all this movie is...a child molester's dream come true. It is a sick way of portraying young girls. This movie is truly degrading to women.
1,Was this supposed to be There's Something about Mary 2?,"This movie had no real point at all. It needs to make up its mind. Is it some sort of film promoting celibacy? Or is it some sort of comedy? Either way, it fails horribly. This movie is not very funny at all, and it tries too hard to be like ""There's Something about Mary"", maybe trying to ride that bus all the way to the bank. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this ""film."""
2,Mildly Funny Teenage Hijinks,"I must say that I was very disappointed in the film, ""American Pie"". Why? Because we've seen the formula done before and done better than it is here. For example: ""Fast Time At Ridgemont High"" and ""Porky's"".Don't get me wrong. I don't completely hate the movie. The actors are very good with the material that they are given. Plus, it is well-directed. Also, there are several very funny scenes in this movie, but as a whole the film just desn't work.Eugene Levy steals every scene he is in as the father who tries to deal with his pastry-porking son.The DVD is nicely done. The picture is good, as is the sound. The film is available in an R-Rated and Unrated version. There is little difference between the two. Apart from the pie scene and a few snippets of dialogue, they are the same."
3,One Of The Most Spoiled Movies In Recent Memory,"I would have enjoyed American Pie much more had I not seen any of the trailers or read any of the reviews. I am not exaggerating when I say that every major scene was given away in the advertising. Still, it's worth a rental, and if you are one of the lucky people that hasn't heard much about it, by all means, check it out.The disc is very well done, even if its extras aren't as interesting as some other Universal Special Editions. The commentary track is very funny."
3,Stupid yet unavoidable and hilarious,Movies like this one are filled to the brim with tasteless gags which leave your side hurting because of the laughs. Yet this raunchiness shines much better in films like Fast Times At Ridgemount High and Caddyshack. I found the film to be highly enjoyable but it seemed like it was written by a middle schooler and not a professional. I know not to take the film so seriously after all that is the point of these movies. It just seemed like new gags in a constantly repeated formula. It's a great rent. Don't be dissapointed if you can't find the unrated one because I couldn't tell the difference between the two. Its the same R rated film almost. It's a lot of fun though.
4,Bringing High School Home...,"This film had me reminiscing about my own High School days. So much of every teen's post-graduation experiences are right here in this hilarious and touching movie. From the awkward parent-child talks about the birds and the bees, to the sporty jocks boasting of conquests never made, American Pie is one of the most right-on-the-money teen flicks you'll ever see. And one thing is for sure...you'll never look at apple pie the same way again."
3,Okay...,"I saw the censored version of American Pie and it's really gross.I knew it would not exactly be a *Disney* type of movie, but I did not even expect it to be soooooo gross. There's this time when one of the guys tries to kinda make love to a pie. I mean, they have thought of some of the weirdest and grossest things. Some parts are cool and it is quite natural, I suppose, for guys to wanna make love and maybe the theme of the movie wasn't so bad, but they didn't portray it very well. It's about these guys who really wanna make love, but they don't get the right girls or the right opportunities. But when one of the geekiest kids in school claims to have made love to a hot girl, they decide they've had enough. They make a pact that they'd have lost their viginities by the time they graduate. It's about how they find the right girls and how they do it. It's a good movie, but REALLY gross in parts."
5,Funny movie. Not for the kids though,"Teenage sexual lust and angst. Does it really get any better. As I noted for the unrated version, the pie scene in this version (rated) is funnier than the pie scene in the unrated version. Basicly the whole gist here is 4 guys trying to loose their virginity before graduating high school. Parties, lots of alcohol and a new phrase, milf. Don't know that one? Just watch the movie. The laxative scene is pretty hilarious too. Great guy type humor."
1,Boring,"I like to see films that are shocking, insightful, new, genuinly funny or beautiful. This film is neither. I have seen both the R-rated version and the Unrated version (the fact that the latter was rated NC-17 is further proof of the MPAA's ineptitude) and both are tiresome. This being Hollywood, even the ""nerds"" are ""hot"". There are no imperfect people in this world. The film tries be offensive and gross you out; and then at the end the producers try add some morality into the film. If your going to make a film about bad-taste - have the balls to go all the way. If you are looking for gross-out comedy, try picking up a film by John Waters or Peter Jackson."
5,It's the funniest movie of the decade!,"This has to be the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. It tells you what every teenage boy is thinking about! It is, however, very sexually explicit - so be prepared. I would recommend this film to any adult, though. If there is a mom out there who wants to know what their teenage son is thinking about, this movie explains it all."
4,High School ambitions,"The sript has condensed a lot of High school sexual fantasy and reality into a worthy film. It's refreshing that much of this stuff is related in the perspective of students and free of any real inhibitions. The film has an R rating, and interestingly, a 15 year old rating in the UK. (For the content of this film I think the UK rating is more appropriate) There is a lot to be learnt from watching this film both for parents and kids. Nearly all the principle students play positive role parts reinforcing what is normal and healthy in growing up, and relationships. The script is occassionaly hilarious, often funny, mostly humorous and never heavy. An upbeet film if ever there was one, and obviously enjoyed by a lot of moviegoers as it has raked in over $160m so far."
3,Not Much of a Difference in My Opinion,"What was the point of releasing an unrated version of this movie? The only scene that was added was Jim on the counter with the pie (and this was included in the outtakes of the rated version). Plus, the scene in the beginning involving Jim's dillema of what kind of Jim, Nadia would go for, wasn't included. To me, there wasn't much of a difference between versions. The movie itself is one of my all-time favorites and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't already seen it. It's just that there was too much hype surrounding this ""unrated"" version. My advice, go with the rated version instead."
3,ultimate....,"Ok, so when are the people at Universal going to release their final versions of DVD releases first? I don't see why they make us buy one version one year then a better version the next. I love this film and enjoyed the extras on the first printing, but please...Universal, stop with the dual prints! If you print one collector's, make it a collector's edition. Not a preview to a better version of the same disc."
2,Unrated!,"Don't believe the hype. The unrated version you couldn't see in theaters? Please! About 1 minute of 1 pair of breasts is the only nudity in this film. Funny at times, but if you think you're going to see something that wasn't in the theater you'll be really disappointed."
5,"Great movie, but don't waste bucks for this version.","I thought the movie was great in the threatre and it's super at home. The only annoying, thing and I wish I knew this before I wasted the extra ten bucks. Is that the unrated version, is almost exactly like the standard version. You would have to watch the two side by side to see the differences."
5,American Pie,My boyfriend and I loved this movie! I don't think I've ever laughed out loud that hard in a theater. We found ourselves comparing the characters to people we knew is high school. I rate this movie right at the top with Something About Mary. Beware... not for the prudish.
4,Funny Teenage Romp,"This is this decades teenage funny movie. There are parts of this movie you will never forget. I currently have fond memories of flutes, and I was never in band. But now I wish I had been...(See the movie, you'll understand why.)A funny movie...the new ""Fast times at Ridgemount High""."
2,This movie gets really boring!,When I first saw American Pie in the theater I really enjoyed it. I laughed so hard at every scene. I brought it on DVD and video and I still liked it. But now that I have seen it a million times it has gotten stupid. Becareful when you buy it on video because it's a hard decision on which American Pie version you want to get. The unrated version is okay but I like the original better because it's the way it meant to be. If you hadn't seen this movie yet you would probably like it for your first time but if you watch it a million times you might think it's a stupid movie. So becareful when you watch it a bunch because you might not like it anymore. But it's still a good movie though. Try it for your first slice!
4,Don't choke on your popcorn!,"American Pie is in a word, funny. It's a little crude at times,which didn't bother me at all,but might offend prudish types. This movie isn't for everybody but it's got numerous major laughs. For a teenage romp kind of film, it's way above average! This movie has that ""teen noir"" quality....sorta.Eugene Levy is excellent as a bewildered father and the young cast of mostly new-comers who play the teenagers are impressive.The girl who keeps saying ,""last summer at band camp we..."",is a scream! Pop the Popcorn and prepare for a good time,just don't choke on your snacks whilst laughing! AMERICAN PIE is delicious...."
5,Funniest I've seen in a while.,When I first went to see this movie I had never even heard of it. I actually went to see another movie but the theater switched at the last minute. I was not disappointed at all. From the very first seen I was lmao. It's been a long time since I saw a comedy that had the whole theater in tears. Naturally I bought it as soon as it was realeased on video. Only thing negative I can say is it was kinda unrealistic. C'mon a senior jock who is still a virgin! Any senior who is still a virgin for that matter....
1,"Flat-out stupid, not to mention bad teen comedy","""American Pie"" is just another rehash of teen sex comedies, rating up with ""Porky's"" as one of the most worst films of the last two decades.Three sex-crazed teenage boys make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. (See the similarities?) They then start to plan how to do it, starting off with many dirty nauseatingly raunchy sex jokes (masturbation, sexual orientation) that aren't even funny and it goes downhill from there.""American Pie"" is stupid, raunchy, and crude, to say the least. If you people think this is hilarious, I suggest you consult a psychiatrist. Only Alyson Hannigan gives a good performance, while the others fail miserably.Rated R for crude sexual humor, language, and for some nudity."
5,Bulls-eye,"What can I say? It's simply the best teenage Porky's style movie! Seen it 4 times in the movies! Buy it, you wont regreat! Ps- be sure to correctly use your SHERMINATOR!"
2,Immature,"If you are an adolescent and have no maturity or taste, this is the movie for you. It is disgusting, perverted, and full of jokes about bodily functions. It is slightly humorous but has an odd plot- who can have sex before the end of high school?"
2,"Juvenile, stupid; mildly funny.","This is a horrible, mindless, stupid teen flick. The plot is simple, disigned around adolescent jokes. Four friends make a bet to loose their virginity before prom, and of course we are treated with an bunch of ""funny"" situations along the way. This not entertainment, this a third rate comedy, its great box office success can only be credited to the beautiful cast and to a society of apes. If you have self respect, please stay away from this evil evil film. Its for your own good."
2,"Pure, unadulterated band camp","potty brained swill. Perhaps I am being too kind. OK, I rate it two stars because I actually laughed a few times. But it's not funny, it's really sad. Predictable, gratuitous pubescent trash. But I am wasting my typing because it's obviously the level of much of the American pubic . . er. .public."
2,NOT TOO BAD,"Okay I am not big on juvenile humour. But there were parts of this film that were just too funny to ignore or not laugh at. I particularly enjoyed all the parts with Eugene Levy (Jason Biggs's dad in the movie), who is always hilarious. I don't think there is a lot I can say about this film because everyone has already seen it. I can say though that I would not watch this with... my parents (even though I am an adult). The humour, while funny, can be embarrassing. But you will nevertheless laugh unless you are a serious prude and easily offended. Which obviously I am not."
1,Just so over-rated,This may be one of the most over-rated movies of the last 20 years. It is typical mindless skirt chasing by high school boys. How many times will this premise be used before people stop watching it?? Please god stop.Thank you
3,In real life he would have killed himself,"Oh man this guy is just a straight up loser. In the opening scene his mother catches him with a sock. Later his dad catches him raping a pie, he prematurly 'blows it' twice with a worldwide audience watching him, he finally decides that he hates sex while still a virgin.Well sex comedies have come a long way, but this was a bit ridiculous. When I was in high school my mom caught me in my room with a girl, and I got caught by the cops with another girl in a car. That's real life and it can be funny. It's a bit stupid to film a guy going down on a girl with a homemade instruction manuel.Stiffler saves this movie. If I had to choose a girl on here to do, it would be the band chick."
1,Hated it!,"I'm sorry, but I loathed this movie. I thought it was vulgar and even more damning, not the least bit funny. It sort of scares me that we're raising a generation of kids who mistake humor for the gross-out one-note ""jokes"" of AMERICAN PIE and SCARY MOVIE. This one made me want to wash my hands and go watch an old Cary Grant/Katherine Hepburn movie. Or at least something genuinely funny like ANIMAL HOUSE!"
2,Yawn,"I don't see why people are raving about American Pie. It's pretty much a yawn. Add two stars if you are 15 years old, but then you shouldn't be watching it. So, I don't know for whom this movie was intended. It's an R-rated teen flick with a few sophomoric toilet gags. On the plus side, the movie did not try to preach moral values or the evils of sex; the situations were more true to life and the acting was pretty good. On the bad side, it lacked creativity and original humor except for a few chuckles here and there. It would have been funnier if they edited it down to half an hour."
3,typically american,"I don't get it. Why are Americans so nervous when it comes to sex. There's even a rated and unrated version of this movie. There was some nudity visible, but that's about it. Maybe this explains why the movie wasn't a big hit in europe. Anyway if you're a european and you had a normal teenage/highschool period, this movie isn't a lot of fun."
3,XO is cool,"I like just about anything and everything that Elliot Smith sings, but well, this CD just wasn't what I was expecting after becoming passionately attached to Either/Or. There's more production involved in this album and the melodies didn't stick with me as much as in Either/Or. My boyfriend really enjoyed its subtle harmonies and productions compared to other albums."
3,Good but not up to expectations,"I was looking around on Amazon to see if I could scrape in any more Jeff Buckley material but saw that many people buying J.B were into Elliot Smith. So....I decided to buy XO and see what the fuss was all about. Ok, so in all the album is quite good but I found it didn't quite live up to my expectations. He has a steady voice but I found it lacked a passion (not like J.B's - who's can match it???). I also found the voice somewhat monotonous after a few tracks, all songs, bar a few, seem to follow the same melody. My recommendations? Go buy Jeff Buckley's ""Grace"" and ""Sketches...""....NOW."
5,Wonderful,This is a simply wonderful and beautiful album. One of the best albums of the 90s. All the songs are special in their own special way. The absolutely breathtaking and emotional 'I didn't understand' ends an absolutely breathtaking and emotional album.
5,just amazing.....elliott is gods gift to the musical world,"I can't even express how much I love Elliott's music...the way it makes me FEEL, its just incredible...the way he weaves in horns, guitar, and his voclas and lyrics...its like a fine wine, sorry for the cliche but if he asked me to marry him today I would be foreced to."
3,"Not as good as his indie stuff, but still good...","sorry to all of you who love this album but it's just not as strong and passionate as his previous albums. Coming from a devoted Elliott fan that's a pretty scathing review. Though, I do love ""Baby Britain"" and the fun to play on your own guitar ""Bled White"": ""I may not seem quite right, but I'm not f***ed, not quite..."""
5,Breakthrough album,"It is a testament to Amazon and the power of the internet that this album is doing so well. Elliott Smith is no pop icon - he is shy and has little stage presence. However, word about the quality of his music is spreading, allowing thousands of people around the world to appreciate the best album of recent times. This is an extraordinary piece of work - compelling melodies, layered harmonies and hard edges. The lyrics convey a sense of loss and human frailty. If you haven't done so, buy this album... oh, and spread the word."
5,Life Altering Album,"This CD is on my top five list of greatest albums of all time. I could listen to it over and over again without ever tiring of it; it's just that amazing.Some other reviewers have pointed out that some of Elliott's songs contain certain elements of stuff by the Beatles, Nick Drake, etc., and they're right, for the most part, but Elliott also adds a beauty to his songs that's all his own, and no music fan should miss out on it.One track on this CD that really stands out for me is Pitseleh. Everything about it is perfect, from the melodies, to Elliott's voice, the lyrics...This is not to say, of course, that the other songs are inadequate, quite the contrary, it's just that Pitseleh is particulary wonderful to me.So, that said, now go out and buy this album!"
5,Subtle Improvment on earlier material.,"XO is another amazing release by Elliot Smith, if you already own one of his albums then you should be almost certain of how good this album is but if your new to the music of Elliots Smith then for the most part excpect acoustic guitars and folk playing/vocals. This is an improvment from his amazing earlier material though is not quite as good as figure 8 but i still recommened this as one of the albums from his discography that any music fan should own."
4,"It is Elliott Smith, but he has done better.","A brilliant piece of work this is, songs such as ""Oh Well, Okay,"" ""Waltz #2 (XO),"" and the wonderfully a cappella ""I Didn't Understand"" (coming interestingly right on the tail of ""Everybody Cares, Everybody Understands"" a pattern that is repeated in ""Figure 8"" with such pairs as ""Everything Reminds Me Of Her"" and ""Everything Means Nothing to Me"" and etc.) are as good as anything that has ever been written by anyone ever, with the exception of Mr. Smith's own ""Angeles,"" one of the five best recordings ever.The album does have it's worse points, however. The saxaphone in ""A Question Mark"" is simply annoying and I've never been to hot on ""Independence Day."" However, interestingly, I rather like ""Amity,""....P>This is not the best Elliott Smith, I would leave that for ""Either/Or"" or ""Elliott Smith"" itself, but you can never go wrong with an album by our dear friend E.S."
5,A sad day!,"Elliott Smith was one of the most innovative singer/songwriters of our time. His lyrics complimented his musical prestique in ways that few musicians rarely discover. I was turned on to Elliott a few years ago and have been deeply moved by his music ever since.It is hard to face the death of someone so talented and gifted. There was often so much pain in his lyrics, but they seemed to be laced with a hint of optimism. Perhaps what was most unique about his style, was that he was open with his feelings and layed them out throughout his music. At times he was brutally honest, but that is something that I really appreciated.You may never know how you will be missed Elliott. I don't understand entirely why you decided to leave, but know that your time here was not in vain. It seems you have impacted many lives, including mine. Thank you."
5,awesome and holds up amazingly well,"I wasn't expecting the quality of Elliott Smith's XO to be *this* consistent and absolutely terrific.You can hear a variety of influences such as the Beatles, Van Morrison, Big Star, etc.It would probably be fair however, to note that Elliott Smith took those influences and turned himself into a highly talented musician who formed a distinct style of songwriting. You will be able to identify Elliott Smith immediately upon hearing these songs, and that's a great thing.In the end however, you'd be hard pressed to find an album more consistent, highly enjoyable, diverse, and just listenable than XO. A masterpiece this one most certainly is."
5,5 star,I am gonna keep it simple. If you like good music and you havent listened to any of Smith's work do not hesitate to buy this album. I started with his first album and worked my way onward to the last one released. I recomend all of his work.
5,"lush and baroque, poppy and sweet, I'm in love again","This reminds me of sitting on my orange-shag rug circa 1977, listening to my mom's recrords and dreaming of growing older and falling in love. Smith's sweet melodies and lush, baroque stylings catapault me back to the oh-so-sweet time when Simon & Garfunkel, the Beatles, and Nick Drake's hymns set the soundtrack to a life in wonder. The sugar-sweet melodies carried by poppier rhythms stick in your bones, while the darker, ethereal tunes stick in your chest. Imagine...music that makes you feel!"
5,listen to it,"XO is an artfully arranged collection of enjoyable music. rarely leaves my cd player, and always seems just right."
5,"Tender, nostaligic, haunting","The main theme of this charming novel is how important it is to understand the irretrievable passage of time and to savor the good times that come along. The narrator tells the story of an enchanted summer he spent in Cornwall uncovering an ancient painting in a country church. He looks back upon this time (1920) as one of the most wonderful, important periods of his life. He meets several villagers who make an indelible impression upon him and pleas with us to appreciate our own little ""months in the country""--those days when things are going well. Such a good, kind, fully-alive character. I was moist-eyed by the final pages (it's a very short novel) and didn't want it to end. Sweet, powerful, and as lovely as a summer day in the country."
4,"Lyrical, poetic escape",When I was reading this book I often felt as if i was either there or the author was telling the story directly to me. My only objection is that it was too short!
5,"Realistic, low-key, authentic, moving","This is a gem - a quiet and realistic recounting of a summer spent uncovering a mural and a life. This is a novel in which nothing extraordinary happens, but full lifes interact moving people closer (or father) from themselves, friendships, loves and human understanding.The narrator is a disfigured veteran of World War I. His wife has left him; his employer retired making this his first job as a self-employed professional. His life is contrasted with that of another veteran hired to find an ancient grave. The friendship of the veterans is the first step in reconnecting to the world. Along the way, a vicar and his wife, the family of the stationmaster, an organist, a dying girl all make their way into and effect the narrator's life.The author's writing style fits perfectly with the story, creating a literary gem worthy of your attention."
4,Nothing lasts forever,"One of those books that leaves you with a sense of loss when finished, wishing the author had written a sequel, but knowing there should be no sequel (sort of the point of the story, really). A short fiction, seemingly not about much, but an engaging writing style; and several surprises crop up during the short time the narrator spends in Oxgodby, working on restoration of a medieval chancel painting. As you get into the feel of the period (1920 village/rural northern England), you begin to see what has disappeared, for better or for worse, and you realize the surprises in the story really shouldn't have been surprising at all."
2,Slender in size and content,"Yes, it was nominated for a Booker but so were lots of other rather unremarkable novels (and a few objectionable ones, which this isn't). Nothing much happens and the English country atmosphere is not nearly as strongly evoked as in Elizabeth Goudge's books about recovering from war trauma eg ""Pilgrim's Inn'."
5,Much About Nothing,Possibly one of finest books I've read in years. J.L. Carr writes a compelling story with almost no plot. Hard to believe so much can be written with so little action. Don't wait for the movie. :-)
4,Time well spent,"This is a novel about the restorative power of nature and simplicity; slowing down to nature's speed. Two soldiers of WWI come to the Vale of Mowbray to work at a church: one restoring a mural and the other excavating the grounds in hopes of finding the remains of family member of their patron. This is a slow moving bucolic story, filled with passages so finely written that the reader is compelled to stop and re-read and contemplate. The characters are well drawn as is the sense of time, place and community. This is one of those novels that leave the reader wanting to relocate to the setting of the narrative - in this way it was not unlike "" Cranford ."""
3,No Sports,Disappointed that it didn't contain any information on collecting sports stars autographs. Will have to purchase another one for that information
5,It is about time,"There are no more precious artifacts in human history then the primary sources dealing in the written word. Historic letters, manuscripts and documents are the cornerstones of civilization and the best ""collectible"" investment on the market. For all too long the ""Autograph"" Ephemera field has lacked a true and consistant indicator of signed letters, manuscripts and documents value until this new issue of Sanders Price Guide. When a client calls me and asks what the value is of an autographed document I now refer them to this Price Guide - Period. Hats to Richard Saffro, Jim Smith and the Price Guide Researchers.Stan KlosEstoric.com"
4,"Excellent first effort, but not their best album","This collection of Cub songs, while great, doesn't quite stand up to their later releases. The production isn't very good, with the vocals buried in the mix and everything lacking high-end definition. The songs tend to be on the short side, which reminds of early They Might Be Giants. Still, the songs are well written and the simple guitar-drums-bass setup works well for them. The guitar is more often done without any effects at all, and the singing is a bit off-key at times, but this doesn't detract from the songs.If you're a Cub fan, you should get this album, but if you haven't heard them before, you should get their later releases."
3,I don't really care,"I gave this cd a 3, as in to be neutral because to be honest I don't really care. Yes, I may think some of the songs are destroyed and yes some of the singing is not great and yes the kids may not understand the messages of these songs, but also it doesn't really matter. I am perfectly fine downloading the originals of all my favorite songs and letting kids have at it with this cd. If it is going to make kids happier to be able to sing along with other kids who recorded their own version then so be it. It kind of makes me happy to know that kids can enjoy the music of the time without being exposed to all the er negative language. So as long as nobody forces me to listen I am fine with it."
5,great CD!,I love this cd. I love every song on the cd. Caught Up is a great song. How can you say this cd sucks!? This is one of my greatest presents ever! It is not a waste of money.
1,Please dont get this,Do not buy this for your children it will corrupt thier minds! Please for the sake of the children!
1,DISGUSTING!!!!,"I hate these little kids singing about stuff they don't even know about! With trashy lyrics! The songs were bad to begin with but now....In the next album they ruined FEEL GOOD INC! What are they going to do for the cussing part?! Their high little chipmunk voices....Ew. They don't even know what they are singing about. I want to strangle all of them. I can't imagine those artists letting the kidssing their songs. I just can't say how much I hate them. If I could give this 0 stars, i would."
1,"First 9/11, now another kidz bop cd?!","first come 9/11 then the terrorists set us with another kidz bop cd and they actually made 9 of these! when are the people at kidz bop gonna realize they suck a**. Plus the 9nth one will definitley piss off Green Day fans by singing Wake me up when september ends. For all u people who like kidz bop, u r retarted to like this. It sucks because their voices havent changed and they are high pitched plus their advertising campaign is so horrible. Kidz bop, u suck, take this from a kid who thinks all of u totally suck. If they stop making these cds, than it will be an early Christmas 4 us. Thats why i give u one star."
1,Eggplant is the man!,"This abysmal series smoked donkey nuggets since day 1 os the first disc. I'd review this further, but Eggplant wrote what I was gonna say. Go buy ""Rhythm of Time"" by Jordan Rudess instead."
1,Awful! :(,"Kidz bop is horrible. This is the worst cd ever! These kids have no talent, and the adult singers are like rejects from american idol. The kids aren't even singing in most of the songs, they're yelling! These songs are NOT kid friendly, if you've seen them on mtv. If you want these songs by the REAL artists, go to www.walmart.com and download them. Also, get Now 19 and Got hits 2 which are cds with a whole bunch of songs by the REAL artists. The only reason that anybody buys Kidz Bop cds is to make them laugh at how horrible they are."
1,Example of a trend that NEEDS TO STOP!!!!!,"Britney Spears sucks.Good Charlotte/Simple Plan/Blink-182 sucks.Fake R&B; superstars suck. (not all are)Rap sucks. (only Snoop, Dre, and Nas are accepted)But THIS my friend, tops the list.First, we have crappy songs.Then, to top it all! ALL! THE ONE THAT IS WORSE.So, what could be worse than a sl.ut like Britney?KIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UGH!!!It terrifies me. They ruined these songs! Now, I don't mind the runing some of those fakes, but mocking Gwen Stefani, Kelly Clarkson, etc. BUT FRANZ FERDINAND!!! This just flat out pis-ses me off.Not only is it 1-star, it's negative! -100000000000000 stars!!!Awful.Don't buy it!!!"
1,what in gods name were they thinking?,"iv herd howler monkeys sing better than kidz bop! WTF WERE THEY THINKING!? most of there songs were bad to begin with. its all mostly pop crap. i feel sorry for green day and u2 and other serton bands. i dont feel sorry for all the pop artists though. and one more thing to say. if kidz bop is so ""unpopular"", than why dont they stop making kidz bop albums?! and why cant they WRITE THERE OWN SONGS?!?!?!?!?!?"
1,Kidz Bop is really stupid,"Take a bunch of songs meant for teenagers. have some talentless 8 year olds sing the same songs and ruin them, and stick them on an album. Stop airing your stupid commercials on telivision because nobody wants to buy Kidz Bop! It's really bad and pointless. Just stop releasing CD's, take your commercials off telivision, EVERYTHING!"
1,I have the lineup for the new Kidz Bop Album,"I have been informed from someone who works with the executives of the Kidz albums and he gave me a list of the songs being considered for a new ""Classic Rock Style"" Kidz Bop album. Enjoy!1. Led Zeppelin-Houses of the Holy2. Beatles- I Wanna Hold your Hand3. Eagles-Hotel California4. Jimi Hendrix- Foxxy Lady5. Rolling Stones- Its Only Rock and Roll (But I Like It)6.

Iron Maiden- Run to the Hills19. David Bowie- Ziggy Stardust20. Def Leppard- Pour Some Sugar on MeAwsome lineup for the new Kidz Bop album,Am I Right!?"
1,Terrible,"I think that these are the best songs ruined by the worst group of singers. I would give it 5 stars if the REAL singers performed the songs, but nNOoo! They just HAVE to be sung by little kids who can't even sing!!!!"
1,what is wrong with people ?,who ever came up with kids bop is so dumb who could think they could get stupid kids to sing some good songs it totally ruins the music.die kids bop!
1,Bad Cd,"Yes, all of the songs on this cd are bad.....i just had to listen to one sample and see the commercial...However, all this nonsense about Boulevard of Broken Dreams being better on this cd is retarded......the original one is 50000x better than any Kidz Bop version. Yes, most of these songs are not meant for children so get the originals........Also for parents, Metallica, Led Zepplin and other artists are way better than this and contain no profanity."
1,1 star is 5 stars above what it should be rated.,"kids bop is terrible, everyone hates it. The music on this CD is made even worse than it was in the first place(with the exeption of a few songs) Why would anyone buy this? I got this waste of a CD for my birthday and broke it after skimming through 3 songs,which i hated.I do not recommend this terrible CD, put your money into something more useful."
1,It has an f-word?,"I can't believe it! This children's CD has cuss words! Kidz Bop has become an aldultrated Kidz Bop, which doesn't make sense. Heh, not long til they put a Lil jon song. Boy, have I seen Judgement Day!"
1,I can't stand this,"My 4 year old sister listens to this in the car and me and my brother want to explode! WE hate hearing songs we know (and a few ones are good) song by kids with NO TALENT! If you look at the booklet in the CD case it says the last names of the original artist but you DO NOT hear there voices in the songs! I always complain to my mom that she bought it. ITs torture!!! I alos don't see why people don't buy the original cds. Who cares if they hear a bad word there are a million other words in the song. So everyone should chill about that and if they want there kids to listen to songs on the billboard charts buy the original artist's album! And if you don't want your child to hear 'bad words' by them albums with songs like the ""farmer In the dell"" and ""twinkle Twinkle Little Star!"" It's that easy!"
1,HORRIBLE!!,"This cd sounds like a bunch of 8-year-olds screaming. I like most of the original songs, but they are sung increadible badly by young kids. Most of these songs are meant to be sung by only one person, but the ""Kidz Bop Kids"" have about 10 people singing them at once. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!! I'd give this 0 stars if I could, but there isn't an option for that."
1,Oh My God...,"People actually buy this? The original versions of these songs are much better. Whichever company makes these cds need to STOP.This Cd is nothing but an insult to the stellar artists who originally recorded and sang these songs. Please, don't buy this junk that costs money. Instead, if you like these songs, buy albums from the original artists."
3,It's okay,There was a lot of yelling of the words instead of singing of the song. My daughter didn't enjoy it at all.
1,One of the Worst CD Ever,"The whole Kidz Bop Kidz idea is horrible.If you wan't your kids to listen to kid-appriote songs, then check out Radio Disney, or something similar, NOT this. These songs are definetley not meant for kids. I wouldn't want my kid to listen to songs about infedility, and sex, or songs filled with curse words, even if they are bleeped out. Just because they're sung by kids doesn't make it kid-friendly.And if you'll let you're kid listen to this type of music, don't buy Kidz Bop. Buy something like the Now series, that actually sounds good, and isn't just a bunch of off-key kids and an American Idol reject.Only buy this if you want songs that are definetly not kid appropiate, sung by horrible singers."
1,What is WRONG with some people?!,"I have heard the commercials and read 75 reviews about ""kidz bop."" I think, YOU STINK ON ICE! I listened to Green Day's Boulevard of Broken Dreams in 2 ways: 1. American Idiot 2. Kidz Bop 8Kidz bop 8 stunk! Listen to the samples, there is a BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG difference. In Kidz Bop 8 (or should i say ""baby bop 8"") they SCREAM the words. In American Idiot, Green Day sings it. That sounds much better than those baby bop kidz. My point is, don't even TRY kidz bop! Take my word 4 it!P.S.- Please, amazon.com, make it so you can rate things 0 stars!I would've if you could!"
1,oh no...not again.,"Just when you think it's over.Just when you think it's okay to watch TV again.*long scream*KIDZ BOP 8!!!!!!!!first of all, to all the people who say it's cute that they sing about sex, I honstly hope you're being sarcastic. That's the only reason I can think of that you would actually say that.Boulevard of Broken Dreams in on a CD with the dreaded Parental Advisory label. And now, it's on a CD, fore kids, being sung by kids. No Parental Advisory. I do believe I make my point."
1,o_o Save me world....,"The first or second Kidz bop was cute and fine. Now it's out of control. Hearing girls yelling out lyrics of Green Day's 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams' and Avril Lavigne's 'Nobody's Home' is worse than Hilary Duff yelling them out.They say these songs are kid approiate. Even through the songs listed above are some of the best songs this band and artist have sang so far, their best for tweens and up, being about being alone and losing hope. And many of the others are apparent without explanation.Stop the Bop and give the dignity of these songs back to who they're meant to be sang from, and that's the ones who sang them originally!"
1,WARNING TO ALL PARENTS:,"Warning: If you are a parent and you want to give your kid something that both you and him/her can agree on, then get classic bands like Led Zeppelin or the Beatles, even Green Day or U2.2nd Warning: If your kid asks you for this then disown the child and lock YOURSELF in a jail for twenty five years. Because that child is a freak of nature and god knows what you, the parent, did to that poor kid to make him so messed up that he'd want KIDZ BOP!Enough said."
1,This has to stop,"Oh my! Another kidz bop disc? Why am I not at all surprised? This really must stop. I'm floating on the fringes of sanity as we speak. Plus, I'm running out of clever insults."
1,"Kidz Bop, the crap never ends","Every since i was young, i've see this advertised and every time i say 'get a life to THE KIDZ-BOP KIDS' all the songs are just being used like their bubble-gum pop! Boulevard of Broken Dreams, is so much more than just some stupid kids singing it, because NONE of them, would actually know what it means if you read the lyrics. they shouldn't be singing rock/punk music or anything music for that matter on here. it insults the music world. i hate this kidz bop- they should be put out of business long ago. but they still buy it cause they wanna be 'cool' well get a life. people if you like that, you'll be so surprised when you actaully hear the musicians sing it when you BUY their CD, which you should have done in the FIRST place. it's such annoying. dont buy this, please just don't buy it, anything else is BETTER than this."
1,damn! it's like my 7-yr old brother and his friends making a mix tape!!!,"I just can't believe people buy his! It's like my little brother and his friends screaming in front of the PC microphone with the original songs as background music. They're just killing the artists. Green Day, U2, Avril Lavigne, Franz Ferdinand, Kelly Clarkson....there's no way I would ever enev consider about buying this thing.Are you people really gonna tell me that these kids can sing? I bet they're just a bunch of kids whose parents aren't working and they need money for food!!Please don't even try the music sampler, or your ears could suffer pretty serious damage, I mean it, that's what's happening to me now!!!"
1,"RIP, bright future of music","For the one billionth time, if you want to listen to these songs, buy the originals or download them. Seriously, they made one of my favorite bands, Green Day, look like a pile of horse dung. Here are some artists that are JUST more talented than Kidz Crap:D4L (beats it by 0.0000000000001%)Mike Jones (Who? Mike Jones!)Paul WallYing Yang Twins50 CentDem Franchise BoyzChingyNellyOKAY WE GET IT!!!!!!!Because its 2006, anyone can get a record deal. But seriously, Kidz Bop needs to be taken down once and for all. Hopefully Vol.9 will be the last."
1,Oh yay. Kidz Bop.,"Okay. I'm sure everyone in the previous comments have spoken enough. I'll just add some more info.I can see Kidz Bop 10 now.TRACK LISTINGS!1. Ohio Is For Lovers - Hawthorne Heights (""Cut my wrist and black my eyes"") I mean, c'mon, they sing about the triple x, this is only expected next.2. Heretic Anthem - Slipknot. I wouldn't really care if they ruined Slipknot. Slipknot stinks anyhow.You know. ""KIDZ BOP - EM0!!!!111onwshift!11""Ah. You all get my point.When I have kids, they're gonna listen to the Ramones. Non-stop. 24/7."
1,HORRIBLE!,"Why is it that America must ruin songs by putting them in a Kids format? I'm sorry, but that's just a bad idea to start with. Buy the original songs, in an edited format if you want to listen to them."
1,What A waste,"Kidz Bop 8 is a waste of money. Why are you paying over 10 dollars for kids to sing? Their taking great artist's songs like U2's and Kelly Clarkson's and making them sound not any good. If you actually LIKE kidz bop, go ahead and buy this CD. But you SHOULD by the REAL songs buy the REAL artists. They sound much better."
1,Awful,"I have never heard of Kidz Bop, but I was reading ""Eggplant""'s reviews(they are really entertaining) and I heard about all the Kidz Bop cd's from there. When I heard Boulvard of Brokewn Dreams was on there, I really wanted to hear it, since that is one of my favorite songs. So, I listened to the samples above and I don't believe it! All screaming kids! It killed my ears! These songs weren't meant for little kids! I wonder how they blocked out the swear in Boulvard of Broken Dreams, too! I also can't believe Vertigo! My mom has been a U2 fan since the were teenagers, and she hasn't heard this song but she would die if she did! Wonderful songs, butchered by kids screaming, its awful!"
1,what the heck?,"the vocals are bad and most of them don't sing together. And in kidz bop 9 they completly ruined wake me up when september ends. it's very sad to me because that was a song that billie joe armstrong wrote because his father died in september and i find it very disrespectfull, i think they should discontinue this crap! i don't see why anyone would listen to these ear peircing shreiks. and to mention they ruined this is halloween from ""nightmare before christmas"" it's bad, real bad."
1,How do they block out the f word in boulevard of broken dreams?,"no, really. how? or do they actually say it? curious. oh well. these songs are the worst spoofs ever! the lyrics are exactly the same! these songs don't deserve to be insulted! why couldn't they sing the teletubbies theme? this sucks."
1,Ugh....,"Whats the point of redoing songs that everyone already hates more than ever. Hell, this makes the songs performed by the real artists 1.5% better.The KB Crew is working with todays 2-bit MTV artists to bring the next generation down and turn them into hacks, except these people are peers to the kids of today.Whatever, as long as these [guys] try recreating [bad] songs by [low] artists(like MTV, VH1, or mainstream, radiorock crap basically) and come nowhere close to good music like Metal and all of its infinite subgenres then i am ok."
1,Awful,"Everything that is wrong with this CD come be sumed up by one song, Vertigo. A good U2 song is taken and ruined. The kids pre pubecent voices are hardly heard on the song, leaving an adult to sing most of it. The song is plain awfuul, your ears will be bleeding. Also the collection of songs are not the best suiting for the tween group. If parents want to buy their kids a CD, stick to The Best of Disney. Real wholesome fun there."
1,No More!!!,"Kids Bop now has eight albums can I ask how long this is going to go on? I'm sick of Kids Bop. I don't understand how people can listen to this. Even kids don't like this stuff. I know so many people who hate this stuff. The kids can't sing they are all out of tune cant get the notes or anything. Its sad but the truth. My brother who is seven laughs and makes fun of the commercial everytime it comes on. I'd love to work for Kids Bop because I love singing. But this is not what I call ""music""."
1,"Review - Kidz Bop, Vol. 8","I can't understand how this CD made it into the top 100 best sellers on Amazon. This album is so POOR I wouldn't even want to download the songs illegaly. The kids sound like they have NO vocal experience and really butcher the song. I rather listen to the orginal version of songs I hate in the album than these. Don't waste your money, and don't get 10 minutes closer to death listening to the samples.Justin, 15."
1,*****KIDZ BOP 8*****,"I can't take it anymore! THESE KIDS ARE TERRIBLE SINGERS! WHAT THE HECK?! I BET I CAN PREDICT THE NEXT CD TRACK LISTING!1. Trapped In The Closet- Part 1 of 52. Candy Shop3.

THEY LOOOOOVE TO REMAKE GREAT SONGS LIKE TAKE ME OUT, VERTIGO, AND TRUE. THEY MAKE THEM COMPLETE TRASH. UNLESS THEY'RE HILLARY DUFF SONGS, HER SONGS ARE A 10 ON THE SUCK- O- METER!"
1,HELP ME STOP THIS SEIRIES FROM COMING OUT,I WROTE A REVEIW ON KIDS BOP 7 . IT IS SO SAD THAT KIDS BOP TAKES SONGS AND LITTERALLY BREAKS THEM INTO PEICES.I LOVE GWEN STEFANI AND ALL I HEAR IS PEOPLE ON KIDS BOP THINKING THEIR GOING TO BE HER. WHAT SICK VOICES.IF YOU THINK THIS SEIRIES SHOULD STOP THEN PLEASE SAY MY REVEIW IS HELPFUL.
1,IS THIS REALLY MUSIC???,Why bother buying this awful pile of trashITS JUST POORLY RE-RECORDED VERSIONS OF ALL READY LAME SONGSYet with a lameo phoney hip-hop beat. The whole cd sounds like it was made on a 1 doller kiddie keyboard some one bought from 99 cent store
1,Do NOT Change a Good Thing,"I disagree with some of the other reviewers. These songs are good, deep songs that teenagers have the right to listen to. They appreciate these songs and enjoy them. However, children do not need to be listening to these songs which have meanings that they will not be able to comprehend. It's idiotic, what KIDZ BOP has done. The kids cannot sing these songs that were meant for more mature voices. I wouldn't recommend buying this CD if you enjoy good music."
1,When will it ever end?,"How many Kidz Bop CDs are they going to make? I don't see how they stay in business, these CDs are so terrible. I really like the songs Since U Been Gone, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and Nobody's Home, and they are all totally ruined! Kidz Bop's lead singers have weak voices and the kids' voices are completely off pitch and whiny! There is just no comparison between Kelly Clarkson, Green Day, or Avril Lavigne and Kidz Bop. In addition to that, the songs are not appropriate for little kids. I mean, a six-year-old would not understand a song like Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and the chances of them comprehending a song like Nobody's Home are slim. Kidz Bop needs to go out of business. No matter what you do, DO NOT BUY THIS CD!"
3,Shocked...Just a little warning for parents,"OK, I admit that I like Kidz Bop. I only have two rules for listening:-No Avril Lavigne songs, I can only listen to the originals-Nothing that I really hate by the original artistsSo I logged on to listen to some 8 samples, see if they were any good, and I liked what I heard(Nobody's Home the exception, Avril's is definitley better), but then I got a TREMENDOUS shock when I clicked on ""I Don't Want To Be"" and heard the F-word! And no, I didn't mishear. Just a warning:If you are a parent, and are buying this for your 7-year-old, listen to the songs first. Never assume that they are clean. If you don't like what you hear, buy something else, like Jump 5.P.S. This goes for all the Kidz Bop CDs."
3,You people need to get a reaity check,"Ok, I am the first to admit that these songs are shells of their former selves. But to actually buy any kids bop CD and expect the songs to sound like the originals is insane. These are CD's made for KIDS (hence the name KIDS BOP) Take them for what they are, cleaned up popular songs sung by children for children. Frankly my kid loves them. I am not worried about the lyrics, because as so aptly stated by reviewers before me, there are no bad words, and any adult inuendo is lost on kids. The way I look at it, is its better than listening to the real thing, talk about inappropiate. Please stop taking things so seriously, and see this for what it is. crappy music that kids love, that is not corrupt. You cant force grade schoolers to endure Barney till their 13, can you?"
1,not a good album,This is a very stupid album. Trust me I am a #1 fan of HILARY DUFF. She is way better than STUPID KIDZ BOP. Trust me parents get HILARY DUFF for your under 15 children.This is talia persad signing off. Please trust me PARENTS & KIDS UNDER 15

4,The Audial Essence of Pure Black Evil,"The title says it all, for those who know Latin. This is absolutely wild. Thouroughly enjoyable journey into horror itself. Abruptum takes an untrendy, ear, with an aquired taste to the band. the older stuff was better it had more guitars and was more frightening. Still this is a treat for the insane, I recommend it if you can handle it"
4,Interestingly Dark,"I'd heard quite a bit about Abruptum over the last decade, and I decided to give it a try. I knew what to expect from my other Black Metal friends. It's true that it's not music, but you would swear in quite a few places (when the drums start pounding and the guitar starts making noise) that they want to launch into a tune. This is great for any Halloween party."
2,A Laughable and Terrible Version of Hamlet,"Gibson presents a laughably bad and overacted version of Shakespeare's immortal character Hamlet. He is very ill-suited for the role. So too is Ophelia: supposed to be a frail girl, she is instead graying in hair and a bit too strong-willed for the role. Overall, a very bad portrayal of Hamlet. Kenneth Branagh's or Laurence Olivier's versions are considerably better."
2,Mel Gibson was not right for the role.,"Mel Gibson is not a good enough actor to play the extremely complicated Hamlet. He tries his best, but his performance looks over-the-top and forced. This movie also suffers from cutting the play almost in half and not developing the character right. I couldn't understand Ophelia's problem because she was so badly developed. Plus the castle the movie is set in is VERY ugly.The movie is difficult to watch because the castle is so ugly. Although it has many faults, the ghost scene is good and done in the correct way."
4,In It's own way,"My son purchased this film to help him write a paper on Hamlet (he got a B). Let's face it, Mel Gibson is no Shakesperean actor, but for the neophyte the film gets the story across. Glenn Close is always excellent in any role and the other actors hold up their parts well. I would recommend this film to someone who wants to learn the story but is not interested in true dialog of the period. Not one of Mel Gibson's finer performances."
5,I saw it at least 30 times!,"This movie is the greatest Hamlet version on screen, even thou it is really a short-cut from it's original Shakespare version. Zeffirelli is just a genious beyond... Ophelia's character is presented unlike any other Hamlet screen version- It's amazing. I'm shure I can view it 30 more times!"
1,Horrible!!,"If I had a zero star choice, that's what I'd choose. This does not mean I don't love Shakespeare, I saw a way-off-broadway student production and they were absolutely great. ""Suit the action to the word, the word to the action"" is Hamlet's own words to the player, and he should have been there to coach Mel Gibson and Co. Every show of aggression in the film came as a shock- not a surprise. Very unsettling when you feel whatever emotion there is should not amount to this. The whole effect was very artificial, and that includes the acting, the filming, and the cast. The only saving feature was the set and costume, and they don't do nearly enough saving."
3,"EH, IT IS SO-SO","IT IS OKAY, BUT NOT SO WONDERFUL. DOESN'T AHERE FULLY TO THE TRAGEDY. I FELT IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE MUCH BETTER; THERE ARE BETTER VERSIONS OUT THERE. THIS WAS BY NO MEANS THE WORST THOUGH, BY FAR!"
3,Hamlet,"The product itself, when I received it was in very good shape, no scratches on the disk and great picture and sound. I just am not that fond of the movie, great acting but not what I was expecting."
4,What a show!,"While this version of Hamlet tends to skimp on the actual text, Mel Gibson puts on a great show here. The standout performance for me is Glenn Close's performance as Gertrude, Hamlet's mother. What this version of Hamlet has that I feel is lacking from some of the other film versions is the setting--the remoteness and authenticity of the castle sets the scene perfectly for the mood of the film. But STUDENTS, BE WARNED: if you're trying to skip out on reading the play for class and are planning on watching the movie instead, THIS IS NOT THE VERSION TO DO SO."
5,"Nay, I know not seems - it IS exceptional!","I recently got a Kindle Fire and had to put this on it!I *hate* watching Shakespeare because it is always so labored and clumsy.Not so with Mel. I truly enjoy reading the Bard's works,but this is the only rendition I have ever seen that shows what I feel as I read.I suspect Bill would have directed it no differently!"
5,Accessible and triumphant,"The triumph of Zefferelli's Hamlet is in his brilliant use of the hidden and the known talent of Mel Gibson. Gibson conveys a modern meaning and pace to the play without, sacrificing the purity or ambiguity of its lines. As such, this video is essential to the teacher of the play- for without it, too many will miss one of the greatest achievements in art. If we are to keep Shakespeare alive, we must lure the uninitiated, young and old from their cables and video games. Mel Gibson is 'safe' and popular enough to break some of the initial resistance. That he also happens to do a remarkable, if unconventional job of it all, is why this will be a standard for many years. I was assisting a student who said to me, ""This, (meaning Shakespeare's prose,) is supposed to be the best writing ever?"" Then she watched the movie- asked questions and returned to the prose, soliloquy by soliloquy and was, I believe, transported from the MTV land to the sublime. That's a sweet prince."
2,"I enjoyed watching the movie,I can't wait to see it again.","The differences b/t the movie and the play was that, the movie was easier to understand, even though it left alot out. I would even consider watching it again. The only thing I still don't understand it why they used that type stuff for posion, and why Ophelia died without telling Hamlet her true feelings toward him so he would stay there with her."
3,A good story but boring movie.,"Over all the movie wan't that bad. They left out some of the parts that were in the play, like the part were someone jumped into the grave. They also left out the clowns conversation while they were digging the grave. This is a pretty good story, but the film was a little boring."
3,This was a wonderful movie!,This movie was excellent! It helped me to better understand the story of Hamlet and the tragic things he went through with his father's death and his mother's quick marriage with his uncle.I couldn't imagine having to go through all that at one time. I think anyone in this situation would act the same way.I think it was sad how Ophelia died and how she never knew how much Hamlet loved her. I really wished this movie would have ended a different way though. One thing that they didn't put in the movie that I thought they should have was the clowns conversation about Ophelia's burial. I thought that was interesting.
5,Fast shipping,"This was purchased for school, since I was sick the day they viewed it. I ordered and received this product in excellent condition and in less than 24 hours."
5,Riveting,"This was my first Hamlet experience, other than reading the book which I did concurrently. The lighting was magnificant, Mel Gibson's performance was of academy award caliber. It was not boring and moved along briskly, as to keep your interest. The production and directing was beautiful. I loved it. It had emotional content so long as you have feelings. A complete and perfect tragic potrayal of Shakespeare"
3,"A good story, not a bod movie.","The story had more details than the film, but the film wasn't that bad. I thought it was pretty interesting. The two parts I noticed that were left out were the clown's conversation and someone jumping into the grave. I also think the music was better on the film."
5,Hamlet,"Mel Gibson won me over. Hamlet was produced by Franco Zeffirelli, the guy behind Romeo and Juliet 22 years earlier. Great color, grays and browns from the Middle Ages. Shakespeare biographies are sketchy. William Shakespeare was born at Stratford-on-the-Avon in 1564. Stratford is 100 miles from London. Avon is the river. He married Anne Hathaway and had three children. He moved to London and established himself as a playwright. His plays were staged at the Globe. Hamlet is the best, written in 1601. It deals with revenge, procrastination and insanity. Hamlet puts on an ""antic disposition"" as he delays avenging his father's murder. The real issue is death. Why do we have to die? Why live at all if we must die? Shakespeare died in 1616 at age 52. His 36 plays divide into tragedies, comedies, histories and problem plays. Characters drop like flies in the tragedies."
5,"YEA, MEL","This is the first time I ever like Mel Gibson. There are many great folks in this, of course. This isn't my favorite version. Kenneth Branagh's takes first place, for me. This is still very good. I like to see all ideas of Shakespeare. Worth the time to watch."
5,Shakespeare on film,"Excellent film for classroom use to accompany the play. It is only half of Shakespeare's drama, but it gives students a chance to grasp the plot and mood that the writer so masterfully pens."
3,Hamlet,Mel Gibson as Hamlet? I wouldn't have believed it till I saw the movie! But what I really liked about the movie was Glenn Close!
1,Mel Miscast as Hamlet; Mediocre Production,"Mel Gibson has built a successful film career as an action hero, so, what an odd, awkward choice he was to play tortured Hamlet. Dying his hair blonde another silly miscue. And having Glenn Close (who is about 5 yrs older than Mel) playing his Mom, sheer goofiness. Production values and overall feel is rather crude, totally unlike Kenneth Branagh's magnificent 1996 version of Hamlet. Selectively chopping away at the play's script did not help this awkward version either."
2,Disappointing,"Mel Gibson is always good to look upon; however, this version of Hamlet was not handled well by the director and so the whole production was disappointing."
3,"Interesting, good cast, but..","The story is kept to the essentials, and the supporting cast is very good. It's better than I had thought it would be, nice and crisp.Sadly, Mel Gibson was a disappointment to me. He did give some force to the character that many others have lacked, but I kept feeling that large chunks of his interpretation and his delivery had been perhaps overly influenced by the 1964 Richard Burton performance, not a very well-known version today because it exists only as a fairly rough filming of the stage play. However, the Burton version is available on DVD, and I recommend it not only for the excellence of the performances but also for an interesting comparison with the Mel Gibson interpretation."
4,True to the story,"I had to watch a version of Hamlet for a history class, and this version is VERY true to the play. It wasn't too boring either, and Gibson does a good job of capturing Hamlet's madness!"
2,Gibson Great... Zeffirelli Not so Much,"Gibson brings a wonderful dynamic to the role... but the rest of the film's direction by Zeffirelli is a travesty. The Freudian Oedipus complex? ... oh, please... done to death. The complete removal of the opening scene of the play (the ghost appears to the guards)? Well, that just about stops any forward momentum the play is meant to have at its start. And the almost complete removal of the Fortinbras subplot? Uh, that pretty much guts the parallel structure of the play.Stick to the Branagh version instead!"
5,THE BEST HAMLET EVER!,This is by far the best Hamlet ever done. Mel Gibson and the rest of the cast are superb. The other versions of hamlet are a waste of your time.Wacth this for a true masterpeice.
3,I feel ill,"Hamlet lying on top of his mom, giving her a steamy kiss. I've gone all through my book, and I can't find that happening anywhere in it. It is possibly the most disturbing image I have ever seen. The acting wasn't horrible (except for Ian Holm's - and I so liked him in ""King Lear,"" too.) Ah, well. Franco makes his actors wear odd costumes which are supposed to add to the authenticity of the production but are actually just distracting. And he shuffles and removes key lines, and even scenes. Not the worst filming of a Shakespeare tragedy I have seen, but most certainly not the best."
1,"Gorblimey, it's 'orrible!","Somebody should be assigned to guard Franco Zefirrelli. That's right, guard him. Whenever Zefirrelli says, ""Hey, I'm gonna make a movie out of Shakespeare!"", he should be slapped in the head. Repeatedly. Maybe that'll dissuade him. From his ridiculous ROMEO AND JULIET to his terrible TAMING OF THE SHREW, and now with this nightmare, Zefirrelli's plan has been simple and threefold.A) Hire the worst actors you can find. The Ophelia in this production is good, and the Polonius isn't bad, but the rest of them should not be allowed anywhere near Shakespeare.B) Simplify. Cut out the heart of the story. Pare to the bare bones and then pare some more. If a nuance remains, keep choppin'.C) Make it ludicrous. What do you want? Hamlet chopping about with his sword in 1.5? Threatening Rosencrantz and Guildenstern? Falling in love with his mother, perhaps? It's all here.Avoid at all costs."
4,Look at this! Mel Gibson in a willy script...,"He did great! That fun lover drunkard Jew hating man! I expect much more from him in the future...HA! How many Years has it been since I've seen him in anything?! His past works where wonderful, pity for his future."
1,Dreadful,"This film has many problems, bad cuts, miscasting, etc. - but I'll limit myself to Mel Gibson here. This is the most ridiculous Hamlet I've ever seen. Mel plays him with swaggering machismo (the only thing he is capable of) and it is wrong, wrong, wrong. Hamlet is a passive-aggressive type; he is indirect in everything he does. Laurence Olivier's is a good example as to how he should be played. Gibson's doesn't even make any sense.And as far as the cuts, they're particularly bad here, but everyone does it. Olivier cuts quite a bit out of it himself."
2,Shakespeare Would Have Died,"Casting Mel Gibson as the complicated Hamlet was a huge mistake. I felt as if he didn't even understand the words coming out of his mouth. Also, the long play was cut in half, leaving a lot missing. Glenn Close was way too young to be cast as Mel's mother; she's not even 10 years older than him, and Zefferelli didn't even bother to put ageing makeup on her. I think Glenn Close is a fine actress, but she only did a mediocre job in this mediocre movie. The messy and grainy cinematography never let me forget that I was watching a movie, instead of sucking me into the story. The Kenneth Branagh version is infinitely better."
3,Good effort but...,"This is a Hamlet in which you need to find the grain among the straw: Zeffirelli shows as usual stick to realistic art direction and a master directing actors (as he probed many times both on stage and in front of camera) but such precision can leave you with the need for something daring, provocative, new... and it is not.Paul Scofield's Ghost and Glenn Close's Queen Gertrude are the best among a cast of talented actors. Mel Gibson for the main role was since the beginning the more controversial choice, and no matter what he is not suitable for prince Hamlet.But at the end, it was always common with Zeffirelli making this kind of ""moves"", like casting Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton for ""Taming of the Shrew"" or the multicast of ""Jesus of Nazareth""."
3,Quick Fix fo novice Shakespearians,"This was a beautiful recreation of one of Shakespeare's greatest works. The studios spared no cost in the design of the costume. It left one's view towards the aesthetics of the era within the Denmark's noble circle. This is an excellent piece of work for anyone interested in a quick fix of Shakespeare. Unfortunately, it was rather chopped up from the original play written in 1601. The film briefly covered each scene of the play -- lasting a mere 135 min. In all actuality it should have lasted over 200 min. The cast of characters was selected well for their roles. Mel Gibson has always played an interesting mad man, which was required for this roll. This is a must see film for any Gibson fans or novice Shakespearians, but not for the student who is truly interested in the aesthetics of this great play. Find the original uncut version for the overall experience."
4,This was a great film the acting was good and very pleasing,I liked the movie and I thought it was very understandable unlike the play which was a bit harder to understand. The acting in the play was good and so was the action. But I found that some parts in the film were left out like the scene in the play were the clowns had a scene. Over all this is a great film.
3,Good acting yet long pointless story line.,"I rated the movie as a three because the acting was great, but it wasn't a very good story. Mel Gibson did a great job depicting the grief and anxiety Hamlet felt. Nevertheless, the story was very long and over emphasized."
2,Highlights of Hamlet,"When I first saw this version, not long after its release I was immediately lost and confused. Having a clear ability to understand Shakespeare (as I had read several of his plays, but not yet Hamlet) I was bewildered. A film based on Shakespeare needs to interpret the work VISUALLY as well as with the dialogue.This is not a film for those who know not the play and it is too short, too cut and too uninspired for those who do. What a pointless mess, really. Typical dreary castle, typical silly costumes, typical, typical, typical. It's everything people expect from films based on Shakespeare, boring, dull, familiar.See Kenneth Branaughs 4hr masterpiece, and Anthony Hopkins ""Titus"" or Ian McKellen's ""Richard III"" to see what Shakespeare can really be on screen."
3,The play's the thing....,"....and the way Hamlet is played by Gibson in this film is what sets it apart positively even in comparison to Branagh's bacalava-rich version. Gibson plays Hamlet with such endearing vigor and projects a sense of hopeful intelligence rather than the usual ""sighing and indecisive"" Dane. Gibson's Hamlet intends to win at his game, and he makes us believe, even though we know the story inside out, that he might just do it! I enjoy this interpretation very much, and it makes the severe cutting of the script (as opposed to Branagh's ponderous version) even acceptable. Glenn Close is a wonderful Gertrude and Helena Bonham-Carter (who I believe was Branagh's girlfriend at the time of this film), did the part much better than Winslet. I rated this film and the Branagh version both the same--for absolutely different strengths and weaknesses. Both films are fair adaptations, neither is perfect...as if there was any such thing as the perfect adaptation of Hamlet."
1,"Hamlet, Mel Gibson","Wrong region, region 1, so I can't watch it on my DVD-player. Useless for us in Sweden. Didn't get any any information about this when I bought it- disappointed!"
4,Great Introduction,"While Mel Gibson may not be the perfect Hamlet, he brings a great deal of humanity to the role. And while supposed ""purists"" would say this is rubble, I instead find it an excellent retelling of the classic tale, and a great way to introduce people to the works of Shakespeare."
3,Outdated calendar,"If you want an up to date calendar, this isn't for you. It is almost two years out of date. But the pictures are great and that is what the sellers are counting on."
3,Ummm...,"Well, this is basically Vampyre Throne of the Beast (previous Black Funeral opus) recorded on a very very poor production! I wouldn't label this ""Raw"" black metal, the production is just too poor! The bonus tracks are pretty killer, though. The vocals do have a very ghastly sound to them, they sound nothing like their previous album. For those of u that are skeptical about this release, just pick up Vampyre Throne of The Beast! The production on that is much better, yet raw & every instrument can be heard clearly!"
1,Have potential if they just leave the bathroom,The most disappointing thing about this CD is the sound quality. It sounds as if it was recorded in a bathroom. Combine that with the vocals and you have incomprehensible music. Don't get me wrong they still have a good sound but the lyrics need to be clearer and the recording studio needs improvement.
1,i just don't get it......,"i bought this on an online auction thinking i might be getting some brutal black metal. man was i ever wrong. compared to Black Funeral, those raw Darkthrone albums are 'heavy.' this just is not for me, it is horrible prodcution on purpose i know but the instruments sound like toys. and i cannot take this noisey low fi stuff seriously, its just crap. those raw Darkthrone albums suck hamsters too, but not as bad as this lame joke.i want to get rid of this piece of junk but don't have anyone to give it too."
5,The Big Show / Pierre Clostermann,"This is one of the most memorable read that I have. No, I do not still have the reprint, but I do have my old yellowed Ballantine copy from the 70s. This is one of those books that are told in such a way that you have difficulty putting it down, even now, I still occasionally go back to read parts of it. Only yesterday, I went back to this book to read a small excerpt from Antoine de St. Exupery's ""Pilotte de Guerre"". As I was looking into the discovery of St. Exupery's P38 Lightning, finally found off Marseille just this year. Pierre Clostermann is as gifted a writer, as he is a fighter pilot. Anyway, now, to see if I can finally get myself a hardbound copy of The Big Show to last for the next 40 years.."
1,Movie Skips,The DVD pauses and skips a little even though the description when I bought the item said it was in new condition. I love this movie I just wish I could watch it through completely.
4,"A GOOD, SOLID PIECE OF CINEMA","I was surprised about how likable this charming and funny movie was! I enjoy Julia Robert's films, she really is appealing to the audience, especially here. Julia plays a woman named Maggie who has a---wedding-phobia. She leaves her loves at the alter. When a reporter (Richard Gere) trys to get the scoop on her crazy story, he slowly falls in love with her, but will she leave him hanging at their big wedding? Enjoyable romp that should please fans of Roberts and Gere's earlier movie hit, ""Pretty Woman"". Check it out!"
1,"Marshall, Roberts and Gere waited 10 Years for This?!!","I like both Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. ""Pretty Woman"" is one of my favorite movies. Contrary to many a popular opinion, I actually think Julia Roberts is a pretty good actress. All this said, I HATED this movie! It was a trite screenplay and a poorly acted film. Not only did I not laugh once, some of the scenes made me angry they were so bad. The stupid ""nods"" to ""Pretty Woman"" (ie: Richard Gere struggling to crack the crab a la Julia Roberts and the escargot) were cheap and stupid. Don't waste your money or your time on this thoroughly disappointing and altogether patronizing movie."
4,"The older he gets, the better he looks.","I just finished reading several of the reviews for this movie and most the complaints seemed to be because this wasn't ""Pretty Woman"".Thank God!The only thing they have in common is the stars, Gere and Roberts. I watch enough movies that I don't feel the need to compare, but try to watch them on their own merits (if indeed they even have any).I like this one, obviously. The acting was absolutely surperb, the storyline interesting, and the magic always there. Occasionally, a great happy ending is wonderful and this was pretty much a great ending for everyone, even the jilted 4th husband to be.On a purely superficial note, Roberts doesn't seem to give a damn how she looks and I like that, too. At times she looked bloody awful, others drop-dead gorgeous. Gere, on the other hand, just keeps getting better and better looks-wise. I liked the combination of the two, the chemistry, and their on screen reactions to one another.Well worth seeing and owning."
4,More realistic than Pretty Woman or Notting Hill!,"I am not so much into romance/comedy type of movies but I like Julia Roberts & Richard Gere, especially in their previous team-up Pretty Woman, so I decided to watch Runaway Bride.Though the plot was predictable with Julia/Maggie dumping her latest fiance, I did not expect that she would also run away from Richard/Ike. Their making up & reuniting at the end was so 'down-to-earth'& real; & all of us can relate to that. No fancy thoughts, no fairy tale, no ""& they lived happily ever after"" kind of stuff. Here you will see what life really is. People struggle with their own fears & try to move on, still a continuous struggle towards a better life.That proposal by Maggie to Ike was the most unromantic thing I ever heard...BUT IT MADE ME CRY!!!!!!"
1,This movie is bad,I was really looking forward to seeing these two together again and I was so disappointed. The movie tried so hard to be funny. I wanted to turn it off midway through. What is so cute about these poor men being left at the alter and what is her reason? The worse part is the men she left behind still liked her.
3,funny:),"it's not terrably ""deep"", though it did have a nice point to it. i laughed a lot, though and i think you will too."
1,TEN STEPS BELOW ZERO! A REAL BOMB!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere should have given every cent they received on this movie for charity! Horrible acting and plot. Julia and Richard, I hope you get to read this one day."
1,Very Bland,"All The Chemistry in the World Doesn't make a Great,Good,or even Average Film.those words plus Fair don't even Describe this Awful Film.Roberts,Gere&Marshall are just Cashing in the Check on this Forgettable Mess.Nothing Fresh or Original here."
1,It should be illegal to release a movie this bad.,"OK, where do I start. This is a terrible movie. There is no good part and I'm sick of seeing that annoying woman run from the altar. I would give this movie 0 stars, but I can't. DON'T BUY THIS! DON'T RENT THIS. Extremely hazardous to your health. May all copies of this movie be burned at that stake."
2,Hugely disappointed!,"2 stars because these ARE two of my favorite stars on film. I did enjoy Pretty Woman and was looking forward to seeing them together again. Maybe because my expectations were so high that the disappointment is so incredible. Pleaseeee, this movie felt like it was made up as they went along. Okay now we'll put in a couple of guys singing, now we'll show the horses again, now we'll have them playing cards, now... It was like instead of having a story to be told they started with just wanting to get these two actors together once again on the screen. A 2 hour long sitcom. And because I couldn't believe what I was seeing I guess I plumb missed all the jokes everyone else is talking about. Maybe they can try again in a couple of years."
2,So so movie,"Just not that great a movie. Pretty Woman has much better acting and better story.But if you really want to see these two actors again, its not a BAD movie.Good music."
1,Horrible!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's advertised as being a ""follow-up"" to Pretty Woman? I don't think so! This movie is nowhere near as good as Pretty Woman! The script is weak, it's completley miscast...I could go on! Don't waste your time or money on this one!"
1,Unbearably Stupid!,"Richard Gere plays a newspaper reporter who ahs been sacked because he can't write, er, good articles. When Richy hears about a Runaway Bride named Maggie Carpenter who likes to dump grooms ride at the altar, he decides it is the perfect story to win back his job. So, he immediately goes down to Maggie's home town. She is currently engaged, and he is not leaving until she runs from that chapel again! However, when our Richy falls for Maggie, things get more and more complicated. Is he still in love with his job? Or is going to go for Maggie instead?Runaway Bride has a perfectly good idea, but the script is poor and weak. The direction from Mr. Marshall is not near as good as the effort he put into Pretty Woman. The leading actors have good names, but unfortunately their performances aren't good enough to give this film an extra star.Do not waste your time on this unbearably stupid trash!"
3,Not a guy movie but...,"I have to start off by saying I don't like Julia Roberts or Richard Gere. I had no intention of seeing this but my girlfriend wanted to. To my amazement, I didn't hate it. It's definitely a ""chick-flick"" but Gere's character made the movie entertaining. Maybe three stars is a bit generous for this movie but it's one of those where the woman will be happy and the guy, well, entertained."
2,No magic this time around.,"Runaway Bride starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts is their second time teaming up and Garry Marshall directed them in Pretty Woman. I didn't like this film at all, it's considered a romantic comedy but it feels more like a drama, Roberts' character has major commitment issues and it takes 2 hours to figure out why she won't get married, that could have been resolved much quicker! The chemistry between the two actors is not as strong or connvincing like Pretty Woman. Joan Cusack also stars and of course she steals every scene. Runaway Bride had me running from ever watching this fluff again!"
5,It's about time,I loved this movie and it is way past due for these two to be together again! Their chemistry is incomparable! Waiting for the next movie!
4,excellent!,"excellent film and great dvd! the only thing is that i wish there would have been more extra features on the dvd. having the dixie chicks video is ok,but having a ""making of"" featurette would have been even better. still in all,this is one of 1999's best movies and anyone wondering whether or not you should get the dvd: my advice is to get it!"
1,For those who don't feel like thinking.,"This is quite easily one of the worst and most predictable movies ever! I nearly ripped the disc out of my DVD during the scene at her walk-thru rehearsal at the church where she is waiting at the altar for her fiance and Gere steps in instead...ugh! Come on! This is for those who have absolutely nothing better to do. Rent it, if you must, but don't buy it. Seeing once was torture enough!"
2,Not for me,It was my stepdaughter's choice. She needs a real perspecitve on life. This kind of movie gives her the wrong ideas about life.
4,"Not Pretty Woman, but....","I enjoyed this movie. I loved Pretty Woman and I think this is a close second to that movie. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere have great chemistry still and it is a funny story. I find this a great ""go-to"" movie when I am sad and need a good laugh. And the soundtrack is really good. I couldn't believe when I realized I LOVED a Miles Davis song!!!"
4,Entertaining movie,I really like this movie and I think Julia Roberts and Richard Gere make a great couple on screen. I wanted to have movie in dvd and add it to my collection.
2,Really stilted,"I usually enjoy both Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, but this movie just did not do it for me...perhaps because it was somewhat dated (which I knew going into it), or perhaps because this earlier work just featured actors not quite yet at their prime. The pacing was just slow and it lost my interest about half-way through."
4,Ear to Ear Smiles from Intro to Ending.,"Utterly Enjoyable in every department, anyone who critisises this film is taking it and themselves far too seriously, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts have Chemistry to Burn in this film, at some points it's like there just having a great time and have forgotten that the Cameras rolling. Julia is as Loveable as ever and Richard plays his most likeable character in decades. (though, how hard is it to act like your in love with Julia, i act like that every day)The Supporting Cast are Hillarious, (Joan Cusack and Hector Elizondo are standouts) the pacing, screenplay and Direction are spot-on, a sure-fire crowd pleaser."
5,Runaway Smash Hit!,Brilliant work from Julia Roberts and Richard Gear. It's about time you guys got together again to film this movie. The movie flows very well from one scene to the next. The scenes are hilarious. It's not very often you get a movie with good clean fun anymore. I highly recommend you watch this movie to the very end!
4,Almost perfect,Remove the cuss words and some of the crassness and it is a five. Still watchable and far better than most recent things.
5,Julia Roberts and Richard Gere perfect match in Runaway Bride,"I have probably watched this every year since it came out. It is funny, touching, and makes you care about the characters. The on camera chemistry between the stars is a perfect match. It is a must own movie for you collection."
5,Julia + Richard = Classic,"Seriously, this movie is one of my favorites. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere have an on-screen chemistry that combines with an engaging plot and endearing cast for an instant classic. If you haven't seen it, just do it. Do it now. Plus, Richard Gere is gorgeous... you can't go wrong."
2,"Julia, Get Another Personality....","Enough already of the sarcastic pretty woman of a decade ago, can't she grow up and display just a bit of class & diversity now & then! This has to be the emptiest plot around & all just to reunite the 3 stars & director from her first big role. Who would believe any of these characters or the situation of a multi-weddinged babe & the small-town feeling is just as contrived. And a society columnist in the main-news section of USA Today? It might be fun for a few light laughs but I feel basically we should just forget this one!!"
3,Not quite the dreck of Pretty Woman,"I like romantic comedies, but I truly, truly, truly hated Pretty Woman. To me, Runaway Bride seems to have a terrible pedigree, which it seems to have largely overcome.Fortunately, this film is reasonably well-paced and slickly written. It suffers a bit from predictability, cliche moments, improbability (I have never met anyone who reads the USA Today editorial page, let alone memorize the face of any of their writers), and overobvious product placement.The presence of serveral capable secondary performers (Hector Elizondo, Joan Cusack, Laurie Metcalf) helps when the Julia and Richard show flags from time to time. The flight scenes, though, are beautiful. The bride, trying desperately to escape her fate, madly dashing through the church . . ."
3,ok,This is a funny movie. And it is somewhat of a romantic comedy. If you like the movie pretty womman then you will like this movie.
3,Runaway Bride,"This film reunited Julia Roberts and Richard Gere in a film that is more of a miss than a hit. The plot isn't that well developed feeling contrived and boring at times. The music is the only bright spot, and it is a must have. The chemistry that Roberts and Gere are so well known for is sadly missing. They looked like they weren't even having fun making it. Even the superb supporting cast cannot save this film."
2,pretty empty,"that's the best thing you can say; very cute, and just fine if you liked Pretty Woman; Richard Gere is very charming and sometimes funny, and Julia is Julia; there's cameoes by Larry Miller and Hector Elizando (!); check out the soundtrack, featuring Shawn Colvin and the Dixie Chicks - it's not bad"
1,More Trashy Roberts,"Paramount should have been shut down for making a film that glorifies a woman with total disrespect for her fiance(s), men in general, and everyone else in her life. Roberts is her usual strange self and should be sent the bill for all the resources wasted finding Jennifer Wilbanks after she decided it would be cool to imitate this braindead movie."
2,"JULIA, TRY TO STAY SINGLE.","Runaway bride is not like Pretty woman.Richard Gere is OLD, and Julia is more beautiful every time.But the movie, is boring and a not funny or romantic at all.The only good thing here is Julia, she is great and she'll always gonna be great."
1,save your money-not gere and roberts best work,"I particually love watching romantic comedy's, this was a BIG disappointment, I read that joan cusack stole moments from this movie and it was true! The plot and story lines were weak. I found myself wishing this movie just to end...I loved notting hill and thought this would be another, and it was 180 degrees the other way. gere and roberts were wonderful together once before and in this case it was enough."
2,not the best for both,this movie went a little too slow then the romance suddely really blossomed towards the end ike Notting Hill...the storyline was cute but it wasn't persuasive enough IMO. they bothe have done much much better..
2,Below Average,"This movie was a letdown. No real ""chemistry"" until about 75% of the movie is over.Skip it and see Notting Hill, which was much better."
1,Disappointed,"As a huge fan of the Roberts and Gere team, I have to say I was highly disappointed in the outcome of this movie. Original? Yes. Interesting and funny? No. Just because a movie is original, doesn't mean it's good. Although we all knew the happy ending was forthcoming, the storyline to getting there was pure boredom. Then again, it's hard to make an engaging (pardon the pun) movie with such a ridiculous story line. Pretty Woman was a far far better flick, you can't even compare the two. Then again, this is just my own personal opinion, after all, everyone is entitled to their own. Go ahead and see it if you're curious. I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading my review."
1,Dont fall for this bride,"While thinking a movie starting Julia Roberts, and Richard Gere what can be wrong, but to my surprise I found out that ""everything"" can be wrong, the bride was very un charming, and un-sexy, the acting was not to a satisfactory level, Richard was a little better in his part, but still the story didn't make much sense from the beginning, it was to long and boring..... DO NOT FALL FOR THIS ONE..."
2,Now a reality show in a town near you,"Not so funny when it happens to you, is it? Now that the public has turned on the real runaway bride, attempting to press criminal charges for her flighty behavior, we can appreciate just how unreal this movie was, and that ""Julia"" would have left lots of wreckage behind her as she bolted from each wedding. Instead, the whole tragedy is played for laughs and, ironically, press coverage. Both Gere and Julia have seen better days, and have been playing themselves in lackluster films as long as anyone can remember. Watch ""Goodbar"" instead to see the real Gere."
2,"This is no ""Pretty Woman""","Ok, so I didn't expect this to be as good as pretty woman, but I did expect it to be pretty good since Julia Roberts and Ricard Gere were in it. I didn't enjoy it much. It moved kind of slow, and the whole movie all I kept waiting for was the reason she kept running away at the altar, and without giving away the ending, I thought it was a really flaky and unsubstantial reason. I didn't really enjoy it. I didn't find it very funny, I never laughed out loud once through the whole movie. If you like romantic comedies, try the wedding singer."
3,Good if there is nothing else on.,"I like this movie, but it is not something I want to own. While it is funny to watch on tv, it is rather dull and lackluster. I like Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, but this movie offers nothing new and I don't care if you are Richard Gere, if a girl keeps running away from you, she doesn't want you."
3,A Cute Little Movie,"Well, I know that from reading a few of the other reviews that this movie did not fare well with everyone. I actually thought that this was a very cute movie which made you laugh and was a pleasant, adorable film to watch. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere were great and I enjoyed watching them.This story takes place as Ike(Richard Gere) who is a news reporter is investigating a women Maggie(Julia Roberts) who seems to be able to get engaged easily, but never quite makes it down the isle to say ""I do"". This was a romantic, sweet little movie and if that is what you are looking for, you have found it."
3,A pretty good movie-,"Julia does the same character in almost every movie, so if you like her, you will like the movie. It is sweet and romantic and of course has the ""happily ever after"" ending that the fairy tale lover is looking for. The best part of this movie was not the main characters, but the little things in the background: the references to Pretty Woman, the ""Curl up and Dye"", the supporting cast (Joan Cusack, what's not to love?)."
3,Not What I Was Hoping For,"This movie missed so many chances to be funny and have more romance. I found it hard to watch Julia for she looked very thin and tired. She has made better movies and so has Richard Gere. I think the story line could have been better for the both of them. It needed more fun and humor to be a good movie. Julia and Richard are great actors, this movie just didn't do anything for their acting abilities. Guess I was just expecting more for them to be humorous and romantic."
3,"Not quite Pretty Woman, but it works.","I have to admit I was not one of the millions of people that rushed to see ""Runaway Bride"" while it wa still in theatres. I waited until it came out on video so I wouldn't feel that I had wasted all that money on soda and popcorn to see a bomb. I was pleasantly surprised! Julia Roberts and Richard Geer do a fantastic job of creating instant on screen chemistry, and really carry this movie off. This is a terrific romantic love story, and I put it in the same class as ""When Harry Met Sally..."". If you haven't seen it, give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,Watched with my wife,"My wife forced me to watch this with her, and I was actually pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the film."
5,Good movie,I bought this movie as a gift for my friends mother who is a big fan of Julia Roberts. Great price for it!
5,GREAT,JULIA ROBERTS AND RICHARD GERE ARE THE BEST WHEN TEAMED TOGETHER IN MOVIES! WISH THERE WERE MORE THEN JUST 2!CUTE MOVIE.
3,OK A Romantic B Film.,"The idea of reuniting Julia Roberts and Richard Gere after the phenomenal success of Pretty Woman was a good idea. The fact the reunion was so spaced out, it made Gary Marshall look like he was either remaking or shooting a sequel for Pretty Woman. The film just didn't cut it for me. It lacked everything that Pretty Woman had. The humor was a more cheesy slapstick style, and the plot was too weak to compare to its predecessor. Looking at it as a movie by itself, however, it wasn't all that bad. If you loved Pretty Woman, give it a try. I sort of reccomend this."
3,Still a fun flick,"I thought this movie was fun. It was a light romantic comedy in the old fashioned sense, a good film to watch on a rainy afternoon where you want to veg. I had the priveledge of getting to see how a town is transformed to be used as the background of a movie, with this movie. It was filmed in the small town of Berlin, Maryland, which is half way between Salisbury, MD and Ocean City, MD. The kind of town people like to drop into because it looks so nice. Lots of Antique shops, and such, but it was neat to see how they painted the windows and made signs for the movie backgrounds. Person that said, makes you want to pack up and move to Vermont? Sure isn't Vermont, and I am told that the hilly scenes were just outside of Baltimore on the Western Shore of Maryland. Eastern Shore (where Berlin is, the town was changed to Hale for the movie) is flat as a pancake."
4,This is a BEAUTIFUL movie...,"It's a cute plot, great characters with absolutely BREATHTAKING autumn scenery. Of course, no one will probably ever get married at the top of a hill and ride off on horses...but you can in THIS movie. Just watch it and enjoy it."
5,movie,I love anything with these two in it. The movie was cute and sweet and funny. exactly what i was hoping for and expecting.
1,duMB MOVIE,THis movie is dumb with lame jokes and you know what the ending is from the dumb commercials. Anyone who thinks this is a good movie is out of their bird-brain. Pretty woman was so much better. Buy pretty woman instead.
1,Save your Money,"Ok, this was a horrible movie. It's another Hollywood attempt to make an easy buck and cash in on the success of an earlier and much better movie (Pretty Woman). I saw this in the theatre and could not believe that I paid money to sit through it. The movie has no direction what so ever and yet is also extremely pridictable not to mention very slow moving. The stars walk through their performances as if they even realize how bad of a script this was. If you like Julia Roberts and/or Richard Gere, buy another movie because this one is way done on the list in their canons."
1,In a word; YUCK,"This isn't just a reflex action to that romantic comdey genre, although admitddly it isn't among my favourites. But this film is badly paced, to be quite honest I was staring at the furniture in Gere's apartment during the second half of the film. Sure a romantic comedy being predictable is a given but tedious, sachyrinne, badly directed, acted and just about everything else. This thing looked like a sitcom. For those of you who claim ""Gere's best performance"", have you seen Primal Fear? Internal Afairs(Where he was better then the film) or even An Officer and A Gentleman. You rent of these popcorn films for a good lazy afternoon, and this will bore you to death. For what a romantic comedy is supposed to be, see Four Weddings and A Funeral."
1,Runaway bride,Julia please retire and let some of the more talented( and a lot prettyer) young actresses take parts like this... you so full of yourself
5,Flawless Masterpiece,This cd is amazing!!! From the production to the vocals this cd is a flawless masterpiece. She had nice beats and she didn't compromise the word of God. This is what I needed. some of your are probably scared to buy this cd because of the last cd. This time around no need to be scared because this album Is filled with uptempo songs and ballads. Not mediocre uptempo songs and ballads but Hot uptempo songs and beautiful ballads. Get This album. You will play this album For a long time to come.
5,Outstanding,This is one of the best CD's I have heard in a while. Ki Ki brung it! The production is excellent and her voice of course is anointed. There is a little something for everyone on here of all ages.
4,Bonjour Monsieur Shlomi,This was a great movie. I would watch it again. It was not over played or unreal.Not hard to follow when it comes to foriegn language.
5,Magnificent!,"I absolutely love this film and I am so glad I got the DVD. I already watched it twice. I initially got it for the language being a student of Hebrew, but I was captivated by the story and the actors who are spectacular in my view. If you want to spend an enjoyable,calming and very funny evening, watch this movie.."
4,Good Overall Background Summary,"This is a good book for someone new to the world of warhammer, but there are misspellings, and a few mistakes as to who does what. It has a good timeline which outlines what each race does throughout the history of the warhammer world. I would recommend this to anyone wondering what warhammer is about."
5,Excellent general history of the Warhammer world,"This book is a wonderful addition to any Warhammer fans library. With great illustrations on every page and a time line and ""Heroes and Villians"" section this book is very entertaining and interesting from start to finish. I loved it."
4,A GOOD READ!! A MUST BUY FOR WARHAMMER FANS!!!,"this book is a great read for anybody that is starting in warhammer, if you are a veteran player, though, you might want to subscribe to white dwarf instead. the book is informative about almost any army, the magic, the units and the history of warhammer and the grudges that the races have with each other.a must buy for warhammer fans!"
5,My Most Used Cookbook,"I've never felt compelled to write a review on Amazon, but this book is worth it. Of my massive collection of cookbooks at home, this one is by far the most used. I've made at least 20 of the recipes, and none of them has failed me. My brother in law told me that the pasta dish I made from this book tasted like ""restaurant food."" A friend from work asked me for so many recipes (mostly after peering over my lunch containers) that she finally ordered the book. My step mom and I both cook from this book frequently and report back to each other on which recipes to try next. I've recommended this book to countless people, and everyone has loved it. The recipes are incredibly fast and they all taste great. If you're going to invest in a quick cooking book, make it this one!"
3,Easy and bland,If your goal is to make something easy that's edible than this book gives you lots of choices. Most of the recipes are of the caliber of Hamburger Helper or maybe Applebees. I can understand the appeal of the book for those without much time who need to feed indiscriminate eaters. It has it's place but it's not the food I want to eat on a regular basis.
2,Not what I expected.,I was looking for something easy on the budget and quick. And there are no pictures.
1,Very Disappointed,"I was prepared to love this book (and do like some of the pantry tips) but have been disappointed with the 3 or 4 recipes I've tried. Maybe I've had the bad luck of choosing the worst recipes in the book but everything so far has been very bland. I judge a recipe by the criteria, ""would I make it again?"", unfortunately none of these passed. I'm ready to retire this book.From my notes: Two-For-One Noodles: ""a little bland""; Mock Spinach and Ricotta Lasagna: ""just OK - not outstanding""; Hamburger Steak with Mushroom: ""gravy too bland/pasty""."
4,Great for busy cooks,"My mother got me my copy of Desperation Dinners a couple years ago because while I love to cook, as a busy college student I didn't usually have the time to prepare an elaborate meal.Nearly every recipe in this book *will* be ready in 20 minutes. The exceptions are the recipes where you have to boil water; those can take up to 10 minutes more to prepare. The important thing to remember is that you have to keep moving. Of course, if you have someone helping you then things move along much faster.I have enjoyed every recipe I've made using this book. The ingredients are easy to find and prepare, and you get a variety of flavors and meal types. Plus, the recipes are easy to modify if you need to.I highly recommend this book as a starter cookbook for college students and new couples who want to do more in the kitchen but may not have the time for elaborate meals."
5,Fast and Flavorful!,Finally a cookbook that has fast recipes that really taste good! I am able to get dinner on the table in less than 45 minutes which makes cooking less of a chore.
2,Problems with mp3 and audio cd's,"I got a Mojo a short while ago. Initally I was very impressed with it's specs. How ever, I have had nothing but problems with it. I returned the first one because it wouldn't play half of the mp3's that I tried... it would just freeze. The second one I got seems better, but I still have alot of problems with it. I have numerous audio cd's that it either refused to play, or plays with lots of clicks, pops, and stuttering. In addition, I have been creating mp3's from my cd collection to archive, and I still have alot of mp3's that stutter and stall, or won't play at all. I have tried 2 ripping/encoding programs and 2 codecs with similar results both times. I also tried 2 brands of cdr and a cdrw.I for one, am very dissapointed over all and I will be returning it and trying another brand (Rio??)"
2,Does mediocre job with audio CDs,"I bought this player so I could listen to audio and MP3 CDs on the road. It does a fine job with MP3s, but it didn't like any of my homemade Audio CDs - it would quit playing after a few songs, or it would put gaps and clicks between songs that aren't there when the discs are played on other CD players. This didn't happen with just one or two of my CDs, but almost all of them."
1,Buy the Rio instead,I got this mp3 player because CNET.COM gave it a 9 rating. Boy was I suprised. The darn thing will not read any mp3 that I burned. I even tried using 3 different cd burning programs which resulted in hours of fustration. I returned it within 3 hrs of opening the darn thing. My friend has a rio sonic blue 100 whichhas no problem reading any cd's that I burned. I will get a Rio as soon as I get a refund for this player.
2,Does NOT read all MP3 CDRW types!,"Hold it! What the misleading ads, glowing reviews, etc DON'T tell you is that the Mojo can't read CDRWs formatted for packet writing. Well, my computer's CD burner uses -- guess -- PACKET WRITING!! I only find this out after I've bought the thing, got it out of the package, plug it in, and stare in awe as the LCD just displays ""can't read"" and shuts itself off every time I put in an MP3 CD... what a RIP OFF. Then I notice that the user manual informs you of this glaring flaw way in the back in fine print (which you will never see until you've bought this kludge, opened the package, etc, because the reviews tell you nothing about this.) So forget listening to any MP3 music on your CDRWs if your computer has the Adaptec Direct CD software like mine does. Oh, but it plays regular audio CDs just fine (except for the skipping)... whoopee."
1,"Horrible CD player, not worth it, stay far away.","I bought this CD player for 100 bucks, and it was the worst thing I ever did. First of all, if the CD has a tiny scratch on it, it won't play it at all. Seacond, it uses sooooo many batteries. I think i put in batteries every other day for this worthless thing. And thirdly, the damn ESP doesn't work. When i try to run it, it makes the CD that i'm listening to very choppy, so i have to turn the ESP off to make it sound normal. If i rotate the CD while it's playing, it will skip. That's how bad it plays. It is the worst player on the market, i don't know why they would ever sell such a thing like this."
2,Only plays MP3 CDs well,"For playing MP3 CDs, the MOJO does almost everything I need and more; it's really a great CD player for the price... It has so many good features. Missing, however, is the capability to fast forward and rewind while playing MP3s. The fast foward and rewind work while playing normal audio CDs, but you can't hear where you're at until you stop fast forwarding or rewinding and play the CD, unlike almost all other CD players that I have used.When playing my normal audio CDs, my MOJO skipped a lot and every now and then would just stop in the middle of a track. My Memorex basic CD player plays these CDs perfectly fine. Because I have so much trouble listening to normal audio CDs, I am going to return this CD player and buy something else."
1,Often fails to play audio CD's,"While the Mojo performs well with MP3 discs, it will certainly disapoint you when you play a regular audio CD. No matter it is a factory CD or your own recorded one, if it is not new it will fail playing too often, even my little daughter cheap CD player has a better performance. Yes, I tried cleaning the lens!"
5,The best,"This is the greatest cd mp3 player available! I don't have enough words to describe this piece of art but I'll try...Prosa) Backlightb) BIG screenc) Cheapd) Long battery life (The batteries included seemed to last forever!)e) Excellent MP3 playback quality (8 to 320 kbps!)f) Yes, it reads ID3, but also it can read FIFg) Equalizerh) 8 minute anti-skipi) No analog volume controlsj) Navigation functionsk) Playlistl) It looks coolConsa) No fast forward in MP3 modeb) Junky headphones"
3,Does not support packet writing as in my RioVolt PSX100:(,"I don't think there is anything on the market as RioVolt's products. My player plays regular CDs, Waves, WMA, & MP3s burned on to CDs, and something the TDK doesn't do - play songs dragged and dropped using Roxio DirectCD. This gives me chance to add/delete songs I get tired of and gives me full control of the content on the CD. Moreover, I save time as I don't have to burn the whole CD each time. It takes me seconds to drag and drop each song or remove song(s). Rio ROCKS!"
3,"Great MP3 player, BUT!","Everything about it is great, the looks, the gadgets, the sound, the screen, etcHOWEVER-uses up batteries like crazy-totally skips when in continuous motion (as in jogging and running, but not, surprisingly, while walking)"
3,"good player, but could have been better","TDK said that you could have made upgrades in the future, like the soul and the Rio-volt, but then they found out that the MOJO which is the OEM of the EXONION avin did not had any. Also I was tempted to buy the exonion in germany for the same price, plus it had rechargable batteries, a remote control, carrying case and a built in recharger, which the MOJO does not have, (cheap TDK). The exonion also have a remote, and tdk took that away. I was tempted to return the MOJO but then if I had to return a product bought in germany because defective, is a pain in the neck. Anyway, a part TDK being a rip off cheap company that had an OEM product and did not know what specifications and features it had, the mojo/exonion is a good player, loud music, easy to read display, and nice features. Too bad TDK ruined a 5 star product removing the recharger for the batteries, the remote, and the protective case.Ciao Aldo"
2,TIME BOMB!!!,"I bought the mojo a little over a year ago and we've had the best of times together -- that is, until recently.To begin with my mojo absolutely refused to play either MP3 cds or normal audio cds, making extremely annoying whirring soundsIn other words, after a year (more or less) of use -- my mojo cutout and refuses to function (after being treated with the utmost respect). It's a complete waste of money -- DONT PURCHASE IT!!!!"
1,This Cd/mp3-Player Is Sketchy,"Look, I'm not the kind of person to complain. However, when the job isn't getting done, I get angry. For just over one year, this Cd-player was the love of my life. Just after the warrentee(sp?) expired, the cd-player died. It refuses to play any cd, audio or mp3. It will hardly boot. It's a major problem. I never dropped it."
2,Needs more work,It has bad parts but its interesting. I liked the idea of a rollercoster time machine. Its also mean how the Captain didn't want to send them back to there own time.
4,Fried convoluted watch,"Read the whole thing last night and haven't laughed so hard in ages!! Filet of leather jacket in saffron cream sauce, Cold shredded children and sea blubber in spicy sauce, YUM!Hilarious!"
3,Not the best it could have been.,"This book is interesting to those of us who study the English language as a way of life. Unfortunately, I found this book to be a bit too far on the dry side. It had the potential of being funny while being somewhat educational, but it seemed to be put together while the author was occupied with other thoughts. I came away from this book with the feeling that while the information and anecdotes included were funny and interesting, the author did not put her full energies into it's creation. I would recommend this book to anyone who travels and/or enjoys the English language, but I would preface that recommendation with a suggestion to take it for what it is worth."
3,Amusing Idea,This book has some really funny parts between filler parts that seem that were included to make the book seem thicker. It also includes parts that are akin to bathroom humour and sometimes profane that aren't necessary to get a good laugh.
5,Unlocking the mysteries,Could not ask for a better book and what Daisaku Ikeda is trying to get across. Very easy to read and assimilate the information.
1,Unhappy purchaser,"Agree with the disapointed purchasers, and wish I had looked at the reviews here before I bought this dog. What a waste of money. The entire listening comprehension section requires use of the tapes, which are not included with the CD version. I feel like I've taken my money and thrown it in the trash. Poor showing from a formerly respected publisher."
4,Norsk Viking Black Metal Elite!!!!!,"The first album ""Again Shall be"" was great and this one continue the saga. Very influenced by Bathory (Viking Era). Mid tempo riff and very nice keyboard touches in some tracks. Is not that band playing faster music like hell, is very intelligent and aggressive with vocals that not sound like a chainsaw but will turn you into a state of mind near the almighty Wotan. I've been waiting and trying to get this album for several years and finally I got it. Is one of the best band and Album from the nineties along with Satyricon, Immortal, Dark Throne, Burzum...VI VIL VINNE!"
1,Disgusting Quality,How can it be so difficult to get a decent mold and at least assemble the parts without gaps and seams showing?The poor sheep is so deformed it barely stays on its feet. If it wasn't for my animal crazy grandson sitting next to me when I opened the package and latched onto these creatures I would have sent it back with an appropriate note of what you can do with these poor excuses of animals.Shame on you for selling such junk!
2,Does smell!,"I read the reviews before I purchased this item for my one year old's birthday. A lot of them claimed that the product had a terrible odor....they were right! I am going to try soaking them in water & bleach before I give them to him and hope that helps. They are a great size and I know he will love them, I just hope I can get rid of the smell! I hope it doesn't mean they are unsafe for children..."
1,Please don't give this to your children.,"We bought this set because our boy likes farm animals.Upon receiving them, we opened the box and it stinks from chemical off-gassing. The paint they use is cheap, and several brush 'touch-ups' have been done to it.The paint does not seem safe, and I would never trust this product to be non-hazardous for my kid to put in his mouth. That is NOT going to be a possibility to worry about, because these are going straight to the trash. Be warned.The chemical stink also stays on your hands after handling them. Disgusting.Besides the scary chemical issues, this set is ugly. The molds are very low quality. The paint bleeds into the contrasting colours, and the animals don't stand up on their own.To conclude, I would feel like an immoral person to donate this toy. It belongs in a land fill, and should never have been made.Please don't buy them. I am contacting the Consumer Product Safety Commission about this product, as I believe it is unsafe."
5,2yo daughter loves her animals,These animals are large for little hands are painted nicely and do NOT smell contray to other posts. My daughter loves saying the type of animal and the noise they make. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for animal figures.
5,Love these!,"I bought these farm animals to go with a wooden barn that I bought for my 4 y/o. They are perfect! I had trouble finding some that were big enough, and I love that they include so many different kinds of animals."
2,Disappointed with these for the price,"Pros:-larger size toy animals, which are hard to find-not ""cartoonish""Cons:-as other reviewers mentioned, the cheap quality of these do NOT justify the high price-these have thick seams around the necks-strong plastic smell-made in China (if that matters to you)"
4,"Great size, smells horribly plastic-y","Toys look great, love the detail and perfect sizes. The only complaint I have is a small one, the toys have a horribly strong plastic smell. Tis won't be a problem after some time I hope, am leaving the box open in a room for a couple of days to see if it goes away. This won't be a problem for people who don't mind that smell.I did look up on the Learning Resourcea website, and they are indeed made from ""durable non-toxic plastic"" . So should the baby get ahold of one I will try not to be too worried about the chemicals in themProduct site here : [...]"
4,good toy...bad price,"I bought this toy for my daughter who is 16 months old. She enjoys them. As she grows, I know she will play with them even more and love them. The only problem I have is that they are not all jumbo and I just saw some plastic animals at a store in the dollar bin that looked pretty good too. Great toy but I think they should be a little cheaper."
4,Great,This set was bought for my young son who loves this. He has had it now for 2 weeks and he spends a lot of time playing with these. Happy to recommend.
2,Not Impressed,"I ordered the Jumbo Farm Animals, the Dinosaurs, and the Jungle Animals. The Dinosaurs were the only ones worth the money. The horse and the Elephant (Jungle) do not stand. The legs are not all the same length, so they tip over. My 2 year old son loves playing with them, but I just don't think they were worth the money. I was definitely disappointed. Like another reviewer mentioned, the animals all have rings around their necks where they were molded together. The size is good, but the quality is bad."
1,Farm Animals Plastic Smell,"While these animals are inexpensive, the quality is cheap. Would be nice play / learning toys, but the wafting smell of cheap plastic scares me as any toddler will put them in his mouth."
3,Watch out for this item !,"We purchased 10 of these for a Cub Scout Activity. We went ahead and assembled one ahead of time to make sure we understood how to do it. The first one out of the box had the cut lines running crooked. Then, it seemed as if the wrong nails were included, dry wall screws. These could be used, but you needed to pre-drill the hole in order to keep the wood from splitting. So we managed through the rest of the sets but we were surprised at the lack of quality control on these made in the U.S.A. items !!"
5,raw.... mesmerizing,"I really can't believe this great album has no reviews, (it just shows how dumb people are). The Finnish horde started around 92"" playing Straight forward, occult, raw northern black metal. With track like ""to burn the kingdom of god"" you know it has to be good. Thanks to a decent production, all the instruments can be heard here despite the rawww material. Diaboli's music is more original than most other ""true"" bm bands today and they stay true to their style unlike the Norwegian idiots turning into techno. This is a killer album and quite enjoyable that will stay on my playlist for a long time (will his other releases) Hail Diaboli ! hail Damnation !"
3,One Song Wonder,"I think GLoria is a very talented woman, but I must admit I bought this for one song. ""I Am What I Am"" I heard this at a public event and loved it.Took me forever to figure out who recorded it, but when I did, I saught it out and bought it!She has a beautiful voice and most of the songs are discoesque, but generally okay. The song I wanted is brilliant. Loved her version of La Caux Au Follies standard. I think you'll enjoy this if you like Disco music."
2,"remix, surprise","The main song is ok but it was unknown to me that this album was a remix. That is unfortunate because it was a gift. Oh well, live and learn."
3,A good intro - but I expected a little more,"Mencken was a well known editor, book reviewer and writer. The selected essays are interesting and often very funny, but I somehow expected a more comprehensive and well-rounded selection of his writings. The book is certainly entertaining and sometimes insightful - hence a purchase to be considered. However, a better job could have been done in selecting the material for the book - including perhaps a selection of his famous aphorisms."
5,Newspaper guy,"I have never read anything by Mencken, but it was high time to do it. This is a good beginning. Mencken may be out of fashion, but his newspaper style is very readable, and he had opinions about everything"
3,Good for beginners in the faith,"The title wasn't exactly descriptive of what I thought the book would be about. It is very short, simple devotional thoughts about Christianity. Not a bad book, but not really deep either."
3,Performance rights?,Are the performance rights included in this DVD? All of these teachers were planning on showing this in their classroom. Our library bought this DVD and it is not that bad just different. It's not slick like so many of the productions now but it does have charm.
5,one of the trippiest freakiest edge of your seat movies seen,"this movie keeps you biting your fingernails and wondering what the hell is going on the entire time, it's great, if you've never seen it, see it, if you have seen it, see it again!"
4,Disturbing symbolism,"This movie is not for the faint of heart and it takes at least 3 times of watching this movie to understand the great symbolism hidden behind the story. From one man's descent almost into hell to his resurrection, the story will go through the life of a man who may seem disturbed, but is only living through a Purgatory. Definitely recommend this movie if you are up to watching it on numerous occasions to understand the meaning behind this movie."
3,Hmm...,"This movie isn't actually bad. The main problem I found with it is that I was led to believe by most people that it was one of the best movies of all time. Working solely on the quality of the movie, I'd give it 4 stars, but after having it built up constantly for such a long time, I was relatively dissapointed. There are several good scares in here, but most of them (other than the hospital scene) work solely off of the surprise factor. The plot isn't as deep as I was told it would be, so I walked away feeling somewhat dissapointed."
3,Amazing Amazing Film,"What can I say that hasn't been said before? Have you noticed the more negative takes on this film include such observations as: ""The film brought up more questions than it answered."" or ""The ending of the film negates the whole rest of the picture.""Well these are the words of people who have no passion for the mysteries of life. Instead of trying to find their own answers, they want the film to tell them the answers. The trouble comes into paradise when you realise no two people can get the same answer. Also the ending of the film only negates the rest of the picture for people who beleive that because we all die, there is no point to life.My intent is to just get you thinking, if you are adventurous, and like to think for yourself, you owe yourself this particular experience. Not to be missed by anyone who knows that really, they don't know anything."
2,It's gonna make sense! It's gonna make sense!,"As I agonized through this movie, I kept thinking to myself, ""Soon, all this crap is going to make sense!"" I was wrong. I shouldn't give away the ending, but I'll tell you this: If you're like me, and after watching this flick for 30 minutes, or 45 minutes, you're just waiting to see what the heck it is all about... just turn it off and turn on something that DOES make sense -- like ""Looney Tunes"" or something like that. If you wait until the end, just waiting to see what it's all about, you will be so disappointed, you might actually be angry!"
1,A bad movie,Not sure why people like this movie. This movie is not working. Just a sequence of scenes between dream /reality. Looks like the director didn't know what to do. I got bored and disappointed.
1,Won't play on Ozzie PS3 or Bluray players,Couldn't review this great movie on it's blu ray release because it's coded and will not play on Australian PS3 or Panasonic 3D Bluray player...so don't buy this version you Aussies!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS..SAME AS PREVIOUS RELEASE NOT 2.35:1 !,Amazon has very misleading info..This is the same transfer(grainy and with artifact) in 1.85:1.. NOT 2.35:1IF YOU DO NOT OWN THIS THEN BUY IT..AWESOME MOVIEUNFORTUNATELY I PURCHASED THIS SAME DVD WITH SAME EXTRAS 3 years ago..ONLY DIFFERENCE---THE COVER ART!!!AMAZON BURNED ME..THANKS AMAZON(SINKING EVEN LOWER..WHERE IS THE BOTTOM FOR YOU GUYS?)..You were the best at one time..not anymore..NOT EVEN CLOSEHOW CAN YOU PUT 2.35:1??? THEY DO NOT MAKE a 2.35:1 copy..DID YOU JUST MAKE IT UP?ASPECT RATIO IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ON A DVD!!
5,Magical realism,"I cannot begin to tell you how much I enjoy this movie. This movie is a classic vision that often is misinterpreted or plain misunderstood. For those of you that have seen this movie and feel that it was confusing or too hard to follow, get this DVD and watch it again. Especially for the commentary and the additional scenes (for those of you that have this on VHS, if you have a DVD player, trust me...it's worth getting it, solely for the added scenes and the commentary.) Every time that I watch this movie it blows me away. The filming, the lighting, the dialogue. It all combines to form a powerful journey of one man's struggle to decipher reality and illusion. All I can say, is ""Phenomenal."""
2,"2 stars for horror, but 5 for great drama.","This is by no means a scary movie, as some viewers would have you believe. I did everything your suppose to do in a psycological horror film, but it just didn't scare me. It had 2 jump out at you parts that made me jump, but that is it. It had great acting, great story, and a confusing plot, but it is definately not for the general public, because you'll find it boring in many places. Once the general public catches this flick, and once real horror buffs see this film, expect the average rating to go down to 2 1/2 stars."
2,I Hate Dream Movies.,"Viewed: 10/11Rate: 410/11: Great, Jacob's Ladder is a dream piece. I've never could stand these films. Adrian Lyne makes an unusual escape from a cycle of films either attempting to recapture the magic created in 9 Weeks or making affairs to get out of hand. But this Jacob's Ladder...that was a waste of my time. I managed to survive it because of Tim Robbins' goofy facials (he is why I thought the film was very funny to watch even though it was meant to be a horror film) and the pretty Elizabeth Peña. I think I've managed to drop a point from the rating because the film contained Macaulay Culkin (I can't ever remember to how spell his name correct) who was oddly not in the opening or closing credits. Anyway, there was a lot of manipulation with the elements during the viewing of Jacob's Ladder, and it ceased to be taken seriously anymore. All in all, Jacob's Ladder should have came with a disclaimer in front of the case: ""It's a dream movie, okay?"""
1,Stinkbomb,"This crazy, nonsensical movie is yet more anti-military paranoia from the Hollywood Left. Be careful! The Army could be putting mind altering substances into your food too! I think the author of this work is the one who has had too many drugs! Save your money, buy the 3 Stooges, they say alot more and with greater intelligence."
1,Not even worth renting.,"I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theatre when it came out. I used a lot of drugs back then, so that explains it. I just watched this again yesterday. Folks, I literally SUFFERED through ""Jacob's Ladder"" this time around. I couldn't wait for it to end. Tin Robbins is usually pretty good, but even he seems bored to death in his role. I would not recommend this film to anyone and I do not understand why it's gotten such high praise."
1,THIS [BAD]!!!,"This movie isn't scary at all, it's a very simple and easy plot to understand, and I predicted the ending 45 minutes before the film ended! This movie [ is terrible], and is criminally OVERATED!!!!! Don't see this, it's a waste of time and energy, and it's plain boring. Even The Fast and the Furious had a more compeling plot than this. Yeah, this movie is that BAD!!!!THIS [BAD] THIS [BAD] THIS [BAD]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,What an aggravating movie!,"Jacob's Ladder means well, and is directed and acted with competence. Disturbing and Nightmarish imagery abound. The story on the other hand, is so incomplete and unsatisfying that left me more confused than it's protagonist. I was actually able to follow the movie well until I reached its nihilistic ending, which not only negated the film, but made the whole experience seem manipulative and utterly pointless."
4,Intense!,Let me say first off that the actress in the film that plays Tim Robbins'love interest is YUMMY! Now that I got that out of the way let's talk Jacob's Ladder. A film about a man who has these totally warped hallucinations that freak him out and embarass him in public. He doesn't believe he's crazy though and he re traces his past to find out that the truth of the madness is more stranger than the fictitious hallucinations he has been having and that there is an explanation for it. Good Flick!
3,"""Jacob's Ladder"" -- unsatsfied w.theatrical","What I want is the original director's cut -- not the one released in theaters and on cable -- that includes ALL of the footage that was intended -- the scenes that were deleted for being too ""draining,"" etc. This is the ONLY way the film should be seen and the only cut that makes sense. When THIS cut is available I'll buy it in an instant. THAT is a masterwork."
4,"A Disturbing, Cerebral Movie!","One of the most bizarre,puzzling movies I've ever seen. The movie was somehow very interesting and made you want to watch it several times and still you get no closer to fully understanding it!A deep movie. A great group-discussion flick!"
2,Blu Ray Quality...Very Poor,"This is a great movie, period! My review is for the Blu Ray quality, which is really very poor quality! The DVD image may actually be better than than the blu ray!"
4,Reviewer gives plot away,"A warning to those who actually like to watch the movie BEFORE they know the ending, the review here titled ""MENTAL HEALTH"" written by ""A viewer from a Sick World""gives away the movie surprise ending. Watch the movie. Avoid spoiler reviewers."
3,a great film sullied by a ripoff DVD,Where are the missing scenes?what are you frightend of?How can you sell this?don't buy it.report this.to thestudionow!
5,For the curious...,"Well, now that you've heard everyone rave about the movie, one might ponder about the deleted scenes on this Artisan Special Edition DVD. ""Jezzie's Transformation"" and ""The Train Station"" are good, and all have good reason to be deleted. But the one sequence that was taken out called, ""The Antidote"", was probably THE most horrific experience I have ever had in my life.I must say that the british sure have a good sense of visual abilities! [Applauds]"
5,A Classic!!!,Beautifully written and great acting. One of the best movies I have ever seen. The Vietnam portion of the film (filmed in Puerto Rico) is haunting. The story is very similar to Carnival of Souls from 1962. Adrian Lyne has created a masterpiece.
3,Definitly a good weekend movie,"This is a very unique movie. no matter how hard I try, I cannot find any other movie that is a family story, a horror movie, a war film, and a thriller all in one. This is the only one.The reason I bought this movie was because I had seen the music video for Avenged Sevenfold's song, ""Nightmare"" which re-enacts the hospital scene...kind of a dumb reason but it was well-worth it.This is definitly not a perfect, completely amazing movie, but it is very interesting. Once you start watching it, you have to find out what happens next.At one point, I watched this movie every saturday and no matter how many times I watch it, it just never gets boring."
4,Still holds up!,"Deeply psychological, this movie looks at a simple man's demons, desires, loves, fears, and hopes, all through the lens of some tragic and unusual war events he experienced. Some elements are slightly dated, like bloody, creepy hospital scenes (or maybe they have just become cliche in part because of this movie?), but it definitely holds up. No amazing special effects or CGIs but still disturbing and frightening. Highly recommended!!"
5,a surreal and disturbing horror movie...,"I've seen this movie many times, and I see something new every time I see it.It' so unusual and so odd - we're never exactly certain what is happening, much less what the movie is about in general.You come away from the movie feeling disoriented and momentarily estranged from your own reality. I came out and immediately wanted to watch my favorite TV show.So what about the movie is so scary? EVERYTHING and on EVERY LEVEL. Demons, blood & guts, mobsters, civil servants, mad scientists, mutants, homeless people, torture, etc...Fans of the TV show Law & Order will enjoy seeing S. Epatha Merkerson playing a flirtatious fotune teller (also potentially scary)."
4,"Creepy, but a little too predictable","Having already been a fan of the Silent Hill games for PlayStation and PS2 (which get much of their inspiration from this film), I was very excited to finally see it. And it is definitely worth seeing. The movie creates a creepy, suspenseful atmosphere right from the start with an unsettling subway scene. From there on out, the movie jumps around from seemingly normal to ""what the heck is going on!"" weird. Although I do have to admit, I had pretty much guessed how the movie would end by about half-way through. Still a good ending though."
3,DVD Version,I had been waiting for this to come out on DVD because I heard that one of the movie channels that showed this movie years ago had a clip at the end with alternate endings. I have never seen that and was hoping when the DVD came out these endings would be included along with a discussion of what the movie was trying to achieve. I was confused when I first saw this and still am. My take was that it was all a delusion or dream as he was being rescued when in the military but now I don't know. If the DVD doesn't answer any of these questions why bother. I probably got the orig on tape somewhere. If anyone has info on the alt endings and when or if they will ever be included please let us know.
3,You mean it wasn't agent orange?,In the late 60's early 70's people were coming back from Viet Nam and just plain freaking out. This film suggests that the Army was experimenting with BZ ( 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate ) gas which has mental effects.It is well known that weed of a very high yield was circulating as wellas a lot of stateside smuggled drugs and prescriptions were abused.But the defoliant called agent orange is said to have the worst long term effects? Mixing drugs and combat can be fatal:and long term psychological effects can be mind blowing.I really doubt the government is responsible for more than putting relatively untrained men into combat and letting them get a hold of the local drugs as well.This movie just does a lot to make a very bad situation worse.
2,NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES,There are NO English Subtitles as it says there are in the DVD Features. I would think subtitles would be a pretty standard feature in DVD movies these days - Artisan Entertainment is just lazy I guess...
1,Bad Movie but it Fools a Lot of Psuedo Intellectuals,"Wow government conspiracies and nonsense. Here it is, the guy gets shot in Vietnam and is dying. He proceeds to have hallucinations and dreams as he (and the movie) die for the next hour or so. None of it makes sense and yet people try to read conspiracies and secret government plans into it. It'all a dream and then he dies. Do not watch this film it's time you will never get back.rmw"
4,WARNING! about the 2010 DVD re-release,"LIONSGATE did not remaster this R1 DVD, the cheap b*stards. this is the same video transfer from the original 1998 DVD release, same cat # and same VOB file creation dates; A 12 -year old transfer! Ive heard they even did a poor job on the BR edition; If you have an all region player buy the UK R2 DVD edition-it was remastered in 2008 and sounds and looks it"
4,Arrived quickly.,I did wish the price was a little lower since I didn't think to check other sellers. But the book was in pretty good shape considering how old it was. My daughter is enjoying this 1st book.
3,Awesome Protection ... Great Value ... \(^u^)/,My step-son has the Mongoose BMX Full Face Helmet and it has an awesome stylish design of a angry Mongoose and the helmet does what is it suppose to do protect your head. It's universal use is awesome. My step-son has used this when I bought him his first dirt bike and currently using it while riding his pocket bike. And the first review is right ... you look cool wearing this than the regular bicycle helmet. He looks like a motorcycle rider who accidentally shrunk his motorcycle in the wash. LOL It's cute and gives him the full protection than the just half a regular helmet would give you. I recommend it for parents who are looking for secure protection from falls and accidents.
3,Hot Hot Hot,"I own a full face helmat similar to this. Now i belive that no matter how much you spend on a full face helmat its worth it. I have had mine for about 3 years. And i love it to death. I'm an avid mountain biker. I try to trail ride 4 to 5 days a week. My helmat has saved my face so many times I cannot keep track. Without it i probaly wouldnt be here. Just last firday I crashed into a black berry bush going 30 mph+. My only complaint/ sugestion, is that it depends on how much and how hard your ride your bike. Yes these types of helmats make you feel indestructable. But they get outragously HOT. THe hot air that comes out goes straigh into your face (because of the mouth gaurd) or right into the top ot the helmat. Now im not trying to discourage you. Full face helmats are the best thing to hit the biking world. But just make sure the helmat you choose has room for you to breath and pleanty of air hole in the top."
1,Not what I really thought it was,Funny but very deceptive. Was not what I really thought it was going to be.
1,Disappointing,I was expecting this to lean more toward rockabilly than punk. Even for punk it's pretty amateurish musically. Neko has the best voice of the 3 Maow-ers but her singing has vastly improved since this came out. Skip this and get her more recent stuff.
5,excellent,"Reading this book was a delight. What got was that Buddy was nobody special at first - just another guy in the American collegiate system. Nonetheless, he took a risk, went to England to train with and compete against the best, and it paid off with a marathon world record.The glimpses into Buddy's mind are great, especially the narrative portion about the Olympic trials at Yonkers. You can't read this book and not love Buddy Edelen."
3,Conscious Rap Approved by Chuck D of Public Enemy,"One of the biggest selling points of this album, distributed by the now-defunct Ichiban Records of Atlanta, was that it was executive produced by Chuck D. of Public Enemy. That it was produced by the pioneer of political rap is a good indication of the album's content, which is socially conscious.Groovy Loo, Al Monday and Grandmaster Vic flow over tracks mostly produced by Rythmatic Flow. While the CD's material is positive and uplifting, the flow of the artists isn't anything remarkable. You might enjoy this album if you're a fan of early 90's conscious music, but don't expect anything in the way of Public Enemy, Arrested Development or Digable Planets."
3,"Not bad, but certainly not good","A bit of a let down really. After the incredible Superwolf comes out, Bonny Billy and Sweeney release this single with three (let's be honest) totally boring songs. More than likely these were tracks left off Superwolf... for a reason."
4,good account,"easy reading, takes you back a few decades-one century...enjoyed reading it.It will stay on my kindle for good time to read again"
5,One Great Book,This is one of the finest books that I have ever read. The book is well written and in very easy to read grammar. It is a great read as far as the Great War is concerned. The pictures are a great plus. I would highly recommend.
5,One of the best movies ever!!,"I remembered seeing this film many years ago and i never forgot it... i'm very happy to have found this film here on amazon. This film completely touched my heart, it made me cry alot, felt so sorry for the little girl. I love films that make me cry, i think its just astonishing how grief affects everyone so differently and the directors portrayed this in such an amazing way with the autism, a really really great film, i would definitely recommend this to anyone, you'll never forget it."
2,A miracle cure for autism? Nah!...A Hollywood cure? Yes.,"This film is strictly Hollywood hype. A child showing all the symptoms of being autistic is miraculously cured by the actions of her mother, as she heroically stands up to: a) child welfare workers; b) physicians and/or psychotherapists with many years of experience dealing with autistic children; and c) common sense.Here is Kathleen Turner snatching her autistic child away from these screaming meanies, and finding her own cure for her daughters autism, although she refuses to learn anything about the disease she most unrealistically cures.This movie slaps parents of autistic children in the face with its simplistic Hollywood style cures for a most difficult medical problem."
4,A mothers love...,"Kathleen Turner is wonderful as a mother trying to do the best she can to help her withdrawn daughter. Tommy Lee Jones is a 20 yr. veteran of traditional child psychology trying to help her daughter the best way he knows how and not alienate the mother in the process. Mom has some very untraditional ideas of how to reach the girl and in the end both come to respect, if not understand, each others views. Strong performances from all characters and a good story line that is quick and never boring."
4,dealer's choice,"though i may be a bit biased as i have worked with adults with developmental disabilities for years & was working with a woman with autistic tendencies when i saw this movie for the first time, i must say i *really* liked it. in a society where we're all so detached & compartmentalized, it was great to see a story where a woman who isn't an ""expert"" be motivated to try to understand her daughter instead of trying to ""fix"" her. i can attest from actual experience that this seems to be the most crucial element to reaching anyone (autistic or not). it was also refreshing to see options other than medication be explored (i personally believe drugs can be wonderful blessings, but that they are turned to far too often & far too quickly in this day and age)it was simply the luck of the draw that i came across this movie, but want to share my fortune with others ~ enjoy the movie!"
4,"Good Premise, but a bit hard to understand mechanics.","I would say that the basics of this movie is quite good, but the mechanics of it left both my wife and me puzzled. Here, we have a little girl who not only recently lost her father, but was moved from the southern Mexican she knew back to the U.S. to a life that was strange to her. So, she withdrew into herself. To reach anyone like that, indeed to reach anyone who needs help, one must be able to reach out them on their level and within their capacity. In this case, that of supposed autism, the mother had to learn to think as an autistic child. Only then would she be able to reach her hurting daughter. The movie holds one's interest, even if you don't understand the means used by the mother to reach her daughter to help her break through her grieving to start to heal."
3,Would have been good except for the ending,"I won't give the details but the movie starts out rather strong. Asha Menina, who plays ""Sally"" out-acted all of her more famous adult counterparts -- and a site listed her as being 8 at the time!!! Oddly this is her only credited movie/tv appearance. My wife and I were like ""Wow...she can act"". However, just as the plot thickens and the movie is getting really good...it ends...with a nice wrapped up in a bow total resolution practically ex deus machina style ending... My wife, teenager and I all looked at each other in disbelief like ""that's it?"". Other reviewers wondered if the movie was messed with a bit much in post-production. There is probably good reason for that."
5,This Video will make you pee your pants!,"This is some of the craziest stuff I have ever seen in my life. Burning feet man sets his feet on fire to help people out, Tom Green helps his buddy Glen to train to be an astronaut at the state fair with bad results, and the mustard inspector makes a visit to some local grocery stores. This video is great, it will make you laugh because it's so sick and disturbing but ultimately hilarious. Keep it going Tom!"
2,Definently not the Tom Green you've seen on MTV.,"Ok, I am a huge Tom Green fan. Can't get enough of him. But this video was more than enough. True, it does have some very funny clips on it, but on this video they're pretty rare. There's only two segments that have been on the MTV version and most of this is either stupid or disgusting or both. I think Tom had to tone down his act for MTV and his old act wasn't very funny at all. There's about 8 or 9 funny skits on this, but that's out of about 30. I like the MTV Tom Green a lot better than the Canadian Tom Green. From this video I can tell he improved greatly and Tom and MTV are perfect for each other, but in Canada, it was a mismatch."
4,An Awesome CD!!!,"I bought this CD last year, because I loved the Prom Night remake! (Unlike some people who hate its guts) I saw Prom Night the first day it came out when I was on spring break! Then, I saw it again on May 9th, 2008, the night before my Prom! I was a nominee for Prom King, but I lost. My favorite songs on this soundtrack so far are Time of the Season, and Paralyzed! I highly recommend the PROM NIGHT ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK!!!"
1,Don't waste your money...,"I bought these thinking maybe I could get the same benefit of the new Sketchers or Reebok work out shoes, but after trying both, I can tell you that these insoles do absolutely nothing!! I wore them around the house over the course of two days, and other than feeling nice, I felt no difference with or without them on. I've gone to shoe stores and have tried on both Sketchers and Reeboks versions....and even though they may look a bit odd, the Sketchers are definitely the ones to go with. I will be buying those asap!"
3,"Comfy, but I don't 'feel the burn'","I've worn these several times, and they are comfy. They do cushion your feet. But I haven't felt any muscle tightening or toning. There's no soreness or anything to indicate they're working my muscles.One thing I do warn, be prepared to need to buy at least a half size bigger shoe, cause they do take up room.Not horrible, but I'm not singing their praises either."
3,Eh...,"I bought these as an alternative to spending a hundred bucks on those fancy workout shoes that everyone's into lately. I thought these would be similar. Eh. Kinda, but not really. I have bad knees and these insoles definetly improve posture and walking patterns (the package tells you to 'step into the gel with your heel and roll your foot forwards'. Once you do this for a while you will ""unconsciously keep doing it"". I feel like... that's the only way I know how to walk, so how is that going to help?)Granted, they help posture, are good for people with bad arches, and redistributes the shock forces of your actual foot hitting the ground so you don't feel it in your heals so much. But as for a work out tool and toning muscles? Not convinced. Yeah, if you use them to workout, you'll get muscle tone. But that's because you're working out, not from the shoes... silly.Buy it if you have bad knees, bad posture, or low arches. Otherwise don't expect too much..."
1,OUCH!,"After one use the tips of my toes are blistered! Granted, I have the kind of feet where the second toe is longer than my big toe but it's not a problem for the other insoles I've used. These insoles put your feet in a downward position...like a mini heel inside your shoe. Because of that, your toes are pushed to the front of your shoe the entire time you're walking or jogging. I literally took my shoes off and walked the rest of the way home, barefoot! I came home and put my Spenco cross-trainer insoles back into my shoes and it felt like a dream once again! I think these insoles would be much better if they extended the length of the shoe so your feet were protected all the way down, like normal insoles. I will be happy to send them to you if you'd like to lose a toenail too, like I'm clearly about to do! :)"
3,Good padding,"These insoles offer good padding. I'm an OR nurse on my feet for 8 hours a day and I stuck them in my old tennis shoes at work. They make a nice padding but I don't feel the ""workout"" qualities that they were boasting. Good sizing. I wear 10 wide shoe (I think work shoes are 8 mens) and the mediums fit fine."
2,Not like the real thing...,These are a little cushion that is comfortable to wear in a loose shoe. They do not do anything else as far as anti-cellutlite effect while wearing. I would not buy again.
2,Smartsole not smart for me.,"These insoles seemed like a great idea to me. However, they didn't work in any of my shoes. Raised my foot up too high out of shoes and were just not comfortable. You need to take the entire inside of your own shoe out to try to fit this in. Today's shoes come with so many nice insoles that putting these in just defeated the purpose."
5,Great for Long Walks,"These insoles are so comfortable. Even on long walks, my feet don't hurt. I don't know about the anti-cellulite aspect, but they would work for anyone who is on their feet a lot."
1,Not impressed,I had hoped for more. I wore these daily and I got more out of walking in a good pair of flip flops. Not for me.Lisa in Alabama
4,Smart Soles are a smart idea!,"I have purchased smart soles before and absolutely LOVE them. I usually wear them in my sneakers and they are great for work outs and walk/running. They also last for quite awhile, which is a nice bonus."
2,Can't tell any difference,"I knew going in that 'reducing cellulite' was a joke but I did think I'd enjoy some additional benefits over any other insole. I was wrong. They are comfortable and the cushion is nice but otherwise, they do nothing."
2,Disappointment,"Another reviewer said these were just ordinairy shoe inserts, I got them anyway and I agree. I own Shapeups which are fantastic. As far as insoles, I think the Dr. Scholl's for back pain are the best I've ever tried and cost less then the Smartsoles."
3,"Comfortable, but not an anti-cellulite product","I was looking for a comfortable, long lasting shoe insert. Any inserts I have found in other stores, just didn't hold up. The SmartSole inserts are comfortable, and brought new life to my sneakers, but I have not seen nor was I expecting an insert to help with cellulite, unless you are exercising daily as well. Nice product, should only be worn in sneakers. I tried to put them in regular shoes, but they made the shoe too tight."
3,"Not What I expected, but comfortable!",The insoles are really confortable and I wear them all the time. I don't really notice a change in my legs at all.
2,Nice insoles but not much else,"These are nice good quality insoles, but I don't see them doing anything else for me at this time, maybe this will change over a few more months of wear or something but as of right now all I have is new insoles. Felt nothing like ""a burn"" etc on my legs or anywhere else. Not saying they are not a good product, just not worth the price for a set of insoles for your shoes."
3,wonderful for that shy child,this book was inspirational and enlightening. The family had alot of issues. With those issues the author created laughter and suspense.A great book for any child's libary.
3,Enjoyed it after I was finished reading.,"Dichotomy --division into two usually contradictory parts. I struggled with putting pragmatic people and their pragmatic ways (yes, I know, like we adults) in the same plot line with a creative, imaginative little girl -- one who clearly lived in a fantasy world. Walt Disney Fantasia music with pictures would be fun to do with this work. I enjoyed mostly the fantasy part of the book which might mean I still have the child in me.After finishing up, I liked the story; I agree with another reviewer that this is for older children who can say believing in Santa Claus is in their past."
2,"boring plot, good charactors","I was awfully bored to read about a goose that flys a child across a pond. though the story had a nice idea, it wasn't captured well, it could have been s short simple book. But writing it as a short novel was a mistake. The only thing I enjoyed about this book is the charactors. Langton did an excellent job of making outstanding charactors, as as Uncle Freddy. Besides that, I most certainly don't recommend it."
5,From the Garage to Hell and Back...,"If you've ever been to Spokane, Wa. then you might understand where ""The Hunger"" came from. Like a cat with its tail caught in a lawn mower blade, this album has enough explosive energy to power all the hair dryers from Lynnwood to Kent Washington! If you are at all interested in true 'Rawk 'n Roll the hits harder than a jelious [girl], then buy this CD immediatly!"
4,There's nothing wrong with this cd...it can be enjoyed,"I think ""Tropical"" is a wonderful cd and this merengue can be enjoyed. It definitely does not compare to other albums in their repertoire such as "" Los mundialmente sabrosos"" from 1993 or ""Los Dueños del Swing"" their album from 1995 however; it's still a reflection of their capacity to produce ""good"" merengue. Not all the songs are going to catch your attention, but there are few that are ""hits"" such as: Fin de semana, Y es fácil, Rompecintura and Dígale que no. If you are a fan of Los Hermanos Rosario and you wish to continue collecting their music, this cd is a worthwhile purchase. In spite of the views of the other reviewers on this product page, I think the cd does merit some recognition. You'll enjoy it, I'm sure of that."
2,This is mediocre at best--only for collectors,"If you collect tribute CDs to A/C D/C, as I do, then it is worth the $$.If you care not for tribute CDs unless they are outstanding, skip this one."
2,not bad... whats hometown?,"very very very very mediumthey are good musician...its like the originals songs,justbig balls sound like a circus musicall others are good but its reallynot Bon Scott!"
3,"Great Message, Mediocre Presentationism, Poor Acting And Outrageously Priced!","About the only purpose I could imagine this would be an effective lesson, and/or educational tool, would be for enlightening non-believers with short attention spans. I did not see or here anything worth the price of admission (to this film), that a true believer shouldn't already be WELL AWARE of!The message Is Concrete, and you would have to work much harder than this to disturb it. Yet, charging people nearly $16 for a poorly produced film lasting about 16 minutes, can only be described as OUTRAGEOUS!This pitifully attempted project that shows three individuals being interviewed and their testimonies. What you get are three scripted accounts of poorly read material.I Pray That The Sellers Will Have The Decency To Post The Runtime For Future Perspective Buyers!In close...Again I state, This Is A Great Message! But, This Is An Extremely Poor Delivery Of It!"
2,Ships from China,I was hoping this product would act as a coupler between my Apple DVI to S-video plug from my old MBP AND the new Display Port to DVI plug for my new MBP. Didn't do the trick. Perhaps those adaptors were not designed to do that and this product isn't at fault. My issue is with the 3 weeks of shipping coming from China. I'm really getting annoyed with the number of Marketplace sellers on Amazon (and Buy.com and Bestbuy.com) that really don't deserve to be associated with a reputable retailer. They do a clever job of disguising the fact that your purchase is coming all the way from China and won't arrive for about 3 weeks. I'd really rather pay an extra couple of dollars and have the option of returning it if I'm not happy with the purchase. I think Amazon needs to vet their outside sellers better.
5,A classic in its own right,"This was released on TV in the UK during Christmas 2002. I was reluctant to watch at first being a big fan of the 1939 version starring Greer Garson and the wonderful Robert Donat; I was glad I did though.It features areas of James Hiltons novel not covered in previous films. However, this makes them no less credible!It will remain high on my list of favourite films!!"
4,My 9 year old grandson was happy with the sword.,My 9 year old grandson was happy with the sword. He likes that it snaps intothe scabbard so it won't fall out and has a place to put a string through tofasten to his belt loop.
4,Nice for price,Looks great. I bought two swords for my twins. For now both of swords are broken :)Can not hold side to side move. broken on connection place with handl.:)
4,Not that Bad as the say!,"Okay there are alwys people who are afraid of something new! , wel then you should not be bying this cd! Because it has a new sound! You may think it's bad, but is not that bad at all, if you listen to this you wil find that it is very danceable too, so if you like new things, and like to dance? buy this one!"
4,A talented young Australian who deserves every success!,"I was excited to hear the US version of Real Life and I wasn't disappointed by the new addition ""Free"" which is also on the soundtrack for the new Susan Sarandon and Natalie Porter movie, ""Anywhere But Here"". The other new addition to the CD is the song, ""Even When I'm Sleeping"" which was originally released by Sydney based group 'Leonardo's Bride'. Although the original was great, Marie also does the song justice. I was disappointed that the song ""Impossible"" was left off the US version as it is one of my favourite songs on the albumn and I wonder why it didn't make this CD?Overall, Marie shines in her debut CD release as a signed artist. I hope she makes it back to the US in the near future. I am originally from Melbourne and I have missed hearing her perform."
3,"Been there, done that","First off, I'm a huge Prince fan. And I hate to complain, but I just don't see why this release is necessary, for two reasons: (1) The 3 hits contained herein are already available on the aptly-titled ""The Hits"" DVD, and (2) there are PLENTY of Prince music videos that have never gotten a home video release of any kind...not to mention the SIGN O THE TIMES concert film. It just kinda bugs me that Warners would put out something like this, when there's so much more to choose from.BUT...if you are a fan, you might want to have it anyway. I bought the VHS version in the early 90's, and I'm content with that. The only other video of note is the Spike Lee-directed ""Money Don't Matter 2Nite."" The rest is just filler, in my opinion. They could have at least released the bonus remix videos of ""Gett Off"", including the rare ""Violet the Organ Grinder"" video (which, thankfully, I also have on tape)."
3,D&P,"Mostly music videos, I was hoping for more live concert footage.Overall, it is good to have for my Prince library."
1,Incorrect Region Code,Label shows region 2 (U.K)but would not play. Wrong region on screen. Managed to get a friend to re-record correct region after some effort.
2,An Acquired Taste,"It's not just the music, it's the whole thing. If you're into yourself more than pleasing the customer then I just don't know what to tell you about this video."
3,Mediocre Product,"This paper towel holder is very sturdy and stays put. It's easy to replace the new roll, by simply squeezing the top two buttons and removing the top. However, there was paper towel dust constantly on the stainless steel bottom. It did not matter which brand of paper towels I used either. For some this may not be bothersome, but for me it was. The point in purchasing this towel holder was to solve a problem, not to create another one!"
3,beware of poor packaging,I just received two paper holders with several dents and scratches. Amazon threw the two holders and several air bags in a huge box to ship. I am so disappointed by the Amazon's unprofessional packaging methods.
