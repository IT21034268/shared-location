3,Low build quality,"This gamepad has the best key layout of any PC gamepad I've tried so far. If the mouse wheel were replaced with another button, it would be perfect. The software to set it up is pretty decent too (For the non-TE version only).The problem is that it's only going to last you 3-4 months of regular usage tops. The spacebar/shift button will probably be the first to go. It'll start squeeking, then bind up in crucial moments. The D-pad will be next... But the rest of the keys will all start squeeking soon enough.After mine wore out, I tried the TE version. Unfortunately, while the main array of keys is higher quality, the D-pad and spacebar are the same. To make matters worse, the TE software is an abomination.It is worthy of three stars, simply because of it's fantastic layout, but if you're going to get one, get the non-TE, and plan on replacing it regularly."
2,Mac users beware,"I bought it because I wanted something for World of Warcraft. I never get the hang of WASD and wanted to have arrow keys available for left hand use. Most USB number keypads are not Mac compatible. The Nostomo Speedpad n52 worked as desired when I used it with my Windows PC, but I bought it because I knew I was getting an iMac and it was listed as Mac compatible. Well, instructions for Mac users are useless, and apparently, my new iMac isn't supported despite the support for OSX. Tried using ControllerMate to get it to work, but the layout for that program made zero sense to me - and I work in IT and hack my equipment - both PC and Mac - all the time, so it's not because I'm computer illiterate.Belkin's web site is so horribly designed as to be useless, and like the manual, the online support is PC-centric. As it stands, it was money wasted."
5,Amazing.,"This product is amazing, it came in perfect condition and works perfectly. I use it to play World of Warcraft and it makes the gameplay ten times better."
4,Great item. easy to install and use.,"the n52 looks complicate at first but after a few tries to set up the buttons, it's nothing at all. It works great with all my games. I use it mainly for 9dragons, perfect tool for it."
1,Was Good,One of the buttons stopped working days after I got it. Didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning it. What a bummer:(
1,1 star for nostromo but 5 stars for Amazon,"First one was defective, Amazon sent me a replacement right away.Second one came and I tested it out with several games. I then found it to be completely useless and annoying to use. I will stick with WASD keys with number and function keys in easy reach OR an analog game pad for other games. There are many free utilities out there for creating macros for button/key combos.... so even that is no big deal for Nostromo. It actually gets in the way because you still need to use your keyboard for other things.I was hoping it would really help my game with World of Warcraft or be useful for Darkspace (another online game)."
2,Not For Rights,"This Is very Bad Get A Joystick Or Stay With the Keyboard, And if you are a righty this is not for You, the only good thing is It Can Be Good For RTS Games Like: Empires Dawn Of The Modern World And I have A Life This Is SO BAD I AM Making A review + it got lead in it SOoooooooo"
1,Bad watch,Watch stops at some o'clock every week. Also for a month of use some times showed incorrect date. It is necessary to return to the manufacturer.
1,Unreliable,"Pros: I like the look and feel of the watch. The weight is nice and the bezel has a very nice positive feel.Cons: I've noticed that the watch will periodically lose several minutes to several hours over the span of a couple days.The problem is so bad, that I have to re-calibrate the time about once-a-week, and I check the accuracy several times each day whenever I do wear it because just don't trust the watch. I'm planning on returning it soon."
5,great everyday watch,"Great everyday watch. Nothing too fancy and not too much money that you have to feel bad if something happens to it. Surprisingly, band was too large for my husband, who is a big guy. The links can be removed to adjust the fit although it was difficult. Still, I highly recommend this watch."
3,LOVE HATE,"I'VE HAD 3 OF THESE AND LOVED THEM FOR ABOUT 10 MONTHS. THE CASE IS BRASS THAT WEARS AND THEN STARTS GOING AFTER YOUR WRIST LIKE SANDPAPER AT JUST BEFORE A YEAR. THIS WATCH WOULD BE PERFECT IN ALL STAINLESS, NOT JUST STAINLESS BACK. I'D CERTAINLY PAY THE DIFFERENCE, BUT THEY ALL HAVE DONE EXACTLY THE SAME THING,"
2,"Looks and feels great, but can't keep time!","I really wanted to like this watch. Problem is, even with replacing battery with a new one, about every 5 days I look at it and realize it's 5-10 minutes slow. I should have returned it but frankly it wasn't worth the hassle.I should add that I know many other people with Timex Expedition watches who love them and have no problems. Maybe I just got a bad one."
2,disappointed,"I bought this watch to replace very similar model which I liked very much. I had it for a few years and was very happy with it. But recently somehow I lost the crown, probably pulled it out by a backpack strap.So I decided to buy the same watch. I compared my old watch with the picture of this model and was sure it's exactly the same watch.When I got the watch I was immediately disappointed by the fact that the bezel on the new watch was fixed and couldn't rotate. I am not a diver, but I find it very handy to time activities using rotating bezel.Oh well, I can live without rotating bezel. But just about a 3-4 weeks after I bought the watch I lost the crown again!Now I am going to buy Invicta watch with screw down crown."
1,Does not work!,This product does not work. It does not keep time. I have kissed 35.00 (plus 7.00 to get it fitted) away and tossed this POS in the garbage.DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
3,Moisture Condensation Inside Display Case,"I brought this watch about 20 months ago. It took a beating from my kind of wear and it still kept on working nicely! However, it had tons of moisture condensation inside the display case. I think this occured after I kept this watch inside the bathroom during showers, it's not a good idea. I used a cig lighter to heat the display case/glass and it removed some condensation. This morning I kept the cig lighter on for too long and it melted the displays inside the case/glass! I had to throw it out. I would gladly buy this watch again but if I could find out how to deal with the condensation issue! other than that, this watch is a classic and reliable. Just don't keep it in the bathroom during showers."
3,Men's Timex,"The watch itself is awesome, the band is a pain in the [...]. It's going to cost you an extra 5 bucks and for me a couple of trips to the jeweler to have the band adjusted to fit you. I love the watch, but they could have used band that didn't have to be taken to a jeweler for adjustment."
2,"Great looking, quality problem","Love the way this watch looks and its glow-in-the-dark hands/markers, but it has a problem with keeping accurate time. I haven't totally figured it out, but I know that one problem is with the stem pulling out into the time set mode. It appears that sometimes it just keeps time slow. Whatever the case, I am going to return it and seek a refund."
2,I really wanted to like this watch but...,"This watch had everything I was looking for in a watch. Great looks, Indiglo, long life battery, all steel, water proof, very good reviews by others. The one thing I really needed was a rotating bezel as the description states. Strange how some reviewers state the bezel works great and others say it does not turn. Mine did not turn no matter how hard I tried. Sounds like there is a quality assurance problem at the factory. I sent mine back."
2,A disappointing Wait,"I was excited to order this watch. I currently own a Timex expedition with a leather band which is wearing out so I was looking forward to the metal band.One problem right off the bat, which really upset me, was that the bezel ring did not rotate. One Amazon image show the bezel rotated. I requested a refund immediately.Everything else seemed to work fine including the Indiglo (I am a huge fan of this)."
5,Great Watch,This is a very good watch for the price. I had the same model for a number of years and never had to replace the battery. The only reason I bought a new one was I fell and broke the last one.
5,Franky,The DVD's of Frank Sinatra were done in a professional way. I liked the fact that he did what he does best..sing!
2,Fuzzy,Video quality on the older shows is quite fuzzy and poor looking. I've seen other material from this era that looked so much better. Performance and content are superb but marred by substandard picture quality. Not a HD selection!Maybe some other manufacturer will do better.
4,Why not remastered ?,"The Sinatra Family is to be congratulated for devising this box, but the label Shout! Factory left the desired product quality. The record company Sony launched the 007 totally remastered DVDs. Years 1960, 1970, ... A work like Sinatra deserves the same quality as the record company Sony has with regard to his films. The label Shout! Factory would follow the label Sony and appreciate the value that every person deserves to make Sinatra. I believe that many people had the same disappointment when they received this box in their homes. great dvds, great content. Congratulations Sinatra Family."
4,Great but similar concerts.,"6 discs of multiple concerts each, plus 1 disc of features. Each concert is great in itself, but understandably many of the same favorite tunes appear in each, resulting in less variety than one might expect. The disc of features is of extra interest in that it includes a 26 minute Christmas show with Bing Crosby, and a review of Frank's life,""Vintage Sinatra"", with recent observations by Frank's 3 ""children"": Nancy, Tina an Frank Jr. Overall, a very good set."
4,Feedback on Frank,"This set is truly comprehensive picture of Frank's performances over the years, the older clips are very nostalgic. I would have loved some rat pack inclusion for the Vegas shows but that material is pretty rare. We actually bought a set when we were on holidays in the US and then when a friend expressed keen interest in a copy and we couldn't buy it locally in Australia we had another sent from Amazon in under two weeks. Good entertainment for any Frank fan."
4,So pleased I bought this,This was a dlightful gift for a lifelong Sinatra fan. And the only place I could find to get the Japan concert that is playable in North America!
5,Hitches?,"Some of the specials don't hold up very well between songs (as a comedian Frank took a back seat to Dean Martin) but the music is great and the live concerts show just how great a performer Sinatra was. The last, from 1985, is one of the best performances in the collection.However, played on a brand new Blu-Ray player I have a slight hitch or hiccup between two songs on the Buddokan disc and when Frank introduces the next song after Buddy Rich's extraordinary performance of the ""West Side Story"" Medley."" Anyone else or is this just a couple of bad discs?"
5,Frank Fantastic,The Frank Sinatra Concert Collection Is absolitley wonderful for fans of the master.The orchestrations you will never hear again like they are in this collection & the master performs with brilliance
4,Good news for Sinatra fan !,"Once I heard about that new item,and saw the programm, I instantly realized that it is, for the greatest part of the set, a re-issue of ""Sinatra : A life in performance"", released a few years ago in 2 dvd-set (1 of 10 + 1 of 3, including Concert for the Americas, The Fourty first years and Sinatra and Friends 1977). Undoubtfully, it is an absolutely must have for all fans of ""The chairman of the board"". I don't know the bonuses featured in that new DVD box but surely there are also gems.I am certain that the SINATRA family has still many treasures in their vaults, to reveal, carefully, one by one..."
2,Good: Music---Bad: Quality,"I have the original DVDs of these performances. Those DVDs were taken from the VHS masters that came out in 1990. The original DVDs had just average picture quality, so I bought this new set expecting a visual upgrade, since the last transfer was done 20 years ago. I am so disappointed in this set...the picture, and sound, quality is exactly the same as it was on the original DVD set. It's in stereo, not 5.1 sound, and the picture still looks like a VHS tape.The performances on the 1st DVD are terrific, don't get me wrong. The Royal Albert Hall show is great, as is the bonus disc. The rest of the discs are totally dispensable.So if you've got the original DVDs, don't bother getting this set. I'll be returning mine."
2,Not that great!,This bible is ok not as good as the NIV student/ Study Bible and where near the Level of the John McArthur study bible the only benefit is that its from a Charasmatic/Penetoscal slant but definetly lacking in scholarship. It doesn't even have cross refrences which is essential in order compar scripture to scripture in order to have an indepth study of the word. I was disappointed i was looking for Chrasmatic/Pentecostal study bible I got shalow study filled wtih penecostal thought.
4,Very nice,"I've slept on worse, but not much better. These sheets are comfortable and seem durable, too."
5,great product,I have always used Hodgson Mill Barley Bread Mix since I got my bread machine years ago. My local stores stopped stocking the Barley bread mix so I turned to the internet for my product. Completely satisfied with any of the Hodgson Mill products that I use.
5,Consistently wonderful bread!,"Our family has been enjoying the Barley Bread for a couple of months. It is so easy to make it in our breadmaker and we love its hearty taste. Toasts up great, too. We have been also ordering Hodgson Mill's Honey Whole Wheat and 9-grain for over a year now and have had perfect delivery service and beautiful breads from every package we have received."
3,Barley bread,"Like it,but it was not impressive in any way,will stick with the 9 grain bread we also use from the same company."
5,Bread Machine Mix,"This is my first experience with Hodgson bread mix, and I am totally satisfied with the product. Some reviews stated problems with the yeast packets being outdated, but that was not my experience. The yeast performed as it should. The bread makes a dense loaf and is very good. I will order again."
2,Get Your Dehydrator Ready,"When I purchased this camp cook book, I didn't realize that the recipes would all share one thing in common: they involve using the food dehydrator at home before the camping trip. It's really a gourmet dehydrator food cook book!"
3,Cooking When Camping,"This ""camping cookbook"" has some very good ideas in it. Most of the recipes, however, do not seem to practical for tent camping considering the lack of storage and refrigeration. Using a home dehydrator is an excellent idea. If one were camping with an RV these recipes would be very useful."
2,I;m a camper not a cooker,"My husband and I are avid campers, and granted we like to eat well. But a nice grilled steak or a trout with lemon slices and pepper wrapped in foil with a salad on the side, takes only minutes to prepare and is just as good to us as a meal we would spend hours at the coleman to make.And those meals would leave us time to play in the woods, swim, or sight see. Granted the book has some cool ideas and tips but as a cookbook to the dedicated camper instead of the gourmet, forget it."
5,Doesn't Get Any Better,"Cziffra was a genius, pure and simple. I had the fortune of hearing him live and I can't think of anything that could have been more thrilling. He takes Chopin to new heights which isn't easy considering where you start from."
1,3rd rate photomontage,"Compared to Jerry Uelsmann's work, these images are boring, unimaginative, and technically mediocre. The book also suffers from misregistered half-tone printing."
5,Labtec LCS 1050,"These speakers are great for my purpose. They are quite compact and wanted to use them on my laptop whose built in speakers are anemic. The price is right and the sound is excellent despite it not having a base/treble control. You just don't need it because sound is so well balanced. If you are looking for small, inexpensive, good quality speakers I just don't see how you can do any better than buying these."
4,Decent computer speakers,"I bought these speakers to improve the awful sound of my laptop computer. They are a lot more powerful than I thought. They have deep, clear bass and reasonable treble separation. I like the built-in AC adapter, the separate bass/treble and volume controls and the front mounted headphone jack. The size is fine for my needs, about 9 inches high. The downside is that there is a little distortion at very high volume, but not at normal listening levels. Construction quality seems to be OK, though this is the first Labtec product I have owned. All in all, a pretty good sounding speaker for the price. Certainly not audiophile, but for those looking to upgrade their computer sound at a reasonable price, the Spin 60 speakers are worth checking out."
5,"Top-notch speakers with a great ""simple"" design","All companies need to take note of this ""simple"" pair of speakers. The speakers get the job done extremely well. And it doesn't use a bulky, box-like AC adapter; its internal power supply fixes that problem. Also, the speakers don't have a subwoofer. I know, I know, some people prefer a subwoofer and I used to have one myself. Still I can't tell the difference; this speakers sound exceptional without one.Plus it has microphone and headphone ports, so after you hook up these speakers the ports become incredibly accessible! I definitely recommend these speakers for anyone.And I think this pair is essential for computers with internal speakers. There nothing like having a volume control knob (especially when the alternatives are annoying sound control slider bars or keys)."
2,"big size, average sound","not impressed at all, the powered speaker is stronger then the left and the controls are not very good..."
1,exceptionally poor quality,"Had to post this. Grrrr!!!! 6 weeks in, the second speaker now puts out about 20% volume of the first. 8 weeks in, both speakers drop an additional 50% volume output. Not worth the time ordering. However, they are a good size for target practice."
1,Take these back to Labtec,The left speaker stopped working after 3 months. Get anything that isn't Labtec. Big waste of money.
3,Cannot say if it's good or bad,"I only used them for one day. I'm taking them back because of their size too big for my type and the right speaker is too heavy to put on hand-made shelf I plan to make for more space. The store didn't have Spin 50, so I will get them elsewhere. I can live with extra cord (power adapter)."
1,Poor Quality,"Item was shipped quickly. Worked okay in pseudo ""3D surround sound"" mode, but in regular stereo mode the left speaker produced nothing but static. Very disappointed."
4,Labtec LCS-1070 3-D Surround Sound Speakers,I think that this is a very good product. It offers easy installation and sounds great!I would recommend this to anyone!
2,not worth it,"I found these speakers to be average. you would be better off going with the $5 speakers available at any office supply store. the sound was decently loud, but quality degraded as the sound went up. the actual shapes of the speakers are not as pleasing as the picture might make it seem."
5,a work of remarkable depth and acuity,"Above all, this is a great read. Omer-Sherman takes a dynamic approach to the entwined ways that the biblical world and the contemporary one speak to each other through the modern Hebrew writer's imaginative juxtaposition of space, landscape, and ideology. The author's use of the desert as a lens or trope creates a very fresh approach to Jewish writing, that can accommodate parts of the Bible, some current Israeli fiction, and some Diasporic writing as well. The book also draws on, in a truly appealing way, the author's years of living in the Israeli desert. Hence, the wilderness emerges as a real physical place as well as a highly-charged metaphor. The style is crisp and energetic, clear and jargon-free, and keeps the reader engaged in the details of works and in the main thrust of the project as a whole."
4,Good product,I ordered this as I already had one and wanted another. This one was twice the price of the one I got at the supermarket. But we had to spend an Amazon gift card.
2,Price = Quality,"Well, I thought I couldn't go wrong giving this cable a try since it is so inexpensive and I am still glad I did so, because now I know what I do now. And that is; Price really does matter. I received this cable and it is much worse due to artifacts then my component cables.There are large white/black diamonds and blocks (several pixels) every few seconds that appear randomly all over my screen for split seconds. HDMI is digital so I figured it is either on or off. Correct, but there still can be interference, and the single may get messed up, and this creates artifacts.Anyways, if you have any doubts it really doesn't hurt to try these cheap cables. But for people who don't want to waste the time, just go with expensive well made cables."
2,Lame,"I like goofy indepenant films, but this effort just goes nowhere.There are a few moments that make me smile, but I wouldn't recommend this unless you feel like looking a a couple pretty girls for an hour+.I'm not a fan of the poor ""acting""; it would have been better to have them just be themselves, natural and informal.Pass this one by!"
1,Doodle Dud!,My daughter is a huge Blue's Room fan and we thought this toy was a great gift for her. We were very wrong! You have to push the pen VERY hard to get it to even draw on the super small space. The paw that slides to erase the board isn't very easy to move either which adds to her frustration. The toy also hasn't held up very well with the little play it's had. IT really wasn't worth the money spent on it!
2,Was cute could have bought something else,There is nothing special about this toy and it broke within a couple of weeks. I would stick to Leap Frog.
3,"Decent text, lame exercises","I am sort of in between all the other reviwers on this one. The text seems okay for a intro. into the subject. There is enough information to teach a class and I assume it _is_ designed for someone with little to no previous knowledge in computer architecture. Although it sure does help when they hit assembly language instructions in chapter 3!That's why it's so confusing when you hit the exercises in the back of each chapter. Where did these come from? Very little of it can be answered by reading the book, the teacher of my class was only able to answer the questions due to experience outside of the field. Most of the answers start with ""it depends on . . ."" and the answers really didn't come from anywhere in the book. Most of the questions are trick questions and this isn't a way to teach, but it is a way to confuse the reader. I guess I'm reviewing the book in the same way the book reads. Sorry. And sorry to anyone required to use this text!"
2,obviously not edited well,"First of all, this book is a very dry read; extremely boring. The concepts aren't very clear and the book as a whole is unorganized; the first chapters refer to things in later chapters and makes everything hard to comprehend. The questions in the back of the chapters are difficult to ansewr because the content of the chapters don't help in answering them. In addition, there is a countless amount of spelling errors and numerical errors in the book. And this is the 6th edition of the book!! I expected so much more from this!! It makes me angry that this book is so bad. The cover is nice though if you get the hardcover edition, but i suggest getting the cheaper international edition because there are no color diagrams in the entire book. What a waste of 100 dollars!!"
1,Only good as a sketchy reference for those who already know the material,"This book only seems to cover very high level concepts. Then, the end of the chapters contain problems (that our professor loves to assign) that only vaguely relate to the material discussed in the chapter. Several problems involve numerical calculations using formulas that you simply have to magically form out of thin air. No examples of how to work these problems are given.Also, the book's general explanation of concepts is absolutely horrible. They love to ""explain"" what they are talking about by providing a chart/figure/diagram labeled with numerous acronyms (that are rarely defined very well) that might as well be cave drawings because they describe these complex pictures so vaguely.I despise this book, and because of it, I despise the related class."
1,Over Complicated,This book tries to over-complicate most of its subject matter. Many of its topics are more easily understood by referencing other texts (or even internet references). The end of chapter questions rarely seem to reference material read in the chapter. Rarely can you review an illustration or table that is on the same page that is referencing it. I almost got the impression that the author was trying very hard to display his intelligence by not presenting the material in a manner that could be understood.
1,This Book is very technical in nature.,"This is a very technical book in nature and most people will find it very confusing. Stallings also jumps around when referring to diagrams and figures that a lot of times are on a different page from what one is reading. This book has no pictures, just drawings and diagrams, so I am surprised about the cost of this book. It is defintely not worth the $78.00 it costs. Many of the complicated computer explanations are just way over the head of even the educated reader such as myself. I would not recommend this textbook as a book for a college class. It is like reading the journal entry of someone's thesis to win an award on computer organization and architecture."
2,No Depth,"This book is for someone who has no concept of computer architecture. The book discusses every area quiet vaugely. If you are looking for a book that will help you understand computer architecture then this is not the one. I would recommend you read ""Computer Architecture A Quatitative Approach,"" by Hennessy and Patterson."
1,Who wrote this book?!,This book is very disorganize. The exercise at the end of each chapter has nothing to do with the chapter itself. It almost seems like the exercise came from a different book. I bought it because it's a class requirement.
1,One of the worst texts I have been forced to use.,"I am noticing a pattern with this publisher. Poorly organized text books, that provide little insight, yet take many pages with irrelevant diversions. Rather than present a theoretical basis and build on it with examples, it consists of examples, and unrelated scraps of information, that build to confusion without understanding. One of the worst texts I have been forced to use."
2,Good material - poor presentation,"I'm a college professor and used this book for a class. I wish I could give this book a better rating because it does have more good, current information in it than any other book I've seen. Unfortunately, this information is presented in such a condensed, high-level and (sometimes) incomplete manner that's it's frequently very difficult to understand. The author needs to spend more time explaining the concepts he presents. He needs to give more examples, simpler examples and more detailed examples. There need to be more end of chapter exercises and the exercises need to be less ambiguous and more closely related to the material in the chapter. For a beginning course in computer architecture, this book is too high level. Another downside for using the book is that all of the exercise and test solutions are available on the internet. This essentially renders them useless for assessment."
2,"Decent material, absolutely terrible questions.","This is by far the worst textbook I've had yet in college. The material is more of a broad, vague reference that teaches you the basics of the material. This wouldn't be so bad if the questions were the same way. The questions are the most in depth and ridiculous things I've ever seen in a textbook. They require a deep, grad-student level understanding to answer them correctly. If I were you, I would Google ""Computer Organization and Architecture 7th edition solution manual"" to find a free solution manual. The questions are mostly the same in the 7th edition as they are in the 8th and it helps you to see how useless this book is. Shame on you William Stallings. Don't get this if you don't have to!"
2,Eighth edition - introduces new content (?) and errors,"I'll mirror the less favorable reviews regarding the content in the chapters and the exercises at the end of each. It would be nice to learn enough from the pages in the book to answer them, without having to refer to outside resources that provide much better explanations of the content. If you knew enough to fill in the gaps left in the reading material, for what reason would you still need to buy the book?What bugs me even more is to find all sorts of errors in the book at this price. Yes, writing a book is hard work, but if the proofreaders can't catch a decimal value in a binary field... The first year/first printing of a new edition should be half-priced.At least the publisher should host a wiki to allow these errata contributions rather than waiting for the errata sheet to be released. Maybe Amazon could offer user-submitted errata for books it carries?"
4,A comprehensive book,This book is really comprehensive and up-to-date. It covers the subject in sufficient details with good examples and illustrations. The main problem of the book is that it is too dry and not very easy to read.
2,Difficult to understand,"The concepts are difficult to understand, the book is dry and the information is less than insightful and implementable. My first computer science course required this book and without the professor's assitance I do not believe that I would have fully grasped the main points the book attempted to convey. This is a poor book when it comes to teaching students the basics of computer organization and architecture, and its implementation will require additional sources and teaching."
4,Useful tool for understanding the subject,"I was refered to this text by a professional in the field, and I'm grateful for the help. This text was well organized, and I found it written to a level I could understand without too much difficulty. The use of diagrams and tables made assimilating information quicker and easier than other texts I've tried studying."
1,Boring Book,This book is written using a very sparse manner of exposing ideas. Reading it is a hard and exhaustive task. I can't imagine why would they give it the 1996 TEXTY award. Buy it only if you are required to do so or if you can handle some sort of dynamic reading. Otherwise get something else (there are many other publications on the subject) since this is just a boring and demotivating book.
1,Worst textbook I've ever used,"The editorial review's first sentence is laughable. This book is the farthest thing from ""clear."" The material is not fully explained. Questions at the back of each chapter don't closely relate to the material presented in the chapter. You are left making uneducated guesses as the chapter doesn't educate you on the subject. Variables in equations are not fully explain. Furthermore, examples using real numbers are not presented. I have learned nothing from this book. I hope instructors will stop using this book in their classes."
2,Not a good book,"I followed this book in my undergraduate studies and what I remember very precisely is that I did not like it. William Stallings's way of writing is always dry, i.e., reader does not feel it interesting to read. This is by far the biggest negative aspect of this book. In addition, it is difficult to follow as well.There are far better options there, the best one is Computer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessy."
5,Features 'The Narrow Land' by jack Vance !,"This is a great 60's pulp science fiction collection. As enjoyable as the 80's OMNI gems.Jack Vance is a real-life Yoda as a writer. Along with the Fritz Leiber story the only thing to improve this pulp would be a Cordwainer Smith(he passed on in '66). Yeah, and a Hans Bok or Virgel Finlay cover."
3,"Fine, but nothing out of the ordinary","This CD is simply a good example of competent work by fine musicians, but it does not push any bounds and would not be the CD I would recommend for someone interested in the specific musicians.If you are looking for more of the Liz Carroll sound try the self-titled CD or Lost in the Loop or Lake Effect. You'll get the full range of her style in those CDs"
4,Good CD but More of a Tommy Maguire than a Liz Carroll CD.,I got this item because I'm a fan of Liz Carroll. Upon first listening I was disappointed that the mix accentuates Tommy Maguire--which is fine if you want to hear him and not Liz. To hear Liz you've got to boost up the left channel.
1,The Title Says It All!,"While I was rather disappointed after highly anticipating the release of Surrender to the Air, my faith in the potential for Trey to make a good solo album was more than renewed when his self-titled album came out. It was only a few years ago that I stumbled across a bin containing some of his other solo releases at a music store, most of which I purchased on the spot. I would say that none of them lived up to my hopes, but this one was, as another reviewer mentioned, essentially un-listenable. I understand the rights of an artist to venture into avant-garde musical explorations, but when the groove isn't even there, it tends to lose me. It's especially frustrating when considering so many of Trey's compositions from the early eighties through most of the nineties that were brilliant combinations of creativity, chops, song structure, lyricism, and tonal exploration."
3,Progressivism Failed because buisness elites turned to own,"This book looks at how progressivism changed the whole look of our American history debate. He has masterfully sidestepped several key issues such as how to avoid Sanders tuff grades on contentless material. Overall I would give this valiant effort an E for effort... but in the end, thats all we have here... Look somewhere else for concrete arguments that further American history debates"
3,Jeremy,"Just what I was looking for, very inexpensive and came in the mail very fast as well. It is a entertaining game that works well on my computer."
1,Crappy,These seem to be getting worse and worse. 20% won't record and 1/2 of the ones that do record can't be watched on a Phillips DVD player due to excess skipping. So sad to have a good product turn sour.
1,all Fuji media is problematic,"Thought my DVD recorder on my computer was broken but once I tried media other than Fuji I was fine. Same experience with my Sony camcorder using Fuji Hi-8 media. DO NOT USE FUJI MEDIA. From what I have read the main issue is that Fuji media has ""aging"" problems so you may be OK when you first buy a spindle of DVD-Rs but six months down the road you might have trouble - that was my experience."
4,Good for movies,"I have many of these laying around and my experience with them have been good but there are others brands that are better. I use these to back up my DVDs but I don't use them to back up data as them seem to have a tendency to have errors creep in after a few years of archiving. With movies these disks skip less than others and play well with the late model Playstation and other Sony DVD players. They also don't fair well with multisesssions, so if you are going to be moving information back an forth I from PC to PC I would use other medias (or get a jump drive if you can.)Of course, with DVD-Rs your mileage my vary. I use an ancient Pioneer DVR-105 and these have yet to burn a coaster in it."
2,What do u mean it doesnt roll down?,"This thing fit perfectly EXCEPT on my back....it rolls down my back like sweat.I really wanted to have a full out love affair with the product, but it's so uncomfortable on my upper back that I just cant. If I went up an additional size it'd be too large everywhere else. I like the fact that it's smooth in the front, opposed to my other product which snaps in the front (which allows u to see through tighter fitting clothes).I think I'll focus more on losing these 10 extra lbs in the gym before I focus on finding another good fitting waist control device....I'm glad that many of the others reviewers have found satisfaction in this item, as I have only discovered a black miraclesuite size medium disappointment..."
4,Good control,"Miraclesuit makes a consistently good product. When I buy my next one, however, I'm going to go to size large for the tight control I need."
3,"Tucks in the front, puts it on the sides","So I ordered the XL as I am about a 16/18 pant size, but it's possible I need to go up a size? It doesn't go up quite as high on me as it does on the model; perhaps I have too long a torso.Anyway, this definitely does smooth out my tummy lumps, but I guess it has to go somewhere because now I have a couple nice rolls on either side of me (mostly in the back) under my bust line. Unless I wear a baggy shirt or jacket I feel like it's pretty obvious I'm sporting shape wear. But hey, at least my belly is flatter!"
5,Towards the One,"I am really grateful to Neil Douglas Klotz to have written this book because his translation based on his heart felt mystical point of view allowed me to reconcile myself to Jesus and his teaching. (I was an altar boy who left the catholic church as a teenager). His interpretation shows to the mystic that Jesus teaching is similar in content to all the great teachings of all the great spiritual traditions. The emphasis is on experiencing and manifesting the qualities of being in the spirit of love, harmony and beauty."
5,freedom 5 miles,"These guys are absolutely addicting, especially if you long for something fresh and new. They are completely original but when you listen you feel like you've been listening and lovin' them your whole life. It is hard to describe, but once you hear them, they will be your favorite FOREVER. Check out their website at Americanstandardband.com for more info."
4,Sterling and Aaron have a hit,"This is a darn good recording for those who like Stevie Ray Vaughn type music...Aaron does some excellent guitar work, and I'm going to say flat out that Corey Sterling is the absolute best vocalist in this genre, period. What a voice. Together they do some great work. A couple of the cuts are ordinary, and that is all that pulls the rating down to a four. The first song has some of the best and subtle vocals you'll hear today. I'm hoping Sterling will get a much bigger audience than he has at this point in his career. Amazing."
2,what is this thing?,"This book is totally weird. The pictures have nothing to do withanything. I was not inspired, my mother in law, an accomplishedpainter, saw nothing of interest. Check this book out carefully beforeyou buy it, because it may not be what your looking for"
4,Spectrum Series,"Anybody who is interested in Sci-Fi or Fantasy artwork should be a big fan of this series. Spectrum 1 is actually a reprint of the original. The reason that I won't give it 5 stars is that since this was the first, it's format is that of a directory of illustrators. For an even better experience, pick up books 9-11, they're worth the cost.Panda"
3,Later books are better,"To be fair, I first noticed the Spectrum books at Spectrum 17 and was wowed by the diverse and great art presented. I love these books for inspiration for my writing and Spectrum 17 hit the spot.The first few Spectrums, however, pale in comparision. The pictures are small, often with several crammed onto the same page, and the art itself is a confused collection of random types of art, which is great at showcasing all that's out there, doesn't really maintain an over-arching theme.Maybe that's not fair to these first few books, but if you are looking to buy a book with dazzling fantasy/horror/sci-fi pictures, try the later books in this series."
4,Interesting selection of a variety of art and illustrations,"This could be titled ""The Best in Contemporary Fantasy Illustrations."" Most of the works here illustrations or art for publications (book covers, etc). There are some outstanding pieces here, some genuinely interesting pieces, and a lot of fairly typical pieces.On the whole I think people who are into the art on covers of books, etc. will enjoy this work. I did dock one point because I though that there wasn't a real correlation between the quality of the art and the space it was given though. Maybe later issues are better? I haven't seen them yet."
5,broad spectrum,"I have many of the Spectrum series and love them all. They are all a collection of amazing illustrative and fantasy art. Amazing art, cover to cover."
4,impressed,"this is my first pair of aquatalia shoes. it is extremely comfortable and i got it for a bargain of $30 on amazon. it's great for walking at work. the foot bed comfortably hugs the feet, the sole is durable and the color is perfect with dark outfits. the only bummer is it is velcro loop closure, which over time will loose stability."
1,Book's content was not what was expected,"This book (I should say long brochure), really was not worth the money. Didn't tell you anything you didn't already know.Purchase the book for someone with minimal computer skills, and they were really disappointed."
2,Prepotencia venezolana,"Creo que este libro confirma la prepotencia con que Venezuela ha mirado siempre el tema del diferendo marítimo entre Colombia y Venezuela, ya que basándose en sus superioridad militar, Venezuela desconoce todo tipo de derechos de Colombia sobre la parte del golfo sobre la cual Colombia tiene costas, al punto que sobre aguas que están en litigio, Venezuela no permite la circulación de buques colombianos de ningún tipo, hasta el punto incluso de estar dispuestos a iniciar una guerra contra el hermano país de Colombia como se vió en el tristemente célebre episodio de las corbetas colombianas.Gracias a Dios al final la presión internacional evitó que se activara toda la movilización militar que hizo Venezuela, frente a la actitud mucho más razonable que tomaron nuestros hermanos colombianos."
1,synonym overuse,"I purchased two Tawni O'Dell books, Sister Mine and another; I am a somewhat avid reader and this is my first typed Amazon review. Ms. O'Dell's subject was interesting, however I found her careless use of synonyms irritating. Like a.... As if a... It was as though she finished the story and went back and lengthened it with analogies at every turn. I found it trite and forced. Back to Frank McCourt for me!"
2,Interesting+ well written+ hate the characters= 2 stars only,"I decided to read this book while on vacation, as I had read ""Backroads"" and knew this would probably be a page-turner as well. It didn't disappoint me in that regard, but this book pretty much follows the same scenario of an oppressed male trying to figure himself out. Enough Already! As with Backroads, I disliked every character in this book. The ending was also way too far-fetched."
2,Present Tense,"I know its silly to judge a book by the tense the author chooses, but I can't stand it when authors write in the present tense. It literally sets my teeth on edge.So here's my advice - try it you can deal with the tense choice, but if you are like me, avoid this book at all costs.There is nothing wrong with the plot, the author just needs to get a grip and USE THE PAST TENSE when writing."
4,Good Read,"I had almost given up on another 'Tawni O'Dell' book, so imagine my delight when I found this book on the shelves. Just as I did BackRoads, I read this in one day. You just can't put it down.No need to give a synopsis, other's have done so here, and the jacket cover pretty well gives you an idea of the plotlines. But, if you are looking for a book to get 'lost' in, try this one.Now all I have to do is wait another 5 years for Tawni to write another one!!"
4,I feel like I know these guys,"I commend O'Dell for her ability to portray the ordinary, the poor, and the unexpected sages we all know. While I felt there were some inconsistencies, the characterization was still wholly effective. Val and Ivan stand out the most, but Jess, Bobbie, Jack, Jolene, Eb,and the rest were so lifelike I felt I could turn around and catch a glimpse of them whenever I put the book down.O'Dell is able to instill, and build upon, a sense of dread throughout the chapters of her books that keeps me turning pages even though I don't want the story to end.For over twenty years, I've been collecting quotations from songs and books and films. It's been a while since I've added to my collection, but there are several well-phrased and astute observations in this book which I will be copying into my journals."
5,Amazing Book,This was one of the most amazing books I have studied. Ferguson really talks through the Sermon on the Mount and makes you feel personally connected to and taught by Jesus.
5,AWESOME,AWESOME! It (like all other DBZ videos) is awesome this is an amazing video. It is a must se for any DBZ fan1
1,The worst drawer slides ever,"Having been a cabinetmaker and installing hundreds of drawer slides, I would have to say this is a product that deserves negative stars for a review rating. Regardless of how carefully you size the drawer to the opening, it's impossible to avoid having the rollers catch on the screws used for installation. The result is a traverse that unavoidably clunks and binds.I'm amazed that the company Knape & Vogt (aka ""KV"")would even bring such a product to market, let alone persist in selling such a defective design."
1,Good Concept... If it only would work.,"I thought this was a great purchase for my handspring for those times when I was on the road and wanted to Sync with my laptop computer. Unfortunately, it did not work with my Visor Deluxe and so far I have been unable to understand why.The trouble started when I went to sync and discovered that there was no HotSync button anywhere on the cable. Unable to start the process, I gave up."
5,The Handspring Visor USB HotSync Cable,"I just got the Handspring Deluxe (Ice) and it is absolutely great. I have had it for about 3 days now and I can't get off it. Anyways, I never had alot of room for the big cradle that the handspring came with. So i decided to order this. In my laptop case I could easily fit this in with all my other junk. The cradle took up too much room. This USB Cable is also very easy to hook up. I give this 5 stars because its quick, easy to use, and very portable!"
5,Hot Sync Cable,"This makes swaping files alot easier than with the cradle, because it's more compact, and can fit in your back pocket, i had a cradle, and i got this because i was sick of having to have it in my brief case, now i don't even use the cradle"
4,great to take along when travelling,makes my engagement ring sparkle like it's been professionally cleaned. i take it along with me when i travel. gave it four stars only because i wish it came in an even smaller travel size that i could throw in my handbag w/o adding much bulk.
3,Why Has it Been Cut Sony?,"Only 3 *** because a great British farce has been cut for some reason for this DVD edition by Sony. Compared to the VHS edition from the 90's, the opening scene with the American tourists in Windsor & the Park Keepers scene (with Dereck Guyler,who is still listed in the credits as being in the film)are missing. What I would like Sony to tell me is if the film was OK to release uncut for the VHS release why cut such an innocent film about for its DVD release, about 6-8 minutes are missing.So there you have it, at the moment this is the only version available in DVD form (unless you copy a VHS version to DVD & your not suppose to do that are you?), as I live in the UK our official version is the same as this DVD release(the same cuts)so come on release an uncut version Sony, please!!!"
3,British humor,"It's entertaining, but a little over the top. I liked the play better. Love British humor however. It's good for an evening of relaxation."
5,It arrived lickity Split!,I purchased the product (having remembered it in my younger years) and it arrived two days later in excellent shape. Thanks.
1,Returned Item - heating element not sufficient,"I have a 35 year old West-Bend slow cooker that works better than this one, except the teflon finish is quite worn. Tried to cook a roast and a stew in this new cooker, and after 10 hours it was not quite done. Not happy with product, feel it may have been defective. Heat was not evenly distributed; the pan itself seemed very thin and not of good quality (like an inexpensive light-weight teflon fry pan,that you use a few times and have to discard). Also,it really doesn't have handles; just a slight ""roll-down"" at the 2 sides. Item photo deceiving. Returned a week ago. Waiting for credit on my account. Like West-Bend products; may try another one."
3,mixed bag,"look around cheaper at store then Amazon. By a wide marginHad a problem the first week did not cook well. since then it's been OK. Drys out cholent, add more water. Heard that this is a mixed bag, sometimes works sometimes not. We have been ok with it so far a month and counting. Still not happy Amazon price with shipping over $10 more than local store."
2,crockpot,I replaced the same unit that I bought 15 years ago. The former product was superior. I found the new cooker to be more flimsy and not as well made.
5,Rear window of my SUV,"Well what can I say, wiper blades wear out from time to time, either from lots of use or weather free radicals that are constantly attacking it. It's so nice to come to amazon and look up the Anco 9114 Aero Advantage Wiper Blade - 14"" They have the little drop down chart so that you can find the correct blade for YOUR Vehicle. Anco's Winter Wiper Blade is able to handle everything that Mother Nature can throw at it, specialy when you look in your rear view mirror to see where you've been."
2,Remastering misses the mark.,I have a very discerning ear and I was deflated to say they least when I listened to these releases. I have these both on LP and on the original CD releases. These are defining albums for a solid rock band that went ballad goey in '76 after R.E.O. Typically when you pick up something remastered you expect a cleaner recording with better separation in the sound. These sound flat and very uninspiring for the listener. The LPs still sound the best!sk
5,Reo's First release on CD!!!,"Finally, a record company decided to issue Reo's first release on CD. Reo Speedwagon and REO TWO are some of the best music that this band has recorded and the digital remastering only enhances an already great sound. The liner notes are a good addition as well. May Gary Richrath live on. Get it while you can!!!"
4,"Great roadhouse rock from before they were ""Pop Stars""","Not that there is anything wrong with the REO SPeedwagon music from the 80's,it is good pop, it is just not my big cup of tea as it were.Here in REO's first two LP's(now CD""s), is a much more rock and roll REO, similar to Early E Street Band and Early J. Guiles Band. Sophisticated Lady was my big favorite, but there are many other songs just as good. This is more good memories for me from my High School days, yes I was too young to go clubbing in High School but this education came from my older brother, and I took to it.So here's the deal, if you like the old roadhouse rock from the early 70's you might really like this set. However, if you are from the MTV generation, you may just hate it."
2,So So,"My kitchen is entirely Kitchenaid, so I was very excited when Kitchenaid released their silicone bakeware line. I love the color and the way they clean up very nicely. I also love that they do not get scratched or clank around in my cupboards. However, I have noticed that when I bake in these, I can smell the silicone. It even dominates over the smell of the cake or bread that I am making! I have also noticed (especially with this bread pan) that the silicone gives your dessert a slight silicone taste. I own the muffin pans, so I use paper baking cups to prevent this from happening, but with the loaf pan, there is no way around it."
1,Don't waste your time,"Although product does not stick and you can touch sides without getting burnt, this is so flimsy to use that I just hate it. Would not recommend. Get the real deal!!"
5,If you love Mary Englebreit you will love this scrapbook,"I love to scrapbook and I love Mary Engelbreit designs, if you do too, you will love this scrapbook. Her designs are so warm and whimsical, they put a smile to my face, and here is a perfect place to feature your treasured photos of friends. Guaranteed to your warm your heart and put a smile on your face."
5,Good card,"This is a good little card. Don't know if there is much to rave about, but at least there is nothing to complain about. Very trustworthly card."
4,great for cooking bad for cleaning,"I love this pan for baking 6 mini loaves at a time. They come out great. I have tried putting it in the dishwasher and hand washing it and I couldn't get it clean. It flops too much in the dishwasher. When I hand wash it, it looks clean and then it dries and is still dirty. I still use it anyway."
3,"Great for cooking, not so great for cleanup","I love cooking with this pan. I haven't noticed an unpleasant smell as other reviewers have, it's wonderfully nonstick and all around works great. Overall, I'm thrilled with this pan until I have to wash it. I do not have a dishwasher, so you might not encounter the same problems, but I find it incredibly hard to clean--it stains and if batter burns anywhere, it's pretty much adhered to the surface of the silicone. Using it is a joy but cleanup is a huge chore."
3,"It is mostly nonstick, bakes even & doesn't rust","I have used this pan to bake banana bread with good results. It turned out nicely golden brown and was easy to pop out. I also baked brownies, and that stuck to the pan. I will not bake brownies in it again. I did not grease my pans for all my baking. Since I use it primarily for my banana bread, I am happy with it. If I used it for other more sticky substances such as fudge brownies, maybe you need something else.I didn't have much problem cleaning it by hand. It is a bit too large to fit into the dishwasher unless you put it on the top rack. It will take up the entire space on the top rack.Soak it in water for an hour and then washing works great for me."
1,too floppy,"I was disappointed in this product. I know the silicone bakeware is floppy and assumed the sled would support it, but it didn't. The baking pan slipped right through the sled, curling the sides of the pan up. I resorted to using the baking pan without the sled on a cookie sheet, which worked ok, but again the floppiness of the pan made loaf removal a challenge."
3,Hard to handle,"I like the silicone 6-mini loaf pan itself, but the metal sled/tray that it sits in is not made to properly support the pan. If you lift the tray up after filling the compartments w/batter, the pan falls partly thru the bottom, making it hard to put into the oven. I forego the tray/sled completely and it just sits quietly in the back of a cupboard. I now have to place the loaf pan on a cookie sheet to give proper support to cook evenly. Other than that, it works like a dream. Yes, I do spray the loaf compartments with Pam to make sure the breads don't stick at all. Not the greatest item I have ever bought, but I like having 6 mini loaves finished at one time."
1,Too big,I was disappointed that this wouldn't fit into my convection oven. I would love to have been able to use it.
5,Easy to use,"I had been looking for some time for a mini loaf pan, but had been unable to find one in a conventional material. The silicone mini loaf pan is easy to use, cleans up with no effort. Like my other silicone bakeware, it cooks evenly and things do not tend to burn. The rack is a nice feature as it gives the pan more stability."
2,What??,I purchased this DVD so I could get a better idea of what Alaska has to offer and make decisions on what areas to visit. This is a slideshow with a brief explanation at the end of the DVD. I am no more enlightened by this DVD but my wallet is a little lighter.
5,"A ""Funtastic"" Local Release.","I was totally blown away by Woody Carr's talent and effort on this release. A touch of blues, funk, jazz, soul and let's not forget the local touch of Seattle. Right off the opening track, ""Gett'ed Right"", to ""Metro 85"", which by the way is my fave with it's very local theme, to the closing, funky ""Emergency Blues"", Mr Carr's Granola Daddy is a must have for serious music lovers."
4,Surprising that these are as good as they are!,"For a pair of headphone made of platic and leather; these are nice. The sound is amazing, as well as the bass. The cord is strong, and they fit amazing well. Actually, too well. Over time, the leather will make your ear sweat since they form an airtight type bond on them. But I use them still for my music, and they havent broke yet after 3 months."
1,Poor Quality Wiring Impacts An Otherwise Good Headphone,"In the past two years, I have bought at least 95 of these headphones for school computer labs. Slowly but surely, every one has failed with the most common failure being the small guage and low quality wiring that takes the sound from the input contained within the left headphone case over to the right headphone. The wire is very thin and fails internally after a short time. I have talked with the quality control manager at Califone and even sent him several failed units; they claim there is nothing wrong with the design, yet we all experience the same failure in wiring that renders the right channel inoperable. STAY AWAY FROM THIS Caifone model until they redesign it. All it would take is high guage, heavier wrapped wiring between headphones."
2,OK for a short while then not very comfortable,"Just as reviewers ""Randy"" and ""Josh"" noted, these headphones have passable sound but quickly become uncomfortable.We purchased these for our 13 year old son after another pair was delivered broken, and he tried to use them to listen to Spanish homework and music on his laptop. Within 30 to 45 minutes he began complaining about the same thing those other reviewers noted, that there needs to be a foam pad or something inside the ear cushion areas to stop the hard plastic in there from pushing on the ear ---- which really becomes irritating.Our son tried three or four times, but had the same irritating result each time. Now these headphones are heading to the 'going to charity' pile and we will try to do a better job searching for a third pair."
2,"Below average sound quality,quit working in under a week!","I got these headphones because my tv has a fixed audio out port and i needed headphones with volume control on them.I wasn't overly concerned with sound quality,just wanted a durable set that i wouldn't have to replace every few months.Despite the sturdy look of these they failed to deliver that even.The right speaker quit working after only a few days of minimal use.Pros-Volume control for each earCons-Quit working properly after short period of time-below average sound quality (compared to my $20 sony's)-uncomfortable on ears due to lack of padding on inside of ears-squeezes head due to being to tight (would possibly get better with more use?)"
5,stereo-mono headphones,"I have lost my hearing in one ear. Turning the volume up more on my tv was not an option as it would be too high for others. With regular stereo headphones I would loose part of the conversations, but with the switchable to mono I can hear everything well enough to once again enjoy my tv. I am 68yrs. old and have little else."
5,Nice,These are great. I use them as hearing protection in my shop and have the added benefit of being able to listen to music from my iphone. I can't believe how cheap they are.
1,Fun and Fatal both start the same way,"""WARNING: This product contains chenicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.""This warning is on the harmonica case. It contains mercury, lead and tin. ""Made in China"". Big surprise there, folks. All in all, despite the instrument itself being a truckload of fun, I'd rather not die from playing ""Piano Man"".Pros: Easy to learn, fun to playCons: It causes cancer"
2,It's the Population!,"This book is Hamlet without the Prince. The first and most important thing to understand about Chiapas is the tremendous increase in population it has had in the last fifty years. Yet this book never comes to grips with the question of how people are to live today when they are many times more numerous than fifty years ago, and at that time they barely eked out a living. It's too bad that the INI didn't start out with birth control measures when it started work over 50 years ago. If Collier had had a co-author skilled in demography and economics to supplement his own first hand knowledge of the last fifty years in the Chiapas highlands, this could have been a very rewarding book. But as it stands, particularly in the later chapters, there is too much ""anti-globalony""."
5,Common Threads and the Healing Journey,Common Threads: Stories of Life after Trauma is absolutely riveting. To hear these two brave individuals open up and share their own personal stories of sexual abuse was truly inspirational for me in my own journey towards emotional healing. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is battling or has battled any form of emotional trauma. This could also be a great resource for those who work with or are training to work with survivors of abuse.
3,Common Threads: Stories of Life After Trauma,"I watch a lot of this type of film because I am always looking for training materials for volunteers that work with abused kids. This was not one of my favorite, I was just board."
1,Does not work for March 2007 Daylight Savings Time,"This product does not work as advertised. It does not automatically update itself for Daylight Savings time for March 2007. Emerson's technology is NOT based on the 'Atomic' clock technology, which does update itself based on the low frequency radio transmission signal from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Fort Collins, Colorado. (The NIST sends an accurate time signal across the continental United States)All of our other clocks in our house that were not Emerson's technology did change for Daylight Savings tine on March 2007 based on receiving the low frequency radio transmission from NIST's.Additionally, I have not been able to get any help from Emerson's support line (on-line or by telephone)for a 'fix' for this problem."
1,Does Not Work As Advertised,"The product DID NOT adjust for Daylight Savings Time as advertised. Item was purchased in September 2006, yet it wasn't configured to handle an early DST in March 2007."
2,mixed review,"This product could be an excellent product. QVC carries this product also. The first time i purchased, the digits were missing, so i couldn't see the correct time, when they sent me another, it lasted about 3 years, then the cd player got stuck and stopped playng on the 6th track, so i have to send it back again, and oh yeah, it didn't adjust to daylight savings time like it advertised. You probably don't want to get it unless you want to update every 2 yrs, but i really hate to send it back because the cd plays very well----when it plays!"
4,Helpful,This is a nice resource to have as it offers (in detail) many supplements to try for most common ailments.
4,Great secret!,If you've found this review then you have found a great secret in this band. I have had the pleasure of seeing several live performances and feel that the CD does a great job of portraying the feel of their live performance. You'll love this CD and find yourself going to it again and again.
4,Things I miss...,"After living in Dallas for over three years I had no reservations when given the chance to move outta there, but there are a few things I miss. The food and most of all the Rock Shows. Dallas is overlooked as a music Mecca due to the fact that good ole Austin is down the road. The Hundred Inevitables are one band that my wife and I miss a lot. Great guys, great music. It's the kind of CD that you can play and either relax or get up and rock out. I highly recommend this one!"
4,Good book for basics,I bought this book as a basic reference for my classroom... Students find it easy to understand and interesting. Recommend.
1,too slow,"dont buy it , it looks very small, slim,slick design but data transfer rate is too slow . It is taking more than 10 min to transfer just 400 mb..so not at all worth of buying you need spend atleast couple hours for just 2gb or so .. forget abot 8gb/"
4,Good drive and worth the money,Good performance for a USB drive and great storage space. My only gripes would be the construction (it feels like cheap plastic) and it only has one cap.
5,New Book Dispells Myths,"The new Laser Vision Breakthrough book helped me understand that getting my vision corrected is more complicated than some of the advertising I've seen and heard indicates. Some ads make it seem simple and easy. Since the laser procedure is a medical operation, the more I know about who to pick to do it, the better are my chances of getting a good result. All the laser companies seem to make the same quality and experience claims -- this book helped me understand how to evaluate the claims and make a good decision."
4,Helps to Find Best Qualified Surgeons,"Provides lots of information, a must read if you like being an ""informed consumer""."
2,"Describes the Procedure Well, Downplays the Risks","The book gives a very detailed description of the procedureitself and many details surrounding it which is useful for anyoneconsidering the surgery. Unfortunately this can't make up for the factthat it downplays the risks, dismissing stories of bad outcomes asmostly some type of ""urban legend"". Also the author hasworked for one of the higher priced Laser Eye chains and many of theirstaff are quoted in the book. I felt this displayed a subtle biastowards them..."
5,The Laser Vision Breakthrough is a slam dunk!,"I have read the book and had laser vision correction. I urge anyone considering having this procedure to pick up a copy of this excellent consumer guide. All possible questions you could think of are answered in a clear, concise manner. This book is informative, interesting and easy to understand. My outcome was a success, and I am free from glasses and contacts for the first time since 1974!"
5,"Thorough, Complete","In a world of mass production and commoditization, laser vision correction is at risk for becoming a perceived ""easy"" procedure. This book reminds us that not every ""product"" is for everybody; no matter the public perception. Make no mistake, laser vision correction is a medical procedure that attempts to correct your vision for life. You owe it to yourself to ask many questions; hard questions, before you put your only two eyes under a laser and in the hands of a surgeon. This book not only explores the questions you should ask, the answers you should hear and the things you should look for, but also the incredible successes when laser vision correction is done right. Very informative."
5,Yum!,"These arrived earlier than expected, smell great and are exactly as described. The bag came filled to the top too! I am using these to make scented pillow sachets for Christmas gifts. They're perfect and go quite well with the allspice I also ordered."
3,"Good book to have, but WAY OVERPRICED...","I'm downgrading this book partly because it's overpriced and frankly I wish the drawing style in it were different.It's still a nice book to have and covers some specific timing and staging problems that a lot of other books don't, but it's not the end-all and be-all for animation timing that it gets hyped up to be.I still don't understand why this book was out-of-print for so long in the US and why it's so ridiculously overpriced now. It's really a $15 or $20 book at most, but the publishers are charging $30!"
5,You will learn quickly with this no-frills book,"I have referred to this book for nearly ten years, and it is still my favorite with regards to the fundamentals of creating naturalistic movement.More concise, less self-indulgent, and less bulky than either Richard Williams' ""Animator's Survival Kit"" or Frank and Ollie's ""Illusion of Life"", Whitaker and Halas' ""Timing for Animation"" allowed me to advance in my knowledge of timing charts and the creation of believable, naturalistic movement more efficiently than either of those two venerable books. While I tend to agree with reviewers who question the book's price, the no-nonsense explanations it contains provide a solid base from which an animator can embark upon further exploration without being too tied to a particular guru's insights."
3,"Shipped out week late, but still received it in correct time frame","The book wasn't shipped until a week after it was supposed to be, but it arrived within the correct timeframe. The book was in good condition and it was properly packaged. :P And I received the correct book :D"
2,This book crudely portays Gabrielle's thoughts.,"This book poorly attempts to offer a glimpse into the scrolls of Gabrielle, relating to her insights and feelings about her adventures with Xena. The style in which it is written is unworthy of any bard, especially Gabrielle. Childish and choppy, the text reads more like a rant than a narration. While Gabrielle may babble and ramble on in normal conversation, any scrolls she would have written seriously would have had some form of elegant expression. The only credit to give are a few interesting references to episodes, but not enough to make the book work."
2,"It's a STUPID book, HOWEVER, a must-have for Xenaphiles","Trite, campy, and childish, this book is almost too stupid to read through even once. Nothing new about Xena or any other character is revealed. And although it is told from the point of view of Gabrielle, it is unconvincing. But, I believe that the addition of this book to ones Xena collection is an unfortunate necessity for rabid Xena fans (such as myself) in order to make said collection complete. We can only hope that future books are better written."
1,NOT Reggae,"I sure expected more from this. I mean she was in the I Threes for crying out loud. I was hoping for some old school reggae like Marley made. Big mistake. What was she thinking? Was she trying to do 80's pop music to make some quick cash? Did she really think she could do that with this music? If you happen to listen to the other guy who raved about this album and buy it, listen to the first song's snare drum reggae intro and then skip to the next song and then skip again and again until you get all the way through it, because that's the only reggae you're going to find here. The rest is pure sap. Sorry Judy."
1,Horrible Customer support and scanner quality,"Impossible is the word to describe trying to get in touch with Microtek customer service. Not only is the product extremely unreliable, but customer service and technical support would rather you not call them if you have problems. I have owned two Microtek scanners, both products not supported by the manufacturer"
5,Memory Foam. . .,I am very pleased with the memory foam mattress topper. It is very comfortable and can't imagine sleeping on my bed without it anymore. I was concerned about my sheets fitting over the mattress topper but it hasn't been a problem. I would highly recommend to others thinking about purchasing a memory foam topper. It is very comfortable and you will be happy you purchased it.
5,Another Bargain Through Amazon,"These peppers have good color, aroma, and taste. I ordered a pound and am quite pleased with the amount of product per dollar. We use green peppers for many things: poaching salmon, flavoring corned beef, ground in salads, etc. So far I've found the peppers competitive with any other green peppers I've bought and they are less expensive to boot."
5,"Green peppercorns... great pepper taste without a harsh ""bite""","If you are like me and you tend to limit the pepper on your food because you don't like the ""bite"" of black pepper... try out green peppercorns. They have an awesome flavor that really adds to your plate and yet it doesn't have that bitter edge to it. That being said, I've ordered green peppercorns from a couple of different spice companies and you can't beat the price of these! They have excellent value and quality, and I can't recommend them more!Green peppercorns are especially good on fish, eggs, pasta and other light-bodied foods. I will NEVER go back to black peppercorns again!"
5,Good spice,These green pepper corns have milder flavor than some of the other types and worked great in soups and stews that need the milder flavor
3,package sucks,"Peppercorns are find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor."
1,Free and that is to much.,Never could figure what the book was about so gave up on it. I know its not about the weather. Save your time.
4,Good camera,I bought the XTsi camera 1 year ago. This camera takes excellent pictures for both indoor and outdoor. It has most of the features I need as an amature photographer. The best thing is that the camera body is very light to carry.
5,"Great, practical information","Bell provides thorough coverage of how to successfully use your bicycle as transportation, not a recreational toy--how to get to work, the bank, or church, or to pick up groceries or your kid from sitter, by bike! Bell offers practical, down-to earth advice and information on a wide range of subjects--choosing a bike and accessories, selecting a route, riding in traffic, riding after dark and in bad weather. She speaks from her own experience in New York City as well as other places, and from the erperiences of many other bicycle commuters. She writes knowledgeably about dealing with practicalities you may be worrying about--arriving at work all sweaty, what to wear, safety, and a flat tire! She provides *much* more information for women riders than other writers do."
4,Good overview.,"This book is a good overview of all the necessary considerations for bike commuters. It has some great advice for beginners, as well as some good tips for veterans. Definately required reading for any bike commuter."
3,More Helmet Nonsense,Here is another book on bike commuting and a geat picture of a cyclist with the helmet tipped back. Will they ever get it right? I doubt it! If authors can not get this simple point right please do not expect me to recommend or buy their book(s)!
2,Kensington Speaker,The sound quality of the speaker and the convenience are great. The problem is battery life. I only get a total of 2-3 hours listening time before having to replace the batteries. I find it costly when using alkalines - and inconvenient when using rechargeables.
5,Was Scared to Buy,"After reading several reviews I wondered if it was a mistake to buy this item. would have been a mistake not to buy though. Item is flawless, does just what it is supposed to do. Real handy for me at work as management would go nuts if I tried to walk around with earphones on. AAA would buy again if for some reason I lost it or broke it."
3,Kensington 33388 FX 300 Speakers To Go for MP3 Players,"For something small and easily portable at an affordable price, it OK. It does what I want/need it to do. I did not buy it to fill a room with high quality audio. I bought it for podcasts (for small group outdoor listening) and for recorded bird calls. (The latter to ""call out"" birds for photography.) It's almost loud enough at full volume, but not quite, for the latter task. Battery life at full volume is fair."
1,Only one speaker!,"This thing is not even stereo. It has only one speaker for monotone sound. Also, no bass what-so-ever."
1,Sufism - A Populist Abridgment would be a better title,"This is not ""the essentials"" and it is not worth your time or money. It is more like a journalist giving you a sketchy overview from his point of view. Some basic points are acceptable, such as Sufism not being apart from Islam; however, Sufism is not just an accentuation of Islam, as Sedgwick would have you believe in the first few chapters.He completely dismisses the intellectual founding of Sufism, making it appear that someone as great as ibn Arabi is just impossible to understand and thus not worth the effort. If you are really interested in Sufism why bother with the supposed social, cultural and historical elements that Sedgwick claims. There are better Western authors to read, who have much deeper and correct insights.....If you just want to have the very basics you are better off looking into a dictionary or encyclopedia of religion. At least you will not get the subtle biases of Sedgwick to interfere with a true understanding."
1,A Ripofff,I'll keep this brief. This is one of the worse videos I have seen. Most of the footage is from movies. After watching it I threw it away.
5,Native Universe: Voices of Indian America,"I suppose one could call this a ""coffee table book"". I ordered it to help me in research since I am writing a historical novel about Cherokee Indians. The reporting is excellent and the photographs as well. I found detail about the Cherokees that I hadn't discovered elsewhere. This, of course, covers many Indian tribes across the country. Even if you aren't specifically interested in Indians, I believe you will find the information to be informative and absorbing, if not entertaining. Do you know what Chief Sitting Bull's father's name was? He was called Chief Jumping Bull. Trivia aficionados will find this book loaded with interesting tidbits of information not found anywhere else. I highly recommend it."
1,Very dissatisfied!,I would not recommend this machine to anybody. The problem lies in the minimal amount of output you get for each roll of film.I have spent more than twice what I invested in the machine on the film.This is a classic example of planned obscelescence. They hook you into the product with an attractive price and then commit highway robbery on the price of the refill.Best bet... don't buy it. You are better off spending a little more up front in order to get a better output from your machine.
3,UX-3CR is for Sharp model numbers:,"I bought these rolls of imaging film in June 2003. According to the package, they are for the following Sharp model numbers: UX-300, UX-305, UX-340L, UX-340LM, UX-345L, UX-355L, UX-355LR, UX-460, and UX-465L.Also, just in case it's not clear to you, there are two rolls, 98 feet each, in the package.I agree with other customers here -- this is a pricey way to print faxes. I try to receive and print most on my PC, but my UX-355L is great for sending."
3,Sharp fax machine UX-340L,"Just thought I would let others know that the Ribbon UX-3CRis also compatible for the the Sharp UX-340L. I went throughalot of hassle with the Sharp company to find that out so I thought I would save someone else the trouble. Good luck withyour fax, I hope this helps someone."
2,"Overpriced--That's the fax, ma'am....","The fax machine was reasonably priced & works well, but after buying 3 cartridges, I feel like I bought the fax all over again. In other words, the cartridges are overpriced and it's not even like the inkjet cartridges for which you can purchase ink refill kits. If you want to receive faxes, then you have to buy the expensive cartridges that I am sure didn't give me 100 sheets of print each. Amazon has the best price that I've found so far, but I still think the item is overpriced."
4,acura mdx 2001 air filter,"Product arrived on time. I got it w/ rebate. Installation was more difficult than I had expected. But that was due to difficulty with accessing the filter holder under the hood. Once I was able to get access, it was easy to remove the old and insert the new filter. My MDX is 2001model so I'm not sure if newer models would be easier to access or not. If anyone is planning on doing it yourself it would be good idea to remove the battery first to make it easier to access."
3,IT WILL DO THE JOB.,"ITS NOT OF THE SAME QUALITY AS THE ORIGINAL ONE, BUT IT'LL DO.I GUESS SOMETIMES YOU ""DO"" GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
4,Jones At Home With Hits & Standards,"The Green, Green Grass Of Home CD features songs included on the US album releases Green, Green Grass Of Home and Funny, Familair, Forgotten Feelings. Many of the songs included are remakes of classic country western genre songs, along with a few standards such as ""My Mother's Eyes"". Jones even covers the legendary Johnny Cash with a more rock oriented update of ""ring Of Fire"". Most of the songs tend to the romantic ballad side, although musical arrangements mostly stay true to a more country and less orchestral sound, which was uncommon for Jones in the late 60's. The highlight is the title track, an international smash hit single that gave Jones his second #1 hit in the UK and his first major hit single of consequence in the US after the teen following of ""It's Not Unusual"" and ""What's New Pussycat"" from two years earlier."
1,Worst dealer ever!!,"I ordered a book on March 14 for a birthday present. Today is April 16 and I still have not received the book. I have contacted the dealer twice, but the dealer did not respond to either email. I have also filed a claim because my credit card was charged for the book. If you actually want to buy something at Amazon, do not attempt to buy from Vertex. The worst dealer ever!!Zero stars!"
5,Early Florida Architecture,This book is a fantastic look back at our early Florida roots in the sense of shelter and the first tier of human comfort.
5,Fun to learn with,"My 2 yr old got this for his bday. He loves it. But even better, my husband loves it too, haha."
4,good.,i bought this even though my son is wayyyy to young for it. he likes playing with the knob things. i think it's going to be a great educational toy when he's older. it's made out of wood and heavy duty plastic. very durable.
4,"Well built, but wish maze cards were laminated","Well built, but find that kids have to be guided to it. Older kids play more with it but their attention is not held for periods over 10 min. It is a nice piece though. Littler ones roll it around."
1,Throw in the garbage,"This band stinks! Everything about it is ... how shall I put it.... not cool? From the pansy stupid weakling cover art to the pretentious attitude of ""haha you idiot you paid money for our album"" just makes me want to pile garbage on it and set it on fire to cleanse the universe. It's like pretentious elite indie clannish stupid rock wanting so bad to be like Converge. Just save yourself some time and just get a Converge album."
2,One of (if not the) worst of Shakespeare's plays,"In fact, it's been said that likely didn't write most of it. The production of this play performed at my university is generally considered to be the worst play performed on our stake in the last five years. Plot threads are left untouched, dialogue is uninteresting for the most part, etc. People in the audience either slept, left during the intermission, or pretended they were enjoying themselves. When you are in a play, usually people you run into on campus have something polite to say about the play. The best comment I got was, ""You were OK, but I didn't understand what the play was trying to do with your character."" Pericles does have some good scenes, but they are so scattered that the play isn't worth sitting through to get to them. Only for those who feel a compelling need to read all of Shakespeare's works. Even those may want to avoid it, because it isn't wholly the work of the bard."
5,Amazing!,This book was absolutely amazing! I bought it not expecting much but I received one of the greatest works of writing. I defiantly recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy books.
1,Terrible Product,"I bought this product in my search for a good hardwood floor cleaner.Big waist of money! My floors looked cloudy and streaky after I used it.This product just got spread around my floors, instead of cleaning them.I will have to re-clean the floors just to get all the residue off that was left. I would not recommend this product to anyone for anything. Except maybe a practical joke!"
5,I love this stuff!,"Not sure what the bad reviews are about, but I've been using this stuff for years, love it, and have now turned to online sources since I can't find it at my local stores. I sweep and steam the floor before using it."
1,avoid this at all costs,"This product has ruined the appearance of our new hardwood floors. It leaves behind a hazy film that makes the floors look terrible. The problem is that when you see the haze, you think it needs cleaning so that you use more of this product to try to clean it. We have spent hours trying to get this gunk off our floors and it is backbreaking labor. DON'T BUY IT!"
1,"DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT, IT WILL RUIN AND DAMAGE YOUR BEAUTIFUL FLOORS.","I can NOT stress this enough. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ON YOUR FLOORS. Your floors WILL BE RUINED, without a SHADOW OF A DOUBT.The product when initially used leaves a shiny residue. DON'T BE FOOLED. This residue quickly scratches, leaves scuff marks, and soon turns into a milky white cloud. Your hardwood floors will turn into a dull milky cloudy mess. No amount of scrubbing, soap or water will remove the dull milky residue. This residue is very thick, almost like a polyurethane.Some have suggested using Windex and a buffer. If you try this you will see thick gunky residue come up.You will need to spend thousands refinishing your floors.We are extremely upset. Our hardwood floors cost thousands of dollars and were BRAND NEW, our new beautiful floors are ruined because of this product."
1,Horrible,"This is absolutely the worst product I have used in years! It was applied one time and my hardwood floors looked very nice and shiny,although streaky in some areas- especially corners.However, after I mopped the floors to clean up dog's muddy paws the floors turneda milky gray and had an awful residue with streaks everywhere. My husband and I tried mopping again which only made things worse.We tried using Bona, and many other cleaners with no luck. Finally rented a buff and polish machine to see if we could scrub the residueoff. Nothing seemed to clear up the streaks. After spending our entire weekend in pursuit of cleaning the mess Orange Gloleft behind we finally had to call professional floor cleaners to strip then seal and polish the floors.Absolute nightmare! I have no idea why this product is still being sold."
1,Awful Residue,"Orange Glo makes the floor look good and shiny... initially. A couple of days later, the whole floor clouded over and looks filthy. An investigation led me to believe that the Orange Glo left a residue that now must be removed to make the floors look good again. I do not recommend this product."
1,Cat urine might clean better,I used Method's product on my new hardwood floor until I exhausted the bottle and picked up a bottle of Orange-Glo when I needed a quick touch-up and did not want to online order the harder-to-find natural cleaner. My floor now looks like I a cow licked up a molasses spill in a rush. Such a bad product. I wonder if someone sells one which can remove this glop. Back to Method for me.
2,DO INCONSPICUOUS TEST FIRST,"THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS AMMONIA AND CAN DAMAGE HARDWOOD FLOORING. I have a pre-fab wood floor and this product created a nice shine. This product may be advertised as such but in my opinion, it is not meant to CLEAN your hardwood flooring. Here's how I used it: Vacuum or dust first, then clean the floor with a hardwood floor cleaner such as BONA, then use the Orange Glo - DO NOT SQUIRT ORANGE GLO DIRECTLY ON ANY FLOOR. Apply it (sparingly) to the cloth first, then go over in sections on the wood. This product contains polyurethane and ammonia - it will bring out a nice shine on a prefab floor, BUT IT MAY CAUSE GOOD WOOD TO HAZE OVER IN WHITE BECAUSE AMMONIA STRIPS OFF THE FINISH! USE WITH CAUTION OR YOUR GOOD WOOD FLOORING COULD BE RUINED. Try a test spot first in an inconspicuous location. Whatever you do, take this advice - DO NOT SQUIRT THIS STUFF DIRECTLY ON ANY FLOOR."
1,Terrible residue,"This product is the worst floor cleaner. It leaves a milky white residue that takes multiple cleanings to remove. Try vinegar. It's cheap, safe, and if you don't like the results, there is no ""process"" to remove."
1,The worst floor product EVER!,"I usually don't leave reviews, but this product really is the worst thing to ever put on your floors. We have about 2400 sq. ft. of bamboo floors which originally had a matte finish. My mother wanted her floors to be shiny and we thought this was great. It left the floors very shiny and she was happy, until we noticed that anything spilled on the floor caused a permanent spot. It also seemed to trap residue like dust and pet hair, no matter how carefully you vaccumed or mopped before applying it. I have now spent several weeks on my hands and knees with Windex and a razor blade scraping up this product like celophane. I am now the proud owner of several grocery bags full of useless wax strips. Buyer beware!"
3,Reasonably good guide to taking creative pictures,"Some nice pictures, and reasonable information, but the Kodak Guide to 35mm photography does the job a lot better, with more detail and relevant pictures to demonstrate technical points. The Hedgecoe 'complete' guide probably isn't the best route to learning how to use your new SLR (or compact), nor to use your existing one better, although it might spur your creative thinking. The focus is on the picture rather than how to achieve it. The layout also struck me as a tad old-fashioned, perhaps because it hasn't been updated since 1990."
3,Left Out,I am a beginner and wanted a book to explain what is involved in taking a good picture. I expected a technical manual to explain the corelation of shutter speed and aperture and good detail on lenses. This book seems to touch lightly on those and spends the rest of the time talking about great pictures rather than telling you how to do it. It is not a complete guide to using a SLR camera.
4,John Hedgecoe's Complete Guide to Photography,"Hedgecoe explains the various basic techniques for a beginner in photography. He depicts ""lessons"" that work as examples in broadening the creativity of a photographer on the basic level. The explanations of various angles and use of depth of field help explain the technical aspects and limitations a camera and/or lens. Knowing such things allow the photographer to know how to create the compostion and image they desire. This book is well suited for the curious beginner who prefers a book to hands-on learning."
3,Good Product...at first,"I bought this with the intention of having a medieval dinner party. I decided to by one at first so I could try it out before getting a set. Its heavy and has a good feel to it. Thus far I have used it for water, wine, beer, and even hot tea. I was trying to determine whether I could taste the metal like another reviewer did but I could not detect any chemical or metallic taste. The inside of the goblet is not the smooth ""mirror like"" finish that is on the out. Its actually rather rough on the inside. Overall, it will serve its intended purpose.Update: Since June of 2012 the goblet has developed water spots that will not come off. The finish is really starting to corrode"
2,Loved it at first but...,"I actually bought this to be used as a fancy cup in my bathroom.It's quite attractive and definitely makes a statement. It is supposed to be safe for drinking.Unfortunately, it seems to be getting discolored and even a little flakey at the bottom. Maybe this happened because I also put mouth wash in it. I am still using it but do feel a little unsafe."
2,Not what was expected,"Ordered these for my Mom for Christmas at her request for pewter goblets. I thought these seemed like the right product, but she said they are comparatively light weight and not the right texture. Hoping the folks at Wilton will be able to help me find the right ones."
2,Extra Long?,"The product states ""Extra Long Strap."" Not nearly! The watch may be great, but I don't know because it will not fit on my wrist. Maybe it is long enough for a woman, certainly not for a man."
1,"Longer than the advertised 14""","I had bought one a month prior and thought I would get one for my other arm, which I did, but while the 14"" size was perfect with the first one, when I received the new one tonight even though the packaging had the same model # and I can't find a longer G&F model on Amazon, it is 18"" long and too long for my forearm. I guess I will contact Amazon on my options."
5,Excellent Read,"Bought these for gardening as I kept developing a rash on my arms from the vegetation. With the sleeves, No Problelms and I can now again garden all I like."
5,"OK for what it is, but I find I use all the sheets quickly!",I would be interested to buy a rubber version that I could clean and use again! Is this a possibility?
4,Great product for large areas,I love this product. With cats and dogs in the house it sure comes in handy. Very sticky!! The only negative I have is the new tear lines. I found the previous tear lines easier to use. I would recommend this product to others.
4,Sticky situation-resolved,"We have looked all over for this refill, and finally found a reasonably priced one here.The only thing I was disappointed with was when I used the rapid click checkout button, I was not told the total and shipping charges. I never saw them until the product was delivered. It cost us $[...] and change for a $[...] product.I am an inflation fighter, and firmly believe that my money is better in my pocket than anyone else's. Therefore I won't be buying this refill here anymore, unless I get free shipping. Shame on whoever let that happen.If I do buy here I will certainly expect to buy multiple refills to get free shipping.Would like to see the Lola Rola on My Power Mall also.[...]"
3,Lola,I was disappointed. I am handicapped and I just can't get to work very well. It's hard to find the end so you can rip it and start again. You waste allot of the sticky. Maybe it's my fault. Just something to think about. I'll keep trying.
4,Lola Rola,Love my Lola Rola's. Best thing ever for cat hair. Couldn't get along without them and I understand they are discontinued.
5,Lola Rola the Great,"I love the Lola Rola Sticky Mop. It will pick up all kinds of dirt, lint and hair."
4,Great Product. :) doesn't tear cleanly :( Try evercare speed roller instead.,"This is a great product and it works well overall, but the reviewer who gave it a negative review is right. They do not tear as cleanly as they should.Still, I do highly recommend this product. It is great for cleaning pet hair from furniture and carpet.Update: i would downgrade the lola to 3 stars now that I have used it for awhile and tearing off the sheets is such a pain. I have tried two other sticky rollers. See my thoughts below:1. the tacky vac. **- small, hard to tear.- it does fit a paint roller, so if you have one of those, you don't need to buy anything else.2. evercare speed roller *****- sheets are smaller than the lola rola.- looks like it might fit on a standard paint roller.- these sheets pickup well and are by far the easiest to change.- these are my favorite one. Most Highly recommended.- found these at target.- Buy this one!!!"
1,lola rola sticky mop refill,"While the original lola rola sticky mop worked very well, the paper used on the refills is different - very difficult to pull off used sheets without it ripping in several places along a diagonal line. Would not recommend."
5,Dog Owner's Best Friend,"These refills are used with the reasonably priced Lola Rola mop type implement. It's the best way to quickly pickup dog and pet hair, especially from dark colored area rugs. Might be too costly to use on an entire home's carpeting."
4,if u are a non pagan trying to compromise...,"I am a non pagan trying to incorporate some of the traditions for the husband to be and i found this to be an excellent source. it has several different interfaith ideas that appeal to me. from bits and pieces to full rites, i have found TONS of ideas i love. it includes wording for the officiant to describe the meanings of certain traditions to the family and friends, poems, vows, prayers and more! excellent resource."
3,Great for vows,"The book is great if you are looking for rituals and vows; however it offers little in the way of help for cords, astrological timing and many other aspects that will affect that special day."
4,Coaching for Newbie,"This book came at the right time for us. There was no information in it new to us - we had plenty of data. Still the organization of the book providing organization of a handfasting was very good. The ""calm down and get through it"" attitude was very good. Once again, the organizaiton and the calm approach were worth the price."
4,A lot of useful information,"This book contained a lot of great information about wedding planning, from colors and flowers (with their symbolic meanings) to the ritual. There is a Wiccan slant to the ceremonies (however it does contain material for non-Wiccan, pagans like druids and heathens), but they can easily be modified for your personal wedding. It contains samples of rituals for not just heterosexual legal marriages, but for ""non-traditional"" couples (polyamorous, gay, lesbian, gender-neutral overtones) as well. There are even examples of rituals for couples who want an interfaith wedding (Pagan-Catholic, Pagan-Protestant, Pagan-Jewish, etc.) There is also a ton of poetry and ideas that can be used to write beautiful and meaningful vows."
5,Handfasting Book,"This book has been very helpful,as a high priestess that perfoms handfastings and weddingsthis books offers my couples several options to choose from."
5,Great Wedding Rituals,"Greetings Everyone,This is a great book to get even if you are not pagan. It covers interfaith wedding rituals between pagans and catholics to pagans and islamics and so much more. If you are a inter faith minister then this is a book I recommend that you get it will come in handy believe me.Regards,High Artist NemoCo Founder Of The Reformed Church Of Satan(Where a sense of humor comes first)..."
4,comfortable,"nice top, sleeves just sat a little lower down my arm than my old pair of medline scrubs, but they are like the length of every other brand of scrubs."
4,When you need something cerebral,"The Iguana is not easy bedside reading, to be sure. I picked this up not knowing what it was and was immediately hooked. It took me longer to figure out what I was reading and I'm not sure I understand it all yet, but it made me think. The characters are surely unique. Syntax can bog you down, but I think it's worth the work. I'm eager to read her newest..."
4,Best Low Profile Card for Gaming,"This card is the best low profile Nvidia based card that can be found. This is the only low profile Nvidia card with a 128bit Memory Interface. Its HDMI port is full featured and can be used to power a additional DVI monitor with a (not included) adapter. The DVI to VGA adapter included works well also. For the size the 3D performance is incredible. I recommend this card not only for those who want a card with an additional HDMI/DVI port, but also to anyone that wants to play games on a low profile computer. The only reason it did not get five stars is because is lacks a low profile bracket."
4,keyboard review,"i have not gotten my logitech cordless access duo optical keyboard yet that i ordered but i have searched over the whole web about it! for you who think that you have to get a recharable mouse becuase the recharable mouses last only about 2 days untill you have to recharge it again! the battery ones like this modle last mre then 3 months! so what do you think cost more using the eletricity to recharge one that exspansive then one that runs one battery because you have to buy the charging base or would you rather spend 70 cents on 2 aa batteries. the keyboard batteries last over a year! i do not know about the comfort of this keyboard although it looks very comfortable, once i get my iteam i wil write anther review aslo for thoses who dont think amazon has fast free shipping it does!the day it was shipped from californa i think, it arrived here that same day in connecticut its at the ups place right now...hopefully ill get it today so i can write anther review =)"
5,I Give the Fifth Installment 5 stars,"In Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman Season 5, Dr. Mike finds herself struggling between taking care of her family, her newly born daughter, and her patients at the clinic. As Colleen goes off to College, Dr. Mike thinks about giving up her practice to take care of her baby. This fifth installment has a lot more action and adventure than any other season and an awesome action-packed season finale that will keep you wanting more. This DVD has excellent picture quality and an interactive Menu with summaries of each episode and an option for scene selection. I give the fifth installment five stars."
4,"Dr. Quinn, 5th Season","I am a huge Dr. Quinn fan. I liked the 5th season. With shows where the main characters are in love but it takes them a while to finally get together, a lot of times the show kind of knackers off after the couple becomes an actual couple. Not because of the quality of the show, but people often lose interest after the lovers finally get together (Dr. Mike and Sully). So the fourth season was them as newlyweds and the pregnancy, which was interesting, and the fifth season was show after show of the episodes having to be sort of shocking and sad to remain interesting. But this show did a good job overall, I think. The only episode that I disliked was the finale. In my opinion it was just thrown together with really no good reason why Sully was making such idiotic decisions. But it's spilled milk now, right. I'm waiting on the 6th season, and I'm sure he'll make it through."
3,Good but heavy...,I bought this for my wife as a gift. We have season four which I liked better than season five. Most of the episodes are too dramatic for me. Some will make you cry if sensitive. I like more of the lighthearted ambience of other/previous episodes. Some drama is ok but why not balance it with more funny or romantic undertones!!??? hence the 3 stars
4,Handy Item,Bought this to put in the gas grill and be able to use some flavored wood chips. It worked well but rapidly became rusty and unattractive.
4,very small amount of snow,I love this snow but I thought I was getting a lot more than I did. I bought it for my daughter's preschool class and of course they loved it. Overall it is good I just thought I was getting more for the amount I paid.
3,"Great book, over-priced for an e-book","This is an amazing book. I couldn't find my physical copy (it's only available in hard-copy, as far as I'm aware), so I bought an e-version for my kindle fire. It's a lot cheaper than buying the hard copy, and the book is amazing--a must read. It has changed my life & the lives of many people I know, for the better. But $14.99 for an e-book?? That's just kind of ridiculous."
1,Overrated,"There are several issues I have with this book:--This book should come with a large, bold, underlined disclaimer that it is not for victims of abuse. Only too late in the book does the author make this point. Being abused is not your fault; you are not ""asking"" for it.--This book did not encourage me to improve myself. Instead, I felt like it was almost hopeless to try to improve, because it was so complicated!--Also, this book claims to not fall in the trap of all the ""self-..."" books, however, it is obsessed with ""self-deception"". If it truly was not a ""self-..."" book it would have placed a larger emphasis on losing yourself in service for others, instead of being consumed with reflections on your faults.If you wish to improve yourself without the complication, Gordon B. Hinckley's ""Standing for Something"" actually encourages realistic improvements and makes you feel that you have potential to be a great person."
2,What was I supposed to get out of it,"We got this from set of our parents who said it was one of the best books they read. With that hearty recommendation we jumped in and read in bed in turns (evenings, Sunday afternoons). We talked about the first couple of chapters and were trying to figure out why we were given the book. The more we read the more confused we were and even though we skimmed the rest of the book, we quit after about page 50. I just have to presume that if this book is meant to heal relationships then our relationship as a married couple is pretty good because we had trouble finding application to any of it. Granted, we don't have teenagers yet! To those who read this who have read the book and want to give it as a gift, think twice about what you're conveying when you think of giving it as a gift to someone you love. (They may think you gave it to them because ""they have issues"".)"
1,Awful!,"Basically, his message is, ""You have to be nice and polite to everyone else, but anyone can hurt you however they want, and if you don't let them, you're only hurting yourself."" Why would I want to associate with anyone who has a mindset like that?Don't buy this book. It's not worth your time or money, and the author doesn't deserve it."
1,"If you're in this position, it's all your fault - YEAH RIGHT","And it doesn't matter how many times you've been kicked in the head, unless you're willing to forgive and forget you'll still have a fractured skull. Meanwhile those who are doing the kicking are not at fault if they don't recognize they're hurting you, after all you're only hurting yourself.LIKE HELL."
5,Changed my family relationships forever,"If you have ever felt hurt or ""wronged"" by someone you are close to ie relative, or close friend.... this book will change your life. I never knew the power it would give me to overcome some very deep-felt feelings towards someone with whom I love dearly and was hurt to the ""core"" by them. I am a different person now after having read this book and I would highly recommend it to anyone! It isn't an ""easy read"" and its concepts are detailed and one must truly read it from cover to cover because it builds on previously mentioned case studies as the author points out the most important ways to overcome these situations in relationships. With that being said, I must also tell you it is totally worth reading!!!!!! Take your time and ""digest"" all that it has to say. I have now read this book a few times over, not just once, because of the valuable insight it has given me on so many levels. A must read. A must buy for anyone's shelf."
5,Bonds that make us free,This book is for everyone. It helps you to see how you can become a better person with out making you feel bad about your self. It will create a new way of thinking in you!
5,Bonds...A must read for everyone!,"This book is a must read for all individuals! My family is currently going through a personal crisis which is why it was recommended to me, however, if we all could understand and implement the thought processes written here we would avoid the crisis in our lives! It is all about self betrayal, and we all do it in one way or another, it is human nature, but when you remind yourself of it daily your heart will change to put others first in all that you do, even under the worst of circumstances. Very, very good stuff and a fairly easy read. ( I rarely read more than an article at a time)"
5,One of the best books you could ever read,"Once in a long while, amid the untold millions of merely clever, ingenious, entertaining, new, or unique books the world has written for any of its lesser reasons, you will find one that is piercingly and profoundly true, written only for truth's sake. This is such a book. While simple, it is anything but simplistic. Careful reading combined with honest self-reflection and genuine efforts to be good will not just uncover many important issues, it will uncover THE issue. This book is no new revelation on the nature of man and his morality, but it reasons upon truths the rational will see as self-evident, the religious will recognize from scripture, and the empirically-minded will perceive in the honest assessment own their own experience. Any serious attempt to explain human nature that does not incorporate the truths discussed in this book risks being fundamentally flawed and is assured to be incomplete. I wholeheartedly recommend to you this book."
5,Gaga Over This...,"Why didn't I learn this stuff twenty years ago? ""Bonds"" is spellbinding...right from the preface. Get this line: '...we devise and hang on to our emotioanl problems for a purpose, a purpose more important than our happiness."" Stop right there. I drank in the rest of the book in three readings. I always had this nagging feeling I was resisting happiness, but I had never really ventured inot why. Through riveting stories and prfound assumptions about who we are, Warner gives the most incisive, authentic, grounbreaking treatments of interpersonal and personal choice and change I've ever come across--what a contrast from the popular self-help potions I've read till I thought I had my fill, though I never quite got there..."
5,Life Changer for sure!,"I've only read a handful of books that have not only changed my life for good. The principles I learned in this book have been so impactful in changing my relationships with my children, husband, in-laws, even with my own parents. Besides reading the scriptures, it's got to be one of my standard go to books, that I like to read regularly."
5,Good stuff!,I purchased this to polish silver candelabras and it works with ease and little effort on my part. Just rub it on and wipe it off polishing it as you go. My candelabras look fantastic! I even used it on a gold colored necklace that had tarnished and it worked! I highly recommend.
2,"Great Idea, Lousy Pen","This is a great idea that wasn't developed to its full potential.Pros: You don't have to carry a separate pen around. The back end screws off and reveals a needle that can be used to reset the Visor. It slips into the existing stylus holder on the Visor.Cons: Shorter and lighter than the stock stylus, which was an annoyance both in my hand and in the holder. The writing action (ink and roller) of the pen is horrible! A 49-cent Bic pen writes much better than this. For $14.00 I was expecting something of higher quality. Fortunately I bought this at a local store and was able to return the product the next day.Bottom Line: It isn't nearly worth the $13.95 it costs. Save your money and buy a better pen/stylus combo, or look for Pilot Pen's T3200 pen/stylus (retail $7.99)."
5,Nice pen but a little small,"I recently got my visor pen stylus, and I like it. I use it with the newer version of the handspring belt clip (It's not really different, just a little taper in at the bottom) and it works great. If I am standing around and need a pen I just feel for the stylus and whip it out! My only complaints are, the pen is a little thin but you can't really help that because otherwise it would not fit in the silo, and the reset pin is a little more flimsy than the one in the original stylus that came with my Visor Deluxe. I don't know about the Graphite ones though. I have had previous pen stylus combos, (Pentopia) and this one feels less likely to break than they did. It seems as if they had more brittle plastic. But anyways, if you often find yourself needing a pen but don't have one around and you carry your visor with you places...GET IT!"
2,"Annoying, but useful","OK. It works. That's about all you can say. The back screws off to reveal a flimsy reset pin. To expose the pen, you have to remove a tiny cap. It stores temporarily on the back, but I will probably lose it pretty soon. It's too tiny and black. The pen writes roughly. Good for a quick signature, but not much else."
2,Not a Good Fit,"I thought this was a clever replacement for the plastic stylus that came with my Handspring, however, I replaced this after a few months and bought the rainbow stylus pack. Using the pen was a pain - by the time you unscrewed the top you could have grabbed another pen and written your note. The stylus is weighted oddly, too - it seems to be top heavy. But the worst thing about it was after I put the screen film on my Visor, (to protect from scratching), I had to hit the screen hard with this stylus to register a stroke. There is no such problem with a rainbow stylus - or the original one for that matter."
5,Brilliant,"It is a great design. It not only takes up less space, you don't have to carry the stylus and a pen. It is both in one. I like it."
1,Not worth the ink it writes (sometime) with,"Stylus is flimsier than the one supplied with the visor. The pen, if you can call it that, is much like the pencils they give you at a golf course. A quill would perform better than this does. It seems styli weren't meant to be used to write with."
2,Bait and switch,"I am a paraplegic spinal cord injured adult and I have recently been learning to use leg braces. I needed an extra wide walker with front wheels to accommodate the width of my braces and my ability to move the walker forward. The picture of this walker made me believe that this was the perfect solution, however, don't be fooled. This walker is neither wide enough nor does it have any wheels, as depicted on the picture. It is so tiring and frustrating to be constantly conned and manipulated by these bait and switch techniques that these companies use with there false advertising. Do not be fooled like I was. The picture and description of this product is fake."
5,"If you can learn to write from a book, this is the book.","If it is possible to learn how to write a screenplay from a book, this is that book. Not only is it a good guide to teach writing, but it is also an essential reference. I have it on the lower shelf next to my computer so I can reach it at a moments notice. I am constantly looking things up in it, from formatting to contract minimums to Internet addresses.The book is well organized, well indexed, and easy to read. Even if you know how to write, this book is essential as a ready reference on almost any topic.From start to finish, Blum guides you through the process of writing Movie and TV scripts. A++"
5,Excellent,Roll-O-Puzz lived up to its expectations. I recommend it for everyone who likes to put together puzzles.
4,Amazing Album,"This is an amazing album.Every track likens back to The Biker Blues era of yesterday. I Used to be bad starts off the rompin' and rollin'.I saw this line up at the Winthrop Rythem and Blues Festival. Great album and great show. If you like Rockin blues, this is a must have."
5,Wonderful Book,"I heard about this book from a speaker that came from the Kansas Humanities Council and presented....""Root, root, root, for the home team."" He used this book to tell us about farm and city baseball teams. My brother is a Yankee fan and his hero was Mickey Mantle. I had it sent to him for his birthday. He loves it and his son is reading it now. He was thrilled!"
2,OK - But not great.,"This book was kind of disappointing. It mainly focused on Mickey's years in the Minor Leagues. I was hoping and expecting to read more about Mickey's early life -- in elementary school, Jr. High, High School etc., but there was very little information on this. If you want to know about Mickey in the Minor Leagues this is a good book. If you want to know about his childhood -- not so much."
3,Interesting but annoying errors,"It was interesting to read various author's views and thoughts. Some of them may make you angry, some will have you nodding, and there will be laughter. The title is somewhat misleading as it is more of ""my meditations on what the Tolkein stories did for fantasy fiction"" than any look at the stories themselves or at Middle-Earth. It was MADDENING to have Orcs spelled Ores and to have several other badly done places. I paid for this and I expect more from the editing staff. Poor editing makes me less likely to buy other e-books."
5,Love It,I love This mix!!! Could not drink coffee without it. My grocery quit carrying it. Thank You for the making my day!!
5,Greatest Beverage Ever!!,"I have used this product for years, and I found it offered by Amazon by the case so I ordered one. I should have ordered more because it seems that it is only offered sporadically. Please Amazon, try to stock up because it looks like I am not the only one who buys it!Back to the product. I usually add a measure to a cup of strong coffee and I find that it makes a wonderful drink that way, and the Mocha Latte lasts much longer. I still go through about a container every four or five days so as you can probably surmise I drink a large amount of coffee."
5,Great Coffee!!,"Love it!! Couldn't start my day without it. Also great in the afternoon with cookies, coffeecake, or pastry"
5,It doesnt get any better than this,"as far as music goes, this album is unrivaled. I absolutely reccommend it to anyone who likes reggae, altho i really think its appeal crosses genres."
2,"Same old, same old","I now have purchased about 200 art instruction books and it amazes me at how many just rehash the same old thing (color wheel, red & green makes gray, use round brushes #4,8,12, etc, etc, etc. The first 2/3rds of the book are wasted on this common stuff found in so many previous books. The demonstrations are nice and well explained but that is all I could take out of this book. If your a beginner then you probably will get more out of this book. If you're a more discerning artist, try David Curtis' new book that talks more about the subtleties of painting, like lost and found edges, etc."
3,"great, unless you want the little legs!","I purchased this for my daughter for her 4th B-day. This looked like the best option available. The first board I received had multiple broken ball-legs which are needed to stand correctly. I sent that one back, ordered another one and this one had 2 broken legs, as well. I super-glued the legs back on and hope they stay. My daughter loves the geo board, i would just caution buyers on the quality."
3,Barbie shopping - not a lesson in morals,"Let's get real - anyone particularly worried about a lesson in the influence Barbie has over their daughters shouldn't be letting their daughters play with her at all. Barbie is just Barbie - no moral lessons included. The toy is fun, and just what it's meant to be for the 5-10 year old age group for which it was intended. Kids get a kick out of the shopping experience for Barbie. Enjoy it - kids are only young once, just like we were!"
3,"It's cute and a great concept, but keeps falling apart!","I got this for DD. I think it's a great idea (could care less about ""teaching bad spending habits"" she is 5 and it's pretend play).Anyway, the thing keeps falling apart. It's not very sturdy. The top falls off and the pieces that hold the clothes fall off. I plan on trying some super glue to see if that helps.My DD does like it and will like it better when it stays together.All in all, ok toy if you get some super glue too! LOL"
1,Completely Useless Right Out Of The Box!,"The minute I started taking this out of the box, pieces started falling off! They were clear plastic 'tags' that hang on the carousel and were impossible to find in a carpet once they dropped. The thing looks assembled but is actually in quite a few pieces and needs to be assembled. I tried and tried but could not get this to work - all those loose pieces made it rickety and unstable. This ended up being a pointless effort in frustration and, to add insult to injury, I'd find those little plastic pieces days later by stepping on them painfully.This was never used once. I didn't even like the outfits it came with. Certainly not for a child under the age of 10 since it is so rickety."
1,Don't waste your money,"My 5 year old saw this in the store and asked for it last Christmas. I had read the negative reviews, but when it was placed on sale I bought it anyway. I figured the shopping thing with the card would not work, but I figured it would be worth the money I paid if she were able to play with the clothes it came with. Wrong! Not sure what Barbie those clothes are supposed to fit. They did not fit any of my daughters barbies, only one shirt or skirt (can't remember which) was usable, the rest were way too small and useless. We even tried them on Bratz dolls too, but they did not fit the Bratz dolls properly. This was a toy that ended up in the garbage the first time I went through her toys after Christmas. I threw the whole thing away, that's how bad it is. My daughter never asked for it."
1,Quite Possibly the Worst [Quality] Toy Ever,"This is quite possibly the worst quality toy ever. None of the parts fit correctly nor will they stay connected (without glue). Once you successfully get it together, don't dare touch it because it will all fall apart. Very few of the Barbie clothes will fit on the hangars (when you can get them to stay on thier respective hooks). My 4yo daughter was so excited when she opened this for Christmas. Daddy thought he had done good. 15 minutes later, she was in tears because she simply couldn't play with it without if falling apart. Simply a ripoff."
2,More trouble than it's worth,"I bought this for my daughter's 6th birthday. She and her 9 year old sister had been asking for it for quite a while. It is absolutely impossible for the 6 year old to set up and even the 9 year old needs help. The clothes don't fit well on their ""hangers"" and then they are nearly impossible to get into their slots. Once you spin the carousel they fall off. The credit card seems to be teaching them that if they spend all their money, they can just reload more. It's an endless supply of cash. If only the real world worked like that. I am normally a pretty big fan of Barbie toys, but not this one."
5,Amazing projector!,Mitsubishi HD1000U High Definition 720p DLP Home Theater ProjectorThis projector worth every penny for the picture quality you get. Highly recommended!
5,AMAZING RESOLUTION,"Mitsubishi HD1000U High Definition 720p DLP Home Theater ProjectorYes, you can pay $3,000 and more for a DVD HD projector for your home movie theater. But, why? This moderately priced projector has great bright throw (see it in sun-filled room) and satisfying definition with settings for different screen aspect ratios. Easy to set up and connect to program source, DVD or TV or tape. Handsome package, too. Compact and neat. Enjoy."
5,Great,"I just got the projector last night and had it setup in a flash! The color out of the box was excellent and I found the controls easy to use. I did find it for $899 with free shipping on another site when amazon still had it out of stock.I watched a little bit of Emeril's, the latest episode of Studio 60 and about half of the second Pirates of the Caribbean.The standard def picture from dish network dvr had minor artifacts in dark scenes but otherwise looked great. The standard dvd of Pirates was superb on component cables, bright and crisp. From other projectors I have used I was most impressed.I do not find the remote back lighting dim like some other reviews on different sites have stated...So far I am very happy, I will try to update the review in a few weeks!*****2/20/07 So I finally upgraded to HD cable and I am absolutely blown away at the image quality... The colors are amazing and the picture so clear you could be looking outside. I was happy before but now I am ecstatic..."
5,Great product for the money,I have had this projector for about a month now and I love it. It has a great picture even on my painted wall. It is very quiet and is very easy to setup. I have Planet Earth on blue ray that I have been watching and it is amaizing through this projector.
3,Get the new one!,"I am the lead installer for a company that installs RealHomeTheaters, so hopefully my experience can be of some help.This is last years model. The newest version is the HC1500. The new model has a few up-grades vs. this one.1. Brighter ( 100 more lumens)2. More Contrast ( 2500:1 vs. 2000:1)3. Price Drop (until everyone decides to blow these out)Hope this helps get your RealHomeTheaters off the ground!"
3,Promising story ruined by shrewish heroine...,"This romance started out very funny and promising (loved the scene in the stable with the estate agent), but was ruined by a TSTL heroine who is actually supposed to be very intelligent. The hero, Donovan was wonderful and well-written, but the heroine, Corisande was poorly written. I guess the reader is supposed to like her because she's so saintly, with all her good deeds for the tinners and their families, but IMO she behaved like a stupid little girl. She was so over the top shrewish and itchy, it was totally ridiculous. Had Donovan given her a reason, I could understand (some) of her behavior. But he proved himself over and over and gave her no reason to act the way she did. Corisande distrusted Donovan and everything he did and was so self-righteous and smug about it that I just wanted Donovan to walk away from her. She didn't deserve Donovan and this was one of the few times I wanted the romance not to work out in the end."
2,Horrible...Truly Horrible...Heroine!!!,"Wish I had listened to the readers who advised against the book. The heroine was such a Queen B**** that it was painful to read this book. The hero called the heroine a SHREW, and no word could have better described her. I kept skipping through the pages hoping that the heroine's behavior would get better...but was sorely disappointed. The hero should have dropped her a** like a hot potato and stormed out of her life for good. That would have maybe taught her to be kind. Actually, I agree that the hero would have been better off with the heroine's best friend...too bad the best friend was not around. No man in his right mind could have fallen in love with that total b****. He must be a total idiot!!!"
2,It sounded promising...,"I really wanted to like this book and I probably would have if Corisande Easton had not been such an unpleasant heroine. She was a miserable character and I kept hoping she'd change. If she did, it wasn't quickly enough for me. I put it down about three-quarters of the way through."
3,Really wanted to rate it higher,"I adored the hero in this story. It probably could have gotten a five star review had it not been for the mean and nasty little bi@#h heroine. I kept reading, thinking she would surely change her ways or shut her mouth, even just a little, but no such luck.Even after her best friend gave her some very good reasons to change her mind about the hero, it didn't slow her down.I thought the author did a great job of describing conditions in the mines during that time period. It was not uncommon for workers to be treated as described. I had a difficult time believing the daughter of a parson would treat people the way she did to try and get her way. I'll be looking for more from this author just to see if all her h/h are like this."
3,This book could have been great,"This book could have been great, unfortunately is not - maybe the author could work on the behavior of the heroine as the repeated bad attitude just got to much."
2,Not the type of romance novel I like,"Really took me ages to get into the book, then I persisted thinking things would get better as I neared the middle of the story no such luck... gave up shortly after!"
4,Secrets of midnight,"It was a great love story, but if was also suspenseful. It was well written and I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a love story with a twist"
3,Good read,"I enjoyed this book. The hero basically picks the first country woman he meets to be his wife to satisfy the requirements of his father’s will. I liked the heroine, as she was strong and caring for others in the neighborhood. I think the author could have spent a little more time on the story of the hero’s daughter as well as his brother’s relationship with his wife, but overall, I would recommend this novel."
4,Loved it,"Overall ,this was a wonderful and highly entertaining story. Loved the small twists and turns. The main reason I didn't give this book a five star rating is due to the main heroine's mention of the hero being a ""Don Juan"". I'm fairly certain that term had not been used widely during this time period. Nothing wrong with calling the gentleman a rake, or rakehell or any other term that was used during that time. Other than that misstep, I really enjoyed this book. Really learning to love this author."
4,Enjoyed the book,"This was a really good book. As I read some of the other reviews I can understand why some readers had a hard time with Cori, because I had some of those same concerns. Instead of being selfless she was selfish, but that was only when it came to Donovan. Around Donovan she became this whole other person that the others in Cornwall new nothing about. The afraid, the hurt, the weak, Cori. I could relate to Cori after being through so much and carrying so much on her shoulders and mind, it would be enough to drive any woman mad. O highly recommend this book. Just stick with it!!"
3,3 1/2 STARS,"I liked it. I, like others had trouble with the negative attitude of the heroine, but later in the story I believed her attitude had to do with her own insecurities. Still I don't know too many guys who would deal with it the way the hero did. But, other than that it was a good story."
3,THEY ARE OK!,"These cake pans are ok, the are very flimzy, they also have a odor to them when you are cooking with them.."
4,"It's Fantastic Reading, and a Work Out, too!","I received this wonderful book for Christmas, and have made it my goal to read the entire thing in the year 2000 (At 750+ pages). So far I'm on page 130 (it still January) and I find the writing style engrossing, the reference to Vincent's writing fascinating, and the reprints of his paintings vivid (you can see the brush strokes).The only thing I'm not too crazy about is how incredibly HEAVY the book is. This is not your curl-up-on-the-couch read...it's more like put on your gym clothes and prepare for a workout every time you pick the thing up! ENJOY it, great read. Angela2000"
5,A point of clarification on Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,"Two vastly different volumes exist entitled Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings by Walther/Metzger and Taschen publishing. The 1997 volume - recommended by L.A. County Museum of Art - is a remarkable book with an expertly written bio, thoughtful layout and perfect color reproductions. The 1993 volume exhibits awful, colorless prints and should be recalled as it serves only to confuse the buyer and discourage the purchase of the 1997 volume, a work of art in itself."
4,"Not perfect, but good enough already","I would say it is a good book... entire collection of Van Gogh, quite informative and good image quality. Yes, the color is not accurate, but it is almost impossible to print the paintings having exactly the same color as the original. I have the Van Gogh Highlights Screensaver produced by Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam and I don't think the coloring in the book is that terrible as some ppl say(assuming that the color of the electronic copies from the Museum in Amsterdam is close to the original). What I really don't like about this book is.. some paintings were printed across 2 pages. I perfer images are printed in a redused size rather than spanning across pages.All in all, would I recommand this book? YES i would."
2,too expensive,There is only about half the charcoal in each little packet compared to the ones I last bought from Sears (I am using them for a Sears distiller) so I have to use two of them each time which makes them awful expensive for what you get.
1,We do not like the color of his headpiece!!,"In Arabic, Jihad means ""strive"" or ""struggle"". Jihad appears frequently in the Qur'an and common usage as the idiomatic expression ""we are pissed about something"""
1,60 Minute: State of Denmark,Thanks for providing me the opportunity to review this dirty product thant carries no substance. Its just a farce showing 60 Minutes in bold and documentary is no more than 7 minutes. Its nothing else than minting money by deceit. your product doesn't even deserve to be rated '1 star' but I can't find any other option in your drop down bar to give it the rating it really deserves. Nonsense!
3,A good read...,"A few months ago I bought The Vanishing Man. It was the first one I'd read in this series. It was written in the early 1900s and started out very slow. It got better and ended strongly. This book had me hooked from the first chapter and was a good story throughout. It begins to drag things out near the end, but I was pleased overall. It is follows a Watson and Holmes theme but doesn't always keep things moving as well as I'm accustomed to."
3,Interesting but ...,This book was at first interesting because it was written in the early 1900's and uses a highly refined writing style. The reader is always one step ahead of the detectives solving the case and while this is at first interesting it soon becomes redundant. This is the first of a series that had been reproduced in pocket book form. I don't think I'll read any more of them.
4,"If you like methodical process, you'll love this.","You'll figure out the ""who done it"" early on, the the how will take longer. The facts are laid out logically without any real twists. But the real fun with this book is the method and the prose. A good read."
4,"A Good Read, but, not one of Freeman's Best","I rate this one four stars. The mystery isn't all that mysterious, and, I'll warrant the average reader will have deduced the end by the time they get half way through. None the less, this is a Dr. Thorndyke novel, and fans of his exploits should enjoy this story. It's available for free on Kindle, so, if you have a Kindle, might as well download this one and read it."
3,The Mystery of 31 New Inn,It was kind of hard to follow at times. I don't think I would recommend it to others. Took me a long time to finish it.
3,Doesn't quite hold up,"There were plenty of good parts to this mystery, but it really doesn't hold up. Whether that's because the plotting itself wasn't so hot, or because it is from another era, I'm not sure. I'd put this one lower on your list of books to read."
3,"Worth the read, though tedious at times","I enjoyed this one, overall, though I think the first half was more intriguing than the rest. Some of the explanation of methods had even my patient eyes glazing over. And I agree with other reviewers that it was painful to be so ahead of the (at times, impossibly dense) narrator with regard to the action and plot.However, if I came across another mystery with the same two main charachters, I'd surely read it - and hope the side-kick character wised up a bit."
2,not my type of detective novel,"R Austin Freeman's Dr Thorndyke is reminiscent of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes or Rex Stout's protaganist whose name I can't think of right now. Personaly, I don't enjoy this type of detective novel- very very little action, more sitting around thinking and linking impossible pieces together. The way the pretentious Dr Thorndyke links the extremely random clues and pieces together is really ridiculous. I can see how others might enjoy this, but it's just not my type of detective novel."
2,A Sherlock knock-off,"Basically it's a detecting doctor/lawyer, who is oddly fond of the protagonist, but he's affable, so that's not a complete rip-off from Doyle. I couldn't finish it."
5,Blown away!,"This recording absolutely takes you into the heart of an incredible performance by Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony. There is no seat in the house that could possibly deliver the clarity and presence that this superbly recorded Blu-Ray disc provides. Delivered in a charming and delightful manner, I learned more about the background of Berlioz and the writing of this Symphony than I had ever known before. What an intimate and fulfilling musical experience! The bonus video of the making of this recording was also an informative delight."
5,Simply Fantastique!,"This Blu-ray concert DVD is indeed wonderful, fully meeting my expectations in terms of sound, picture and production. The background featurette is not as well done as I had hoped, feeling somehow amateurish. Still, it's nice to have, but the real treat, as it should be, is the concert itself."
3,Confusing Menus,"This DVD has two sections, one, a spoken overview of the music. Tilson Thomas is an amiable and well-informed guide, but how many times are you going to want to listen to him talk about the music, as opposed to simply watch and listen to (watchen) the performance? So the performance option should be the very easy default choice in the menu system, right? If you can figure out how to make it do that, you let me know.A pleasant, edifying performance, of which I wish there were far more; Blu-ray is a wonderful medium for classical performance, but there are far too few to choose from.Sound is good, but a little mushy and muted in the high end, compared to some of the German productions I've watchened. Also, SFS isn't quite the Berlin Philharmonic, either. All told, though, a very pleasant addition to the library, especially if they would make the menu more straightforward to navigate. If you're desperate to skip the introduction, start at track 21."
2,PROBLEMS,"I PURCHASED THIS CAMERA LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. TO MY AMAZEMENT I FOUND THAT IT WAS MANUFACTURED IN MALAYSIA...NOT IN JAPAN AS ARE MOST MINOLTA PRODUCTS. I FIRST NOTICED THAT THE IMAGES WERE NOT AS SHARP AS I WOULD EXPECT. THE FLASH IS VERY LIMITED...ONLY ABOUT 8' MAX. THE AUTO FOCUS IS NEARLY USELESS AT EXTREMELY CLOSE RANGES...I HAVE TO TURN IT OFF. THE CAMERA SUDDENLY STOPED WORKING [THE FIRST ROLL OF FILM] ON AN A MUCH ANTICIPATED TRIP TO AFRICA. UPON MY RETURN TO THE US I SENT IT IN FOR REPAIR TO MINOLTA'S WEST COAST FACILITY. THE CAMERA WAS RETURNED UNREPAIRED AND IS STILL IN FOR SERVICE. IF THE CAMERA LOOKS LIKE THE SIMILAR CANON AND NIKON...IT IS. APPARENTLY, ALL THESE CAMERAS ARE MADE IN THE SAME FACTORY IN MALAYSIA. IN MY OPINION, MINOLTA SHOULD PACK UP AND START MAKING THEIR CAMERAS IN JAPAN WHERE THERE IS MORE QUALITY CONTROL."
5,Would buy only these from now on...,"I have two of these and they work great. I use one for my desktop and another for my laptop. I previously purchased a linksys 4 hub port and it was crap compared to this hub. I enjoy the two ports on top the most...very easy accessibility. If my need for more ports grows, I'll be coming back to amazon to purchase this hub."
1,"Died in two weeks, avoid at all costs","I bought one of these brand new and it only lasted 2 weeks. None of the USB devices are recognized anymore by Windows when I plug them into the hub. The devices work when directly connected to the PC. I also tried the hub on a different PC with same results.When it still worked, I noticed that the hub ran hot but thought it normal. This is my second Belkin hub that died a premature death."
1,"GREAT, until it DIED IN 6 MONTHS","I really liked this hub, especially for the top-loading feature. However, my hub died after 6-months of use. Ugh. I can't risk losing another hub (and the cash along with it). Shame on Belkin for putting out product that has such a short lifespan. Its only a freaking hub, how could it fail?!? No more Belkin for me, unless I see overwhelming evidence that their products are made to last."
1,Horrible performance,"This hub is possibly the worst USB hub I have ever used- it loses connection when placed vertically as well as the fact that it seems to work completely sporadically. I definitely would discourage any would-be buyers from this item. Strangely, all the other Belkin equipment I use works swimmingly- perhaps this is simply an anomaly in their lineup."
1,belkins usb2 hub,"I bought this hub recently and the driver thru windows XP is incompatible and crashes my pc.I wrote to Belkin for updated driver and their reply was that they do not supply drivers and I have to look somewhere else for it.It is ok to buy a Belkin pda case or charger but do not ever buy any electronic component by Belkin,technical support does not exist and you are stuck with a bad piece of junk."
1,Crashed my Windows XP Pro,"It would have fit my needs perfectly, especially since I just got an Ipod shuffle, which I could charge and update by plugging in one of the top two ports. But one day my computer, which is running windows XP Pro, wouldn't re-boot until I unplugged it! Then I had to re-install XP Pro, etc. No fun.The owners manual says ""The Belkin USB 2.0 driver suppports all competitive cards based on the NEC host controller with the exception of Adaptec. The most recent Belkin driver is available at www.belkin.com"" I could be wrong but I think the Adaptec controller is very common. And there are no drivers (or faq) available at the Belkin website, just the owners manual. Based on my and other experiences reviewed here, save yourself and do not buy this hub if you are running XP Pro."
2,Lasted 18 months,"Worked well for 18 months and then failed. Short working life seems to be common with Belkin products. Reading reviews of other brands of hubs, none seem to be great so, despite reservations, I may just buy another of these."
5,A well-designed hub,"I have a couple of these - 7 ports seems to be necessary now that so many devices connect with USB.Pro's:1) the hub gives easy access to a couple ports. For some reason that feature is incredibly hard to find, and I have several devices that travel, so the accessibility is nice.2) it works well - no problems.Con's:1) not that this is much of a drawback, but the hub does get pretty hot, especially if you stack them.As far as the previous comment about the LEDs all lighting up at power-on - apparently Belkin have changed this. My first unit has all the LEDs lit even if nothing's plugged in, and my newer unit behaves like most people would expect."
1,"Seven Hubs, All Have Failed","Initial product performance was fine, but after about 6 months all hubs failed. Belkin Tech Support says the power adapters are incompatible with my $500 UPS and that they need to be individually coinnected to wall receptacles. To me, that constitutes a product defect and represents wholly unacceptable product performance. Nothing in the promotional literature or specifications says that hubs need to be directly connected to wall receptacles.I am in discussions with Belkin trying to resolve the matter satisfactorily and will report back how they respond."
5,Love,these headphones are cute and appealing to my two year old. I was sckeptical to buy them because i didn't think he would wear them. He loves them and keeps peace in the car.
4,cute,"Bought a different animal for each of my kids and my sisters kids. I love that they cant turn sound up too high. Kids like the animals. Dad likes the silence, LOL!"
3,Bought this for my 3yo,"My son was super excited when he got these in the mail, but after wearing them a little while he complained that they hurt his ears. The rubber on the inside is just a little too big for his ears. I did have some extra adult earphones, which I took the pads off and stuffed them into the center of his and that kept him happy. A few times he complained that they were too quiet and that was with the volume controls all the way up."
1,Broke in 3 days,"These headphones are cute and worked well at first, then the cord broke apart at the section of wiring where the volume control is.Unless you have children who sit perfectly still all the time and never turn their heads to stress that area of the wire, do not buy these."
4,"Pretty good, but volume sometimes isn't loud enough","I bought these for our 1 1/2 year old daughter and was thrilled that they actually fit her head! We were going to use them for airplane rides, but she only leaves them on for about 15 minutes, so we just end up using our DVD player without headphones and turn the volume down. The last trip we took I had a problem with the sound not coming out loud enough in these headphones. I tried the switch on the cord and the volume was up all the way on it and on the player. Different headphones worked fine, so I'm assuming the problem was with these. I was going to throw them out, but on our return trip they were working again."
3,"Cute, works, not really toddler-friendly","We bought these headphones for a few plane rides we knew we'd be taking over the past few months. They're really cute and seem to work well. The only trouble is, my toddler (at 20 months) won't keep them on for more than 5 minutes! I don't know if they're uncomfortable or he just doesn't like the feeling of his ears being covered, but he wouldn't wear them for very long. But they do extend, so maybe when he's a little bit older, they'll serve their purpose better."
4,so cute,I simply love them and so does my soon to be 4yr old. There's only one complaint. He says they hurt his ears. Maybe they need a lil more padding or bigger holes? Idk. Other then that they're Great!
5,Excellent product Highly Recommend,Works very well with young kids. I purchased this headset for my 4 year old daughter for her Apple ipod shuffle and it works wonderful. It has a volume control button and it is comfortable for her to wear and listen to her music.
5,Too cute!,"I was buying the teddy bear versions for my 3 year old & decided to also pick these out for my 5 year old who also needed headphones to use with his Leap Pad. The only downside is they are not gonna fold up to be more compact for storage. That wasn't really a concern for me though, as my little ones have small backpacks that are very capable of holding these. They are adorable, work as expected & the price was right. Not much more to say."
2,Volume Control is unreliable,These headphones only seem to work half of the time. I am using it with a Google Nexus and when playing movies for my son the volume only works half of the time. I have messed with both volume controls and no luck.
5,Great,Nice headphones for a 3 year old that wants to be like his siblings with his own headphones. Fit his head well and easy to take on and off.
1,Very low quality headphones,The headphones are of very poor quality. They stopped working after 10 minutes of usage. Wouldn't recommend to buy this product to anyone.
4,cute for toddlers,They are just the right size for toddlers though I'm sure they fit young kids as well. They look to be sturdy as well. Cute design.Great for travelling.
1,broke in about a week!,"we bought these for our 3 year old son, and the poor quality of the wiring broke in about a week. If your child is active, i don't suggest buying these at all! don't waste the money!!"
5,Love These!!,"We just ordered these for our 2 year old son and we love them, and more importantly he loves them! They are light weight, cute, they fit his head great, and the sound is really good. We travel a lot and are so glad to finally find headphones that he likes to wear and we don't have to worry about the sound being too loud for his ears. The cushion makes them comfortable and helps block out background noise so the volume doesn't have to be blaring to hear a video. We're trying them on our next flight this week. If I change my mind about them I'll write an update afterward."
4,Cute headphones,"This are cute! They did not have the ones we wanted at purchase time, so I settled for the Panda vs the Tiger. My son loved them, and we got a lot of attention on plane trips. Only thing was that one ear came off in our backpack, and we glued it back on. Would buy them again. Sound is fine too."
4,Headphones,Prompt shipment and receipt. Price was great. Headphones work well with young children. The animal theme is cute.
2,cute but noisy,"I bought those headphones for my 3y old as we had a 16 hours flight to survive... they didn't help at all, they fit well and are really cute, you can change volume on them directly so your kid can do it himself and size is adjustable, it fitted me too very well and I think they would be great for home use, but then we don't use headphones at home...the problem we had is that airplanes are noisy, and you know how some headphone have a noise-reduction technology? well, those one have the noise-amplifier one, even if you listen to nothing but put them on your ears in a noisy environment, the noise gets 5 times worse, so that, plus trying to listen to something, it's just a shortcut for a headache...I'm very sad they didn't work out for plane travel because they're comfy and so cute..."
3,"Style, but not a lot of substance","I got these headphones for my son, who loves tigers. The price was low, so I wasn't expecting much. Turns out my expectations where exactly where they needed to be. My son used them for about a week when one of the speakers stopped working. We popped open the earpiece (very easy to do, fortunately) and found that one of the solder points had come loose. Not having the tools to fix it, we tried our best with electrical tape. This sorta works, but the speaker still comes and goes. I know it would be a super easy fix with the right tools, but they just aren't worth the hassle. Too bad, because the headphones are very cute."
1,bad headphones,I thought they would work for our 2 year old son. It was cute and he like it when he saw it. He kept pulling them off. after 15 min of listing the sound from the left earphone was gone. needless to say we sent it back. Do not buy this I item. we bought 2 JLab JBuddies Kids Volume Limiting Headphones and they sound great and work great plus i like the limiting volume and did not break after a 15 minutes and the kids keep them on.
5,Fits the Bill,We use the headphones while travelling and some other miscellaneous times. They've always worked great and our son loves the design.
4,A look back at King and Barker,"What is interesting about this book, is seeing how the subjects felt about certain projects while they were in the making. Using the benefit of hindsight, the reader has already seen the movie or read the book - and has formulated an opinion on the quality of the project. ""Maximum Overdrive"" was not one of King's better endeavors, so it's interesting to read about what went into that particular film. It made me a more forgiving viewer, as I could say ""oh, so THAT'S what he was trying to do!"" I also watched ""Nightbreed"" from a different perspective as well. Knowing some of the inside information, added depth to the viewing experience.This is definately a book from a fan's perspective, particularly in the case of Barker; however, despite the lack of critical analysis, I found this book to be an enjoyable collection of interviews and experiences."
5,Easy to Use and Accurate,"I have a Samsung SCH i830 phone running the Microsoft Pocket PC operating system. I plugged in the SD card and the software installed without a hitch. The TomTom software is easy to use and the tracking and mapping with the GPS is excellent! The one interesting thing, but not any issue, is that the software, having come from the UK, uses terms like ""motorway"" as opposed to highway. The company also provide interesting add-ons such as voices, weather and traffic ... but I haven't tried them since the base system was robust enough for my needs. I would recommend this product for any PDA-type cell phone that is supported."
2,urban flex,I was hoping for some better remixes of this track. They are still pretty good. I like the bonus trax alot.
2,"Had to stop watching, not very good","Skip this one. You have got to be kidding, 17 words. This is the last time I will do this."
4,Convenient and Quality,"I ordered Club Paradise from Amazon Instant Video because I just had a need to watch a funny movie set in the Caribbean. I couldn't find it anywhere else. At $3.99 it's a little steep, but the quality was perfect. If you have a need to watch a particular movie instantly and you can't find it at Netflix or Crackle, this is a great alternative."
3,Club Paradise on DVD please!,"The beach, the sun, the comedy. What a great film! Robin Williams is fantastic and the laughter is non-stop. The soundtrack makes this movie even better. After seeing this you will want to take a vacation to an exotic island and you will find yourself thinking of the great moments of Club Paradise. The worst thing about this movie is the fact that there is no DVD and the soundtrack has been discontinued on CD. With all the movies that are produced on DVD, I cannot undertand why this one is not. Club Paradise is a must see. Enjoy!"
5,I Love this movie!!!,"I watch this movie when I need some good ""mind candy"" entertainment. Having just come back from vacation in Jamaica, it was even more of a joy to watch. Robin Williams is (as always) great fun to watch. Peter O'Toole is classic as the disdainful British expat. Jimmy Cliff is a bonus! Don't expect anything deep, just a bit of parody and fun!"
5,It was great,I think that Club Paradise is a witty movie and well acted. Robin Williams and Peter O'Toole are halarious and are anchored by Jimmy Cliff. I think it is a laugh a minute movie
1,movie,I have not recieved my purchase yet there fore i will not be purchasing any more items off this site.
1,"Seriously, don't waste your time.","We rented this via Video on Demand due to the very positive reviews, but we were sorely disappointed. If you want a funny Robin Williams comedy, choose ""RV"" instead."
1,A dissapointing Robin Williams flik.,"At the video store, I never can choose right away. When I got Club Paradise, I definatly couldn't decide.Robin Williams plays a retired fireman who starts his own resort on an island, and the mishaps are endless!! I didn't laugh very much throughout the whole movie, and found the beginning to hazzy and hard to understand. Even the all-star cast of Joanna Cassidy, Rick Moranis, Peter O' Toole, and more didn't help one bit. Not even the spoof of ""The Gods Must be Crazy"" to end the fiasco didn't lend a hand.To cap it off, don't see Club Paradise."
5,Club Paradise,"I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it in the 80's.I have been trying to get a copy of it ever since. Now I have one and I love it!I love Robin Williams, but it is Peter O'Toole who really makes this movie.The writing is hilarious, but the way Peter O'Toole delivers his lines in such an oh so English, proper and eloquently spoken manner, is just brilliant."
5,Definitely a keeper!,"Fall in love with Peter O'Toole all over again! Lots of little bits all strung together, but a fun movie, anyway! great soundtrack. Amazing to see Twiggy again! Great Saturday afternoon or night movie with popcorn!"
3,"Interesting, but speedy delivery","Bought the book (& CD'S) for mum, born in Scotland...she loves it! I was a bit disappointed in size & quality."
3,Historical Horrors,"The basic description is good enough, but the book then slides into a ""walkers guide"" which was not what I expected. Also, for the walking part, even a sketchy map would have been useful."
1,A waste of money.,Sixty three pages of a vague history of Edinburgh. I had finished the book in less than an hour. The rest of the book is just recycled ghost stories. a waste of time and money. Did the writer do any research at all?I'm generally loathe to pan a book completely but I really am greatly disappointed with this effort.Don't waste your time nor money on this one.
2,o.k. if you like cheap impersonators,"A good movie of the life and times of the king. From the dirt roads of Tupelo to his mansion at graceland, this particulare movie is a good gen- eral one of Elvis. The only real disfunction of this film is the quality of the actors. They do a lackluster job for such a superb man and his friends."
5,Can't get enough of ELVIS,"The 2nd disc is the expanded one with commentaries and extra takes. The DVD was terrific. It carried you from the early life of Elvis until his death. Some scenes were played by actors portraying Elvis as a child and in some other scenes like his death scene at home, but it flows well and there is enough REAL Elvis so as not to hinder the feeling of being an insider into Elvis' life. Just can't seem to get enough of Elvis! A must have for a fan."
3,Great Clips - Useless Recreations,"This review is based upon my BETA edition (which I gave away...). It was thrilling to see Elvis' first national television appearance, a rare cut of ""I Was The One"" from live TV '56, the Hy Gardner interview, and a several other snippets. However, the connecting ""from the grave"" narration and the obviously staged sequences were too much to bear - the time they took producing these embarrassing bits could have been taken up by searching for, locating, and including ""The Pied Piper of Cleveland"" short subject - the ultimate Elvis fan wish-list item. (Excuse my presumptuousness)."
5,You Can Never Have Too Many Elvis DVD's,"I have watched many Elvis dvds, and even though I've seen some of the things on this dvd before, I still enjoyed it. It was presented beautifully and kept me glued to my seat the entire time."
3,From a Non-Fan Perspective...,"I was never a big Elvis fan - didn't dislike him, but his music and style never really attracted my interest. Just to educate myself, I rented this so I could learn about his life and try to get a feel for why he was such a huge sensation. I found this film to be ""okay"" - it wasn't all that engaging and didn't seem to really hook my attention like movies about other famous artists have (for example, ""Ray"" or ""Walk the Line""). This was more of a dry documentary if you ask me, spending a little too much time on events that weren't that interesting (like fist fights), and not enough time on his personal life. Really almost nothing was said about what was going on inside him that led to the end of his marriage and the beginning of his drug problem - these things were presented almost matter-of-fact style. Emotionally lacking, but not terrible."
4,Mix-up,"I rec'd the wrong CD, they are going to exchange it for the right one and offerred to pay for my costs to ship it back. I still have not rec'd it. I'm hoping."
5,Great for repairs around the house,"My husband first purchased this 15 years ago, when we bought a house that had a long crack in the bathtub. After spending all that money buying a house, we just couldn't afford to buy a new tub, and somebody recommended SuperMend. Until about a month ago, the fix to the tub has held, with absolutely no leaks. We bought some more, which should fix our tub again -- at least until our house is paid off."
3,Crazy Fun,"This is the second Cark Hiaasen book I've read, Skinny Dip, the first. Skinny Dip was a delightful surprise and reading Lucky You had me laughing out loud. Hiaasen's character are a rare mix of crazy and real. To say that Hiaasen writes odd, looney tunes characters is putting it mildly. Even the villians are fun to watch as they come to their well deserved ends. Hiaasen has definitely won a fan in me. I'm just wondering which book I should read next."
3,Merely hilarious,"Carl Hiaasen is a writer who likes to portray employing a great sense of humor vivid characters and tipical actions deeply embedded in the American culture, the poor lucky...girl, the medium class journalist, the corrupt judge, the redneck racists, the tricks to make quick and easy moneyDo not expect more than gags in the dialogue and funny situations from this storyGood book for summer vacations particularly if you are from Florida and enjoying the sunshine of the Keys along Route 1,on your way down to Key West."
3,Typical Beach/Plane Fare,"Hiassen's South Florida schtick is fairly entertaining stuff, suitable for airplanes, beaches, and so forth. His forte is creating oddball characters and setting them loose to bounce off each other until the good guys inevitably come out on top. The plot here revolves around two lottery winners, a beautiful black veterinarian's assistant, and a stupid, but dangerous white supremacist cracker. She wants to use her money to buy some land for a nature preserve, while he decides $14 million isn't enough to finance the militia he wants to start up, and thus decides to steal the other ticket. Entering into this is a laconic newspaperman sent to do a story on the woman. Wacky antics and a little nasty violence ensue, everyone gets their just desserts, etc..."
3,Not his best.,"A little slower than I have come to expect. Good, but not great. Still better than many other authors' best work."
3,not up to hiaasen's usual standard.,"these characters were not as developed as most of hiaasen's. i enjoy his put down of the uncontrolled development of my home state. some of the controlled development goes too far as well. i especially enjoy skink. he tells it like it should be! in this ""lucky"" some of the characters were just not believeable. also, some of their actions. i was disappointed, as i have read all of the author's works so far."
5,Carl Hiaasen is a National Treasure,"When more weird and refreshing characters are created, Carl Hiaasen will create them. This guy is a must NEVER miss. All through college and graduate school, I worked in the newsroom of a major daily newspaper. We had feature reporters who would regale us with some pretty hysterical stuff from time to time, but I can't imagine the newsroom of the Miami Herald with Carl Hiaasen and Dave Barry in it. Keep it up, guys. You're wonderful!"
1,Somebody help me!,"Everyone seems to love this book, but I don't get it! The characters were unbelievable, and the plot was even more so. It all seemed so unrealistic, and was definately NOT a page turner except to maybe see how ridiculous it could get. I have no interest in militia rednecks, which seems to be the focus of this book. I really wanted to like it, but alas, did not."
4,Ed Asner brings the characters to life in the audio books!,Audiobook version successfully captured the feel of this Hiaasen novel. Asner's voices for the characters worked well. We were captivated listening - and we both had read the book already. Highly recommend. Some foul language and racist themes would make this story inappropriate for young children.
4,"Funny, original, clever.","As a first time reader of carl hiaasen, I have to say that this man can really write believable characters, of which there are many in this story. I thought he exploited the religious extremist factions of the south particularily well, in a way that was biting and funny, without being cruel. Mr.Hiaasen was able to engage me, make me laugh (which can prove diffucult in writing) and tell a multi-layered story. I enjoyed this book."
2,Not As Lucky As Usual,"Sorry to buck the trend, but while I enjoyed the book (how can one not enjoy a Carl Hiaasen book?), I felt it had a derivative quality that brought the score down substantially. The business of having something stuck to the bad guy's hand (this time a crab; in Double Whammy, a pit bull) was done before. Krome was too reminiscent of the good guy in Double Whammy. And finally the plot, even for Carl Hiaasen, seemed too far-fetched."
3,that's Florida alright,"I enjoyed it very much and after reading Elmore Leonard this seems to be a new author for me to check into and read more. If you live in Florida like I do, you'll know that there could be a possibility, that it is not just fiction."
1,The worst he's written.,"I couldn't wait for the latest Hiaasen book to come out in paperback - they're usually clever and exciting. But this one is a bomb. I couldn't get past the second chapter. The story is filled with a hatred for all things conservative. I don't mind his opinions, but it hardly makes for a good read. Next time I'll scan the book first before I buy one of his. It's the kind of read that makes you wish you could return books if they're not up to snuff. Carl, go back to slanting the news - it's where liberals belong!"
3,Pretty Good,"I found this book to be very good, considering one of the only reason I read it was because two of my friends tried it, and did not like it. It was a wee bit excessive with the swearing (about five swears per page, including the f-, s-, b-, and d- word), but the plot made up for that. By the end of the book, all the loose ends had been tied up, so one is not left hanging. The only problem would be if the reader was sensitive to racist words. Of course, the two ""bad guys"" are white supremacists and they use racist words, so it must be done to get the correct redneck vibe. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good fiction novel, and does not mind a handful of cussing. Enjoy!"
4,Not bad for my first Carl Hiaasen book...,"A friend of mine recommended this book. He said that CH was a bit descriptive at times but it was a good read. He was right, and it was descriptive, especially the part about the buzzards..you know what I mean if you read this. Yuk! I laughed mostly at the pathetic predictable antics of the two yahoo rednecks. IT was funny, a good read, and even had a message or two in there. For my first Hiaasen book, I was impressed."
4,Lucky Me!,"Carl Hiaasen offers another South Florida adventure, complete with a cast of weirdos and losers those of us in the Northeast can only dream about. It must just get too cold up here for the freakiest social misfits, but they seem to feel right at home in Mr. Hiaasen's funny tangle of a book."
5,LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY!!!,C HIAASEN has perfect comedic timing in his writing. Over the top nasty humor leaves me questioning mymorals and sensitivities while I am sitting there reading and laughing. Powerful writing about the fragility about Floridaenvironment creeps into all of his books. His characters are unforgettable! His books make any trip or wait for an appointment shorter than you want them to be.
4,Very funny,Carl Hiassen develops his stories around events that actually happened in Florida. Of course he elaborates and stretches the stories but of course you have to live in Florida to appreciate how crazy things are here. I laughed out loud more that once and thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. RB
2,Fair to average,"This is the book is pretty weak by Hiaasen's standards. I have read ""Double Whammy"", ""Tourist Season"", & ""Stormy Weather"", and this book stands below them. While Hiaasen excels in satire, and in both outlandish characters and stories, this book stretches that limit, and creates both characters and a story that are so absurd that it drags on and on. In his other books the central character at least has a semblance of normality to them that makes them easy to relate to, and keeps you interested in the story and how events unfold. In Lucky You, all of the characters lives are the extreme, and while events are amusing it goes overboard to the point that you lose interest. I have found myself putting this book down several times. The only thing that has me picking it back up, is that I have been a fan of Hiaasen's other books. So unless you're a diehard fan of Hiaasen's, I would suggest you skip this one, and move on to another book."
2,The bottom of the Hiaasen barrel,"I've read a half dozen of Hiaasen's books and this one I would have to rank as the worst. The story was rather predictable and didn't surprise me, and the characters were all lackluster and unlikeable. The book's main themes were based on racism and religion, two genres which are not at the top of my comedy scale. If you are new to Hiaasen, I'd suggest one of my favorites, either Native Tongue or Stormy Weather."
1,"Carl, You Ain't No Kinky Friedman","Carl shouldn't have to try so hard. After all, the protagonist is a hack columnist for a Florida newspaper (Wow, what a stretch! Hey, your Miami Herald teammate Dave Barry is able to push the envelope more than that!), but in Hiaasen's backbreaking effort to be droll, he does little but weave a heavy-handed, mean-spirited caricature of Florida's ""little people"" (in the sense that Hillary or Leona considers most of us little people).The net product is an ugly yarn that goes on too long. For a dark, misanthropic, sarcastic novel with outlandish characters that is actually funny, I recommend Kinky Friedman, who manages to amuse while getting his ""politically correct"" (guns and Republicans are bad) point across. Try ""Spanking Watson"" or ""Roadkill"" for some real fun."
2,"Oh, no! Not more yucky characters!","I must tell you that I didn't finish this book. I barely started it. I got to something like chapter 5 and put it down. The writing is captivating, the characters well made, the plot entertaining. However, I'm not really interested in a disection of prejudiced, uneducated sickos. I'm also not interested in knowing what happens to people who take the law into their own hands. We have enough problems around here without someone offering us more ways to subvert the system. Maybe you like that kind of thing. So then read this book. Otherwise, pick up something by Robert B. Parker."
3,Lucky Carl,"Being a huge Carl Hiaassen fan, I could not wait for ""Lucky You"" to come out. The previous novel ""Stormy Weather"" was showing a little lack of imagination for Hiaasen, and I was hoping he would get it back.""Lucky You"" hits most of the times but misses a few cylinders in the long run. The idea of two winning lotto tickets and one winner not happy that they must share, who decide to steal the other ticket from a single African American women. The bad guys once again are the best written characters in the book. Hiaasen does dive into looney topics of South Florida again, mainly looking at christanity taken to extremes. Hiaasen is still the best at the genre, he may be slipping a little but there is nothing in this book to make you stay away. Carl is lucky that this is not his first book, we all can say that he may be in a rut, but will come out of it. Looking forward to ""Sick Puppy""."
2,Formulaic and dissappointing,"Though I am a huge Hiaasen fan, this one left me cold. Several glaring typos and overt publisher mistakes evidenced a rush job. Has Carl fallen victim to shameless Floridian opportunism? Did Demi Moore wreck a good thing? Mediocre characters, a boring religious subplot, a thoroughly predictable ending, and no Skink. Native Tongue and Double Whammy are far better."
3,Readable but...,"Lucky You sets us up for what appears to be a funny story, then shoots itself in the foot. Hiaasen has so much hatred for his villains that the story leaves the realm of funny adventure and enters disturbing territory as we near the close.Still, it's an easy read. It's not a bad novel to take with you on vacation or a business trip."
4,He's ba-a-a-a-ck!,"Hiaasen hit his peak with Skin Tight and Native Tongue, then seemed to be straining for subject matter and humor in his most recent books. Not to worry. He's back in good form with Lucky You! From the woman who wears an old bridal gown to worship at ""the roadstain Jesus"" to the newspaper editor who enjoys sitting in a muddy ""moat"" surrounded by cooters and speaking in tongues, Hiaasen's outrageous characters are the perfect antidote to somber side of literature and even to life itself."
4,"A great book for Hiaasen fans, or wannabes!","Carl does it again! This is one great read, especially if you're on the beach here in Florida. Hiaasen's writing plays like a fast-moving drama in your mind. The pages fly by, and his style keeps the many threads of storyline clear. After you read this, search out the rest of his books. Better yet, take my word for it and order a half-dozen or so and bring 'em with you on vacation!"
3,A few laughs.....lots of wierdos,I did laugh at many places in this novel. I enjoyed the authors ability to turn a phrase. I did feel that it was a bit more violent then I like. I don't think the ending was very moral.
5,the best yet!,"i've read all of carl haaisen's novels and this is the craziest!.... his characters remind me of the people that i work with in seabrook, new hampshire..."
4,Luck had nothing to do with it...,"This was my first Hiaasen novel after my wife had recommended them for some time. The wacky characters are bearable, but the several looping plot strings are sometimes tedious. The main characters are fairly appealing, but the secondary characters are unbelievable to the point of losing my interest. It wasn't bad enough to make me swear off Hiaasen, but it won't make me rush out to buy more, either."
5,Great!,Any book that can use bear mace as a plot device has to be interesting. We are Carl Hiaasen devotes and enjoyed this book as we have enjoyed his others. There is no other novelist who can describe characters and their foibles with such wit and hilarity. There are also few books that lead to the reader to repeated outbursts of laughter- Hiaasen's always do and that is greatly appreciated!
2,Disappointing but worth reading,"The two bad guys in this novel are very well described but the black lottery winner and black highway patrolmen are not believable. He pokes fun at small Florida towns, some of which is accurate and some is run into the ground. Personally, this is the least enjoyable of his novels, but is still funny in many places. Take a chance."
3,Tries too hard,"I've read and hugely enjoyed most of Carl Hiaasen's books, but Lucky You disappointed me. Oh, the same quirky characters are there, and the dialogue has its usual wit, but the gags are too much, too often, and by the end of the book the humor was worn down to a nub.That, plus many of the plot devices were amateur-clumsy, and one was completely unforgiveable.If you're reading Carl Hiaasen for the first time, try another book. If you're a veteran reader of his, this one will give you some laughs, but be prepared for a disappointing outing."
2,Not up to Hiaasen's Standards,"Carl Hiaasen is an outstanding observer of Florida. His earlier novels balanced a biting social commentary with a story that flew and outstanding humor. Unfortunately, ""Lucky You"" doesn't live up to the expectations which we've come to expect from Hiaasen. He almost comes across as one of the folks he lampoons, a characiture of himself. If you're in the mood from some good Hiaasen, skip this book and go directly to his next one, ""Sick Puppy"". You'll be so glad you did."
1,Lousy,"I can't imagine why Kirkus and so many readers liked this book. With its smirking racism, cardboard characters, and a writing style that wants to be Elmore Leonard but misses by a mile, there is absolutely nothing to like."
5,"Wacky, Entertaining","Characters with issues, that's what makes the folks that populate this novel intriguing--because they may just be the very people you walk passed in the street, you never know...Screwballish, nutty. Anyway, it's entertaining in a disturbing way."
3,Feels like its trying too hard to be zany.,"I think I may have been spoiled by the fact that the first Hiaasen I read was Sick Puppy. That book made me laugh out loud. Since then, I've read nearly a half dozen more books by Hiaasen and, while all were enjoyable, none have really reached the heights of enjoyment for me that Sick Puppy did. Lucky You has the wacky characters and the environmentalist slant as usual but it just seemed to be working overtime to be wild and wacky...kind of a piling-on effect that became a bit obnoxious. Not a BAD book, but a more mediocre one than I've come to expect from this author."
4,Short and sweet,"This book told me everything I needed to know to get started buying and selling on eBay. The section on etiquette, and the tips and tricks section were especially helpful.I love the writing style, it really cuts to the chase when it comes to covering the material. In its short 29 pages I went from being pretty much of a newbie to being a confident buyer and seller, armed with some useful tips that usually only experience would bring.It should however be noted that this guide is more for the casual user, if you're looking to start a business selling on ebay, you might want to pick up a book that focuses a bit more on selling."
4,A good investment for stock traders,"I have to laugh at the people who gripe about the price of this book, or any other one for that matter. Point blank, books like this one should be considered investments. If they provide you with information to increase your trading profitability or minimize your losses, then the investment has paid off.How Markets Really Work is definitely a concise text. I, for one, am happy for that. It is a research report which presents a significant proposition and provides considerable evidence to support it. This book does that efficiently with no extra prose and loads of visual support making it a quick read and one that definitely makes the point it seeks to make.If you are a stock market trader, especially one focused on the indices, How Markets Really Work is a very good investment. It could very well alter the way you approach your trading."
1,I have read a lot of investment books,"This one is BY FAR the biggest waste of money of them all. This guy basically presents ONE idea in the whopping 145 pages, of which 75, yes SEVENTY FIVE are graphs that show, literally 2 bars or 2 lines. This is absolutely not an exaggeration. 75 of the 145 8.5"" by 11"" pages have ONE graph with 2 bars showing a comparison of, for example, how the S&P 500 performed after 2 consecutive down days over the next week vs 2 consecutive up days. That's it. Nothing else. 18 pages are tables of numbers that, if you've read one of them, you've read them all. This leaves 53 other pages, of which 11 are COMPLETELY BLANK!! Of the 42 remaining pages, maybe 10 of them have more than 2 paragraphs and fill more than 2/3rds of the page. This book is a complete sham. I highly recommend Amazon pull it. I will be calling Amazon to return this book immediately for a full refund."
2,had potential,"I think that the results that the author finds are helpful and interesting, but this should have been a research paper instead of a $50 book. There is just too much fluff with the 1 bar graph, 1 line graph per page for 5 different results and a paragraph or two of explanation. It would have been better to present the table and then select one or two line graphs to give the reader the gist of the argument. The bar charts are completely useless.Essentially these statistical results show that being a contrarian pays.I think it would have been helpful if the author could have created a trading system out of all this data to present to the readers. I would have thrown in an extra star or two if it had good results.The ""Free 7'day Trial of Larry Connors' Daily Trading Service"" that is mentioned in-between EVERY chapter is very annoying.I literally read this 'book' in an hour."
2,It's a big advertisement,"I was disappointed in how small this book was, and that on every other page it was selling other books or even T-shirts! I think it could have been a lot better. The one chapter in The Girlfriend's Guide to the Toddler Years that deals with bringing another baby into the house was more insightful than this entire book."
2,Disappointed,"I had hoped this book would provide more insight and ideas. I didn't feel it really addressed preparing children based on their ages and understanding, and I wanted to know what a two-year-old will be feeling and thinking about a new baby, and I was hoping for more ideas. There are a few funny anecdotes, but overall, I didn't find anything useful."
2,Still want the book...but it hasn't arrived yet!,"I know this book, love this book, had this book and I gave it to a friend who was expecting. Now I ordered a copy to have for someone else BUT it hasn't arrived:( Sure hope it comes soon."
5,Great Gift,I bought this book for myself first and after reading it I bought 2 more for my pregnant friends. We all are pregnant with our 2nd child and this book was an easy read with great ideas. The ideas for helping your child adjust and welcome the new baby were great. I can't wait to use some of them. I really enoyed this book!
1,Still waiting!!!,"I ordered this in Jan. and its almost March. They said it would arrive before the superbowl (the reason I placed the order) and that game has long been over with and yet I'm still here waiting on this order. I ordered 4 other things that same day and received them all before the game. Yet, still waiting on this. Amazon is rather quick with shipping and have never had a problem with them. Its FansEdge that I will never buy from again. I have no idea why Amazon would work with this company. I wish I read their reviews before placing the order."
4,A toy destroyed is a toy enjoyed!,I didn't get a chance to study this toy very long. My birds decided it was the most interesting thing in the cage and it was splinters by morning. I will definitely buy again and buy more.
5,Such a fun movie,Marilyn Monroe is definitely one of the most oversexed and typecasted actresses of all time but that can't change the fact that she was the best at what she did! This movie is one of my favorite Marilyn movies of all time and Jane Russell was the perfect actress to play Marilyn's friend. If you're looking for something thought-provoking and metaphorical then look elsewhere but if you're looking for a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously then Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is the right movie for you!
4,A Razzle Dazzle Comedy,Easily one of Marilyn Monroe's best movies! She may be a ditz but nobody does it with more style than Marilyn. The costumes are beautiful and the song numbers make the show a delight to watch!
4,Light Marylin vehicle,"MY RATING- 7.6GENTLEMAN PREFER BLONDES is the mov that contains the immortal scene of Marylin singing ""Diamonds are the Girls Best Friends"".It's much more than that, it's a light romantic comedy with Marylin and Jane Russel finding their ideal and millionaire husbands. Most of the action occurs in a cruise in the Atlantic also with old Charles Coburn delivering good moments with both girls.If we compare this one to SEVEN YEAR ITCH or BUS STOP we see that they're obviously superior, yet somehow this one became famous probably to the color of Marylin's hair. In fact I conly count one or two really funny sequences, while other Marylin's movs have non-stop gags.Yet watch it, if you want to enjoy beautiful Marylin and Jane and some nice mov!"
5,This Musical is a Girl's Best Friend,"This movie is a classic. From Marilyn's diamonds to Jane's hunka man, this is fabulous. An enternaining movie that you can watch again and again."
1,WRONG ISSUE,"I love this film, but you have sent me the 2001 issue and not the 3 August 2010 one. This is not fair, I am one of your best customers."
5,"this is a funny, cute, romantic, awsome movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","the movie is about a girl, and her friend look for men to marry. it's a cool movie, with wonderful songs, and ""classic"" marilyn acting."
3,Blondies,This is another of the videos of the early 20th century. Some among us love the old classics.
3,GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTY GRABLE,"Yes Gentlmen do prefer blondes, and this movie was to star Fox,s top blonde Betty Grable!, but Marilyn was charming the Fox excecsGrable was on suspension after refusing pick up on south street, Monroe got the job, oh dear Betty you should have been in blondes,Que sera sera"
5,The Best of Marilyn,"The Diamond Collection is a Marilyn Monroe fan's dream come true! Five of Marilyn's most enjoyable films finally on DVD and in Widescreen! The bonus material is worth the price of the collection. Marilyn's uncompleted film, ""Somethings Got to Give"" is included in the bonus material. Marilyn never looked lovelier than in this ill fated movie. What a great way to celebrate Marilyn's birthday and career!"
5,Marilyn Monroe-PINK DIAMOND!,"This has to be the greatest collection of monroe movies anywhere!-Bus Stop-""Why I'd go anywhere in the world with you now!"" ""Aaaaaghhh! You ain't got the manners of a monkey, I hate you and I despise you! And give me back my tail!!!"" ""I told you my name is not Cherry, it's Sharie'!"" Gentlemen prefer blondes-""Daddy daddy daddy, what did you buy me this week, I should have the tiara, after all she has you!"" ""Hi I'm Lora-li Lee, and I don't want to marry your son for his money, I want to marry him for your money!"" Seven year itch-When it's hot in the summer you know where I put my panty's, in the ice box!"" ""If your wife tells you got cranberry sauce on your collar, tell her she's got cherry pits in her head!"" ""Potatoe chips and Champagne, how romantic!"" This Diamond collection is a blessing for every Monroe nut, enjoy!-love Marilyn!"
3,"Good, but not great","A wonderful box set, with the exception of ""There's No Business Like Show business"". ""Niagara"" or ""Let's Make Love"" would've fitted better in this collection.In the ""The Last Days"" disk, there is a reconstruction of Marilyn's last film ""Something's Got to Give"". It is unfortunate that Marilyn died before completing the film, because from watching the first half of it, you could tell that had it been completed, it would've been a bad a** movie. Just as the plot thickens, the director calls ""cut!"" and leaves the viewer to forever wonder how the film would've ended."
5,"Touching, heartbreaking, intelligent, and honest","This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. Dawn Powell turns what could be the stuff of melodrama--small-town girlhood with an unloving stepmother--into a deeply beautiful exploration of growing up and finding strength and beauty wherever you can. It is as smart as the very best of Tolstoy, as witty as Chekhov, as purely American as Mark Twain, and still as uplifting (and accessible) as any Oprah's Book Club selection could hope to be. It's an almost perfect book, and one you will never forget."
5,A haunting autobiographical novel of childhood,"This is a novel closely based on the author's childhood, growing up in rural Ohio in the early 20th century. While Dawn Powell uses an adult's language, the perspective is a child's. Although there is nothing monumental about the characters or their fates, the depth to which the reader sees and understands them is a testament to the author's skill. The writing is exquisite and the story is gripping in its depiction of a child's resilience in the face of adults who fail her at almost every turn. I finished the book weeks ago and am still thinking about it"
2,contents were too busy and overstuffed for a prep guide,"If you're looking for a study guide in preparation for the PALS course, this is not the book to read. Don't get me wrong, it is a very good book. A lot of great facts and contents. But I felt overwhelmed and fustrated after reading this book preparing for the PALS course. I just went overboard with the facts. I think the contents in this book would be appropriate for an instructor. You're better off getting the basic PALS study guide from AHA."
1,PALS STUDY GUIDE,It was a waste of money. I went to the AHA site and was directed to the correct book.
5,EXCELLENT EASY READING,THIS BOOK GRABS YOU ON PAGE ONE. IT IS EXCELLENT SUMMER READING. MAKES YOU WANT TO HEAD TO THE BEACH!! EXCELLENT BOOK
2,Charging The Wii,"When it comes to the Nintendo Wii, the battery life isn't really what it seems to be. The batteries can die very quickly if you're a hard hitting gamer. Unfortunately, a lot of third party companies have made rechargable batteries that try to work for Wii owners, but they just don't hit the nail on the head. this Wii Charge N' Play is a way to replace the need of using AA batteries with your Wii Remote. Sadly though, the battery does seem like a nice fit, but the main problem with the device is that it shorts out very quickly while you're playing. It is very sad, and doesn't show it is worth the money. Instead, let's hope Nintendo makes their own rechargable battery for the Wii that does the trick better.Price: DConvience: COverall: D+"
1,Sucks!,"only holds a charge for about 2 hours. go buy some rechargable batteries from energizer, they last *much* longer!"
5,For Die-Hard Chuck Norris fans ONLY!,This movie is definetly for the Die-Hard Norris fan. Full of action and adventure this movie is definetly a must see by fans every where especially if you've seen Missing in Actions I and II.
4,Some of the best Chuck 'Hand to Hand' combat,"Amongst all the generally ropey films that Chuck made with Cannon, this is one of the best.Blistering action, excellent hand to hand combat scenes and pacey throughout, this film is not only essential for a Chuck fans but also for those who enjoy a no-holds-barred beat-em up with plenty of pyrotechnics for good measure."
4,A mixed bag.,"This book does a fairly lucid and impartial job of examining eight potentially controversial claims.The best chapter is the one on placebos, which convinced me that my previous reasons for believing in a placebo effect were wrong, and then showed that it was still quite possible that placebo effects are real.But much of the book is a good deal more forgettable. His discussion of homosexuality might strike a few rabid Lysenkoists as preposterous, but most educated people should find his answers unsurprising. And his approach isn't nearly as valuable when dealing with hotly debated topics such as global warming as it is when he is bringing overlooked controversies to our attention."
1,blurry video? dvd defect? camera defect?,"my copy has a blurry effect around things, when things move in the video, clear on the drummer. i don't know if it's only my copy or all copies are like this.

3,So cute and good deal! But not great condition...,"It's so cute! The quilt is very beautiful unisex design.I got it more than 50% off, good deal. Quilt and bumper is 100% cotton with polyester Fill.But as some people complained about Amazon sale items, the plastic cover bag has dust and label of quilt creased not as brand new as the label of bumper. My spouse really love the beautiful design and isn't picky, so we decide keep it. Maybe what I get is the only open item in stock. Wish other people will have better luck."
4,A good escape from the daily routine,"Having used Jane Fonda's Yoga video and been to several yoga classes, I found Kundalini Yoga and especially this tape a pleasant surprise. It is a different type of yoga that combines floor aerobics, toning, and relaxation classes into 1 hour.You do sweat and get a decent aerobic workout, but in addition, after the meditation cooldown, you also end up feeling relaxed and your mind is clear. The background (natural setting in Maui) and Gurmukh's soothing voice add to the escape.Please be advised - you should probably stretch before doing the tape - otherwise you may end up with sore hamstrings and thighs like me the first few times."
5,Best Yoga video so far...,"Its produced very well; gives a good sense of Kundalini, and is fun to do. Good for beginner and expert. Remember, if you're not into it, you can skip the religious leanings toward at the begining of the tape. joel"
2,More style than substance,"I admit that I'm a novice Kundalini student, but this video resembles neither the class I take, what I've read about the practice, nor the other video I have, which is Kundalini With Grace & Strength by Carol Carlson.I know Gurmukh is one of the more famous teachers of this type of yoga, but I felt like this particular video was ""dumbed down"", with lots of pretty shots of Maui and the buff students (which I didn't see the point of since Gurmukh tells you at the beginning that Kundalini is best practiced with your eyes shut). I agree with the reviewer from Canada that the ""breath of fire"" practice was lacking, and the jumping around throwing punches felt more like Tae-Bo than yoga. The deep relaxation part at the end was also very short.As a generic workout tape, it gets you moving around at least, but as a yoga tape, it's only so-so. Carol Carlson's tape is better."
2,a bit more warm-up needed,"I had been doing the Kripalu and Kathy Smith yoga videos since last April and thought I needed something different. The first time I did this one, my legs were sore for a week. This last time, I've hurt my back. I have never had problems with aches or pains with any of the others, and will be going back to the slower, gentler approaches.In all fairness, I probably should have taken the video at my own pace, rather than try to go as quickly as she tells the viewer to go."
2,Not my yoga.,"I really appreciated the production value of this video. The setting is nice, the people demonstrating the workout are real, normal, healthy looking people, and Gurmukh seams like a wonderful person. But...I think this workout is crazy! I feel awful giving this video such a bad review, but it really rubs me the wrong way. I come from a background of dance and yoga, where you use control in your movements and body awareness to keep you safe from injury. At several points in the video, Gurmukh advises you to 'just go, don't worry about the form' and I can't agree with this approach.The workout is not what you'd expect from yoga, it's very fast paced, very cardio vascular, with lots of fast leg kicks and arm flapping, all done with this kind of 'throw yourself into it' approach. I know from taking dance classes for so long that you can really injure yourself by throwing your body around like this. Sorry Gurmukh!"
3,sore muscles and joints,"I found that with all of the arm flapping this was not a very mindful yoga video and the next day my back muscles, and arm joints ached, less pretending to fly would have made this a better video"
2,"Unusual yoga, poor music","I wanted to try a Kundalini tape and got this as a gift. The instruction was poorly directed, but it is not a fault of the teacher. Little was done to capture her charisma. And who is the big brunette with the shoulders? Can't they ever pick normal looking people? The music was more of a distraction and the Cindy thing was a real turnoff. I think whoever made this tape could have done a much better job like Rodnee's tape."
1,Yogi to the Stars,Be wary of Yogis who have an agenda. That in itself disqualifies them from being taken seriously. Service without expectation of the outcome is key to the yogic path. GK is a bit of a prima donna.
2,Cindy sells bogus yoga.,"This instructor was very unique and quite lovely, but where's my Cindy signature Omega watch? The music was fab. Make a CD. I'll buy it. This tape looks like it was cut by amatuers and they stuck Hawaii in to make up for less than spectatular directorial sense and instructional substance. Watch the yoga not the foliage and flap those arms. This tape will make you and Cindy fly."
3,peculiar?,"Walker Percy is a great writer and thinker (ie., Thanatos Syndrome & Lost In The Cosmos) but I must say I just couldn't relate to this particular peculiar book. Honestly, I read it all, and kept waiting, waiting for something... at the end I was disappointed. I could not get into the armageddonish or rather apocalyptic mode of this book... it takes place in the future which is actually the past though? Help me, please. I honestly kept thinking that one has to be from the deep south (of the U.S.A.) to fully appreciate the racial things that are going on in the book... and since I'm not, I want to be fair and say the book is O.K. Percy rocks, but in this particular case, he did not rock MY world? Maybe I need a Lapsometer treatment?"
1,buy something else,for the price i could have purchased most of the other elizibethtown cds and had more music too...not much value here
4,Caution! This is a SONY's copy-protected CD,"The contents of this CD are good enough for me, really nice. But there is a problem that this is a SONY's copy-protected CD includes software ""SunnComm MediaMax"". If you want to listen this album on your PC, it's good for you to know about SONY's protected CD scandal."
4,The songs seemed better in the movie.,"The music is alright. In the film, I felt connected to the songs, but without the film much of that connection is lost."
3,just so so,"This CD wasn't as good as the Elizabethtown soundtrack. It had very few songs, and they were ok, but not my favorite compilation."
5,get this book,"The introduction is great, but the journey through the different political writings is the best."
3,"Strong vibrating alarm, but NOT silent!","The InnoPak vibrating alarm module does a good job of getting your attention with a quite strong vibrating alarm, but it definitely is NOT silent! It's the noisiest vibrating alarm I've ever heard, and I have had a number of cellphones and pagers over the years. If you need something that will get your attention better than the relatively weak speaker of the Visor, this module is for you, but if you want something that will be a discrete alarm during meetings or at the theatre, I don't recommend it. By the way, the 2MB storage works just fine -- exactly like the 8MB flash module with the same File Mover application."
4,Excellent book,I baked a vanilla cake and a chocolate cake. The vanilla cake came out light and fluffy. The chocolate cake came out dense and rich-too rich for this chocolate lover. The chocolate cake didn't even call for flour. hmmmm This is an excellent book and the title holds true to its intentions.
1,Disappointing results,"After baking two recipes from the book, I was very displeased with cake results - both were complete failures. It makes me wonder if the book was written without adequate pre-baking of published recipes. A total waste of money."
1,Really dumb and repetative,"The big secret? Get some of the prep done while the mixer is running. And use shiney pans and put the oven up to 400. If you read the title carefully, it says, ""recipes that will change the way you BAKE cakes forever"", and on the back cover, the description is, "". . .""cakes that BAKE in half the time"". Not that take half the time to make, from start to finish, but BAKE in half the time. It's not that the recipes are bad, it's just that there are much better cake books out there, and the whole premise of the book could be summed up in 2 sentences and the rest is a waste, meaning that this book is one big rip-off."
3,One flaw,"These silicone baking dishes are great except for one flaw that can be major or minor depending on your personal use: You can't cut anything in these pans. If you like to bake something and cut it while it is still in the pan, forget it with these, because the knife will cut right through the pan."
3,"Rhinoceros is important, I wonder about the other plays",Rhinoceros is an important twentieth century intellectual work about fascist mindcontrol and seeing your friends and neighbors turn into something other than human beings. Years before the pod people were snatching bodies on our movie screens Ionesco's Parisians were transforming into nonhuman rhinoceri.
3,Dated Translation,"Ionesco is one of the greatest of the absurdist playwrights. Rhinoceros is a great piece -- an amalgam of comedy and tragedy that will have you doubled over in laughter one moment and desperately frightened the next.That being said, this translation has some serious problems. It was very strange to read as an American in 2004, because it is written in the English spoken in Great Britain in the 1960s. In addition to serious liberties taken by the translator (i.e. simply leaving out certain lines), there sometimes crops up a lack of flow that is all too common in translated literature.Despite the fact that it's time for a new translation, I highly recommend Ionesco's plays, and Rhinoceros in particular. If you know French, read the original!"
4,Superb,"A mind-twisting collection of Ionesco's best drama. Incredible, fantastic and filled with originality. Add this one to your bookshelf. Best quote - ' All cats die, Socrates is dead. Therefore, Socrates is a cat'"
5,Enduring writer,"Ionesco has written wonderful plays showing the idiocy of modern life and its materialistic bent. It is perfect for the very sad and realistic times we live in; his absurdity has become our reality. He, with great artistry, has held up the mirror to a corrupt society on the political, social, psychological and religious levels. He doesn't pull punches. Everyone should read him. He's profound. And yes he does use humor to make his points."
3,The French Version,"Well, I am currently reading the French version of the play, and thankful for doing so. The english version is so off by literal standards it takes much of the meaning away. The entire cat discussion-that was based on cats and dogs-a dog has 4 paws therefore it is a cat because a cat has 4 paws. It is a very absurd play-but better in french."
1,Logos not sewn on.,logos and wording are rubber iron on. Will not hold up with washings. I was expecting sewn on at this price.
3,Not Quite All There,"Yet another reissue of the Basie-Bennett Roulette album!!! There must be six different discs including this material on the market. This is one of the lesser offerings. Although the material included is very good, this disc does not include the entire 1959 album- it deletes the wonderful ""Growing Pains,"" which Bennett performed accompanied only by the guitar. The extra tracks are all fairly inspired Basie offerings, but do not hail from the origianl album. A dedicated collector will want to track down a complete recording of the ""Bennett Sings- Basie Swings"" album, but a casual listener will find much to enjoy here."
5,Shot Down,I met Mr. Phelper many years ago as he had just finished his book and was selling it door to door. He autographed a copy for me but it got lost in the years.I was so glad to find a copy at Amazon.His story is most interesting and should be preserved as part of World War Two History.
1,Disappointment,"This text leaves much to be desired as an application-intensive calculus primer and fails even more miserably as a proof-intensive development of multivariable analysis. My complaints are,1) The writing style is convoluted, boring, at times directionless.2) I had to severely edit the proofs before they were respectable. Many of the proofs suffer from blatant flaws. ertain proofs are not even proofs, but conclude with the statement: ""an obvious pattern emerges"" as opposed to making the appropriate inductive argument.3) The definitions are unspecific and often involve mere hand-waving.4) The examples are unhelpful and not illustrative.5) This is just personal preference, but I really don't like Folland's topology notation and have frequent problems with the rest of his notation.There are better books out there. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,Disappointing and Numerous Errors,"To be brief, Folland has a list of errata that is three pages long on his website to correct all the mistakes he made when writing this book. On top of that, instead of using proofs that are rudimentary he chooses more clever proofs. While this is concise, it has a large pitfall since it does not correlate to other texts that are in analysis/calculus."
3,not too good...,"I can't really think of good things to say about this book... There aren't enough problems & definitely not enough examples (like 1 or 2 in each section). The explanation is ok but more examples would have made this book much more helpful. This book is pretty average. I don't know if the Schaum's Advanced Calculus book is the best, but it's better than this one."
3,I've played so many versions of this game I can't keep them straight.,"They're all very sim oriented, and very difficult. I play Forza Motorsport quite a bit, which is also more sim oriented, but it is easy by comparison. I've never played a version of this for over one race before giving up in frustration."
5,Koro Isis Ka and Involution,"This is a very fine short novel. It is fascinating, exciting, terrifying and very well written. I could not stop reading it once I had started.The collection of poems is also very good, very thought provoking.I highly recommend this work by a very talented new artist."
5,Chris follows his soul,"If you've seen Chris Duarte live, even if only one time, you know he has a depth of soul that draws you to not only his music, but to him personally. Following the musical development of someone like Chris who is truly unique (a word overused but in Chris' case, accurate) is rewarding no matter what style he may be playing at the moment. The 30-second bites from ""Romp"" DO accurately represent this CD. If you like Chris Duarte, you will like this CD. If you spend time picking apart blues vs. rock vs. whatever, you don't have a full understanding of Chris Duarte. This CD is dynamite."
3,A few good licks,"Chris is a great guitar player, but his style becomes a little redundant as you go through the songs. Lyrics are very unique. He is not afraid to be straightforward and from the heart."
3,Romp,"Sugar Strat magic is still his best CD so far. His last 2 cd's were alittle strange for me so this is an improvement. I can't write such a glowing review as the others have to far. Given second chance I would not have bought this cd. Its pretty good but I was hoping for something along the lines of his earlier release ""Sugar Strat Magic"". Romp just has not grabbed me yet even after my third time though."
2,A bad CD by a great musician,"When it's all said and done, we'll look back on Romp as Chris Duarte's weakest effort. It seems all great artists have a time period where their music takes a dive. This is it for Chris. He spends more time trying to be who he is not instead of being who he is. His strength is straight-up blues with some rock dynamics thrown in. Unfortunately, this CD features very little blues. Bb blues is the only song worth listening to on this CD in my opinion. I love Chris and have seen him several times and I don't blame him for trying to stretch out and explore but here's the bottom line....he's world class at traditional blues/blues rock...unfortunately Romp focuses on the skills he is weak at...vocals and songwriting in shakey, undefined rock style. If you like the music on Texas Sugar Strat Magic and his second CD, you will be sorely dissappointed in Romp. CHRIS DUARTE...PLAY THE BLUES."
4,Smokin!,"Austin guitarist Chris Duarte can't seem to escape the shadow of Stevie Ray Vaughan. Much like Stevie, Chris started young. By the age of fifteen, Chris was playing jazz and blues in Austin clubs. His first few albums solidified his hold on the title of ""the next Stevie Ray"". The thing is, Chris is worthy of your respect without labeling him the next anybody. Let somebody else be ""the next Chris Duarte"". ""Romp"" goes a long way towards showing folks that Chris isn't just another Texan with a guitar. In fact, most of ""Romp"" recalls Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Winter and Jeff Beck as much as or more than Stevie. Recommended cuts include ""Do the Romp"", ""Fire's Gone Out"" and ""Bb Blues"". Chris explodes on the uptempo numbers and is appropriately smoldering and sinister on the slow stuff. Really fine stuff for those of you who don't insist that he do the same thing over and over again. Check it out!"
4,Very good listening!,"This album is a bit over-orchestrated at times, but it doesn't dimish the fact that Michael Ball has a great voice and can really handle these songs. I'd gotten tired of various versions of ""The Rose,"" but now I love it. But it's impossible to pick a favorite song!"
3,"Good while they lasted, Already broke.",My daughter received these headphones. One bad pull resulted in the cable disconnecting. Don't think it is poor equipment just need stronger wire when made for children.
3,Cute but the ears broke off,These headphones are really cute for the first 2 hours then the ears broke off. Of course that does not affect the sound at all but it is irritating. I do like the size. They fit great on my 2 year old. It took a while to train her to keep them on but she likes them now.
2,nice product but fragile,"This is a terrific product for small kids. sound is not great but they fit well and they're fun so the kids wanna use them. the sound even is not a big deal as little einsteins is about as audiophile as our 2 year old gets. BUT, we have now had 2 of these that after about a year of regular use, the one phone just gave out. checked the wiring and it seems to be ok, or at least no obvious loose wires. they are not expensive so not a big deal but it's a shame that a good product can't last longer, mostly from the point of view of the waste and environment and all."
3,Cute but sized for toddlers.,I got these for my 7 year old to plug into his tablet. They worked but are way to small for a 7 year old. I exchanged them for a more traditional set. Some sort of sizing guide in the product description would have avoided this minor hassle.
3,They work ok,These are super cute and my 2 yo likes them...the clarity is so-so. They do reduce outside noise pretty well.
5,Cute and durable!,"Bought this adorable headset for my 2.5 y.o. grandson and they are a perfect fit for our little guy. He thought they were ""really cool"". He loves to listen to books and music and this is great because he can hear the sound better and it doesn't interfere with the activities of others at home or on the go."
5,Beats got nothing on these,"Let me start out by saying for a 30+ year old man I have a particularly small head. My mom says there is nothing wrong with that. So I bought these headphones so they don't fall off when I am getting my jam on. Also sometimes I get excited when I'm watching My Little Pony in the car when my wife is driving and tend to move my head around a lot. Traditional headphone that people my age would wear would typically fall off fairly easily. Plus when I'm listening to music, the sound quality is fantastic. The bass and treble levels are outstanding and equally balanced. So I urge you to give these headphones a try. When you get them, don't hesitate to pop in a good New Kids on the Block or MC Hammer tape in the Walkman and hear the amazing sound!"
5,WOW! THESE ARE UNDESTRUCTIBLE,"This headphones are marvelous!. I bought them for my 2 yr old daughter and she loves them. I do not know what is with children but the bear face does something to them. She used them for the first time on the plane and worked perfect. I tried them too just to check if they worked fine. They are flexible and soft. And most important, you can hear perfect on the car and even on the plane (before and after taking off ofcourse).P.d I fell asleep and a few min later I realize my daughter took the ear pads off!. I was so upset because they where brand new. She tried to chew on them but this time.. without succes!. I put them back together (I sweat a little bit) and looked like if nothing ever happend to them. I am still excited!."
1,Cheaply made,"These headphones, while very cute and comfortable for my son, are a piece of junk. We purchased the Bear headphones and the ears fell off with the first use. They were still functional so I decided not to return them. Then, after only a couple of weeks of use the cord frayed near the volume control and they no longer work."
3,Just ok.,"I bought these last year for my girls for our big vacation road trip. They complained that they hurt their ears, but continued to wear them because that was the only way they could hear their movies. The rubber gaskets that cover their ears eventually started popping off & are a pain to put back on. For the price, they were worth it, but now I'm going for new ones this year that will actually last."
1,These do not work on our iPad,"There is no sound at all, returning them immediately. Very cute though, my three year old loved the look of them."
1,Poor quality,We bought three of these headsets for our kids. One was broken out of the box and a second pair stopped working halfway into a road trip. Now the kids use them as toys. Do not buy.
2,Deleted Scene - ** Stars,"Wolfen is a rare werewolf movie that isn't all Hollywood hokum. This absorbing and suspenseful movie makes a strong social commentary about how much we know and asks the question which race is truly superior.If you're looking for the traditional werewolf movie, Wolfen is not it. If you're looking for a well made suspense drama with great special effects, Wolfen is a 4 Star movie to see.Wolfen is a beautifully transferred DVD that has great picture quality - the only problem is that Wolfen has a deleted scene in the bar with singer Tom Waits.Are studios so in a rush to make a buck that they are deleting scenes, leaving out sub-titles and essential dubbing? What's the point in owning a good looking disc with missing movie parts? A shocker from Warner and a red flag to the other major studios who think that DVD collectors don't notice such omissions."
3,Wolfen,"Good movie but not the best Werewolf movie,more drama than horror and with a social message. I want to see Werewolves Not Real Wolves! I am more of An American Werewolf In London Fan."
3,Great 2/3rds of the way.,"Good gore, awesome cinematography (the point of view of the wolfen is astoundingly frightful), and one of Albert Finney's best performances (not to mention Gregory Hines' fine support) is done in by an incoherent ending that panders to Native Americans. Yes we know they've been wronged (let's support Indian gambling instead), but the horror value of this film (and the mystery it manages to build) is thrown out the window when the all-too-literal wrap-up is presented. Edward James Olsmos' character, and the heavy handed Native American subplot, seem totally out of place amid the originality of the rest of this, one of the finest horror films I've seen. It's definately worth watching, but that ending is really hard to swallow in my book."
3,NOT a horror movie at all!,"Well then, the first thing you'll notice about Wolfen, is that It Is far from being a horror, werewolf movie, the pace sometimes is there, but the rest....... The ending is laughable, unfortunately. I could only recommend this movie for the completists, as It Is kind of boring sometimes. If you are really into werewolves, go for An American werewolf in London, or even The Howling (The special effects are pretty poor sometimes, contrasting with some brilliant moments). If you are NOT into werewolves movies you'll also find this review helpful as It makes you give It a try. The bottom line is, I wouldn't want to be fooled purchasing or renting a film which boasts a werewolf on the cover that has nothing to do with the real plotand It Is nowhere to be seen. People really into werewolves movies will be dissapointed in It, that's for sure."
2,Some reviewers are too generous.,"""They can track you by yesterday's shadow, they can hear a cloud passing overhead.""I saw this when it first came out in theaters and again years later. My opinion of the film did not change much. It was kind of interesting in concept, but had one central problem; Finney was a miscast.I have enjoyed Albert Finney in some of his other roles, and perhaps his work since Wolfen might be coloring some folks' take on this movie. But he is most certainly in the wrong part here. Which is too bad because I can still remember some of the film, so what's that say??""Their world is more complete."""
2,Read The Book Instead,"As much as I would like to say this was a great horror movie, it, unfortunately, falls far short of the potential of the genuine feeling of fear created by the book it was based on. I have no objection to the actors, they all did a good job with the script they were given, and the adaption was even acceptable. My major problem with this movie wasin the use of GERMAN SHEPARDS, for god's sake, to represent the canine equivalent of man on the evolutionary scale. The whole point of the story was that a branch of canines had evolved as far as man had evolved from apes, and had kept themselves hidden from mankind for all these years, feeding on the weak and the sick among us, never allowing themselves to be discovered except in the legends of werewolves and devils of the night. Tn the book, it was presented as though it were both possible and likely. In the moviy, the wolfen were no more frightning than a pack of feral dogs hanging around a city dump."
2,big bad wolfen,"i have to say i had high hopes for this flick. was i totally let down. while i liked the wolves killing people, i did not like how they added a indian type of theme to it. not my cup of tea. if you like werewolf movies and thinking that what you are going to get out of this one, don't buy it."
1,WHAT A JOKE!,I ordered a NEW copy of this movie and received an old copy. The box still had the original tape on it and these people just wrapped an old SCRATCHED disc up and tried to pass it off as new. I did get a refund but it still does not excuse the stunt that they pulled! WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THESE RIP-OFF artists again.
1,0 STARS: A very odd and boring movie,"The movie ""Wolfen"" is very odd and boring. I did not like this movie. I did not think this movie was scary at all. I thought the wolf creatures looked pretty benign and I also thought the plot and storyline were pretty lame. I don't recommend this flick because this movie is just plain sorry. In fact, this movie is hardly worth a review other than to say that it stinks. I HATE IT."
3,jesus beats the devil,a pretty decent horror movie i'm not munch of a horror fan but once in a while i like to be starteld the plot and evrything was pretty weired it was a o.k. movie but i love religuis [bad spelling sorry]movies better especely the passion of the christ!
5,Almost new,"I always order my son book every year from Amazon, they have great prices and my son is happy. Is always good to have extra books at home"
1,Not So Pleased,"I ordered this book for my son for homeschooling. It arrived early which was wonderful. However, when we took it out of the box, it was dirty and the cover was damage a lot. I was not pleased at all."
4,hovercraft remote control,We received this item damaged. Contacted the seller & they were very promt to send a replacement & information on returning damaged product. Very happy with the service. Will order from this person again.
3,Better for learning than pleasure reading,"I already owned ""How any Animals"" in the I am Reading Latin series, and I liked it-- simple Latin (one-two words per page) and pleasant illustrations-- I thought it simple enough to use with a one-year old. This book, however, seems more suited to elem. school age kids. Also, I thought it would be more ""Mommy loves me, Daddy loves me,"" etc., but it tries to be a little clever and ends up being silly (i.e., Mother comes in carrying groceries and asks for help in Latin that is anything but classical). I like this book least out of the series. The illustrations are not very good."
1,golf lessons,"Very disappointed. Didn't care for the format nor the way the book's core was telling how three different random players (A,B,C) would play a particular hole on a particular course."
1,not what I expected,"This follows dance items suggested by Tanjavore quartret strictly and that is the oly good thing I can say about this. It is not what I expected. A good dancer is graceful, has no wasted movements. Dancer in the dvd lacks both. Also sometimes music and the adavus are mismatched, especially in faster kalas. Of mediocre standard."
5,Excellent collection,Here is an excellent collection of Bharatanatyam songs for students who are preparing for an Arangetram or are learning the dance from a teacher. Generally students in either of the aforementioned categories use poor audio compilations of the songs to prepare for their momentous day ! This CD can be used for Arangetram in lieu of a live band and it is moderately priced. Audio recording is very good.The artists rendition of songs was authentic as well as modern. I found myself humming the tunes after a few days of listening to these songs.
5,Beck Arnley 087-1707 Semi-Metallic Brake Pads,"Fits perfectly on hyundai elantra 2004. I did not experience any issues with this pads. The price is very competitive. I don't know how long they will last, but look quite sturdy."
5,Great Tool,Amazon suggested buying this tool by their system that suggests similar items as you shop. I had been considering this type of ring compressor for a while. It arrived in a couple of days and I used it a day later. Worked great on the little Cosworth Ford engine I'm rebuilding. I have to thank Amazon for suggesting it.
4,lisle piston ring compressor,"This ring compressor is simple to use, but a little clumsy when you get oil on it. but there's not much to be done about that. it worked adequitely."
1,doesn't work properly at all,The band is way to stiff and the collection band has too much slack and lets the ring band tilt causing damage to the rings.
5,Great folklore from Maine,Interesting history of the men and times in easterm Maine at the turn of the century when game laws came on the scene.
5,Black's last GREAT album!,"This is without question one Stanley Black's greatest albums. Recorded in 1979 with the then new technology, it has only 10 cuts, but it can be argued, that this is the most satisfying Black album ever. With new tunes of the 1970's and an outstanding arrangement of Herb Alpert's Rise, this makes for a winner. In fact, Black's version of Rise is superior. It is an outstanding arrangement for piano and orchestra. Another great cut is Tomorrow from Annie. This is without question the greatest arrangement of this musical tune ever recorded. I dare any other artist to match brilliance of this arrangement. I say that this is Black's last great album because the next year, Mantovani would pass away and Black would take over his orchestra. If you like Stanley Black, then do yourself a favor and purchase this outstanding album. It will please you for years to come. I still have my original LP! It's great to have this album back in circulation again."
2,Disapointment....I'll try another brand.,"This being my first silicone cookware purchase, I suppose I still knew that not all pans would perform identically or spectacularly.That being said, I did put some sort of confidence when I purchased KitchenAid's product rather than the 200 plus ""never-heard-of"" brands or infomercial brands that have recently sprouted up everywhere. Misplaced confidence, as it were. This pan has shown itself to be easily cleaned afterwards, but certainly not Non-stick by any stretch of the imagination when it comes to retrieving the baked goods. The brownie doesn't simply ""pop"" out unscathed. The typical layer of cake residue is left behind just the same as in a metal cake pan. So, aside from being able to squeeze it into a cabinet nook, the results I expected from a silicone cake pan just haven't, ahem...panned out.Eventually, I will be trying another silicone pan. This time I'll look for a glossier version, and one that isn't made by KitchenAid."
1,"Nasty smell, doesn't cook very well","We bought one to cook brownies. We have used it twice. Both times the smell in the house was like burning rubber. Very harsh. The brownies did not cook very well. They did not cook as well as they do in traditional pans. I had to give this away. I't give it zero stars if that were available since it is unusable. I also did notice that it did not clean very well, but that was the least of our problems."
3,Good For What It Was Made For,"It's a good item for what it was made for, but not for what I bought it for."
3,Blimey it's Limey,"Big Ben in Britain, okay, what's the deal? Not the best, but has its moments. The band isn't all-star, especially the couple of tracks with the organist rather than the pianist; and the tracks aren't properly noted on the disc nor the cover notes on my copy, but there is some merit here for Webster aficianados. Some good blowing for his advanced age & health; but for completists, as they say, after you've got the other many fine CD's of his. The recording quality is good, but the band plays it straight; so fans of a looser approach may not care for the style at such a late date (1967). Some fine piano & bass as well as tight drumming, and a nice mellow rendition of ""Solitude"" for fans of the Ben ballad stylings."
4,Jazzy fun,"This is a nice collection of Beatles songs, arranged in a jazz style. It's moderately hard and fun to play, with unusual chords and modulation."
2,Cable is too short,"Cable is too short, when the fire starts if I dont watch it and remove it fast the electrical cable will melt. they have to put a longer cable on this."
4,"Its hot, fast and cheap","Good starter, works as expected and costs a lot less than the BGE version which it replaced. Well packaged and looks like it will last if it isn't abused."
5,Better than Charcoal Chimneys and anything else,In my area this is alot of wind(since i live close to the windy city chi) so everytime i get some kind of fire going the charcoal wont light. I tried the charcoal chimney and paid 15 bucks for it and it did nothing for me. So after trying for 2 hours to light using that dumb chimney I borrowed one of these wands from my mother and in 5 minutes the charcoal started smoking. This the best starter for a barbeque hands down.
3,Lasted not even a year,"Had another product prior to this one that lasted several years. This one, not even 6 months. My husband uses it to light the coals until there's flame. Maybe he's leaving it on too long, I don't know. The element broke into 3 pieces after less than 50 uses. Overall, though, I like the product. I much prefer to start my grill this way than with lighter fluid."
5,CharcoalGrillers-Must have,"This thing is awesome. Does what it says, no bells, whistles or switches. Just plug it in and within 5 minutes, your fire is ready! The only thing is you need a extension cord and it could use a resting cradle for cooling. Otherwise I love it."
1,Bad... REALLY bad.,"So I bought this starter in May and 8 months later, it broke right in the middle. It's defective and now it's out of warranty. I may be SOL but that doesn't mean you should be. Move on people! There must be better products out there."
2,waaay too much for shipping,Shipping is almost as much as the starter. I think I'll stick with the chimney that's eligible for free shipping.
2,Poor design,The product is difficult to use in a Weber charcoal unit. no curve in the hndle to allow the heating element to be flat on top of the coals.
5,SO HANDY AND EASY,"LIQUID LIGHTER FLUID MAKES THE MEAT TASTE LIKE, WELL, LIQUID LIGHTER FLUID. THIS THING IS FAST, NO FLAME UPS, COALS ARE READY SO QUICK.."
3,Overrated,"We use nothing but real charcoal (no briquets), and previously used a huge gas flame to light the coals, as we do not like the smell or taste of liquid fire-starters. This product DOES work, but slowly. It's just like starting a camp fire. You have to tend to it, blow on the coals, etc. Not as fast and efficient as we were hoping."
3,electric charcoal starter,"these are under 10 bucks at Lowes, seems like I can find better deals locally on many items in the charcoaling area. What is up with that?"
5,beats charcoal starter,no chemical on my food! This electric starter is so easy to use and lights the charcoals in minutes. Perfect alternative to pouring chemicals over the coals!
1,Cheaply made with cheap maetrial,I read the reviews and thought I would give this a try and ordered a bone one. I was so disappointed when I received it. The materail was thin cheap plastic that started to discolor/yellow after a few weeks even when not using it. The design was good but not the material and the super thin lining and it looked cheap on the outside. Not worth the price. I do not know about other colors but for sure would not recommend this bone.
1,"James, Call Your Attorneys","The earlier review is correct. No liner notes, complete deception. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,WTF ? this is bad,"Luckily I got this in a bargain bin at store closing and did not pay much -- It is not James. Another reviewer suggests this is some old ""Flying Machine"" resrdings. Hard to say, but this IS NOT a James Taylor album. Not bad music, not great, but NOT JT. Buyer Beware !"
2,the letter james taylor,"Contrary to several other reviews, some of these cuts have James Taylor on vocals...I remember this being a part of ""James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine"" which I still have on scratchy vinyl from 1971. None of this is to say it is particularly good; rather, its simply early recordings that would have been set aside had James Taylor not achieved the success he has."
5,Wow!,"This book tells a beatiful story of man and son. it describes how a middle aged boy feels, when he is embarrased by his father being the janitor.Read Up!"
3,The Janitors Boy Rating Response,I enjoyed this particular book. It really gave me the point of view of a boy in this boy's situation. I thought it was a very realistic book. I recommend this to everyone.
4,Heartwarming,"The Janitor's Boy is a classic Andrew Clements school story about real people. In almost every young person's life, there comes a time when their parents become more than 2-dimensional objects. Jack is embarrassed because his father is the school janitor. But soon Jack will learn that there's more to a person than what they do for a living.One day, his father says hello to him in class and the other kids really start in on the teasing. Jack retaliates against his father by putting a huge mound of gum under a desk. The plan backfires and Jack's punishment is to work with as a janitor cleaning off the gum under desks for 3 weeks after school.In that time, Jack learns a lot about his father and the work that he does. It's more than just a learn it by walking in his shoes story, though. Jack and his father have time to communicate and Jack might even find that they have more in common than he wanted or expected.A good book about real people."
3,"What I Think Of ""The Janitor's Boy""","I read the book ""The Janitor's Boy"" by Andrew Clements. The whole book was very interesting but the part I liked the most would have to be the overall point of the story or the theme.The part I disliked would have to be Jack's(the main character's) attitude towards his father.The best part of the book was the beginning of the story.It was such a great opening to the story.It gave me the background of the story.The worst part of the book would have to be the ending. It came to a sudden questioning end.I don't like books that leave me hanging in the air.The two story elements that were the most vivid to me would have to be the characters and the conflict.The author did such a great job of describing the characters and the conflict.He gave the characters a personality of their own.The author especially did a great job of describing Jack's feeeling towards his father's job."
2,The Janitor's Boy,"The Janitor's Boy was alright.I gave it two stars because it was not real exciting like I expected and was kind of boring.I would not recomend it to someone else.It is about this kid named Jack Rankin that has to be janitor for 3 weeks for stiking gum under a music desk. While he is on Gum Patrol,he finds a cabinet full of keys then picks out 2 keys,one to the Bell Tower and the other one goes to the Steamroom.Jack then explores both places and gets to know his dad more at the same time."
5,Baldurs Gate 2,"I have been an avid gamer for 20+ years and have never before experienced a computer product as detailed and engrossing as this.Its amazing to me that Black Isle/Interplay were able to not only incorporate all of the D+D rules, characters, classes, items etc. but they also gave us that D+D ""feel"" that those of us who have played pencil and paper style with d20s lying around know what im talking about. Even if your new to the genre i'd strongly recommend this product. And for all you vets out there this comes from one hardliner to another: GO BUY THIS GAME!"
5,The best RPG Ever!,"This game is by far the best so far. Icewind Dale was a little weak on the storyline, and Baldur's Gate (even though it was a blast to play as well) just had to many little annoying things. This game is a one I could play over and over again without getting bored. The character creation is great, the story line is even better, and the new graphics are awesome! I bought the Collector's Edition because the extra items are a definate perk. I suggest to anyone who plays RPG's and likes them to buy this game as soon as possible, you won't regret it! It's as close to perfect as you'll get."
5,Best Toy Ever,"When my daughter went to the Dr. for her 3 month check up, she was not reaching for toys. I decided to buy this gym to help her learn to reach for things. It worked! Within 2 weeks she was reaching and swatting at the toys. My daughter is now six months old and she still loves this toy. This gym is expensive and I felt guilty when I bought it, but we have definitely received our money's worth. Have fun!!"
5,"fun,fun,fun",my infant daughter loves it - the colors are bright and exciting - no sharp edges to scratch - machine washable!!!
3,My friend breathed new life into this one...,"My baby had played with this a little bit, but loses interest to fast. By the time she was 5 or 6 months old and could sit up and crawl she was onto bigger and better things. I was packing it up for good when my friend suggested tenting it. She did this with her son and got months and months more use out of it. We covered it with a light blanket. Now I cannot keep her out of it. She drags other toys in there with her. Its her secret hiding place. Its great to watch her little imagination going wild. She is now almost a year old and still loves it."
5,Very Fun,This was just a great toy for all of my children. All three of them enjoyed laying under it and looking at the toys hanging down and batting at the toys.I particularly liked that it was very low key. It didn't have flashing lights and noises and music every time the baby moved. It was just a nice toy.It was easy to clean and held up to three children playing with it. The colors didn't fade and the toys lasted a long time.Enjoy. well worth the money.
3,i bought this item BECAREFUL,"ONE OF THE RATTLES ON THIS ITEM HAS A HOLE WITH A SCREW IN IT. MY DAUGHTER A 6 MONTH OLD BUSTED HER LIP PRETTY BAD FROM THIS. DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD PULL THIS RING OFF AND PUT IT INTO THEIR MOUTH. I THREW THAT PIECE IN THE TRASH. OVERALL MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS GYM. PLEASE BECAREFUL. THANKS, A CONCERNED MOTHER"
5,My daughter is 8 months old and still loves it!!!,"I started using the gymini when my daughter was just a few days old and she loved looking up at the animals. It was great for when she was 2 months old and discovered that she could control her hands, it was even better when she could actually play and pull at them. I used it for tummy time and she loved looking at the colors on the mat. Now she is crawling and sitting up and still loves to play on it and tug at the animals. I definitely have gotten more than my money's worth out of this toy!"
3,Son wasnt into it but the CATS loved it,"As soon as I found out I was pregnant I rushed out and bought this toy for my son. Troughout his first year I pulled it out and tried to get him to play with it but he never really liked it, My cats on the other hand were enthralled with the hanging toys and played with it much more than my son did. After my son turned 1 (he is 15 mos now)I took the toy apart and used the mat as a rug by his toy box and took the toys off it and left them for my son to play with, he seemed to like it much more that way."
3,"Too Soon, Maybe?","I've used this on my daughter since birth. She didn't take interest or like it until after one month. Now that she is 2 months, she only likes staring into the mirror. Nothing else on this mat interests her. She bats at some of the objects, but I think accidentally. Perhaps she will like it more when she is 3 months and can start grabbing."
4,Bobby's mom,My 7 week old son loves this toy! He lays under it and smiles and kicks away!!!! One of the toys even plays a little music. It's quite entertaining to him and I enjoy the play time with him when we are using this gymini.
5,One of the best items purchased!,I would definately reccomend this item! Our four month old loves this and has used it since he was about one month old. He can lay under it for hours at a time and it entertained! I have gone out and bought a few more of the toys that you can add on there and they are great as well. We bought him chimes that he can kick and he loves making music! It also is easy to take apart and clean which is great if he spits up on it. It travels fairly well also. This is a great item to buy and definatley worth the money.
5,Wonderful Toy!!!,"I am so glad that I spent the extra money for this Gymini instead of purchasing another, cheaper one. This was so mcuh fun for my son. He started to show interest in it around two months of age, and he is almost five months old and still loves to stare at all of the colorful toys that come with it. He becomes a wild man if he is on his back kicking and batting the toys. It is so mcuh fun to watch. We take frequent car trips to relatives' homes, and it is really easy to fold in half and pack in the car. I love it!!!"
5,One of our favorites!,"I really like this playmat. My daughter played with it for HOURS at a time when we got it. It is really great because it has several toys that come with it (the mirror turtle being her favorite one), plus you have endless possiblilties in toys you can add on to it.I did have a problem with the sea horse, because after just a few times of playing, it quit working. I called the customer service number and they replaced it for free with no hassles whatsoever. And the representative was very friendly too (which is rare among the customer service departments I have ever dealt with)My only problem with the actual mat (and the reason I didn't give it all 5 stars) is because after one time of washing it, the red around the edges and in the pictures faded a LOT.Overall, though this is a great toy, and I know that if she wasn't too big for it now, my daughter would still be playing with it to this day!"
4,gotta have it,"This is great. I love being able to change the toys around, add more, and keep her thinking. She's only two months old, so she only lasts 15-20 minutes at a time, but I can tell she's learning from it! She loves the mirror and the whale! And I think her dad has as much fun with it (and her) as she does."
5,Worth the extra money!!,"My two month old son absolutely loves this playmat. We chose this one for several reasons: 1) the hanging animals actually face him- he sees more than just the seam; 2) the mat is bright and fun, and there are even two flaps that crinkle and squeek; and 3) the mat is square rather than long and narrow.My son took to this immediately, but it may be a good idea to take off some of the toys before putting your child under it for the first time. He seemed a bit overwhelmed the very first time we used it. The toys are easily removed, and their position can be changed. You can also buy additional toys if you wish. I have also been pleased that the mat is rather thick and seems to be comfortable.This product is definitely worth the extra money."
3,Kinda Ok.,"My Little brother had this toy. He loved it when he was about a month old and started really playing with it. he became less as he got older, and when he was walking, he would try to use it for support, it didn't hold so he fell A LOT! It's nice that the toys come off because he is now almost 3 three and there are toys from it all over the place. It did last though, but I think it's to expensive."
3,"It's the space, not the toys","The best part about this toy is that it forces you to clear out a bit of space in the playroom. I mean, I get tired of tripping over toys as much as the next parent, but I'm far too lazy to clean them up.Then your relatives buy this toy for you and you think, ""hey, maybe my infant would enjoy this"". Which is a good thing, because if you yourself enjoyed it, I'd start to wonder.But of course the playroom floor is a mess, so you have to make room, which then devolves into actually *putting toys where they belong*. Gasp. And before you know it, the playroom is clean for the first time in weeks, the kid is screaming because she's being ignored, and you're ready to lay out this playmat.And so you do. And she bats at the toys for a minute or so. And then she gets bored. Or hungry. Or both.But, hey, at least the playroom is clean."
4,Wish I'd had it a little sooner!,"A gift of money received when my daughter was 3 months old was well spent on Tiny Love Gymini. After looking over several other similar playmats at the store I settled on this one. I liked the Noah's ark motif (my husband and I did question their choice of animals?!), bright colors yet still has a fun-childlike design , integrated mat toys and ability to add more toys. My daughter liked batting at the hanging toys, squeaker, and crinkler. Crinkler was her favorite! She enjoyed it everyday. It washed up easily, although the crinkler wasn't as loud after a few washings and the colors faded a little. When she was able to sit up, detaching the toys for play and using the mat without the arches (even when she began crawling) gave it an even longer ""life"". Great developmental toy. You won't be disappointed."
5,A great starter toy,"We received this playmat when our daughter was a newborn. It was an instant hit. Our daughter loved looking at the hanging toys (mirror included)when she was itty-bitty, and now at almost 5 months, she loves grabbing and yanking on them. The toys detatch from the arcs and are light and soft, so she can pick them up and move them around easily. The mat itself has colorful pictures and textures, which are fun for tummy time. We actually got two of these as gifts and kept them both she loved them so much. We keep one in the car so she can stretch out and play when we visit other people's homes. One other big plus-the mat washes well and gets softer and softer. A definite must have for young babies."
2,a bad installment in a great series,"The Bluffer's guides are a well-written, funny and informative bunch of pamphlets. I read five of them cover to cover while waiting for a friend in a bookshop, and I must say that this one was the weak link in the chain. It has (like the others) wit and irreverence, but it lacks the precision and hard facts that the guides to wine, ballet, jazz, and others have. In short, this book might be of mild humor to folks who actually are consultants, but as a ``bluffer's guide'' it fails."
4,Hilarious,"The Knable are a Seattle couple which husband Roy(Ritter) has a lousy job and all the time he is watching Tv.His wife fed up with his behaviour and the new Tv system he buys left him alone and when his wife was about to destroy the satellite dish they are sucked by the dish and transported to a world of the Hellvision.A world of Tv with the risk of being eliminated if they loose.So they must escape and change from the different channels until they spent 24 hours.If they survive,they'll find salvation.Contains a lot of Tv parody as well the Salt'n Pepa Hit Start me up.I enjoyed it a lot."
2,RIP TO John Ritter,first like alot of folks I know I was Stunned by the sudden passing of John Ritter.I have always Been a Big Fan of His.this film was pretty basic but thanks to John Ritter it had some real funny moments.it was corny in spots but John Ritter saved it as He usually did whenever he was Performing.He had that Gift.the film is pretty average but John Ritter made it worth seeing.
2,"Ok, but not so good",The movie is ok but I would not advise you to see it if you want a movie with a well written script.
3,It's all right,This is an okay movie. John Ritter is funny as always and is forever missed. It is worth a view.
3,3 of 5,"A TV addict gets sucked into the world of television. It's an ironic concept with a lot of creative potential. But placing the couch potato protagonist; in this case, a pumbing salesman named Roy; and his wife on the set of popular TV shows could cause legal trouble in the way of copyright infringement. So it's all done in parody; which, in the US, is generally exempt from the law; but with a Hellish slant. And, as black comedy, it works, at-least in theory. The spoofs are consistently funny. This is a movie packed with clever satire. Some of it is downright brilliant. It's the actual plotting, which gets the couple's kids involved in trying to save them; à la Poltergeist; that could use some work.marcellee.com"
3,"Not Bad, but not that good",This movie is ok... it's not really suspensful and it doesn't surprise you. If you want to see this movie I would suggest buying it used or renting it because it is not worth the full value.The only reason I bought it was because George Gray is in the credits and I am a loyal fan.
4,Undrated Comedy,"I never knew this movie even existed until a few years ago when I found it on DVD. John Ritter and Jeffrey Jones are hilarious in it. The premise is clever, but there are a few plot holes here and there. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed the movie mostly because of the parodies of Three's Company, Married with Children, and the six-minute Rooney Tunes animated by Chuck Jones."
3,"666 channels is a ""hell"" of a lot","Roy Knable (John Ritter) ""Real men ""(1987), is a plumbing supplies salesman and he does not like his job. So he buries himself in TV. His wife Helen (Pam Dawber) thinks he is not a doer anymore and he is not fun. He just will not talk to her during double overtime.Spike (Jeffery Jones), you may recognize him as the principal in ""Farris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986), recognizes a soul snatching opportunity when he sees one. He offers Roy 666 channels that are not seen on regular TV. The creators of this movie were real creative with the channel selection.Surprise Roy & Helen are drawn into TV land where they are destined to wander from channel to channel until they learn a little about themselves and each other. Spike is sort of hoping to bump them off in one of several ways before 24 hours is up.Will Spike have his way?Will Roy realize the error of his ways?Will Helen get blown up and ran over?Stay tuned."
5,Antinomy: A union of mind,"A purchased this book thinking I needed it for a class, but I didn't so when I asked the seller if I could cancel my order they canceled it without a problem."
3,"Nice looks, weak construction","The frame has a pretty appearance. However, the inside levels are made of thin card type paper, and are weakly assembled. This makes it difficult to position the picture correctly; the whole thing remains wobbly until the back lid is in its place. Then the picture looks very nice."
1,Terrible,I bought this product because I had been told that silicone was the way to go. I have had nothing but problems. My first batch of muffins did not rise. The pan sent off this weird bluish smoke that filled my house. The muffins did not want to come out of the pan. The next 2 batches of muffins were burned on the bottom and not finished on top. I have a garage sale muffin pan that works better. I will be dumping this pan in the garbage.
2,Ew! Whats that SMELL??,"I got this as a gift last Christmas, and mine also came with a metal holder. The problem with the holder is that the pan doesnt sit evenly on top, so the muffins on the sides come out lopsided-if they come out at all.Call me lazy, but after using this I threw it in the dishwasher and found out that the non-stick spray will not wash off, instead it creates a sticky mess that I still havent been able to remove from the pan.By far though, the WORST part of this thing is the nasty smell that floods my house when Im baking. Its so toxic smelling, Its hard to want to eat after pulling it out of the oven.On the upside though, the muffin pan is not nearly as awful as the KitchenAid silicone baking mat."
5,Great item,"So pliable that you must hold on with two hands or you can spill all the batter on the floor,stove, foot and everywhere if you aren't carefull. Easy clean up."
2,Doesn't meet expectations :(,"I was very excited to see that several silicone items were being made by kitchen-aid, given their product history. I used to work in the food industry and silicone baking mats were indespensible to us. However, this is NOT the same stuff. As the other reviewer said, it produces a rubbery smell when baking (not appetizing, and not like commercial silicone mats) AND my muffins stuck to the pan like glue. If I have to use nonstick spray to prevent sticking, I'll just use my old metal muffin tin.Unfortunately I waited til more than 30 days after I purchased it to give it a try, and now I can't even return it. At least it was cheap when I bought it.If you want some silicone bakeware stick to silpat or matfer baking mats for now. They are great. As for formed bakeware, don't purchase these.I give the product 2 stars because it makes items in a muffin shape but doesn't live up to product claims of non-stick, and beacause of the icky smell it makes."
1,I'll be returning this one soon!,"I bought a cheapie silicone 6-cup muffin pan at the local department store. It has a nice slick finish on it and the muffins pop right out.So, I think, it's a GOOD idea to buy a KitchenAid 12-cup - because after all KA makes great stuff, right? WRONG on this one!Whoever thought it was a good idea to put a TEXTURED FINISH on this thing needs to think again - the muffins stuck in it just as badly as they stuck in my old metal pans - tried it the second time using nonstick cooking spray and that didn't help either!Don't bother with this one. Find one with a slick finish!"
1,Horrible Purchase,"Could of purchased the book from the Josephson website for 12.95 instead of the 40 plus I payed here. Next time, I'll check further into it."
1,poor quality control,"I ordered a set of 4 qnd 2 are not functional. I do not recommend these at all. The worst solar priduct i have used. Of course Amaxon suggests i contact the manufacturer since they just host the seller.I have contacted the seller, more to follow"
1,$107.00?????? At least KISS us too...,"Three years ago these were all over for under $30 for four pieces - and they WORKED WELL.Now the price has DOUBLED AND TRIPLED (PLUS!!!) and many of these are simply OLD, JUNK STOCK with their ***NON-REPLACEABLE BATTERIES*** DEAD OR DYING. Many are not sealed properly allowing water leakage and/or moisture to condense inside the totally sealed units. (If you're thinking of replacing the batteries - DON'T.)These are heavy solid, molded bases into which the end lights are inserted and glued from the inside, then the top solar panel is glued with heavy duty adhesive and set into the top effectively locking ALL ACCESS OUT FROM INSIDE. (IF YOU'RE THINKING ""DREMMEL TOOL"" - GOOOOOOOOOD LUCK!!!)There is a VERY, VERY GOOD REASON FOR ALL THESE ""1 STAR"" RATINGS.THESE ARE JUNK!!! AND AT ROYAL RIP PRICES TO BOOT. STEER CLEAR, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!$107.00??? YEAH. RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT..."
1,POOR!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,Harbor Freight has basically the same product for $39.99. Quality is SUPER poor~~~about 40-50% are DOA. Made in China says it all
5,Highly recommended!,"As a school psychologist (ages 4 - 13), I have been looking for a book like this for years! It's much more elaborate than the standard books on child development and it's based on the latest research rather than on theories. It provides me with a rich fund of information that I use when assessing a child, especially younger children with social or emotional issues.One thing that appeals to me in this book, is the emphasis on psychological processes. Diagnoses like ADHD are briefly discussed but Davies explains also how for example an environmentally based language delay can lead to problems with impulsivity.Highly recommended!"
4,Very good soup,"Wolfgang's New England Clam Chowder is very good, but runs quite short of clams in it. The soup tastes great when a can of minced or diced clams and a little pepper are added."
1,the worst soup ever,"why would a famous chef want to attach his name to this tasteless slop? Tasted it; could not eat it; and it went in the toilet. there was no hint of clam taste whatsoever; the texture was slimey, not creamy."
3,Not as good as other products,"This is okay. It has a nice flavor, but is not as rich and creamy asCampbells Chunky New England Clam Chowder, 10.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12), which I enjoyed more. I suppose it does depend on your taste. This soup as a stronger bacon and clam flavor while Chunky is much more clams and lots of cream. I enjoyed it, but probably won't buy it again. If I'm going to eat something as fattening as Clam Chowder I want it to be very creamy."
2,Pasty and not much clam flavor,"I really wanted to like this... I really enjoy Wolfgang Puck's French Onion Soup, and I love good New England Clam Chowder... but this ain't it! It is thick and pasty and really doesn't taste of either cream or clams... and is a little salty to boot.I think Progresso makes a much better product in this soup... heck, even Campbell's beats out WP's version in my opinion."
4,Fine as canned soup,"I like the convenience, low sodium, and low fat (relatively speaking). The taste is better than average for canned soup but don't expect more than that."
3,good but not great,I purchased this soup based upon the reviews I read on this page. The soup is good but not as creamy as I would like. Adding a little cream to the pot when heating adds a lot.
4,I love all Piesman's novels.,"Though perhaps it isn't Piesman's best mystery, Close Quarters is completely enjoyable. I love Nina Fischman, her mother, her relatives and friends. This series is hysterically funny. I can read them again and again."
2,More Bridget Jones than Agatha Christie,"I gave this book two stars because I did like Nina Fischman and her outlook on life. Other than that, it's one of the worst ""mysteries"" I've ever read. Almost no sleuthing goes on until about 85% of the way through, and then the killer gives up himself/herself in a Scooby-Doo-type pat ending.No twist; no surprise, really.Most of the novel is just Nina talking about men and her weight and her Jewishness. Perhaps this would be better read as a Bridget Jones's Diary."
1,The VERY WORST mystery ??I have ever read.,"A neurotic 40 year old New York Jewess explores all hers & acquaintances neuroses badly. Since I am a well adjusted older protestant from California, it leaves me absolutely cold! The murder & solving of it are secondary to all of the introspection which is juvenile."
1,Avoid at all costs,"The one-star rating isn't for Warren's book, which is necessary reading for anyone interested in the history of psychology, but for the shoddy reprint offered by Kessinger. I'm a bit shocked that Amazon would even sell this product: not only is the facsimile made from a book with handwriting and marginal marks in it, but the majority of the pages are illegible. There are dark diagonal lines across these pages, the print is blurred, and the pages themselves -- because of the diagonal lines -- are nearly as dark as the print. If you hold the book at an angle, you can just barely make out most of the words, but that's hardly a reading experience worth paying for. Read Warren's book, but don't throw away your money on this copy. I'm returning mine."
5,Good book - stupid reviews,"This book is an excellent, useful and highly unusual collection of ""primary documents"" - it shows the ubiquity of racist thinking through much of American history, an oppressive mindset from which we are, hopefully, starting to emerge. The other reviews on this page are stupid and disturbing. The kind of praise that they make of these texts would be like reading a collection of medieval writing and commenting on how they are an ""inspirational breath of fresh air"" because they legitimate the idea that the world is flat."
4,Good but Outdated,"I do not own a PSOne but I played it at my friend's house for a long time. I must say that it is a very good system considering the price and games. The graphics are really bad but gameplay is all that matters with older systems. It truly is a great system, but not when it is compared to SEGA's Dreamcast. The controller is good and so are some of the games. But Sony is about to pull the plug of the PSOne. But hey, for fifty bucks you can't go wrong with the PSOne, unless of course you want a 128 bit cansole for the same price tag!I hope that this review was helpful to you!"
5,For a new gamer or a person on a budget that wants pure fun!,Okay This is a console for the gamer on a budget.If you are looking for a console to keep you or your kids occupied and you are on a budget you should buy this.This is what you get with the console1 SONY PLAYSTATION CONSOLE1 DUAL SHOCK CONTROLLER (THE CONTROLLER)1 POWER CORD1 A/V CORD (THE CORD THAT YOU PLUG INTO YOUR TV)and here is a list of the stuff you should buy with it1)An extra controller -$14.992)2 Memory Cards-$9.99 for 1 or $20 for 2 your choice3)and games1)Metal Gear Solid2)crash Bandicoot 33)Ape Escape4)Driver5)Tekken 36)Final Fantasy 77)Spyro Year of the dragon8)Medal of Honor9)Crash Team Racing10)Gran Turismo 2
5,"Compact, Cute, Stylish","Mostly I play Dance Dance Revolution on my PSOne and I love it because it is so compact and stylish. I can easily pack it in my suitcase or pop it in my backpack. I have left it on for very long periods of time and have not had it overheat or cause any problems. This is my first game console since the first Sega (I'm not a huge gamer) and I love it. I haven't bought any accessories for it yet, but I've got my eye on Sony's LCD/Battery pack so I can really take it with me. I got mine used off of Amazon.com for about [price]. I haven't had any problems, they seem like very durable machines."
5,"PS2 just around the corner, why not a PSOne","I know, I know the PS2 is just around the corner. Why would you want to but something that is basically what most of us have had for years. I have a PS2 reserved and when I saw the PS One I just had to have one. The unit it small. It takes up less room, especially when you have a couple other consoles that you have to squeeze into an entertainment center. I travel a lot and this will fit into my laptop bag a lot better than the old ones. It runs pretty quiet,even though it is the same hardware just smaller. Plus I have heard that the PS2 may not be completely backwards compatiable with some RPGs. So why not pick up a PS One today."
5,This system is great!,"What type of gamer says it should be discontinued? A real gamer plays games for gameplay not GFX (Graphics) . I still play NES, SNES, Neo Geo, AND PSX (1) and Nintendo 64! And still I play the playstation 2 sometimes."
5,play station=FUN!,"PS1 may not have the best graphics, but it's a good bargain if you're looking for a cheap, and fun game console. Also, it's got great games like: Spider-Man, Gran Turismo 2, Spyro:Year of the Dragon, just to name a few. PS1'S graphics aren't bad, there just not as good as x-box or ps2. The size of a ps1 is smaller than regular ps and the games are the cheapest avalible."
5,"PSOne, Still the Best","Over the years, you would think the greatness of Playstation would have decreased. Have I got news for you! PSone is still up there fightin' with the big boys! A great little system that can store away easy and provide hours of great game play, with so many game choices available! And, maybe it's not like it's new brother, PS2, but it can play audio CD's on your TV, and has dinky little animations to go with the music. And when, in my opinion, it comes to picking PSOne over Dreamcast, I suggest the PSone blows it away!! With game choices and general setup. It's easy to hook up, and the only downside is make sure you get Memory cards, almost every game requires one! And an extra controller, especially for games like Test Drive 6. heh heh."
3,Fair: but what more can you expect from a used item,"The Playstation order came functional but had a few problems. The CD-player had troubles staying closed. Also the power button would not stay held down meaning it would keep popping back up and turning the console off. However i eventually got it to stay closed but occasionally have to put a stack of coins on top of the button to keep it on. Overall I would rate the product fair because although it had a few problems it was after all used and I knew that while purchasing, plus it still works and plays games without a problem."
2,The power cord is not the same!!,"We got a PSOne to replace and older playstation that just wore out. I wished I had know about the power cord. It is not like any other Sony power cord and you can not, at this time, order a replacement for it as Sony parts don't know what the heck you are talking about! Our kitten chewed though the power cord and so I went to order one and could not get the right one sent to us. I am now looking for the original playstation as I am not buying another one of the PSOne."
3,Review of PSOne READ THIS REVIEW!!! FOR THE TRUTH,"This is a very fun but outdated console.If you are new to gaming and low on cash,this is a great buy.BUT I MUST SAY THAT INSTEAD OF PAYING $50.00 FOR AN OUTDATED PLAYSTATION YOU CAN PAY $100.00 FOR A NEW GAMECUBE WHICH I THINK IS ONE OF THE GREATEST GAME CONSOLES EVER.So if you are looking for a longlastingfun console withquality gameschoose the gamecube.The gamecube has better graphics than the ps2 and some exclusive games whick are the best.So take my advice go with gamecube."
1,dafuq?,"Are they really trying to sell a ps1 for $600? Who would buy this, I have my old ps1 in a box somewhere that still works, maybe some sucker will buy it off me. I'm willing to sell it for half the price."
5,i had to get this--,"seeing how i was spening WAY too much time in the emergency rooms (due to sickness) and i was always on the go- i decided to spend the money and buy this- i have the LCD screen, car adaptor and found that (ever so hard to get) BATTERY PACK! (yes we drove to san bruno CA- 45 min from home to get it) and it was worth the trip- it runs on a 4 and half hr charge and it just rocks, even with my tiny collection of 15 games- gotta have the tomb raider series- and a couple of bond games- but i love it- and got what i need- i highly recommend- even of you cna find the battery pack like i did- and get a GREAT set of headphones- for those long trips!!"
3,The PS One is okay,"Okay the PS One is a ""cute"" gamesystem. It has all the features that the regular playstation. It's compatible with the regular controllers and memory cards which is a great thing to do. It also works with all playstation games. I think this would be a lot better with the LCD screen that is coming next year and the cell phone for the PS One that will get internet access to get some updates I guess. Even though it's easy to travel with and all I still recommend getting the old playstation. Because the old playstation can still do a little more things like have another port so it can take the mod chips and gameshark. AND the PS One OVERHEATS BADLY in two hours. I even had some friends who said they had to exchange it for a new one because it short circuted. The regular playstation has a fan inside the system so it wouldn't overheat. I think they PS One would be better if it also has a fan inside it."
5,SOOOOO AWESOME!,If your looking for a playstation to buy don't buy the crummy old kind get this for it is the same price but a whole lot better. It can be plugged into the T.V. and in 2001 the will have a battery and an LCD sreen so you can play on the plane or even in the car. If you already have old controllers and memory cards they will work just fine on this tiny console. So if your looking for a new playstation this is a better buy than the normal playstation.
4,listen!!,"I own this console, and I know that it is not true about psone not having ""the fan"", but somehow it does overheat. I do not know why. so if you are someone who plays alot, you might not want to get this console.if anyone knows why it overheats, PLEASE send an e-mail to------ kikim01@hotmail.com"
2,Why buy PS One?,"After reading the title you are probably thinking that I am going to tell you to buy PS2. No. I am here to tell you that this winter a product called Bleem will let you play PSOne games on Sega Dreamcast! Buy the CD, pop it in your Dreamcast and then pop in your PSOne game and play! It also inhansens the graphics (unlike PS2). So you can play 400 PSOne games and 200 Dreamcast games."
5,despite it's age it's still a lot of fun to use,"I remember my brother and sister having a PS1 years ago and I have played it a few times, now that I have my own, I can play the games from back then, like FF8 and Legend of Dragoon, it may be outdated but it doesn't mean you can't have fun with it."
3,Here's a though,Here is a thought. Why would you buy PS one now when next year it might be less and have a LCD screen. It is a waist of money. I advised to save up for PS2. I don't have it by now you won't have it for a long time. Anyways keep your money for 1 more year.
1,Disgusted gamer.,"last night i took a trip to my nearest arcade, and i saw the hottest games of today like Marvel vs capcom 2, metal slugs 3 etc. and i said to myself why the heck did i bought a Ps one, i mean i should of bought a dreamcast or Ps 2. whoever still wants a Ps one has to have all their screws loose in their head. why buy this to play old outdated games. i'm very upset over my mistake of not buying a dreamcast or PS 2. now i bought my ps one in january 2002, so at time the dreamcast was still alive so i could of bought it at the time. and PS 2 was still in it's infancy. and i went for an old ps one boy i'm i an a** to heck i will just wait for playstation 3 to come in 2005, if my parents don't tax me on what little money i have before then."
1,I have a question,Hi I was just wondering is this Item come with a control? If you can write me back today than that would be great. Is this a good Play Station or not?
2,"Save your money, buy a Ps2","The Psx is like 8 years old and the PS one is just a smaller version of it. Do yourself a favor and buy a Ps2, if you have some vision and cash to blow. You can play all your favorite games from the Psx on the PS2 with no needs of extra equipment. I made the terrible mistake of getting a Ps one with an LCD screen for 200$, ""yes I was that stupid"", instead of a PS2 and now that I have a PS2 there is no reason for me to use it anymore and is not worth it even half of the money I paid for it.A PS one is a console of the past, and when you can still play all its goodies in the PS2 there is not really a reasonable excuse to spend not even 50$ in a system like this. As a matter a fact I think the AV cable and the PS one controller together are like 25$, so the console itself is worth 25$ to the people of Sony. Now if for them this item has so little value, (I repeat 25$ at the most) even though it looks cute save your money and put it into the real thing, a good PS2."
3,Where would you plug the screen in?,"For 100 bucks, i would rather spend the extra money and get a dreamcast. Playstation is a little outdated now and if you waited a few months, ps2 should cost only 200."
5,PSone,i ordered one. how big is it really? my cousin has a playstation. it has good graphics but does the PSone have better graphics
4,Hidden game costs,"I bought this machine for my 6 yr old son. He loves it. The machine even got too addicting for him and we had to strengthen the rules regarding when he can play it.However, I was disturbed recently after another of my children scratched one of the games (Spyro, also from Sony) because Sony informed me that they will not replace the game for a reduced charge. Most software manufacturers, if you will send proof of your purchase (or even send them the CD itself), will replace the CD for a nominal replacement cost. However, Sony said I get to buy the whole thing again for the whole price again. I considered their position to be within their rights but customer-unfriendly. It also encourages people to try to copy their games.Call me stubborn, but I will get my son a game from another software company instead of replacing Spyro."
5,new and better,The size of ps one is tiny. When i first got it I was astounded. Compared to the old playstation it is nothing. It is a very good piece of hardwear. It has no glitches. It even has a cd player!!If you buy this make sure you get good gamesbecause without games it is just a cd player.
5,"my childhood in my hands again, thank you amazon!","Ahh The Playstation, The First System I Ever Got. As A Child This Was The Only Thing That Mattered (well this and toys) So Now It's 2011, I Have Playstaion 3, Playstation 2, Wii, Gamecube, Xbox 360, Nintendo 64, PSP, ds, Gameboy advance, But This Is The Best System Out There! Ok The PS3 And The Wii Is Pretty Fun Too I'll Admit, But This System Brings So Many Memories. I'd Say My Favorite Games Were Toy Story 2, Resident Evil 2, Grand Theft Auto, Spongebob Supersponge, And Thrill Kill (ps thrill kill was never officially released, so i had a bootleg, if your intrested in this game you s**t out of luck) And Of Course My First Playstaion Was Also My First Cd Player. So What Made Me Buy A Playstaion One When I Already Have A PS3? Memories, Well That And My PS3 Doesn't Play Some Of My PS1 Games And I Bought Another Copy Of Thrill Kill, And Yes It's A Bootleg."
3,"A good, low-priced system","The PS1 is a good system for you if you only have a few dollars to spare. There are many good games for this system, and most (but not all) of them are under $20. The controller is fairly comfortable, but there are better. The new screen adds portability to this system which is good for long trips in the car or in the air. If you don't have a game system yet, this is one of the best."
4,Great,"We purchsed this for our son for Christmas with the LCD screen the picture is so clear, the system is compact and it will easily travel with us and it will be used in our fifth wheel for entertainment. (He also has a gameboy and I was very disattisfied of the picture view and the games are so expensive). I reccommend the PS1 W/LCD screen."
5,THE BEST VIDEO GAME PLAYER I'VE EVER HAD,"My Playstation broke down in April so I had been very desperate trying to get a PS2 (I still don't have one a month after launch). But then my granpa bought me this thing to keep me happy and I love it. It plays all Playstation games and it's smaller and cuter. I never used any of the ports in the back so I don't really care about those. Even if you already own a Playstation, consider buying this after the next price drop. With the add on screen coming, Game Boy Color won't be dominating the portable game market anymore. Oh, and the person who gave this great console 2 stars because DreamCast can play Playstation games: I don't know where you've been but Playstation2 DOES enhance Playstation games. Not by much, but it does as much as DreamCast."
5,This System is as good as the old playstation but BETTER!,"The Sony PS One has all the great features as the old playstation but smaller, for more compact use, such as taking it with you on a trip, there are attachments that give you a LCD display so you dont have to have a television to use it, I Recommend Kids of ALL ages, it's a lot of fun."
4,Great System!,"This is one of the best systems I have ever owned! If you are thinking to yourself ""well the dreamcast is the same price""it is but you won't nearly find the great selection of games you will with the playstation. Everyone says wait till the ps2 comes out that might not be till next christmas you never know!Many people say that it over heats because it has no fan . well I play mine non-stop for 4 hours and mine sits on top of my dvd player! which would make it even hotter!I put 4 stars for 2 reasons one reason is that every time you press the open button it sticks and it won't close so you have to keep pressing it until it unsticks. THe other reason is that loading time is a little bit longer ""not alot"" with the smaller version. But I recommend you BUY IT!"
5,Fun but breaks easily,Didn't last a year. I am sad that the quality didn't hold up and I can't get the motor fixed becuase they don't sell the part.
5,always the best console,i know they just came out with the ps3 and they have the ps2 but get the system it can play all of your favorite game(mines spyro) and you can get the system and all the games you want for a low price! trust me im not a fake this is the best game system i can think of besides the wii!! if your looking for a low costing good game system with lowcosting games i highly recomend this one!!!!!!!! this game system is also very good for being in the plane or on the road but not with rpg's tough but the lcd screen combo is good 2 so i would either get the psone alone or get the combo!... OVER ALL GET THIS SYSTEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Graphics aren't great, but it's still a good system","Sony's Playstation game console is a good system. The graphics aren't great, saying it's a 32-bit system. The PS2, GameCube, and XBox are 128+. The console, for those not familiar with it, hooks into your television set or VCR with audio/video cords. The PSOne (updated design of original Playstation) also has a LCD screen for on-the-go (sold seperately). If you're looking for a good console system with good (and many) games, pick Playstation. A plus - if you upgrade to PS2, you can play all your Playstation games on PS2. If you can't afford a PS2, get a Playstation, get some games, and buy PS2 when the price drops."
5,IT'S MINI HIM!,"This is Great! I mean it's half the size, half the wight of the original Playstation! it's quite cheap, and you can even hook up a monetor and take on car trips, or plane rides!"
5,great gift,i was looking for a playstation for my two cousins since they loved mine so much and nmorris had a great deal. the shipping was fast. it arrived in time to give as a present and with it all intact. thanks so much!
5,"Remember that ""Friends"" episode?","My feelings about the Sony PSone can best be described through the words of Matt LeBlanc or ""Joey"" from one of the old ""Friends"" episodes. Matthew Perry (Chandler) says, ""Your going to give them the greatest gift anyone could ever give."" To which ""Joey"" responds, ""Your going to have their baby AND give them a SONY PLAYSTATION!?"" The PSone is definately the greatest gift I've gotten for myself in a long time. It rocks!"
1,I Did it all for the Dragon,"This over priced hunk of junk is past its time. A lot of you Sony people think ""wow $100 what a great deal"" it was good a year ago, but it aint good now. First, the price. this thing $100, Dreamcast is $50. there both going out in about a year, but Dreamcast as internet connection, tons of great games (at a cheap price) and graphics to match PS2. as well as a bunch of the games released on PSONE. The playstation does have soe great games, but only a small few compared to the dreamcast library. if you find a PS1 for $50, don't turn it down, but for $100 its an absolute rip off! I have rented many games for it, and here are the ones i liked:Spyro seriesSiphon Filter seriesCool Boarders series. that only a few after litterally 500+ i've tried. sad, real sad. Please, if you want a system from sony just buy a used PS2, its the best Sony deal you can get."
1,Playstation games are being canceled,someone told me that the games are being canceled. Put up a review telling me if you heard the same thing.
2,Sony Playstation 1,"Sony Playstation 1 is the worst possible game you can buy now and days. It has a 32 bit graphics processer and a 133 mHz cpu. The only thing special about it is that it has a screen on it. If you buy this or N64 you are wasting your time!(they're old and stupid! Try to get something new and coll that you can actually see whats going on,on the screen because it has the best,acceptable graphics,and you don't have to take a trip to China and back by the time it's loaded,get Dreamcast. you might can get ps2,but its wasting your money.Dreamcast is ... cheaper than ps2.ps1 is ...,but i think it should be a penny for all it's worth! Dreamcast is ..."
1,I got jipped,"He sent me an Atari game controller instead of my playstation.,, very pissed off, i was suppose to get a game system, and this is very disapointing, dont buy anything from this person"
3,AAAIIIIYAAHHH!,"Well, ITs awesome yes. But the whole no controller thing bothered me since I didnt notice it said not included. Also, The'Eject' button is sticking and kinda seems to be well, breaking, already. BUT alas, it runs well and no problems with that so I guess I dont have much to complain about."
5,Works well but more used than I expected,"You get what you pay for. I went for the good condition psone instead of the very good one (10 dollar difference). Overall the psone is good, but it had quite a few scratches and also there was a hair wrapped into the motor, it looks like a poorly taken care of system so I don't expect it to last very long."
5,ps system,This ps system is just as decribed in the details. It works good I have no problems with it.
4,ps1 good,I recentley got ps1 its better then n64 and dreamcast.but my gamecubes better!I suggest FF7 with it.
3,Great system but they deleted certain ports,This is an awsome system that was made a little worse by the fact that they deleted some of the ports that it previously had for one of my older code cards that you would just plug into the back.
1,not what I was hoping for,"I adore the world of the stone people and usualy buy anything and everything on the subject when I come across it. That was the case here, I bought without really looking and learned a lesson. I just do not understand this book. It really does seem like the author just wanted to put a book out about stones and compacted a bunch of information together between a cover. I am sad to say that this book should not be included in your collection. What a shame that trees have been killed to publish this!"
1,NO NO NO NO NO,This is another example of wicca masquarading as something else. If you want to learn about stones stick with Melody's work and stear clear of this silly silly book
1,"Capitalizing On The Term: ""Sorcery""","Yet another typical fluffy bunny book masquerading as something sinister. That's chic nowadays. What garbage. She's a lovely lady, I met her at a festival once and briefly chatted with her, but her books suck eggs. Sorry Gerina but that's true in my book.Wanna learn real sorcery? Try Tarostar, Brujo Negro, Brother Moloch, Chuck Cosimano, or one of those guys. They're dark, mad and won't hold back the truth. Look up their books and see what you're missing.Save your money. I traded this book away to some kid for some Pokemon cards for my kid's collection. Yeah it's that bad!"
2,"Not the best, nor the worst","For a concise guide, I was still anticipating something more than this. It is great for beginners, and it has a Pagan view to working with stones. Thus, it definitely adds more folklore to the mix. This book discusses some of the famous 'cursed' stones, amuletic magick, and elixirs. Perhaps the best reason to add it to one's collection (if not the only one) is to use it for all of the tables of correspondences.This is a good book to keep around for a quick reference guide or for constructing spells based upon stone magick. The tables are very useful, though there are other books with more comprehensive sections than this."
3,Valuable but not quite definitive,"This text has some insightful commentary regarding the degree to which the Corpus Hermeticum may or may not reflect Egyptian theory and practice as opposed to the merely Hellenic (which point, being academic, is of no great moment). This new translation, however, should assist those relatively unfamiliar with hermetic literature to begin to see suggestions of praxis within the text whereas many other translations obscure this. The decision to leave technical terms like nous in the text rather than translating them was an excellent one. One might wish that they had provided a few more untranslated technical terms.The newly translated 'definitions' are valuable for their ability to add depth and clarify points in the main text."
3,Cooking tool...,"I bought in case I wanted to bake something in my Secura cooker-& it works well. Pies, cakes, meats-if it fits- use it!"
1,Doesn't compete,"Pro: it doesn't breakCon: it doesn't break so I can have an excuse to get rid of it.If you are looking for silicone bakeware, keep going. This is not in the answer. I have been using silicone products for 2-3 years and thought to give this a try. Things stick to it. I was making a 5 layer cake and used this for one of the layers. The other 4 popped out like normal and the kitchenaid one stuck. I tried the ""stick"" test with my casserole and it stuck too. I read the instructions, which suggests you coat it with non-stick. Huh? Isn't that what silicone is for? I tried it several times and same sticky results. I highly recommend you save your money and invest in better products."
2,Not a great pan,"I have used this pan three times now, and every time it is in the oven my entire apartment smells like burning plastic. Also, all of my cakes have turned out uneven and the last one stuck to the bottom of the pan."
2,It does what it is supposed to do but 2MB is not enough,"I bought this module to fill it up with pictures of my family and to use the Vibe alarm in cases where sound would get me into trouble. Hey, I almost forget about the color update for my Prism. I would buy another if it had more memory like 16 or 32, but 2MB is like having pennies in your pockets. I would suggest getting the MemPlug, which gives you a lot of features for a reasonable price."
3,"Works pretty good, but.......","It's a bit hard to turn off. It keeps vibrating even after you press to turn it off. I wish this also had an LED that flashes when something comes up on the Handspring.I don't use it much, unless I'm in a meeting. I don't bother other people when I have a message getting my attenion."
3,2mb extra ram,"2mb is a small amount of memory. but it is quite large and can store many apps. I stored all of my important files on it and even after My visor battery died, my files were still safe, which is good because I would have been really perturbed. My second favorite feature was it got rid of those annoying squeaks and turned it into a vibrating action. But I kept getting it confused with my pager."
2,Hope it uses recycled paper,"The book contains overview of Windows Forms 2.0, and some how-tos of using VS designer to lay out form controls (UI widgets).The overview is shallow, the how-tos are perfunctory, and it is adeqaute neither as reference nor tutorial, yet the author manages to inflate it to over 1000 pages.I'm disappointed at AW and the series editors - AW technical titles used to have consistent and high editorial quality."
2,complaint for the quality of reprint,"I'm not arguing about the content itself, rather my criticisms for the very poor quality of the ""digital"" reprint of the book. Very disappointing because the price, i suppose, is the same as the original print. I've bought two copies, one from amazon.com and another from amazon.it, erroneously assuming that the one from USA could be of a standard print quality. Obviously Amazon does its best for its customers, in this case it is a fault from the publisher."
2,"Extremely redudant writing style, but not many better choices.","I am wondering whether the authors are paid by the number of the words in the book. I find this book is extremely verbose. It is easy to find a paragraph like this. ""Unfortunately,xxxxxx(500 words). Luckily, Windows Forms provides the necessary additional yyyyyyyy(500 words)."" Why he cannot shrink them into one sentence, ""Windows forms provide xxx feature because yyy. xxx is doing aaa."" I find reading the author's bubbling annoying and counter productive, but this could be true for many technical books nowaday, good technical writers are rare."
5,great,"Do not buy ""training Kit"" from Microsoft unless you are a genius or you are already familiar with the subject. They are not for the new kids on the block.Instead by the Step by Step books or this one Microsoft.Net Development Series.This book is discriptive and great. A+ for this book."
5,A must have,"This is a great book for anybody who has to work with windows forms, covers the majority of subjects with bundles of code examples its definatley the strongest book in its field.Its also suitable for beginners so don't think this is just for pros."
5,King of Forms,"This book is King of Forms! It covers all the topics needed to build a strong, full featured ""Windows"" like form. One of few programming books I have actually read from cover to cover and it still serves me well as reference. A must have text."
3,hard boiled/scrambled eggs...,"while its faster to use a whisk for large servings of scrambled eggs, this is great to use when hard boiling eggs for eggs salad. i think it makes a more attractive looking dish"
4,Take a pill! Scramble an egg.,I have had one of these for at least 15 years! It does eggxactly what it is advertized to do. It does a great job of scrambling one egg at a time.It is faster if you have a lot of eggs to scramble to do a batch in a bowl.The only issue would be that it is not really easy to clean. Considering it's eggs and he risks associated with them you need to keep it really clean.I really wish that only people that HAVE a product get to do reviews on a product. If you bought it and found it has problems then complain but don't complain because YOU don't think it's useful!I am tired of reading reviews only to find out that it's a political view of the correctness of the product and because they do not see it as useful I should not buy one. Seems to me that people thought that the automobile was originally a useless device.
4,"Like a ""sexy"" Frank McCourt novel","I felt right at home with the Irish genre of this novel, having previously read both Frank McCourt autobiographies. ""A Relative Matter"" reminded me of a ""sexy"" Frank McCourt novel. It captured my interest from the beginning and held it to the very end. As the protagonist, Geoffrey Doyle, became more entangled in the emotional web both created by him and imposed by his family, I became just as emotionally involved. I smiled at his youthful escapades and felt his frustrations when dealing with his family members in their world of denial. I would strongly recommend this book to others, and look forward to more works by this author."
4,"I Laughed, I Cried...","I know that's a cliché, but this book had me in stitches one minute, in floods of tears the next. I don't advise reading it on the subway, where such mercurial moods tend to elicit funny looks -- not to mention the looks you get if somebody happens to glance over your shoulder at some of the more risqué pages. I do strongly advise reading it somewhere else. The outlandish events of protagonist Geoffrey Doyle's childhood are a hoot, and the author's way of drawing living, breathing characters makes even the elephant-in-the-pub episode somehow believable. Geoffrey's bizarre family relationships are both infuriating and poignant.In a way, A Relative Matter is really two books. The tone changes so much when the scene shifts to Geoffrey's adulthood that I could hardly believe I was reading about the same guy. His often self-inflicted crises and frustrations occasionally made me wish he had never grown up -- but I still couldn't put the book down."
4,"""A Child's Christmas In Wales"" meets ""The Poor Mouth ""","John Fallon's A Relative Matter is one of the funniest, quirkiest, books I've read.It had me in convulsions of laughter one minute and slinking under the seat in front of me, on Metro North, red with embarrassment, the next. And, at another time, quoting a beautiful description of the friendship between ""Mutton"" and ""Moocher"",to my 14 year old daughter.It captures a Dublin and London of the rare old days,when one was a warm sleepy capital and the other a trendy miniskirted seethroughblouse riot of new experiences.In so far as Mr Fallon is writing about a Dublin Protestant coming of age this first book is a firm and eloquent nod to Angela's Ashes and gives an Irish point of view that is not often heard from.This is obviously a labor of love from a man who loves to tell a story."
1,This guy sucks at writing - stick to fapping.,"This guy couldn't write a birthday card, let alone a book. It's terrible. Please don't buy this junk. You are helping bad writers."
4,Parrots,"The only comment I have is to point out that this title is exactly the same book as the following:Parrot Training: A Guide to Taming and Gentling Your Avian Companion (Pets)Different title, different ISBN ... exact same text..."
2,Too old-school,"Too much old-school information on dealing with companion parrots.For a top of the line book, get ""Parrot Problem Solver""."
4,Very rewarding if you keep at it,"As a long time (non-object) programmer and network administrator I picked this book up on a whim and began to try to program in Java. After a struggle, which I believe is the nature of the subject, which is never going to be easy, I finally caught on to what was being presented.I have been adding my Java applets to my web sites. But Java is not going to be for everyone."
2,Java for Dummies? I must be a Moron!,"This book starts off with a shrewed beginning into the world of Caffinated Object Oriented programming. The book began with a brief intoroduction to the possibilities of Java and went through to designing simple web page applets to more advanced applications. Included with the book is a very early version of Sun Microsoystems JDK (java developers Kit). I found the book to be quite frustrating that the learning curve is not existant, it is a jump strait up, however if you are a C/C++ programmer looking to do Object oriented programming online this book is a must."
1,This book makes great fire wood!,"When I sat down at my computer to learn Java through this book, i was left confused ,bewildered, and frustrated. This book has a lack of direction and little or no examples. This book is hard to understand and even harder to use. This book is a book you do not want to add to your cart. This book is definetly for experts and not dummies, which really kind of defeats the purpose."
1,not worth the paper it is printed on!,After doing another 'hello world' you are swept along vague examples and plunged into multimedia and animations before you have understood the first lines. I must not be a dummie because this book was not for me. I recommend the authors to take a course on instructing so they will know how to do it.
2,admittedly quite bad...,"I had high hopes for this book, after flicking through a lot of the Java books in the bookstore, this one really appealed to me because of the large text and nice diagrams. And while the book was pleasently easy to understand (most of the time), it just doesn't flow very well. I found that around page 130-140 I was finding out the stuff I was wanting to know within the first few pages. They also throw in a chapter on HTML in the most inappropriate place. This book seems VERY rushed, and this is obvious from the large number of errors. I was stuck on my code for a number of hours, before I got help from someone on IRC... they were like ""uhh WHY does Switch always have a capital S?"" and I replied ""because this stupid book told me to *sigh*. Even the bonus pull-out ""cheat sheet"" that summarizes the whole book has at least one missing semi-colon. Trust me, get something a bit more... concise."
1,Don't waste your money,"The book starts off okay. You get your feet wet with a simple 'Hello World' example. But then the book jumps into Sprites and Javabots and other relatively complex material. It expects you to swim before you can tread water. Sorely lacking are concise explanations of what the code is actually doing, and how to get from point A to point B. Don't bother with this book."
2,Three strikes and you're out,"You'd think by the third edition that the authors and editors would manage to get the simple, introductory program in the book right. I mean, after all, that's the first exposure we dummies have with Java. But NO. The first program won't compile as shown on the page, or the second or the third. Fortunately, the corresponding programs on the CD work - but they often contain changes that aren't explained in the text. Aside from that, I concur with other comments about the poor organization and design of the book. One good thing I can say is that it focuses on flashy applets, which makes learning more enjoyable.Will someone please write a good introductory beginner's book for Java?"
2,Does not live up to its purpose,"Although this book is for beginners, it is very problematic. I think the publishing company farmed this project out to a developer without telling this person that the book was for beginners. The book starts out with a good primer of object oriented principles but then jumps into advanced stuff such as creating listeners. It does not lay out the lesson plans well the little cartoon graphics are supremely annoying. Other books in this series have been pretty helpful but this one is a bit of a disaster. If anyone finds a good introductory text for Java programming, please let me know."
5,Fili Agiga,This book help me figure out the Java coding and programing. It was also clear and very easy to understand.This is a excelent book for those people that want to learn about Java. Very informative book with greatdetail to the code for those that love to work with Java devlopment.
1,A very nice coaster,"Wow, this book was just downright horrible. After being extremely pleased with HTML for Dummies, I figured this would be of the some calibur. I couldn't have been any more wrong. The first 4 chapters are a nice introduction to the language but I don't think I ever made it through chapter 4; they throw everything at you within a matter of pages and expect you to understand it all. There are much better books out there."
1,Waste of time and money,It wasn't worth my time and money. I became a dummy just because I bought this book.
1,This book is a disaster,"Java Programming for Dummies was my first taste of Java and it almost turned me off forever. I didn't bother to finish the book. Instead I got a copy of Java Software Solutions (Lewis/Loftus) and I'm glad I did. Java Programming for Dummies may be OK for those who don't want to understand what they are doing, but those of us who want to understand should avoid this book."
1,"What do you mean, ""For dummies?""","I couldn't get anything from this book. It was written without dummies in mind. The first 2 chapters were OK, but anything after that was horrible. The only thing good that I can think of was the cartoons."
2,Poorly written - not sure who this book is for.,"I've been in programming for a number of years, and although I have not worked with C/C++, I do have a moderate understanding of OOP.This book moves along from 1 subject area to the next so fast, it never really teaches you anything. I decided to throw the book away after getting to page 142, when it started talking in ambiguities about new subject matter.Ch 2 is okay with its 'Hello World' intro. Beyond that, it doesn't have a lot to offer for any level of programmer, from beginner to advanced."
4,THERE IS A BUT....,"The DVD is AWESOME. Inspiring, heartfelt, and passionate, the artists, scholars, and poets that grace the stage create for a unique experience. If you are a fan of spoken word, this is a must for your collection. They also improve on this DVD by separating the chapters by both episode and by poets. It makes it so much easier to find exactly what you want. My only qualm is that they edit out some of the performances I was looking forward to seeing. Specifically, the performances of Talib Kweli and Rakim were taken out. Why? I don't know. But the reason I bought the DVD was to disregard my old tapes of the season that I home recorded, but since these performances are not there, I have to go to my VCR to find them. Otherwise, a great pick up."
5,Russell Simmons Def Poetry,"If you love the spoken word or poetry, you'll love these DVD's. They are though provoking, intelligent and showcase talented people who we would have never have heard from if not for this type of show. All three seasons are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!"
3,Short bristles,"This brush does an adequate job cleaning the grill, however, the angles of the two metal bars make them fairly ineffective. The bristles of the brush are shorter than I would like them."
4,Great Brush,I've used a few different brushes in the past and this one has been the best so far. Bristles are solid and cleans the grill well. It has a nice handle and the replaceable head is a nice feature. I do agree with the other reviewer that the Amazon price is too high. The manufacture site has it for like $10.99 I believe.
1,Priced Too High by Amazon,This review is only on price. I am surprised that both the local Home Depot and Lowes can price this at 40% lower Amazon in April 2011. This matches the comment by the reviewer in August 2010.
2,Mixed,"This tool is well designed over all and is sturdy. However, the replaceable brush head tends to pop out of the holder/handle easily.I have found using steel wool held with a pair of pliers works equally well and is much cheaper!"
1,Avoid at all cost! Dangerous!,"I'm very sorry to say that this brush just ruined a great family meal. We brushed down the grill grates ahead of grilling, threw on a couple of beautiful flank steaks and a bunch of veggies, only to realize later during the meal that the brush had essentially disintegrated leaving hundreds of tiny metal wires all over the grates and all over our food. We found out by someone spitting one out onto their plate and at this point we're just hoping that none are lodged in our digestive systems. Needless to say, we didn't finish our meals.I strongly suggest everyone not purchase this brush! It's a bad product, that could really cause damage to your health!"
3,Not tried yet but appears to be good quality,Haven't opened the box yet - it's January in New England and we won't set up the grille until late Spring at least. It appears to be a good heavy tool that won't fall apart after a couple of uses!
2,Interesting if flawed history of Stalinist terror,"Robert Thurston has written an interesting --if flawed--history of the Stalinist terror. Correctly criticizing previous histories of the period, Thurston falls into the trap that awaits most revisionist historians: he spends more time looking for information to disprove their arguments than building his own case. A major problem is the author's use of Soviet archival material. Dr. Thurston uses Soviet statistics to build his case often neglecting their obvious bias. For example, he notes that only 63,889 people were arrested for counterrevolutionary crimes in 1939 (119), while later noting that in the same year more than a million Poles from the eastern Ukraine were deported to Siberia (218). Nevertheless, the book is important for students and academic interested in the impact of the terror on Soviet society."
1,pure fantasy,This book is quite simply fantasy in its most pure form. This guy should stick to his day job and the only place his book should be is as a door stop or fodder to get a fire going in the fireplace. It is not worth the paper it is printed on.
5,Finally! Shows I Haven't Seen In Years,"You either like Benny or hate him. Most women can't stand his so-called ""sexism"" (curiously they love Sex and the City and Desperate Housewives, which portray women as nothing but slags). I'm a woman who loved these old shows. The skits and songs that are here aren't the same ones that have been released here on videotape, and they sure beat the tar out of that awful ""Golden"" set. I remember these from the late 70s. There are also quite a few of his commercial parodies here, which I particularly like. Benny tends to repeat some gags over the years, but who cares. The good older things are here. If you liked the tapes that have been released over the years, you'll love this better, it's even funnier. I'm glad someone at Thames dusted off the older, better shows, and put them out for us."
3,"GO AHEAD, LAUGH YOURSELF SILLY","The ten episodes (almost eight and a half hours) from 1972-1774 broadcasts in the UK, include material never seen in the US. With his trademark smirk and self deprecating humor, Hill rejuvenated the traditional English music hall variety show in all its bawdy buffoonery.There must be hundreds, maybe over a thousand, bits of business, filmed gags, sketches, visual puns, and wordplay -- most of it from Hill -- in this great looking digital transfer.The great characters -- Fred Scuttle, Pierre de Tiere, Mr. Chow Mein and Mervyn Cruddy -- are back including Hill's bevy of half clad lovelies. A surprisingly emotional extra is a ""Biography"" segment on Hill.Surely there's a place for low brow humor in our sometimes treacherous world and Hill has stood the test of time with his multitude of loopy, self-absorbed characters (in drag and out). Hill was a master of his craft. Go ahead, laugh yourself silly. It's OK."
1,Watch Out.,I have a matching model of 1f80-261. It has been acting up with problems with the temperature not being accurate. We had purchased a temperature gauge to see the difference and it was always 5-7 degrees off. I went to replace the batteries thinking that may be the problem and the unit started smoking and hissing from behind the screen. I removed the batteries promptly and then removed the unit from the wall all while the grey smoke kept fogging out. I would be very careful of this product as it could very well be a fire hazard.
1,Over heating,"As the previous reviewer said, the temp is off by 5-6 degrees. Worse still, I got to my office (an animal clinic) to find the ACTUAL temp in the building to be 102 at 7:00 AM. The heater was running despite the fact that the A/C was the only thing on. (It was set to the snowflake symbol, only.) The thermostat was unresponsive to any attempt to shut it off. The only way to shut down the system was at the main breaker. The heat pump was inspected by an HVAC technician and determined to be functioning properly. Fortunately, no animals were harmed by this faulty device, but they were very distressed. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DANGEROUS PRODUCT!! I had mine replaced immediately with a Honeywell."
1,No No No This is not Lobster....Fish base but not Lobster,Save your money on this one. Has an interesting color but the flavor is strictly fish base not lobster. Not a particularly good fish flavor either.
5,St. Joseph Altars,"A beautiful book with super pictures. If you cannot come to New Orleans to see the St. Joseph Altars in person, then at least buy the book and enjoy the pictures. The Feast of St. Joseph is on March 19th."
3,Kinda puny,"Even though these say medium shells and they have a good flavor they are really teeny tiny. Like maybe the size of my pinky fingernail puny. Okay for a soup where they can expand to maybe index finger size after hours in broth, but not for any hearty pasta dish. I'd buy their other whole grain pastas without hesitation because the taste and texture for whole wheat is decent, but will skip these little guys next time."
5,Rose Dessert Plates,I bought these to go with the six I already had!now I can not wait to use them for a party of 12!They are beautiful Dessert Plates.
3,Fun Comedy,Marilyn was quite funny in this film. This is the first time she was in control of her comic ability.
5,Timeless beauty,"Can't believe how beautiful Marilyn is. Especially in this movie. The outfits, the way they talk, and how ladies used to be! Amazing movie!"
5,How to Marry a Millionaire,"The quality of the Blu-Ray is excellant. You notice the beautiful colors though not as vibrant as the Diamonds are a Girls best friend Blu-Ray. This is an excellant movie. Becall is the star in this movie even though Monroe steals several scenes. In this movie you can see the transition from Blonde Bombshell Betty Grable to the younger Monroe, I think it's evolution. Overall the film is witty and funny. Enjoyable if you are a fan on the classics and Monroe."
4,High Society Fun,"Lauren Bacall, Marilyn Monroe & Betty Grable are highly entertaining in this tale of models who set out to land a millionaire. Not having any of their own money, they come up with some off the wall schemes to live the lifestyle they are dressed for! All 3 are gorgeous and funny to watch. Each does a great job of playing the quirkiness of their characters. This is a timeless classic that's as appealing today as it was in it's day. A great girly movie. Lauren Bacall has a flair for humor that is delightful to watch."
4,Satisfied again.,Items was received in condition expected and in the amount of time that is was promised. thank you so much!
2,Unfunny Comedy,HTMAM is a mediocrity.No song-and-dance-numbers. No entertaining dialogue.Characters which I didn't care much about.
4,Marilyn should get the millionare,"Marilyn Mnroe shines in this movie and all three ladies add a great comedic touch. Definately worth your money, you'll want to watch it many times"
4,"Cute movie, but the pan & scan (...)","According to the video, ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" was the first movie released in CinemaScope. CinemaScope is the super-long screen, and, since this movie was the first, you can tell they made ample use of the longer screen.Well, at least you can GUESS that they did that. There are many, many scenes where you can tell that they did a shot of all three women - Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Lauren Bacall - sitting next to each other, but because of the pan & scan, you only get to see two of the three on your screen.Bottom line: if you can find a Letterbox version, buy that instead. Otherwise, it's a cute little story."
4,"for an early dbz vid, its great","i think the part with goku at the beginning, and his voice are done right .... The fight with Zarbon was pretty kool though, and if ur a fan, ull defenitly like this vid or dvd"
4,As Expected,This Pure Mint flavoring is the closest I've found to the mint I grow in my yard. I use it in my ice tea all winter.I was glad to find a six pack of these bottles ... they're sometimes hard to find in the local grocery stores. Price was average ... convenience a plus!
1,Careful: Mostly Spearmint,"This product is NOT pure peppermint extract; it is a mix of spearmint and peppermint, and (to my taste) very heavy on the spearmint, of which I am not very fond. You also should know that you cannot return this item. My fault, I should have read about this product more carefully."
3,this product so far is good,"i have been only taken this pill for two days now and it really helps me when i am working out, i only started on one pill twice a day. so far so good. the only thing that i have found is it gave me a bit of a headach, but other wise good so far. can any one tell me where i can find more reviews on this pill. ....."
4,Energy and keeps me from getting the munchies...,"I tried several before I came across this product. It didn't give me the shakes yet it kept my energy level up and when it was leaving my system you could barely tell. I also found that I wasn't hungry all the time when taking this supplement. I have moved on since but it was great to jump start my weight loss, along with working out 5 days a week and eating a balanced diet."
2,Disappointed,"Very poor packaging and obvious mishandling before packaged. I had many damaged items when I opened the large outer box. The t was dented badly and the box it was in was in good condition. Some of the other boxes were obviously damaged before they were placed in the large package. The kit was replaced and the second kit wasn't any better. There were numerous dents and dings in the parts making them look used and abused. Some of the damage may have occured during shipping, which is unavoidable the way it is packaged. I would have been a happy customer if the product had gotton to me in to me in good condition. I hope Selkirk addresses this step in the process of getting a quality product to the customer."
5,Perhaps He Should Have,"I read this book some years ago and found it to be one of the best on its (actual) subject: Baptism in the Holy Spirit. The author is calm, clear, sympathetic and thoughtful. He is clearly in touch with the subject matter both historically and biblically. Though he does not deal with the manifestations of the latest BHS movements this does not detract from the book. The biblical principles addressed are timeless.IMO, the former reviewer is typical of people trying to address issues beyond their ability or maturity. I fail to understand why he/she thought that giving a surface review of a book (especially after acknowledging that little effort was given to even read the book) would be helpful to anyone or be fair to the author. I wish Amazon would let us somehow drop these kinds of frivolous, immature and misleading reviews."
1,What a piece of crap,This is the worst pan I have ever had. We love mini muffins and have had Wilton and other pans. They are hard to clean so I thought I would buy this one and cleaning would be a snap.1st. The silicone smell was horrible.2nd. The pan warped in oven. I used the sled it came with and followed directions3rd. I washed in hot soapy water 3 times and still muffin residue4th. The muffins did not come out. I used spray I waited until cool and still they stuck.I will never buy silicone anything. Don't waiste your money.
3,3.5 stars,you pretty much get what you pay for with these things they look great on and the microfiber bag does some good but when taken off the glasses felt a little flimsy at both ends of the lenses that connects to the rest of sunglass plastic body im worried that taking them on and off abrubtly or if they fell off that they would break if your looking for these to last a while id invest in a better brand.
3,nasty audio,"All I have to say is the season was fine the video was fine but I'll tell you after three,count 'em,three sets I can say honestly who ever is in charge of the audio portion should be shot. Blaring,nasty audio is what both volumes of this set had. I mean come on I'm an independent filmmaker and there is no reason to have such bad audio. Finally had to just return them all!!!!!"
2,Poor Sound & Episodes from Complete Season1,"I thought that perhaps I was losing my hearing. I looked (in vain) for subtitles to see if that would help. My partner assured me that no, my hearing was fine, the audio on these DVD's is woeful.Then I started to have episodes of deja vu. Or maybe jkust episodes that were on The Complete Season One were included in this. Huh? Very strange.I won't buy again until they do something about the audio. It is headache enducing."
3,Disappointed Ghost Hunters Fan,"I love the show and I read the reviews before buying the DVD. So I thought I was prepared for the bad sound quality. Not so!! It is so much worse than you think. C'mon guys. There is no excuse for these DVDs to be on the market. You have loyal fans that love the show. At lease check the quality of the stuff you're selling!! You've thrown Brian under the TAPS van for less!! Season 2 is awesome. I have no problem buying part 1 and part 2 to get the full season. BUT, don't make me buy a third DVD (""Best of Season 2"") to get the Savannah episode that should have been included with all the rest. Overall: 1 star for production and marketing. 4.5 stars for the actual episodes."
3,"Good Show, Bad Audio, Irritating Pettiness","Yes, buy the set because it's interesting, thrilling, has some great footage of possible ghostly things, and is mostly entertaining.However...the audio is inexcusable; the ""clipping"" (sound levels way too high) creates a raspy, distorted soundtrack. I've never heard anything as inferior as this, which doesn't speak well of the manufacturer.It's unfortunate that these shows also included the petty squabbling among cast members, which consumes a major chunk of several shows. So-and-so forgot the table, so-and-so has always been a troublemaker (yes he is, and he talks like he's got a mouthful of cotton).And get used to the constant subliminal advertising for Roto-Rooter.A likable show, but as for this set, look for bargain pricing or a used copy."
3,"love the show, hate the sound","My husband and I are huge fans of the show, and have purchased all of the dvd's up to this point. This particular set was a huge disappointment to me because of the extremely poor sound quality. I don't know if it was something with the dubbing or what, but it's overly loud yet very muffled. Also the picture isn't very clear either at times. Still a fan, but wish the sound would have been clearer, I feel it really took away from the investigations at times."
4,Ghost Hunters with scary sound quality,Ghost Hunters is a great show. We've enjoyed watching every episode. My only issue with the set is the sound quality is fairly poor. Maybe they sould have a different company master the discs before putting out season three.
2,Too much hunting and not much ghost,"I only got to watch the first disc, as the other 3 in this collection were damaged, but one was enough, to watch a bunch immature guys, fighting personal problems, while hauling around a bunch of scientific equipment, to trap evidence of Spititual activity. It would be interesting if there was less bickering and more finding. I have certainly seen many other shows, of similar subjects, that were a lot more interesting and produced more than spare time Ghostbashers, who couldn't help a Spirit, to save their Souls.Ghost Hunters: Season 2, Pt. 2"
2,GH Review,"This season of Ghost Hunters is my favorite. The episodes in Ireland are the best. However, the quality of that specific dvd was not good. It just so happend that there was some kind of interference on the disc(that you can visibly see), that ruined that specific episode for me. The disc kept freezing and getting scrambled. I had also purchased Season 3 Part 1 and on the last disc of it, I had the same problem that wouldn't allow me to watch the bonus investigation. It too had the markings on the disc. I don't know if this has happened on any of these discs before or not, but it should be checked out. Before this I've had good luck ordering dvds from here."
4,Still has A/V problems in 2008,Just received my copy from Amazon in January 2008 and it STILL has the awful audio/visual problems. WHY do Amazon continue to sell these faulty copies ??Such a drag having to get replacements over to me the UK.Great show though.
3,"Great Episodes, Poor Dvd Quality",The episodes in this season were fanstatic but the quality is extremely poor. Both sound and picture suffered throughout most episodes and at times the show would freeze for a few seconds. I thought it was my dvd player that caused the problems but I see that others experienced the same diffculties. I wish I held back and read some reviews before purchasing these dvds that way I would of known what to expect and held back on ordering them. For the price we paid we should at least get our moneys worth.
2,Worst audio ever!,"I was excited to finally have the second season of Ghost Hunters...Until i watched the DVDs. The sound is the worst i've ever heard. I hoped i had just gotten a bad copy and could return it, until i found out that every copy sounds like this. It's almost unbearable. I shame too since i've been waiting excitedly for this show to be released since it aired."
3,Some complaints.,"The season is great don't get me wrong, but there's a lot of stuff on here that was overlooked.The audio is horrible at some points in basically all the episodes, the visual quality is sometimes low. My biggest complaint is the they left out the halloween special. There's a gap in the episodes where the special should be. Makes me mad. I'm hoping for a re-release of better quality versions."
4,Only if you must,"I'll admitt when I first read the reviews from all the other consumers, I thought ""the audio can't be that bad...they must all be THX junkies...and I'm not that crucial.""...well, to all those reading this pondering a purchase, they are ALL correct. I have never heard audio like this even on a VHS tape back in the 80's. Its a shame too because this season is the most exciting to date...they find more evidence than both seasons 1 and 2 pt1 combined...I would have happily waited another month or two for the production company to realease it the right way, not a hurried piece of [...]that it is. I'll tell you right now, the audio doesn't ruin the evidence, but it's annoying enough to make you wonder why you didn't listen the entire time you watch. Only buy if you absolutly must complete your collection."
2,Like Nails On A Chalk Board,"This DVD set had a lot of potential, but it falls victim to sloppy DVD production. The show its self is great, but they really dropped the ball in bringing it to DVD. The menu options link to incorrect content, and the audio quality is so atrocious that it becomes a major distraction. The problem with the audio is that it's too hot (loud), and as a result it becomes distorted and annoying. I thought it was either my dvd player or my TV until I played it in my computer and had the same problem. I have experience with audio/video production and I am in awe of the fact that this was released in its current state. Those associated with the process of moving this show to DVD format should be ashamed of what I would call a ripoff. Keep your money."
5,Ghost Hunters RULE!,"What can I say? I've been hooked since the very first episode of Season 1! These ""Plumbers by day, ghost hunters of The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS) by night"" continue to intrigue and entertain even the non-believer when it comes to ghosts, hauntings, and the paranormal! The two lead investigators, Jason and Grant, work for Roto Rooter during the day, but are full-fledged, serious paranormal investigators on nights and weekends! Go figure. If you are not already a fan by season 2, you need to be!"
5,Very quick shipping.,Very good addition to the ghost hunters collection. Maybe need not to seperate seasons down so much. Person that it was ordered for loved it. Had nothing but good things to say about. Makes a great gift for peolpe that love ghost stories.
2,LOVE the show - HATE the poorly made DVD's,"As a huge fan of this show I could not wait to buy both of season two's DVD's. However, they are so poorly made it has been a very disappointing ordeal as I have ordered and returned two sets of the DVD's twice due to very bad static and overly loud voice audio. The color was off as well. I thought it was just bad luck until I read everyone's reviews. Hopefully the problem will be fixed and someday I will be able to purchase good quality Ghost Hunters videos."
3,"Great realistic show, but what's with the sound effects?","I love TAPS. I am an open-minded skeptic, but it manages to frighten me everytime! I love the main ghosthunters, they are a wonderful group of people and it's great how they react towards their experiences. This goes beyond ghost movies/tv shows. This is actual ghost encounters. It is very realistic. I know a lot of people say a lot of things, that they are fake - or their facts aren't straight. . . but watch it with an open-mind and you will be thrilled.My favorite episode was the St. Augustine lighthouse investigation which is on this dvd.My only complaint is the sound quality isn't all that great.Also, I have issues with little ""sound effects"" the editors felt like they needed to add to the experience. It actually RUINS the experience in my opinion. It's like ""I don't hear anything. Oh I heard it! Wait was that music from the show?"" Change those flaws, and you got yourself a 5 star dvd. But as of now 3 stars."
1,All Scratched Up like bought at a yard sale!,"Got both part 1 and 2 of Season 2 as a gift for my husband who is collecting these CD's thinking I'd save money and hassle of driving so far from home just to get. I should have went shopping, at least I could have gotten a quick exchange or my money back. It's not worth the $ to ship back and wait to see if I get screwed two times in a row. Both vol 1 and vol 2 have so many scratches and skips it's hard to believe these are their NEW ones and not their USED. It looks like a child had them in a sand box and rubbed etchings all over them. One disc even has hard circles dug into it and it freezes up and skips a whole section of the investigation. To say the least, I will be a bit pickier of whom I choose to do business with.Buyer Beware!!! I'm out money I didn't have to just blow $34.00 and got a very crappy product. I could see it if I bought Used but my husband refused and it came actually worse than used."
1,Don'r Recommend,"My husband and I love paranormal shows.I bought the following series in a bundle with a discount.I was so disappointed in Season 1 and Season 2. It is clear that the show, after making money on the first season changed and upgraded.However the ""lead investigator"" by the name of Jason is a real Jerk on the show and continues humiliate one of his employees. He and his partner Grant constantly continue to criticize his work performance.Especially in front of the cameras - do it off the cameras!And again no ghost activity - what a waste of time! And I see they even have up to Season 5, how did they stay on the air for so long?!I don't recommend this!"
2,GREAT SHOW POOR QUALITY,"The quality of Ghost Hunters season 2 part 2 is poor. I didn't have any problems with season 2 part one. I only had problems with season 2 part 2. Disk 5 does not play but disks 6, 7 & 8 play. There are several places where disk 6 skips. Sometimes, Grant and Jason are able to proove that a place they go to is haunted. Sometimes, they can debunk claims that a place is haunted. I like season 2 part 1 better. Sometimes, they can pick up a shadow or a ghostly voice which is weird. Than again, they find a lot of weird things on this show."
3,Good to have...HARD to clean!,"I bought this for my husband who loves to grill fish and fruits like pineapple. It is just the right size for our standard grill, but is HARD to clean! I have to say, even after using Pam spray for grilling, I was still scrubbing with Brillo for quite a while to get everything clean. Anyone have any ideas to make that job easier? I've seen smaller grill baskets for less money, but have not tried to clean those after use. Mmmm, I'm not sure this is worth it...."
4,reason,I like it. I would like it to have been higher. also it is a pain to turn the card over to read the back
5,Excellent item.. but....,You can get these clear acrylic photo frames quite a bit cheaper at your local walmart.
5,Valve Spring Compressor,"Much better than the over priced one at the local automobile parts/tool store thank you, fast shipping I have already told a friend about product, he wants to use it, I said nope! wait till I'm done or buy your own!"
4,Fun Stocking Stuffer,Everyone enjoyed these in their Christmas Stockings. My two year old has gotten to a couple of them and broken them....but those that have escaped his wrath are treasured.
1,The 3d is not region free.,This will not play in 3d using a USA 3d blu ray player. It will play in 2d. Not much to say about the product since. I can't enjoy the 3d
2,Horrid,"Recently read this book and I must say it is rather lacking. Main character survives multiple nuclear attacks from Soviets who have wiped-out the population of the Americas with a designer plague. Book ends rather abruptly as well. However, I did finish the book, so I will give it 2 stars. Also took into consideration this novel was a product of the 1970's of which I have read several not-fit-for-printing paperbacks."
1,Don't buy this movie,"Three of us watched this movie last night and nobody liked it. Ed Asner was good, the dog was good and a young girl was good. Other than that the other actors were terrible, the script was bad and very predictable.I don't know what the other people who like this were watching but we would definitely not recommend it."
5,Great Product,I used these labels for my Christmas Cards. They are perfect and I highly recommend them. They are easy to use and look great.
3,Quality suffering,"Been using these same labels for a number of years. This year, the batch I received was cut incorrectly - there was no short tab at the head of the labels roll to feed which caused the first label to be ""skipped"". Then, at the end of the roll the last label was only 3/4 length which required us to hand write the last item from each roll. Finally, it would be great if Dymo could come up with a sticker to keep the roll spooled that isn't so sticky. Any residue not removed manually causes that second label to print incorrectly again requiring a manual step for our crew."
1,Dyslexia is NOT neurological to this author - RESEARCH???,"I'm not dissing what the woman is saying about teaching reading but when a person truly has dyslexia, it is a neurological disorder. No one can teach it to you and that's what this woman is stating. Where's the research? Does the National Association of Dyslexia back her on this? I've emailed them about her quote and they say they have no research to validate her claim. Don't believe everything you read, no matter how badly you want to believe. People who are dyslexic have to bust their buns to figure out how to read."
1,'same old same old',The only thing new here is the author's name. This book pitches the 'same old same old' from a new kid on the block. The one star I'm giving this book is for the forward by Steven Pinker. The rest of this book is unfocused and the argument is inconsistent. The stories of students are stiff. It's obvious this author doesn't know many children. This makes the reader question the integrity of the research presented.
2,disappointing,"I have been using the Phono-Graphix method with my two boys and I will be teaching it in my second grade classroom next year. I bought ""Why Our Children Can't Read' because I thought it would tell me even more about Phono-Graphix. But much of the information is the opposite of what I learned using Reading Reflex. I also feel that Mrs. McGuinness's argument against phonics and whole language is disappointing. I was hoping for something to present to my school as an argument. I won't use this book."
1,this reading teacher's experience,"READING TEACHERS BEWARE: The author calls blends 'clusters' and rules 'tendencies', but it is nothing more than the same old Phonics with several new layers of rules added in. I've been working with a boy being taught with the author's own program called Allographs. He is in worse shape now than when he started, despite the fact that he can recite the author's charts in the book by rote. The author says that dyslexia is caused by poor instruction and says that her method is the answer, but for this young man it has been a seven month waste of time."
2,"If you have to believe everything a book says, don't read it","That, in essence, is what Mencius had advised. It is also what frequently popped into my mind as I read the book.Some books are written to inform, while others are written for very commercial reasons. Having read Overcoming Dyslexia by Sally Shaywitz, I could appreciate the contrasting styles adopted by the authors. One attempted to be objective and scientific, while offering hopes for parents who are agonising over their kids who can't read; another sought self-promotion by thrashing others and making outrageous claims based on skimpy research, hoping to make offers to parents who are agonising over their kids who can't read.A two-star book is not necessarily badly written or worth less a read than a five-star book. In fact, it may prompt you to think harder and read between the lines. Reading two books writing on a similar topic especially helps. If you are into reading difficulties, read Overcoming Dyslexia first."
5,Nice,I bought this for my 2010 Sierra Denali and it looks and works great. I did'nt want to pay an arm and a leg for an alarm.So my local best buy installed it for 30 bucks and installed a kill switch with it too.Its very bright and can be seen a mile away.I figured my truck already had a remote start and factory alarm.Why pay more and maybe screw up all the electronics with a new alarm.
2,Errors Galore!,"Although the story in this book keeps you interested, the type is riddled with grammatical errors, misspelled, misused, and omitted words...almost like it never received any proof-reading! I thought this was very distracting...because every time a sentence didn't make sense, or the use of ""their"" and ""there"" was misused, etc., it brought me back to ""consciousness"".....and took away from the author's credibility!"
3,EXCELLENT SERVICE,"I ordered this item (season five of grey's anatomy) from amazon on the 23rd of April and was told I would receive it between the 28th and the 4th. The package arrived to me on the 26th. Although I am very pleased with the timely manner it arrived I am upset that my disc 4 appears to be in perfect condition yet on the four dvd players and two game systems I have tried to watch it on, it skips, the sounds gets off and sometimes it just will not start at all. Very unhappy with a none working disc."
3,What happened?,"Loved Seasons one through three. Liked very much season four but it hit some sour notes. Then season five fell flat, at least by my expectations. Interns cutting each other open like this was an episode of ""nip tuck"". The whole ghost stuff with Izzie was ridiculous. One can see why the actress desperately wanted to leave this show. George is nowhere to be found in the majority of episodes. We just get one hot guy and girl after another trying to re-create some of the magic of the first three seasons."
2,"Boring, oh so boring......","I can honestly say that I am tired of the whole Izzy & Denny scenario. Also, this series has lost some of its zest. It seems as though the actors are just going through the motions. ""Little grey"" is an irritating character to watch as well."
3,Is Season 5 EVER coming out on Blu-Ray before they release Season 6????,Just curious about Season 5 being released in Blu-Ray Format. When is this finally going to be sold? I've seen pre-order for almost 1 year but never a firm relaease date. I see that (in DVD) format Season 6 is to be released for sale beginning 9/14/2010.
1,I can't watch Grey's Anatomy!!,"I was very excited to receive the 5th season of Grey's Anatomy. When it arrived in the post, I rushed home to start watching. But I am not able to watch it. The discs are set to Region 4, which means that me in Region 2 are unable to play it. My DVD player displays a message that says: ""Incorrect region code. Unable to play disc."" This is the first time that I have heard about this and are very disappointed that I have wasted my money and energy to order this product. I would have liked to know about this before purchasing the product."
1,Grey's Anatomy Season 5,"I ordered Grey's Anatomy Season 5 from Amazon.com The DVD package was so damaged (not because of mail damage, it was so worn and torn that I wondered who had owned it). I thought the packaging would not affect the DVDs. Wrong. The first DVD is damaged and won't play. I can't remember who I ordered it from. Could you please check for me so I don't order from them again."
1,"Would probably love it, if it was delivered like it says it is....","Never Recieved, sent via USPS and they say delivered and I say BS!!! never got it, surely paid for it...."
4,A Must Have If You Are Still A Fan,"If you are still a fan of Grey's Anatomy then this is a must have addition. The series has suffered from character bloat but as I said; If you are still a fan, you will want this season."
4,Greys Anatomy Season 5,"Grey's Anatomy is an American television medical drama that premiered on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), as a mid-season replacement on March 27, 2005. (According to:[...] ).What a wonderful adventure through the years to see the Actors evolve into their characters."
3,Love among the ruins or shagging among the terminally ill,Does anyone keep their pants on in this series? George and the rest sure do get around. They could use a few visiting physicians on sabbatical to at least give a change of scenery. Continues to be mildly entertaining but getting stale.
1,knock this garbage down a peg,"This show is completely awful. They should really air it during the day with the rest of the soap operas and, let people record it instead of wasting valuable primetime time slots. Don't waste your money on this. And while your at it, re-adjust your entire value system."
1,pretty disgusted,Don't know why I bothered to order Season 5 and 6 after I had trouble with Season 4. Same problem with all...unable to play the episodes...and the problem persisted with three different DVD players. Kicker was when I was required to pay postage to return defective product. I'm done!
4,Second half brings Grey's back to life,"There are more detailed, in-depth reviews already on this page, so I will keep this short. The first half of the fifth season is lacking, with weak plot lines trying to tie up loose ends. The second half brings Grey's Anatomy back to what it used to be, with interesting developments that make you care about certain characters. The end is a cliffhanger that is sad, yet deals with a character that has suffered in the writing since season 3."
5,Grey's Anatomy Season 5,Grey's Anatomy is one of the best shows on television. Keep up the good work. Product was delivered in a timely manner and in excellent condition.
4,GREY's,"Have to say that this season is very very emotional, just a hard one, but excellent.Totally amazing.The season arvd on time and in good shape regarding the box. Had some issues with some Dvd's, freezed images that would jump to another section of the show. Weird.Overall good.I love this SHOW!"
3,A serious misstep,"They should have changed the show's title for this season to ""Izzie's Anatomy"" because all the other plot points were marginalized around Katherine Heigl's character. I'm sure she'll have a lovely film career, but they should have let her out of her contract sooner. T.R. Knight's George became invisible this season, not even appearing in some episodes. So, he leaves too. I really hope the show's writers come up with some new top shelf plot lines."
1,Where is my DVD?,I have ordered and paid for this item but not yet received it so hard to review. Please send my item
3,NEW?,"When I ordered this product, I ordered it NEW. When it came it was all scratched up on the cover. It is new, but the sellers need to do a better job packaging the item next time."
2,Be warned - not for busty ladies.,"The bag looks great. It's a sharp design and color, but if you have a curvy figure, this bag is extremely silly...basically excentuating your...top curves.Bet it looks very sporty and stylish on boys or the flat chested."
1,Don't waste your $$$$...,"The cover is hard plastic in the front and aluminum in the back but only held together by two rubber side inserts. The first night I brought it to the gym and dropped my player, the case came off and shattered on impact. I had it for a record of 2 days before I had to throw it out.. What's the point???????"
3,"Nice Looking, plastic scratches too easily","I bought this case about a week ago. I really like the look of the aluminum back. The hole in the bottom is large enough to connect the sync cable connector and there's no protection for the controls (it's a cutout on the front). The plastic screen scratched the first day and, although I've kept the player in either a pocket or it's pouch, it's pretty scratched up after only a week. I'll probably replace it in a few months with a different brand if it continues to scratch like this. Too bad, because it's really a nice looking case."
1,Boo!,I was not impressed and I am very disappointed. It felt like canablistic journalism. The comparison of Stoll to Star was the most accurate thing I have heard. I am ashamed that he can call himself an athropologist. Anthropologist's usually have more respect for other cultures. I hope the damage Stoll created with this book doesn't result in the loss of more lives in Guatemala.
3,Great accept the paint...,Love the hat works great looks great we never take off. However the So.Fl. sun is no match for the die paint which came off under the first So. Fl. thunderstorm
5,Great hat with flashlight,"There are a must have for people who do any kind of walking at night. If you have a pet or are doing something where you need more lighting, just put on the hat, hit the button for the light and you are set."
5,everquest,Ok frist off if i Buy this will it include Kunark? i already have the Frist EQ Cd but not kunark. I am also wondering is there any new things? like you can be lvl 76 or something Like that? If so Please tell meKeep on Playing EQ !Higlo 19 warrior on fennin ro
5,EQ,"IF you have been playing everquest for a while then you probably already know about SoV, and are probably drooling over it right now. If you don't even know what Everquest is, then take a look at Ruins of Kunark. ... All i have to say is this:should you decide to play everquest, let your family and friends know where you are, because they wont be seeing you for a while."
1,LOVE / HATE E.Q.,I have been playing EQ for about a year and enjoyed it without any problems but the last patch or set of patches they made me download jackup the game. It was a directx patch for the new upgrade. Lots of other people have complained about sound and graphic since the last patch. Verant has refused to do anything about it and blames the dumb customers for the problems. I havent played in about a week and miss the game alot. I would buy S.O.V. if i was still able to play it. Make sure you have the few video cards verant wants you to have before investing in the game.
1,...,"A poor attempt to add content and game space to the EverQuest world. Graphically it is nice, somewhat better than the original and Kunark. Content wise, is still your basic hack and slash. Only a few new ""mobs"" have been added, most are just old models with a new skin. As far as new quests go, there is a three way faction that the game designers are still monkeying with; I decided to quit playing rather than wait on Verant to come to a final decision. The game space added is negligible to many servers, as there is a build up of higher level characters to contend with in these higher level dungeons. I give it one star for the effort involved in making it. If it were designed from a players perspective rather than an accounting perspective it would have rated higher with me."
1,Everquest just keeps getting worse,"Everquest was a fun game that gets progressivly more boring each level you gain. AT first I thought this game was excellent but as my character grew so did the problems, spending hours just trying to find monsters to fight, lag deaths, terrible customer service, and the list goes on. This expansion pack is no diffrent from the rest of the game. Aviod this like the plague and spend your money on the better upcoming online roleplaying games."
1,What? No Player Killing?!,"I expected this game to really rule. I thought to myself, ""Tens of thousands of players rpging together? It will be chaos! People will be banding into nations and battling each other for dominion! Imagine my disappointment when I found that pking is not only disallowed(or restricted), in most servers, most players I talked to professed DISGUST at player killers! Worse, guards are now near invulnerable. What? Can't a guy have a little fun and slip a 6-inch dagger between a guard's plates and into his back? It's only an AI. I pray for the day that someone with a sense of fun (dreary drugdgery, which is what this game is starting to feel like after four months) takes over this company and point this world into the right direction."
3,Cool interface,I've seen screenshots and the new UI is pretty awesome. There are now 10 sets of 10 hot-buttons (100 instead of 36) and you can move any window wherever you want it. Don't want the group list? Move it somewhere out of view!
3,Savipup Karana-Shadow Knight,"I agree with earlier reviews that this is the best game currently on the market, However, I used to say that about Ultima Online. Both games suffer from the same problem, the game designers are non responsive to any ideas they don't agree with, which is to say, they do anything they like, often at your, the paying customers expense. I left Ultima when EQ came out and experienced the same poor customer support once i reached a level where it made any difference, and I will leave EQ when the next MMORPG comes out, I hope not from Veriant or Origin. I am letting my money speak for me at my displeasure with both companies. Visit any of the many websites devoted to either game and read first hand what you will be required to endure once you advance to a level where it makes a difference before you purchase either game, or their follow on products."
2,...,"i been playing everquest for a long time and sov is no better then the first or lulcin verant will still never allow you to make a dime spawns still never drop anything, it used to be fun when they would allow people to make a living but now nothing drops anymore ,or its all no drop you have to go [somewhere else] just to be able to get armor cause verant refeuses to let anybody make any plat or loot and when you do camp something youre sitting there for 10 hours in a group with 6 people and have to roll for it it would be a great game if they would just allow people to actually get armor and gear but they wont and the techinal staff [is bad] but thats just my oppinion of the game"
3,It won't work.,"Experienced EverQuest grognards know why this expansion will NOT work.First of all, Verant stated that Velious will be set up like a huge, epic quest. Zones will have to be gone through in a certain order. Three words: Huge Traffic Jam. It'll be like another Plane of Sky. Except it's a whole continent, not just one zone. Uber guilds and uber guild alliances will have to take turns going through the place.In other words, it's going to be a mess, and probably will not help the high level baby boom problem in EverQuest."
1,Reviewing something that isn't even previewed?,"Unlike most game companies, VI lets nothing at all be known about games that they are about to ship. They basically take the stance, ""trust us, it is fun, we are gaming gods"" Nothing is known about the game, and no review is possible. Asking someone to preorder this game based upon NO information is an exercise in the gullibility of your customer base."
1,Timex Women's Ironman Triathlon Sleek 50/100 Watch,"This watch did not last long in the water even though it said it was waterproof for 200 meters. It lasted 2 weeks.If you plan to purchase it for water, look somewhere else."
1,Watch Band Issues,"I have owned timex ironman watches for a long time. Lifeguarding, college, work, family, salt and fresh. I bought this timex for my wife based on past quality experiences with Timex. The watch works fine. The wristband pulls apart from the watch. She can't use it for any major activity as the watch falls off. The band is kept on by four hooks. I would not recommend this type of wristband on any Timex. (Timex refused to warranty the wristband.)"
2,They keep getting worse,"I have had at least five of these watches over the years and it used to be that I only had to replace it about every two years and only because the band finally broke, (I'm pretty hard on them, wear them all the time and do lots of sailing) but the amount of time they last has dropped a lot! On one of them a button fell off the first week, my last one hasnt even made it a year and started leaking water right away, now if you go NEAR water it fogs up and if you are in direct sunlight it goes blank. I used to love Ironman watches but never again for me."
1,"Terrible band, watch fogs.","(Posting for my 15 year old daughter who runs track.) This watch is not for an athlete. The band is a terrible design. The ""Y"" connection pulls away from the watch, letting the watch FALL OUT while you are running. It also turned yellow/brown after 30 days of use. The watch fogs when it gets damp. (A triathlete swims... and certainly sweats!) Poorly designed watch."
1,very unreliable,Nice design and number of functions. Unfortunately bad quality. The watch started to fog after a few weeks after rain or even sweating (designed for active women). Once stopped working for a few days untill completely dried up. Not reccomended.
2,"Nice watch, lousy band","I agree with many regarding the comfort and features of the watch, but the band is terrible. I didn't mind at first when the first one just got faded to a muddy shade of clay, but when the band lost grip of the watch I thought it was a singular problem. The second watch I bought to replace it separated band from watch before I even had time to complain about the color fading. Timex really needs to fix this problem!"
2,A Sad Disappointment,"I bought this watch a year and a half ago, and it has been one disappointment after another. Within a few weeks, the color started chipping away from around the face. After a few months the band began breaking away from the face. I have decided to purchase a Casio. I hope it lasts longer than my Timex."
5,Nice watch,"Great features on this watch. I especially like the linked timers and the three alarms. My wrist is tiny, and the selection of holes is great (I use the tightest). This does leave a gap because the band is still bigger than my wrist, and the extra band wraps all the way around, but it doesn't slip and it feels very comfortable. The alarm sound is pleasant. The color is great too."
5,Great Watch,"As a runner, I have been using this watch for almost three years. I've never had any problems, and it's very easy to use. The only reason I'm purchasing a new one is because it's gotten faded and has started to fall apart b/c of how much I wear it. I'm getting the same watch again! I love it!"
4,"For The Price, Nice","I replace my outdoor watch about once a year. For sport activities and general running around this watch is dandy. It is waterproof, keeps time in two zones, and has multiple alarms. I don't use the lap feature because I don't participate in competitive sports, but my friend owns the same watch and she likes to use that feature and thinks it works well.The watch is in shades of blue and grey. It has a somewhat sleek and feminine profile which makes a nice transition to casual surroundings. My watch takes a beating because I am not careful, but this watch is holding up well and doesn't have any scratches after six month. I like the indiglo feature and the digital display which makes it easy to see. It is comfortable and fully adjustable on a small to average sized wrist.This watch is readily available at big box stores and is competitively priced so you can get it at a lower price point than retail."
3,"Nice Style, but Not-So-Nice Face/Band","I love this watch, I really do. I like that my skin under the watch dries quicker because of its design. I has lasted me through races, even through an ocean swim. But then diving into a 10-foot swimming pool clouded the face. It did clear up, but now the rubber around the watch has started to separate. This was my second Ironman...off to try another brand, I guess. I need something more durable!"
3,Love the Watch features. Band is poor design,"After almost two years, my band finally just bit the dust. The watch separated from the band a while ago, but my band just snapped last night. I love the features on the watch. I love the look of the watch. But that band . . . is just not made well. I'm not an athlete, but I use the alarms and timer all the time. So, the watch band died with just everyday use. I never had a fogging issue with just doing dishes and bathing kids."
1,Band falls off,"Everything about the watch has worked fine for me and has been great, except that the band will not stay attached to the watch. The watch will just pop right out when I take it off. On one occasion it fell out when I put my child in the car seat. If I hadn't found it I obviously would have been left with only a band and no watch. Certainly not worth the money when the risk of loosing it is so great."
2,Not water resistant!,"I bought this watch less than a year ago, went swimming with it and it fogged up. It is NOT water resistant. I was very disappointed. Completely ruined the watch. Minus that fact everything else about the watch was great. I recommend NOT wearing it in the water."
2,Mediocre,"I've had two of these watches. Both suffered the same problem: The alarm stopped working after a while. The plastic straps peel off easily from the watch body. That's not a big deal--I can glue those on. But the alarm stopping is quite a drag. This is a cute watch for about a year, then it's just downhill from there. I will not be buying another."
1,NEVER again,"The display fogged up within a week. I got a replacement, and it's doing the same thing. Would NOT recommend this product."
3,The buttons are easily pressed,I like the feel and the color but the buttons are on the sides are easily pressed when I move around my wrist.
4,Great watch!,"I got this watch to help me with running, walking and yoga. It was a little difficult to figure out all of the set up, but I am thrilled with the end result.I recommend this product to any woman looking for a watch to use for multiple workout programs."
1,Strap is junk.,"Junk, junk, junk.The watch itself is good. However, at just over one year, the strap has completely given out. The plastic has separated from the watch making it unwearable. Don't bother. It's not worth it."
4,good watch good value,"Spent a lot of time comparing options and this watch was the best for its price. A little complicated to set, but I think I have the hang of it. I needed chrono, 2:1 interval training, lap memory and a good look.Nice surprise--the light is totally awesome for the early morning runs. Drawback--not the easiest to get off when I'm sweaty and the band is too plastic-y feeling.Overall very good watch for the money, I've had no trouble"
2,Watch Band Cleaning...?,"Has anyone found a way to clean the watch band of this or any other Timex watches (those with similar, plastic bands)? I've tried a variety of cleaning agents: soap/water, rubbing alcohol, white vinegar, distilled bleach, Fantastic, Windex...the list goes on. Nothing has seemed to work.I e-mailed the Timex company asking about cleaning instructions and received this e-mail:""There is not way to clean those type of watches, the watch color fades,we have to replace the complete unit when a consumer wants a new band.That charge is $10.00.Sincerely,Judy HillTimex Group USA Inc Customer Service. jh""Discouraging, however I find it hard to believe that Timex has created something totally ""uncleanable."" Has anyone found a way to clean these watch bands?"
4,Can withstand a washing in a washing machine!,"By mistake my new watch was part of a load of wash. I found it at the end of the cycle. It was ""foggy"" and even stopped for two hours later in the day, but then started again and lost the fog. It is good as new, though did get a bit scratched up..... and VERY clean."
2,"Functionality is great, but the strap does not last.","This would be a good watch if Timex would provide a better strap. The functions are easy to set and it has a great 'night light' that has lasted the year or so I've owned it. The trouble is the strap, it cracked and broke. The strap is glued to the watch body, so not replaceable. Come on, Timex, if you're going to attach cheap resin bands to your watches, at least make them replaceable."
3,"Functional, not pretty","I like the features on this watch, mainly I wanted something I could use to do timed running intervals and this accomplished that. My biggest complaint is that the band rapidly stained and changed color, so it looks dirty all the time. Because of that I only wear it for workouts."
1,Do not wear in the water.,I got this watch primarily for running for which it was fine. After having it for a month I went on vacation and did some water jogging with it on. It was not in the water an excessive amount of time perhaps 2 or 3 times for a half an hour but the displayed filled with water. The watch still worked but beeped every 30 seconds or so for another month at which point it stopped working. Yes it has a warranty but it doesn't include water damage. I find the fact that you can't wear in the water (even though it has a water resistent rating) curious for a triathlon watch.
3,band gets dirty,"Love the watch and its features, but, the light blue band gets dirty very easily. unable to get it clean. Next time i will buy a darker color"
1,Be careful,"I'm on my second timex womem's ironman triathalon sleek 50/100 watch and this one already fell apart. The first one completely died even with trying to put a brand new battery after getting caught in the rain while running. I got the same watch, giving it another chance because I really like the design. This time, the watch part just completely fell off of its band. The straps for the watch were not at all well designed and to my disbelief the whole thing just fell apart on me ... and its only been 3 mos. since the new watch! As much as I loved the design, I would highly NOT recommend this watch."
1,Bait and switch?????,"The watch I received was not as pictured. The item number was the same, but the watch case was light silver instead of the darker blue-grey and the buttons were a different color than pictured also. Not at all as attractive as the pictured item."
2,ok as a basic book but pretty uninspired,"This is a good general introduction to cryonic and nanotech life extension, but barely touches on a lot of the issues therein. Clearly written to be a popular piece instead of a ""substantial"" one. The Socratic question-and-answer format makes it seem more of a straw-man argument than one would hope. There are many better books on nanotech out there, and though I applaud the author for trying to raise public awareness of cryonics as legitimate science, he goes too far towards pop culture."
5,Portable urinal,"If you're grandparents who often have little passengers, this portable urinal is a terrific item to carry in your car. When there is nowhere for them to go to the potty, you can just get out ""The Red Bottle"" and stop along the roadside."
4,I use it for my Toddler Son,"I use this for my toddler son when we go out in public so he doesn't get pee everywhere. It is great to keep in the car and have your kids pee in the parking lot so you don't have a cart full of groceries and hear ""I gotta pee right now!"" It kinda leaks, so make sure you empty it out. Very cheaply made with rough edges, but I just used some sandpaper to smooth them out and it was just fine. It is a lot cheaper than the other brand that looks just like it. I also got the Go Girl flexible urinal for peeing when we camp in the cold and that works great when my 21 month old son has to pee in public too :)"
4,portable potty,Although I have not yet used this item yet(I purchased it for hunting purposes when you can't get down from the treestand in order to 'go')it seems of good quality. THanks.
1,worst experience,i placed this order like over a month ago and im still waiting for my order and so far i haven't been contacted by the seller or amazon to give me a reason for delay. i've sent emails and tried to call but no answers as of yet. this is the worst expeirence ever.
2,Don't Buy The Compatible One,"It is worth to buy the real one, I learned it the hard way. Pay the extra money. It is worth it."
2,Poor quality product,"I purchased this new drum for my Sharp AL1631 copier that gets light usage, less than 30 copies per week. It worked fine for a week then started leaving blank areas on copes down the center of the page. In addition to that, the end of the unit fell off and two gears fell out. It took me a while to figure out how to reinstall the gears to make the drum work, but the blank spots continued. I thought that it may be the new toner cartridge that I had installed at the same time, but even after purchasing a second new toner cartridge, the blank spots are still there. The first 2 or 3 copies are fine, then the blank gets wider and wider. I finally decided to just buy a new copier and stop spending money on new parts and supplies. Of course, this was what I was trying to avoid in the first place."
1,Drum no good !,Replacement drum worked for about 3 weeks then failed. Had to spend a lot of money for a repair technician to come out. He said the drum I had bought online was no good. He guessed that it had been exposed to light prior to being sold! Bottom line I had to dig deep into my pockets to have my amazon drum replaced within a month.Don't waste your time or money with this product!
4,Great Product.,"The BP cuff works well. Good, tight velcro fit and clear, readable gauge. Highly recommend this item for entry level use. Good value also."
5,Ready to Write and Develop Motor Skills,"I would highly recommend this book and any of the others in the series, for parents or teachers of young children. The activities are easy, active and fun to set up and play with your children! Almost everything you will need to make each activity you can find around your house! The concepts are developmentally appropriate and extremely engaging."
4,review I -MD,"For a person with a high arch and skinny heel, I have had a really hard time finding a fashion athletic shoe that fits right and stays put! This style is great - love the larger criss cross elastic straps."
3,Pretty good end of the world flick.,"Not bad. Nothing too original however but entertaining none the less. Two sisters and their random friends they find along the way are captured but a crazed, post apocalyptic family. Movie is originally in German and dubbed over fairly well in English. FYI, this movies is available under the title ""Apocalypse"" at Walmart."
3,Hell,Everybody who likes post apocalyptic movies this is for you. The down side is they made the movie in germany it's not subtitled but the actors speak in german their lips move like a chinese film but every actor has a different american voice.
2,Neither Terrifying nor Suspenseful,"More like boring and predictable. The production values were pretty good, as far as the setting and filming goes, but the story line falls flat. The overdubbing is pretty bad, too. The voices fit the characters fairly well, with a few exceptions, but it's basically like all of the characters are standing in the same room throughout the entire movie. There's no difference in volume due to distance, etc. I'd be curious to see if I would have had a different opinion of the film if it had used subtitles instead. I think it was a big mistake not to spend more time in production when placing the overdubs. Still very predictable, though. At least it was only $9.99 new at Best Buy. Sigh."
4,Works great for us.,We have used this in the boat and on car trips and it worked fine based on a recommendation from a friend. Also heater part worked good as well. For the money we found it to do a good job. Didn't want to spend $100+ for some of the high end ones when this did the trick.
3,worked ok,"Bought this ""like new"" from a yard sale. Wasn't expecting much after seeing the other reviews but it seemed to work ok for us. It kept cold food cold during a 9 hour drive and did not make much noise or blow hot air on the back seat passengers. The drawbacks are the cooler compartment isn't that large, it has to be plugged in to the lighter jack to work (so you can't have another appliance in the car, and it will draw off your battery when you park) and there is no way to plug it into an electrical socket if you want to use it in a hotel room. Overall we were fairly happy with it and will continue using it on our trips."
5,i loved ricky segall,i want his albums from the 70's with his parents. anyone who knows how i can get them in any form please email me. thanks. Pauline_potter@msn.com
1,Junk,"This is a poorly constructed product which uses only 1/2"" hose. Mine stopped retracting the hose after only a month. Mounting is awkward, end pressure is mediocre unless you are starting with very high pressure.Would not buy from this manufacturer again."
5,"""Beastly Tales"" out of Print, AN INTERNATIONAL DISGRACE","Everything is great about these poems. The rhymes are clever, beautiful and very often funny. In the tales the good wins from the bad, but after trial and tribulations, and always in unexpected ways. One of my favourite lines is about a goat and a ram: ""They ate with pride as if to balance, their total lack of other talents"". But quoting excellent lines would take about as long as the book itself.These are not children's rhymes, but I read them to my sons of 10 and 13 years old and we all three have a great time."
5,Too Enchanting!,"This is a fun story that children 1 1/2 years and up couldenjoy, but it is the illustrations that really steal the show. Theyare the best I've seen so far in a children's book, and we have quite a few. The colors are wonderful and the style of drawing reminds me of Curious George goes to art school. Treat yourself and your child!"
2,pistachio nuts,"The nuts were packaged in individual packs which was good, however the quality of the nuts was poor. The shells on half of them were not open enough such that I had to use a nut cracker to get them open. The nuts themselves were not good,small,over baked, inedible."
2,Not essential,"This collection of very early Genesis is mostly pleasant pop music with some psychedelic rock touches, but the songs are products of their time (1967-1968) and the entire album can be replaced by one song: a hit single from Marmalade, ""Reflections of My Life"", which is similar in tone but more fulfilling. Still, this compilation is worth a listen, if only to hear what a teenaged Genesis and Peter Gabriel sounded like."
3,Decent reflective vest,"I like the reflective aspect of the vest and the size is perfect for my 5'1"" frame but unfortunately, the side straps always loosen up on me. They are pretty thin like grosgrain ribbon so the cinch doesn't stay put. I am constantly adjusting when I am running. It might bother me more than other people, though. Otherwise, they were just what I was looking for."
4,Very bright good runners vest,"Light, bright, easy to run in. Had to ""tie"" the longer bits of fabric where the adjustable straps are as they are slippy and kept working loose.Mesh construction makes it very breathable.I have attached led lights front and back and they stay put extremely well and make the vest even more visible.Overall very happy with this purchase"
4,Body Rides,"The book was totally awesome. It was definantly a page turner and you certainly didn't want to put it down. The only bad thing about the book was the ending. It was a little surprising and disapointing but, it happens."
4,Thrilling and Unique,"Unlike Stephen King, Richard Laymon knows how to write an ending. This book is a little slow in the middle, but the beginning is like riding a rocket. I was reading at lightning speed and had the biggest grin on my face. Laymon's books are just so much fun! Extremely gory, sexually graphic, and refreshingly unpredictable, BODY RIDES is among the best of his books (IN THE DARK, ISLAND, NO SANCTUARY are just a few). If I was ever stranded on an island and allowed to read only one author, Richard Laymon would be the one."
2,Sex Sex and more Sex,"Started this book and was really into it. It starts off with Neal the main character going to the video store to turn some in late at night in LA. He hears a woman scream who is nude and being tortured by a maniac. He shoots the maniac saving the woman and she gives him a bracelet with magical powers to leave your body and enter anothers. She gets killed anyway because the maniac wasn,t dead as thought and kills her at her home. The story continues going well and just wondering what will happen now. Then he meets a young girl in a restarant who is a waitress and she finds out about the bracelet. Neal now goes on a adventure with this girl even though he had a girlfriend at home. Now for about a hundred and fifty pages its nothing but sex. Then to top it off hes girlfriend at home ends up liking the idea of his new girl joining in there sex games. So now he has the two of them for sex. Storyline was great but if I wanted a porno book I would have got one. Very disappointed."
3,Good plot goes nowhere,"Body Rides was an okay story, just okay. I'll admit the plot was very different and unique. I felt the plot could have been expanded a little more, considering its uniqueness. The ending was a crappy one and there were scenes in the story which seemed useless and out of place to the plot."
5,Blasticks Plastic Handle,"Great brushes. I had them for one month and they seem sturdy enough. Something between standard wire brushes and sticks. They sound wonderful on the rider cymbal and they are adjustable, so you can get a variety of sounds. I use them ""full open"". If you need a soft touch these are it."
3,I guess zebras look different to other zebras...,"To my ears much of this album sounds the same in tempo, tone and approach. Its pleasant enough but the instrumentation: sax, drums and bass are just too limited in tone/timbre to provide much variety and the playing while very good is limited in dynamic or emotional range. The songs blend into one another in a foggy haze with little to set them apart from one another. Konitz is a motherf*cker on the sax though."
4,"unusual line up, great record","Pairing Lee Konitz and Elvin Jones seems like a strange idea, especially considering the different directions they were heading in jazz at the time of this recording, but it works. Konitz seems to be so concerned with improvisation on this session that he can't be bothered with even playing the heads; I dare you to figure out what some of these songs are without looking at the case. ""Motion"" is the perfect name for this record, since Jones keeps the music moving with his skittering drum work and Dallas comes along with the ride (he's the one here that seems most concerned with following the standard changes, and keeps the whole thing from getting too out of hand). This record would be difficult to listen to in one sitting, (three CDs) but is consistently enjoyable, even with multiple aternate takes."
5,Loved this book,"I loved reading this book. It is well written and everything in it is useful. Parts of it bring back memories of my childhood. I wish we could all slow down, remember our etiquette and be more gracious."
2,Aren't charm and manners available to everyone?,"This book is DEFINITELY for you if you want your coaching in the social graces served up with a generous dollop of Christianity, including a story of a cook who prayed ""Dear Lord, You are in the redemption business. Please redeem this turkey"". However, if you're like me, preferring etiquette books to be available to all, regardless of faith, you may want to look elsewhere for a book dealing with charm and manners."
1,Basically - useless!,"Firstly - why this is categorised as a 'TOY' is beyond me.Having said that, as (in my opinion) it's pretty useless as an alternative to chemicals.I live in the tropics, with 90 degree heat and almost constant sunshine. Throw in tropical rainstorms and you have the perfect recipe for green pool algae. So I purchased a floatron, paid for international shipping, then had to pay 'import duty' and 'customs handling' (welcome to the Philippines), and $500 later dropped it into my pool.Didn't seem to make ANY difference whatsoever!It still floats! It still offers a reasonable amount of amusement when my daughter invites her friends over, so maybe a TOY is the best description after all.Basically a HUGELY expensive (for me anyway) waste of money."
3,Floatron - is it safe?,"I am concerned with the safety of this gizmo. It appears to release copper into the water that kills off the algae but doesn't hurt humans. Copper is one of the ingredients used in wood preservative and certainly wood preservative is not good for humans. How can it kill off algae and yet be OK for us? Just because it has no smell, like chlorine, doesn't mean it is safe,One of the reviewers mentioned that he noticed a blue tinge in his children's hair. What is that all about?Does it have any certification from a recognized health or safety authority? I have not seen any such quality assurance rating in any of the product literature that I've seen.I guess it works but at what price to our health?"
1,It kills algae but it makes kois sick,"I've a Koi pond and bought this product based on Amazon reviews and the product web site saying that it's safe to use in Koi pond.The product works in that it cleaned up my pond by killing algage but it also made my Kois sick.Basically, the product releases toxic(copper)slowly which if I had known, I wouldn't have bought. Also, this product is banned to be used in Spa. These important facts should have been disclosed and copper test kits should have been provided instead of misleading Ion test kits.I don't recommend this product for Koi ponds. Even for swimming pools, I've doubt on the safety."
1,Don't Buy this item,"The Floatron Natural Pool Cleaner so far doesn't work. No copper ions are detected in my pool even though the pool is in full sunlight. I foolishly didn't send this back during the 30 day return period, so I am not sure what I am going to do as this was very expensive."
2,Didnt get a chance....,"I had a small problem with my unit and sent the seller 2 emails which were not returned to date. I had to return this item and thankfully Amazon took care of that for me. As far as using this it was in my pool for 2 days and took on a little water in the unit and the solar panels. Since the seller never got back to me I returned the cleaner and now Im back to using chemicals again. I sooo much wanted to try this thing out. I had saved up the money to buy it but when I needed help the seller was no where to be heard from. Sorry folks. My experience was not a good one. That doesnt mean this thing dont work, its just I didnt get a chance to use mine."
2,It does not seem to do anything,"I used the test kit to test copper ion level after 2 weeks, it shows no color change. Algae level is about the same and I have to scrub the swimming pool weekly. It looks like an expensive toy more than a cleaner."
2,flowtron,not totally impressed. was at the end of my pool season and tried it for a week or so. pool turned cloudy and green even though chems were in order. not really sure. seems like it caused algae... and a white ring around pool. took it out last week to ready for closing and pool is clear this week with no chemicals??? any ideas??
2,Not Happy,"We purchased our Floatron a while back and had to send it back last month, because it was taking on water and was not working according to the test method. They told us to drill a hole in the bottom of the Floatron and send it back. They sent us the same one back with white paint on the top and with a plugged hole in the bottom where I had to remove the water. I tested it again and it still does not work. I was happy for a year and a half. We are dissatisfied with the company."
5,Very pleased,"I fought algae in my pool for 10 years. Spent a fortune on chemicals and Kreepy Krauley parts. Nothing was effective.Bought the Floatron as a last resort, figured I was just about to waste $300. WRONG! Best investment I ever made. My pool is about 40 years old. In ground plaster.After 2 weeks, I stopped using chlorine... well, I use 2 of the hockey puck tabs a week, so a bucket of those tabs lasts 2 years.The water in my pool is crystal clear. I replace the electrode about once every 16 months.I've read reviews by people who seem to get hung up on the Ion reading. I've checked mine once in 3 years. The water is clear and clean, who cares about the ion level?I'm very, very happy with this thing."
2,Seems to work... company not fun to deal with,"I am a firm believer in ionization for pools. I have had this for almost 2 years and it seems to work. The test always shows up low but I see there is some color on the test. It sure puts a lot of crud in my DE filter. I open the filter and pieces of ""stuff"" and definitely blue are in there. I am having to clean the DE filter more often. I have to clean this thing once a week. And now it seems to be picking up a lot of metals in the water which I guess is good but the cleaning is really a burden. Also, I tethered it fairly near my pool light and the chrome turned black.When I first got it I had questions because it never tested at all... seemed to help but the test never showed color and when I called these people were very unhelpful and basically treated me like a moron.I like the idea but before I buy a new element I would like to look into other ionization products...Floatron Natural Pool Cleaner Algae-free No chemicals"
2,Hasn't worked yet,"Well my Floatron has been floating in my new pool (35,000 gallons) for 3 weeks under 12 hours of direct sun per day and when I do the test to check the ion level it is still zero. If this thing is supposed to work it had better start soon or I will use it for target practice."
1,No difference whatsoever!,"I've had this floating in my pool for just over 1 year and I must admit to not noticing the slightest difference since before it was used.I live in the tropics (Philippines) and my pool is used all year in HOT sunshine and tropical downpours. Without frequent addition of chemicals my pool will be green in 4 to 5 days!I know it's doing something because the copper element needs cleaning quite often, but as an alternative to chemicals......sorry.....didn't work!On the plus side.....at least it still floats!"
2,Good for a short time,"I used the chainsaw for half a day and it worked great. Enough power for branches and small trees. Then it quit. I opened it up and one of the wire going to the brushes was disconnected. Could not find an easy way to reconnect as it seems it was just stuck in a hole before. Tried my best to reattach, including soldering, but it quit again after a couple of hours, most likely same problem. It's not easy to take it apart and at the age of 72 I have cut a good 40 cords of beetle infested Ponderosas in my life (which kept me warm for 14 years), with a 36"" gas chainsaw that I took apart a number of time, but it took me about 3 hours to get to this connection. Also when you store the saw, you are supposed to drain the oil or it makes a mess in your garage. It's much easier to fill cleanly than to drain cleanly!"
2,Parts hard to find or buy,"The saw cuts OK, but finding a second chain has been ridiculous. Once the original chain got dull, I tried to buy a new one. Priced at $32.95!!!! Over half the price of the tool!!! Cannot buy anywhere but on line. Chips in the housing is also a pain - you have to dig them out regularly or disassemble the shield to get them out. I do not recommend this saw for anyone other than a person who can only handle a light weight saw for small jobs."
3,Title,"It cuts, but if the wood is not completely dry, the wood chips compact in the drive housing. It has to be disassembled after each cut and the chips cleaned out. Not a very good design."
3,Essential Bach is OK,This is a good basic primer. A true Bach lover might find a better selection/orchestra.
5,Good,This is a good album but for information on real choral music visit www.freewebs.com/bachster67/
5,Genius Bach,The great of Bach - get to know himNeeds education on Bach? Get this CD and enjoy his beautiful music with a good Martini
5,"The Essential, Supreme Bach","No other composer has produced such glorious music as J.S. has. This summary of his work is fine introduction and review. My aged ears won't allow critical analysis of one professional performance over another, so I'm happy with all of them."
5,Excellent Movie!!,"This is one of the great and timeless films of all time. I never thought that Willie Nelson could act and now I ""know"" he can't. But, the fact that the film includes his own band really makes it great. And what man couldn't look at Dyan Cannon all day long??"
2,Rhetorical Gibberish,"I really did try to get into the book and I read quite a few of the essays. Mr. Gould had some interesting facts and analogies to convey, but the overall theses of his many articles lack any cogent argument. He uses words well and obviously has a great deal of knowledge about natural history, but to extract exactly what he is trying to argue (and I mean exactly)is difficult at best. He basically hides his assertions through lengthy metaphors, mounds of factual tidbits (that are alas not clearly germaine to the argument) and syrupy rhetoric. In the end, a disappointing read, though I am glad I gave it a shot."
2,no size of item,"with hundreds of different air clenaers , they should have the dia size in inches so you can make an decision on weather or not it will fit your car."
2,broken to pieces,every bag of crackers so far has been broken to bits. i'm about half way through my order as now.
1,Perhaps the worst cracker I've ever had.,"I enjoy eating snack items that are somewhat healthy (baked chips, veggie crisps, pita chips, rice cakes, etc). I saw these Rye and Flax crackers at a local store and decided to try them. I love rye bread and figured it might taste similar. Wow, I was very wrong. These are probably the worst-tasting cracker I've ever had. The rye flavor was not strong at all. While they were crispy, they just had a bland taste and also left a bad after taste in my mouth. It felt like eating card board (as imagined). I guess the one benefit is the health factor."
4,"Even in pieces, they're delicious","I, too, have noticed that this line of crackers (Blue Star Farms) tends to break more easily, and for this I've dropped a star, but the Rye & Flax in particular is really delicious, different (a break from ubiquitous wheat), and excellent with cheeses as well as for eating on their own. It's a unique taste that I include with other crackers and breads when putting together a cheese plate, and provides nice flavor contrast.If they can fix the breakage problem, they've got a 5-Star product!ps: Be advised that this product does contain wheat."
1,BORING!,This book was so boring. I don't understand why it needed to be written. My hats off to people who finished it. It just didn't appeal to me or make sense to me. And WAY TOO fictional for my tastes....
3,a great fairy-tale with no regard for central facts,"Creative & perhaps insightful but alas, based on pseudo-scholarship & modern feminist fantasy- especially in supposing there was a thriving Goddess-cult in 1st century AD Palestine *G*"
3,A good bok that leaves a lot out,"I really enjoyed this book, but I was disapointed by the fact that it doesn't reflect the diversity of the region in which it is set. The book challenges the place of women in Christianity and the Bible but the only character of color is a Black man who is a eunuch and the servant/slave of the main character. The books is supposed to take place in Persia and ancient Israel, but the most important characters are described as having fair skin, lights eyes blue, green, hazel) and straight hair. Miss Kinstler isn't stepping to far outside modern beauty standards. It is an enjoyable read, just keep in mind what Arabic, African, and Persian people really look like. A great companion to this book is the SAcred Prostitute by Nancy Qualls-Corbett. It gives more detailed information of the goddesses mentioned in The Moon Under Her Feet."
5,"Very nice designs, but check errata on author's webpage","Very nice designs -totally wearable, but still interesting.Lots of typos and mistakes -make sure to check eratta [...] , before knitting."
4,Hip Knit Hats,Love the knitting book Hip Knit Hats. The patterns are a step up in design and quick to knit. Have to agree with some of the other reviews concerning the instructions. They have a few errors and might cause problems for a beginner. All in all its a great book and glad I made the purchase. I recommend it!
4,Best Hat book I've seen,"After searching for ages for a really good hat pattern book, I finally found it. This is packed with really wearable good hats. Some of the patterns are quite fancy, whilst others are just good solid beanies with variations suggested. The patterns come in medium and large, and there is a page at the front which helps with giving you combinatins of yarn to produce the same result at the end. Allows for creativity and I would highly recommend this book."
5,This book will greatly increase your hat collection!,"I was in love with the hats in the book, but read the Amazon reviews and decided to find out about the errata. I ended up waiting to buy the 5th edition and all the errors had been corrected. I have made the Valery hat (everyone loves this), the Beau, the Nina and even felted the Sophie. It has been the most useful knitting book I have purchased. I have let friends borrow it also and they love it. I like the pattern directions for knitting it top down, but it takes a little getting used to. This book is definitely worth the money."
3,Cute Hats; Incomplete Lessons,"I wanted to likek this book more than I did. I like the hat ideas in this book very much and, as others have noted, the variations on size and yarn it deals with.BUT, despite being quite an experienced knitter, I found it impossible to learn the intriguing-sounding wrap cast-on technique from this book. Not only that, I couldn't even follow Carron's instructions for the long tail cast on -- which I already know how to do!In the next edition, she needs to have someone actually try to follow these instructions, and then revise them to make them more user-friendly. She might take a look at the way instructions are done in Stitch and Bitch (drawings) or Melville's Knitting Experience boks (photos) to get a better handle on making them easier to follow."
1,Not What I Was Hoping,"I love the hat on the front of the cover and wanted to make it, but all of the hats in this book start at the top of the hat.I prefer to start at the bottom and the directions were a bit more involved than what I had hoped. If you are interested in felting, this books gives lots of ideas."
4,"Great hats, but with a lot of editing flaws","While I love this book and Cathy's hats, I find it annoying that on the 4th edition of this book it still has many editing flaws. On some of the patterns ""materials used,"" and what was actually used do not match. This caused me to order yarn that was incorrect, and was not usable for this project. For example, she mentions blue multi for the bret when in fact the name of the yarn is called deep blue (per yarndex #76). Also, have had to order the exact yarn to have the hat turn out correctly. Instructions are not always clear. Cathy should have also given pictures of how to do the bobble. I had to watch a video on youtube in order to understand what she was trying to describe.Both my sister and I have ordered this book, and are somewhat dissapointed with the way in which it is written. The author is not always articulate which leaves the reader having to disect the material."
4,Great in spite of errors,"I agree with some previous posters. The basic hat design has a mistake in the first row of increases and if you aren't experienced enough to catch it, it would be too discouraging to try to work thorugh. One pattern I tried had some bad mistakes toward the end that I was able to work around by just lookig at the picture and making my way along, but a novice would probably just toss it aside.That being said, the patterns are adorable and they really DO look great on the wearer. I'd even give the book as a gift after downloading the corrections and making a clear disclaimer.The fiber industry is probably glad I found the book because I have bought LOADS of bulky and chunky yarns to play with these designs."
1,Hip Knit Hats,"I bought this book because the hats were so cute. I have made the ""Bobbi"" hat three times and ripped it apart three times because the bobbles did not line up. I finally decided to look online to see if anyone else had problems with this pattern. I found that the author, Cathy Carron, has posted corrections to 15 of the 40 patterns on her website. Unbelievable. So I now have the corrections and can make the hat successfuly. Also unbelievable is that this is the 4th edition of this book. I will never buy another book by this author again until I read a review assuring me that it is error free."
3,Too many errors...,"This is a beautiful book, full of great hat patterns. I've had the book a year and just recently decided to knit one of the patterns. I came to the realization something was wrong with the instructions. I asked at my local yarn store and they found errors. We then did a search for Errata online and found MANY corrections to many pages. This is a real shame. I'm still fairly new to knitting and don't like spending a lot on a book like this. To me, it is not worth the money. I can't believe the designer of these patterns didn't review every single pattern when working this book with the publisher."
1,Duvet not as advertised - do not buy,The duvet is barely flannel - it is so thin I can't believe it was advertised as flannel. The sham is much thicker than the duvet. It was also received with a layer of thick dust on the folded up duvet even though it was zipped up in a clear plastic bag. I would recommend staying away from this product.
2,IT IS NICE BUT!!,"It is soft and feels sooooo good!!! BUT the Burgundy sheeds like a cat it is all over the floor, my hair, the red fur is every were!!! I only get one pillow cast and one sheet like thing !!! I have 2(two) pillows please! in the photo it looks like two of every thing!! Help me here!! where is the other one??"
5,Mind Blowing,"All I can say is... ""wow"". Truly a gifted writer/illustrator, Brad Teare sends you on a powerful trip through destiny and defeat. A must read"
1,Poorly Written,"I found this book to be one of the worst I have read in a long time. Patti Wollman is shameless looking to capitalize on her rather boring and uninsightful experiences as a teacher. Frankly, I am glad my kids did not suffer under her tutelage. Its only redeeming feature is that it is out of stock."
5,Don't wait for the future,I've spent numerous afternoons with this haunting album and I love it more each time. Definitely the kind of album you want as part of the soundtrack of your life.
5,Son loves these books!,"My son loved this one so much, we had to travel all over our area to find the other Road Weenie book, Campfire Weenies, I believe it's called."
4,Another great book!,"This book is the sequel to David Lubar's Land of the Lawn Weenies. Lubar does not focus on one story, but rather many short stories. Each story is meant to be scary to some degree, however I enjoyed Invasion of the Road Weenies more for it's creative and interesting stories. It's a nice light read and is great for any age that can read!There are only a couple downs to this book, which is why it's four stars. First, the book is much shorter than Land of the Lawn Weenies. This book may not grab the attention of the reader because each story is not relevant to eachother, making no suspense after one story. Don't get me wrong though, it's still a great book!Though the title seems a little odd, it's a great book to read anytime. I'm sure you will enjoy these short stories, and therefor, Lubar has just earned himself a four star review.P.S. David's next title might be about bike weenies :P"
3,Good book,"This book is comprehensive and has quality information. However, I felt that the author stretched the analogies way too far, the tests were not comprehensive or useful (a CROSSWORD PUZZLE? sheesh), and the testing software turned out to be useless after two or three times - the software tests do not change: the same questions come up over and over, and with three or four tries all (few) questions are memorized. Check out the New Rider's Publishing books on getting your CNE before getting one of these - the tests are better, and no miserable analogies."
5,I felt like sitting next to the author while he was teaching,"They called me a book worm.I love books since I was a child.I always learned from my books, learned how to behave,and all the qualities of an examplary human being.Till now when I have reached final year of my graduation in computer engineering I have kept my books since I was 10.And when I went through CNE STUDY GUIDE, I admit that I've never read any book like that before. Infact I have never been tought that way before.I felt like the author is siting in my room, right next to me, and teaching me.The proof of my words are that I passed 2 tests1. Netware Administration (CNA)2. Netware Installation amd configuration Workshoponly by studying this book and I am confidant that I can pass the third test (advanced administration) without taking expensive preparatory classes.This book saved alot of my money, almost 550$ till now.For me this book will remain immortal throughout my life.Truly a great book.Javaid Ahmed Soomro"
3,"Not Magic, Not High, Not High Magic.","Despite the title, this book is a work predominately based on and emphasising sorcery.It is not a true magic text and not a text based on high magic as the title claims.The author has included a mixed bag of techniques from different traditions and sources.That said, he gives some differing perspectives and explanations on sigil magic and the workings of the subconscious and conscious minds, and some techniques not found in other books, such as the magic gaze.The book attempts to cover a lot of ground and would give someone an overview of various techniques which are common to most magicians.It is though based on the paradigm of Chaos magic and has the intention of following methods which fall on the side of sorcery and not magic."
2,Not as advertised,The product was to be 9-ounce bags (Pack of 24). I received a little plastic wrapped bundle of 6 (9-ounce bags). I told Amazon about this. They apologized for the error and said they would re-ship. About a week later I received another little plastic wrapped bundle of 6 (9-ounce bags). I give up!!!!
2,Works OK,"Doesn't do the best job but it's better than nothing. If your wine is really warm, it won't even get it close to cold enough. Wouldn't buy again."
3,Decent,"Bought for pooch for camping. Gave it 3 stars only because the pillow sags all the way to the ground, so what's the point of the frame? After first year of camping, we ended up just throwing the pillow on the ground next to the campfire and dog likes that much better than with the frame."
1,Poor design! Will not work with weight limit designated!,Poor quality and product. will not work with weight limit designated. Do not buy this be unless your dog weighs under 25 lbs.!!!Will be returning this bed!
4,Love it but not for dogs up to 100lbs...,"I purchased two large loungers for my two dogs (55lbs & 62lbs). My 55lb dog laid on the lounger and was touching the floor. I wouldn't recommend for a larger dog (product says it can hold up to 100lbs). I purchased these as travel beds since they fold up nicely and are easier to transport than big, bulky dog beds. I think they are still great and will work well for our intended use."
3,SH Definitive Col.,I found most of the movies very good but found there are some with no audio and watched the as silent movies. All in all the set was very good.
2,Way too salty and damaged.,"Too much salt. C'mon it's easy to add more salt if we want but this is nasty, how can you remove salt? exactly. This is so over salted, very sad. And sad, that Amazon has thus far delivered only badly dented cans from my 4 orders of these soups. --NOT DAMAGED IN SHIPMENT TO ME, the box was perfect."
4,Quality amongst canned soups,"I bought these during a crazy sale, and as a quick meal option, I think it's quite healthy and nutritious. Also has pretty much no salt, which I like since you can always add it yourself!"
1,not impressed,"Decided to try one of these since they were on sale at the natural food store and I'm very disappointed. I am a huge fan of Amy's organic lentil soup and this stuff does not compare. This stuff has more salt, less fat and much less flavor (other than the flavor of salt). Stick with Amy's if you have the choice."
2,Every single can was smash,the soup was OK but the packaging did not protect the cans all were severely dented I would never accept these at my supermarket
5,They'll think you cooked,"This soup is delicious, and, if this is important to you, appears to be free of animal products. Put a can in your lunchbag with a heel of bread, and if there's a microwave (and a can opener) at your workplace, you're set."
4,Makes a difficult process easy,"I know nothing about web design, and don't really want to do it myself. But, I was interested in being able to update one particular page, created by a professional, on my own, and save myself some $$ in the process. I tried two other programs, and got nowhere with them. Contribute 3 was my third attempt, and made it possible to make the modifications with virtually no hassle. My first updates were accomplished in about 5 minutes, and my subsequent ones have taken perhaps 30 seconds.I have not explored all the bells and whistles of the program yet. But, at least for my simple needs the program works very well, and is easy to use. For that I'm thankful and grateful."
2,"Definately don't pay full price, but still a nice book to have.","I liked that they included so many artists, and had some good interview questions asked.. in that way it seems a bit like a magazine more than an actual art criticism book. But I'd have to agree with one of the other comments about the quality not doing it justice. Many of the art pieces are rendered in a way that does makes the colors look dark and the detail gets lost. I guess it's considered cheap for an art book, but for me, it was an investment, I surely can't afford the art and I can barely afford to buy a $30 book, and I was so excited at the time I bought it. Just wanted to help make sure nobody gets disappointed like I did."
3,Classic Reynolds.,"It's a late 70's Burt Reynolds movie. What else do I need to say? I liked it fine. It's like after shooting Smokey And the Bandit the director said, ""nobody leave, let's shoot another movie"". Sally Field is even in it again. Here Burt plays a stuntman, but it's basically the same person as half his other films from those years. I'm not knocking it, this is why I like Burt Reynolds. It walks the comedy/action line. If you liked Cannonball Run or Stroker Ace, here's another one."
3,An interesting period piece.,"I enjoyed watching this film again. I think the important thing to understand is that Burt represents the hard drinking, pill popping, reckless way of the ""old school"" stunt man, where as Jan Michael Vincent represents the non-drinking, non pill popping, cool ways of the ""new school"" stunt man...... and taken in that context the movie's rather blatant excesses become more relevant.Obviously filmed on a rather limited budget, the stunts aren't spectacular, but still fun none-the-less. It's too bad this is only available in the full screen version.Sally Field is exceedingly cute in this film and worth the price of admission!Not a great film, but a fun film and worth a couple of bucks."
3,Reynolds is a one man Rat Pack,"I saw Hooper in the theater when I was about 9 years old. It is still just as corny as I remember. In all honesty, the movie isn't very good. What was the biggest surprise, was how good the movie looked on DVD. The original print must have been in great shape, because I doubt a lot of money was spent restoring this one. Anyway... pop open a Coors and sit back and enjoy Burt in his prime."
3,What kind of convention? A convention of a-holes?,"Great flick! I don't have much to say that hasn't been already (I loved the ""one man Rat Pack"" line!). This film is like a party; everyone seems to be in on some kind of joke (they're all obviously friends, part of the Reynolds/Needham gang). On top of that, they appear to be mildly drunk much of the time!I too would love to see a special edition of this flick. There used to be a TV version that had a ton of extra footage, so I know it's out there someplace."
1,Poor quality and reliability,I bought two of these for my Subaru and one failed after about a year and a half and one was dead on arrival. I am going with NGK/NTK to replace them.
1,It is not progressive metal!,Can it be that two bands have the same name? Just got this CD and it is full of rap! Not a sign of progressive rock. Does anybody know what is up with this?
1,Very elementary book,"The contents are too basic, not of any use for a graduate student. I am very upset to have bought this very very elementary book. You would not need this book if you have access to internet to google ""bode"", ""rlocus"" MATLAB commands. There are lots of better Matlab examples in Dorf.- Ramin Shamshiri, Dec.2009."
5,A good introduction to Matlab for Control Systems Applications,"I used Katsuhiko Ogata's Control Sustems Engineering textbook back in College, an I loved it.This book is an excellent companion to practice and learn the use of Matlab to resolve Control Systems problems. Together you will have A true introductory couple to Control Engineering"
2,Not all it promised,"I had expected when I bought this that the tip covers would snap onto the couplers. But, that's not the case. While you can, indeed, cover your tip, the cover falls off when you pick up the bag. So, if you're just placing the bag in a corner and need something to place over the tip this should work. But, if you want it to stay in place so you can take the bag with you (to a class, for example) this is not what you need."
5,Absolutly stunning!,"The art is wonderful. The coloring is stunning. The stories are highly entertaining. There is no reason for me to go on because the preceding reviews say it best - ""Hellboy"" is fabulous entertainment. If you have any interest in Graphic Novels or the comic medium then ""Hellboy"" needs to be on your bookshelf."
2,Book came in damaged condition,"When I got this the spine of the book was sliced down the middle, as if someone had opened a box that it was contained in and cut the book in the process. Also there were dents on the spine. The binding also makes that awful cracking noise when you open the book, which I believe means it has the same crappy binding as the first book and will fall apart. The quality of the story is much higher than the production."
3,A solid collection of Hellboy tales!!,"I was never able to warm up to Mike Mignola's art until I saw his creation, Hellboy. It looks so perfect that when someone else draws him it seems wrong to me. Here there are various Hellboy tales from a few different sources and they're all pretty good. While the collection isn't very cohesive it still lends itself well to Hellboy's world. Overall, a very solid read."
2,My say,Book okay...informative ...but projects are not that great..nothing really for experienced knitters...should show more of book when sampling ....would not have bought this book had I been able to view more.
4,Frank Stallone is Good!!,"Frank Stallone's Debut is very good. This cd was released in 1984 on the Polydor label. Frank has also sung on Rocky II & III, Staying Alive, Over The Top & Rambo II soundtracks. If you like Lite AOR music this is one you should check out. The problem is, it is very hard to find. But it is worth the find."
3,"Good watch, but not the durability I expect","For the first year that I had this watch, it was great. Good features, nice style, no complaints.Then after about a year, the watchband started becoming detached from the watch face! It seems like it snaps on there, but also has some glue holding it in place. Once the glue started to fail, the watchband kept popping off of the buttons - first just one segment, eventually three with the fourth weakening. I had some luck reattaching the band with rubber cement, but it's definitely not as good, not to mention it looks lousy.Stylistically, the non-detachable watchband looks great, but it just isn't durable, and you can't replace it, so once it breaks this watch is useless. I'm very disappointed to be looking at retiring a Timex Ironman within two years of purchase when, back in the day, my Ironman watch lasted me ten years until I lost it."
2,"Great watch, poor band","I love the watch itself, but will not buy another one because the band just does not last. It comes off of the side buttons that hold it, and thus, cannot be used, or replaced. If Timex would fix the band, it would be perfect, but without the band, it's worthless after 4-6 months."
4,"Comfortable, easy to set but alarm is too soft","This watch is great, unless you need a loud alarm. The alarm and timer beeps at a very high pitch and not very loudly. It is sleek, comfortable to wear and very easy to set. I especially like the up / down options when setting time / alarm / timer and the ""restart"" option for the timer. Personally I bought it for refereeing soccer but the alarm at the end of the timer countdown is way too soft to hear on the pitch. So I'd recommend the watch, but not if you plan to rely on it as an alarm clock or timer."
3,"Love the watch, hate the band","This is my third or fourth watch of this type. It's a great watch, but the band will fail well before the watch does."
4,Great watch!,"Works well and is nice looking and comfortable on the wrist. I've had similar models before, and I've always liked it. The colors for this one are nice. The only thing that is a little weird are the buttons. They don't depress very much, so I can't always tell by feel whether I've actually pressed them or not."
2,Condensation under lens in less than 5 months,"Love the watch design, but the warranty requires me to return it to the merchant instead of Amazon. Due to costs to send the watch for repair, it makes more sense to buy a new watch - but this time not from Amazon. (It doesn't seem to help to pay extra for the protection plan). I like Amazon for many things, but now I've decided to not buy watches from them anymore."
2,"Nice watch, bad band","I've had Timex Ironman watches for years, but this band style is really prone to breakage.No issues with the watch performance, just the plastic band, which pops apart.It didn't happen immediately, so your mileage may vary.I got enough use out of it that I would not return it for being outright defective; it's just a poor and flimsy band style."
1,Buyer beware! - Watch battery corroded in six months time.,"I purchased this watch about six months ago and while on vacation last month, the watch stopped working. I assumed that the battery had died and I finally took it to have the battery replaced. The battery had corroded (Keep in mind that this is a Timex Woman's Ironman Triathlon watch. I of course wore it in the water for swimming and certainly didn't expect a corroded battery, especially after such a short time. Unfortunately, it is outside of the Timex warranty period.I had purchased this watch after another Timex Triathlon watch strap broke and the strap could not be replaced.So, now I have two useless watches from Timex that were poorly manufactured (likely in China, although the watches don't indicate where they were made). I certainly won't be purchasing another Timex sports watch."
2,Falls apart. :(,"I LOVE this watch...except that less than 10 months after purchase, the band is detaching from the face in more than one spot. The detaching band is interfering with using the watch buttons to start/stop time and change modes. I don't wear my watch for swimming, showers, baths, or any other prolonged water activities. The most water exposure it's had is when I give my kiddos baths, and it's supposed to be water resistant anyway!! I have purchased many of these watches, and this one leaves me looking for a new brand of stopwatch. As a PE teacher, I wear this watch ALL of the time...how disappointing."
4,"Great watch, but strap wears out too quickly","I love this watch. In fact, I just bought my second one. It has a 50 lap timer, countdown timer, two alarms, two time settings and a good back light feature. I have one complaint - the strap wears out and I don't think you can replace just the strap. I wear this watch all the time - even sleeping and showering so I know it takes a beating. I just wish you didn't have to replace the whole watch each time the strap wears out."
4,"Buen reloj, algo complicado de usar","El reloj es excelente, muy practico para trotar y llevar las cuentas de la vueltas. Pudiera ser mas comodo de usar, pues trae muchas funciones y los pocos botones que trae le hace algo complicado de manejar."
2,Awesome for a short time!,"I had one that lasted eight years and then I needed to replace it - understandable. I was very happy for how long it lasted. Then I had gone through four in the last three years due to the sealing on the watch. After a short time, when swimming, water seeped in and created a foggy screen making it difficult to view the time. With each replacement watch in the last three years, each one performed for a shorter amount of time than the one previous. Too bad I love the watch and it's three alarms, but I don't think I will replace my most recent watch. It's time to find a better performing watch for swimming."
2,Watch Didn't Last More than 3 Months,"I first purchased this watch May 2010. It lasted a few months. I clicked the start button while underwater and broke the water-resistant seal. I was later able to find online that this was a known problem. I purchased the watch again because I love the look and feel and how it performs when it's working. I've only had it a few months and did not use it while swimming. While running in 20 degree weather, the face started clouding over again like the seal was broken. Since then, the watch has gotten slower and slower and is still cloudy on its face. Would love the watch if I could actually get it to work more than 3 months at a time."
2,Not Very Waterproof!,"This is my second watch in two years. On my first one, the band broke after about a year. I love the look of this watch and so I bought another one. My second broke last week after about 10 months. Apparently, it is not very water resistant while swimming laps! At first, the display fogged up but dried out after a day or so. When I went swimming again, the display fogged up again and the watch quit working all together. I've had many Timex watches over the years but, am pretty disappointed in this one."
4,Timex Ironman Triathlon Watch,"Received quickly from Amazon. For a button-challenged, programming-challenged person, the way to set starts and splits is a little hard to figure out. Most of the watches that set for starts and splits are this way. It looks great, though. I wear it with dress-up clothes as well as when I'm running. Very light and comfortable."
3,"Great watch, though not great longevity","I actually just bought my second one of these watches. My other one lasted just over a year. The band became separated from the watch face in a few months, and finally, the little strap that holds the band in place finally broke so I am forced to replace the watch. Despite these issues, I am buying another one because of all the features; it has the interval setting which I use regularly in my training, and the multi-time settings allow me to easily change times when I travel through time zones. It is easy to read in the pool when I'm doing laps and great for time keeping . Nevertheless, I wish this watch had lasted longer and was of more durable construction, which is why I'm just giving it 3 stars."
5,great watch!,"the watch does everything I need it to do so I can track my intervals, know my pace, etc. Now, if it had a GPS built in, it would be perfect!!"
4,Women's Ironman watch,"Although my first Ironman watch, exactly like this, fell apart, I abused it by wearing it daily and wore it in the water. So, I was happy to purchas another one."
2,Liked it but a problem,"I loved the watch, but recently the part that hooks the band together fell off. I have reconnected it several times. However, it keeps coming a part. I guess I will see if a watch store can help me. I have only had the watch for 3 months."
2,Another watch band/face compliant,"The watch mechanism itself is great, but if I can't wear it on my wrist, it's useless. Although it looks good at first, the cheap plastic that holds the face to the strap gets worn out, stretches, and then eventually doesn't hold onto the face and buttons any longer. I wear this watch only to the gym, so I put it on and take it off 4-5 times a week, which is apparently too much stress for the watch band. Because the band is such an intricate part of the design-- the side buttons are incorporated into it-- it can't be replaced. I have to get a new watch.I've had $9.99 Casios that lasted 10 years... For $35, I think this watch should last a lot longer than the year or so I've gotten out of it. Very poor design by Timex. (Though very clever that this design flaw is not covered under the warranty.) Two stars instead of 1 because it was a 5 star item for about 6 months."
5,Good watch,"So far so good with this watch. Size is perfect, comfortable, and does everything I need it to do. Just got it so idk how long it will last."
2,Bought 6 of these exact watches. 13 months is longest any have lasted.,"Returning watch I purchased 1 month ago (water ruined display) even though supposed to be water resistant to 100 meters. In pulling up my order history by the word ""watch"" I saw that I've ordered a watch a year for the past 6 years. Most have lasted about a year, but this last one only one month. Works well until the display fails due to moisture."
2,The disposable watch- love it when it works but not durable,"I've had two ironman watches - I loved the design and ease of use, but both lasted less than a year. My advice - get it if you really like the look & the features, but don't expect it to last. Like many others' stories, the band on the first ironman broke around 10 months. My second one just got water condensation inside after 5 months. It was fine with swimming 2 or 3 times a month, then suddenly let in water and broke. Since I really like this watch, I may put up with it a 3rd time at $30-$35 on amazon. But if anyone finds a more durable, lightweight, multi-function, good looking watch - I'll be first in line to try it."
1,SHAME ON TIMEX,"This watch is advertised as a ""triathlon"" watch by Timex. It took on water the first time I took it in the pool! Timex customer service told me that you can't press the buttons when the watch is in the water!Does anyone at Timex know what a triathlon is? I'm sorry, but if you call a watch a triathlon watch it means people are going to buy it to use swimming (getting splits, etc.) and they're going to need to press the buttons while the watch is wet! False advertising by Timex. They should be ashamed!"
1,It isn't waterproof,"Despite claims, this watch is NOT waterproof. The whole reason I bought it is so I could wear it in the pool. After only a few swims it began taking on water and shorted out. I would NOT recommend this watch if you plan on getting it wet."
1,Broken band,I have had my watch for one year and the band is already cracked (the watch itself is great). The band is such that it cannot be replaced therefore the watch must be replaced. What a waste!
2,watch strap,"I love this watch and is my second one, unfortunately both watches had the strap fail on them in less that two years. I sent Timex an email and they didn't reply. I love the functions on the watch and the simple look to it so am sad about this default. I am uncertain if I will buy Timex again."
1,Waterproof? HA!,"I have worn Timex sports' watches for several years now. However, I am now considering switching to a different brand. I purchased an older model Timex Women's Ironman watch in DEC of 2007. The band kept popping off the top and bottom of the watch, forcing me to buy a new one. I went with the T59201, hoping the new band design would be better. I have had no problems with the band. It is now the watch, itself, that is the problem!I purchased the T59201 in JUL 10. After wearing it to the waterpark one day, I noticed water inside the watch. The watchface became so clouded over with condensation that the watch was useless. Timex did send me a replacement watch in about 3 weeks. I have worn this watch lap swimming twice. Today, AGAIN, I noticed water in the watch. AGAIN, the face is clouding over. AGAIN, I now have to send the watch back. Third time a charm? I don't think so. I will be asking for a different make of watch."
1,disappointment,"I purchased this watch at the same time i purchased a men's tri watch for my husband as a gift. When i tried to use my watch for the first time, the battery was dead. I contacted Amazon customer service and they refunded me teh amount for a new battery... however, it appears the battery is not the problem, as the watch has never worked for me. Disappointing, because i tried to contact Amazon customer service regarding this issue several times with no response. So i am left with a non-functioning piece of equipment. Very disappointing."
1,Not waterproof at all,"I have had 2 of these. Timex replaced the first under warranty because it took on water while swimming. The second one has done the same and Timex will not replace. They told me that if you push any of the buttons in the water or ever change the battery that the water resistance is compromised. Once it takes in water, it fries the watch and stops working. Since this in an ironman triathalon watch designed to time laps, it defeats the purpose of having the watch."
2,Not so Water Resistant,"I bought this watch and three weeks later it filled up with water when I was swimming (definitely not below 100m) and it died. Now I have to pay $8 to have it fixed and it won't come back for up to a month. A water resistant watch should be able to be used in water. And it only was submerged on maybe 5 occasions during that time frame. The customer service representative tried to tell me that I likely pushed buttons while I was underwater, but I know I didn't. Since then, I've heard other people tell me that the same has happened with their Timexes."
4,I love this Watch!,"I would have given this watch 5 stars, but the band sometimes comes loose from the strap that is designed to hold it securely in place. I lost my first Ironman Timex this way and had to buy another.I'm in Iraq right now, and I love the way it keeps my current time and the stateside time. I can easily toggle between the different time zones, and when I'm visiting the states, I just hold down the button for 5 seconds, and my secondary time, becomes my primary time.I also like the fact that I can set 3 different alarm times. It doesn't ring very loud, so I don't suggest using it to wake you up. I use it to remind me to do daily tasks.You will not be disappointed with this purchase."
5,Great watch!,I had previously reviewed my other green version of this same wathc and was disappointed because it fogged up and stopped working because I swam with it with my kids. I was hesitant to buy another one based on the reviews but I did finally go ahead and buy the black and silver version. It has been fine through swimming the gym etc. I wear it every day and it has been great. No problems.
3,Disposable Watch,"I am about to purchase my fourth ironman watch by Timex. The band separates from the face of the watch every time. Repeat: every time. While I'm peeved each time I have to buy a new one, I still do. They last about one to two years. At ~ $35 a pop, I just have to consider it a disposable watch. This watch provides me with exactly what I'm looking for: interval timing for my run/walk method of running, time, date, an alarm, a sporty look, and so light weight and comfortable that I never take it off. Literally, never. Until the band breaks -again - of course. If you can accept that you are purchasing a product with a limited life-span - it's a great watch."
1,NOT waterproof,I have now owned two of these watches. Neither was waterproof. Both leaked! One watch lasted one swim. The other watch died after three swims.
1,not water resistent,"I received the watch on a Friday, learned how to program it Friday night. Took it for a swim Saturday afternoon. By Saturday night the watch no longer worked. My swim was a simple lap pool, I might have gone 5 feet under with flip turns, and yet it cannot withstand it. Does not live up to it's water resistance as advertised"
3,Okay unless you bump it,"I just bought this watch to use as a countdown timer for sailboat racing. It is easy to use and read, but what it found out is that the location of the start/split button on the bottom of the face is far too easy to bump. It was stopped when I didn't want it to be and I had to restart it. The next time I looked at it it was stopped again. Not good when you're trying to time something. I tried four times and each time I looked at it it was stopped. I think for running it is probably fine, but for activities where it might get bumped it's no good. I am going to try to take it back and get something with a start/reset button that is more difficult to bump."
3,"Ok, not overly impressed...","I havent owned this long but I wasn't overly thrilled about it at first... its the women's size but still pretty bulky for a watch, you would have thought with technology the Timex models would be getting smaller, but its just as thick (almost half an inch) as my old Timex Expedition watch from 2001 (which died on me years ago but I just found it recently). I like the functions... hopefully I just get used to the bulk on my wrist again..."
5,CLAY'S JUSTICE is what made America a great nation.,"One doesn,t need 1,000 words to review a book that tells a magnificent story. It,s about all the things that are important in life, told in a remarkable way. It has excitement, truth, high adventure and is a delight to read. My entire family enjoyed it! What a film, someday"
3,24 cup Mini Muffin Pan,The product was difficult to handle without a tray. It cooked well and the muffins came out of the pan easily. Handling was the only difficulty I encounted.
4,Muta Rocks,"First off don't listen to the review posted by Darcey-what an ignorant statement. You obviously don't know anything about the true essence of reggae music. Your negative statement shows how pathetic and attention starved you are, and only turns an individual away from a good artist and a great album. I guess it wasn't pop enough for you. For you true reggae fans who know about good music this album is a must have. The poetic socio-political commentary accompanied by great reggae rhythms is classic. I recommend this album to any positive, intelligent reggae fan. It will make a great addition to your collection."
2,So expensive for such a useless product,"This cream doesn't even shave well, much less moisturize as you shave. After using this cream while travelling I was very disappointed. I was looking for something to fight the irritation of simple shaving cream, and provide some moisture at the same time. Not with this stuff. I'm not a prissy man, but this stuff didn't affect my breakouts after shaving or leave me feeling well shorn."
2,So so,"There are not many DVDs truly for people over 50 or 70 that are applicable to this population and not just the upper 90%. This was OK, but could have been much better. I am still looking for some that can be followed like an audio tape (good descriptions because in positions you cannot look at a DVD), are at beginner level and slow enough for this population."
2,She talks and gets interrupted way too much in this DVD...,"First of all she talks too much, then she stops all the time to correct her students. I always thought when they do any kind of exercise video, that it is practiced so they all are in sink. Instead here she is constantly stopping to talk and correct them and makes you loose your whole concentration. The exercises may be good but too many interruptions in between them. I only try this DVD twice on the third one I was so frustrated I had to turn it off."
3,The movie and the technology,"The movie was great, as expected, and the music tremendous. Had difficulty in that we could not get the full TV screen view, so it was really no better than watching it on a pc. Also, in the middle of the movie, the sound stopped coming through the TV and only came through the laptop speakers. I don't think that I would try another movie again, will just have to rent through red box or some other way of using the actual DVD."
4,Seventy six trombones!,I saw the Music Man in an older video with my friend and we both loved it. There are many great songs in it. It's also great seeing Shirley Jones pre Partridge Family. This is one of my favorite videos. The only reason that kept me from giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does seem a little bit long.
4,As Wonderful As I Remember!,"The musical was as wonderful as I remember, but the film had too much of a red hue to it. I know that trying to save these wonderful movies from the original film is not the easiest thing to do because of the way the films have started to decay, and I applaud all of the efforts that are being made to rescue every film possible. It didn't make everyone look like they were filming in hell...just that they all had bad cases of Rosacia. The quality of the soundtrack was perfect. It brought back a lot of fond memories of the first time I saw this when I was a little girl."
4,Music Man Review,"It is a great movie, but the DVD I bought had problems in it. I had to index forward and come back (fast reverse) in order not to miss too much."
3,The Music Man on VHS-Don't buy it--Buy the DVD on WS,"This musical ""The Music Man"" Starring Robert Preston, Shirley Jones, Ron Howard & others has always been one of my all time favorite musical's. I have this VHS film of this movie, which i have had for a long time. It's a Great Musical, but do yourself a favor & buy it now on DVD & make sure you get the one on Widescreen. In my opinion, it makes all the difference in the world as far as Quality goes to be able to have it on Widescreen period. This is definitely true for the Classic Epic Film's."
4,Music-filled story of a simpler time,"This movie of Meredith Wilson's ""The Music Man"" is quite a treat for the eyes and ears.This bargain-priced edition offers some extra features - the soundtrack has been remastered; there's a short documentary on the making of the movie; an intro by Shirley Jones, who plays the female lead; and a couple of theatrical trailers.This is plenty for me. I find the so-called ""audio commentaries"" (where someone is yaking while the movie is running) to be an annoyance. And I've never understood why DVDs sometimes include a radio version of the movie. I've got the movie, for heaven's sake!Anyway, if you're a curmudgeon like me and buy movie DVDs for the movie, take advantage of Amazon's great price on this one. You won't be sorry."
5,The Music Man,An all-time favorite. Great music and great talent. Shirley Jones and Robt. Preston are wonderful and Ron Howard is such a young little fellow in this movie and cute as a bug. Wonderful classic.
4,The Music Man,Robert Preston is the best Professor Hill. This is definitely a classic keeper you want in your collection
4,gifts,"I have always loved this movie and because my daughter and daughter-in-law asked for it, I ordered it for both of them. This will be for birthday presents."
5,FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT,NOW THIS IS A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE. NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING YOUR CHILD SHOULDN'T SEE. SIMPLY GREAT MUSIC AND ACTING. A MUST HAVE.
1,Arrived scratched with fingerprints!,"The disk arrived scratched with fingerprints. Very disappointing to my little girl who was waiting for the disk to arrive. I thought that by ordering a NEW, UNUSED disk from AMAZON, not a third party, that I would not have any trouble. I guess I thought wrong."
1,Will not play,This DVD has an extra security app or something and will not play on my DVD playe which is only 1 year old.
5,This DVD from Amazon can't be improved upon,"What a treat! No-one can be better than Robert Preston, Shirley Jones and little Ronnie Howard. I mistakenly purchased a remake with Matthew Broderick and Kristen Chenowich, who are fine actors/muscians and whom I love in other things, but the original cast and production are so exceptional that they can't be beat!"
4,A classic,"My daughter likes musicals (at 18 months!) so I bought this for her with fond memories of the musicals my Mom took me to while growing up. My only complaint with this video is the LONG walk down memory lane before the show itself begins. It would be better if that stuff were at the end, so we wouldn't have to wade through it to get to what we want to see."
3,Half a Music Man,Quality of video is good audio is also good . However playback halts then go's forward off and on near middle in library scene
4,Great Musical,"The Movie has always been a favorite of mine. If you have a big screen TV, this movie on DVD will appear to be sloppy in some areas, but if you just follow the story and enoy the music, you'll over come the critical nit picking of your prefectionate self. Go look in the mirror by the way.I recommend this product for purchase."
1,Disappointed Customer,"The quality of the Music Man was horrible. The picture was very graining and did not look professionally made. While the sound was still very clear I was very disappointed with my purchase, especially since I love the film the Music Man. The packaging of the product was in good quality and it was delivered timely."
5,The Wells Fargo wagon came just in time,This was for an anniversary present. My wife loves this movie.This is one of her faves in the musical business.
5,Music Man DVD,"The product came on time and in great condition. I was able to use it right away! As far as musicals go, this is a classic! I would reccommend purchasing it if you are feeling hesitant!"
4,A pleasant way to spend an evening,"This is of course a classic big Broadway musical from the era of great tunes and great stars. What makes this film particularly delightful after all of these years is the direction. It is shot in such a way as to not just ""open it up"" as a film with songs (which it does), but it gives you the feeling of the stage show with the big numbers choreographed with an eye for the proscenium stage and even a curtain call and encore at the end. You can see why Robert Preston was such a great performer (especially in this role). Comedy buffs can get a renewed appreciation of Paul Ford and Hermione Gingold. We can be charmed by Ron Howard and what a terrific actor he was at such a tender age...and marvel that there was such a creation as Shirley Jones with such beauty and such a voice....can't go wrong..."
5,I love this!,"Seeing this on DVD is sooo much better than VCR version,(Of course what isn't?) This is one of our family's favorite and I am very glad to be able to see it again. Especially with the clean look of DVD format."
5,A True Classic,"Meridith Willson's gentle musical about his native state in the early 20th century is beautifully committed to film. Robert Preston, Paul Ford, and Hermione Gingold -- scene stealers all, and what a chemistry they brought to this wonderful film. Shirley Jones as Marian, Pert Kelton reprising her Broadway role as Widow Paroo, and Ron Howard as Winthrop, all fit into their characters as though they were them.The very funny malapropisms of Paul Ford, the ""not on yer tin type, girly girl!"" of Harry Hickox, and Buddy Hackett add so much more humor to an already funny book. But my favorite has to be the ""Pick a Little, Talk a Little"" ladies. What a stitch!!While I've seen numerous stage productions, and Matthew Broderick's excellent ""Professor Hill"" on TV, Robert Preston will always be my Music Man.This is a keeper."
5,A Musical Classic,"If you love brass bands, you will be taken in by con man Professor Harold Hill (Robert Preston). Shirley Jones' early role is a charmer! We need upbeat entertainment more than ever,but do not often get it. Everyone needs this ""oldie"" in their DVD collection. Trouble in River City, but they get their 76 Trombones!"
3,O.K.,"It's a good movie, but I bought it at 6:30 on June 5, 2011 and the next day at 5:00 I wanted to resume it and it didn't work. A good movie but needs a little improvement."
2,Trouble in River City,"Meredith Wilson's ""The Music Man"" is one of those classic musicals. Its plot is simple: con man Harold Hill comes to rural Iowa, saying he'll replace the pool hall with a family-friendly marching band. In the meantime, he woos the beautiful librarian Marian. As a live musical, ""Music Man"" is exuberant and energetic. Unfortunately, as a movie it seems to go on forever.Robert Preston is stodgy as Harold Hill, and an unlikely suitor for Marian (Shirley Jones),unless she's a gold digger as well. There's a young Ron Howard, looong before his deadpan narration for ""Arrested Development"",singing ""Gary,Indiana."" ""The Music Man"" drags its feet. Too much exposition between songs. There's no energy to it. Is Iowa this boring? One hopes not.""Music Man"" is the All-American Boring Musical, unless one is fortunate enough to see a live production. Skip this movie; give Iowa a try instead!"
1,The Music Man,"I loved the movie, but hated the DVD, because it didn't work on my player! I tried 2 copies, neither one could be read. I have a Panasonic player, it reads my other 50 DVD's, but not this one. Be careful before you order this."
2,I hate this movie.,"I found this movie to be cheesey and annoying, but I know many who love it. I simply don't like any of the songs."
1,Pretty poor CD,CD worked for half the movie then nothing. Repeated attempts to play were fruitless. Nothing.
1,Renee from Florida,"The Music Man was not at all what I expected. I bought it for a family movie night, we love musicals usually. This was so boring you could barely make it through it. Actually, I made myself finish it because i spent money on it. I will be tossing it or passing it on. If anyone's interested, it's going cheap!"
4,Classic Movie,I bought this movie as a Christmas gift. I enjoyed the ease of purchasing and the price. The movie is a classic and my friend enjoyed it very much. They had specified what version they wanted since this movie had three or more different versions out and I was able to find the correct one.
5,THE FILM THAT DESTROYED ROBERT PRESTON!,"I hate a musical - with 3 or 4 exceptions. This being one of them. Con man Harold Hill (seamlessly played by Robert Preston), invades SmallTown, and makes them come alive with his promise of a ""Boys Band"". Of course the boys' parents must come apart from thier money and give it to Professor Harold Hill. Madame Librarian - who teaches piano - spots him right off, and a romantic game of cat and mouse ensues. Once exposed, the townspeople threaten him with tar and feathers. Guess who comes to the rescue. Then theres a little magic in the air. Musical highlights include TROUBLE, and 76 TROMBONES. A library dance scene reminds me of THE GREASE (starring John Travota). Oh yes.About the headline: Preston's convincing performance type-casted him for over twenty years. Destitute and alcoholc, he finally rose from the grave starring in STARSHIP TROOPERS - in which he plays a cosmic recruiter!"
5,SHIPOOPI,"The Music Man is no doubt the greatest musical of all time. Every sonG in it is great. Especially songs like ""Rock Island,"" ""Ya Got Trouble,"" and ""Shipoopi."" Robert Preston and Buddy Hackett, not to mention Shirley Jones are all excepptional in this Broadway hit. I'm 13 and I asked my aunt to buy the sound track for me for Christnas of '98, and I've been playing it over and over again since then. Every thing about this movie is good. The mayor is hilarious. Little Ronnie Howard has that nice little lispe going on there, and Buddy Hackett is awesome too. This is definately a movie you would want to buy."
5,Fantastic entertainment,"Wonderful musical comedy for the whole family. I've seen this film at least 30 times and never tire of it. The entire cast is terrific, and the production is completely top rung. Robert Preston's performance is beyond superb. Most highly recommended."
5,WHEN HOLLYWOOD GETS IT RIGHT...,"...They really get it right. Such is the case with the filmed version of ""The Music Man"". This film is simply irresistable! The music, the performances -all first rate and perfect casting throughout, the gorgeous color cinematography, the costumes, the production design. I could go on and on. If you've never seen this film or only seen it in pan and scan television broadcasts, you owe it to yourself to see this gem! Everyone agrees that Robert Preston was born to play this part. LIke Rex Harrison in ""My Fair Lady"", it is difficult to imagine anyone else in the role. Shirley Jones is absolutely stunning! She has never looked lovelier. Her voice is a miracle. I place her voice in the top five greatest female voices of all time. Wonderful film!"
4,The Music Man,This movie was a great movie. It was played through a streaming devise. Loaded without any problems. However during the time it played it had to reload several times. This occurs often with older movies and am not sure if it is the internet connection or the movie itself. Recommend this movie for a fun entertaining family movie night.
3,Great film. Poor picture quality,"This is a classic musical film and I have nothing but glowing things to say about it, however on my 50"" plasma television, the picture quality is sub par and I would love to see it remastered."
5,Great movie demonstrating the power of music to persuade,"We ordered three musicals on DVD from Amazon to give as a birthday gift. This one is a favorite. We're starting off a child in the family with an education about great American movie musicals. Who wouldn't love watching Robert Preston persuade an entire town that music can turn their world around? Charming, start to finish."
1,The Worst Action Movie,"This is one of the worst action DVD from Amazon.com I have even seen (Usually, I enjoy it). It is chaotic and there seems to be no coherent continuity between one episode to another. This is not to say that the fighting sequences are not good. With a modicum of editing, it can be made much better. In fact, if I have to evaluate the fighting sequences alone, I would have rated the DVD 5 star. This action DVD is salvagable, but, the editor is lazy."
5,Masterful - A must for both Christian & heathen alike,"I spent 9 years searching for this CD here in South Africa. One search on Amazon and now I am the proud new owner of THE best Christmas CD to grace this planet. The soul, the feeling, the harmony, the emotion - I will certainly treasure this CD for years to come.Silent Night on this CD is easily THE best song I have heard in my entire life. And I am a music fan of note. Do yourself a favour."
5,Give Love At Christmas,This is the CD that has the six minute Silent Night. Everyone who knows the Temptations and knows Motown must have this in their collection.
1,DID NOT RECEIVE,"I ORDERED THESE CD'S BUT NEVER RECEIVED THEM. I THOUGHT THEY WOULD COME AFTER THE HOLIDAYS & I WAS OK WITH THAT BUT THEY NEVER DID. I AM EXTREMELY UPSET BECAUSE OUT OF ALL OF THE CD'S THAT I ORDER, GIVE LOVE WAS THE ONE I WANTED THE MOST...VERY DISAPOINTED!"
