3,Sunset Park Latin King,It was a very revealing look of the ways of the Latin Kings.I felt it was a good read.
1,Unintelligible...,"Though I appreciate what the author was trying to achieve by writing this book, he seriously needed a copy editor. My students who are hardcore fans of the Reymundo Sanchez books were absolutely appalled by the poor grammar and spelling used in this book! As a matter of fact, many of them had a difficult time getting through the story because, as not-so-good readers, they could not get past the horrific way it was written. I just feel like a really good story got lost between misplaced commas and paragraphs that were never quite finished. I applaud the effort, but it just isn't good enough. :("
5,READING IT AGAIN!,"I just finished Reading Sunset Park Latin King. Wow, Growing up in Brooklyn Sunset Park, I can tell you that I know exactly what King Macho was going through. I am a retired gang member, 5 years in a gang called the Assasinators and to be totally honest, Brandon Cory couldn't have told the story any better. I actually feel as if I knew King Macho. Great job. I am now a gang counselor and I recommending this book to all my kids!!!!!!"
5,"yeah , That's whats up","Sunset Park Latin King, just got my copy, it's off the meat rack. Word up, it was on some real gangsta killa story. Sad how duke went through alot but it made me think of who my brothers really are. Thats some eye opener for real. Little Machos Revenge gotta be some real out of this world novel. Imma cop me that as soon as it hits the streets. 1-4-18"
1,Learn to spell before you think of writing a book.,"Why in the world would someone attempt to write a book when they have not even conquered basic elementary school English? It is very frustrating to read a book where the author can not destinguish when to use the word ""too"" instead of ""to"". Unbelievably he describes a 9mm gun as a ""Nine Mile Meter"" and uses the word ""gak"" instead of ""gat"" for gun. This amongst a million other annoying mistakes in spelling and grammar. Or should I say Speling and Gramer."
2,My least favorite of the Little Red series,"My 3-year-old really loves all of the Little Red books. She would probably give this one four or five stars, but I'm bothered by the fact that Little Red ditches her friends on Christmas Eve without so much as a by-your-leave, and by Little Blue's grumpiness. It has some imagination, but the story could use a little more editing."
5,House Party Rocks,These movies are classic and remind me of the drunken high school shenanigans we got up to. They are still so funny and a good box set.
4,House Party Collection,"The movies came in plastic wrap as if they were brand new, but 2 of the 4 dvds skipped a lot. Besides that the movies arrived quickly and I was satisfied with the other two movies and will likely conduct business with this seller in the future. Thx Happy Holidays"
1,Disappointed,I brought this off of here and the third and fourth house party wasn't in there instead it was replaced with a disk called urban legend... Im highly upset
3,not yet,"i bought this dvd, the bank already charge my purchase, i pay for it but i haven't received it yet, so i think i'll review it when i get my dvd, i'm still waiting"
5,Great movie,Love these movies. We love watching old movies. Kid & Play knows how to keep us laughing. These 4 movies are classic.
3,Old School,"Nothing better than watching old school movies on new age technology : ) For those of you who like Kid N Play, this is a nice find with all 4 movies in one."
4,House Party Collection,"First 3 videos were just as I remembered them from back in the day, Hilarious. The 4th movie was not the same and lame."
1,This Game is so Dumb I threw it against the wall,I hate this game. Even though its not out yet I have already played it cause im form the future and it stinks dont buy. The future rocks
5,A Little bit harder,"This is Volume 3 and I am on Volume 2. It looks interesting, and a bit harder.But that is the way you advance playing the violin."
4,Might want to think twice,I got this game for my 10 year old daughter who is a HUGE Bratz fan. She hates this game and has only played it maybe a dozen times. Usually after 15 minutes or so she is totally frustrated with it. You might want to consider trying to find this somewhere to rent before you buy it.
1,Bratz Game,i ordered 3 of these maybe by the year 2020 his game might be worth $3.00 or i even doubt that you guy are right about one thing IT DID SUCK ASS BIG TIME why did i order 3 of these who knows but i only bought all 3 of them for $5.00
4,excellent summary of the arts through the ages,"this book was interesting because it traces all aspects of the arts (including painting, literature and philosophy) since ancient times. also the grouping of all the aspects of art of a particular time make it easier to trace their influences on each other. what is also interesting is that an excerpt from an influential book of that time is included in each chapter."
3,As The Mystery Unfolds,"I first became aware of this book three years ago as a first -year teacher. It was at this time that I went to the school's library to find a book to read with small groups. I found Looking for Red written by Angela Johnson. Overall, I found it to be a very realistic view of guilt and grief and how a young girl and her friends deal with it. I did notice however, that may of the students had a difficult time following the main character's thoughts and actions as they switch from present to past, yet we forged ahead and finished the book. I really liked Ms. Johnson's style of writing and would recommend her books for Middle School students to read."
4,The Skinny on a Good Read,"I've read a bunch of Satterthwait's books -- he's one of those authors you discover and then keep seeking out. His writing is always sly, witty, and solidly suspenseful. ""Perfection"" is no different. The sociological/psychological implications of this premise about a serial killer who slices up fat girls and trims them to fit his obscene ideal are disturbing but riveting. You won't be able to put ""Perfection"" down -- and if you're on a diet, you'll want to read it with your back to a wall."
5,Love it!,"I simply love what it does for my hair and the scent is simply just so wonderful! love, love it!liz"
1,Boy does it STINK!!,"I'm not sure how this stuff is getting such great reviews because the lotion is only passable--there are plenty of other cheaper and better ones. But even my hubby commented on it the smell of my hair (and not in a good way) and he never mentions that at all. I couldn't get past the smell. It bothered me enough to I quit using after the 3rd application. It (literally) gave me a headache. (Right now I'm trying to palm this product off on a friend, but no one will take it for the same reason I don't like it--the smell is truly atrocious!!)"
1,Bad batch of conditioner,This product was diluted and did not work like my last container of this which I got from another resource! I am sure it was tampered with!
4,Far better than stock - too noisy for your DD,Just as the other reviewer I put these on just prior to a track day. Car is a 2011 STI sedan running stage 2. Performance is much better than the stock pads. Front rotors were upgraded at the same time and also added ATE super blue. No fade at all - the STI is slightly lighter than the Boss and of course makes less power so the pads might be a better match for smaller cars. Exactly as the other reviewer experienced there is a loud squeal at low speeds now. I bedded the pads well so it is likely a symptom of the pads. I am willing to tolerate the noise for the vastly improved braking - I don't drive the car to work everyday. The Hawk HP+ pads are a decent compromise if you don't have the time and/or money for a separate track set up. These are overkill and too noisy for street only use.
3,Just for Kids,"I felt the story was pretty mundane and written for the 10 to 14 yr old audience. The pictures were mostly all drawings. The story was rather repetitious memories of people who actually lived and recorded their memories of the storm......but how much can you say about a snow storm that isn't repeated over and over again. Young people might find the book interesting, but I thought it was pretty dry. My 15 year old thought it was just OK."
4,This Collection Does Macross Justice,I was a big fan of the Robotech series when I was growing up. There were always plot points that I found confusing that didn't quite fit in. That was because as I found out later the Robotech series were patched together from 3 seperate TV shows. I enjoyed watching this show as it was originally intended. The extras are amazing with a lot of cast interviews and concert footage and factoids. The only reason I am not giving this collection 5 stars is that I prefer the music from the Robotech series. I tried but I am just not a fan of Japanese pop music.I would recommend this collection to anyone who was a fan of the Robotech TV series.
5,A Big Help,"The book was in mint condition since it was brand new. Also, it helped me pass the registry exam. The review questions helped me find what I still needed to review, and they seemed more difficult than the registry exam questions. So I felt the book made me feel like the registry was a breeze."
2,Buy it for the CD-ROM.,"I just took the registry exam in April of 2004. Honestly, I didn't use this book all that much. There are so many typos that it is hard to read and some of them change the meaning of the questions. Some of the questions contradict each other. Some say to use gonadal shielding on all exams on all patients - even pelvis routines. Others will say the right answer is to only use it when the gonads are within a certain distance from the primary beam or when shielding won't interfere with imaging the pertinent anatomy. That makes it difficult to study. I did use the CD-ROM that was included. It helped me to know how I would do on the actual exam. For instance, it helped me to know that I needed to slow down and read the whole question."
3,"book is good, software is TERRIBLE","The book is good and has been a helpful review, however the software that accompanies the book is just terrible!! It provides questions in a test like format and when you answer a question correctly it tells you that you are wrong and then explains how that answer that was marked wrong is actually the right answer. Very frustrating! I give up!"
4,Wonderful ballads.,This superb CD remains a lost gem of the legendary Stylistics' back catalog. The group's commitment to the art of the Soul ballad is commendable and their music remains timeless--regardless of whatever label they are signed to. Classic Soul...1990s style!
2,Image shows more items than what comes with the item.,"The image shows that this items includes more than 1 unit included for the price. Upon delivery today, I found there was only 1 item in the package. Doesn't work out well for the party favors I need for this weekend. Rereading the description, it is not clear how many items should ship with it. But overall, the image does not represent the number of items you will get."
2,never pay attention to the picture,"I won't know exactly if the toy itself is fun until after Christmas but I do know I didn't pay enough attention to the description of the product, for some reason I thought I was getting more than one container of the mud and I think the price was steep for what it is. I do not fault the seller only myself"
4,My kid loves it... fun for adults too,Good old slime that comes in different colors. I had a problem with my initial order. Both Amazon and the seller quickly fixed the issue and made it right for which I was very thankful. I also as an adult find it rather therapeutic just squeezing it with my hand. LOL!
1,false advertising/lack of warning,Lack of warning on the bottle that this product can damage the leather. This product can ruin your leather and the only warranty on the bottle of for the refund of the product. So they know it can damage leather.
1,Not a good product,I used it on my mustang leather seats and wound up with spots a couple of days later. Don't know why this happened. I don't know why it took a couple of days for the spots to come up. I would not recommend. I'm trying to contact customer service and see how to remove those spots.
4,Excellent source of logo ideas for graphic artists,"David Carter's, The Big Book of Logos, is just a huge collection of excellent logos from all sorts of different businesses and organizations. It's a good place to look to find out what other artists are doing, and a good source of inspiration when your own ideas seem to have dried up. Good book!"
5,Great inspiration!,"I have yet to own this awesome book but from looking at it in my graphics portfolio class today, I have all sorts of logo ideas stirring in my brain now. There are so many amazing logos and trademarks in this big book that it is sure to spark a creative mind and get the juices flowing."
4,Great book despite poor editing,"This is a great inspirational book for logo designers! I find it to be a valuable addition to my design library. The only criticism I have is that this book was not carefully edited. There are low-resolution logos peppered throughout and logo placement does not always match logo descriptions. If you can get past this small speed bump, you have an excellent book."
1,the worst design book i have ever spent $ on,"Fellow buyers of design books on amazon this is the worst book i have ever purchsed . This book is a compilation of the most poorly designed trademarks. Please do not get this book!!! All the logos seem to have been haphazardly picked. If you insist on getting this book, you should definately check it out at a book store first because that will change your mind faster than roaches scurrying away from light."
1,Wtf City Racer,"First, this game should have costomisable cars. All you do is change the color.Second, the cars handle like a bar of soap.You turn and go the opposite way.Third, WTF ARE THE STUPID POWER-UPS FOR!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY IT WASTES YOUR MONEY."
3,six days,"the book is a tremendous step by step review, first of the development of the IDF and then the actual war. However, discussion of the Egyptian side and viwepoint and world reaction is superficial at best. Also, maps are imperative to follow the course of events. The maps in the Kindle version are unreadable. This is one book that should be read in paper"
2,Awkward Israeli OohRa tilt,"I will keep this short. The only necessary chapter to read is on the Zahal. the IDF. Much of the book depends on silly, childish praise for the realistically superior Israeli Force. So much so that it makes for pedantic reading. I do not recommend."
3,An Education,"Although Mr. Wilson's Cabnet of Wonders is at first slightly confussing and plotless, much like the type of museum disscussed in the book, it is eventually leaves you with a sense of...well...wonder. The book is construsted to take you through the wonders of a ""wonder cabnet."" I found it to be an education on what it mean to learn, that wonder is a nessisary component."
2,"Maybe it's just me, but...","I really, really hated this book. I had to read it for an art class (I'm a biochemistry major), but if you are reading for fun... be forewarned that a good half of the museum isn't factual, but that you can't tell which half. I still can't tell, and I've read the blasted thing three times trying to figure it out.Also, I have my doubts about the author, who doesn't seem to know some basic facts about bats, for crying out loud. To be fair, his writing style is pleasant, intriguing, and believable. It's just that I hate his subject matter and the way he went about his little essay thing."
4,rainbow ribbon dancer,my daughter absolutly loves this toy it is her favorite thing to play with she is always standing on crates and boxes on stage giving shows:)
4,Kids like it,"Kids love playing with it, but it needs the ends reinforced with fray check and double over stitching or else it frays."
3,For the dance team,"My church ""Cristo la Roca"" got these for our girls. They seem to like them but then again they use them for choreography for our dance team, so they have no choice, lol. But as their trainer I love how they look, but they are very fragile. They don't look like they will last too long, but I will update in 6 mos I guess."
4,Hours of Fun While Burning Energy!,"I purchased this for my granddaughters, 5 years old, for Christmas. By the looks of everything they appear to be of good quality and durable."
4,3 yr old loves it,"I bought this for my 3yr old daughter when I bought her the Dora movie,"" Fantastic Gymnastics"". Dora and my daughter run all over the house with this ribbon. She's had it for 2 months and hasn't broken it yet, so it must be somewhat durable!! Lol"
3,Pretty much what you expect,"It was what I expected. Plastic stick, durable ribbon. It costs all of 25 cents to create, so a bit expensive."
2,Disappointing,Very cheap quality. Won't last long. Expected more for the price. Shipping was fast. My granddaughter liked it. Will go with a real professional one next time.
3,Not Bobby's Best,"Bobby Osborne may well be the greatest Bluegrass musician of all time. His worst is still good but this album doesn't showcase his many talents as well as some of his other albums like ""Where I Come From""."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This you call ''DARTH VADER TREANSFOMATION''of lego suck likecrap!! I recommend buying somthing thing else than this C-R-A-P. Here are the good things about this lego set it has Anakin and Darth Vader but darth vader darth vader didnt come with a lightsaber!! How stupid is that? I mean it has no moving featres [except the spinnig transform thingy] but besdse that it it just down right S-T-U-P-I-D!! Bye now
4,Wacky and fun,"I've played Rayman2 and loved so I just couldn't help getting the third installment. Raymans adventure begins when a red lum scared to death by something turns into crazed blacklums, the blacklum multiplies until only blacklums are left in the core of the world. After a couple of levels Globox swallows Andre, king of blacklums and those hoodlums won't give globox any peace until Andre comes out, meanwhile you as Rayman need to beat wacked-out levels to get to doctors and free globox of his pesky blacklum. Thats all really, just one level I need to warn you about, the desert of Knaaren, those guys are creepy! First they capture globox then they chase you, not to mention they're invinsible AND say weird stuff like ""brains"" and ""tastes better salted"" they are the real meaning of depressing. Now go buy it!!!!!"
5,TO MAKE YOU FEEL MORE MADDER!!,This game is off the HOOOOOOOK!!! Buy it it's funny. NEW POWERS AND ABILLITEIs. Battle feirce creatures. BUY IT. You won't be dissapointed.
4,A lot of fun,its a very fun game almost matching up to dreamcasts rayman 2.It has lots of new powers like cool suits and cool bad guys and a different battle system which is cool. The graphics are cartoony but good and the music is cool and the voice of john liguazamo are sometimes really funny. Its pretty much a wacky fun game for any age so have fun.
5,Never outgrow this,My SIL used this to announce costumes at her child's Halloween party so we got some for ourselves. We have 3 so the kids don't have to share. It is endless fun for putting on shows and introducing skits. We love it and never get tired of it. Bonus - no batteries required!
1,Like a plastic cup,This item is like plastic cup. It shouldnt even be considered a toy. Terribly dissapointed. Item should not even be sold on Amazon
4,Kids think it's a blast!,"I ordered two for Christmas, one for each of my children (3.5 yrs and 5 yrs). They use it along with a keyboard (one sings and the other plays), and they really enjoy it. Super low-tech fun!"
4,magic mix,The kids love this mic. IT has a great echo and projects just enough. This has lasted and made more kids smile at our house then other more expensive mics with batteries. This is a great birthday party goody!
3,Not Loud Like The Old Ones,"I bought an echo mic about ten years ago as part of my annual search for annoyingly loud toys to send home with kids at Christmas. With a new set of kids to buy for, I could recycle the gift idea. These do sort of echo, but they are in no way as impressive as the old ones were. Kids don't know the difference, but it's somewhat disappointing. Don't expect too much."
4,Awesome,"I bought two of these for my nieces for Christmas. They ran around the house singing carols, dropping them pulling on the parts and enjoyed everything about them. Great for kids who love to sing, make noise or just be silly."
4,good prop,The hard plastic variety like this seems to work better than the softer ones available. The echo is nice and the colors are fun. It would be nice if the label came off more easily. I ordered 10 for use with a fairly large choir and it took both chemical removers and a lot of time to get them cleaned up.
3,"Fun toy, little big for small hands","This mic works well, but it's quite large, so it fits an adult's hand much better than a child's. It's fun for our daughter to play with it, but at 2 years, she has to use both hand to hold it"
2,boring,The mike is a lot bigger than I expected & I don't hear much of an echo. My daughter doesn't care for this toy.
4,Fun!,I purchased this toy so that when my son watches Sid the Science Kid he could have a Mic too! We have tons of fun with it. They do sell this product in the dollar store wish would have saved me time and a couple dollars. But other than that we loved it !
2,boring...,i ordered the mic knowing it would not have battery and would have limited sound power... but it is worse than i thought.. only when you shout enough it creates a bit of an echo.. my 4 yr old got bored of it quickly.. it is as good as a piece of plastic shaped like a mic at $5..
4,Great Fun,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It is so cool.....it's like a little science experiment (talk in the mike, sound hits spring, spring vibrates, and you hear your voice echo)...my daughter LOVES IT. It is such a great inexpensive toy. Will recommend this to kids of all ages."
3,Okay mike - purchase elsewhere,"This mike is okay as long as your child is not looking for great magnification. It works by vibrating a spring inside the ""mike."" If purchased at a discount / big box store, it would be worth the money - since purchasing the toy here I've since seen it elsewhere for anywhere between $1.50 and $3.00."
3,Average item,This works OK but not great. You have to yell into it to hear the reverb. I had hoped for a little more volume.
2,Broken upon receipt,"I knew what to expect when buying this thing, because I had one when I was younger. It's not a microphone but more of an echo chamber. It can be fun to play with for a minute or two at a time. Mine was broken, though, when I received it and it was not worth the effort to return it, so I would suggest not buying this online but rather in a store - you also get to pick the color you want that way."
2,Oridinary,"Pretty much nothing. Very little echo quality. Would not recommend. Tem more words required.six, five, four, three, two, one. none."
2,Could not pick the color,Vendor does not let you pick the color and I ended up receiving a pink and purple mic for my son.
2,Very disapointed,"I was very excited to order this for my son, I had one as a kid and loved it. It says colors may vary, but I didn't expect to get a hot pink and purple one for my 2 yr old boy. I didn't mind if it was blue, or orange, or yellow, or green, or red like all the pictures show- but really? why make something SO gender specific without letting you pick. Then to top it off it doesn't work very well. It hardly echos, definitely regret making this purchase."
3,Magic Mic,"My daughter wanted a microphone very badly, so my mom bought her this one. Within the day my three year old daughter broke the cord off of the bottom. Within 4 months I started noticing that she was putting all sorts of things inside of it, this distorted the sound. It's been about 7 months since she got it and I just had to throw it away because it was about to break into sharp plastic shards... My daughter seemed to love it, I kind of liked it, and her friends always thought it was a lot of fun. However, it didn't last long and became a big issue in our home."
3,Okay,"Purchased this for 3-1/2 year old. He tried it and set it aside and that was that. Not a hit, for this child.It takes a few tries to get the voice to amplify and sound interesting. I'm hoping that maybe it will be more interesting, once the little guy figures it out."
4,Found it!,"A wooden ice bucket is and was hard to find, until I finally found this beauty on Amazon. It really sets off my solid oak bar. Remember, when in doubt about where to find something go to Amazon. Thanks Amazon!MT"
3,Not completely as advertised,"So this 4 pack says that all the DVD's are widescreen. They come 2 movies per disc.One disc was fullscreen ONLY, and the other was widescreen. Not too big of a deal but I probably would not have purchased it if I knew only one disc was widescreen."
4,4 Films in 1,"Great buy, 4 movies in 1 Package. Came brand new in DVD box with plastic wrap still on it. Works great"
4,great combination,"Love Austin powers, but I had never heard of Spies Like Us, but it turned out that I really enjoyed the movie. The video quality seems kind of low for a DVD though."
3,Shag Me Babbbbby.,If you can handle Mike Myers this is a collection that should satisfy you. All four of his spoof on International Movies stretched as far as one can. Not the only movies he has done but a nice collection of some of his zany stuff. Since there is no editing (as they do on TV) some may find the in parts a bit strong though it isn't as gutter language as it could have been. Just for fun and an off beat comic relief a good collection for your library of DVDs.
1,Unhappy,Only got 2 movies instead of 4. No replacement. Sucks don't buy gere they will rip you off. Very unhappy.
3,mike,These movies were rated as like new butr they were not even near that. 2 of the 4 disks would skip half way through the movie and did not appreciate that.
2,"Replace ""Spies"" With A Fourth Mike Myers Comedy Please","They should've put The Love Guru as the fourth film because it's a another zany Mike Myers character movie which fits better with this set and call it the Mike Myers Collection. Besides, Spies Like Us is already included in another set.WB probably figures they can still make a profit off their less favorable movies (box office bombs)by including them in a ""4 for the price of one"" collection. International Spies Collection falls under the category of a great trilogy set with a fourth less stellar flick (see Chris Tucker, Ice Cube sets). Some collection choices (Batman, Superman, Final Destination, Nightmare etc) are actually great because each movies in the series is collected and that's a major reason why we consumers take interest."
5,pleased,The book was exactly what they said it would be. It. Shipped quickly. It fit the purposes I needed it for.
4,The Cloning,"Very enlightening and educational as well as entertaining. If you're one of those people who have trouble with moral issues and knowing where the line should be drawn, this book is for you. Reading this book caused me to do some serious thinking and soul searching. Science may be able to recreate a human being, but they can't breath the breath of life into it. That is God's job. Jan, we need a sequel and it needs to show the clone with the God hole. You did a great job. Keep writing."
5,A very good kids movie.,This is a good movie that I think young kids will enjoy.I thought it was a very good show.
4,Archie meets a cat,"Archie says ""hi"" to a cat, then it follows him around. Archie and Peter then put on a street show, and the cat jumps inside Archie's paper bag costume, and the show is over! The cat ruined the performance!This is another solid book from Ezra Jack Keats. Archie is also a character in his _Whistle for Willie_, and several others. Peter is the same character from _Whistle for Willie_, _Peter's Chair_, and _A Letter to Amy_.Archie shows how to make the best of a bad situation, and the characters show cleverness and ingenuity. The sense of playful spontaneity is probably better conveyed here than in Keats' other books. Highly recommended.Ken32"
3,A lesson in marketing,"Although ""Hi, Cat!"" predated Hello Kitty by 4 years, the story's title character failed to develop into an international franchise."
2,Pretty bad,"I loved the first three tony hawk games, and having gone a while without playing on, I gave this a shot. Several times in the game the objective/goal had unclear instructions which led to a lot of frustration trying to complete simple tasks. I play a lot of games -- I can follow directions -- but these were really bad. Also, the voice acting/cut scenes are badly done and annoying. The whole ""what type of skater are you"" thing is a cheap gimmick, and I beat all three career paths simultaneously. The video editor is not well thought out and is a pain to use. I returned this game and got EA SKATE which is what THPS was so many years ago -- an original, fun skating game."
2,dumb game,seems like they are just overdoing these games. they should have just stuck with the basics of the classic ones and improved the graphics.
4,"Very good, but a little Tough","The game itself is not tough, it is actually very easy to learn, but the controls on certain moves are near impossible. Its fun to create your player and make it through to the ranks and to the top. For under [...] bucks I declare this game a must for anyone who loves the Tony Hawk games, or just wants a cheaper version of the newer games."
4,pretty cool,"its the coolest tony hawk yet because of the area and how big it is and that there are a whole bunch of new trick and things you get to do, like customize your own longe into a skate park"
1,Biggest Dissapointment,"I just bought this game because I haven't plain any TH games since Underground due to the repetitive feel and how pathetic the graphics had been getting. I recently got a PS3 tho, and figured what the hell...this is next generation gaming is it not? obviously not..this game just sucks...the biggest flaw is the the graphics...I have a 52 inch 1080i Samsung LCD, and the graphics still look horrible...it reminds me of somthing that came straight off of the PS2. Not only that the levels are completely boring, the controls aren't anywhere near the same to the TH games that were actually tight..honestly everyone should avoid this game at all costs...This game makes THUG for ps2 look like the upgrade version..and Im not exaggerating. Spend your money on a game thats worth it, dont WASTE your money on a lame venture to further fatten the pockets of the idiots that keep making TH game after another after another...you get the picture.JR TRAP"
2,very disappointed...,"why couldn't they make the game to where you could just go straight to skating competitions in front of screaming fans & earning big bucks. here's something else: retro decks IN THE FISHTALE SHAPE not the bannana board, man i hate the bannana board. I've been palying the hawk series games since PS1, & i'm ticked that this game sucks sooo bad. they didn't even think of the folks like myself who've been playin this game since the beginning, we don't wanna have to spend hours having to reaccomplish all the tricks again, mindless repitition, it's boring. there should be a seperate section on the game for beginners. i dunno, but they could've done a much better job. heck i couldn't even get the cheat codes on the game sites to work. i'm selling this game...."
3,Not much pop for not much cash,"I purchased these at CompUSA to help block the ambient noise during frequent air travel over the past year. The noise-cancelling feature works surprisingly well, but the overall sound quality is inferior to several other brands of non noise-cancelling headphones I've had in the past. They are especially poor at handling solid, deep bass riffs; after a couple of sessions a buzz developed in the low frequency range, even though the headphones had never been used with anything but a laptop computer. If you're looking for something that will blank ambient noise well and you're not too picky about sound quality, these are probably worth the $$s. If sound quality is a major concern, you'll be unhappy with this product."
3,"As of 2003,Laserlight is the best DVD, Keep your Laserdiscs!","IF you don't own a Laserdisc player, buy this Laserlight DVD. If you do own one look for the Laserdiscs!""SABOTAGE"": The Criterion Laserdisc is sharper and smoother with clearer sound than this DVD.""THE LODGER"": There is a Japanese Laserdisc that is much sharper and less choppier than this DVD.Even better, watch the 35mm restoration of ""THE LODGER"" on the AMC cable network, complete with color tints. Why this version has not appeared on DVD yet is a puzzle to me."
3,Terrorism affects everyone,Hitchcock's Sabotage is an important film for our times as well as the late 1930's in which it premiered. A group of Nazi terrorists are working within England in the days immediately preceeding WWII. One of these is the small cinema owner Verloc whose involvement at the beginning of the film is limited to the nonviolent shutdown of a power station. Later he is tasked with delivering a bomb to Picadilly Circus. This plot goes terribly wrong and a family member is killed.The disc I viewed is by Laserlight and was not terribly good. The image and sound quality were poor but this was to be expected from such a low priced offering. The upside is that one gets to view an early film by Hitchcock that is not well known and generally available. It would be great if a better transfer were made available for some of these earlier works but this one is well worth checking out.
5,Great product!,"I have read that the form of calcium in this supplement is more easily absorbed by your body than other forms of calcium. Add that to the Vitamin D and a few other minerals and you create the best supplement for easiest calcium absorption, and no gas! This product has what I believe to be the best combination for post-menopausal women. I take it twice a day and exercise regularly."
5,"There's no school like the old school - no halters, bridles or gimmicks!","I met Mr. Lyons many years ago when I was a young girl. Watching his Symposium, I was able to help several friends with their hard to catch horses. Even in these days with all of the Johnny Come Lately ""Natural"" horsemen, I still find myself falling back to using Round Pen Reasoning with almost every horse I work with. It is old school and it works!! No halters, no 'sticks' no gimmick tools to buy. Just a lariat and a round pen and your patience!"
4,"Murder, romance and family connections","A competently written formula mystery, this author showes an excelent grasp of skills needed to interweave complex family and emotional ties into the story. Lark is a book store owner who is invited to a wealthy old man's mountain estate because of her mother's status as a poet. Her boyfriend comes too. Natually, there are some murders, which Lark sort of/somehow gets involved in solving. This story surprised me with the twists of the plot, always logical but unexpected. The ""lark"" series reminds me of Charlotte McCleod's Max and Sarah Bittersjohn stories but with a more brooding flavor."
2,Titans women's watch (pink),"I was disappointed with this watch. I doubt I would have bought it IF I had seen it first. The major thing I disliked was that the numbers on the watch face are ""white"" with no contrast color on the edge. This makes them really hard to read and is bad enough that you would almost have to go by the hand position to read. Although the the package holding the watch says the watch is ""glow in the dark"", the numbers did not glow--only the hands seem to glow. Also, the chrome around the watch face is dull--not at all shiny."
4,American Government-Textbook,"Very well written, with good concrete historical examples to illustrate concepts in American Government. Book is based on five core principles-though this is a little simplistic. Still, it reads more like a monograph and less like a textbook."
2,"it is just ""ok""",not worth the $5 i paid . . .should have been more like $2 item . . . looking for different one
1,Save your money!,"Don't waste your money on the Magic Mic Jr. Get the regular size as that one is great. The Jr doesn't have the holes around the top of the mike so there is no echo whatsover. The regular Magic Mic is great, your voice really echos and my grandson loves it, I even have fun singing into it, that's why I bought 4 of the Jr thinking it was the same only a little smaller, WRONG!!! I couldn't figure out why there was no echo until I compared them and noticed the openings around the top were not on the Jr, making it useless and not much fun. The picture shown is the regular Mic, not the Jr."
2,Cheap!,This a just a piece of junk. Not very well made at all. The sound is very poor- don;t waste your money.
3,Interesting...not great,"These are simply ""props"" that can be used to pretend that you are singing to an audience, which is very entertaining for young children. You must get your mouth right on the ""microphone"" cover to get the effect of a slight echo. If you have two or more children, it would be good to get more than one and perhaps in different colors to separate them just from a hygienic perspective."
5,Young Kids Love Them,Bought these as stocking stuffers for 3 & 4 yr old grandkids. They were exactly as described and they've had great fun singing concerts and announcing sports with them.
4,Must See,The production quality and stylistic elements of this DVD are unusual to say the least. But it tells a great story and presents factual information about a subject most people know very little about. See it and pass it on.
1,The black one is suede not leather.,It fits smaller than other Nine West shoes.After 2 days use the suede broke near the tootsies. Not recommended.
4,nice and elegant,"heels are really high but they're very comfortable... you wont slip with these shoes.. and they look very nice with pants, jeans or work clothes. Size was perfect."
5,A year later I am still using this book as a reference,"First, I should say that I was a student of Dr. Brown's and took his class in which we used this book as the text. But, I still find the information contained in this book useful even now that I am no longer a student. I found this area of psychology very applicable to my daily life, and I am surprised that this is the only book on self-psychology available on the market. He writes in a clear, entertaining manner and he makes the concepts easy to understand. This is a valuable reference to me, and I am certain it will continue to be as I enter graduate study in psychology."
1,I wish I had ALSO seen the previous reviews before buying this junk.,"I'm wondering how this product got out the door! Worse, it's still being sold. I wanted to move to a USB TV Tuner from my Hauppauge PVR 150 so I could use it on my laptop as well. The picture quality is horrible. There was a ""banding"" area on the left side of the screen that was even there when I completely disconnected the cable; the snow on the screen was even screwed up.If you are considering buying this product despite reading this review, then you will be next in line to get burned. This is junk is being returned tomorrow!"
1,Not worth the try.,I should have listen from the other review before buying this junk. It only works with XP but the result is not good and the quality is grainy. The tuner doesn't work either. I installed to Vista and it messed up my DVD-ROM. I'm returning this product and find a better one.
1,Don't buy,"I bought this. Big mistake. First, it doesn't have all the necessary equipment to work with. Second, the software completely corrupted my computer and destroyed my video and sound card, as well as my DVD drive.I do not recommend this product to anyone."
4,"If you like Moravia, you'll like it","Good novel. You must like Moravia, and you should not mind about happy ends. I enjoyed it, and I will remember it, so I'm doubting between 4 or 5 stars."
5,"A wonderful, tragic family saga evoking all human emotions","The Camerons was so real the reader could enjoy the story with all five senses. I'd pay nearly anything for a copy. The author, I believe, was one Robert or Michael Crichton."
5,"Great behind the scenes info, interviews and photos",Great DVD. There was a lot of information given about the support operations (behind the scenes stuff) that you typically don't see. There's even a tour of the Presidential quarters by President Bush himself. This is a must DVD for anyone who is an Air Force One fan or anyone who is interested in military operations.
4,Secret Access: Air Force One,"An excellent overview of the President's plane and of the staff who maintain same. The staff are all very dedicated to their jobs and to keeping our president safe and comfortable. I admire the Air Force men who want to be a part of the staff, enough so that they spend two years just on polishing detail. This program should be shown in schools."
1,The Word Awful Doesn't Even Begin To Describe It....,"We really needed some storage fast. Hurricane Sandy crushed our garage - we have to demo it. Thought this 8 X 8 would fit my mower, blower, yada yada. It came with the wrong instructions, for a start. The box had been taped and retaped a dozen times (or so it looked like) so I'm guessing I'm not the first to return it. I'm mechanical, so using the incorrect instructions, I could see how it was SUPPOSED to go together. The support tubes LOOK strong enough, but you are building an arch with them above your head, and they don't 'fit' together and hold. As soon as you take your hand away, the whole thing comes crashing down before you can tie the silly support 'string'. It's made in China - send it back there, Amazon, let them figure it out...."
3,instructions,Once I figured out how to assemble this it went up easy. The directions were writen by someone who has a nephew who has English as a second language. Go to the website (where the pictures aren't any better) where they have at least the length of each piece. The directions are for a 4x8 shelter and parts are not the same as an 8x8. I will see how it weathers the first winter in MN.
1,Ridiculous amount of bugs,"This game could be a 5 star, if it worked properly. I've only had the game one month and I've found several bugs in it. I'm a computer programmer and if my work had this many errors in it, I'd be out of a job.If you win a match within the time limit in 'Rated Game', half the time it'll declare your victory a 'Stalemate'. This has happened probably a dozen times.Also, it sometimes overwrites your save files. I had a profile with a 4-0 record and this morning it was overwritten. I recreated it, won a game and saved it. Thanks to another 'stalemate' that I didn't deserve, I rebooted after a 2nd game. I come back and my new profile with 1 victory saved has been overwritten again.If you love chess, try to get this game used at GameStop or some other used game store. But be warned. It has more bugs in it than Windows 2000."
3,chess game,Chessmaster is a good fun game but the screen is sometimes hard to see. This makes learning moves difficult at times. Overall it is a pretty average game.
4,The Vistor,"I really enjoyed this movie, it also tought me a great deal about how people are treated. My heart went out to the young man, the way they destroyed his life and broke his spirit. Shame on us. We need to have better control and more compassion for the every day people, not everyone is against the USA"
5,Loved it,The dvd was in pristine condition and arrived much faster than I had expected. I am very impressed with this seller.
4,Performance of a lifetime from Richard Jenkins!,"Wonderful little film that provides Richard Jenkins with the role of a lifetime! His minimalist acting reminds of Bill Murray's latest work, except Murray uses his abilities for comedic ends, while Jenkins broadcasts sadness and loneliness. All the supporting actors are also very strong, making this one of the best movies of the year."
3,drum therapy,"In the first scene of this movie, a fifty-something widower named Walter quits his fifth piano teacher and sells his piano. His buttoned-up and boring life as an economics professor in Connecticut has flat-lined emotionally. In the final scene, Walter's grooving on an African drum in the underground of the New York City subway. Formulaic, far-fetched, even predictable? You'll have to decide, but many critics have loved this film. When Walter is forced to present a paper in NYC, he returns to an apartment he owns there, only to discover two squatters from Senegal and Syria. But they are more than mere squatters for several important reasons, and how their stories intersect form the plot of this movie and the reason why Walter found authenticity in his life after admitting that for so very long he had ""only been pretending."""
1,Total PC Garbage,Awful movie. I couldn't finish watching it. This is a propaganda movie to promote ILLEGAL IMIGRATION. Don't waste your money.
2,Overrated,"Being a fan of Tom McCarthy's directorial debut,The Station Agent, I had high hopes for this movie. I was sadly disappointed. When the main character's major problem is boredom, you know you're in for a boring movie. At times it was like watching an after school special."
3,"Interesting, yet predictable and a bit preachy","Spoilers ahead:This story is interesting enough, with a bored professor latching on to a young foreign couple from Senegal and Syria, respectively, who have taken to living in his old apartment. He tries his best to help them when one is detained for no good reason except that his mother threw out a notice about deportation that had been sent to them years earlier, and he never saw it. Also, the couple is in the US illegally.It is all very predictable, with one person being sent back home and the prof trying to make the detention center officers feel guilty--to no avail-and then he takes up drumming in the subway as a tribute to his missing pal.Also, there are several shots of the Statue of Liberty, the flag, and so on, which are clearly meant to get in our faces about injustice in the face of a free country. We didn't really need these, though; any injustices should already be obvious."
1,Another movie from the politically correct propaganda machine,"Another movie that attempts to tell Americans they owe illegal immigrants a free pass...well you know why ..because Americans are all bored and boring and own too much and have too much money and don't really produce anything original,don't even know their geography."
5,Beautiful,"The Visitor is a stirring film that explores middle aged loneliness and isolation after a spouse's death, and the injustice and callousness of the American system. Memorable and worthwhile!"
4,Quiet movie about a quiet lonely man,"I had avoided this movie as it sounded boring. Though it has very deliberate pacing, it is not boring. It is all held together by Mr. Jenkins well deserved Oscar nominated roll. This movie teaches us much about passion and connecting to others. It also deals heavily in the risks that are involved in opening up to others and, always, how that risk can have a downside. I am writing this without notes in front of me but I must add that the young man in this movie that plays the ""drum"" is also most exceptional and conveys such charisma. But virtually every scene in this movie has Jenkins in it and we watch as he starts to become something of the person he had long ago given up so he could just muddle through. A very thoughtful movie."
5,Loved It!,"I really enjoyed this movie. A middle-aged burnt-out professor arrives at his home in New York after an extended absence and finds a couple living there. He slowly gets caught up (willingly) in their lives and befriends them and even takes them under his wing. I won't reveal any of the major events of the movie, as I'm assuming if you're reading this, you haven't watched it yet, so I won't spoil it. But suffice it to say that it's funny, sad, dramatic, emotional, and thought-provoking all at the same time."
4,A Treasure,"This is an exquisitely done movie. The story grabs you and pulls you into the lives of its main characters so well that you almost wish you knew them in real life.I loved this movie. But it bothered me that I.C.E. was shown as a villain because it is not. Immigration laws are in place in the US for an important reason, just like in every other country. Even Mexico has zero tolerance for illegal immigrants, but they encourage their own to come here and break our laws as illegal immigrants.The perspective of this movie is one you don't get to see very often unless you have been through the experience of being an illegal immigrant. I really appreciated being able to better understand that situation, but I still support our country's laws. Without our laws, we would not be America."
3,Leaves You hanging,"This movie really gives you the prospective from the ""illegal's"" view. I enjoyed the movie but the movie just ends! No closure whatsoever. Does make you think on a new level. The ending is especially unsettling due to the turmoil currently going on in Syria. Makes you really question the characters' wellbeing."
2,White Guilt for Dummies,"Despite the gifted and attractive leads, this is the kind of film that gives liberals a bad name in an age where we need smart and passionate progressives more than ever."
3,Sympathy towards illegal immigration.,Richard Jenkins plays a lonely professor who is unhappy with his job at a Connecticut college teaching Economics. He has to go to a conference in NYC to present a colleagues paper. One reaching NYC he finds that a couple has illegally entered his apartment and are living there. The rest of the movie explores his relationship with the couple and their subsequent problems with immigration. The story arc fails to evoke any interest.It is not a bad movie but I feel that it did not deserve the attention and the critical acclaim that it received. It was just okay for me.
4,"Come for the Joy, Stay for the Despair and Anger","The visitor is a film about friendship, and leaving comfort behind to truly live. Walter is a widower and a college professor locked in a life and career that no longer holds any meaning for him. He is comfortable, lonely and bored. When he is forced to attend a conference in New York City he returns to his apartment for the first time since the death of his wife and finds a young couple illegally subletting the place. As Walter comes to know the two illegal immigrants as well as the young man's mother, he once again discovers joy in life, friendship, and love. He also finds despair and the cold hard reality of a society living in fear in a post 9/11 worldThe visitor is well acted and thought provoking. You will find yourself thinking about it for some time."
4,Great to see movies like this coming out!,"THE VISITOR made a strong impression on me.I loved the ""Buddy Picture"" aspect of the film.The direction by Tom McCarthy is honest, sensitive and very smart.Richard Jenkins gives a very subtle and moving performance. It is realy great to see actors delivering these kinds of performances and to allow the story to tell the story!The same goes for the intelligent performance by Hiam Abbass, who is compelling to watch.Hazz Sleiman is also great to watch as Abbas's congo playing son.What a joy for filmmakers to be making movies out of the norm. We may be witnessing a true rebirth of ""independent"" movie making."
4,It's never simple...,"Unexpected circumstances jar a grief stricken, socially stunted professor and help to propel him from existing into living. The initial catalyst is a young couple, immigrants who are proud, intelligent and illegal. The emotional bonds that develop between the characters are, in and of themselves, warm and rewarding. Conversely, the realities of a post 9/11 world complicate not only the immigrant's lives, but the viewer's emotional investment as well. The characters are attractive and appealing as they seek better lives for themselves. They're also law breakers with few skills or assets to offer a modern America. It's an interesting paradox and a (not completely successful) attempt to re-examine immigration in today's world."
4,The Visitor,Great story line & loved the actors in the movie. Only regret was the unexpecting ending to the story.
2,Out-Stayed its Welcome,"This review is for anyone who doesn't particularly care for dramas because....I don't particularly care for dramas.Sure there are some I like, ones that are a little more extreme like;American History X, Irreversible, A Time to Kill, Shawshank Redemption, Animal Factory, Devils Advocate etc.but I'm not exactly a fan.So going into this flick I had little to no expectation, which turned out to be a blessing.Yeah the story was interesting, and the characters intriguing enough,but at the end of the day it comes down to entertainment, and I just wasn't entertained.It was, to be painfully honest, just plain dull.The dialogue was subtle and practically non-existent and the whole movie just seemed empty & soulless.Maybe I'm a little biased or even jaded being a horror action junkie, but this flick just didn't do it for me.This one's for acquired tastes only.MORAL OF THE STORY:If If you aren't paying the bills than pack your bags."
2,"sloooooow, with abrupt end",This movie sounded great and it was a good clean movie with only one place where language was an issue. But the plot moved so slowly and the end was incredibly disappointing. Good thing i rented it at Red Box for just a dollar!
1,Waste of time and money!,This was being offered at 1.99 on Amazon Video on Demand.Had a very high rating on IMDB.Not worth the money and especially the time.
4,Should be not over looked....,"This movie was very, very good. I'm not into dramas that much, but, this cannot be over looked (as most of you know what happen to ""Crash"" as it won the upset in the Oscars)..this movie could be that movie, but, my worries lay in the slow space, either way, if you happen to see this movie at a rental store or whatever, please by all means, get this movie and you wont be sorry. Recommended!"
3,"Slow, thoughtful...","If you have the time to sit and ponder and watch--and you like independent, artsy type films, then you may enjoy this movie. If you struggle when movies move too slowly or like endings that wrap things up neatly instead of leaving you hanging, then I don't think you'd enjoy watching this movie.The acting is well done and believable. I enjoyed the character development in the film. But, at the end, I longed for a different ending. I know that this film is much more true to life, but I am one of those people who often enjoys watching movies to escape real life and be encouraged.The reason I am most glad to have watched this film is the insight it gives into the life of illegal immigrants in the United States."
1,"boring, beware","a complete waste of time, dont rent it, dont buy it, dont watch it. I read the reviews and am deeply disappointed. I hate to be so negative about this movie because i wanted to like it. but i just dont.sorry guys"
5,ANOTHER IMPRESSIVE FILM BY THE MAN WHO BROUGHT US THE STATION AGENT!,"Once again Tom McCarthy proves his talent making films. After seeing his first film 'The Station Agent' which is superb, 'The Visitor' is a wonderful and welcome surprise. Richard Jenkins performance is mesmerizing and the entire cast seem to be feeding from the same well in this interesting sometimes fun, sometimes sad drama. If you love movies this is a must see and if you liked this one you need to see 'The Station Agent' right now!"
4,Great Film... a little predictable though,"Very enjoyable, interesting premise, but after a while, the plot becomes fairly predictable. Still, would recommend watching."
3,Good game but the American version is lacking.,"This game is pretty fun. I don't like guitar hero because it's to easy, and I cant play DDR, I'm a fatty so I decided to go with this because I also like techno. The 7 buttons and a turn table combo gives me enough of a challenge to wrap my head around, then there are the modifiers such as 4x speed.The game itself is a beat game, by hitting a key you are adding music to the game, the better you do the better the song sounds. I gave this game a 5 for fun and 3 overall because the soundtrack on the American version is horrible but it's still fun to play. If you just want to try a new Bemani game I would tell you to try this, if you like it you might want to think about getting an import PS2 and importing the some of the others from a site like playasia."
3,"Beatmania, R&B and Hip Hop","If you love hip hop or r&b; then you are in luck, most of the songs on here are in that genre. Few dance tunes and mostly unfamiliar music grace the American version of Beatmania. While this is not necesarily all bad, I just feel most of the music could have been much better. Sometimes I think those at Konami must be slightly deaf because some music is just plain bad.It will take a lot of practice to play this game, if you are just beginning. It can be very frustrating, but practice makes perfect and in the end i'm sure it's worth it to show off to friends, etc..Also, the better you play the better the music is, as you play some of the notes yourself.Beatmania has a cool graphical interface and the controller is top notch. I'm sure they'll have future releases as well."
2,"A ""Dictionary"" instead of a good informative book.","I bought this book thinking of it as an informative one. It is a ""dictioanary"" not an encyclopedia, because the author doesn't explain too much about each angel.It contains a lot of angels including the fallen ones. I found information on this book very different from the information on other books of angels. That's why i am giving it this rate!!!!"
5,Wondeerful info.,This book has helped me with bing able to study the Angels and use it in my everyday life. A blessing.
4,asome!!!!!!!!!!! (sort of),"It is good, but not super goodit comes with 5 lightsabers, wich is good plus they are not like the light-up kind because the light-up kind can't come out of the guys hand.Greivous and his robot is awsome and Obi-wan is good too.But the set should have more pieces and the lizzard thing isn'tthe coolest. Still it'zz awsome"
2,This can't possilbly cost $135!,"I bought this for my son when he was about 5. He put it together in a few minutes and has been playing with it and the general ever since. While he loves it, the assembly was far too easy.However, if memory serves, I got it for about $20, not $150 (when you include postage). I simply cannot recommend it at that price, hence the low rating. Hey, I love LEGO, but this price must be for collectors only."
2,Kinda Dissappointing......,Of all the Episode 3 sets this is the most dissapointing. It isnt worth 20 dollars at all. The only reason to buy this set is for the figure of General Greivous.
2,Not for the web-savy racing fan!,"If you already have a good collection of racing ""favorites"" in your browser, then this book may not be for you. Although I found a ""few"" sites I didn't know, most of the sites were either main sites racing enthusiasts already knew or were people's personal sites. I did like the Teenie Bikini site (of course!) but as a webmaster and web enthusiast, I found the book a little disappointing."
4,The Off-Line Search Engine,"They say a person spends one-third of their life sleeping. Since becoming a motorsports site webmaster, I have found that number to be quite high! Thanks to this Incredible book, however, I am able to spend less time messing with unforgiving search engines ... and closing back in on that one-third number! Thanks for including our site and thank you for creating this handy roadmap to the information superspeedway."
5,Awesome movie,"The movie was just as good at the book was. It didnt leave out any of the important parts of the book,it followed the book very well. the book and the movie are GREAT!!! would recommand to anyone.."
3,"Well done, but didn't add much..","I absolutely loved the book, and although I liked the movie, I found something was lacking. For me it didn't add to the book, but it took some of the magic away.It's still a very moving story, a very interesting movie, and like someone else wrote: the kite flying scenes were really well filmed."
2,Bland Adaptation,Khaled Hosseini told a memorable story about two boys living in a country little known but often talked about today. Unfortunately the movie is like a paint by numbers adaptation rushing from one major plot point to the next. I understand how difficult it is to adapt a novel into film but it is possible to make a good one. This one felt rushed and retained none of the intimate details that made this story so memorable and touching. If it took another hour to tell it so be it. This celebrated and popular novel simply deserved better.
4,Kite Runner DVD vs Kite Rinner Novel,"I read the novel first and I couldn't put it down. Emotional, informative and interesting from beginning to end. I laughed, cried, talked out loud to myself, gave it to family members to read, and recommended it to others. Then I rented the DVD which I found tame in comparison. If you are not going to read the novel then I highly recommend the DVD because of it's superb acting, authentic scenes and an understanding of the cruelty of the Taliban in war-torn Afganistan,the class system that is ingrained into the culture causing conflict between childhood friends, loyalty, courage, and adult redemption. The ending is the most powerful of the entire story. Khaled Hosseini is a gifted writer whose other book ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"" is also amazing. I would read anything he writes in the future because of his tremendous insite into the human spirit,positive, negative, male or female."
3,Not a bad film,"Well, my girlfriend read the book and insisted on watching the movie. The story itself was thought provoking and entertaining with the exception of the fact that the majority was not in English and required reading subtitles for the majority of the flick. Besides being a nuisance, they were also in a hard to read color that pretty much blended into the background in most scenes."
5,Great view into the life through Afghanistan's turbulent history,"Great movie... Shows the dicotymy of life in Afghanistan before the Russians, with the Taliban, and preludes to life today post Taliban. Good movie making, kept me engaged and waiting to see what happens next. Awesome dynamic between characters."
5,A MUST SEE !!!,"This movie was recommended by my pastor. It is moving and powerful. You will love the powerful storyline of the two small boys, whose lives will be drastically changed by the descisions they make early in life. Make sure you have a box of tissues for the end."
5,1000% Awesome,"1. This is one of those rare movies that accurately captures the essence of the book. Furthermore, it is simply.. geniune. The script, the dialogue, the use of English vs the Afgan language seamlessly, the excellent acting from all involved--> it was just a really genuine film.2. A truly remarkable film, which should be seen by all adults."
3,Good Foreign Film,"With English subtitles. The rape scene was tastefully done (no nudity or expletives), so am not sure what all the controversy was about. As with most foreign films, it is difficult to focus on the emotional content of the principal characters when you have to read through the subtitles. Nevertheless, this film will surely be nominated for 2007 Best Foreign Film."
1,WARNING! BOY ON BOY RAPE!,"In this movie, child actors act out boy on boy rape. In my opinion, you should not rent or buy this movie, even if the book is on your child's school reading list. Granted, the scene doesn't go far, but it goes far enough to let you know what has happened. Now, THE REAL LIFE BOY ACTOR FEARS BEING ATTACKED because the movie offends Afghan dignity. (Source= http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3639956) This kid has been used. Compared to that kid, I am lucky. I am only out a few bucks for a movie that I will never finish watching. This movie should be rated R. Then I would not have allowed my children to rent it. If you write a review about this movie, please mention the boy on boy rape so that others can make an informed decision."
1,Kite Runner,"I probably would have given the movie ""Kite Runner"" a good review if I received it. Ordered it from spring4nix on May 26th, it never arrived."
1,Read the book!,"I watched this movie the same day I finished the book. The movie does not do the book justice. If you want to know the story of The Kite Runner, read the book.Overall, this movie was a huge disappointment."
4,Kite Runner soars!,"Having read the book I naturally could not wait to see the movie.Much to my surprise I love the movie more than the book. The difference, however, is that the book was able to give more background and helped me understand the story better. But the movie captures the essence and brings a better understanding of ""For you a thousand times over!"""
3,Uplifting but formulaic,"""Kite Runner"" has ""First Novel"" written all over it. Its depiction of 1970s Afghanistan is interesting, but its hackneyed and heavy-handed plot points of boyish antics, fathers, bullies, sexual assault, betrayal, ethnic prejudice and civil war seems too calculating by half, as if designed for the sole purpose of including all the requisite ingredients for one of the middlebrow choices of Oprah's Book of the Month Club. It's an uplifting story, and with fairly likeable characters, but there's just something about this story that was too predictable, amateurish and unsatisfying."
2,Disappointed,"The book was very interesting, informative and held the reader's attention. If a person had not read the book they would not have understood the movie. Three times I viewed the movie and could not locate the 'English option' therefore spent so much time trying to read the sub-titles that I saw very little of the movie. I was very disappointed."
2,Too Long,"The Kite Runner is incredibly long. This along with some intense scenes left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.I'll tell you what I thought of as this movie dragged on and on. Remember the Robin Williams movie Bicentennial Man?That's what it felt like I was watching. You follow this character from boyhood to adulthood. Near the end, once he adopted his step-whatever, I thought we'd continue and watch this new boy grow up.For heaven's sake, enough with the long, boring movies already.The actual film is interesting. Dealing with what it's like to live in Afghanistan before and after the Russians invaded and the rise of the Taliban, you get a very raw sense of how horrible it must have been for those living there.I don't recommend this movie unless you loved the book and enjoy long, drawn out films."
4,a debt,It is unusual that a movie about a character's cowardice can also be a feel-good story. Well acted and exotic this is a film that sneaks up on the viewers and fills them with hope.
4,Best screen adaptation of a book I can remember,I really can't recall ever watching a film when I had read the book where the film followed the story as well as this one did. I even forgot to be annoyed by the subtitles!
4,Good Movie -- Interesting Look at Afghanistan,"I read the book before seeing the movie, so of course I assumed the book would be better as it usually is. I was correct in this case, but the movie was much better than I expected and followed along closely to the book.The story is about two boys who grow up in Afghanistan. One was able to escape to America with his father when the Russians invaded in 1978. He then returned to Afghanistan many years later to take care of some unfinished business for his friend who was left behind.I already knew I would like the story, and I found the acting superb. I have no complaints other than the fact that the ending was a little far-fetched, which I also pointed out in my book review.I still would recommend the movie. It's the best I've seen in months."
5,A great movie that touches your soul,"There are a few movies that touch your Heart & soul & we remember them forever..This is one such movie..& sometime in future when someone asks you to name some of your favourite all time movies, this might be one of them..so sit back & enjoy every moment of this very well made film with someone you love."
4,Perfect Carrying Case,This case is great for your GAME BOY ADVANCE/SPit holds a lot of games I wish it had a specific place forthe Add-Ons or you can just stuff them in (LIKE ME)SO BUY THEIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Sales Advantage by Crome,"This is a good introductory work for a salesperson orsomeone opening his/her own business. The author teacheshow to develop credibility, interest, stories, instructionalapproaches, needs analysis and a host of other components aimedat cultivating customer sales. Later on, the work buildsupon a negotiation scheme involving information gathering,resolution of concerns, conflict resolution, collaboration,customer needs and multiple solution sets in order to producea successful sale through advanced negotiation techniques.The thrust of the work teaches how to gain and cultivatecustomer commitments. The book is a good introductoryrendition for budding salespeople. It will provide reinforcementfor experienced salespeople."
2,Disappointing at Best,"As an agent for one of the largest life insurance companies in the world, I am always looking for ""THAT"" book which will reveal a missed point that can give the edge over my very capable competition. When I saw this I thought this might be it. After reading this book, my search must continue. The book may hold some value for someone brand new to the field of sales, but for anyone who has sold for more than a few months, the teachings are old hat with no nuggets to be found. I have other Carnegie books and this one is not worthy to be on the shelf beside the others. I would recommend books by Tracy or maybe ""SuperSelf"" by Charles Givens. Now there is a book to chew on for days. My advice, save your money and buy something else."
1,This Book Is A Racket!,"We've reached a era as consumers where we stop questioning what others waive in front of our noses and accept it as good for us. This Kindle thing is a racket! Amazon wants $18 for this book in Kindle form. You must think most of us have the mind of a 10 year-old and will not realize you are marketing to suckers. It costs you pennies to upload these files and you are profitting from the frenzy of consumers who are buying with their emotions instead of their minds. Shame on you, Amazon. You represent the sad aspect of capitalism that most of us detest."
3,Calm or Boring?,"I've tried several different screensaver type DVDs for my office bigscreen, which I use to create ambience for in-office coaching client visits. This one wound up on the bottom of the heap. A sky that's orange, or pink, or green, is just weird. That leaves blue, which is very nice. But the music leaves much to be desired, and the DVD hiccups a lot. I would not purchase this again given the chance.Colorcalm - Skies"
2,Style vs. Content,"Great packaging & presentation, a superb idea .... but very little content. A fine example of style over substance.Ultimately this product is no more than a screen-saver for your TV. If you plan on using this on your PC / MAC - then I'm sure that you could download something for free over the internet, that will more than match this product.Save your money, open the blinds and take a good look at the real thing.A disappointing purchase."
5,Great Writing,"Every once in a while a compilation will come out that is an actual literary work.Whether you agree or not with the content, the writing is excellennt. Well writen, informative and intelligent.Now for the content.""These events have taught us the not altogether surprising lesson that when the government is allowed to avoid the safeguards designed to protect the innocent, many innocents suffer.""There are a few good examples of history when the US has pushed the boundaries and has paid the price. These lessons learned are discussed and analyzed with our present situation. There are good examples and explanations of certain sections of the Patriot Act and what the possible ramifications are.While I agree the scrutiny to our security is important it is increasingly important that the checks and balances put in place by the people who learned the lessons of the past are used to protect the innocent fish pull up by the gill nets."
1,Ringing false alarms,"This screed offers nothing of value. It is liberal fear mongering and slander of John Ashcroft because he is a conservative Christian, a Republican and an attorney-general who is doing his job. You only have something to fear from the Patriot Act if you are doing something wrong! The Patriot Act has not squashed political dissent or freedom of the press. It's absurd to suggest so. Maybe all these liberal fear mongers should spend some time in Iran or North Korea to understand true loss of liberties. As for the extra attention paid visitors from Arab countries, it is only common sense because those countries are the source of anti-US terror! I laugh at the politically correct lament over racial profiling. As a foreigner in the US, I am thankful for the additional security at airports and the watchful surveillance of so-called Islamic charities and Iranian diplomats taking photographs of public buildings."
3,Nice Contemporary Look at US Immigration,"This was a really typically good PBS documentary that took contemporary stories of immigration and fed them back into history. The first and last episodes were particularly good. The first episode looked at the current issue of Mexican immigration and then looked at the long history of specific group immigration to the US through a clever lens (Norway, China, Mexico, Ireland). I really enjoyed their look at Norway and Ireland and the way that they juxtaposed the Nativist Movement of the late 19th century with current anti-immigration sentiment. The last episode was also really good, focusing on the experiences of female immigrants and the shocking situations they escape to reach some idea of freedom. As a history professor and an immigrant myself I thought this series was really great - easily accessible for students, nice personal stories, and good historical context. I'll be using it in my Freshman US history classes for sure."
1,"Terrible, a waste of money!","With the PBS Banner I expected a quality product. This is not. It is boring, slow moving, not worth watching. A total waste of money. I would have liked at least something on Ellis Island. There was a lot of repeating, and repeating. Tells individual stories, but not well."
5,"A great ""Film""","What does ""Sommersby"" have to do with anything of this? If you compare them you are a simpleton.This is a grand movie that uses many film medium options - watch the grain and contrast of the film stock change - see the lighting and pulled shots. This is a classic ""Film."" Superb script and acting. Hear the last lines of the narrator. Vigne used all filming options available to him and he used them with taste. Watch closely - this is to be enjoyed on many levels - watch the Father sign in a symbol for the family name and note the son's problem . . . . If the last line of the narrator when ""Martin"" dies doesn't stick with you then you just don't get it. Go back to Hollywood drivel."
5,One of the Best Ever,"I first saw this movie years ago when it was first released. It is the ONLY movie I ever left, bought another ticket for, and then went back in to watch a second time. It is mesmerizing. The film is beautifully shot, often looking like a series of oil paintings rather than film. But the beauty of the cinematography is nothing compared to the story itself. It is a legal thriller and a classic romance. While some consider this to be one of Depardieu's greatest films, the real star of this movie is Nathalie Baye, who plays Martin Guerre's wife. She makes believable the behavior of the film's most complex character. Avoid the dubbed version even if you don't know French. The actors who supply the English-speaking voices are terrible."
3,Pangai Noon DVD,I was a little disappointed with this DVD. The overall length is short and the opening graphics make it shorter. I would have preferred to see Master Gushi perform all segments of the DVD. I did enjoy seeing Master Gushi's katas...the slow motion and multiple camera angles are nice.
3,"Good story, but not written for true Voyager fans.","I read this book and found that many of the characters just were not like on the TV series. You can especially see this in Captain Janeway. Not to mention the drawn-out descriptions of the characters. My recommendation, if you read this book then make SURE you watch at least 1 episode of the TV series to get an ACCURATE idea of the character's personalites."
3,A slow starter,It's obvious when you start reading this book that the author knows they need to stretch out the story line over 3 books. I've seen long movies that haven't needed to be this slow at starting yet the book crawls along at its beginning. Don't let this stop you though. Once you get into it a diverse story begins to unfold with your mind trying to second-guess what's coming next. Unless you jump to the end chapter you won't be able to so don't try. A good read and one that preps you for the next installment.
1,DARK MATTERS Doesn't Matter,"Sadly, this is a misfire for Christie Golden, who has previously turned in some stellar work on the Star Trek VOYAGER series for Pocket Books. The intriguing return of one of VOYAGER's (TV series) more enduring cameos, Romulan scientist Telek R'Mor, is quickly besmirched when we learn that this humble scientist some poignantly and heart-tuggingly played in a television episode is actually one of Romulus's leading scientific minds! That, and he's agreed to wage a campaign against the USS Voyager! This simple characterization bastardizes everything that the viewing audience came to respect from so richly drawn a character, and, for that, Ms. Golden should be ashamed. Utter misfires and cliches aside, the reader is left to a seemingly incomprehensible plot that can have no meaningful nor realistic scientific conclusion. DARK MATTERS is a territory best left unexplored."
4,Cloak and Dagger,"This was a very good introduction on the trilogy ""Dark Matters"". I've enjoyed Christie Golden's books for some time now and this is one of them. If you love Star Trek Voyager, this is great story to read. You'll be pining for more! :)"
5,"Parakeets, by: Annette Wolter, the A+ parakeet factbook","This book is the ultimate book for soon-to-be or already parakeet owners. It holds more information on parakeets than I imagined. I am a soon-to-be parakeet owner who was looking for a good book on parakeet care and training. I found this book and immediately knew that I'd have to buy it for further reference! This book holds information on: hand and trust training, tips for purchasing a parakeet, states what you'll need for your parakeet, information on toys, prevention of diseases and boredom, and much much more! I cannot even begin to describe the whole book. Annette Wolter refers to her life experiences with her parakeets that helped me to understand better what to expect from parakeets. This book DEFINITELY deserves MORE than 5 stars! Looking for a REALLY good parakeet owner's manual? This IS the book for you!"
3,An educational manual,"Authored by Annette Wolter, this manual on parakeets was published in 1999. There are 87 pages. Eight chapters are contained. Numerous color photos and black-and-white drawings are provided. Also, an index is included. The anecdotes the author supplies are informative. Examples of topics covered are tips on purchasing, bathing, care, toys, diet, health, breeding, cages, taming, teaching the parakeet how to talk, intelligence, and behavior. I find the chapter focusing on behavior to be instructive and fascinating. In addition, two tables are displayed; one deals with dangers to the parakeet, while the other deals with health problems. The color photos of the parakeets are pleasing. As for the black-and-white drawings, they are impressive and educational. I recommend this manual."
2,informative but not complete,"Some of the information is great, but it still left me with questions. So the title ""A Complete Pet Owner's Manual"" is misleading.It does have good information on diet and health and exercise.But it seems like an overview. But I was looking for more than an overview. The title should be ""Parakeets, an overview for the new owner"" More details please!"
4,Droid Tri-Fighter,This is toy is really worth it. It is slightly smaller than the newer one but it comes with a rare buzz droid that does not come with any other set (at least to my knowledge).
5,Beautiful,"I can't even begin to do this release justice in words... the playing is flawless, the compositions and arrangments beautiful, and overall, perfect. Buy it and play it over and over and over again... this is truly a musical journey for the body, mind, and soul."
1,Skeletons in the closet - maybe they should be left there...,"Uli is as good as any guitarist when he is at his best. Prologue to the Symphonic Legends and Beyond the Astral Skies are two of the greatest CDs ever made. It is as if Mozart and Jimi Hendrix had a kid and the kid was Uli. Unfortunately this CD is a bizarre mish mash of junk Uli has recorded over the years. Some of it is interesting, like the first song, but a lot of it is boring, like the classical covers... who cares if Uli can do a mediocre rendition of a Vivaldi piece on the electric guitar. If you can't play it extremely well, or you can't do something innovative with it (other than just playing it on the electric guitar), you are better off working in your home studio doing the sequel to Prologue to the Symphonic Legends. Uli is not the most productive musician around, with just three CD releases in the last 16 years. Let's just hope he is hard at work on his second symphonic masterpiece. Then all will be forgiven."
3,3 colors not 7,"I have tried several interior glow kits, this one is just ok. The effects are nice, I have a great sound system in my car so the sound mode that is supposed to react to the music works well. The only complaint I have about this kit is that there is only a Red, Green, and Blue setting. To get the purple, and teal colors the lights combine (red+ blue to = purple, then green+ blue to = teal). Theres 6 bulbs of each color on each strip. I just think they should be more clear with the description. Overall good buy for the price, but may change back to good ol' StreetGlow once the fuse or something goes in this kit."
2,Disappointing,"Bought these with the intention of getting footwell LEDs for cheap. The phrase ""you get what you pay for"" has never been more true, because these stopped working on me after about six weeks. Its especially rough because when they did work - briefly - they were SO cool. Everyone loved them. Had them professionally installed and everything. Save some money and spring for higher quality LEDs."
4,Easy way to make music line up with lighting---Need aftermarket amp though,"For those of you that are struggling with getting the LED lights to line up with the music, the best advice I can give to you is IF you have an aftermarket amplifier, then hook the LEDs up to the terminals on the amp. Positive to positive, negative to negative. I did this and mine work much better then before. Give it a shot..."
2,Not as advertised!!,"Received this product today, THERE ARE NOT 7 DIFFERENT COLORS!! Rather there are 7 combinations of colors, (you can have more than one color on at a time.) White is not a choice in color, terrible as this is one of the reasons why I purchased this kit. other than that, the LEDs are pretty bright. Nice vivid colors, but FALSELY ADVERTISED!!"
5,Sick!,"These LED lights are awesome! They are super bright, although probably illegal to drive at night with. The strobe light is pretty amazing, it actually matches music pretty well, even if it is a little laggy occasionally. The wires aren't extremely long, so you don't have a whole lot of options on where to place the lights. You are pretty much limited to front under the dash and under the back of the front seats (shining at the rear seats). The wires are probably not long enough to go under the rear seats, though. Also, one thing that threw me off a little was the ""7 color"" led is actually a mixture of 3 primary colors. You only notic this if you look directly at the lights or if you have the lights too close to the floor. The control box isn't the easiest and most practical remote, but it does its job. Overall, it is an amazing buy and for $35, that is just crazy awesome. Definitely recommend!"
3,pretty cool,"it is pretty hard to install, i had to get a friend to do it and even he had troubles, once you get it up its pretty cool in the night time if you put it in your car"
1,Caught on FIRE!,"Transistor caught on fire after only 31 days of use. Connected using optional cig lighter adapter. You get what you pay for. Driving down the highway and without warning, poof! Luckily I was able to put it out before damage to my Jeep occured!"
1,broke,I bought this about 6 months ago and it worked fine all up untill today. Nothing was exposed and my lights are stuck on. The only way to turn them off is to cut the main power. The lights wont flash or anything. I cant get a hold of the seller eather to try and figure out what is wrong with them.
4,Ok,Bought this for my son for Christmas and he said it was difficult to hook up but he was ok with it.
5,5 star r3vi3w,i one day shipped this product got it quick . . . . . .packaged ok. . . . no problems with it. lights my whole damn car up . . . . . had no problems with this product highly reccomended because led's are so expensiveanother hot review. . . . SYRUS
4,Looks fantastic,I was amazed at how fast it came I got the shipping notice the day before I got the kit... Took awhile to find a nice way to route and channel all the wires but after that set up like a charm. Took about 2 hours including brainstorming and almost accidentally grounding out my battery. looks awesome at night and was brighter than i expected. I wound up mounting 2 under the front dash and 2 on the back of the front seats facing the third row. Wound up using double stick tape after breaking a drill bit trying to drill starter holes. The kit looks awesome with the music feature on. I'm also able to set it on whatever solid color suits my mood.
4,Great Product / Great Service,"Two days after I ordered these LEDs, they arrived at my house. I installed them the next day and they looked great and illuminated the floor very well. My friends and I watched them flash to the music and it was pretty cool. The only thing that could be better is the sensitivity for the music because on a lower/normal volume, the console does not pick up the music as well."
1,not satified,"terrible product ,in the first 3 days a total of 8 lights are not working on one tub! also the wire is very short and materials for this is very cheap and feels like it will break fast. not satisfied with it!!!"
4,Light it up,"I have an 07 honda fit, and there is no floor lighting whatsoever. I got these for aesthetics, but they have really come in hand as interior lighting. Inexpensive, easy to install and mount. There are probably more expensive kits on the market, but these took me 15 minutes to put in; the hardest part was figuring out which fuse panel to connect them to."
2,the sound activation sucks!!!!,the sound activation is really really bad. the lights do not go to the beat at all. make sure you know where you are going to mount them at because mounting is difficult. the light patterns suck!!! the lights are bright though. thats the only good thing
3,Not user friendly!!!!!!,I just hooked up lights. Not very easy to install. You really need to know what you are diong to install these. Also the way the wires come out of the top and the bottom of the remote you cant mount it. Reason it will look like crap! IM not sure what to do with the wires. The remote is just sitting on my center console. With the wires sticking out and it lookes like crap! The lights look cool from what i can see it is still daytime. Im not sure if im going to keep these or not. I will waite to see what it looks like at night. Maybe i can deal with the crappy looking wire if the lights are cool. Not a well thought out product. It needs to be improved! Also the first thing it says in the instructions. This product must be installed by a pro. They should tell you that!!!
2,Poor Quality,When I installed the led lights...the blue lights on one of my tubes didnt work and the positive wire is ripped inside so I have to move it around in order for it to work. They sent me a crappy one.!
4,its decent,"Received this after shopping around. the price was the biggest factor. it comes with six LED's three different color LED's per tube, and the dimmer function on the side does not work with the way i installed it, hard wire through a spare 12v dc. the wires between the led tubes and controller are pretty thick, that caught me off guard. i wouldve preferred that the connection between the tube and controller was able to disconnect. plenty of wire to do what you wish in a small car ('07 saturn ion 1)colors dont match picture the ""white"" is a blend of red, blue, and green, and the distribution is off so it's not really ""white"" and the led's them selves dont change, the colors are based on RBG color combination. the installation is... different. screws and x1 single doublesided adhesive (for the controller) is provided but that limits installation possibilities, for instance, i do not wish to screw the tubes into my car. all in all, its a nice product."
3,it still works.,"The light scheme is really cool.I bought this product a few years back and its still kickin.The only problem I have is it doesn't come with the options to blink to the music. I wish it came with that option being the price it is.The blue plastic pieces seem to get brittle after a few years with the heat in the car. It's not hard to just zip tie them down though.At the time it seemed really cool to own, really easy to install too. If you know what you're doing."
5,great,product works great. extremely satisfied. highly recommended. i really like the color variations and the patterns of which they flash.
4,"Good stuff, not that bright.","I love this product, only thing is they could've made it a little bit more powerful. I farted."
1,they dont work period,when i bought them they didnt work at all. and its not that i dont know how to install them My father went to college for two years in electrical work. and my brother is majoring as a mechanical engineer and we couldnt get them to work. it just doesnt work and i cant figure out how to return them for my money back. my suggestion is dont buy these
1,Do Not Get!,"You will not be able to hook these neon led lights from amazon up without the help of a mechanic. When I read the reviews I thought I would be able to follow the directions and find help online but you can't. You need to hook them up directly to the battery which is dangerous, especially if you do it yourself. The other option is to get an adapter in your cigarette lighter which I did next, and that did not work either."
4,good solid product,took only of 20 minutes to install. lots of patterns that go through all the colors....that being said if u want one particular color. in different patterns or with the music it wont work...solid colors or flaching rainbow are your options.
4,Great Buy!,"Length:: 0:44 MinsNice lights, worth every penny I spent. The only thing that I dislike is that when the lights are on sound mode, The lights still flash when the music is not playing. Overall, great set, and its an easy install."
3,A RERUN CD,"a TRUE DIE HARD CHER FAN WOULD WANT TO SEE THE RELEASE OF HER OBSCURE RECORD AS BONNIE JO MASN,""RINGO,I LOVE YOU"",HALE & HE HUSHABYES,'YES SIR,THAT'S MY BABY""AND OTHER OBSCURE CHER SONGS LIKE 3614 JACKSON HWY THAT WAS JUST RELEASED FROM RHINO HANDMADE.SEVERAL TRACKS THAT WERE MEANT FOR A 2ND LP,WHICH NEVER SAW THE LIGHT OF DAY.I'M SURE IF ANYONE OPENED THE CER VAULTS THERE'D BE PLENTY OF OBSCURE SONGS,EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO GO TO HER OLD TV SHOWS WITH SONNY AND HER SOLO SERIES TO LIFT SONGS.COME ON,IF EVERY BEATLE TRACK CAN BE RELAESED THAT WAS EVER RECORDED,STOPFOOLING US CHER FANS WITH REPACKAGED STUFF LIKE WE'RE GETTING SOMETHING NEW BESIDES A NEW CD COVER."
5,rare good learning dictionary for spanish learners,"There are two types of monolingual dictionaries. One is the reference dictionary for who is familiar with the language. The others is the learning dictionary that helps foreigner's learn the language featuring providing the defintions with limited vocabularies, usage explanations and examples. The Longman and Collins lead the market for the Enlish language, Langensheid for German, Larouss for French. Vox for Spanish. The only monolingua reference dictionary for learning Spanish.It deserves."
5,BAM!,Emeril is always fun to watch and a great instructor. I recommend this to anyone with an iterest in the culinary arts or simply wanting to become a better cook.
3,Lots of fog!,"I was impressed with the amount of fog this unit delivers. Placed it in my garden pond and it immeadeatly put out a nice cloud that hung over the water. 2 stars off for the led lights which seem harsh and abruptly change color. It would have been nice to have the option to turn the lights off, or down, and to choose the color instead of it clicking over to a different color every few seconds."
3,Just (a bit) Strange,"'Rich and Strange' isn't a thriller and there are none of Hitchcock's trademark suspense scenes, in fact I'd describe it as a 'light-hearted adventure'. The saving grace of this early Hitchcock talkie is that it's slightly off the wall. There are just some scenes when you think 'is this guy serious or just taking the Mickey'? Contrary to what I've heard elsewhere, Joan Barry and Henry Kendall make quite good leads and there is enough of a storyline to keep the viewer interested. So, if you're thinking of buying some early Hitchcock material this DVD is worth a look, especially at Laserlight's budget price."
2,Tony Curtis strikes again!,"This is a weird little movie. Not typical Hitchcock fare by any stretch of the imagination. Not suspense, kind of a drama with a bit of comedy mixed in. Most of it plays kind of like a travelogue-- this couple inherits some money and go on an extended vacation. This Laserlight DVD edition includes a brief, but very entertaining, introduction by Tony Curtis. He hosts many of the old movies Laserlight has released to DVD. He has a very bizarre way of delivering these little intros that provide some background info on the film. This disc also includes the original theatrical trailer for Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", as well as a half-hour episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. So even though the movie is nothing to write home about, if you have an interest in early Hitchcock you can't beat this one, considering the low cost."
2,Videonow Video Now Color NICK Spongebob Squarepants PVD SB4,My grandson liked it but I'm not to fond of Spongebob! Entertaining for younger kids.
3,WAS a very good game,"Back when this first came out, it was one of the only games I enjoyed playing on wifi. I didn't even bother playing on story mode because it was so much fun. Now, it seems, they've shut down the servers and online play is all but impossible. It's a shame and now all it does is collect dust in my collection of unplayable games."
2,A nice try...,"This book was alright... It is not anything special and if you really want to know about the special forces you can easily find out tons more information on the internet. Theres also some really good books by former special forces operators that will give you really great information. I recommend ""Warrior Soul"" by Chuck Pfarrer. This book also lacks information about Canada's special forces, JTF2 (somewhat disapointing as i am Canadian). Overall there are some other errors in the book. This book would be good for children as it is at their reading level and the information is very non-descript and easy to remember the random facts that this book is full of. Basically i was not impressed but it was a good try."
5,Profits Over People,"Michael Bowker has done a thorough and compelling job of telling how asbestos has ravaged the American work force in the past halfcentury. 'Fatal Deception' not only provides an insider's look at the history of this dangerous mineral, but wraps it around an epic disaster which has been occurring for decades in the small town of Libby, Montana. I know this story, because I have produced a documentary on the town called 'Dust to Dust', which Michael Bowker has generously credited in his book. 'Fatal Deception' takes the reader behind the headlines and reveals the disbelief EPA investigators had until confronted with the awful truth of Libby.The book is like a good suspense novel, but unfortunately, the story is all too real.I highly recommend it."
2,The writing leaves something to be desired.,"The story told in this book is shocking and should be more widely known - unfortunately the writing in this book is disjointed and poorly organized. After a while, I became bored simply because there was no continuous thread in the book leading me forward - just an assemblage of anecdotes with no real cumulative effect. This is a shame because the story should be far more riveting than it is - and it would be, if told by a more skillful writer - for instance, if this book had been written by Jonathan Harr, author of ""A Civil Action."""
4,Major omission on this one!,"The listing of this DVD sounds like you are getting a cheapWalmart unknown artist on a bargin basement DVD.NOT!No wheredoes it say that the artist on Desert Vision is none other than David Lanz and is a video duplicate of his CD by the same name. So, if you don't know Mr. Lanz, he is (IMHO) the premire pianist of our age. His many CDs are in my collection and are the best of all my music. Don't take my word for it. Find his CDs on Amazon and visit his web site [...]The Desert Visions DVD is great. Serves well as video/audio background and discussion when friends are relaxing or having dinner at my place. Try it. END"
4,Really fun to play,"This is a pretty good game if you just want to blast the crap out some very gruesome looking zombies. The game play is a bit flawed but nothing that would take all the fun out of it...at least for me. Sometimes when you're shooting at the head of a zombie its arm falls off, or you hit them in the chest and their legs blow off. No big deal, but one thing that did kind of piss me off was sometimes when using a shotgun at close range the zombie barely flinches!!! What kind of crap is that?? A gun like that makes whatever it hits into big chunks of blubber...but whatever. The sounds of the game is its strong point I think, when playing with headphones you can actually hear something coming up from behind you...pretty creepy. If you're a gaming purist, you probably wont like this game due to its flaws. But if you're in it to watch some gore splatter and have a few jumps in your seat than I think you'll enjoy it."
4,Good Game for the price,Ill start off by saying that if this game were to cost more than $20 I would have given it less stars but because it is only $20 it is a fair deal. LOTD is a fun game but dont expect any top of the line effects or art as in shooters like FEAR or HALF LIFE 2 because if you do you may be disappointed. The graphics in this game are not bad but not really impressive. The sounds are great and the music definitely sets and fits the horror tone to the game. Gameplay is just like other 1st person shooters but this game has some glitches and feels a little more sluggish than other 1st person shooters like FEAR or HALF LIFE 2. The story is not a bad one but not an excelent one just average but enough to keep you interested. Overall this is a good game for $20 especially for horror fans and people who like shooters. Worth it.
1,This game is just so-so,"I'm a big, big fan of George A. Romero's movies and the zombie genre, so I was happy to find a game with a true zombie plot line. But, I was disappointed. I guess it was my fault for expecting much from a video game from a movie. I should have known to expect very little, and that's what I got. The graphics are mediocre, the sound is O.K., the action is simple, the AI is almost non-existent, the gameplay is basically walking through a giant maze and shooting stuff. I can compliment the ""feel"" of the game, as it was creepy and there were a couple of times when I actually jumped. But it took me less than 5 hours to finish the game on High difficulty. Not quite worth the $20 I spent."
1,"Poor game, nothing as expected.","The game is nothing as you expect it to be. I expected to be able to go up to a zombie and blow his head off, but in this game it takes like three shots aimed at the head just to make a zombie fall down. The music in the game makes a bit scary at first, but then just gets annoying. When the zombies attack they freakin punch or slap you! What the hell! If you were looking for Resident Evil action in 1st person, sorry no good here. If you were looking for mass zombie killin, sorry no good here either. This game was a dissapointment by far, i wish i could my money back. The graphics of the game are alright though, you can see the blood and gore, but it just still doesn't cut it. Overall, the game is just not worth it."
2,Nice Graphics but overall disappointing,Zombie AI was just bad. Scripted events if you ducked back fast enough would cause the Zombie to stand still while you shot at them. Also it was so short a game I am glad that I got it for cheap. It took me alittle over 2 hrs to beat the game. I'd say wait till this puppy hits the $10 rack or becomes abandonware.
2,good practice shooter game,"when i get tired of being killed in doom3 or quake or half life2 or painkiller or 10 other games, i can relax and frag some (...)."
2,The Big Cheez,"First of all, I gave this game 5 stars across the board. Evidently Amazon didn't believe me when I clicked on 5 stars. Anyway, I think it was $20 well spent. If you like the ""Dead"" movies and are into zombies, your gonna love this game. If your planning on spending the $20 and expecting to get into the ""high rent"" district, ain't gonna happen. But, the graphics are cool, the music draws you in and the overall ambiance of the game is all there. Yeah, you have to shoot a few of them several times in the head but remember, you have to shoot them in the brain, not just in the head. So, I have no complaints. It's fun and it's a great game, not a $500 watch. So get the game and turn out the lights, draw down the shades and pull up your favorite chair in front of the screen 'cause your in for a treat."
3,Cool zombie game but it is a very short game too.,I really do still love this game though and I would recommend everyone who loves zombies to buy this game. The only downfall with this game is that it was beat by me in 3 hours on normal and in 2 hours on hard. Still I have played it several times and like I said I really enjoyed it. word of advice for people who are using XP or better if you cant get the game to work because you are getting a error code right click on the shortcut on your desktop and click on properties and then click on compatibility and then check run compatibility mode of windows 98/me and it works fine. Also apparently the game maker is out of business cause I tried to contact them and tried to go onto their website but it was no good.
3,Low budget zombie shooter,"If the price is right ($15 or less), this is an ok game. The graphics were annoyingly low contrast in the darker settings (which is most of the time).Weapons included a couple of pistols, a .22 caliber rifle, a shot gun, an M16, a sniper rifle (my favorite), Molotov Cocktails, and grenades. In addition, there are shovels, baseball bats, lead pipes, etc for you to use in hand-to-hand combat. Settings included a garage, sewer, hospital, and high-rise apartment building. Health and ammo were fairly abundant (at least on the medium difficulty), but it got a little old having to search every desk and cabinet for them.At the medium difficulty it was not particularly challenging, but it was acceptable and reasonably entertaining. Overall, I'd say it was on the low end of average for a 2005 game and it's one of the shortest games I've played in a while. I got this new elsewhere for $13 plus shipping. If you pay much for this game, you will probably be disappointed."
2,"Sorry Sizzla, this one is really weak","Mr. Kalonji must have run out of creative juices for this one. Actually, some songs are different, but there are not many that are good. The best song (they only great one?) is Be Strong. Buy it by itself and leave the rest. If you want a KILLER Sizzla album, get Da Real Thing or Black Woman and Child."
2,Not Good,"I love Sizzla, but this album has only a few hot ones. Not a good album......Far from Sizzla quality."
5,Brilliant Author,"Gileadi has so much information in this book. It is definitely not an easy read, but is very valuable as a reference book and to gain knowledge of a deeper meaning of Isaiah."
3,Irritating,"I've not yet finished the book but the Silly Git thing is really getting on my nerves. It's such a stupid, insipid name for anyone much less an evil douchebag that should have been called something like Satin or Psycho. Truely, its ruining the book for me. It just makes me cringe everytime it comes up."
3,Sad,This book was a really hard read. It is crazy everything Jane l had to go thru. I loved how she was able to climb back onto her feet later in life. It gives people who haven't gone thru that no excuse to be strong and to stand up for yourself.
5,A childhood most never survive,"Jane Elliot lived through a childhood that most never survive to tell the tale.The things this woman went through are unimaginable horrors. From being a sex, and domestic slave for 17 years to being beat down for speaking out against her abuser by her very own brothers.I'm angry that her mother was never charged with neglect. I know Jane wants to believe that her mom didn't know about the sexual abuse she endured but deep down I think she knows that really her mother could have cared less.This is a tale of survival. Once you open this book you will not want to set it down."
5,The Tears Kept Falling,"Only two books have ever made me feel so emotional, ""THE LITTLE PRISONER"" and ""NIGHTMARES ECHO"". Both tell of child abuse-sexual abuse and both are hard to put down until you have read every page. You will feel for the authors, urging them on...wishing you could make the tough decisions for them and realizing...oh my gawd the courage they have."
5,Astonishing!,"As difficult as this is to read, I am happy that the author was able to face her demons and begin the life long healing process that she is facing. Unlike other books I have read about child abuse, she followed through and put the worthless piece of crap who tormented her behind bars. Her mother will forever have to live with the fact that she condoned and encouraged her daughter's abuse. Well done Jane!"
5,Great use of the Wii,"I've played guitar recreationally for over 20 years and played the previous Guitar Hero versions at my local electronics store and it's no exaggeration to say GHIII for the Wii *rocks*! The songs are more technically intricate than in previous versions and the story-line is engaging. I'm also really delighted by the art, which seems more influenced by urban art and Heavy Metal comics than by your standard animation interface. I've played one easy song for two hours and enjoyed myself immensely. My band geek roommate, who never plays video games, was so intrigued she wanted to try."
4,Rock Out...,"This is a great game. If you were a fan of Guitar Hero 2, you will not be dissapointed. I was very excited when I found out that the Guitar Hero 3 would be coming out for Wii. The guitar controller is easy to use, and the wii-mote snaps right in.The only complaint I have so far is that the last song on the Hard Level is damn near impossible."
2,WARNING for Parentsw,"I'm writing this to warn parents. This is a VERY fun game, but be aware there are LOTS of satanic images and themes in this game. I hear World Tour is better. For some reason there is a concert tour on this game that is all about hell and demons and satanic stuff. There are very scary images for children (i know it's rated Teen, but come on. We all know young children are playing this game). If you don't want your kids seeing satanic images and listening to lyrics like 666 and stuff about suicide and The Beast...get a different GH. I am going to have to stop playing mine in front of my toddler because it's too scary and she really is enthralled by it. Also, the female characters are pretty oversexualized, thongs hanging out, breasts barely covered....why is this necessary? I wish gamers would think about families. It is a really fun game so it's a shame some of the fun is marred by this kind of stuff."
4,Pretty fun,I play a little guitar and I found it not that easy to pass the easy level and struggling on medium. Its great for anyone who is thinking of starting to learn the guitar. Mastering this game would definitely help!
3,Game Rock but equipment DOESNT,I bought this the day it came out because of the rumble option. Because i also own a ps3 but got it for wii instead. Had it for less than a week and the green botton was stickiing bad and the others were starting to stick also. So beware if you buy make sure everything is working before u run out time to return the product. Great game though enjoy
3,Guitar Hero III is fun but.....,"Can someone tell me why in this day and age that the designers didn't think of the left handed people in the world. The guitar (for all the systems) is designed for the right handed person. And nowhere on the box does in say that. I hear, "" just flip it over there's no difference! There is a difference, it's upside down. The whammy bar is on top and the rounded edges of the chords are on top. I get to press the square edge and the fingers do no move as freely over the square edge as they do on the rounded side. So were the lefty's invisible on the day this game was thought up? The game is fun, but I would like it more if I could get a left handed guitar."
1,No Sound?,"First of all, this game sells for $89.99, so don't pay more than that. We bought GH3 for my daughter's Wii, and were surprised and saddened that there was no sound at all. The sound was fine in other games, just not GH3. After doing some research on line, it turns out that the maker of the game, Activision, is being sued for false advertising. It turns out that while it advertises that it handles Dolby Surround sound stereo, it actually only does that for the other platforms. For the Wii, it only spits out mono. Activision has no time frame as to when they'll be coming out with a patch. Even then the patch might only be available for download if you connect your Wii to the internet. We decided to return GH3 and get something else."
2,"Don't be impressed by the ""70+ songs"" on this game...","I don't know about you or your family, but we only found about 12 songs to choose from. I actually had to declare some of the songs off-limits to my kids because they are terrible (lyrics/message, etc.). This is not nearly as family friendly as Band Hero. I think this game was intended for the college dudes to play in the dorms. I'm glad I found this in the bargain bin, otherwise I would be even more disappointed."
4,Kids Love It,My kids have been wearing out the Guitar. They love the game and have been looking forward to the Aerosmith version. My only negative is the wish for more songs. Great product overall.
5,awesome,"this game is awesome! i dont know about the other reviews because to me youre not supposed to be looking at the graphics youre playing to here the music and the other people need to plainly GROW UP! yeah it does have not fully dressed girls but again i say youre supposed to be playing the music and not looking for what the girls have on because if you are, you just wasted a lot of money pal."
5,Amazing!,"I absolutely love my guitar hero game.I play it just about all the time.Nothing was broken, and it didn't take long for delivery either.This game is fun. Especially when you have friends over."
4,Legends of rock,"while i have enjoyed all of the GH Series and this was is awesome addition being for the Wii, since i only have ps2 and a Wii the standard wireless controls kick butt. how ever i feel a lot of the bonus songs are kind of lame, but other then that its just good times."
4,PICK IT!,"This is a great game for folks of all ages. I would definately recommend if you are looking for a challenging game which uses hand-eye coordination (a good ear helps as well). Only downfall I would say is for youngsters, it can be a bit overwhelming with the graphics."
4,Rock On,"I bought this as a gift for my brother. I noticed that whenever we went into the store he always drifted over that way. Well he of course loved it, but what really surprised me is how much I liked it. I am not the most coordinated person in the world but I found myself trying to strum along to some old rock classics."
4,Look Ma' I'm a RockStar...,"I became a fan of GH when I first played it at my friends house during my senior year of HS. When I first found out it was coming out for the Wii I was so excited. I think the game is great and is enjoyable to all ages. My sisters and I even got my mom to try to play, even though she wasn't that great she still had fun trying. But the only thing that I wish they would have done was allowed the Wii platform to buy/dl music like how the PS3 and XBox360 does. I don't understand why they didn't set it up that way, if you can go online to battle other people why can't we go online to dl more songs. Now I'm super excited for GH World Tour to come out, can't wait!"
2,Can't get past the first five or so songs?,"Is there more to this game than the original five or so songs? We can't seem to figure out how to get more songs available to play. Other than that, it is as expected."
2,Not all that great...,"I was pretty disappointed with this wii product. We ordered it for the whole family to enjoy, but clearly, the kids (under 7) could not maneuver the guitar. My kids are very musical and just could not play this game. The biggest problem was that, initially, you only have access to about five songs. The product info says something like 45 songs...no way. My friend says that you have to play ALL five songs well enough to pass and then you get access to more songs, but, do I have to do that every time I want to play a different song? There was nothing in the instructions about accessing all the songs. I don't want to jump through hoops when I play a game, this was not worth it for our family to keep. If the product description were better I would have bought something different right off the bat and not wasted anybody's time."
3,Great Game but Horrible Sound on Wii,"The gameplay is similar to previous Guitar Hero's. They've added a ""Battle"" mode which you either love or hate.. I personally could do without it. The online play is awesome since it's always an adrenaline rush playing complete strangers. It can be very rewarding or humbling depending on how good you are. Having the botched notes come from your wii-mote is a nice touch too.The one major category this game fails to shine is in the sound. It's not in the advertised ""Dolby Pro Logic II"" that's stamped on the box nor is it in Stereo. WHO MAKES A GAME BASED ON MUSIC IN MONO!?!?! Deploying your star power makes the game sound very muffled.I would give this game 5 stars but I have to give it 3 for the awful sound."
3,Defective product... Pro Logic II audio is only in mono,"I was very excited to receive this game, and I couldn't wait to ""rock-out"" in Dolby Pro Logic II as advertised on the back of the game's box! However, I was quickly disappointed to find out that the game's Dolby Pro Logic II only routes mono audio to the center channel. I have found this to be a widely reported defect of the Wii version of the game, so beware!"
5,What I now know,"I first played GHIII on the playstation 2 before purchasing the game for the wii. When I first started playing on the wii, I became very frustrated and annoyed. I thought the timing was screwed up. I went through and tried to calibrate the guitar, but nothing seemed to work. I was almost ready to give up on the game and declare it a loss, but while playing on easy, I realized that I was actually just strumming too hard. On the PS2 guitar, I could bang down pretty hard on the strum bar without issue, but I found that on the wii guitar, I was getting some kick back and it was registering a second strum. Consequently, I had trouble with the long notes and I couldn't keep a streak to save my life. It took a few hours of playing to re-train myself, but it was worth it and I now enjoy the game as much as ever.Also, I have to tilt the guitar up a lot higher than on the PS2 in order to activate star power."
4,"Very Challenging!! Fun party game, kids LOVE it!","My kids love this game, they have gotten really good at playing it and you get more difficult bonus songs if you are REALLY good. I stink and haven't made it past my first EASY song. We have friends over to play it and so do our kids. It is a really fun group game, however, we need another guitar to have battles and guitars only are not sold in stores. If I was in charge of making this game the only thing I would change would be availability of guitars only so you can have battles."
5,Wonderful gift,"I got this for my girls for Christmas, and they love it. They play with it more than any of their other games. Highly recommend this!"
5,Awesome Deal ! Worth the $$$,"Glad I bought this. It was a great deal [...] for the whole family. The wireless guitar is much easier and the variety of songs, rock !!"
3,Legends of Rock purchase,"I can't really review it as its still wrapped and waiting for little fingers to open on Christmas morning; however, the speed with which it arrived was terrific and appeared to be totally okay (overwrapped with shrinkwrap and tape - very secure."
4,"Great game, great product","Really enjoyed this game. However I bought it after GH4, World Tour, so I noticed the subtle differences. I find the song list on GH4 is a little better. The guitar for this game does not have a star power button and when you tilt the guitar up for star power it doesn't register unless you are extremely exaggerated with that movement. It may be because this guitar is smaller than the guitar for GH4. Otherwise, the game arrived on time, in excellent condition, and has some great songs."
4,Stay-at-home mom loves to rock!,"I'm a 33 yr old stay-at-home mom of two young kids. I am in mommy mode most of the day, which (at times) can be dull. But I love rock music. I've always imagined myself laying down a killer guitar riff, but I have no idea how to play guitar, much less have time to ""rock out"" (as my kids put it).My husband recently went nuts and brought home a Wii. It was cool and all, but we don't have many games. Then the other night he went nuts again and surprised us all with Guitar Hero III. We had so much fun playing, that the following night, he went out and bought another guitar just so we could face off. Ok, so we haven't yet mastered more than the green, red, and yellow notes.. but we're kicking ""easy's"" butt!The music is fun, and it's super cool that you can earn money to buy extra songs, outfits, videos, etc.. I love it! And you totally have to link your account to GuitarHero.com, so you can get groupies and compare your stats with your friends'. It's SO fun!"
5,feeling like a rock star,"This is so awesome ,we started doing wii parties awhile ago & this has become a big hit."
3,guitar hero 3-fun for a variety of players!,Guitar hero III is lots of fun and my whole family enjoys it. My only complaint is the rather limited selection of music that's included.
3,Guitar Hero: Fun but over Hyped,"Not a lot to the game really....it's fun, but there aren't that many stages to it so it's over quickly! I wouldn't pay above retail for it. (And am happy to say I didn't)"
1,Great Product - Wrong Price,"For this price, the ""bundle"" should be 2 of them! Shop around and buy for $90."
4,"Same game, different songs.","When I received the Guitar hero bundle I was anxious to see how the gameplay may have been enhanced or updated. While the graphics and game art are all beautiful - the gameplay was exactly the same as the previous titles (with the exception of online play).I think that anyone that is looking for good solid fun can't go wrong here - the soundtrack is excellent although It would have been nice to see some classics such as ACDC, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix or Prince. But with the availability to download songs this title is totally open for expansion!The Guitar that comes with it is unfortunately not Bluetooth, which is the only disappointment for me.A must buy for any gamer, especially those who have the SLIGHTEST interest in the series."
2,get the real thing,"If your just looking to kick back and push colored buttons while a song plays in the background, then this is for you, but don't be impressed with yourself like you learned to play the real thing. Otherwise, if you want real reward, learn to play the song on a real guitar. A harmony guitar and a small amp will cost you maybe thirty to sixty bucks more. Guitar Hero would interest me if it had six buttons on each fret, and the buttons were relevant to the songs, it would be hard, but they could have lessons that baby-stepped you up to unlocking the songs, that would be a good idea. Nothing as rewarding as being able to play the real thing, especially when you get into coming up with your own music. Then your a real guitar hero, not someone fast at matching colored buttons to colors on a screen that have no relevence to the song what so ever."
2,Guitar Hero Bundle,"Bought this for my 14 year old son. He played it for a couple weeks and hasn't done much with it since; he rather spend his time playing internet games. I am, therefore, placing the rating low."
2,Guitar zero,"It's ok to see the kiddies playing with this, but full grown twenty somethings it's just sad, I mean, how many frustrated musicians are there in this country??!?!"
4,"Great game, hope it works with Rockband","I borrowed this game from a friend and had to get my own copy. Much more challenging than the same levels on Rockband, but would be nice to have the optional drums and singing. Rumored that it won't be compatible with Rockband so I'm not sure I'm willing to invest in either down the road until the compatibility issues get resolved. Still rocks."
2,just another case,"Seriously, look elsewhere for cheaper shipping.It's an ok product, nothing special.the color isnt as described either."
1,12'' version too big,"12'' version is too big for my thinkpad X61. I guess if it was tighter, it would be more protective."
4,Laptop notebook sleeve,"This is really all you can expect from a sleeve. Shipping was very quick, I am fully satisfied"
2,poor zipper,"The sleeve fits very snug on oddly shaped laptops, i.e. non-Apple laptops. This wouldn't be a problem if the zipper wasn't so poor. The zipper frequently separates from the zipper teeth, and is *very* difficult to get where it is zipping correctly.My advice is to pay the extra $5-$10 for a sleeve that doesn't annoyingly pop open because of a poor quality zipper."
3,Ok,Product as advertised. I have a relatively small lenovo laptop. The case is a bit big but it serves its function. I would have like more variety in color.
4,Halinka is a gift that not everyone will appriciate.,"Halinka is a unique book about a girl who lives in a foster home in post WWII Germany. The twelve year old protagonist has a sensitive spirit, despite the many protective walls that have helped her survive a difficult childhood. We see how this cleaver girl manages to take care of her own needs, find hope where looks for it, and takes some huge risks to get what she wants. Most importantly, we see in detail the peeling away of Halinka's defenses, and the opening up of her heart. This is a fasinating book. The character development is subtle and very real. The inner-life of Halinka is vivid with emotion and the details of a pre-adolecent faced with many personal challenges. I recommend this book to all thoughtful and sensitive readers over age 12."
3,.,"good, but 4th movie (Money talks) PAUSES and skips.. like it is scratched but its not scratched/dirty. its new. :("
4,Love the Chan and Tucker combo,"I know the ""buddy cop"" film has been done to death but Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker breathe new life into it with this series. I have to admit that they lose steam by the 3rd go-around but still some very funny moments in that film. Of course, you cannot go wrong with the 1st installment and in the 2nd you have to love the cameo by Don Cheadle. Great stuff"
4,Great Collection,[90/100] Rush Hour[80/100] Rush Hour 2[85/100] Rush Hour 3[70/100] Money TalksAverage rating (Rush Hour films): 85/BAverage rating (all four films): 81/C
3,4 film favorite,thank you a lot it's good but some of them it's suspended no problem bye see you soon have good day again thinks
4,great value DVD,"This DVD is a great way to get caught up on all the ""Rush Hour"" movies, the last movie ""Money Talks"" was a nice bonus for me. Value, is what this DVD is, a low price on a great collection.I hope the will continue to put movie collections in a pkg like this."
2,Poor disk quality.,"I used to think double sided discs were a good buy. These discs seem to play fine in spots, but skip in exactly the same spot every time no matter what DVD player I use. Good movies, bad disc quality."
3,I miss the language editing for TV,"Although I don't like foul language at all, I am very offended by the cursing that references our Savior. I didn't realize there was so much of it because it is edited out when watching these on network TV. I so enjoy the action and comedy between the two characters. Too bad it is ruined by the cursing. I only got through Rush Hour, and that with great difficulty."
3,it is small,"it works okay for a recorder but it is smaller than i thought it would be but it works okay not the best but as for recorders it is average, and that includes the hard to get the right sound out of it from the start... its average and okay not the best but i am no expert on the subject... but if you need one this is okay."
3,You get what you pay for.,"As the title suggests, you get what you pay for. The construction is good quality plastic but the sound is fairly terrible. It is very difficult to create any sounds that are not too screechy and inconsistent. I bought it because it was the right price for a toy for my 2 year-old. He loves it. Just don't buy it if you are actually looking to make music instead of noise."
5,Perfect recorder,"I ordered this recorder for my 4th-grader, who wanted to be able to practice her recorder at home. It's perfect, and a very nice-looking little thing. Much prettier than the one I had when I was her age! And the price can't be beat!"
5,Perfect for little kids,"My 2 yo son tried out a recorder at a friend's house and after that kept pretending he was playing his toys as musical recorders so I ordered one for him too, pronto. He loves it. He's thrilled. I'm happy it seems solid and good quality and made of all one pieced which is very important for young children who take things apart and lose things."
4,Well made inexpensive recorder,"I bought this recorder for my niece and nephews to help them learn music.So far so good, except my niece managed to break part of the bottom off.I think they were recorder-fighting so this is probably not a flaw in the make. I especially like it because it is one piece. I had the feeling things like recorder fighting and misuse would happen (they are 5 and 6) so I wanted something sturdy and in one piece. The recorders that come apart would get lost if you are purchasing for younger ages unless they are more responsible children. The only downside is the color. It is a little harder to see the holes when trying to show them proper placement. The pitch is legitimate so far (it has been about 5 months since my first purchase of it), and they play well together."
4,Cute Toy Box!,The box is very cute. Not too much problem putting it together (had a little trouble but worked through it). Not a huge toy box but perfect for what I wanted it for. I filled it with dress up clothes. Very cute as a bench. Even though it has a Safety hinge and a cutout beneath the lid my little one had her fingers where the cut out was not as her sister sat on the cushion top and it did smash her fingers. Still and all a nice toy box.
5,Toy Box,"Loved it. It was for my granddaughter. It is sturdy, the paint is non chipping, and the cushion plush. The lid can't slam and hurt fingers. Very nice for the money."
2,Maybe they get better...,"I wanted to look like this book. I'd heard the series was like the show Supernatural. Not so much. I stuck with it, to find out the outcome and see if it got better, but was disappointed. Not enough background, slow plot, characters that aren't fully formed or likeable. I wish it was a series I could follow, but after this, I think it would be a waste of time and money."
3,Decent -- Believe this Author will Impove Over Time,"This was a decent read. However, while I believe that this author will improve over time, this is not a 4 or 5 star book. It's an OK book that is a bit uneven at times. Give it a go but don't expect it to live up to a 5 star rating."
1,Most Boring Book Ever Written?,"I'll admit I gave up after the first 100 pages, but geez, NOTHING happens. Lots of descriptions of what they eat (who cares!) and of his brother's hair. I mean, Cal's obsession with his brother's hair made me think we were going to be tipping over into M/M incest any second (and I can't for the life of me imagine what purpose said obsession served to the story, but maybe it was REALLY important later in the book).Stinker. Glad I got my money back."
2,reveiw,"i am a fan of paranormal fantasy and this book is not really bad but neither is a good onethe characters etc have no real depth, the story has many floundering also if it is quite funny"
2,A chore to get through,"I picked up this book for some light reading. After checking the reviews, I figured I'd give it a chance.But I just didn't like this book.The main character Cal is bratty and annoying and then mid book his character switch is so out of the blue.The rest of the few characters are 2 dimensional and wooden. Goodfellow was the only one I sorta warmed up to.The story is cliched and boring. Which in and of itself is usually ok with me. I enjoy reading '*Popcorn' books. (*As in light and airy, with not much substance, but delicious all the same.)There was nothing I could really get into or like about this book. Maybe it's good for you, but not me.Simply put, it was boring and unenjoyable."
2,I didn't enjoy it.,"Set in modern day with a sprinkling of different mythical/fantastic creatures, this story takes on the situation of a boy born from a human and demon cross. Exactly why this has happened and what the consequences will be consumes the majority of the story.The main character is a cynical, self-absorbed, boring twit. I didn't like him and his older brother is so noble and self-righteous that he is not beleivable. The idea for the story is fine, but I didn't like any of the characters, so basically I didn't like the book.Ultimately I didn't enjoy the book because I need a character that I can identify with or at least sympathize with and the author gave me nothing to work with. It just wasn't up to the standards that I have come to critique this genre against."
3,Good but not great,"The concept for this series is very good. Caliban and Niko are brothers. Cal is born half monster, half human - and the monster half wants him back. The brothers are on the run and are battling the supernatural.The author is very good - but has one annoying 'habit' - when describing something, or when making a point - he says the same thing in three different ways.It's hard to explain - but it caused me to continually skim to get past the current explanation. It's not that the sentences aren't written well - they are very descriptive - but he is just repetitive and does it ALL through the book - it got annoying - but not so bad as to not want to read the book.If it hadn't been for that I would have rated the book 4 stars. The other books in the series are a little better at NOT doing this.If you like urban fantasy you should enjoy this book/series. There isn't a lot of blatant sex - but the violence is described in gory detail - so be aware of that."
2,Not sure I can go on....,"I'm at page 66 and I don't know if I can keep reading. This book is like trying to walk through quicksand, endless plodding through Cal's ""I'm a monster"" talk, the needless obscure references and metaphors, Nikos 'stick up the a$$ attitude, and the awful dialogue and run together sentences. This book is immature fantasy at it's best.The sentences were needlessly complicated and unnecessarily 'sassy', every second word seemed like some wise a$$ remark. The sword wielding, straight laced older brother was just to much, this book was one walking cliche after another. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who notice the ""Supernatural"" parallels.I'll try to read the rest but I've had it for over a week now and can barely stand NOT to put it down."
5,Great first novel by an author to watch out for!,"Cal's a half-demon child who is trying to unravel his past with the help of his brother and Robin Goodfellow. He's spent some time in Auphe and suffers amnesia and nightmares from the experience. Worse, the denizens of that place are after him.This is a well-written first book and one world I'd like to see more of. Thurman doesn't turn this into an excuse for erotica. She doesn't need to reach for sex to keep her readers interested. All in all, a really good read from an author I would love to hear more from."
3,Hang in there,"I was about to give up on this book about half way through it. OK, I get it that the protagonist's father was not human and that he fears he is a monster (he is called Caliburn, after all.) I also get it that he is protected by his devoted (human) elder half-brother - a figure that is too good to be true - I mean, devoted, loyal, martial arts paragon etc etc. but that really isn't enough. There are tantalizing references to supernatural fights/exploits but they aren't well fleshed out. (The same could be said of the characters). However, the book does improve. There is much more action in the last third of the book and the addition of an intriguing couple of characters does help. The characterization remains weak and the plot doesn't really bear too much scrutiny but I was sufficiently engaged to order the next in the series."
4,Loved it,"I love how much the brothers are devoted to each other, the deep unconditional brotherly love between the two make this book different from other books that I've read. Cal has a smart mouth but Nicko is his backbone! I like the fact that Cal can fend for himself but still needs his big brother. Like any books there are some love interest, but the relationship between the two brothers is what so wonderful!"
3,Not my Cup of Tea,"I found the story tedious and lacking in substance on this point. There was a two year period where our hero is taken through to another dimension. He is returned. Remembers nothing. He is followed by the creatures from this dimension because he is sired by one of them.His brother and him are always running away from these creatures who want him. After a while I found it tedious. Perhaps he could have remembered something of his two years in another dimension to add interest.It was tiresome to read about that he didn't remember. Even when he would see these creatures.There was even a sentence that said he killed his father but didn't remember.C'mon. It's a book. We need some details. I needed for him to remember something. To have some hidden power other than a keen sense of smell.It was good writing, but not enough story for me."
3,Dark Nightlife,"I really wanted to like this book. I just got finished reading the Dreaden File books, and was looking for a new fix. A friend, the same friend who had recommended the Dresden books, told me about this book, and I was anxious to check it out. This book was way darker than even the Dresden books, and I really hated that the second half of the story was actually from the point of view of the bad guy. It is very well written, and some may really like the unusual point of view presented. I bought the second book, and will read it, also - eventually. This story is such a downer, though, that I think I'll wait before taking this particular dark path again."
3,More like Buffy's Nightlife...,"I was really looking forward to reading an all-new writer in what seemed like a Underworld-type novel.But covers and backs of covers can be decieving.This read more cutesy and cuddly, like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Being a more mature, older type, those TV shows - and now books - are not my cup of tea. Give me a more hardcore type Vampire novel, the likes of Necroscope and such anyday.But in all fairness, if this is your type of book, and you are one of the many who seem to have liked Buffy, then this is for you.Rob Thurman is a good enough writer. Unfortunately, he just writes in a more teen-like style approach that is not for this forty-something, beer drinkin', cigar smoking, red-blooded male."
3,Faber-Castell complete drawing and sketching set,"I purchased this set for my sixteen year old grandson. I think the quality of materials were good, although scant in number. The case was a great disappointment for the amount of money spent of $29.95. I found a similar set made by Faber-Castell on another website for $14.95. I purchased yet another drawing Faber-Castell set from Dick Blick web sit for $29.95, and it came with a very nice brief case style case, with multi compartments, and very sturdy. Although this one was set up for a younger user the case could have been used for both of these kits."
4,"Once a hero, always at war...","Scott's THRAXAS AT WAR joins others in the series to also blend fantasy with humor and a tough of PI irony. Here the seedy, broke Thraxas faces a city in trouble whn the Orcs attack under a new leader's rule. He was a hero in the last war but he wants no part of this one - until his investigation at the war ministry involves him anyway."
2,Boelcke deserved much better,"The backbone of the book are the letters from Boelcke to his family. However, Cap. Boelcke was writing to his parents, not to general public interested in WWI aviation. So, the writer should be expected to provide a reasonable amount of contextualization. But Mr. Werner had no interest in performing any serious research. His preference was for shameless propaganda. For instance, he will teach you that Oswald Boelcke had the luck of being born in a true German family. The flattery is so exaggerated that portraits that outstanding man in a kind of Mickey Mouse perfection, removing from him any trace of humanity. Four Stars to the letters from Oswald Boelcke, zero to the Johannes Werner's text, making the 2 stars average this book deserves."
3,Sketchy memories,"As a fan of Bogart movies,I found this to be an interesting read, even though it is really a collection of Bogart stories, told by his old friends. Humphrey Bogart died when his son was only 8 years old and his memories of his father are as sketchy as one would expect. What annoyed me was his whining attitude towards his father for dying and leaving him (as if he could help this !) and towards his mother, for her love and loyalty to her husband. This was a much loved and cherished child who blamed all of his failings in life on the fact that he was left fatherless as a child, but enjoyed a loving home and what would have been a fine education if he had applied himself and stopped drowning in self pity."
2,a tiring search,"Well written but hardly engaging, Stephen Bogart descends to the predictable far too often. Open any section and the recipe will be identical: Fascinating anecdotes about Humphrey Bogart & mid-century Hollywood are sandwiched between massive slabs of ""oh my daddy died and thats why life has been so hard for me me me!"" The mantra of selfpity continues throughout. For those who blame their parents for the crippling hardship of adulthood (!) this is the book for you. Bogart fans will perhaps be less pleased - 2 stars for fluid prose & the bits which actually deal with Bogie, icon & man"
3,STEPHEN:LOST AND CONFUSED,"As I read the other reviews I looked back to see if we wererating the same book. Unlike one of the other reviewers, I DOlike biographies and as an avid reader ,have read many...20 last month. This book is 2-1/2 stars at most..Certainly not a ""five"".Stephen Bogart allowed himself to become cynical, tortured and lost, with a chip on his shoulder the size of Idaho.I'm sorry he had such a short relationship with his father, but it isn't too late for him to have a true relationship with hisFather. Without Him , Stephen will have everlasting, unending problems !As long as his heart is beating, it's not too late, but when it stops, it's irreversible and set forever!"
4,Good Product - But Shipping Charge Stretches Belief,"I bought the ""heavy"" version of this product mainly to help rehab my shoulder after arthroscopic surgery. It's a great product as far as it goes; but if you have any muscularity, you definitely want to go with the extra heavy. There are no ""instructions"" with the product, so an inventive imagination is a must on ways to use it other than bicep curls and upright rows.The biggest drawback is the shipping charge. At only cents less than the product itself, I thought it was a bit sporty. I guess when you factor in gas, time, sales tax and inconvenience, it's worth it."
2,Mostly for Show,"Top Trumps were originally made in Britain back in the 70's for things like cars, planes, superheroes etc. Hasbro bought the rights and used 6 themes: Simpsons; Lord of the Rings; Star Wars; dinosaurs; fighter jets and predators.Each cards has around 6 differents stats. Each player gets a stack of cards. The first player picks a stat and whoever has the highest stat in that category wins all the cards as in the game War.Not much of game but the cards are amusing.You can get one pack of cards at ToysRUs. Inside is a coupon that gives you 2-for-1 for an unlimited number of more Top Trumps. So, buy one at regular price and use the coupon for the rest."
2,"Fluffy, unproofread, 30% glossary.",Did someone forget to proofread this? Are all of NYIF's books this shoddy?Better would be:The Motley Fool Investment GuideA Random Walk Down Wall StreetBeating the DowLearn to Earn
3,A fairly good over view for me,"I am just beginning to learn about the stock market, and all the other dimensions that go along with it. I found this book quite informative, I have read it two times now. I use this as a text book to study from. I am also reading other books on the subject to make sure the information I learn is correct."
3,"Good table of contents, mediocre book","While this may be a reasonable introduction to the basics of the market and its terminology, it is undermined by truly horrendous editing. Typographic mistakes abound. I hope the editor is more careful with his money than he is with his words."
1,Dangerously Inaccurate,"Prentice-Hall is notorious for sloppy textbooks, and this book is in the company tradition. The text was not edited, proofread, or fact-checked. The glossary entry for wash sales is egregious, but almost any page provides examples. All information in this book is therefore suspect."
2,ok but expensive compared to Walmart,"Saw it at $7 at OSH so ordered from Amazon but then saw it at Walmart for $1.60 with a better handle (grip).Seems solid but the screw does not hold very tight so you'll find yourself doing a lot of adjusting when using, not very handy."
4,If its from Cornzapoppin then its going to be great.,"It does not matter which kind you order from Cornzapoppin, its going to be great!"
4,Great clips,"These clips do the work but if you're doing snatches, cleans, etc and drop the weight -- the black rubber covers tend to fall off. Other than that, it works great!"
5,What I wanted!!!,The product was the correct size no problems at all. Purchased same type of clamps before and just as good as the previous.
5,Spring Weight Clamps,They work great. I thought they were a little stiff at first when I got them. After one day of using them they loosened up. The clamps squeeze the end of the bars well and snug up against the weights. I've been using them for over a week now and had no issues with weights sliding. Great for the money.
4,cap olympic clips,"it holds the weight on the bar. there are nicer clips, and there are clips that don't work. these work."
3,"Cheap, won't last","They fit, but judging by the way they compress they are going to wear down pretty fast. You get what you pay for. For those complaining about the grip strength required to compress them - if your grip is too weak for it then you REALLY need to work on your forearm/grip or that is going to be the limiting factor in your workout anyways. Consider it a good opportunity to train your grip!"
4,good collars,I marked it 4 stars because they are little bit big. I can use them fine but I prefer my other collars.They do hold on tightly.
4,Strong clips,"These get the job done. Ignore the comments are being hard to squeeze, that is what you want in a clip that holds a lot of weight...too easy to put on, too easy to come off. Nothing fancy here, just pure function"
4,Good inexpensive spring clamps,"Have read a number of reviews regarding the angle of the grips and the strength required to open the spring, as well as the fit on different sized olympic (2"") bars. I purchased two sets of these clamps and have used them on two different Olympic bars and on dumbbells. The clamps are stiff to open, but not as tough as some I've used. Both sets fit the different bars perfectly. I have another set of chromed spring clamps that fit well on one barbell, but are too tight and difficult to slide on the other. With these spring clamps, they fit both just fine, without slippage. I'd recommend these to others."
2,They don't fit very well,"I was a little disappointed with these collars. They're very tight and somewhat difficult to squeeze. Once I squeeze them, they're still very tight and hard in attach onto the barbell."
3,"They clip, they spring","They prevent my plates from wobbling away from each other on the bar. They are easily closed with one hand, but I do have bigger hands. Sometimes the rubber handles will slip down the clip a bit, but they snug back up fine. I have not attempted to find out their holding power by loading plates up and standing the bar on its end, but my guess is that you want a different clamp if that's your use case. They can be knocked out of a tight position if you rack the bar fairly forcefully, but we're talking maybe a few MM. For ten bucks or so, you get what you pay for here."
4,How to Ask and Get,"In this excellent short handbook, the prolific author Stephan Schiffman, widely recognized for his sales expertise, outlines his selling approach, which relies more on asking and listening than on pressuring a prospect toward a close. Schiffman says it's time to break with traditional sales techniques. He provides a host of questions that a good salesperson should always ask, and warns you about which questions you should never ask. If you are tired of sales guides that rehash the same old song-and-dance about finding problem points and pain, and convincing the prospect to adopt your solution, we recommend this book for a refreshing change."
5,Excellent and obscure... so get it while you can.,"A project let by 'Javier Campos Martinez', orignally recorded in 1997 at the ICAIC studios in La Habana, Cuba. But released on the small 'Pan' label in 1999.Featuring the late great master 'PANCHO QUINTO' (the late 'Long John Olivas' father) on Bata, Quinto and Cajon, along with MARTHA GALARRAGA on vocals (Lazaro Galarragas daughter), 'ERNESTO ""EL GATO"" GATEL' on vocals (singer with 'Clave Y Guaguanco'), 'MAXIMO ""EL MORO QUINTO"" DUQUESNE' on Quinto, Cajon, Tumba (from 'Rumberos De Cuba').The drumming and singing is right on the money by all of these Havana masters.An obscure and EXCELLENT recording session, so buy while you can."
4,useful and easy to install,"useful and easy to install, I put it outside my music studio dooruseful and easy to install, I put it outside my music studio door"
5,Love It,"The first one I ordered never arrived -- I was so disappointed, but when I emailed Amazon they shipped it again and I had it in a few days.This is the best gaminig program I have ever had. I downloaded it from Pogo, but changed computers which is why I wanted a CD. I earn tokens for POGO by playing the games on the CD.On a loosing trip from Vegas, the game was a hit with my girlfriends who were considerably ""lighter-of-pocket"" than when we went. You are always going forward, not reverse."
5,IT'S THE CARRIBEAN CASINO WITH THIS GAME,"A GREAT GAME AND ENTERTAINING IF YOU GAMBLE ON LOW LEVELS, VACATIONS ONLY, ETC. I JUST LOVED IT."
4,Worth a read...,"This is a readable, interesting, intelligent book on spying and spycraft. The other reviews describe the book well.My only issue with it is that it is brief, more like a novella or a long short story than a novel. It lacks density and texture. It's best to read on a coast-to-coast flight. It makes sense that the author has movie and television experience."
3,Sizes Seem to Run Small,Check you shoe size before ordering these ... I usually wear a size 9 1/2 to 10 and so ordered a size 10.The sandals fit tight and feel more like a size 9 than a size 10.
2,Fail,This book is very repetitive. Could have been shorted to a long article in my opinion. But with a lack of good quality hockey books it still might be worth your time. I had higher expectations when I ordered it and it let me down but if you are interested in the sport and don't know much it I do not want to discourage you form learning so it might be worth your time and teach you about the culture of hockey.
3,Not bad,"Not bad at all. I found it rather repetitious, however. The book could be about half as long and still give an accurate and interestingaccount of the inner workings of the NHL's ""code of justice"". Quite a few good quotes/anecdotes from some of the game's best enforcers. Worth a read I think."
1,This Book Could Have Been A Pamphlet,"Although I've always been a huge hockey fan, and always will be, ""The Code"" left me wondering why it used so much paper. Although I commend the author for tackling the subject, ""The Code"" is too often repetitive in his overused phrases such as ""an arena with 20,000 fans behind you"", ""if he shows up"", and other archaic sayings. Although I enjoy a good spat settled in fisticuff,s ""The Code"" is rather drab. It would have been great to see more photos of the action and hear from more of the referees, coaches past and present, and the finesse players who depend on the enforcers protection. I am male, in my early fifties and played hockey when I was younger (nowhere near professional ability), but found the book a little too high on the testosterone level."
3,Fighters on Fighters,"I agree with another reviewer that this book is too repetitive. Its basically a repeated discussion by fighters of why fighting should remain in the game. The author should have had more points of view, such as those by Lou Nanne and Neal Sheahy, coaches and aggitators, that he did include. These two brought out different views on the pro and anti fighting debate. I'm 42 years old and have played hockey my entire life. I love the Flyers and the Broad Street Bullies. But this book got me thinking that fighting is still in the game just for the spectacle of it, and not as part of a true code. It appears the code is anything a hockey player wants to make of it and that is not a true code."
4,Interesting Treatise on a Timely Topic,"Few aspects of the recently-concluded elections have been more examined than the roles of race and immigration in America. This book by the eminent professor Viggo Hansen adds an interesting perspective to the national discussion.Although written about Northern European immigrants of an earlier generation, ""Boundary"" superbly illustrates the sometimes-humorous, often-touching and frequently-dramatic clash of cultures and expectations experienced by all participating in the Great American experiment of immigration. And as America continues its perpetual metamorphosis into ""something new"", the introspection encouraged by those such as Hansen will help define and clarify the changes' direction."
2,Is Boring ya,"The author has some good knowledge to share, but he's clearly not a professional writer and does not know how to captivate a reading audience. My attention kept wavering (until he finally told a good story) so his points were unfortunately lost to me, and I only got around to finishing half the book."
5,Makes life easier on my clients,"I run a mild hyperbaric therapy clinic in Washington State (New Leaf Hyperbarics). Going into a chamber and being put under pressure can be a challenge for some patients, until I started offering these Earplanes. Clients with injuries to their skull and/or ears who previously had to keep the pressure lower than normal can now be treated at full pressure. I highly recommend this item for adults and children alike!"
5,Above Excellence,"WOW!!! I suffered with ear problems on long flights but after using EARPLANES on my flight to London from the Caribbean recently, I must say that it certainly made my travel much more comfortable, especially at the descent of the air plane. Excellent product indeed!!!!"
4,Useful,Useful if you need to do organization research or you are doing a project. Wouldn't spend too much on this though as it was of limited value to me once I finished
1,More Junk...,I thought I would give this book a try as I am trying to get more organized for the new year.Basically I thought the book was condescending and very misleading..I am frazzled and left very confused by the direction or should I say misdirection this book has left me.In fact it was a total waste of time and actually added to the clutter that I am getting rid of... Signed Dazed and Confused
1,Strange vibrations,"What songs are included in this collection? Remember, I was drafted in 1970. Everything in that era is not automatically great."
2,Good candy but a small bag = LARGE Rip off,"I love the Haribo Berries, but really expected a lot more for my $6.49. My order (one bag) just arrived and I was VERY disappointed to find that the contents of this little bag will barely fill a small candy dish. I guess it's my fault for overestimating the quantity of what I was buying; I expected more. For once, it looks like Amazon may NOT be the best place to buy this item."
1,gross,This was a bad purchase. This product tastes like way too sweet chemical hell!It's awful and I will never purchase it again or any Haribo product!
4,fine live document of a great band,"They never seem to tour the states, so this is as close as many of us will ever get to a Stanglers show. I had the thrill of seeing JJ tour with Smithereens' frontman Pat Dinizio. The enthusiasm and great bass playing he displayed that night are also a major part of the sound of this live CD. Paul Roberts is a fine lead singer. Baz Warne seems to have capably filled John Ellis' shoes. The band sounds energized. The performances are are faithful. The only reason I don't give this five stars is because there is ample room on the two discs for more Stranglers classics. TIME TO DIE, WALK ON BY, and many other great songs could have been performed to make this a truly incredible value. As it is, this disc proves there's quite a bit of life left in the Stranglers."
1,I don't believe it,"As a huge Stranglers fan - at least of their first 2 studio albums - (I was living in the UK when they were first issued)- I decided on a whim to buy this since I was unfamiliar with it, the cover said it included their best live performances, and the cuts were the right ones. Much to my dismay, when I opened it, I read ""The Stranglers are..."" and it listed only 3 members of the original band. I had never heard of two of the people listed. Hugh Cornwell's name was absent. How can you have The Stranglers without Hugh Cornwell? They tried it at least once before, on their live ""Stranglers and Friends"" album, and well, let's just say, that was not one of my favorites. Anyway, I was so disgusted that I trashed the CD without hearing it. I gave it one star because the review site would not let me leave that required field i.e. ""How do you rate this CD?"" blank."
3,A thorny story,"With the randomiser now removed, and he Doctor is repairing K9, when the TARDIS arrives in the Prion system. The Doctor decides to visit Tigella, a planet which he has visited before, and he and Romana talk about the lost civilisation on the neighbouring planet Zolfa-Thura. But Zolfa-Thura is not as dead as they believe...Something of a throwback to season seventeen, this story contains some sillier moments and is all a bit peculiar. Not a great story."
3,Hard to take the Jesus Seminar seriously anymore...,"The first half of the book is a transcript of a debate between Dr. Craig and Dr. Crossan moderated by William F. Buckley. The second half is reflections on the debate by Christian and Jesus Seminar scholars. The debate itself is bad, as even the Christian scholars admit in their reflections. Crossan is nuts. He doesn't answer Craig's arguments nor does he seem to understand what the debate is about. Crossan has this esoteric belief about the resurrection and the historical Jesus that doesn't fit into a nice dialog with Craig. This book has shown me that indeed, the Jesus Seminar is a bunch of out-there hacks."
3,"Not much of a ""debate""","Crossan's refusal to seriously challenge Craig, and his views like ""Did God exist in the times of the dinosaurs"" is meaningless make this ""debate"" have very little common ground for Craig and Crossan to discuss. Crossan fails to make any kind of case whatsover, much less a convincing one, and strikes me as someone who presupposes much of what he concludes.I would not recommend buying this book, but it does contain good responses by other scholars. This is one to borrow from a professor or a library, but not to own unless you have a very special reason."
1,A Real Non-Debate,"As an associate of the Jesus Seminar I was disappointed by this debate. The two spoke past each other.Craig was impressive in presenting what he believes to constitute evidence for the historicity of the Gospels. However, if Crossan is right and the Gospels were never intended to be historical documents but, rather, metaphorical prose, Craig's efforts are as useful as arguing for the historicity of the little boy who cried wolf. He does it well, but so what?Because this matter was not adequately addressed, this debate was little more than two impressive scholars ignoring each other and making interesting speeches."
4,love the scent,I love the smell of my kitchen after cleaning the countertops with the Lemon Verbena spray. Seems to do the job.
5,"Uplifting, inspiring","Martha Kate knows how to go to the heart of the matter. As we travel through this life, this delightful meanderings of her thoughts brings one back to the reality that ""grace"" is a free gift taken for granted by we Christians. She inspires us to reflect on our journey in life and the grace bestowed on us by God at various stops in our lives. This book was a short read but one I intend to read over and over and reflect on the thoughts and insights shared. I too have been prayed over for ""travelling grace"" and know the awesome power of that prayer."
3,So-so,"First, I've done a couple of the segments on the DVD, and they were both longer than 10 minutes (around 13 minutes or so) - not a huge deal, but why would they specifically name it ""10-minute Workouts?"" Second, the instructor is obviously very experienced and flexible, and doesn't offer many modifications for those of us who are not all that flexible. It seems that she just assumes everyone watching can keep up with her. Also, sometimes the video quality is not all that good."
2,Beware...Assembly flaws!!!,"I just assembled this trike and had serious troubles!!! The plastic piece that ""pops"" into the front wheel guard won't seat into the wheel guard because the weld on the steering column is uneven. The hole for the screw that attaches the step plate over the back wheels is not the correct size (too small)...so, I had to leave the step plate off. The bolt that holds the base for the adult push handle interferes with two of the four bolts that hold the seat on...so, you have limited choices for positioning the seat. Finally, the two bolts provided for the seat were too long for the cap nuts. To stablize the seat I had to buy additional washers to snug up the bolt!!! I'm very disappointed since I feel like we paid extra to buy a quality bike and therefore expected it to be easily assembled into a safe, quality product! It does seem sturdy despite the flaws, but, I'm seriously considering sending it back!"
4,Very durable trike,"We bought the Air Happy trike for my 2 yr old son this last Christmas. It arrived in plenty of time, but the whole box and everything wreaked of smoke. It took quite a while to air out the room we had it stashed in, but the trike was in fine shape. The instructions do leave something to be desired and they're written in German only. My husband still managed to assemble it in maybe 30 minutes. It's very sturdy and colorful and very nice quality. It's probably not the best starter trike though because it is really heavy and the free-wheeling feature means the pedals don't move when you push the trike. So I'm trying to teach my toddler by holding his feet to the pedals while pedaling with my hands and running backward. Otherwise the free-wheeling is really cool. It actually allows the trike to pedal backward instead of braking and I know he'll really enjoy it when he gets a little older."
4,Great construction,I bought this for one of my twin granddaughters who is two and half. The tricycle is very well constructed and very sturdy. The only thing I do not care for is that it is a bit hard to steer. I bought a radio flyer tricycle for my other granddaughter and it steers much easier but is not quite as well built and as adustable as this one. I would definitely recommend this tricycle as long as you don't expect to have to use the steering handle too much.
3,More accessible than the Christophany book,"I found Panikkar's 'Experience of God' a more accessible read than the Christophany treatise. I think maybe his writing is translated to a difficult reading vernacular...since he writes in Italian, or Spanish. However, he is a unique scholar of Abrahamic faith, having experienced God from many contexts. He maintains an academic objectivity which is possibly off-putting to 'soaked in Western Protestant oriented church people', but refreshing to seekers of wisdom, who can read such material without a slant."
4,More Than Icons,"I read this book as part of an assignment for a class on Christian Theology. I thought it would be dealing with physical icons, so I was a little surprised when there were not any. It a deeply moving book about how we experience ""God."" I have put that in quotations, because the author feels that even that word is limiting. Labels have a way of limiting our interaction with the Divinity and that is explored in this book. A great read and I will read it again for pleasure to absorb more of the insight."
2,Don't do it,"This is interesting and some what informative but not worth 49,39,29 or even $19.99. If you have a friend you can borrow it from or can find someone to buy it from for $10 it might be worth it. The program is extremely vague and is given with the detail of a free pamphlet someone left on your car windshield. Get any book from the library on real estate and it will give you more information than this program. Donald Trump is great but there are no trade secretes in here. Save your money."
4,Well worth the money,"I thought this information presented in a well thought out, precise manner. Becasue of this purchase, I intend to purchase other products form this source."
3,Basic Manual for using Systat,Clearly written with examples that lead you through basic descriptive statistics and anova. The book leaves you wanting more detail and explanation of this complex program.
1,Nice Scope doesn't work,This scope appeared to be well built for the air gun usage it was designed for. I could not get the scope to adjust for elevation though windage was dead on out of the box. It was not worth the trouble to send it back or pay $20 to Barska to get it fixed as the scope was $40. I just hold over the intended target and it works well enough for me. If your air gun is worth more than the $70 I paid then I would spend more to get a reliable scope and not take a chance with this one.
3,"Comfy, but small","I got these online as I liked their design, colours and the fact they are easy to put on slippers. They feel a bit too rough, though, and also, I am usual size 10 but these are a half a size too small for me so I cannot wear them comfortably and would need size 11. I gave them to my mum, who finds them perfect as her feet is a bit smaller then mine. I guess I could give them back and get a bigger size but I cannot be bothered."
4,Motor skills on steroids!!!,"I bought the Neurosmith cube for my youngest granddaughter. I was not prepared for the reaction she had and the consistency of interest she showed to the music and cube! She would stand next to it, pound the top and begin to dance. After a while she had her favorite songs, so I bought the Rock Around the Clock cartridge. Fantastic product which will be handed down to the now youngest granddaughter!"
4,"The toy is great, but the cartridge is fairly unnecessary","My daughter LOVES her Jumbo Music Block, but this is a review of the cartridge. First of all, the cartridge is NOT needed for the block to work. The block has its own built-in set of songs that relate to the shape of the object oriented on the top of the block - ""Triangle 1,2,3"" ""Square - find them everywhere"" etc.The cartridge just adds different music that has nothing to do with the orientation of the block. It is more for the parent who gets tired of the same song, not the kid.I also have to note that the seller of this item when I bought it was not Amazon, it was sold by some third party through Amazon. The item I received was without a box and appeared to be used, or at least a customer return. It worked fine, but I wasn't happy and they eventually gave me a refund."
1,Caution: Check your model,There was not enough information in the Music Block description. The model we purchased CANNOT USE CARTRIDGES! Consequently we wasted money buying two cartridges that are useless with the toy. We went back and looked at the description of the toy and it is not clear that some models use the add on cartridges and other do not.
3,recommended--guardedly,"This is a succinct and serviceable--even useful--introduction to pentatonic scales for the beginning guitarist--especially the beginning rock or jazz guitarist. Its form has its inherent limitations, of course, and only anhematonic (that is, ""major"" or ""minor"") pentatonic scales are included. The beginning guitarist might do well to start with this and then go on to PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns. (He should not be intimidated by the title.)"
4,Reference only,You cannot get much from the size of this booklet. It can be used as a reference but not that commplete to be a good reference. It has some pictures showing the 5 patterns and that's it. Anything extension(or variation version) to them are describe in words or note on the staffs- not even clear enough to understand. What an odd mix!
2,Don't waste your money,"Nice radio that worked well for over a year, though the weather alerts became a monster, no way to turn them off. After about a year it start going off every hour, on the hour, saying that it hadn't received an alert in 10 days. Since it has internal batteries and can't be turned off, the only way we could ""fix"" it was to bury it in a drawer until the batteries ran down.After six month in the drawer I pulled it out today, 2/20/2010, and put some batteries in it. Configured it and it looks like it's working correctly again.Configuring this thing is very cumbersome.If it does the every hour thing again, I'll probably put a hammer through it.Don't waste your money."
4,Great Musicians,"To see Steve Smith playing it's a gift, every time has something new.Dave Dicenso is a poet.That's enough for me"
4,EASEL- LOTS OF FUN,I HAVE ENJOYED THE EASEL BUT IT IS BUILT FOR ADULTS ONLY AND NEEDS TO BE TREATED GENTLE AND DOES NOT TAKE UP MUCH SPACE- EASY TO USE.
2,Not so good....,"The only reason I gave this product two stars is because of the oil color variety. Otherwise I would have just given it one star. The reason is because the colors are not labeled!! Sure, you can see from the color on the outside of the tube that it's ""blue"", but the consumer needs to know WHAT shade/hue of blue he or she is using. Is it Prussian Blue, Pthalo Blue, or just BLUE? How disappointing! :("
3,.Audio 360 performance review,"I have owned and used this headset for several days. My experience thus far is that it's more suited to gaming applications than voice; voice quality through the speakers is okay, a bit more bass than I'd prefer.Parties at the other end hear me very well.Construction is sturdy, esp the microphone boom. Earpads cover the entire ear comfortably, and the headband DOES adjust for different size heads---one just pulls on the bands to the appropriate degree. Music reproduction is a strength, particularly gaming soundtracks.While I would like crisper, more natural voice reception, for the money (under $30 shipped), I'd say one could proably do a lot worse.I'd go as high as 3.75 stars. Unfortunately, the only units I've read about that have unqualified endorsements from reviewers cost around $100, way past my budget for non-professional use."
1,headset,"I ordered this headset 1 week ago and received it very quickly.But when order was totalized it did not say me anything about shipping which was half of my order price.When I received headset the quality is so poor, the person I am talking to doesnt hear me at all and only himself.I contacted seller 4 times whithout any answer. Really wanted to return it but dont know what to do. Never buy from amazon!"
2,This is Gang Mom,"Just a warning This book has already been published under the name Gang Mom and it did not have very good reviews then so I wonder why they decided to re publish it ,and as a matter of fact, even using another title? I get the bad feeling they are trying to fool the customers, thinking they buy a new true crime book.So I decided to warn you. Not one of the better True crime books."
2,Gang behavior is alive in America!,"Gang mom, Mary Thompson, persuades several of her young members to gang style shoot a snitch. The book tells the tale of the event and how Mary tried to blamee everyone else so she wouldn't be charged with planning the murder of 18 year-old Aaron Iturra. Mary is heartless, sociopathic, deceitful, and cold. She possesses the power to brainwash members of her gang to commit the act to save her son from being sentenced to a juvenile detention center.Once the act os committed she takes no responsibility for the act. She willingly points the finger at everyone in the gang so that the heat will be taken off of her. Eventually the truth is told, Mary is arrested, charged with mastermining the brutal death of Aaron, and incarcerated for life, without the possibility of parole."
1,zzzzzzzzzzz,I got half way through and put it down. It was just plain BORING!!! Now I'm saving it for my next camping trip to start the fire!!!
3,Great Series/poor ending,"The High Hurdles series has been captivating. This last book, however, really did not conclude well. After spending 9 1/2 books to get DJ from 14 to 16, we find out very little about what happens prior to the final page. Ms. Snelling needed to either leave the ending hanging more, or add another book to fill in the missing years."
1,Kindle Edition STILL broken,"I think this book is GREAT, and I really want it on Kindle...I hoped that, since the last Kindle review in March, this edition would have been fixed.It hasn't been.Not only is Chapter 3 missing, Chapter 1, which isn't complete, is spread out...some of it is before Chapter 2, some of it is after. The separation between chapters isn't terribly clear. Additionally, you can't swipe down (on the Kindle Touch) to get to the next chapter.Returned it immediately. Super bummed out."
1,"Amazing Book, DON'T BUY KINDLE VERSION","I am a scholar of gender and religious history (currently completing a PhD). This is a seminal piece of scholarship and I highly recommend it. HOWEVER, the kindle edition is awful! Mine was missing half of the first and the entire third chapters. I promptly returned it and bought a hardback copy.Thanks but no thanks Amazon, what a failure!Also, the Kindle version does not contain traditional pages so citing is difficult."
3,it was for school,"it was an interesting book, its good that someone took the time to try and present the other element to the church: women. since paul does say there is no jew nor greek, male nor female but that all one in Messiah Yeshua. But I feel as though there is still not enough evidence that women were a leading role in churches, only in the small instances we find in history. Maybe the Vatican will have more documents about this topic since they just released thousands and thousands of documents for public view."
5,Hands down the best resource for passing boards...,"I just passed my Adult Primary Care Boards today on the 1st try, and I can say that out of all of the resources I used, this one was the best. If you study best by taking practice tests, then this is your book. I found these practice questions to be MOST like those on the exam and really feel that while Fitzgerald, Leik, and Hollier also helped, this review will expedite your studying. It really is worth whatever you have to spend if you study best by taking practice exams/question review."
3,Just passed the AANP for Adult and ANCC for Geri!,"I used this book as a supplement to the Margaret Fitzgerald book. I liked this book for all the practice questions it provides. I also loved this book b/c it includes a CD with all the questions as well. And the CD is structured the same way the test is structured so you can get a good feel for the program and not be overwhelmed the day-of the exam.I found the questions in this book to be very similar to the AANP and ANCC exam questions.This is a great book, but I would recommend it only as a supplement to other study material."
3,summer horse,"In this book, the Saddle Club returns to Moose Hill, a fancy riding camp. Trouble arises soon, however, when Lisa is put in a different cabin than Stevie and Carole, and Carole, who has decided to ride a camp horse to save her father money, finds she simply cannot get along with her new assigned horse. Also, there's a mysterious new girl, Piper, who's friendly and an excellent rider but seems to be hiding something. Will these issues get resolved by the end of their two-week stay?"
5,Good Stuff,"For those music fans interested in tunes that make you move and groove, this album's a must-buy. Quite simply put, these dudes rock. Rebecca's Statue's varied influences open up a whole new window to jamming fusion. The only thing better than listening to the album is seeing the band live. So, you'll have something to look forward to -"
5,Strawberry Pie for the Ears,"If you enjoy eating strawberry pie at any point in the year, than you will love the long-awaited debut album from one of the best jam bands in Chicago. Statue jams are flowing, yet tight, every instrument fits together like a 100 piece jigsaw puzzle. And just like it's hard to ignore that jigsaw, it's hard to take ""Drinking"" from your cd player. Also, if you love that warm feeling that comes over you when you eat pumpkin pie, specifically on Thanksgiving, then you too will love this cd, and cherish it, just like Katie, from the lyrics of ""Backstreet Mary"", cherishes her turkey subs from Blimpie. Instrumental sections fit together like a statue, specifically a Picasso, maybe the one in Chicago. ""The Picasso"". The Statue. If you love Christmas, buy this CD."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this CD because I liked one of their songs ""Tiene Espinas El Rosal"" and I thought they would have other nice songs. I was quite wrong. I found just about all of their other songs pretty boring. In fact, they tend to sound like they are all slight variations of one melody. They still sound all alike. The songs have a nice beat if you like dancing cumbia, but overall, there was not much listening pleasure.One more thing. Whoever came up with the idea of having some guy say random non-sense thing and yelling ""pi pi pi pi pi"" on just about all their songs, should be shot! It is very annoying and ruins the one or two songs that are decent on this cd."
5,A treasure for the poet and the cook,"If you love poetry and cooking, as I do, this is the cookbook for you. The food will warm your stomach and the poetry is sure to touch your heart. Poetry and food--could there be a better combination?"
2,annieb,"This has a chemical smell, not like fresh lemon verbena that I have in my garden. I ended up giving away to neighbor. I would pass on this one if I were you..."
3,Okay,"I was really attracted to the retro type label on this soap (lavender) and thought it would look great in my kitchen, but something about the color of the plastic or soap above and below the label makes the soap bottle look dingy and not as nice in person. It was also smaller than I hoped it would be. Looks small next to my dish soap bottle. The soap works well and the scent is pleasant as other reviewers mentioned."
4,Lemon Verbena Comfort,"I like the entire Mrs. Meyer line since it is environmentally responsible and does a good job, but this soap is fantastic. I've been using it for a couple of years now. It is gentle to the skin, has this great subtle scent, and is one of the few soaps that can tame the smell of onions after I've been slicing and dicing.The scent is floral yet subtle. It reminds me of a sunny day in my garden.My husband is pretty much anti-scent and avoids anything perfumy or highly scented like the plague, but he thinks this falls under the parameter of gender friendly.I use this primarily in the kitchen and the powder room, but it is good anywhere in the house."
3,does not,"does not smell like Basil, I am unclear what it does smell like but it is sweet smelling rather than astringent like basil."
3,"It's soap, what can I really say?",The only reason I give it 3 stars is the VERY strong aroma. The scent is very noticeable and lingers for quite some time.
1,great if you have lots of oily skin.,"I'm not sure if I am allergic to this or what but I had a really bad experience with this one. I bought this last winter and began using it. After 2 washings my hands became severely dry, cracking and bleeding. I immediately quit using this product. Later in the summer I tried it again thinking it just was a dry Winter seasonal issue, I was wrong and still had the dry cracking skin. I immediately threw this away and attempted to call the customer service number on the bottle where I was put on hold for a long period of time before giving up. There is some alcohol in this product or some toxic ingredient that dries out your skin, not sure why they would want something like this in a hand soap? I will never buy it again, try it if you would like to...."
3,Emotion,"I had a difficult time reading this book. It seemed to me she fought her way through many problems that I might not have. It is a very personal book, thus the emotionality."
2,Not for kids!,"This instruction is not kid-friendly. It's very complicated and dry. Probably much better for high-school-aged kids. My 9 year old tuned out after 10 minutes of the Defense video and doesn't want to go back. Recommend ""Pistol Pete's Homework Video"" series for youngsters and leave Lennie Wilkens to the established players."
3,this was very helpful,this video was very good for me but it would not have been for little kids it is really not the basic it does not really help rookies in the game but it will help people who have been in the game
5,Excellent Individual Offensive and Defensive Instruction,"These two videos offer excellent instruction in basic individual offensive and defensive techniques. The videos are well made and clear, but not highly entertaining. While I think they could be used for young kids, the viewing time would have to be limited or their attention would quickly drift."
3,Basketball DVD,I wanted to a DVD that would suit both me as a coach and my son (6 year old) as a beginner. I echo other reviews on this product on how it is best avoided for little kids as too dry. I also had difficulty staying awake.
4,Very heavy and original!,"One of the most unknown bands ever, this cd cranks! Although it does have that 90s metal sound, it doesn't deter from enjoyment. The enhanced cd contains some outstanding videos."
5,Asset Allocation: Balancing Financial Risk,"If there's a wiser and smarter book on asset allocation, it has not been published. Gibson's emphasis on asset allocation, awareness of an investor's perceptions, goals, and risk tolerance gives a reader cogent guidance."
5,Great trailer hitch!,"Combine this product with a Master Lock trailer ball, and the one-tool torque system is great. There is a pin on the hitch, and a slot on the ball that allows you to tighten the nut for the ball using only one wrench. It is a great innovation. This product overall looks nice, and certainly has that nice feature."
4,"well made, need to include a hitch pin",fits my receiver very well. Would have liked to see a hitch pin in the package (expected to see one). Had to run to Lowes for a 5/8 hitch pin. Extra $$ plus a 40 minute drive.
2,Dont know what the fuss is all about,"Let me just start by saying that I am huge fan of chick lit and I am very easily entertained by almost any kind of read. That being said...this book was a colossal disappointment!! I was very encouraged when I read the back cover and really thought the concept was sort of cute and held great potential and it probably would have been a great read if only the story line wasn't so rushed and predictable. I almost felt like the author was in a hurry to be done with the book and it seemed like a half-hearted effort where she didn't spend any time introducing the characters or any sort of interaction between them. Before you got to know a character or a scene, you realized that the writer had already moved on to the next. There are a couple of moderately amusing lines, but not enough to make me get past my not-so-mild irritation with the storyline. Honestly, I wouldn't waste any time on this one."
3,Literary cotton candy,"I enjoy the occasional indulgence in chick lit and finding quality stuff can sometimes be a challenge. This one attracted me because of my budding interest in Indian culture. While it was a fairly cute novel, it was sheer fluff. Some of it was a fun read but, overall, it was all calories and no nutritional value."
2,better books out there,"Yes it is a quick and easy read, but such a predictible soap opera/Bollywood story with very little development that you can really do without it. This genre is booming and there are some great books out there, I would advocate trying to find another title to buy"
3,Witty and evocative writing on an improbable plot (even for chick lit),"Anjali Banerji's writing is funny and her descriptions of events are so evocative that you can almost see the colors smell the aromas and taste the food. Her descriptions of people also vividly conjure up three dimensional individuals. However, the plot and characters need to be fleshed out more - even when it's a frothy read."
2,There are better books out there.,"I finished the book, which I consider an accomplishment. It's not so much that this book was bad; it was just your typical story and the writing style (with the humor attempts) got old about halfway through.The basic story line seemed to be: girl doesn't want to get married, girl meets guy who is hot AND rich AND nice, girl falls in love. Furthermore, the story is so typical that she doesn't even bother to fill in the blanks as the story jumps around. I could recommend much better Indian romances, just not this one."
5,It's a MisTree to Me!,"How some people can be talented, and blessed with an insight to life that just makes them GLOW! Moody Blues fans, Pink Floyd fans, Bob Marley fans, anyone who loves music that touches the synchronicities of life, and the knowledge that we are One... will LOVE Michael Monroe!Chosen to open for Dr. Wayne Dyer in Madison WI, this Minnesota virtuoso even brings his own electricity with him!You just have to listen, or better yet, SEE him if you can! Buy everything he's done, you will not be disappointes"
5,Best musicians on the planet,"Alright, I have to agree with all the other people that reviewed this DVD. It IS in fact amazing, there are guest stars musicians from all over the world, the asian guy singing three notes at a time, the indian precusionist. and many things more, jus plain amazing. But there is one small thing that I noticed that really bugs me, and all the other reviewers failed to mention it, maybe they didnt notice it, but here it goes. The audience watching this show, are the biggest posers in the world, you see these people dancing like retarted hippos, and the camera keeps focusing on them. its really funny at first, but then it just gets annoying. Other than that, this DVD is amazing."
5,All Hail Bela Fleck!!!,"This is an early Christmas gift for music lovers!! This DVD concert was as great as I'd hoped it would be! Fleck and the 'tones are joined by some fantastic musicians who joined them in recording ""Outbound"", the most recent BF&TF CD. This DVD leaves no doubt that they are some of the most talented and versatile musicians alive today. Most of the material in this concert is from ""Outbound"", but that is a good thing! Would've been nice to get a performance of ""Stompin' Ground"", a perennial concert favorite, but that's why I have the ""Live Art"" double CD. Introduce yourself and your friends to the magic that is Bela Fleck and The Flecktones. Regular music fans don't even DESERVE music and playing this good!"
5,5 stars and counting,"I don't hand out 5 stars easily. I approached this DVD as I would any other of its kind: ""Okay, impress me."" I hear a lot of music and know a lot of musicians; I am one myself. It's easy to become inured to talent and have an almost so-what attitude. However, from the time I pressed Play until it ended, I was--what's the word?--astounded. Yep, that's it. Flabbergasted.Bela and Co. have raised the standard for musicianship so high that most of the rest of us will have to be content with merely playing."
2,Incredibly Repetitious,"Hearing so many good things about this DVD, I decided to give it a try. Being a musician, I was totaly impressed with the talent by all of the musicians. Unfortunately, the song selection was little to be desired. Every song sounded just like the one before it. The one good thing about the DVD was Victor Wooten's rendition of Amazing Grace. You don't have to take my word for it, but I think that I would save the cash on this one."
2,Really boring,"Don't bother with this video. It looks like your grandparents home movies. The production is really low-budget, it's old grainy pictures with boring voice-over narration, and it's not remotely current or interesting. They don't even mention the red-light district of Amsterdam, they think there is still a wall in Berlin, and the narrator sound like some boring office manager reciting next years budget. It makes the Rick Steves stuff on PBS positively tingle with inspiration, and that's pretty bad."
4,Robin Williams Amazingly funny,"This is on one of the Funniest Robin Williams stand up performances ever to be made his witty and outlandish perfomance on stage is captivateing, in this video he uses and combines the topics of drugs, sex, and even his young son to place you in stitches I was on the floor withen the first five minutes and you will be too. A barrel of laughes like no one else can produce."
3,Not bad....,"Given the dearth of recordings of this Christmas gem by one of the great French Romantic composers, it's a good thing - on balance - that this performance has been recorded and made available. I'm going to try another one though, since, in my opinion, the potential of the score can be more fully and satisfyingly realized. To my ears, the tempi and intensities of several of the movements are on the soporific side; and the balance among the soloists - as well as the pitch accuracy of the tenor - could be better."
1,Necromancy,"Here is a project of some note because it was so awful it destroyed the film careers of both Orson Welles, who was at the end of the trail anyway, and Pamela Franklin, who was trying to move into adult roles. The original title was ""Necromancy,"" changed presumably because people who like horror films are too dumb to know what necromancy means."
2,I was not BEWITCHED by this,"But I wasn't bored either. This one can join Orgy Of The Dead in my collection as one I show people who want to see the most freaked out movie ever. I have no idea where this came from, but Todd Sheets produced it so I had to buy it. Must have been early in his career. He should have directed it as well. No gore, no anything really, but a good story and some really odd plot twists. Acting for the leads is good, but the rest is SOOOO bad."
3,need more info on technical specs,First attempt to install module failed because there was not enough information notifiying you that it need to be on the same 115v phase leg of a split 220v leg. Lucky I read reviews on product and saw the feedback from another reviewer. You can just install the module anywhere you want then move the remote transmitter/controller around til it works(same branch phase) or if you have the electrical equipment to trace it out.
5,Another JAK reprint that is right on target!!!,"I have been dusting off some of my old series JAK's since they are being reprinted, and sad some are very dated. But this one stands the test of time. It is JAK all the way and she scores a ten with this one.When Rebecca Wade inherits a strip of land from a distant relative, she steps right in the middle of generations long freud between the Stockbridges and the Ballards. The women of her family have always owned this piece of land and the men from both sides have always wanted and were not beneath trying to use her ancestors to get it. And it seems Rebecca finds the situation is repeating itself. It turns out she was given a job for Kyle Stockbridge as his personal assistant, with her not knowing he wants the lands and gives her the job for that reason. In short time, Kyle learns her wants Rebecca even more, but he is going to have a hard time proving to her.It is JAK at her best and a wonderful read!!"
3,This is a republication of an earlier book,"Once again I bought a new book only to end up reading an older novel that was originally published as one of the series romances under either Jayne Ann Krentz or her earlier pen name Stephanie James. The publisher has repackaged several of these romances and charged the price of a new paper back novel. As much as I enjoy Ms. Krentz's books, I find it annoying to pay full price for a paper back novel and find I already read it several years ago."
2,* ANNOYING Reader !!!!,"The story itself might have been good, but very hard to judge because the READER was HORRENDOUS! The drawn out over-announciation of each ""breathy"" word was unrealistic, over the top and embarrassing. I tried hard to get through it but found myself laughing most of the time."
2,shocks,I was very disappointed with this purchase.these shocks do not actually fit the honda oddysey.I had to improvise and use a rubber bushing from a hardware store to make these fit.These shocks could not be bolted to the lower control arm without these bushings;and they were missing.
1,I'd rather be dead...,"Love Stephen King. Loved the book ""'Salem's Lot"". Liked the original movie, even if it was a bit dated by the time I saw it. This piece of crap, however...This was awful. As much as I wanted to see it, I still ended up fast-forwarding through half of it. It was about as interesting and well-done as an amateur porn that contains no sex whatsoever.Someone asked me if I wanted to watch it again with them. I couldn't express how much I did not want to watch this, so I went to a forest in Transylvania, waited for a vampire to bite me, turned into a vampire, then drove a stake through my heart and collapsed into a pile of bone and ash, screaming ""nooooo"" as I faded away.I think that got the point across.I am now a dead-undead, which means my soul is eternally at unrest and I am doomed to a 4th-dimension hell, but at least I don't have to watch that awful movie again."
1,Title is interesting,"This was the worst piece of acting. It was a total waste of money, not what I expected at all. If you haven't bought it don't."
1,A Horrible follow up to Salem's Lot,Oh how I wish I had not purchased this movie. The acting is mediocre. The story is boring and ridiculous. The special effects are horrible. The movie is not a worthy continuation of the Salem's Lot franchise.
1,WHY SO EXPENSIVE FOR A BOOTLEG???,DO YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS......This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media.WHAT YOU ARE GETTING HERE IS THE EQUIVALANT OF A FRIEND OF YOURS BURNING YOU A COPY. THE STUDIO HAS NOT RELEASED THIS MOVIE. I'M GUESSING AMAZON SOME HOW GETS THE RIGHTS FROM THE STUDIO TO REPRODUCE THIS ON DVD AND THEY WHACK YOU 25 BUCKS. THANKS A LOT AMAZON!!!
1,"Aptly named, return it.",The competence of Mr. Moriarity only makes the rest of it look that much worse. Return to Salems Flop would be a better title. You can almost smell the horror as Mr. M ponders the possible demise of his career. Luckily it pulled through. It looked pretty close there. Really scary man.I'll bet his friends have fun giving him **** for this one.
4,A return to salems lot.(All things considered...),"It has come to my attention that a number of comments have been posted in critique of this movie.The only logical conclusion I can come to is that the commentators either: A. Did not see the original Salem's Lot, or B. Are not thoroughly familiar with movies from this time frame.Coming from an unbiased perspective and considering the year this movie came out, I rate this movie as a Strong 9 (not quite a 9.5) on a scale of 1 to 10. The plot was seasoned with intrigue, The acting was considerably standard for the time and the special effects were not the worst. All in all I would say the ""Flow"" of this movie was actually superior to the prequel. Of course, there's no winning with some individuals. As the adage points out: ""You can't please everyone""."
5,Classic,This is a classic and always will be one of the best Vampire movies in all history bottomline it is that good.
2,Cheap knockoff of the real movie,"I love Stephen King and his stories. This movie is a wannabe and does not make the cut. However, Amazon delivered it rapidly, safely and completely. I am definitely satisfied with Amazon...."
2,"Hilarious, but a bit offensive near the end","If you like seeing a classic old school vampire movie with houses blowing up, a Nazi killer, and a lot of vampires, this is for you. I have no clue who Cohen is, but the movie is so hokey, that it is a must-see.It's a bit offensive, though, especially to Americans like myself. Near the end they have a scene where a vampire-dude gets impaled on a flagpole with an American flag. And the characters didn't even bother to try to save it, they just let it burn while the vampire did his rather long death scene. Then, of course, the house blew up."
4,For the 80's B-Movie lover only.....,"If your a fan of 80's B-Movies like myself, this one is a must-have in your collection. While this doesn't compare to the original Salem's Lot, there is still entertaining humor to be had in this one. Most will rate this film terrible, but as the title of my review goes, it's only for the campy B-Movie collector only. too bad it's not officially on DVD...."
5,Salem's Lot... I have returned!!,"This sequel to the original is not as horrific as the first but its content of drama, horror , and comedy make it a must for vampire buffs!.I did enjoy the film's storyline which is totally different than the first one.Hey there's nothing wrong with a few laughs when it comes to a vampire film. After all, vampire's dont exist!."
5,can't get it out of my head.,"No,not the ELO classic. ever since I listened to this CD, the song ""om"" has been stuck in my head. Unquestionably a great melody. The whole alblum is well written and produced-"
3,nothing wrong with it,"I prefer the desmond dresser, you can't tell from the photo but this is a hollow casting so it is a C shape the photo shows the form from the back of the C making it look more substantial than it really is."
3,It's passible...,My son loved it when he received it. But couldn't produce consistent sound. I tried it myself and the notes were a bit off.
1,chingy wack,"its ppl like him that corrupt the game along with 50 cent and all of goon unit, nelly, TI, lil jon, cassidy, petey pablo, TS and all radio pop friendly song you hear on mtv or the radio."
1,Was a bunch of mumbo jumbo,I really tried to read this book.. but it's just so full of mumbo jumbo and to robotic feeling just couldn't get the Vibe from it. it now sits in my trash can after moving it from shelf to shelf.....anyway.... maybe you will like it I just didn't.
5,A Marriage & Family Therapist from California,"Only read this book if you want to change your life. This book is for people who want to help themselves and believe that they have choices in their lives. As a therapist, I believe this concept is one of the most important awarenesses you can have. Once a person accepts this they know they can have more control over their reactions in every life situation. Dr. Stevens book is not to entertain but to give well thought out strategies for rising above difficult situations and moving towards ""harmonious functioning"", which he defines as having happiness and harmony in your life."
4,Questionable Production,"Marshall is an amazing songwriter... one who has never gotten the exposure he should have. The production on this album does not do him justice. Sure, the words are there, but the music is not as good as Marshall's home studio stuff. *Sigh.* One day..."
4,Marshall Coleman -Whatever Happened?,"Marshall Coleman is undoubtly one of of the most gifted and talented musicians I have come across in my forty years of being involved in the music industry. I can write this and be certain of it as he spent many many days and nights creating, jamming, and just plain playing around in our home. I take great pride in his acknowledging our entire family as a part of his life in this albumn. We were investors in the Marshall Coleman Band, his home recording studio, and very proud to be the keepers of most of the ""original digital copies"" of his studio work.We all have many paths to walk -I hope we get to see as well as listen to him with more of his great music and inspiring lyrics again. Lots of Love Marshall- The Beauchamps"
1,Dated monotone ...,"Being a Cunard aficionado and traveled transatlantic on this beautiful ship, I bought this video to compare notes.This was filmed 20 years ago and today is so grainy, high in contrast, and so 60's, it's painful to watch.Doug Jones voice is so monotonic, we fell asleep often trying to get through it.There is another VHS available here ... with Cunard's logo on it in Manhattan. Filmed closer to 1995, it's a far better value and we could actually recognize aspects of the ship!Robert"
3,The ultimate travelogue on the ultimate ship: 20 years ago.,"We have travelogues with better production values since this. But still, around the world in 80 days, 24 ports. A trip for seasoned cruisers for sure. A cruise on a luxury liner of any length is not for everyone. I'm an old sailor & enjoy the days at sea. Cruising is the only way I vacation until I run out of ports. The stops range from the regulars such as Rio, Singapore, Hong Kong & Hawaii. But there are also little known places like Salavador Brazil, the island of Mauritius & Korea. The logistics for such a cruise are an immense challenge not unlike preparing for war. All on the Queen Elizabeth II the biggest & finest cruise ship afloat in its time."
3,Enjoyable Travel Documentary Soon to Become a Classic..,"Since the QE2 has been sold and '08 is her last year as a cruise ship (she's to become a floating hotel in Dubai), this video, no doubt, will become a nostalgic classic. I have done one transatlantic crossing and one Mediterranean cruise on the QE2 and love her. This film from '89 is definitely dated but still shows much of what the ship has to offer and I enjoyed Doug Jones' wry sense of humor! The ports of calls on this World Cruise were very exotic to one who has not been to South America or Asia and I found them fascinating. The colorful landscapes were beautiful and not as grainy as the filming on board the ship. The film ends with the QE2 sailing into NYC harbor showing both the Statue of Liberty and the Twin Towers reminding us of a skyline no longer with us."
5,"Do yourself a favor, and buy it now","If I could give this book 50 stars, I would. Whether used for quick reference or as a guide that shows you what is absolutely necessary to study in order to educate yourself to the level of cultural literacy, this book is invaluable. I have used this book on almost a daily basis since I bought my first copy four years ago. Every kid over 12 should have it. Every adult should have it. No, I am not the author, just a very big fan."
5,excellent reference guide for students,"The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy is an essential guide for any advanced middle school, high school, and even college student. The dictionary provides detailed explanations of various cultural events as well as e plantations of analogies typically used in literature. For any English literature class, this will definitely come in handy!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"This book does not contain the level of sophistication that I was expecting. I have gone to it on several occasions, and each time it did not contain the information I was seeking. All in all, I suppose it is a good general reference on Western (mostly American) history."
1,More opinion and rhetoric than research,"The authors have chosen to promulgate an ideology instead of research the truth. Is this intended as a reference book? Page 340 lists ""separation of church and state"" as being ""required by the first amendment to the United States constitution"". Are these authors too lazy to read the constitution, or intentionally lying here? The constition does NOT mention this ideology - this glib comment is an excerpt from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson regarding DENOMINATIONS, not religion. do your homework boys. What a sad example Professor Joseph F. Kent, (Univ. of VA) is setting for his students."
4,Very informative and colorful,This book provides a lot of detail about an interesting and little-known period in toy history - the reign of the slot cars. I bought it for a friend who collects these cars and ended up reading it myself in one afternoon. Great photos.
1,Self-aggrandizing fluff,"Chock-full of DeLespinay's ""small fish in a small pond"" ego and little else, this book is a waste of time and money. While he'd like everyone to *think* he was ""Present at the Creation,"" DeLespinay was a mid-70's emigrant from France, and thus a VERY latecomer to the US slot scene. Even THAT dying scene isn't remotely well-covered here -- there's NO technical content, NO valuation guides (you *could* go to DeLespinay's ludicrous website and automatically divide his prices by 5, I guess..); in fact, unless you enjoy nonsensical, name-dropping anecdotes about how Phi-Phi invented everything from fire to the Gurney flap (no kidding), and minimalist murky photos of such asinine slot-flops as the Asp and similar Thingies, simply give this steaming pile a wide miss. Instead, for REAL information from a guy who really WAS present at the creation, get the new Robert Schliecher book ""Racing and Collecting Slot Cars"" and any of his older books if you can find them."
3,dancing alone,"Twenty years ago, in ""If I'm So Wonderful...,"" Susan's Page's advice to women singles was: if the guy doesn't meet your needs, get rid of him and move on. You may have to kiss dozens of frogs before you find a prince. You deserve the best. Don't settle for less. Today's advice is: it's up to you, not the guy in your life, to meet your own needs; and if you do that, you don't need to get rid of him, and it doesn't much matter whether he's a frog or a prince. Either way, then and now, it's all about me. The fifty guys you needed to date until you found the right one, back in the eighties, or the guy you're choosing to stick around with today are equally ciphers, a means to an end of self-fulfillment as I do the dance of me, myself and I, trusting that for me -- the one who counts -- and maybe for others who, as adjuncts to myself, may or may not count, things will work out just as they're meant to. The words are different but the tune is the same, and both times, she may be right."
2,Hype Happy,Overblown rhetoric to achieve a book that could have easily been a magazine article with a somewhat useful quiz. So clearly in it for the money that it damages the message.
4,"Family Law Attorney recommends this book before you see me.,","Family Law Attorney recommends this book before you see me., September 7, 2006Reviewer: ""R.P."" (Berkeley, CA)As I family law attorney, I see many couples after months and even years of ""conventional"" talk therapy (costing a great deal). Try this first. The suggestions and tactics in this book are those one often sees partners use in happy,long term marriages; e.g., the acceptance of behaviors you probably aren;t going to change in yourself or have little chance of changing in the partner. This book ""ages"" you to that divine state. You learn how to develop a blessed acceptance which frees one up to enjoy life instead of acting out the old radio couple, the Bickersons, who never stop nattering at each other until one dies or leaves."
5,For Open Minded partner that wish to bring more joy into their live,My partner and I read this book years ago and I still remember much of it.. Should be required reading for a sexually mature individual.. If you read this book and do now have a 100percent improvement in your live and love making your not doing it right... you need to re-read it.
5,great book for storytellers,"really enjoyed this book, the authors are inspiring and it added a fun and creative element to my language arts program!"
5,Children Telling Stories.,I would definitely use this seller again. I had to read this book for a school assignment and am so glad that I did. I love the book and will be using lots of the information that I got from it. It is a great book for teachers that want to use story telling as a way of getting their students interested in learning.
4,Finally Found the Right Bulbs,"After going online and to several home stores,I finally found the correct bulb. I did not have the original package for the burnt out bulbs and it was really hard to find the correct replacements. Bulbs fit perfect and packaging and delivery was great."
5,I'm pleased!,"There really isn't much to say about a light bulb. It either works or it doesn't. But I am pleased with this purchase. The transaction was quick and accurate. The price was very good, shipping was free, and I received it within a few days. You can't ask for more than that."
5,"A durable, quality watchband.",Better quality than the original strap that came with the watch. The chromed buckle is very sturdy.
3,If you had lived there...,"I lived in Hawaii 1985-2000, and was priviledged to see some live performances by the Makaha Sons of Ni'ihau (incl. IZ) and later IZ himself going solo. I bought this dvd and was very disappointed when I heard the narration - it was a haole and his voice seemed cold and without respect for IZ. Why wasn't the Hawaiian soul and some pidgen and humor used? The narration is what keeps this from being a 5 start review by me. To truly see Israel, try ""Hot Hawaiian Nights"" (2002), a dvd of a local news entertainment show. It shows his solo start in 1993, and his successful arrival in 1995. You will hear him himself throw ""da kine"" around and have plenty fun. great songs and fun, live performances. I watched it 4 times in a row when it came, so that I could spend some time getting to visit with the real Israel Kamakawawiwo'ole again! He disappears into his uke whenever he sings... a beautiful soul."
4,messenger bag,It's a great handbag carries my laptop and a couple of school books its very durable and the picture looks great.
1,Keep looking!,"If you're looking for saints stories to tell children, this book gives the bare minimum. For re-telling you will need to use a lot of creative authorship in order to make the stories ""live"" for your children. There aren't a lot of books available for saints story re-telling, but by far and away the best is ""The Giant at the Ford"" by Ursula Synge. It is (of course) out of print, but used copies are available."
1,GO TO WALMART!!,"What an unbelievably bad price! At my local Walmart, it is about $17.00 a can. A miracle formula for my son, but definitely a terrible deal."
1,RIP OFF,"This formula normally sells for between $22-26 in the store. It is offensive that someone would take advantage of a baby's condition to profit so much. Don't buy from this person! The formula is great, but buy it elsewhere."
1,Cost less in stores!,The price here is outrageous! Walmart sells the exact same 16 oz can of Nutramigen for $18 and change. Thank Heavens! It's hard enough being able to afford it in the first place. I hope no one buys it here. I have a question for the seller...Why so much?
1,Outrageous Price!,"I cannot believe the price that Amazon is selling this formula! My local grocery store has it for $19.99. I came to Amazon hoping to find an even better deal, as I usually do. I was greatly disappointed to find their price more than $15 more per can!"
4,good looking but too large,These run large and wide it appears and I will have to return them for a smaller size. Arrive quickly.
3,Sperry Classic Boatshoe,"Shoe is comfortable and lets feet breath. The original had a smooth bottom that would not track mud and dirt onto the deck. This revised version uses a bottom that tracks mud and material does not wear well. Price is about $30 too high. Considering Sperry has these made in Communist China by slaves for $5.00, they should sell for $30. That is about what they are worth. Sperry needs to get back to basics and stop trying to satisfy every demand."
2,Sperry Disappointment,"I have purchased this exact same Sperry Topsider within the past 1-2 years(same color, model and size) and was extremely pleased with the fit and ""the look."" The first time I wore this new pair (for one whole day)I experienced severe discomfort with the inner toe cap, which is stiff and rubbed against the top of my toes. Unfortunately, the pair was stained during that first wearing and I don't believe I can return them. Love Sperry's, but this pair...not so much! Great look with jeans/shorts...price paid lower than other retailers...Amazon delivery was timely."
3,Slightly Disappointed,Read the reviews and got my usual size: 10M. They are very tight width wise and a little long length wise. I'm going to exchange them for 9.5 Wide.
3,men's sperry top-sider striper,"This shoe was exactly what I had been searching for and unable to find in retail shops. The quality, fit, etc are great. It arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner."
5,Awesome,"This DVD is a mirror image to her class she offers in person. She is clear in her directions of positions, and if you find yourself not sure, you can always look. She also offers positive words all throughout the DVD, especially when moves are tough and you find yourself not wanting to finish them. You can definietly feel the burn of certain positions and when you are through you find yourself feeling accomplished. I would recommend this DVD to more advanced yogi's."
2,HOW COULD ANYONE LIKE THIS TOY?,"I don't like this toy. It is not very sturdy. When I just finshed building it, a piece fell off. When I tried to put it back on, more pieces fell off. Don't buy this toy."
5,ARC-170 Starfighter,"This is one of the best Lego Star Wars sets out there and it was the second one I got. I gave it a 3 in durability because its suposed to come apart. It comes with 3 clone pilots and 1R4-P17 droid (unless if yours is screwed up). It has 2 laser cannons on each wing, a rotatable one in the back and 2 bombs that drop when you pull the thing in the back. Have fun."
4,Great gift!,It has alot of pieces so it take a while to build. Thus making it worth your money to buy. It has a bomb port that really works. I am 12 years old and I would like to see more working features next time.
2,The triwinged fighter,This toy gives kids the proper building skill to help them later in life. It also is a lot of fun to build it and use it to make your own star wars arwy(belive i tried it). I belive that this toy is destaned for greatness in the hearts of children. I really like this toy and I'm sure lots of people will agree with me.
3,Its cool!,It needed more than just a review of the song crazy train.It needed reviews of some of Randy's other songs.
4,See this and you'll know why Ozzy misses him!,"I thought this video was very analytical on the song Crazy Train, and it goes through Randy's solo with a lot of detail. Other Ozzy fans like me would have appreciated a broader selection of Randy's songs to examine. Some of the brilliance of the songs from ""Diary Of A Madman"" are left out, but the video was very cool anyway! OZZY RULES!!!"
4,Good start for beginners,This book really helped me understand Oracle from the very beginning. At the same time it gives you an introduction to all aspects right from sql to pl/sql to DBA concepts etc. It also gives you a headstart for web based applications which is a big bonus! Its a well rounded book for those who need a start and want to be experts in Oracle.
3,National Dean's list member,I have this book only because I am in it. I truly could not see why anyone would want it if they were not either in it or had a close relative that was in it.
4,"Great music, poor sound quality of live performance","Fighting Gravity is a fine ska band (little bit of this, little bit of that) and I had the pleasure of seeing them live twice while at the College of William & Mary. This disc set covers just about all of the songs I had previously heard and they are all great songs. Unfortunately, the audio of this live performance is pretty bad. At times, the music fades to a whisper requiring one to crank up the stereo... I'm hoping to find these songs on a studio recording..."
3,Interesting..if you are a fan.,"It's been almost 20 years since I first bought a copy of this video. That's why I'm surprised there are no reviews here.Anyway, this is a nice collection of all Clash videos including a couple of live songs, Train in Vain and Should I stay or should I go. it does begin loudly and excitingly with Tommy Gun, folowing Londo Calling, which I never thought to be up the song standard, a pleasing live Train in Vain and so on..Trouble is, it does become a bore after so many times of Bank Robber and The call up and the latter videos. Besides, the live versin of Should I stay is not on my favorite Clash list. It shows a band with no longer intensity and cracks. The problem, and dissapointment, after so many years, is the fact that the band always failed to provide enough good quality live footage to its fans except for a few promotional pieces. So while I recommend the video to any fan, I must say it 'll be sitting on the shelf after a while."
1,Quit working!,"I bought this for my infant's bedroom to play lullabyes, but after two days it quit working. (It's not the batteries.)I should have paid more money for something more durable. Bummer!"
4,"Excellent Upgrade, but limited 3D capabilities","I really like the new interface of Photoshop and new features, but I found the 3D capabilities rather limited. Years ago in Adobe Photodeluxe 4, Adobe included the ability to add 3D models to pictures, but they were only from one company and not compatible with anything else. This is an improvement over that system, but I was hoping for 3D model texturing tools. If you could generate new maps with this program it would be a must have for any 3D artist--as it stands nows it gives you the ability to edit pre-existing texture maps within Photoshop which can be exported, but little else. Clearly the 3D end needs to be improved upon and I'm sure it will be in future editions. I reccomend those interested in it's 3D usage to download the demo first to be sure it suits their needs, otherwise most people might find the unextended upgrade better for them."
2,Promptly fell apart,The pillow is actually two pieces held together by cloth tape. The tape came undone after a couple weeks of use. I would not recommend.
2,"Not like a brick as I expected, but an OK regular pillow","I bought it a year ago. And I have used it since then. It is not at all like a brick or that can leave your hand shape after you pressed on it. Is that still one kind of memory foam? I just used it as a regular pillow, not memory foam pillow. It is an OK one. And my neck feels better than before."
3,it's ok,i guess it's okit's too hard for mei have already another memory foam pillow whick is softer than this one.
1,Ummm I think this is actually a pillow shaped BRICK,"We couldn't believe how rock hard this pillow was out of the package. My 210 pound husband stood on it and it didn't budge. This is way to hard to be marketed as a pillow. We will be sending it right back. Oh well, I guess you can't buy pillows on-line."
2,Being honest,"The album lacks replay in my opinion, some songs are good. But nothing too spectacular. Linkin Park is a better buy, but if your looking for something new, this might be good for you. So I'll finish by saying there's better albums to buy, so browse around a bit first."
2,I used to listen to Borialis,"I was going through high school as Borialis got big at the jersey shore. they used to be the most original band around, but that was on their first record ""Out da Rug Room"" It was fresh, funk-driven trip-hop that made you wanna get up and groove. Their live shows were full of surf jams, hip-hop melodies, loud rock music, and of course the sweet sounds of Doc-Nu on the one and two's. But then Ricky's head got really big and they decided to sign with a major record label-Capitol. I hope Ricky likes his trade-funk for pop metal! My advice to Ricky: stick with YOUR sound. You were about to change the face of music. Have fun without your band! Call me when you get back together."
2,"Cute, but sends BAD messages","I am a writer, so I can really appreciate all the funny, superbly written sentences in this book. The illustrations are precious, too. But c'mon, do we really want to raise kids who think these things are funny: three bully pigs punching a smaller, more helpless piglet in the snout because they think he's a ""baby""; an ""adult"" dog threatening to bite children if they don't behave; an spiteful older sibling who sticks his newborn brother outside in the cold while he steals his pacifier, or -- worse of all -- the mother pig who doesn't pay enough attention to know any of this is going on. Perhaps in this generation of violent computer games and television shows, this book is the lesser of two evils? I say don't waste your money on bad messages for this impressionable picture-book set, even if the pictures are darned cute."
2,This book scarred my 4-year-old.,"I preface this by saying that every kid/parent has different preferences and I may not the best judge. But I just didn't understand this book. And neither did my four year old, who was terrified and in tears half way through. The page where the bullies hit the kid was so scary for him. The drawings made the bully pigs seems malicious and scary, and the drawing of them actually hitting Benny in the mouth was just too much. I didn't get it. ""Papa, will you never read that scary book again,"" my son said through sniffles. We never will."
3,A Bit Underwhelming,"I loved Bob Roll's first efforts. However, to really get an emotional feeling for what the tour is like, I suggest reading (before Saturday!) Dave Shield's ""The Race."" I met the author while competing at this year's Sea Otter Classic. I couldn't put the book down. Nor could my wife. As Lance Armstrong would say, ""Out You Go."""
2,Forgettable,"As so many TdF books have been, I ""lost"" this one out of my collection pretty quickly. I know there won't be any more TdF books with my name on them again."
3,Good primer on TDF but I was expecting more,"Nothing particularly new if you have watched a few tours but explains a lot that can seem confusing if you are watching for first time or two. Should have maps and discussion of each 2004 stage - but has only a few brief descriptions of some of the climbs. Well written in plain English, hard to imagine this is the same gonzo who wrote Bobke II. What's the french word for ghost?"
2,Just not right,"Bob Roll's ""The Tour de France Companion"" is terribly disappointing. The number of glaring mistakes and misidentified photos is appaling.I received my copy as a freebie sent to our bicycle club. I cannot recommend it to our members. The effort behind the book is, I believe, honest and it is fairly well written, though obviously lacking in Bobke style. The American understanding of velo-sport is tenuous and Lance-centric at best and so far this book is not helping things. Getting things like Tyler Hamilton's home town and 2003 tour placing is galling, especially to fellow New Englanders.If there is a 2005 version, I hope they check the facts more carefully."
3,Dated...but useful for ideas when in a jam...,"Rather boring lay-out, but it does provide info useful to help when looking for ideas not currently thought of when setting up projects. We use it in a fossil preparation laboratory for general review, but again, there are probably other texts that might fit the bill. Nevertheless I am glad our lab has it...too many young ""creators"" forget the obvious and this book helps remedy this problem."
2,What? NO PICTURES?,"This book contains some nice little tidbits of info but it is sorely lacking due to its lack of pictures. The 18 page long list of tool dimensions and weights gives you no real info without pics to show what they're talking about. With only 5 images in the entire book (including the front cover) I feel that 80% of the potential value of the book is missing.Without pictures, this book is simply an expanded glossary of sculptural terms."
3,"Great beginning, typical ep trappings end","3 1/2Great first half, captures Deathcab doing what they do best, much less effortlessly then in recent times. Last few songs die down a bit since the last is just an alternate, which makes this essential for fans, but not everyone, although quite good ep."
3,Master Lock 2837ATSC Hitch Ball Mount,"Master Lock 2837ATSC Hitch Ball Mount...Very well made, quality product. The shipping charge was >$6.00. I expected it to be have the, ""No Spin"" feature as advertised, but I was unpleasantly surprised that it did not."
4,Great overview of standard enterprise architecture.,"My background is in enterprise application development/architecture, and I found this book to be a great introduction to the larger scope of system architecture. The patterns presented paint an easy to understand picture of what a highly capable Inter/intra- net system should look like.I found the level of detail to be great, as I was interested in an overview. If you're looking for implementation specifics, this would be a good starting point, but many of the platform-specific details would probably be found in other books."
2,this book is a waste of time,"I regret having spent at least two weeks (on and off) trying to read this book.It has some good points, yet its drawbacks make it almost useless:- it is not very practical, it is quite abstract actually- it is dry, confusing and filled with repetitions- the contents of this book could fit in 30-40 pages and this would save a lot of reading time- it is specific to J2EE and its associated architecture (web server -> application server -> database server, etc). The book's title should reflect this and yet it doesn't.- most of the so called patterns (local cache, logging, etc) have been around for some time and are much better described in other booksI could go on and on.It just suffices to say that I finished the book in the end and, since I do not wish to inflict the pain of reading this book on others, I just threw it away.In conclusion, do not waste your time reading this book."
1,Came with my MacBook,"Was fine (albeit somewhat loud) while it worked.Unfortuneatly, it only worked for five months, at which point it died completely and without any warning at all.I realize that Seagate has a pretty good reputation, but this one completely failed me...I lost a lot of valuable data, and had no warning period to recover any of it. The drive is completely dead, beyond any (affordable) recovery."
5,LOVE This One!,I heard this in the Highlands of Scotland a lot & asked who it was etc.It had a lot of US songs on it too~just loved the sounds of Scotland singers & instuments.Go check it out & play a few samples...maybe you will get bit with the bug too.When I got to Edinborough- I saw it at a magazine couner-- on tape--oh how I have played that so many times BUT my tape is stuck in the radio now.I have looked for a year now & so pleased that I found it on CD...so nice...36 songs on it too.I have even made tapes years ago for people -as we never could find it & they also loved it.So glad Amazon always pleases & it was packed well too-thanks!
3,"These protect your knees, but bind in back","I got these for my wife, who gardens and does home improvement projects. Her favorite knee protection was the old Smith and Hawken ""Japanese Gardening Pants"" with the built-in knee pads. But those are difficult to find these days, and so she thought these might do the trick. Not quite.While the gel protects her knees, as she moves from place to place in the garden or across the floor, the straps bind behind her legs, making them uncomfortable and constantly in need of adjustment. As a result, she doesn't wear them, so they don't do any good at all. We think we have a line on the pants with the built-in knee pads, so these go in the garage bin with the other great ideas that just didn't quite deliver what we wanted.But if the idea of knee pads appeals to you--and if you are working in one place, as opposed to crawling around--then these might be worth a look. They do offer knee protection. And you may be lucky--they may fit your knees differently than hers."
3,Wasn't that crazy about these...,"Although these really protect your knees from hard surfaces, the square shape of the gel pads forces you to position yourself ""just so"" to sit right on the surface. I'd much prefer a rounded gel pad so that you can just roll your knees into position instead of having to move the pad around to sit just right to get your knee on the floor. Some people may not be bothered by this, but if I'm going to be on the floor for a long time and constantly moving around, I don't want to have to keep ajusting myself to make contact square with the floor."
3,Very comfortable but tear easy,My husband does concrete and needs a good set of knee pads. These are very comfortable for him but after about a week of use the elastic has started to seperate from the knee pad. He also has a small problem with the elastic being too long and not enough velcro to make them fit tightly. So they do run a little large. Other than them seperating these are a great product if you need great support as long as you don't have a job that is tough on things.
3,I must be expecting too much.,"I have the same problem with these ""Neiko Comport Gel-Filled Knee Pads"" as I had with the ""Custom LeatherCraft G361 Professional Ultra-Flex Gel Kneepads"". Both provide a reasonable amount of comfort to my 68 year old knees. However, bothalso became very uncomfortable on the back of the knees due to the straps holding the pads on. Yes, I know, there has tobe something holding the pads in place thus, my statement that I must be expecting too much. I just can't believe I am theonly one with this problem. Someone needs to invent a system to keep the pads on the knees while at the same time notcausing pain to the back of the knees. Really, is that expecting too much?"
2,Comfortable but low endurance,"I work as a safety captain for a salesforce of over 150 route salesmen. These salesmen are the ones servicing grocery stores with our product and are constantly on their knees. I have been searching for a high-quality kneepad to help reduce injuries. I purchased 30 of these kneepads to ""test"" them out. The salesmen are saying they're really comfortable and they provide for a steady grip on the floor. There is a bit of a concave shape to them so when they're on their knees, they don't glide around as some of the round ones may permit. However, the elastic material supporting the blue part is not very durable. 5 of the heaviest users approached me and showed tears in the material, after less than a month of use. While they are comfortable, I am dissatisfied with the lack of durability and will not be ordering them in the future."
3,A Little Small,"Yes they are a little small but on the other hand I'm a little big (6'5"" and 290lbs). They seem to be very high quality but don't quite go around my mighty legs."
2,Not what expected,These pads do protect your knees WHEN they stay in place. Regardless of how tight I make them they slip down and then I must move them back to where they belong.
2,Bad Stitching,"First, the knee pads weren't as tight as I would've liked them to be on my leg, even strapped tightly. Secondly, after two days of wearing them the stitching tore at the base of the strap on the back of the knee pad. I definitely do not like the quality of these knee pads considering the price of these knee pads."
1,the worst knee pads i've owned,I just wanted to save people some money I'm a carpenter who uses my knee pads quite often. I have worn all kinds of knee pads from super cheap to fairly expensive and these were the worst ones I've ever used. They fell apart in two weeks of mild use and I've never been more disappointed in any product I've ever bought.
1,Won't stay up,These kneepads are so heavy they keep sliding down my leg no matter how tight I attach them. Finally gave up and gave them to Goodwill.
1,walking on kneww stilts,"Thought the gel was in the green coloring showing, but that's a medium hard plastic that's about 3 1/2"" thick, can't walk on my knees to clean floors too difficult and could scratch wood floors and furniture."
1,the gell is not in the front as pictured,"they are way too large and slip off-would like to return them, they are definitely not for someone of my size"
4,Measure the distance around your knee before buying,"Length:: 3:03 MinsThis is a very well constructed product. The thick gel is and foam is VERY comfortable. The pads are designed to easily take on and off with Velcro, the Velcro is nice and wide to keep from digging into the back of your leg which is an experience I have had in the past with other knee pads. Another problem that I have had with the other brand of knee pads is them falling down my leg while I'm standing or walking. The design of these knee pads have solved that problem.The one issue that I have with them is that circumference of my leg at the knee is 15 inches. The Velcro just does not have enough contact area to make a strong hold, it is because of this I am going to see if they can trade me for a smaller size. I'm an average sized man so I'm sure that a smaller size is available, I just need to find the correct person to contact for exchange.I suggest buying this if your leg is not at least minimum 16 inches around it."
2,They don't fit right,"I expected a pair of knee pads that at least fit right but, what I got was a piece of crap that almost falls down everytime you stand up or try to change positions. Sure they might protect your knees but, if your constantly trying to mess with them it's not even worth it. I am very disappointed with this product and wouldn't recommend them to anybody!"
3,Very comfy but poor construction,"These knee pads are incredibly comfortable. But after the fourth use the side seams and the top of the gel seams ripped. I clean houses and one office building. I'm very disappointed especially given the comfort level. But I've used the cure all for the moment, Duct Tape! I like the comfort that much!but on the search again"
3,Starting Your Own Business,"Although I found this book helpful, it mainly told me I needed to buy more of his books, join his association and take his classes. I may follow these steps, but this book was far from all inclusive."
5,Outstanding! Who could ask for anything more??,"Merlin Coslick has provided ALL of the information needed to begin a home-based medical billing business AND proven, real-world techniques for applying the information! Also outlined are potential problems and how to avoid them - I read the book while I completed coursework in this field and I could not have set up my business without it. It is absolutely a MUST HAVE for anyone entering the field of medical billing!"
1,Not enough information,"I purchased this book hoping I will learn more about the medical billing industry, instead it focused too much on teaching someone how to build a home-based business, which I can find another book less than its current price. There are really just 20 pages talking about what you need to be aware in the medical billing industry, I did not gather much. I do not recommend this book."
1,Less than useless,"Poorly written, poorly produced and essentially useless. Single sided photocopied pages make up the entire ""book"". The only thing professional is the slick cover used to con people into buying this book. It is useless for starting up a medical billing business and almost the same for any business. Great insights like ""you will need a phone and business cards"". As far as setting up a medical billing business DO NOT waste your money. This would be embarrasing as a 10th grade project turned in. It would be better titled ""How To Put Out an Advice Book and Fleece the Suckers""! A total waste of the paper it was printed on even."
2,Not worth it.,"For those of us in the Healthcare Management field can say that no amount of books can equal to real life experience. You don't have to buy a book to learn Medical Billing, that best way to learn is to get experience."
3,Somewhat Helpful,"Some of the information this presents is helpful, but it also raises some questions and doesn't clearly answer them. It is very vague on things like pricing your services, writing a service contract, etc. which are very important issues! Overall it was helpful as it showed me that I had a lot to consider before jumping into my business. I have been more cautious, and will hopefully be more successful, because of it. Good initial material for someone with little or no knowledge of the subject."
1,Minority view - I thought it was tedious.,"I wish I could agree with the reviewers who praise this film - I just watched it - I have the VHS of it.On the box it says ""A treat for action addicts."" - New York News, and ""Slams right into action. Crackling electricity."" - New York Times, and ""'Robbery' sizzles with excitement. Will have action addicts sweating out every scene."" Roger Ebert also gave it a good review.I guess I'm alone in thinking that it's a slow, unexciting - even tedious - film. The dialog and acting areamateurish, I think. The British style is understatement, but the actors portraying police seem very amateurish when they deliver dialog. Compared to action films today, it seems very slow and old-fashioned. The car chase in the film is good, though. Sorry that I can't agree with the high praise it gets. I do like ""Bullitt,"" though - of course - the film that Peter Yates made, later."
2,Extremely dated,"Morley's work is very much out of date at this point, and is only reprinted (so far as I can tell) because it is out of copyright and hence can be xeroxed cheaply. For a serious biography and critical assessment of Agrippa, see Charles Nauert, _Agrippa and the Crisis of Renaissance Thought_, which is hard to find but worth it. Morley's book is, however, chatty and enjoyable to read, and includes a number of humorous stories and suppositions about Agrippa's life and work. Morley's assessment of texts is very dubious indeed, although he can hardly be blamed, as he was after all writing in the mid-19th century. Occultists will find this book useless; historians may find some material here, but should start with Nauert. See also Marc van der Poel's book on Agrippa's orations, (...)"
2,student of paranormal born in GREEK CYPRUS,"IT'S A FAIRLY NICE BOOK BUT DRY AND OF NO USE FOR PERSONS WHO STUDY MAGIC IT CONTAINS SOME USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE LIFE OF CORNELIUS AGRIPPA BUT IT'S OCCULT USE IS ZERO ESPECIALY IF YOU HAVE READ AGRIPPAS 3 BOOKS ON OCCULT SCIENCE.ON THE OTHER HAND I WOULD DEEPLY RECOMENT IT FOR PERSONS INTERESTED IN AGRIPPAS LIFE OVERALL ,IN THE WAY SOCIETY AND PEOPLE USE TO (WORK)AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF A WORLD THIS EXTRAORDINARY MAN LIVED IN."
5,Absolutely worth the money!,"This clamp is pricey, but is superbly manufactured. Though is utilizes the ""vise-grip"" style clamping mechanism, I found it somewhat difficult to use ""one handed"". It comes with two pair of plastic slip-on protective jaws for woodworking, or the jaws can be removed if marring is not a factor (welding?). The jaws clamp perfectly parallel, and are capable of tremendous holding power. The 8"" width capacity is also a bonus, especially for curved lamination projects. If Norm uses it, how can it be bad?"
5,These should be everywhere,"I've had two of these clamps for about a month and they are SO useful. They work well in situations that I've tried to make due with quick-grips in the past, but the SuperGrip's just work so much better. I agree with other reviewers that I don't understand why these aren't in EVERY home improvement store - why is Bessey keeping them a secret???"
5,LOVE THIS SHAVER!!!!!!,"I just got my shaver/epilator yesterday, and allowed it to charge for the 20 to 24 hours. I showered after working out, exfoliating my legs, and arms with exfoliating shower gel. After drying off, I sat in my favorite chair and went to town epilating first my legs, then my arms. Yeah, it stung a little feeling a bit like tiny pin pricks or bee stings but I have a high tolerance to pain, and I tend to look at it the same way I look at working out, ""No pain, no gain"". Once I got the hang of moving the shaver in a quick, sweeping motion over my legs making sure to keep the shaver close to the skin, it was easy street from there. I just love this thing, and had I known it was going to work as well as it did, I would have purchased it sooner!"
2,Leaves hair untouched,"It has some pros (battery, can use under shower, less pain), but where it fails pretty much, is the epilation. This is my third epilator, and it does only a half job. If I am trying very hard, it does a 70% job. One third of the hair is just left there, no matter what. I have one bad epilator from Braun, but this is not much better when it comes to hair removal. Even if go through the same area 5 or 10 times, one third of the hair will remain. This makes the epilation much longer and not efficient at all.For comparison, my first epilator can do a decent 85-90% hair removal with a single run."
4,Good,Easy to use... Gud functions...handy product.... It is really difficult to accumulate 20 unique words to review a small product which is used once in a month...
4,my first epilator. i love it,i'm happy with my purchase. i use it to pluck my under arm hair and it does the job well. i was surprised when i first used it. it hurt a little because i wasn't prepared for the pain but its not any different than plucking - it just does it faster. The only thing i didn't like about it was that it didn't pull out the short hairs. i have to go back in with my tweezers. but i give it four stars because i get most of my hair plucked in under 5 mins. and it takes me another 5 to go in with my tweezers. such a time saver. and added bonus is i get a trimmer too! i have yet to play with that
3,"Ok, but looking for better ones","This is the first epilator that I ever owned. It does an ok job of removing hair but really just OK. It does not capture every hair, especially the fine ones. Starting to get in grown hair from this after a few months of use. I am ready to move on and find a better epilator.Below are a few pros and consPros:1) Wet/Dry - The wet feature is very helpful as it keeps pain level down. and makes cleaning the product quick and easy.2)Cordless - Don't need to sit next to an outlet, a big plus (but could also be a con, see below)Cons:1) Does not capture all hair, I need to go over the same area several times to remove all hair.2) Cordless - Battery doesn't last too long, and if I forget to recharge it, it won't be ready for me to use whenever I want to"
3,Disapointed,When I finally decided to buy this product I was excited to get it and start using it. Unfortunately it does not work as well as I hoped. I choose this one mainly because of the price but I would suggest spending a bit more money and get a higher quality product. The shaver attachment works great but the tweezer attachment does not. The results are some hair left over and short lived results. Overall I would not buy this product again.
2,not so hot,I had previously owned a Epilator before that had finally broken down. This one does not do as good of job as my old one. Thought about getting one for my daughter but decided no to.
2,Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Epilator,"This is the best of all that I have tried and the best price also. The other brand I returned because it didn't work as they stated. This one works great, no pain and very few ingrown hairs. I haven't tried it wet yet as it works great dry.Love it- Love it- Love it. I give it ""5 stars"""
3,Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epilator with Three Heads (Pink),"I like the product, but it is not as efficient as I expected. Although, useful and relatively quick. Maybe I didn't give it enough time, and also It is my first time using an epilator. We'll see."
2,Misses a lot of hair,"After using this epilator for a couple months, I decided epilating wasn't for me. Some people can take the pain, and some can't--I can't. The real reason I've given this epilator 2 stars though is that it leaves a LOT of hair behind. Obviously, one would prefer to make as few passes over the area as possible, but this epilator could never seem to grab all the hairs. You're not supposed to go over the same area multiple times, but that was the only way to get even most of the hair.On a positive note, the cordless function is nice, as is the wet/dry option. For me, some areas were easier to epilate wet, and others dry. I can't comment on the battery life, because I was never able to endure the pain that long...."
3,Panasonic epilator,"This epilator is easy to hold and use. I don't find it to be as effective as I had hoped, however. It is difficult to remove the small fine hairs around the chin and neck area and takes a number of tries before total removal. Even then, small hairs seem to ""pop"" up. If I were buying again, I would probably try another brand."
4,It is ok.,"The item arrived in perfect condition and the delivery was on time. I was very please with this company that sold me the item. However, I decided to rate this item 4 because it can irritate your skin. Personally, I got a bunch of little bumps on my legs and it can take two to three times to use the product to get used to the pain."
2,So So,"Before buying it i read reviews. The only thing i agree with is that is very painful, especially underarms. Does not remove all of the hair, few than more, waxing is much better and quicker comparing to this product. Does not grab hair even the longest ones."
3,I got semi-positive feedback from the user,"I am not the user of the product. But I have been told that it works just fine. The fact that it can be used in shower/bath makes it a great product. Otherwise, the earlier Brauns that she used to use was just as good."
1,Scared me,"I can't tell anyone how it works because I never used it after reading the instructions for this shaver/epilator, it scared me off from even trying it. It says not to use within 2-3 days before going into a pool or hot tub, not to use before or during menstrating. I realize they have to protect themselves from liabilities but I returned it. I use a pool and hot tub often."
1,"expensive toy, not an epilator!","I had a 4 years old epilator of another brand and it was still perfect. Than I came to USA and I encountered with a plug problem so I decided to buy a new one instead of buying a voltage adaptor. I read all the reviews about all the epilators within this price range and I decided to buy this one.I am using this machine for more than 6 months now and I can easily say that the thing this machine does may be described by many things; but epilating is not one of them. you have to go over, over, over, over and over on the same area to get rid off hair (I don't know if i put enough 'over's!!!).Finally today I felt so frustrated in the shower after spending 30 minutes for underarms(it usually takes less than 5 minutes with my old epilator) and I used a razor.I can't imagine a worse epilator than this one.The only good thing about this machine; it does not give any pain, since it does not pull any hair!"
1,Huge waste of money!,"I bought this product thrilled with the thought that I could use an epilator in the shower. Even though that's possible, the very last thing this product does is remove hair -- at least with the epilator head. The shaving head works fairly well, but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better. I can't believe Panasonic thinks they'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective."
2,"This epilator does not work, it leaves your arms bumpy","I had great hopes when I received this epilator. It was meant to remove hair and go 2-3 weeks without shaving. First time you use it, epilating does hurt but is tolerable on low speed. What I found is it did not remove all hair from my arms. Worse still it left my arms bumpy for days. I ended up returning the product, I may try another brand - may be Braun."
3,Alright,"It is definitely better than shaving, and less costly than waxing, but this model kind of sucks. I have to go over the same spot five times to ensure all the hair is gone. Also, you can not use it while it is charging which is kind of stupid. The model I had before this one had a light attachment which was very useful"
3,MISSES A LOT,"I bought this product because it's a Panasonic and the price was good. However, it takes multiple passes in all directions and circular movements to get most of the hair. And it still misses. The battery life is only good for like 15 minutes or two body parts. It won't work while being plugged in, which is utterly stupid. I would guesstimate about 83% of the hair is being pulled from the roots. The rest are being torn off just above the surface. I should have spent more for an Emjoi."
2,One of the most ineffective products I've ever bought,"I tried using this product many ways under many different conditions, and it never, ever gave me the ""4-week sleek!"" of its advertising. No matter how much time I spent or the quality of the lighting or how I prepared my skin, I always find patches of uncleared hair mere hours later. I'm not talking about tiny stubble, but hairs that are several millimeters long. If I can grab said hair with my fingernails and pull them, there's no reason this device should have missed them.The only reason I gave this thing two stars is that it is eminently portable and de-links shaving from a water source."
1,Spend the $20.00 and go to your local spa.,This product is definitely overpriced. Awkward when using under the arms. Have to continuously go over the same area and does not grab very fine hair.
1,Faulty product,This item had trouble charging from the moment we recieved it. We opened it up to find a fried circuitboard between the connection to the cable and the battery.
2,I will not suggest this model,This is not working as expected.We used once and stopped using this.Our need is not survived.I will not recommend this model to any one.
1,"once used, now collects dust","I bought this for my wife because she is always complaining of having to shave often. Did some research, and discovered an epilator can do the job much cleaner. She tried it on one leg, and it hurt like hell. She tried it on the other leg in the shower, and it died on her, which was quite upsetting. One week after, the hair began to grow back, except every single one was ingrown. That was 1 year ago. Since then, she has happily returned to the razor. Last week, i bought her MicroForce by ShavePro,Microforce Wet Dry Shaver As Seen On TV., and she loves it! After shaving her legs, she uses this product to touch up everyday afterwards. Saves on the life of disposable razors, and the hassle of shaving often."
4,Ok for electric.,"I bought this looking for something that would help me with convenient shaving. I cannot use regular razors because my skin is sensitive and will itch incessantly after shaving. The problem I have with the razor is that it doesn't give me a really close shave and doesn't work well will my under arms either. However, I do like that I can take it wherever and shave quickly. When I used it in the shower it doesn't do as good of a job as just dry shaving.The epilator part I have tried only once and in a small area, because the directions state that it shouldn't be used during pregnancy (probably due to increased sensitivity). It seemed to work for the most part but left some areas with hair. However, the instructions clearly state how long the hair should be and that it may need to be used twice to get all of the hair since it grows at different paces. I look forward to trying it again after my pregnancy."
3,Do not buy this!,"Please try to find another better option before you decide to buy this epilator. This my second one and the first was so much better. The first one was a Philips Norelco Satinelle Ice, I didnt find this anymore.I'm sure you'll feel frustrated if you choose this."
3,Ouch,"I bought this for the depilatory aspect, OUCH-this hurts pretty badly (or maybe I'm just a weeny) but its does the job. I use this for my legs-doesn't hurt so bad here and underarms- hurts soo bad here but I am happy with my results. I have not gotten used to the pain but I enjoy not have to shave my underarms or legs for weeks at a time. Takes a while to do my legs cause of the ratio between number of tweezing heads to the amount of leg hair on my legs and it doesn't get every hair but its very nice and I'm glad I bought it. Its also pretty loud, even on the lower of the two speeds. I didn't use it for two months after I bought it cause the noise alone scared the beeswax out of meLegs: Works best after a shower- towel dry legs toUnderarms: Works best 24 hours after a shower to reduce pinching- I also would recommend trying to hold skin taught (which is quite difficult) but the pinching part HURTS!!! Again it works but buyer beware"
1,Only the trimmer is good,I have previously used a dry epilator and thought of buying a wet one thinking it'll be less painfull. I was not at all happy with thte performance as it doesn't pull much hair. I used soap/ shampoo as suggested but to no avail. I do like the trimmer and uses it to trim my husband hair on back of his neck.Overall if you are looking for an epilator- this one not good.
2,"Okay, while it worked","It worked great on the legs - while it worked. But after just a couple of months of, honestly, not even that much use, the battery stopped recharging fully. Unlike a previous epilator I'd had, this one can't be used while it is recharging, so that's a real nuisance. It won't even last long enough to get half of one leg done!I never tried using it in the water, so I can't say how it would have worked there. I cleaned it out quite thoroughly, so there's no way it is jammed or anything like that. I don't have heavy hair growth, either - I've waxed or epilated enough in the past that there's just not that much hair there any more.I will NOT be trying another Panasonic in the future, and I would recommend that others stay away from this brand, as well. Obviously, this is a case of ""you get what you pay for."""
2,Does not work for thin hair,"No matter how closely you follow the directions, it just doesn't work for all hair types. I bought this thinking it would be cool to not have to deal with stubble anymore, but it just does not work with my hair type. Not only does it hurt.. A LOT! It doesn't pull out my hair. It breaks it off near the skin. I then didn't even get the 'smooth' stage before I had stubble.It works for thicker hair, but if you have really thin hair like I do.. I don't recommend this."
3,Works Good,"I like the shaver except that in the advertisement for it, it says you can use it with the cord provided making it sound as though you could use it while plugged in. Well, you can't - the cord is only for recharging. I can only get about 3 to 3 1/2 shavings from it before it ""dies"". If you could plug it in and recharge it while you are using it, you wouldn't have to wait the 12 hours for recharge.Other than that, it works great and is convenient because its cordless and therefore travel ready."
2,Don't buy if you are not forced!,It doesn't work very well. I don't have 30 minutes to shave my legs. It does a terrible job and you have to go over and over the hair before it pulls it out. I've had it for 2 months so far and even let the hair grow out 1/4 inch and still no luck. I've also used it wet and had to spend too much time getting the water out of it.
2,Not good..,"I've returned my Panasonic ES2045P Epilator.. it was just not good at all! I had to rub it several times on my skin to pull out the hair, there were certain hairs that it just did not pull out at all! I do not reccomend it to anyone! I bought another Epilator from Braun and I really like it! So if you are going to spend your money, spend it well!! The only good thing about the Panasonic Epilator is that it does not hurt as much as others.. but maybe this is only because it does not pull out the hair that way it was supposed to..oh well!"
2,Not good for sensitive skin,"I am very pale and have very sensitive skin. Using the epilator even with lather was insanely painful and caused blood blisters from pulling out the hair. What's the point in removing the hair if you are breaking out in rashes and blood blisters?? I also found that it didn't grab the hair very well at all, so it's a lot of pain and frustration for almost no hair removal."
2,Too much work for something that is meant to make life easier.,"I returned this epilator. I've been waxing for years but am tired of the effort & mess of at home waxing, and the expense of salon waxing. But maybe I'm spoiled and my expectations are too high. This was my first epilator. I chose this one for the wet/dry. I tried the epilator head in shower, out of shower, after shower, with soap, dry... just never got results I would expect for a device that is supposed to make my life easier. Why should I have to try so hard? I read the directions carefully, tried to get the soap exactly the consistency they recommend... and I didn't think the trimmer or shaver were that great. I have a beard trimmer I use for my bikini line which was only ten bucks which works better. I have very fine hair, so maybe epilators can't grab it. I don't know... back to waxing."
3,"Not as good as my Emjoi, but great can use in shower","It works OK & from what I can tell it works best with soap lather rather than dry. I do think my Emjoi does a better job, but it's great to have one for in the shower. I haven't tried the regular razor yet. I do think it was worth the money."
4,very happy with product,"I'd never used an epilator before but thought I'd give it a shot. I got it primarily for the bikini area -- was never happy with the results from shaving or using lotions, and waxing just seemed too bothersome and expensive. I have to say it hurt like hell the first time (I had not ever waxed before), but the results have been great. No ugly bumps or razor burn. I love that I can use it in the shower (though it is kind of slippery when wet ... a rubberized handle would be a nice design improvement) and it is very easy to clean. I've been using it for touch ups every three to four days and I've found that once you are in ""maintenance mode"" the process is not uncomfortable at all. I am now using it for legs, bikini and underarms. Previous people have posted about exfoliating to avoid ingrown hairs -- I've been doing that frequently and it really does help.Let's face it...all this grooming is a pain. But short of going ""au naturel"" this is the best solution I've found."
4,It works great!,"Haven't tried in Wet, but overall, it does it's job. But, being that it's epilator, when the hairs are just growing slightly, obviously you'll have to resort to shaving or waxing. Can't be a miracle device. Anyway, the battery last about 30 min on full charge, and can't turn on while the charger plug is connected. Bummer if you just want to use it in dry environment only."
3,Works well,"This epilator works well, but you'll need to pass the same area a few times before you get all hair removed so it's a little time consuming. I used to have an epilady and after 7 years it died on me I wish I still had the old one it worked better than this new one. Oh well, this one works well but improvements could be made to the design."
1,Won't hold a charge - can't be used while plugged in and charging,"I received this less than a year ago and loved it after some painful conditioning of my legs to withstand the use of an epilator. It doesn't grab hair as easily as I would like, therefore it would take me a good hour to 45 minutes of using the epilator to achieve decent results. Even then, there were many leftover hairs. This is NOT good for grabbing small hairs, either. The worst part about this is that the battery dries up quickly, and you cannot use the epilator while it is plugged in, and charging! This was also my first epilator. Now I see why it may be beneficial to spend the extra money on a high end model."
3,best used in the shower,"Having used this epilator in and out of the shower now, I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed with it's performance outside of the shower. It seems to only work half as well and as fast used as dry as it does when used with soap and water.That being said, it does an excellent job when used wet. I've even been able to stand using it on my underarms and more intimate areas with minimum pain - and believe me, I've used an epilator dry in those areas before and it hurt like a son of a gun!I'm not sure that I'd buy this particular item again, but it worth the money I did spend on it."
2,Not meeting expectations,"Does not grip hair well, ended up buying the silk epil again. I only used it in the dry. Overall the length of the head is too narrow, not efficient."
5,It's the full package!,"My first epilator was the original Epilady. I loved it to death, literally. I used it so much that it finally just gave out on me. At the time, I couldn't afford a new machine. I recently got back to being able to afford a few luxuries. So, I started researching the latest in epilators. Wow! I had no idea this type of product had gotten so diverse.I chose the Panasonic Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epliator with Three Heads (actually just two, but an attachment gives one of the heads dual functionality) because of the multi-functionality it offers. Boy does it deliver! Not only do I have the choice of using it while my skin is dry (great for a quick touch up) or wet (very helpful for epilation), but I can also shave, trim my bikini line or pluck out unwanted hairs. Given the way the old epilator felt, I'm very happy with this new one because I feel that the hair removal is much less painful.I highly recommend this product."
2,Very disappointed in this product,"I am very disappointed at how little hair it grabs when going over the area, I have had to go over my legs and armpits several times and I still am missing spots, this product was $30 more at Target so I decided to order it from here.Wish I could return because it sucks! I wish I would have invested in the Braun one or an epilady."
2,Epilator aspect AVERAGE!,"I use to epilate my legs all the time. My old one, which was Bruan, would do this fast and effectively, and actually remove the hair! This one took me AGES, and has a very narrow head...making it even slower. My leg hairs have also become ingrown. If you are looking for a bikini trimmer/razor than this product is good, but I wanted it to work as an epilator first and foremost...THEN as a bonus, be a trimmer/razor."
2,very disappointing,simply did not remove all the hair effectively. i read those instructions and tried multiple tactics and this simply did not work for me. my legs have straight hairs that are fine - didn't remove. my underarms have thick curly hair - did not remove. i gave it two stars because the trimmer worked very well but i bought it to save $$ on waxing. the epilating part was terrible.
2,not what I expected,"I like the waterproof feature and the good battery life. but i was looking more for an epilator, the rest was a plus, and the epilator function is not very good. It breaks the hair and does not pull all af them."
3,Works Reasonably Well,"I've had this for a few months now and it works reasonably well. For me, it works great on my legs. When you turn it on it sounds really scary but once you suck it up and put it to use it's really not so bad. It hurts more for longer hairs (like arm hairs) so think about trimming those first (but it's more work). I really bought it for my underarms since shaving only makes hairs coarser and hand plucking is so tedious but I have to say that it really doesn't work for my underarms. I tried it in the shower with lather, too, but it doesn't seem to grab anything. I even tried to pull my skin taut but still no luck. So if you'll use it primarily for your legs then go for it but if you're planning on using it on other parts of your body, you might want to rethink this product."
2,I Hate It,"I don't know who came up with epi-anything, maybe it's because my hairs are so deeply rooted in my skin that it's medieval torture to pull them out. I tried it on my chin, really soapy with warm water and I could feel the little metal things grinding against my face like I was plowing a field. The worst ingrown hairs, ever, came back. Nightmare.Not good on my legs, either, even wet in the shower. The shaver attachment all right, it holds a charge nicely, nice that you can use it in the shower, so for that I give it 2 stars. But other than that - ouch. OUUUCCHHH."
1,"Not impressed, but limited experience with others","I have been epilating for about 10 years, and was using a Remington Ice epilator. When it finally died a sad (but well deserved) death, I went looking for a replacement. I read these reviews, and was fascinated with the whole wet/dry/cordless thing. Well, it may hurt less when wet (which wasn't the problem as I am used to and expected the pain), but I won't bother as it doesn't pull out the hair! I had to go over the same area over and over for it to catch the hairs. I am not expecting perfection, but I expected some improvement after ten years, and it was far worse than my (sniff) old epilator. I used to be able to do both legs in about 20 minutes. I just spent about 30, and still have a significant amount of hair on my legs."
2,not so good,I love epilating but this one missed a lot of hair and was slow not like others that I've tried. I will be buying a dif one.
5,pretty awesome,"this book is definately quite ""handy."" A strange adjective to describe a condensed biology reference book, but it fits. The layout consists of bold questions with answers that are concise and pertinant. Its essentially a college bio textbook in a Q and A format."
2,Questionable Performance,"I have this monitor came bundled with my computer. On paper, all the spects are pretty impressive for the price. However, there are mysterious times when all texts and images will have a ghost shadow behind it. They eventually go away, but I don't know how I fixed the problem? It may just be a simple matter of adjusting the settings, but I have owned quite a few computers and I have NEVER encountered such problems. All the other monitors I owned just worked right out of the box and I never bothered with them for the life of my PC. Even when it's working, I am not impressed with the image quality. The difference is huge between this screen and the screen of my wife's iBook. I can't complain since it came free with the computer. But I would probably will not spend my own money on this one. Unless price is your only consideration."
5,Cute Story,This is a great story telling how the girl's hat becomes decorated. Once again the illustrations are fantastic. The author once again tells a great tale.
2,out of balance,The gyroscope was out of balance and wobbled a great deal. The wheel was not parallel to the horizontal frame. Will never buy from this company again.
1,"Disappointing, not worth the money","Shipping was good, and packaging was intact, however the gyroscope arrived broken. The circular metal arm was broken / not welded. I did spin it once to see if that would affect it, and it chattered and vibrated out of balance. Bad quality assurance from this manufacturer. The metal finish also seemed to be flaking and looked very rough. On top of that, the clear plastic case that's pictured in the product description is not included. This came in a thin cardboard box.I'd recommend getting a different brand, regardless of how inexpensive this one is. I should've read the numerous reviews from people having the same issues. Don't waste your money or time with this one."
3,Fun as a desk toy,"This makes a great little desk toy. The string it ships with isn't that great, but you can get it do some basic gyroscopic tricks. I singed the ends of the string to prevent it from coming apart. Not for use in aeroplanes or industry."
2,Beware! Rough metal edges,"This gyroscope arrived completely boxed up like a new product, so when I opened it, I was surprised that it looked used! The metal parts had a dull unfinished look to it, the places where the metal was welded together (and even places that weren't welded together) had rough metal edges that could possibly cut someone. I quickly filed them off before giving the toy to my son.My son was super excited to get his gyroscope, so he didn't care about the details. After 3 times of spinning it, the inside portion popped out of the gyroscope. My son is a skinny 5-year-old, so it wasn't his super strength that pulled it out. The product just isn't well-made. Of course, he wanted me to fix it instead of return it, so that's what I've been doing since we purchased this item.Not pleased. We would return it except we lost the black base, and my son still likes it."
1,Cheap crap,"opened the box and metal ring was broke and not balanced very well at all so it doesn't keep a high enough rate of spin for long at all. not packaged like pictured which isn't a big deal i guess. over all I like gyros, but this particular one is super cheap and will probably disapoint you"
1,"Extremely poor build, badly-scratched up",This is the most poorly-built product I have ever purchased from Amazon. The picture on the product page does not do justice to its lousy quality. The paint is very badly-scratched up. The solder joints are all clearly visible. It looks like someone did this in his garage over the weekend and decided to put it up for sale. It is that bad. It literally looks like something you had picked out of the trash. This was meant to be a Christmas gift for my son. Luckily I had the chance to check it first. Do not buy this; you will regret having return it. Check out the photos I had shared.
1,Don't Buy Used,"I got the ""used"" one so that I could save a little money, and I got what I paid for the thing. The ring around the outside was bent before I even got it, so it doesn't work ideally. Probably an amazing toy brand new though."
5,gyroscope,"THis is a fun item, well made and seems will be durable. good for young as 5 years old. Easy to play with and is educational too. definetly recommend."
4,"shipped out fast, was in good conditions","my son is having fun with it. He's way into science. He loves to watch it spin on a string, or out to the side. It is fascinating to watch it in action."
2,Disappointing quality,"I remember these gyroscopes when I was young, but this doesn't measure up. The axle is loose and off-centered, causing it to vibrate while spinning. It does not remain spinning for long, and will not do most of the 'tricks' that it should be able to. I guess you get what you pay for. I'll be looking for a higher-quality item."
2,"Interesting, but poorly done","An interesting toy, but very poorly done. The paint is poorly made and the solder joints are all visible. You can see the metal burned in the joints. And it's not balanced well. It vibrates a lot when is spinning, that makes him stop quickly."
1,Big letdown,"I bought this as a desk toy for work. I received it quickly with two day shipping, but I was very disappointed when I saw the condition it arrived in. Just like many of the other reviewer mentioned, it was poorly manufactured with the soldering flaking off and a worn-out finish that makes you feel like your playing with a toy that is actually from 90 years ago.Pros: I looks like the picture (structurally)- It arrived quickly (thanks to Amazon)- I can return it easily (thanks again to Amazon)- Can be used as a paper weightCons: Poorly assembled- Used, hand-me-down condition (maybe it's supposed to look ""vintage"")- Not well balanced- Poor performance (due to a combination of flaws)"
2,"Works, but not high quality.","If you wind it perfectly and yank it like a son-of-a-gun, it will behave as expected, but even then, not for long. A drop of oil helped a bit, but I couldn't get it to do much of anything it was supposed to. It would stay upright on my finger for a little while, but on the stand, it just started wobbling and fell off. Would not stay vertical for long, and not horizontal at all. An interesting toy, but wasn't able to ""wow"" the kids because it just can't get spinning fast enough to do the fun stuff. Disappointing."
1,fell apart the first day,I ordered this for my students to look and and the first person to look at it tried to use it and it fell apart.....I guess you get what you pay for cheap price cheap product
5,awwaome,great i got it and it fine fun and cool levituon great toy the perfect toy for kids did not breack at all
2,Gyroscope,This item Is fun however it is not very durable. The string used to work the gyroscope frayed after 2 uses. Very disappointing.
3,Okay product,This is an okay toy. There really isn't an instruction manual at all so you don't know what you can really do with it. The string on it breaks like crazy. Not as fun and durable as I had hoped. If you have a few bucks to waste on just to show how a gyroscope works go for it.
2,Poor choice,"I should have listened to the reviews, 10 bucks for a piece of junk. It does not work well, it vibrates a lot making it much less efficient in spinning. I would not recommend this toy unless you want it just for looks."
2,fun while it lasts,"I bought this for my 10 year old brother - he had lots of fun with it - for the 5 minutes that it stayed together. the main ring has a gap and after a couple of spins it loosens and the inner part flies out almost every time - very disappointing. He never even got a chance to get the hang of it, never mind get to do all the cool tricks. I remember I got a gyroscope at around the same age - it lasted for years, until I lost it. In the end this was a big let down!"
2,TEDCO Gyroscope,Works but is made from light (cheap) metal and does not spin long. The gyro fell out on the third pull. My recommendaiton is spend a few more bucks and get a good one.
1,"good toy, but poor quality","It's good when it works, but it's not good quality, so it isn't perfectly balanced. That said, it doesn't stay spinning long and it doesn't perform like a good gyroscope. String to wind it is pretty cheap quality too."
1,I want a refund or a new one,"The order itself arrived very timely and no concerns with that. It was immediately wrapped to give as a gift for Christmas and upon opening it and attempting to use it, it broke. We didn't even get to see how it works. :("
4,Still can improve in friction,"I was trying to use it to explain that angular momentum conserves and the change of the seasons to my 1st grader.But I failed to. because it is too hard for them without vector, force concept. Toy is just a toy.... Its science shouldbe OK for 8th grader or older."
4,Gyroscope,"The gyroscope is fine but come with a rather short string that prevents attaining its full rotational speed. Gyroscope spins well with little friction, but if you drop it, it can break into its components. Fortunately, when this happened, it was easy to put back together."
1,Very cheap version of great toy.,Very disappointing... the gyro was not balanced.not smooth spin.. slowed quickly because of friction gyro touching post and the outer rim (gimbal) broke day 1 after 5 used -- no falls... I think Duncan's is the best bet.
2,Not well built...,Received it today. Looks like cheaply built or may be used (can't tell). Finish is rough with scratches and what not... even the plastic box has marks and scratches! I can live with that... what I can not live with is that it is not balanced well...It may come down to your luck in drawing a bad piece... but shouldn't be. That is what simple quality check should catch. It spins and holds the spin for reasonable time but the wheel is not balanced so the gyroscope quickly goes into increasing precession... making it not much fun. Not too happy buying this product from this seller (Village Toys). Either the product is bad or the seller sold me a used/returned product. Either way... this was a waste of money :(
4,A Fun Toy,"I bought this toy because I saw a video on youtube of a gyroscope never failing to fall. Balancing on a string, on a pen cap, and even put on a string sideways. This toy is a little cheaper than the one on the video I saw. The balancing is not quite as spectacular as the one on the video and it is a little stiff on the rotations. But, for this price it does provide quite a bit of enjoyment. It can balance on a string and a pen cap, but not for a long time as scene on the the video. Sometimes it can correct itself when it is put sideways, but not all the time. Overall, I do like this product for its price and I would recommend it. Enjoy!"
4,Very Nice,My boys really enjoyed this product. My husband had one when he was young and wanted the boys to have one too.
2,Cheaply made,Balance wheel was not as heavy as the older ones. Doesn't spin long enough. String was too short.. It would not perform as advertised. I would not reccomend this to anyone.I have bought many things from Amazon and this and the slinky are only two things that I have beern dissappointed with.
1,Cheap,"The gyroscope lasted about an hour before the small metal piece holding the axis in place broke, making the toy useless and unfixable. Would never reccomend, total waste of money"
4,cool toy,This is a cool toy for anyone who's into science. This item came a week early! It's also really great for little kids to play with.
5,"""Canvas of Dreams"" a must-have CD","This album is a gift to the listener of lovingly crafted, beautiful songs. It is also an insight into the tremendous spirit of Tracy Stark, who wrote all of the songs, sings lead vocals, executive produced the album, and even played piano on a few of the tunes. Classically trained, Ms. Stark's skills are as solid as can be. But her forte (no pun intended) is clearly as a singer/songwriter. From the bluesy, dreamy feel of ""Good Life,"" to the more upbeat sound of ""Movin' On"" and ""You Were There,"" to the ethereal notes of ""Dreams,"" Ms. Stark captures a mood, articulates a feeling, and touches the heart. These are wonderful songs, superbly arranged and lovingly presented to the listener. For anyone who appreciates good music, this CD is a must-have in your collection. Buy it!!!! You won't be disappointed."
2,blah,this band i thought was a christian band. turns out no they are not! i'm sticking to christian metal bye!
2,A compilation/ cardio workout,"This is a cardio workout from a physical trainer/bellydancer using bellydance as the fundamentals.The warm up segment is pilates and not too complicated. The 4 level breathing technique is interesting and taught well.Some yoga poses are included. Undulating traveling steps were fun to do. Some steps as the Turkish 2 step are repeated too much. Cool down seems a bit too much like a second workout. The studio setting is good, the trainer pleasant just a bit unconnected with her viewer- moving too fast appearing more like a physical trainer than a dancer, but then is that so bad for a cardio workout? Overall this seems to be a compilation of bellydance,pilates, yoga. There is a nice performance at the end by the trainer herself. The music is great by Gypsy Caravan, Jehan, Knossos."
4,Fun fast workout,Being relatively new to belly dancing I found some of the moves a bit hard to follow and was not sure if I was using correct form. I did have fun at first and think it was a wonderful workout but towards the end I had a hard time catching up with Melissa as I was concentrating on the moves rather then the pace she was going. I will use this workout again but not until I have a understanding of the dance itself with some more practice using a beginning belly dance DVDs.
2,"Okay for a decent sweat, but not the greatest","After taking a belly dancing class at my gym I decided to purchase this DVD. It claimed to give a good cardio workout (which is what I was looking for). Although it did make me work up a bit of a sweat (a 5-6 on a scale of 1-10), I found it to be a bit boring and thought that the instructor was going a bit too fast after showing the ""steps"" only a couple of time. I have used the DVD only twice and honestly doubt that I will use it again. There was no nice background or others participating in the DVD and I would not recommend this. I would rather go to my gym and have others around which make it fun (even if you do not know all the steps), it's all about the moving and keeping up a cardio routine, and since I was bored with one woman just belly dancing and hearing her monotonous tone (and everything she was saying had been pre-recorded so she was dancing and her lips were not moving.... too wierd)."
3,"Pretty, experimental loathing","With the usual songwriting skills by Tim Kasher of Cursive, his solo outing does at times feel a bit vapid, but only in those few moments where he gave himself too much drum beat space to deal with effectively, or when he stays too much in love with his own vocal misery..For the most part the album is tight, get this if you want your Postal Service with a little more grit..."
5,Enjoyable and funny,"This is a fun book of photos by a man with a keen eye. Many of the pics are gut-busting hilarious.The theme is religion but there is nothing here to offend the religious. I highly recommend Churches Ad Hoc: A Divine Comedy to every one.--Guy P. Harrison, author ofRace and Reality: What Everyone Should Know About Our Biological Diversityand50 Reasons People Give for Believing in a God"
3,"Should be called ""Raising VEGAN Children""","I was very disappointed in this book b/c it really is written for vegan children, not ovo-lacto vegetarians. So to me, this book was pretty useless. The concentration was on how to get the needed nutrition without meat or dairy. It is much easier to get what you need on an ovo-lacto diet, but there was really almost NO info on this in the book. I feel that the book description and reviews have been very misleading.In any case, if you are vegan, this book would be great for you."
1,So disappointed... Not at all what we need,"We a wanted nutritional help-mate for raising our vegetarian baby. Despite the title, this is a strictly vegan (no dairy, eggs, honey, etc...) bible that suggests a baby begin eating a soy-filled diet at 9 months, and processed soy-foods such as soy yogurt as early as 7 months! The book is preachy and filled with less than helpful tidbits - such as suggesting your child could develop diseases like Crohns if he/she eats dairy."
3,This should be called Raising Vegan Children,"I have nothing against being vegan, my husband is vegan. But this book is a vegan book with vegetarian adjustments. It's simply not what I ordered and expected."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"Imagine how disappointed I was to see a meal recipe that said to put a veggie burger on a bun......that's not really what I call cooking. Granted this isn't a cookbook, but even the ideas for explaining vegetarianism to your children were lacking in originality (tell them we don't eat animals). If I had skimmed through this in a bookstore prior to purchasing it online, I'd not have bought it."
5,In Your Face Greatness,"This book was a surprising piece of pure gold. The beginning starts out with a description and back story that Lynda manages to make not boring of which other novels make you yawn and put it down; you still feel like turning that page and continuing. Jump to the future/present and you're immediately introduced to fascinating characters that you begin to connect with. The technological terms used throughout the novel really lend to it's believability; showing that knowing your stuff and doing the research really does raise your writing above others. I love the nonchalant way that she talk about sex in this book, like it's not a big deal; which it's not! It's very adult, very good, and overall just an amazing read. Highly recommended!"
4,A very enjoyable read,This is one of the first science fiction that I have read and I found it very enjoyable and difficult to put down. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.
4,GREAT REFERENCE!E,PASTURE MANAGEMENT IS A HECK OF ALOT MORE COMPLICATED THAN THROWING SOME SEED ON THE GROUND. THERE IS A WHOLE DYNAMIC THAT YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF AND I THOUGHT THIS BOOK HELPED ME UNDERSTAND THE PROPER STEPS TO TAKE TO START AND MAINTAIN MY OWN PASTURE. VERY GOOD INFORMATION.
3,Exelente libro para el manejo del pastoreo,"Una muy completa y acertada visión del ecosistema pastizal y su profunda relación con una alta y sustentable productividad, contiene mucho conocimiento practico de como son las cosas en el campo."
2,no parece vives...lamentablemente,"me encanta la musica de vives. De sus trabajos , esta es la excepcion. Aqui no encontramos ni el ritmo,ni el espiritu de la musica que lo caracteriza, y el resultado es un cd totalmente obviable, que no aporta nada a la notables producciones de este interprete.( afortunadamente retoma su mejor estilo en el siguiente el amor de mi tierra"
3,Why I did not buy,"I tried some of the samples on Amazon and decided not to buy.My wife and I are HUGE fans of this Colombian, but the songs seem somber and apologetic . . . Sure Carlos Vives has his share of issues, however - pouring the positive things in his life and driving the music may be a better way of showcasing his superior talent . . . (Instead of allowing Fonseca to copy his style, at times.) Bring back the old Carlos Vives por Dios!"
2,disappointing,"I went in search of Vives' disks after realizing that he was the singer of La Gota Fria (which apparently is no longer available). I'm a big fan of Cuban music, and I'm just getting into some Columbian. Though I liked a few of these songs, they are too ""pop"" for my tastes. Some even bordered on the cheesy. I don't mean anything against Vives since his other disks have been better, but I really am not very fond of this CD."
2,Ok prep but,"Would probably not have purchased this except the class required it. I thought the ""Rad Review Easy"" online was much better. radrevieweasy""dot""com"
5,The best explanations of principles.,"It's not a good idea to spend time memorizing answers to questions. It is in your best interest to know the principles behind the answers, if you plan on passing the registry. This book is a fine condensed version of your 2 year program."
3,Is it my luck?,"The phone has a lot of features, slick design and other extras that other phones dont. However, unfortunately I never had a chance to use it, since it arrived defective. The battery would not charge at all. I had to return it for a refund. I dont think I am going to consider buying another Siemens phone again. I would rate their customer service support 7 on the rate from 1-10 with 10 being the best."
5,One of my favorite all-time movies,"The actors and Carole King soundtrack are great. A lovely film that takes you back not that long ago when things were simpler. I see someone saying there isn't much of a script. Well, that's life. This movie was well ahead of its time as a slice-of-life film."
2,Beyond boring,How do you take two great actors as leads and still make one of the most boring movies I've ever seen? Why would you do that? I'd say more but that would give away the alleged plot.
3,Not a winner,"Even diehard Paul Newman (or Lee Marvin) fans might have a hard time getting through this one. They play a couple of oafish cowboys trying to get a herd of horses from Mexico into Texas; neither has a clue what he's doing. A parody of the tough-guy western, Newman is the not-very-swift though good-hearted and determined schlemiel, while Marvin is the con-man who bungles everything. Newman is occasionally funny, but Marvin is merely surly. Stuart Rosenberg's direction is very loose, and often there seems to be no direction at all. Even at a relatively short 100 minutes the movie seems to go on forever. The best thing about the movie is the music by Alex North. Not a career enhancer for either principal actor."
1,Unconvincing and disappointing plots,"The only reason I finished this book is hoping there might be an interesting and surprising ending that makes sense for all the previous, disjointed threads -- the desirable daughters' high life in india, the attempted extortion/murder, the shady life Didi lead, etc. The ending is more disappointing than the plots lead to it, and makes even less sense.The characters and their life seem to be ""made up"", inconsistent and unconvincing. For example, Didi's life is portrayed as an indian ""diva"" among the affluent Indian American community, but she is practically a sales girl for the jewlers and apperal merchants. I also don't see the echoing between the life of modern day Tara and the ancient tree-bride Tara, yet the author seems to place an emphasize on strong boundage between the two Tara's.It is just a very strange book."
3,Lifestyles of the Rich and Xenophobic,Read this book if you:1. Want to understand why the expatriate Brahmin community is so closed;2. Are an American man chasing a Brahmin woman and can't figure out why it's not working; or3. You're an expatriate Brahmin woman and you want to know why your American acquaintances think you're so difficult.The author's language is relatively laconic rather than lyrical or profound and the plot is banal. Don't look for philosophical insights or subtle twists of manner. This is more soap opera than Austen.
4,A new view,Mukherjee does for Indian literature what RG Verma has done for Indian film. Hurray at last is all I can say.
1,Poorly written,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. In a time when young Indian authors are showcasing their literary talents, this was a major setback. Characters are superficial, dialogue was immature and the story was unbelievably contrived and silly. It was chosen as our book club selection and 7 out of 7 rated this as one of the worst books we've ever read in our 8 years of book club. I'm still trying to figure out what Ms. Mukherjee and the publishers were thinking when she allowed this to be published. If you're interested in this genre of books, read Rohint Mistry, Mohsin Hamid, Arundhati Roy. They are amazing storytellers!"
1,Oversold,"This book, reviewed TWICE by the New York Times, was a stunning disappointment. Ms Mukherjee writes as though caught in the early twentieth century-producing pages of plodding, repetitive descriptions, and emphatic references to character traits without ever showing those traits in motion. This book seems to want to attach itself to current fashionable writing, with its themes of Silicon Valley wealth and the son-who-turns-out-to-be-gay, and there's nothing wrong with writing about what people are interested in, but give me a break!! This is a first draft of something that might have become quite interesting if the narrator were more self-reflective, less a stick figure. I would take anything written by Chitra Divakaruni over this book any day."
3,Disappointing,"As other reviews make very clear, this is a novel about cultural displacement, not knowing where one fits in. The premise is interesting and I think the novel is culturally instructive. While I felt excited at the opening of the novel, my enthusiasm waned about halfway through, due to the wooden characterization. I very much wanted to feel sympathy, or liking for the characters, but I could not. It isn't that I wanted them to be ""nice"", but that I wanted them to be fuller, more psychologically real. The internal plight of the main character, Tara, simply did not come through. In the end, the cultural instruction for me failed somewhat as a result. If you are looking for cultural analysis, a sketch of the Indian community in America, you may enjoy this. If you are looking to gain deeper psychological insights about cultural displacement, alienation etc., I would suggest looking elsewhere.While I admire the work, I was not moved by it, and I found it a chore to finish."
3,Just can't get hooked,"I am the kind of reader who likes to finish things I start and, while this book has enough of a plot to make it worth finishing to find the resolution, I've had a hard time getting sucked in by it. The characters aren't built deeply enough to really feel committed to them. I agree with the other reviewers that the plot has lots of interesting topics regarding immigration and culture but really should have focused on one or two to be much stronger."
2,So - so,"Indian writers, especially women, seem to be all the rage now. I've read several of Ms. Mukhergee's books, and she seems like a very interesting person that I would like to sit and talk with but her books are not that great. This book seems another 'Jasmine' in a way, what with the 'American experience', relationships ending, bombs going off. Maybe it's me but I did not follow the significance of the girl marrying the tree or whatever. I was disappointed. If anyone wants a great Indian novel read 'Train to Pakistan' by Khushwant Singh."
2,An unworthy read,"I picked up this novel in the bargain book section and Im EVER so happy that I only paid five dollars for it. The book started out intrestingly enough yet about 1/3 I just wanted it to be over! I kept reading because I was hoping the quality of writing would improve and by the end of the novel I was disappointed that I stuck it out and finished.The plot left much to be desired, and was hard to follow at times. There seemed to be no clear resolution to any conflict and random ideas were thrown in haprazordly. However, the description of Bengali life and social status was portrayed accurately and some characters(such as Rabi, the narrators son, was three dimensional). All in all, I could have found a much better book to read on a lazy Sunday afternoon- Dont waste your time on this novel."
1,Desirable Daughters,Book was in very poor condition. If I order one than one book from the same place at the same time I don't think I should have to pay double postage and handling.
2,THIS CARTRIDGE LEAKS,"Unlike genuine Cannon ink cartridges, these have a piece of tape on top that you are supposed to remove to open a tiny air hole. Beware when you do this because the cartridge will start to leak. The cartridge is also shaped slightly differently (a little shorter), but still seems to fit. Once it's inserted into the printer, it seems to work ok, at least for general printing, but I wouldn't even attempt to print on photo paper and expect a good quality print. Next time, I'll spend the extra $ for an OEM cartridge. If you want to save $$, I'd rather use replacement ink bottles and refill the original Cannon cartridges (which I've done before)."
3,Memories of a Cultural Titan,"Steiner's intellectual memoir may be a treat for some, and a tremendous bore for others. While it is clear that his cultural and intellectual stature is extraordinary, there is something nevertheless boorish about the way he summons great figures from the arts as evidence of his eruditions. Sentences like ""It may be that too much of my father's ""library,"" of his ""syllabus"" of the supreme and caustic certitude that in the face of a Homer, of a Goethe, of a Beethoven or a Rembrandt, the second-rate is precisely that, conditions and confines me still"" (174). And yet, there are passages in this little text that truly shine with curious brilliance-the way in which Steiner was fascinated with the infinity of Royal insignia's as a child is particularly striking, or his early accounts of life at the University of Chicago. All the same, his laborious records of various university achievements and coterie of famous intellects is mere pretense."
1,Doesn't fit 2001 hyundai tiburon.,"This harness doesn't fit the 2001 hyundai tiburon. Now that I have ripped open my girlfriend's dashboard and have seen the shape of the wiring harness I believe the correct harness is atStereo Wire Harness Hyundai Tiburon 97 98 99 01 02 (car radio wiring installation parts). It is hard to tell because the sellers all provide such low quality pictures of the connectors. It would be far more useful if the pictures showed some detail, like how many pins are inside the connector or how many blades. I already know that it is a plastic dongle with some wires coming out, that isn't a detail the manufacturers need to advertise."
2,Missing amp wire!,"I received this cable today only to find out it does not have all the wires! It is missing the amplifier control wire! Its the only wire not included. Really guys, I'll spend the extra $ to get what I need! If your not including every wire, say so!"
1,DID NOT FIT.,Bought this harness to install aftermarket cd player in 2008 KIA SPECTRA. DID NOT FIT. Waited 10 business days for this and was rolling on my installation until this harness didnt fit.
4,Does not fit Hyundai Sonata 06,"It does not fit Hyundai Sonata 06, this harness is to small for it so I had to return it.I think it would fit some KIAs. The quality is fine though."
1,Does Not work for KIA,I baught this for my 2009 Kia Spectra and this does not work. It only works for Hyundai's they need to remove the /Kia 99-Up from the description
1,item didn't work!!,The item doesn't fit a 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe!! I installed the unit myself and had to purchase a different wiring harness!! Waste of time and money!!
1,Does not fit 2000 Hyundai Elantra,"I ordered this for a 2000 Hyundai Elantra, and the connector is too large. Looking at MetraOnline, the source of the part, it looks like their 70-7300 is the correct part."
1,"Contact seller to make sure it fits for sure, the check compatibility thing doesnt work right apparently","contact the seller first to see if it fits your vehicle, does not fit a 2002 kia sedona, the ""check compatibility with your vehicle"" thing said it would, but it doesnt"
1,All Wrong !,"I ordered it and it showed up a week later. Then when I removed the stock radio, I found that the harness did not come close at all to fitting. With little free time, I took the loss ang hard wired the radio in."
4,fabulous little book,"This book tells the two real secrets that create good business writing, rule of thumb and writer's intuition. It also shares a very special secret in all good writing, how to avoid the rule-burdened mechanics-based approach that ruins most writers before they begin."
5,CONCISE WRITING TIPS THAT GET THE POINT ACROSS LOUD & CLEAR,"With time becoming more valuable each day, and email evolving as the convenient mode of communication, people tend to rush through common and simple memos and correspondence which can lead to bad writing habits and the potential for costly mistakes. Now that we have the technology to simplify communication, it's time to upgrade our own communication skills to avoid the pitfalls and re-focus upon what we're trying to say. Kevin Ryan not only gives us the tools to improve our writing but he introduces us to successful people who already have. I write back cover promotional pieces for a book publisher and I've cut hours from the amount of time it takes to create new, fresh and clear copy. Here's a book that's right for the times."
5,God Is Not In The Thesaurus,"I have had the pleasure of actually meeting and visitning with Bo. I don't think that there is a better representation of wonderful people in prison than Bo Cox. This book jerked tears from my soul. I have actually worked at Joseph Harp, the facility where Bo is currently housed. He stood by the tree outside the unit, often times with ""Jerry"" and always took the time to say, ""Good Morning"" as I walked by. This book is very, very true. It paints an extremely vivid picture of Bo's day-to-day life. Bo, I cannot wait to hear that you have been released from state custody. You and Deb deserve a great life, and I know that God has a plan for the both of you. Keep praying, smiling, and believing. God Bless You and Keep You."
2,Not the Best From the Dinah Series -- a review of Dinah 'Hide and Seek',"The Dinah series is meant as a primer for beginning readers. The pictures are simple and are there to give clues to children who are just beginning to find their way through text.In the case of this particular book, I think the pictures fail. They are supposed to show how Dinah gets so dirty that Doug (her dino friend) can't find her as they begin to play hide and seek. [ Unless you point that out, your child is unlikely to conclude this on their own. I had to read the cover to figure it out--lol]Two Stars. 8 pages plus cover. Simple, bright artwork. The sentences are perfect for beginning readers. This particular book isn't as funny as some in the series. Some text follows so you can judge the reading level for yourself.Dinah and Doug are friends.They swim in the water.They sit in the mud."
4,Great companion for an intro to phosilophy course,"This book greatly assists you in ""doing philosophy"" instead of simply reading it. It helped me prepare for class discussion by presenting me with many of the questions the professor was going to ask ahead of time. Several of the though experiments showed up on quizzes and tests. You'd do well to get this or Ultimate Questions: Thinking About Philosophy to help you ""do"" philosophy."
1,poorly made,My 4yr old son received this toy as a birthday present. Within 5 minutes of having it 2 of the trucks broke and one was missing screws. This toy is very poorly made and severly over priced! I would not recommend this toy to anybody.
1,the pot calling the kettle black,"Sorry, I don't see this as heterodox or controversial or even as an alternative to a traditional pedagogical approach. There is nothing objectionable or provoking about its theses in general, it's just that it gets its facts, big and little, wrong a significant amount of the time. Still, I'd cut it some slack and give it two stars, except that it constantly calls itself superior to other forms of instruction. (I can't imagine, by the way, what an accompaning CD could have on it that would be useful. I think we should let books be books, and if you aren't content with books, then don't read books.)On more thing: A scale is NOT centered on a root; a scale is centered on a TONIC. Chords have roots; scales do not have roots."
2,"Helps to uncover misconceptions, but horrible attitude.","I found this book to be helpful in uncovering misconceptions that we music educators may be teaching. The author had some problems understanding music as it was taught by his educators, and I can understand how he misunderstood AND how the teacher(s) may have misconstrued the concept. I think it's been helpful in how I approach teaching older beginning students, since their way of thinking is mostly formed and more difficult to change.I did not like the author's blatent bad attitude. The book is full of negative tone. The author probably should have gone through therapy to resolve his issues before writing his book. This book mangles musical concepts with sideways thinking. His explainations are more confusing than it would be to learn the concepts correctly, and are sometimes just plain incorrect."
2,not heresy,"I'm giving this a star more than I think it really deserves as a reward for being just a book, not a book plus CD or a book plus tape or a book plus video. I think it's sad that our society is steadily becoming less literate (and I don't think we can blame this on technological ""progress""--rather, it's a matter of intellectual laziness), but if you don't care for books, then don't read them; it isn't reasonable to fault books for being books.""Lies..."" is not ""heresy""; it's just muddled and confused. ""The music education establishment"" is a strawman and a red herring: no one feels threatened by ""Lies..."".This sentence, ""a scale is a group of notes centered on (above and below) a root note"", is particularly unfortunate because the terms ""root"" and ""tonic"" are commonly confused by beginning amateur pop musicians. Scales are categorically NOT ""centered"" on a root; they are centered on a TONIC. CHORDS, not scales, are built on a root."
4,self taught musician,"i've learned by ear most everything i know about music. chord theory, sight reading, etc has always bored me. this book was as exciting as anything i've ever read, fiction or non.i know infinitely more than i knew a week ago and i feel much more musical. this book is for people who really care about making music vs those who want to pose as elitists."
2,"This CD is ""asi asi/so-so"". Colombian radio music is better","This is not a review, but a question and a comment. Why isn't Spanish music grouped by country? It's difficult to find contemporary music from Colombia or Venezuela, for example, which isn't mixed up with some Mexican misclassification."
1,Memory Foam Pillows,"Sadly, I bought four memory-foam pillows that are not soft enough to sleep on -- they're too firm. I expected pillows that would mold to my head and provide a good night's sleep. I would definitely not recommend ordering these pillows."
3,Not too shabby,"I purchased this pillow as a gift, and it was quite well received! It is an extremely comfortable pillow, and the new foam smell does not linger too long. However, when I purchased the pillow I thought it would support the head and neck more than it does. It is still extremely comfortable, but if you like a lot of support you may want to use this with another pillow or look for something else. I am fairly pleased with it, and would certainly recommend it despite the support issue."
2,Summer Reading,This was summer reading for a grandchild. We read them together and discuss them. I do not know why this would have been chosen for summer reading. Can't see much redeeming value in it. Needs teacher-directed discussion in class.
4,As described,"I very good condition, no marks or writing. Took a week to receive but it was shipped in a timely manner. My step son will be enjoying his new summer read. Thank you."
4,"Questionable characterization, great plot","The characterization wasn't entirely convincing. I'm around kids that age a lot and sometimes, characters didn't sound or act like any 13 year olds I know. A few of the leaps of faith seemed sudden and without explanation.That said, the plot was thoroughly compelling. It was a new twist on a common theme, but with a fairly unexpected ending. Definitely worth a read."
3,"Good price, very large size","Price is nice, but the scent does not last as long as Curve that was purchased in a B&M store. It also smells slightly different, but still nice. This is a huge bottle, and will last a long time."
1,This Curve bought directly from(sold by AMAZON) Amazon is FAKE,"To my surprise, i found out that this is not an original Curve . I have a 3.4 ounce bottle that I've been using for several years now and this one from AMAZON is a diluted version of that. the smell only lasts a fraction of the original. At first i thought it was just me so i asked my parents, both of whom have bought or used Curve. They both agreed there was something wrong with it, especially with the strength of the smell(i had not told them it was fake at this point). As a result we came to unanimous conclusion. This Curve bought directly from Amazon is FAKE.I'm very disappointed especially since I've been their customer for over 4 years now."
3,not what I thought,"kinda flowery, thought it was more like cool water, its okey but not what I thoughtits okay but not what I expected, thought it would smell more like coolwater, since its blue, but its more flowery, tolerable"
2,There are better guides,The maps are horrible and the hotel and restaurant listings are inadequate. Buy another book instead.
3,fluff,"Ok...I will be the bad guy about this book. Fluff is the word that comes to mind. Shallow stereotpypical fluff. I have to admit to having fun reading it, but am embarrassed to say so. (I also admit to eating fast food but that is not something that I am proud of either.) It strikes me as the book one would expect a straight woman to write about gay culture. It just strikes me as obviously coming from the pen of someone who is not gay but who is trying overly hard to identify and be the best buddy of someone who is gay."
2,BREEDERS? Please!,"I wanted to like this book. I really did. I don't have any problem with crediting gay men with improving the tone of our culture, but my problem centered around how the rest of us fared in this lineup. Crimmins writes, ""Without the artful influence of gay men, our American landscape can seem like a wasteland, one giant Wal-Mart, or Disney World. Would I want my daily life to resemble a bad version of Superbowl Sunday?"" Crimmins may not know any heterosexual men who are sensitive and pleasant, but believe me, they're not all beer-swilling swine. Likewise, we women do not all need to take our dressing and decorating ideas from gay men. (She even says that gay men taught the rest of us how to have sex.) Although Crimmins would have to include herself among the ""breeders""-- she's pregnant in some scenes-- ""breeder"" remains a derogatory term. While this book amuses in part, I don't think I'd recommend it. Too many stereotypes."
1,Thought provoking??? Not.,"The only thought that entered my mind after making it halfway through this book is ""How in the hell did this unfunny, dull, rehash of gay tv trivia get published?"" Perhaps the title was meant to be clever or witty, but it is neither. It is however completely misleading, as the book is nothing more than a shallow recash of recent gay cultural history written as if the author has been sitting in front of the tube her entire life.Save your money. Nothing new here unless you've been living in a cave for the last 40 years."
2,Barely enough to warrant further examination,"Other then scoring the seldom creatively inspired music passage, the generically eclectic alternative unit seems content to wallow in it's derivative nature whilst heaping layer upon layer of mostly unneccesary instrumental filler and confusing that with progressive pop ambition. Whenever we are usually able to settle into a favorable groove, an ugly self-conscious experimentation will come rain on any ego-less beauty. When we see this eight piece band earnestly put all of their ideas together in favor of one all encompasing track, results pale to the majority of indulgent, inexperienced songwriting and patently, poorly produced, puny vocals that drag the disc down into stereotypical indieland."
4,out of left field,"This is a record I have listened to again and again. The name alone makes me want to hate it. But it seems to work perfectly at the end of the day. This is their first record. They come off as a Belle and Sebastian type group from Melbourne. They have been honing their unique sound for four years. They are like a school band with an assortment of instruments. They like to combine electronic sounds with great vocals and organic instruments and everyday noise, in songs like ""Imaginary Ordinary."" The song ""Scissor Paper Rock"" is more like the Swedish band Cinnamon. ""Like A Call"" is reminiscent of early Paul McCartney solo, post-Beatles, pre-Wings. This is a great musical band that seems to come out of nowhere every few years. Maybe this is the next Sigur Ros?"
4,Light and airy..,"I'm reviewing this album as it comes to it's third loop at 3:50 in the morning. It was given to me by a friend several hours ago.Most of all, i'd have to say that in my opinion, the majority's comparison to belle and sebastian seems a little extreme. i can see some threads of similarity, possibly in some of the production with horns, and the softness of the voices. some harmonic elements recall isobel's style, but otherwise, i wouldn't compare the two. if any comparison had to be made, i'd call them a softer, lighter, more structured Animal Collective.if you enjoy cleverly put together, quirky, airy music that makes you dance around in your headphones, you'll enjoy this."
3,"Not very sturdy, but looks nice","I agree with other reviews on here, the holes are not fully drilled deep enough to tighten the screws all the way. This leaves the rack kind of rickety and wobbly, luckily we are using it to hold a couple light blankets. If you try to muscle the screws tighter the cheap wrench they send with it strips, so make sure you have quality allen wrenches. The finish looks nice, and is more like a cherry color than walnut, which I like better."
4,LOVE IT,"I've been wanting a blanket rack for so long and decided to get this one... I love the cherry wood color and since we use a lighter blanket in the summer, and live in a town home, we were tired of folding up blankets and putting them away on a shelf..The ad calls the color antique walnut but to me it's more of a cherry color.My only downfall with this one is that it's just a little to big for my size room. The front legs being on a curve make the rack look much bigger than it actually is...My winter comforter on the rack makes the room so colorful and the price was right!"
2,Two pieces too long!,"I had to trim two middle posts so they would fit! Either the holes they go into were not routed out enough, or the posts themselves were a bit too long. Pain in the rear for the price. Otherwise it is a nice looking rack."
3,poor packaging,the quality of the product was acceptable but the packagingwas poor. both end frames were broke because the cross pieces were forced between them. I had to reglue both ends.
5,Beautiful & Quality,"Yes, the wood color is more similar to a cherry, it's a deep red/brown that looks great with our expresso furniture & honey colored floors. Yes, the screws are self-driving so they are really difficult to screw all the way in, past the prescrewed holes, but you get a very sturdy rack that isn't likely to come apart unless two strong men play tug-of-war with it!The only things I would recommend is having a non-slip mitt or something to help you when you're tightening the screws, and the two middle dowels don't have screws (once the top & bottom are secured there is no way it would come out) but if you don't want them to spin then just put a dab of woodglue in before you finish tightening everything.Really, this looks beautiful and I am so happy with the hard wood. This piece will last, and for $50 I can't ask for much more."
3,Needs work,The quilt / blanket stand is very nice and pretty once assembled. The pre-drilled holes are too small for the screws provided. I had to re-drill the holes to get the screws in. Shipping was good. The finished product is a 5-star. The assembly lowered it to a3-star.
2,Poorly Built and Finished,"If you are not a honeydo I recommend you honey dont buy this thing , Poorly made and finished I had to redrill all the holes , I had to sand and refinish in several places and even then some places on the wood were so choppy I could not repair . Looks descent after my repairs and does the job but for 60.00 you would think I would not have to practically build and finish myself !"
3,"OK, but hard to assemble",Seems sturdy enough once assembled. You have to hold a round spindle while you are turning the screw; holes were tight for the screws. Unlikely you can assemble with the Allen wrench provided - no leverage and edges quickly rounded. Don't order unless you have a real set of Allen wrenches handy.
5,If you have a mandoline slicer you need this glove,"For safety's sake, this glove is a must with a madoline food slicer. It is durable, made very well and will prevent any accidents while using a slicer."
4,"Comfy but a bit smelly, takes a while for smell to go away.","Fits full size bed great, and is comfortable but the smell of the foam is a bit too strong at first. I've had it for a month now and the smell isn't as strong but I can still smell it."
3,"""Comfortable but""","I purchased this topper in the 1st part of January. It is comfortable to sleep on and the ""chemical"" odor disappeared within 24 hours of airing. The downside to the mattress is, it does not hold up to active sleeping. The topper is splitting in two areas. I would have expected it to hold together longer than two months."
2,comfy but not durable,"I bought the 4"" version of the 4-lb mattress topper about 2 years ago. After about a year or 1.5 years of use, it started seriously deteriorating.Finally today (after months of putting up with lying in ""crevasses"" of broken mattress pad) we threw it out. It was falling apart into chunks that looked just like crumbly sponge-cake; the only way it even held together enough for us to even carry it out was by carrying it rolled up in a sheet.I was hoping it would last longer than this. Although it was comfortable while it lasted, I would not buy a Serta brand memory foam mattress topper again."
5,Loving it!,I love this item and can't get out of bed now. Make sure you air it out and order a size up as it does not fit if you order the real size!!
3,Cheap,"So I bought the 2"" one for my girlfriend's bed (it was terribly uncomfortable). She's been sleeping on it for a couple months now and it's lost all of its ""memory"". Glad I got it cheap. Another thing; I'm not even sure if it's really Serta. It had another company's name on some of the papers that came with it."
2,Served their purpose,1. These were difficult to keep open. Some would not stay open at all and were discarded.2. A completely obtrusive 'Made in China' is printed on each umbrella. It probably takes up a quarter of the umbrella. I would have bought different ones had I'd known this.
1,"cheap, lowest quality","I realize this is a very inexpensive item so I didn't expect much, and I was still disappointed. I could barely open the umbrellas without them ripping, most of them gave me splinters and wouldn't stay open. I also purchased from oriental trading at the same time and theirs were much better quality."
4,A good traditional anthology,"This is a good book to use in tandem with Muldoon's Faber Book of Contemporary Irish Poetry and Crotty's Modern Irish Poetry for the understanding of contemporary Irish poetry. It allocates its main space to Kinsella, Heaney, Montague, Mahon, Muldoon and Durcan, in that order. Some of the poets may hold the substantial space allotted to them because they were important two and three decades ago, but this anthology nonetheless sparkles in the selections it makes from these poets, and in the inclusion of Deane, Grennan, Mathews and Sirr. The editor Mahon has made an outstanding selection from his own work, and the book is a good introduction to the important, mischievous work of Michael Hartnett. As an anthology it has a unified and valid character all its own in the presentation of contemporary Irish poetry."
1,Incomplete and not able to obtain a new one,the order was incomplete and the vendor was unable to send out a new one even though their site stated they had the product in stock.
4,Best Film Of 2011,"Even if it was sourced from a TV show from 2010, this movie came out in 2011 and was, to my mind, the best film of the year. While it may not have the grand scope of Malick's lava shots, it is a big movie in it's own small and simple way. I read nothing about how the movie was made before seeing it and couldn't tell what was improv and what was written. The only other time I can recall that happening was while watching Altman's California Split. In fact, the movie has a lot in common with that somewhat forgotten Altman masterpiece. They are both modest films about seemingly nothing, rambling along, just two guys having fun and getting on each other's nerves. And both films end up being very deep and poignant and about the shortcomings of a life looking for gain."
1,BOORRING & Repetitive,dont' waste your time.This movie is 2 hours of eating while doing celebrity impersonations.Seriously I don't even know why this movie was ever made.
3,A bit of a romp.,"The film kept my interest, but it was nothing to write home about. The film meanders too much. Apparently, Steve Coogan fancies himself a real Lothario. Nothing in this film to stick to your ribs. More of an amuse-bouche. Better than a sharp stick in the eye."
2,"Tries hard to be Sideways, Fails Miserably",I loved Steve Coogan in Hamlet II ad was hoping to see more of his range. Instead I was bored for two hours with the vain hope that it was just a build up to a good punchline or something... anything. It never happened. The most you'll get out of this is watching actors ad lib some ok impressions of other actors and some navel gazing. Don't waste the time. Watch Sideways again instead.
1,Not Impressed,I couldn't get into this movie. I found it boring. I watched only about half of it. It's homor was too dry.
1,UGH,"What a waste of my time. I streamed it for 30 minutes and finally had to delete it. Watch at your own risk. (But hey, if you have insomnia it might actually help!)"
4,Funny for the right audience.,"I caught this on Netflix the other day.Fans of Steve Coogan of (Saxondale, Alan Partridge) and Rob Brydon(Gavin and Stacey, Would I Lie To You) will undoubtedly enjoy this film. Fans of witty banter will probably enjoy it as well. Others should probably look elsewhere.There is no slapstick or ""much"" situational humor in this as it's really about the conversations between these 2 fine comedic actors.I was not familiar with Rob Brydon's ""small man in a box"" or his incredible talent for mimicry until seeing this.Both do a really good Michael Caine at various points in his career. Simply amazing."
3,It was okay. Better than expected.,"I wasn't sure about this film at first, but it grows on you. My husband thought it was really funny."
3,TV travelogue cobbled into feature length,"Not too bad. A couple of fairly interesting comedians/actors travel around eating gourmet meals and doing impressions of other British comedians/actors. But only the most over-the-top Anglophiles would say this is five star material. It's basically a television travelogue cut down and cobbled together into a feature length film. If you want to see Steve Coogan at his best, get ""Hamlet 2"". Don't know about the other guy Rob Brydon. It was the first time I had ever seen him. This film did not make me want to see more. Steve Coogan comes off as a self-involved and pretty dull guy in this outing. Glad I had the pleasure of ""Hamlet 2"" first. If you're a Michael Caine fan, the duelling Caine impressions might provide some interest. But it's available on Youtube in a 3-4 minute segments, so there's no reason for anyone to sit through 2 hours of Coogan and his pal dining and whining."
2,Fan of Brit Humor but this was way too Self-absorbed,"I like Brit humor. I like intellectual discussion and humor that requires a certain amount of education. This movie could have been funny, but it wasn't. The near total self-absorbtion of the characters with their rather trivial lives, coupled with the random impersonations they did, left me cold. Someone whose opinion I value told me to watch it and they loved it, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. It could be the kind of film that depends heavily on who you watch it with. I struggled through it."
3,Doesn't really deliver,"At first I thought ""This is going to be fun"" as I watched the two actors bantor and do impressions of Sean Connery and Richard Caine. But that's as good as it gets in that category. It gets redundant and old before too long. There are some beautiful scenes of England and Scotland(Wales?) included. Very nice with decent music choices. No real sex, violence, or political tilt. Seems that there was some profanity, but it didn't stick with me as overdone. It's designed somewhat like a modern ""real-life"" program which on the whole is a tiresome format. Maybe it was more like a documentary, however with a script,etc. about travelling and eating atla-de-da gourmet restaurants. Overall, I enjoyed this program, but it fell kind of flat. I watched it twice, however."
4,There's only one big thing that sucks about this DVD,"Having seen the miniseries this movie was cut from I was hoping to get a few scenes as special features maybe. I had my fingers crossed that there might be an impressions reel with at least truncated footage from the show, not alas, no. The movie is still sublime as ever, and there are quite a few deleted scenes or early takes on the special features, but it strategically resists some of the funniest bits from the miniseries. ""The Trip"" is a funny, sweet, clever, and charming movie where Coogan and Bryden seem to be having a ball playing themselves. I actually prefer the movie cut to the miniseries (mainly because Bryden doesn't try to cheat on his wife in the movie. I liked him so much before that moment), but some of the impressions that were removed to get the time down are missed greatly. Oh well."
3,Dining for Free,Two best friends enjoy good food for free and time off round the UK while sorting out their relations and affairs with loved ones left behind for a week.Don't confuse it withThe Tripalso some tunes sounded.I am not impressed.
3,A Show About Nothing,"My thoughts:The countryside in northern England was gorgeous.The impersonations were very good but neverending and became tedious.Steve Coogan doesnt have to work very hard to 'get some'.I really dont know why they decided to release this film but it was okay.You get to hear Steve yell ""aha"" into a canyon.Bring back Alan Partridge!"
2,Not Really Sure Why...,It was like reading a news paper... a lot of words but not much in the way of excitement. I am still not even sure what point this movie was trying to convey. It was like watching a Harold & Kumar road trip but with 2 PBS telethon hosts cast as the main characters.
4,Funny guys on a restaurant road trip,"Steve Coogan's deadpan humor is a sharp contrast to Rob Brydon's constant impressions. Enjoy the banter and the competition, as well as feelings of inadequacy, that surface as they take a trip around the northern part of England in order to sample the fare at various inns."
4,Great works!,"This is an inexpensive, yet wonderful collection of African folk tales. They are brilliant- a must-have!"
3,Good price!,"I do not recommend paying more than $3 for this book because it is small, short, and not well bound. However, the stories are decently interesting and my son loved it."
2,Lots of negative messages,"Like the old European fairy tales, this book has a lot of stories in which the characters, many of them animals, get eaten or somehow die. The book is very inexpensive, which is nice but I don't recommend this for small children."
1,trash writing,"The authors cannot be serious, can they? It reads like a ""little book"" for little, or limited minds.A waste of trees and a kind of insult to those who don't use horse culture as sexual intrigue.So Meh! How about doing honest relationship for a change?"
3,One Chap's Opinion,"Have I read the book?Neigh!!!!!!!!!But, the title is so titillating, so provocative, that I am compelled to order the book and partake of what are likely a bevy of unadulterated delights.I must admit to my rapt curiosity of what makes a horse become a lesbian rather than lusting after the stallions in the herd.I am hoping the book will answer my question."
5,Very good product!,I like it a lot! The water comes out strongly enough and you can adjust it the way you like it
5,Excellent! Good for developing relationships with God & oth,This is an excellent book about the price people pay for being damaged in their early years. Most people hide when they have been rejected or fear rejection. Sandra rightly says that the only way out is to experience God's unconditional love.She also gives very practical advice about how to know God personally and intimately. This is not just another bland how to book; it speaks to the heart!
4,"On Life, Death and Love","Again, the Vatican: The ageing pontiff faces death unless the famous, Jewish doctor performs surgery immediately. The risk? Nothing much - it's like getting into a car or a plane. You accept the risk, then forget it. Turning down surgery carries swift - and certain - death, so the heir of the fisherman accepts.Being under the knife brings the iron-fisted hard-liner to a personal crisis, and he emerges another man after having seen death in the eye - thus the title. But the statistical risk of not making it through surgery is infinitesimal - compared to becoming the target of professional assassins as they gather around their prey.As often is with West, he combines quick action with personal trauma. And once again, he does it well. The thrill and the thoughts are both essential, and the book is worth reading. And, not surprisingly, a twist at the end."
2,SALTY,This is the salties protein powder I've ever tasted. I have tried many.If you look in the ingredient section you'll see how much salt there is in it. I didn't know until AFTER I made my protein shake. Wow! Super salt.
3,Egg protein. Bah!,"My experience with this product:1. Too much sodium in a scoop for only an ""acceptable"" amount of protein in it. More than one scoop and holy water retention. A cup of chicken breast would give you the same grams of protein with less sodium at a cheaper price.2. Don't really understand the appeal of egg protein powder outside of the whole BV thing.3. Not cost-effective overall. Buy real eggs or real meat instead. This really extends to every protein powder period. They're a waste of money unless you exercise HEAVY like an athlete or bodybuilder.4. The calories per serving isn't too bad at all. Fitting it into your target should not be a real issue."
2,"Vanilla Custard, NOT so delicious.","We really wanted to like this. The taste is just really horrible. (I know that taste is objective, so I didn't give it the lowest score.) That said, we have five daily protein shake drinkers in our household and none of us like it. We've tried mixing it with milk, water, almond milk, juice, fruit -- I hate the thought of wasting it, but no one can stomach it. It has a slightly metallic taste. I'm not sure if I'm willing to try the other flavors or if we'll just search for another brand, but we definitely won't purchase Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein in Vanilla Custard again."
4,"Inexpensive, healthy, and decent tasting","This protein powder was purchased as a response to realizing that my wife is lactose intolerant. She's tried the whey protein and found that it upsets her digestive system, causes nausea, cramping, bloating, and all the other side effects of lactose intolerance. I recommended that we try egg white protein, and have had excellent results. The powder by itself is pretty low-calorie, low fat, low carb, high in protein, and has a decent flavor. It mixes well with water, but tastes a lot better when mixed with unflavored, chocolate, or vanilla almond milk or with chocolate coconut milk. The chocolate coconut milk and egg white protein has become my wife's favorite breakfast shake, and she raves about how good it tastes. Cheaper than most other premium powders, but not as delicious as the shakes made by BSN. Still recommended, since it's a great alternative for people that can't handle whey or milk."
1,Contains aspartame: Eat at your own risk.,Don't buy this. It's unbelievable that any company today would sell a product containing aspartame to humans. It is sweet poison. Eat at your own risk.
2,I really wanted to like this...,"When I bought these, I really wanted to like them. I bought the chocolate and then vanilla custard. Both of them are nasty. They have an egg like taste and aftertaste. Both of them upset my stomach so I have to say pass on these."
5,Delish and better price than Robb Whatever-his-face-is.,Delish and better price than Robb Whatever-his-face-is. DEfinitely way better on your stomach than the whey. Tastes best if mixed with a little coconut or almond milk
5,Great Product.,Doesn't have that protein aftertaste or texture. Great before or after a workout.I purchase this product every month and will continue.
3,Acceptable,"I like to pump iron, and I've used a lot of different protein powders in my day. This powder I would rate as acceptable. Here's why:The pros:1. The primary ingredient is egg albumen. Therefore, it is high quality protein.2. It contains more essential amino acids than an equivalent serving of whey protein.3. It does not bother my lactose intolerant stomach.The cons:1. The taste is not the worst I've ever had, but it is certainly not the best either. As protein powders go, I would rate the taste as manageable.2. This powder does not dissolve easily. I always use a hand blender. If you don't have a blender handy, plan to do a lot of shaking.I rate it as acceptable."
4,Happy with this,"I've been using this for a while now and am pretty happy with it. It doesn't taste chalky and gross like some that I have tried and the price is not too bad, especially with the subscribe and save option. I wouldn't drink this just for the heck of it though, but for what it is intended it is good. Just make sure you mix it really well and don't have it sitting for long unless you shake it up again. I used a blender bottle and love it. It isn't something that you can just mix up with a spoon because it is lumpy and definitely won't taste good. I've also tried the Vanilla Custard flavor and that is not too bad either. Definitely recommend this brand."
4,Good and healthier,The taste is pretty good - I've tried the chocolate one and I didn't have much problem with the aftertaste. It didn't mix too well though - if using a stirrer. Mixes well in a blender.As per my trainer - it is good to alternate between whey and this protein.
3,Decent protein but too salty,"The nutritional profile of this egg protein is pretty good. Low carbs, fat, cholesterol, and high in protein. The only problem is the sodium in this thing. 550mg per serving? Insane. You can DEFINITELY taste it as well if you mix it with water, not so much with milk. If they lower the sodium to 3/4 that amount then I'll think about giving them another star.The taste of the protein is okay. If you use this for breakfast, be prepared to have the taste of eggs in your mouth while burping.Bottomline: TOO SALTY.UPDATE: It seems my stomach doesn't really agree with this protein. It gives me the runs every time, even with just one scoop. There is a delayed reaction of about 6 hours. I guess I'm sticking with whey from now on."
5,Morning ritual,My husband makes fresh fruit smoothies every morning. Egg protein is more difficult to find and this is the only brand he will use.
4,Good stuff...,"Okay, so it's not the best tasting stuff in the world. I mean, it's egg...flavored to taste like vanilla custard. What do you expect? But it's definitely a good source of protein and helps me recover quicker after a tough workout. I'd try the chocolate instead if I were you, though."
4,great for mixers,This protein is pretty decent tasting with milk or any kind.. not so great with water. But it does mix well and I typically put it in smoothies so it definitely gets the job done and a versatile flavor. just not so fond of it by itself.. maybe in chocolate though it would be better
3,as expected but taste is lacking,"this protein arrived as expected and was as advertised. i'm not crazy about the egg taste, which perhaps should have been expected by the ""custard"" part of the flavor name. i was able to add a small amount of straight cocoa powder to each serving to mask the egg-ie taste and make it through the 2 pounds. i wanted to try the egg protein as an option to get away from the dairy in the whey protein, i'll be looking for other options, but only from a taste standpoint. the powder itself was as expected."
2,Tasted Horrible,Tried mixing it with Nesquick chocolate milk mix to amp the chocolate flavor but the pungent egg raste keeps coming through.
4,Great protein for those who cannot drink whey!,"This is a great product. I am a gym rat, 5 days/week for 2.5 hours a day. I lift heavy and run 15 miles per week. My only problem has always been that I cannot drink whey protein because it causes me sever stomach cramps, nausea and other gross things. In order to meet my protein needs I decided to give ON's Egg protein a try. I have used many of their products and have always appreciated their quality standards. Hands down, this is a great egg protein as I imagined ON would put out on the market. It mixes really well in a simple shaker cup and water. Tastes great (bought the royal chocolate flavor) and certainly helps with my recovery from training. Egg, by the way, is the most bio-available protein out there and will not make you as acidic as milk derivative protein (whey/casein). I will definitely be purchasing this again. The only reason why I didn't give this product 5 stars is because of the price. It could be a bit cheaper."
4,Poster Board,"Exactly what you would expect from poster board. Nothing special, but nothing to complain about either. Great for art projects or even cheap paint canvas, this board is normal thickness and brightness. Much better price than from your local office supply store and eligible for PRIME shipping, so it's a win."
2,Not like Poster Board,"I assumed all poster board is poster board. I was very wrong. This product is very thin! It is a great price per board otherwise. At Wal-Mart you will pay 97 cents each, however, at Wal-Mart it is more like the poster board you would want. Sturdy, thick, small hands can handle it without crushing it to pieces. Not sure what to do now. Guess I will see what it cost to return it. What a bummer!!! Need it now for homeschool!"
3,Riverside posterboard,"I've been buying this product for a while. Normally it's pretty good although nearly every package has come with some of the corners dented in. Fortunately, I can still use it in that condition. The last order however, came with a significant variation in the weight of the posterboard. Out of four packages one was as it usually is, but three of them were of a very much lighter weight. I really need a consistent product."
1,Packaging was not strong enough to hold shipment and arrived empty,Packaging was not strong enough to hold shipment and arrived empty. Probably good quality but I have no way of knowing
4,It has stickers on the back of each sheet,and they are very difficult to remove. Some sheets have more than one. Paper is of good quality otherwise.
1,You can do better,"Having an relative involved in aviation, I thought this book might be interesting. However, even with my limited personal aviation experience, I found much of what the author writes unbelievable. The stories were simplistic and seemed to be based on the public's perception of flying instead of reality."
5,Inspirational book,"I loved this book, and I highly recommend it to others, especially young people. The main theme of the book is do not take no for an answer; you can accomplish your goals if you persevere. Ms. Getline tells an entertaining story of how she accomplished her goal, which was becoming an airline pilot. This book is for people who are not interested in the airline industry as well as those that are, and for men as well as women. Read this book!"
1,There are better aviation themed books out there........,"I received this book as an early birthday gift from a relative who thought I might enjoy an aviation book as the topic is one of my favorites. Unfortunately, I could not make it 1/2 way through this book. The anecdotes were neither humorous nor believable, in my opinion, and I wonder how much ""artistic license"" was taken by the author. If one wants to read interesting, true to life narratives, I would suggest Gann or Buck."
5,"Up, Up and Away!","This book was a page-turner for me! Meryl has energy, passion and purpose--a dynamite combination. She tells her story in a breezy, humorous way, which makes for fun and interesting reading. It just proves what one can accomplish when one is totally focused on the goal...she knew from a young age that she MUST become a commercial pilot...at the time, probably sounded like Noah wanting to build an ark in the middle of the long draught. She has inspired me!"
5,I read in it one day - couldn't put it down!!,A fun and fast-moving collection of stories from one who has many unusual life experiences. A great family book - clean and appropriate for all ages. The author's story is inspiring but never preachy.
1,Inaccurate fiction,I was definitely disappointed with Ms. Getline's writing. The stories were generic if true at all and her writing style was very bland.
1,Poor book,"I did not enjoy this book. I found it unbelievable, poorly written, and pretty much a waste of my time. I recommend you save your money, there are much better books out there on aviation than this one."
4,A great light hearted book,"It is one of those books that make you laugh and smile while reading it, with envious subway commuters staring at you.A light hearted read that captures the spirit of air travel. She is truly adventurous!Highly recommended!!"
1,from another airline captain,"I'm also an airline Captain. I will say, this book title is a bit misleading. The book is all about the author and reads like a teenager's diary. It has virtually nothing to do with flying or aviation - not in any genuine way. Read this book for a good inspirational 'You can do anything' feeling, when you are young. If you want a book with inside info on flying and the cockpit experience, this is not the book.Keep in mind, this book was self published - so don't expect it to be written at the level of a professional author."
1,Dont bother........,"Another attempt at writing by using a subject that sells politically correct bs.Received as a gift, gave it back,,,,,,,what a boring book."
4,Could Be Better,"Now, that we have blu ray, these classic album series could be even better if the actual album is presented in all its glory, stereo and/or surround. There is enough room to house the discussion and the full album. All we have now is the discussion and bits and pieces of various tracks. Why not play the whole album in another chapter (audio only)."
1,"OMG, Really?! This is trash!","This is the best example of how a big household name like Trump can be used to market and over price products that are truly shameful and rubbish. I could not believe the contents of this Cds. I thought higher of Mr. Trump's products before listening to these videos. I was fortunate enough to resell it rapidly on Amazon's marketplace and did not loose much money. The name, the marketing and the packaging will lead you to believe you are buying a great product, but honestly this is not. I beleive this is my only one star review for an Amazon product in years, but this one, truly deserves it. Two stars on it would be overselling its virtues! Very incompetent and over priced!"
1,Way over priced,This series is a good way to lose money. Unless you were born with millions of dollars you will never be able to implement any of these concepts. I recommend you save you hard earned money.
4,A defect in the cover but not a bad deal.,"The first two reviews are correct: the version of the first film is the out of print fullscreen edition without the extras. However, the rest are the same as the released versions, along with Police Academy 4 still being (bafflingly so) a fullscreen version."
4,A guilty pleasure BUT WIDE SCREEN/FULL SCREEN PROBLEM,"Ok, these films are a guilty pleasure.They made TOO MANY OF THEM.This DVD package has the 1st four of the films.I remember when the 1st film came out.All of the films are funny, of course the 1st film the 1 that started it all is the best.You see how many of the characters come & go in the film series.It is good in this 2 disc collection that all four of the films have an extra ""Making of"" special.But, here is what I DO NOT understand.The 1st 3 films are wide screen but 4 Citizens on Patrol IS FULL SCREEN. Can anyone explain this?4th film notable for return of G. W. Bailey as Harris. And both David Space & Sharon Stone in early film roles.2cd film has ""WKRP's"" Howard Hesseman. His only appearance in the seriesAnd, of course, the big huge problem I keep complaining about in reviews. It come in these HORRIBLE, CHEAP PLASTIC CASES WITH THE INTENTIONAL HOLES IN THEM. These things are horrible & DVD's can be damaged."
1,waste of money,"Do not waste your money on this. The description is false. The original movie and #4 are both 4x3 ratio, not 16x9 widescreen as described here. The really sad part is the packaging. In the printed specs on the package, every movie but #4 is listed as ""Widescreen [16x9 1.85:1]"" which is a blatantly false."
1,1st movie is barebones,"beware , the 1st movie in this collection is barebones not the special edition described on the back of the box"
3,missing CDs,I ordered the Policy Academy 1-4 DVD set and received a DVD package with two discs including Police Academy 1 and 3. Police Academy 2 and 4 are missing. I triple checked both DVDs just to make sure that each disk had two movies however there is only one movie per each disk.How can this be resolved?
3,funny,the movies were funny and a bit nestologic which is nice and wonderful remeber from my youth whic is nice
2,Football Doorslammer,Item is difficult to get attached to door. Pieces were assemble backwards and we had to take it apart and reassemble the hooks. Not worth the money.
3,"Ok toy, well made.","This is a well made toy and holds up to abuse.. The mat is very thick. It does keep falling off the hooks that hang over the door though. My boys like it but loose interest very quickly. You just keep throwing the ball to the same spot over and over so not much excitement. The sound is good and so is voice, wish it had volume control though!"
3,The price was right.,"Actually it was my daughter that wanted the Megafood - Balanced B Complex, 90 tablets. It was a bit expensive until we looked at what Amazon.com was offering. She is happy with her purchase through Amazon."
3,Nice detail but...,"There are tons of pics and info about the European models, but unfortunately not alot of pics and details about USA models. Good info however on the colors and some technical areas."
4,GOOD,"THESE THREE EPISODES ARE NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS, BUT STILL WORTH WATCHING. THE THRID, WITH JON LOVITZ IS THE BEST (I THINK) END"
2,Sugary sweetness completely overpowers the tropical fruit flavor,"These gummies are far less chewy than any other gummy I've ever had and they were outright sugary. I don't know if I happened on a bad batch, or if Haribo's Tropi-Frutti gummies are meant to be so sugary and less chewy, and I'm not talking sugary as a person who prefers less sugar, I'm talking sugary as in the amount of sugar completely over powers the fruit flavor. I won't be buying these again, especially since Haribo makes so many other wonderful gummies."
5,Really great stuff to get you moving with visual thinking!,"I have always enjoyed reading - and playing around with the ideas from - Kurt Hank's books. I have all his books, which include Rapid Viz, Design Yourself, The Change Navigator, Wake Up Your Creative Genius, Up Your Productivity.Like his other books, this book is very well-illustrated, conceptually & graphically, with the following key chapters:- Introduction: Anyone Can Draw;- Methods, Tools & Techniques;- Rapid Visualisation;- Ideation;- Notation;- Communication;It's primary focus is to help you, the reader, in re-establishing drawing in your life...as a tool to solve problems, create new ideas & assist communication.Packed with ideas, games, puzzles & exercises, it provides a step by step approach to the practical strategies of visualising, expressing & communicating your ideas - and concepts - on paper.I must say: It is really great stuff."
2,Not what I thought it was,"I was expecting a book weighted toward doodling; idea-generation; capturing thoughts on paper. I was disappointed to find it more oriented toward graphic artists or illustrators. Lots of topics like composition, perspective, etc. And the sample sketches and examples are way way more professional than I could ever hope to be. Bottom-line, I found it more oriented toward illustrators or artists than toward thinkers who want to doodle."
2,Don't bother!,"I would never buy these again!Hard ride compared to my old stock Toyota shocks and then there's this vinyl cover which come with it with no instructuctions or a way to fasten it so I had to improvise and use tye wraps and still have a noise when I'm over sixty MPH,A loud rattling noise that even mechanics can't figure out. I even uninstalled my trailer hitch thinking that was the problem.I've learned NEVER to use anything other than stock TOYOTA parts!"
4,Toys for grandkids,"Bought for grandkids Xmas, was happy with overall and the kids had fun and played creatively mixing with other magnet packages that I bought for them [bugs and faces].. Nice carrying case too."
4,So fun!,I have these up on my file cabinets at work just for something fun to look at and people stop all the time and make comments about how fun they are!
1,IT is not worth,really very dissapointing this videos becayse Igot the first edition and was surprised just one topic how to scan a foto. It is not even 5$ worth
4,A human mother of many wild chimpanzee children,"Stella began collecting orphaned animals practically before she could walk around the grounds of her African home. By age seven she was mothering an infant monkey. Soon she was in charge of a menagerie including an ever growing population of orphaned chimpanzees. The centerpiece of the book is how Stella managed to find a way to support and rear and release into the wild a never ending stream of animals sent from all over the world. She was helped by native Africans, publishers, and even the keepers of Gombe, Jane Goodall and Hugo van Lawik. This is not a story of superwoman, but rather of an ordinary woman with extraordinary determination and love. Read it if you can."
2,A waste of money.,"The author points out in the book's ""forward"" that it is Not a travel guide. Pity. If you go to AAA their travel guides offer descriptions of restaurants in much more depth. Seems he should have concentrated on either Southern ""history"" or Southern ""food"". He flip-flops to much and does not include even a single recipe in this book. Very disappointing."
4,You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet!,"If you live anywhere near the city if Illadelph, you've no doubt heard how impressive Josephine Sincere's CD ""Feels So Good"" is. And impressive it is: her voice is solid -- she can REALLY sing, the music is infectious and refreshing, and the songs are real R&B. The real treats on this CD are ""Kiling Me Softly,"" ""Mamma,"" ""If U Take Your Luv,"" and ""Jane."" WOW... ""Jane""!! What a powerful song! I loved the song by itself, but when I saw the video, I actually shed a tear. You owe it to yourself to experience this young lady's (17-years old) work.But guess what -- you Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet! Being a member of Philly's media, I got to hear some of the live material from her next CD and it is scarry good! (she's performing with a hot Jazz band). So, I highly recommend ""Feels So Good"" as a means of introducing yourself to a truly gifted young talent. You'll also appreciate the fact that she's bringing it on a whole different vibe."
1,Does not spray evenly!,"This is the worst spray I've ever used. It comes out looking flocked, and the nozzle clogs up almost instantly. It is pretty frustrating, since I planned to use it as a primer under a top coat of white paint, and now it must all be resanded and reprimed. I've used the gallon type before, and was really impressed, but I should have listened to what others have said about this product."
4,Safety Tow Bar,"I bought this tow bar to tow my MGB that I'm rebuilding around to get it worked on. I've used it once and it worked fine. The safety chains are a little short, but usuable. This was the cheapest one I could fine so it does not have features of the more expensive versions. Basically, you have to get the tow vehicle and the towed vehicle lined up very close in order to connect. This is a hassle but acceptable to me for the price. Would not recommend it if you use it often."
2,PRODUCT DID NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS,"My fiance and I purchased this item thinking it would make a great addition to our room. The pictures looked great. As it turns out, the product is not as nice. The chairs are too shallow (not deep enough) to be comfortable and leave a large unsightly gap between the seat and bottom swivel portion. Also, the color does not appear to be Espresso, but rather black/brown. I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN."
3,"Great for single player, but the multiplayer in the PS2 version is broken","Buyer beware: there is no co-op quickplay in the PS2 version of this game. The single-player is fine (although it lacks the DLC of the current-gen versions), but if you want to play co-op, you need to start a co-op career mode band and unlock ALL the songs ALL OVER AGAIN. Cheat codes are no help either. I understand this issue has been fixed with a downloadable patch on the 360 version, but us PS2 owners have been kind of left out to dry.The track list is incredible, though, so if you'll primarily be playing single-player, it's still a good buy."
2,How to wreck a franchise,"Lousy play interface, over-sensitive game play, truly awful sound, and boring graphics. Save your money and hope Activision brings back Harmonix to develop the next edition of this formerly-great game."
1,I Haven't received my order,"I don't know what happened I was requesting my order through an APO. I waited for three long weeks, and suddenly I just received an email saying that my guitar Hero Aerosmith was returned by me, but I didn't returned it. The think is my Guitar Hero III is not here and they are not sending even a message about it I'm angry I wanted to play this really cool videogame."
5,awesome,"i enjoy it immensely! even if you aren't able to beat songs on hard or even medium, you can really have a lot of fun playing this game"
3,Same Old Thing,Same old thing as the first two with new songs. Easier hammer-ons make it so you almost don't have to strum at all.
4,You can't use Rockband wireless guitar!,"I like the variety of choices of songs in this Guitar Hero III. It's better than just rock type music along like its previous two installments. For example, I like the songs ""Hit Me with the Best Shot"" and ""Barracuda"" when I was playing demo in the store. That's was the main reason that I got this game and not getting the other two. Too bad though, I can't use Rockband wireless guitar from the bundle to play this game. Anyone got solution for it? In any case, I love the game."
5,The best GH out there,"Lots of songs, nice and harder gameplay,great price, AMAZON's.com fast shipping!!!Go for it !"
3,Low replay value,"I have all of the GH games (except Aerosmith) and Rock Band 2. GH3 has the lowest ratio of replayable songs of all of them. Out of what, 73 songs I will replay about 5 of them. And on the PS2, the save times are a deal breaker. It takes SO LONG between songs. That said, this game rates the third star solely on the strength of Cliffs of Dover and Cult of Personality, two of the funnest songs on any of the games."
4,Guitar Hero III Review,"Guitar Hero 3 is a very good game. It has alot better songs then Guitar Hero 2, but overall the game is not as difficult as Guitar Hero 2, although it does has have really tricky rhythms. Overall I recommend the game."
3,I was so dissapointed after a long wait,"I am a 64 yr. young grandmother and I fell in love with GH 2 and went out and bought the whole system. I have been around since rock and roll began and I was truly dissapointed with the selection of songs. Did we really have to go to European countries to get music for the Bonus songs?? We ARE the history of guitar and have many, many good guitar songs they could use that at least you can understand the words and there isn't any screaming. Try listening to: A Long Cool Woman in a BLack Dress for starters and Rebel Rouser. I may sound old to you, but I was in the beginning of the Rock generation and I raised my children with music in the house all the time. I wrote RedOctane and they replied, but I think they just blew me off. Thanks for listening."
3,Could have been better.,"It wasn't a terrible game, just not quite as good as GH1 or 2. I beat it in about a day. The difficulty has gone up a bit, some songs I had to replay because I failed them even though I can get five stars on almost any song on GH2 on the same difficulty level. After every other song set you have to battle a boss. That parts actually pretty fun but you can't go back and replay them after you've beaten the game. The songs were okay... some were great, some really shouldn't have been on the game. In my opinion, the not so good songs outweigh the great songs making GH3 just an okay with a limited desire of re-playability. I played GH2 for quite a long time after I had beaten it, but with GH3 I just feel that's going to be the case."
3,Disappointing. PS2 must have been ported as an afterthought.,"I'm a big fan of the Guitar Hero series, but Guitar Hero III is a disappointment. It is clear that porting this to the PS2 was an afterthought. The sound and graphics are poorer than those of GHII. It can take up to two minutes just to load a song and the game frequently freezes up, requiring a restart. The only reason to buy this is to get the new songs. Everything else is a step down."
4,Can't stop playing it!!!,"My kids couldn't wait to receive the game. Ever since it arrived, they haven't stopped playing it. I may need to buy one more in case this one gets too hot!!! So much fun."
3,I LOVE IT BUT!!!,I LOVE IT BECAUSE I KNOW ALL THE SONG AND JUST LOVE IT I RATED IT 3 BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONNECT WITH THE BAND HERO GUITAR BUT I THINK MINES BROKEN OR SOMETHING CAUSE I KNOW IT CAN CONNECT WITH OTHER GUITAR HERO AND ROCK BAND GAMES
1,guitar hero 3,"It's not that I wouldn't love the game, but because I was not aware or informed that it was in NTSC form and I am from Australia, where it should be in PAL form- I am unable to play it. All the electrical stores I have been to say they have never seen nor heard of a NTSC-PAL converter, which was suggested by the company."
4,start on medium,"it's a fun game game quite easy on easy mode, the songs don't change after that, so I recomend starting on medium mode to give you a challenge."
4,Very addicting,This game was a christmas gift to my boyfriend.He has enjoyed playing this game for many hours. If one wants to be ignored for a long period of time this is the game to get ones companion. I have played it a few times myself and did find it very addiciting but also fun. Woman with children should give this a try when they want to be left alone for a while.
2,Not Appropriate,"This game, involves the devil.Lot's of people love this, but it is not for kids under 13(that's what I think.)A big fat 0 is what the age is for.If you want to kill your kids Imagination, go right ahead, or make our father sad. Please get this game away from kids under 13. My daughter, Tia played it at a friends house. Then we saw the video. DON""T HURT YOUR BRAIN OR YOUR LIFE!"
3,Another GH,"Well, after playing GH 1&2, I wasn't expecting anything really groundbreaking. I was, however, expecting the best song list of the line, as many gaming sites stated.As always, Guitar Hero stands or falls on the strength of the songs, and while there are some good songs, overall I wasn't impressed.So three quick notes if your considering buying it:1- Have a look at the song list first, as you will enjoy it much more with songs you know and/or like.2- Battle Mode is silly and superfluous.3- The saving times are much longer than previous games for some reason, and waiting 30 second after each song is very annoying"
5,Amazing package,"I read the reviews about the installation issues and turned off my virus protection just in case, had no issues what-so-ever with the installation or the internet activation.I'm running the package on a 3 year old laptop with Windows XP. Was worried that 512 Meg RAM would be too little but things are running smooth (but of course I cannot run many things simultaneously).I'm very impressed with the products offered in this package, it covers all my design needs and more. I'm new to many of the included products but don't find them as intimidating as some people claim. The package has many advanced features but that does not mean that it is complicated or difficult to use, the most common tools are easy to find.If you need a professional design studio package, don't even think about buying anything else than this."
1,This was a Nightmare Purchase,"No where in my order for Adobe Creative Suite 3 (Old Version) was Student Licensing mentioned. If I had wanted Student Licensing I would have purchase Adobe Creative Suite 4 (New Version) directly from Adobe for $499. This is a business and a business can not legally use a Student License. This re-seller first blamed Amazon for deceptive advertising, Amazon had to force the re-seller to give me an address to return product to and once I did return re-seller is not acknowledging that the product has been returned. I believe American Express is going to help with my refund. Also AMEX indicated there has been a lot of problems with Amazon."
4,"Fits perfect, no problems.","Several people have told me to use OEM Honda products for my B18B1 engine. I decided to save some money and try Beck Arnley. I'm not disappointed at all. Fits fine, no problems installing. Use a little silicone at the corners and you're done. Rings / valve seals fit just fine, same with grommets.By the way, I'd like to rep Eric the Car Guy. You can find him on Youtube or his website. Informative, more or less direct videos. Great stuff.1996 Acura Integra SE"
1,Colors,"When I Ordered the Kindle in purple, I thought the stylus pens would be purple also, not orange. They look terrible together, although the two orders were placed at the same time"
5,Kindle Fire Stylus,"Just the right size,.Works great !! Fingers do not smear the screen.Fits really good in the kindle fire cover slot."
3,A cheap most have stilus,"Is a cheap most have stilus if you bought a Kindle Fire. I bought this item because I got the ""CaseCrown Bold Standby Case (Orange) for Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet""."
1,Cheap,"This didn't last a month. It was very cheaply made and fell apart. Also, it smudged the screen almost as much as my finger does."
5,Kindle Fire Stylus,"How did I ever function without this little gadget?!! It's convenient, easy to use, and no finger smudges on my screens now. The little plastic adapter that inserts into the headphone jack is a great invention. My stylus hangs right from my iPhone and is there when I need it. Love this thing!"
3,It's works....,"I thought a stylus would come in handy because it's a bit clumsy to peck things out with my fingers. I wasn't sure where this stylus was supposed to be stored. I thought it could stay in the headphone jack at all times. The string is too short for that. I store it in there and just take it out when I'm using it. I don't know if I like it just hanging there but that's where it is. If my cover was different I could probably store it inside but there isn't room. Maybe I don't need a stylus but for now it works. The quality is fine, the color is great, I'm just not sure if it's necessary."
3,"Cute, but...","It had me at ORANGE...and it is a fine little stylus at it's business end, BUT the OTHER end fell apart after a few weeks of use. Inserting it into the audio outlet to secure it to my Kindle Fire is apparently NOT what that bit of plactic is engineered for, but on my OTHER Minisuit stylus this is not a problem, as it is molded differently. Since that end piece cannot be utilized in any other way...obviously BoxWave needs to go back to the drawing board for another look."
3,Worth what I paid for it (maybe),"Hoping to avoid smudging on my Kindle Fire screen, I purchased this stylus. In that regard it is somewhat better than using my finger. It still leaves marks on the screen--just not oily marks. No problems with functionality: It does what it is supposed to, and actually does help with selecting items/locations on the screen with greater precision. It isn't particularly comfortable to use. I find the pocket clip gets in the way when I hold it. Perhaps if the stylus was a little longer this wouldn't be such a problem. With the next stylus I purchase, I'll simply select one without the clip. That purchase will likely be in about six months, as I anticipate that as the life span for this stylus. I'm very careful with my electronic devices and accessories, but I anticipate the rubber cap popping out of the end of this stylus within a few months."
4,Cleverly thought out but...,"This stylus is clever. The attached lanyard can be connected to the earphone jack when you are not using your earphones avoiding the misplacement or loss of your stylus. The only complaint I have is the color. I bought four of these in different colors; silver,blue,red and orange. However, when I closely compared the orange and red stylus' they were very much alike in color, not at all like the description of ""Bold Orange"". Otherwise, I have no other complaints and would purchase them again."
2,Didn't last a day,"Probably a good stylus for those who don't have monsters disguised as children lurking around their house waiting to destroy everything.5 minutes after I took this out of the package, my one year old snatched it and broke the clasp holding the string on the end of it.3 hours later my three year old had bent the clip back so many times it fell off.By the end of the night my one year old had chewed the tip off.Yeah. I know, I know... ""Well YOU shouldn't have let your children use it."" That may be very true, however, I purchased my tablet to use with my children and there are many apps and books they enjoy under my close supervision. I did not encourage them to chew on the tip or bend the clip and reprimanded then when they tried.I have since purchased another brand that not only was cheaper, but is much more sturdy! I have tried to destroy one in the same manner that my children managed to destroy this one and it is much sturdier!"
3,"Dry, but adequate for business people","If you are in IT (other than upper management) and want to learn about portals, do not buy this book. However, if you are a business person/manager looking to understand what those portal things might be good for then this is the book for you. Primarily this is a book about what portals are, why they are a good thing, and rigid portal project management principals. The writing is extemely dy and repetitious (reminded me of reading The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, yawn).From the technical side of portals, well this book does not go there...at all. Look elsewhere for actual information about portal technologies, programming, etc.I gave it three stars because I believe that business managers thinking about a portal for their organization can benefit from this book."
5,A Must-Have Resource,"Any IT professional tasked with planning a corporate portal to make the most of an organization's intellectual property should read this book. Mrs. Collins offers a solid, well thought out strategy for planning, building, and implementing a portal that will ensure successful sharing of a company's most valuable asset - it's employees' knowledge.Ginni MachamerSr. Programmer AnalystKnowledge Application SystemsThe Aerospace Corporation"
1,Not so great,"I seleected this as a textbook for a college course on portal design. My students hated it, and I don't blame them.The writing is very hard to understand. The examples and processes are for very large, very complex IS shops and do not readily translate to other contexts.I based my selection in large part on the positive reviews I had read here, so I am left wondering who those reviewers are and what book they read...I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you are a CIO or senior IS manager at a large company, in which case you probably don't need it anyway."
2,Make sure you email the seller,"Make sure you email the seller first. If they are all seasons in one box they are definately bootlegg copies. If they say ""region free"" I checked and HBO has only made Soprano's DVD for Region 1. Also, HBO states they have never issued the box set of all DVD in one box. They are good buy if your not too worried about quality. But don't pay anymore than $100 for the set, they usually only cost $25 - $50. There are some buyers selling them for around $90."
1,"The Sopranos - The Complete Seasons 1 - 5 & Season 6, Part 1 (6-Pack)","Six of the 24 discs did not play properly. Some seasons did not have subtitles and the subtitiles for Season 6 did not match the script. The order was late in arriving and three times the seller, Angel Express, said that they were sending replacemnt discs but didn't. I finally reported these matters to Amazon and they issued a full refund."
1,Expensive?,It seems that either HBO or Amazon are really shaking the Sopranos fans down with this set? I live in New Zealand and have been working my through individual seasons that my local bookstore is selling for $39.95 NZD each. That works out as getting at least seasons 1 - 5 (haven't seen season 6 pt 1 for sale yet) for $150 USD?
4,Great for medium wide angle,"The lens is well priced, of reasonably fair quality, and good for adding medium width to your wide angle video shot (as in when trying to photograph the Grand Canyon) or for shooting in tight spot areas where a little more video width to the left or right might get the entire shot or group of people in without having to pan back and forth. Sometime less motion makes for a more watchable video. I concur with the previous 2007 review, I would not use the lens with a zoom shot. Other than that I would not hesitate to purchase. If you don't like the results after you receive it either return it or sell it on Amazon as like new. I do not see that you can go too far wrong. Obviously this lens is not for the professional."
3,Seems fair,"Like the Sunpak 2x tele-conversion lens, this low cost lens performs as expected for the price. It arrived in a blister pack with ring adapters that are useful if you need them. No lens covers or bag so it's difficult to keep clean. Works fine for my video needs."
2,Save Your Money,"After attempting to find the ""sweet spot"" with this antenna, using NetStumbler, I came to the conclusion the signal loss of the cable is more than offset by any possible antenna gain. The best I could get was the equivalent of the stock 3"" ducky antenna on the router. If I really needed a better S/N ratio, I'd probably going with a 9Db antenna to screw on the back of the router.This product is going into the Yard Sale bin."
1,The claims are grossly exagerated.,"The only way to boost the signal is to increase the power by 100 mW to 1W. All this will do is drain the signal of your router. The only use for this is if you work in an office you use metal cubicles and you would like to raise the antenna above the metal frames so that you can share your router/AP with others For the home, I see no application as you will lose about 5 to 10% of your signal if you put it in the same spot as your router. I actually bought one so that I can compare the different Antennas and signal boosters. You would be better off buying a longer stubby antenna so there is no signal loss. Or buy a powered Signal booster that actually has a power adapter you plug into the wall. That will actually penetrate walls better than a non powered antenna. Don't buy this, you will thank me."
1,Stock Antenna works better than this.,"I bought this with hope that I would improve the range of my Alfa AWUS036H... With my initial tests, it's worse than the antenna that came with the Alfa. Disappointing as this will go on the junk pile. The antenna unscrews from the base and it would seem that this could be reused for some other radio project. Perhaps could be used for a homebrew CAN-tenna? May be worth the $10 shipped afterall."
2,Not the results I expected,I got no better response with this product. But what should I expect for only 5 bucks. You get what you pay for...
1,for better wi fi,ordered this for boyfriend to help him play games online faster with this booster. It came 2 days past the due date and it did not help at all.
2,Good antenna but available for less,"This antenna can provide a better signal. The biggest benefit is that you can move it away from your modem which may be buried behind other equipment that blocks much of the signal.However it is available for less here:Wi-Fi WiFi Booster Antenna for Wireless LAN CARD AP SMA.Bottom line, the product is good (4-stars) but as offered here it's not a good value."
4,Good item but not what I needed.,I had read Wi-Fi and thought it would work with my router. It was a wireless cell antenna. I returned it with no problem. I was very satisfied with the seller.
3,very flimsy,not very impressed with the quality but for the price you pay for them its okI would not advice you to put it on your car though
2,No noticeable change in the connection speed.,"I installed this ""booster"" antenna on my wireless Access Point to see if it would help the connection speed with my laptop, which is about 150' away from the AP. Before installing the new antenna on the AP, I had 2 bars with the factory installed 2dbi antenna. After I installed the new antenna, I now have 2 to 3 bars on my laptop, but there isn't any noticeable connection speed difference...it still connects at 5 mbps to 11 mbps. As a result, I still cannot stream any videos. It was wasting of money for me. Based on the reviews by others, it may be a better investment to buy a high power USB wireless adapter, like GSKY High Power 500mW 27dBm 802.11b/g USB Wireless WiFi LAN Adapter With High Gain 7dBi Panel Antenna. That will be my next purchase."
1,Lowered signal,"When I first used this on my laptop inside my house, to test it out, the signal strength from my WAP dropped from 70% to 30%~. I was thinking the cable itself must be broken, but no, without any antenna my usb wireless modem barely picks up any signals.So this antenna works, just very badly. Less signal than the 5dbi black plastic antenna that came with the usb.I do use it now to pick up wireless signals while sitting in my car. But again if I step outside of the car with the laptop and switch back to the normal antenna my signal goes way up."
3,Didn't boost signal.,"I bought this for my router to try to get a better signal on my netbook. It doesn't do any better than the router's built in antenna. I'm going to try having it moved and see if that improves the signal. I think the term ""booster"" is misleading."
4,Wi Fi Booster Antenna,Not a bad Antenna for the money but not great either. It did increase my connection by 1 1/2 bars which for my purpose was acceptable.
2,"Is The keywrd ""Open Space""?","I tried to use it at home on a slimline HP pavilion. It made absolutely no difference. Its a nice enough little gizmo though I was able to try various positions/locations by a signal facing window. But this passive device made no difference. Perhaps in ""Open Space"" it can do better."
4,Booster Antenna - great product for the price,"Great product for the price. I have my tower on the floor of my office. I needed to be able to extend the wireless card antenna. This booster antenna has a very long cord and a magnetic base (was able to ""stick it"" to the metal window frame near my desk). Works great. My network connectivy was usually ""Good""; now it is always ""Very Good"" or ""Excellent""."
5,It does improve WiFi reception,I used it on one of the PCs that was getting spotty WiFi performance before. While it's not perfect the performance is measurably better: connection speed used to be around 16Mbs but it's now around 34Mbs. So it was a cheap way to boost performance. Note that you'll need to try several orientations of the antenna to get the best improvement.
5,Great Product,I added this to a SMC Barricade G router. The ability to move the antenna away from the router added a full 20% to the signal strength in my living room. I also purchased a Hawking USB WiFi adapter for my laptop but this antenna actually gave me more of a gain. If measured in signal strength gain per $ this was the better deal.
1,WASTE,"Didn't increase signal at all. Should've listened to the other reviews. Ended up buying a new router, that worked way better than this thing."
1,Waste of money,"Cons: Completely useless product. Tried it connecting directly to the router and PC, no signal boost. Pros: Don't see any."
2,Didn't get the job done,"Ordered it with the intent of extending my Linksys reception. Didn't have the appropriate connector, and it doesn't work.... This didn't work work out so well."
1,worthless,This antenna did NOTHING for my signal. I bought a new router after wasting my money on this. If you want it you can have it !!
2,did not work as well as I thought,"I bought this product thinking I could pick up signal better where I was in a downstairs apartment, but still nothing. It was able to connect one day fine, but kept getting kicked offline. It may have just been my location. I'll try it again If I ever need it and may feel differently then."
3,Works... but no better than stock,"Didn't add any range or speed to my connection vis a standard NetGear WiFi router, although it is easier to position."
3,naaaaa,"Ordered it with the intent of extending my Linksys reception. Didn't have the appropriate connector, and it doesn't work.... This didn't work work out so well."
4,Fixed the problem,"I had a particularly tough situation that this antenna worked out to be the perfect solution. Worked as advertised, was priced was right and the strong magnetic base made the installation pretty darned simple: Fab a simple metal bracket, mount it on the outside wall and plop this antenna on. Job done. Believe it or not, this was the only antenna I could find in this price range with the six foot pig tail. Oh, and the delivery was fast and cheap too. I save five star ratings for ""above and beyond"" and I tussled if I should do four or five on this product and vendor. Could have gone either way . . . but today I felt a little stingy so I gave it a four but don't let that scare you away if this little guy fits your needs. It did mine."
3,Not great...,The makeup is hard and difficult to get out of the package. The pad it comes with doesn't work. Poor color selection.
3,Innovative but rough around the edges,"I was attracted to this book because I read Stephen Mohr's earlier book designing distributed apps a few years ago. This book doesn't disappoint if you're (deep) into XML / network applications and architecture. Although it is stimulating and provides several eye-openers, I could only reward this book 3 stars because it is way too Microsoft / .NET centric. If you don't have a full scale, recent Microsoft box running, you'll need to download all kinds of .Net (framework) stuff. On top of that, the samples do not run with all installations of msxml (I only got them going by installing msxml3sp2). Major headache, wasted quite a bit of time on this because of the cryptic microsoft debugging info - almost made me throw the book out of the window. Next time a python version please!"
2,Poorly written bore,"I enjoyed the first two books in this new Shadowrun series (both by Stephen Kenson) but I am afraid this third entry, which closes off the Kellan Colt story, is a poorly constructed and badly written mess.A lot of the book is padding and it's clear there's not really a lot of story to it. Lots of boring things happen and numerous, generic characters appear doing all sorts of uninteresting things. Lots of deception, backstabbing, plotting and truckloads of pure exposition but none of it engaging in the slightest.I think that this has actually put me off the rest of the Shadowrun books. A shame, really."
3,Not what expected!,"The first time I heard these Silvio's songs (about 12 years ago) a very special atmosphere was created from the combination of the melancholic and some times energic tunes of his guitar and the lack of quality of those recordings in the post-revolutionary Havana. I hoped this CD would be a compilation of those early works, remastered and ensambled with that atmosphere untouched. Instead of that I found Silvio trying to sing those old and beautiful songs with new music arrangements and a voice which doesn't reach the difficult tones of the original ones.I still admire his temple and are very grateful for his effort to rescue those songs and, in a way, those days of past glory."
1,Une merveille,Ce double CD est génial ! Comme on dit chez nous : chic et pas cher. Je suis un grand fan de musique cubaine et ce Silvio Rodriguez se classe dans le top 5 de ma collection.Je ne comprends toujours pas pourquoi on ne trouve pas d'extraits musicaux d'un tel artiste et particulièrement cette dernière réalisation sur Amazon. Pour ma part j'ai acheté les yeux fermés et je ne le regrette pas.Viva Cuba y viva Silvio.
4,Lego Star Wars Episode 3:Ultimate Lightsaber Duel,"Hello,first of all I am an Episode 1 collecter.This happens to be my first episode 3 set.It wasn`t so entertaining(or atleast what they suggest us to do).This set however has a features.Here are the minifigures:Obi-Wan Kenobi(jedi master,hood,light-up)Anakin Skywalker(jedi master,light-up)Here are the features:Battle(move around the handle and move platforms)Lightsaber light-up(press down head)Pros:Light-up minifiguresCons:Way to boringOverall:The minifigures outrank the whole set.Side Note:Read my episode 1 set reviews.They get better credit :D"
2,Dark Mattter is an evil alien Plot?,This novel is the second in a trilogy.Asimov must be rolling in his grave.The only fresh thing is is making the idea of dark matter being all around popular?I have to admit I've read worse Star Trek novels:this level of sci fi reminds one of serial movies of the 1930's.The plots aren't original or the content of any quality.
3,An Okay Book,"Poster's work is basically about how Foucault and other poststructuralists are great in understanding phenomena of the ""past."" Unfortunately, the crux of his argument doesn't appear until the final chapters where he reads (and misreads) de Certeau and Foucault. It's good that he tries to cross disciplinary boundaries, but his reading and articulation of ""cultural history"" is just too narrow."
1,Clueless Francophile Jargon,"Yet another tiresome volume devoted to post-everything pseudo-disciplines. Poster has almost nothing original to say, but that doesn't stop him. Read on, if you must, to be regailed yet again with clueless francophile jargon about our postmodern, post-colonial, post-structurlist, post-disciplinary society and you just may go postal."
5,The perfect antidote to Outliers,"The perfect antidote to Outliers, this book demonstrates the unavoidable pitfalls to attempting the lifestyle espoused by Outliers. It is possible to be successful AND happy, but not unless you make happiness a goal that you manage as vigorously as you manage success. This is written by a psychologist for the stars, and is filled with both easy to remember anecdotal stories and sound principals which I have observed in the people I consider fabulously successful and yet still completely grounded and approachable."
1,worst in the world,"The worst popcorn in the world! At one time this might have started out as popcorn but the product I received was as stale as if it were extracted from King Tuts tomb. What was supposed to be cheddar cheese was some alien goo that seemed to be spray painted on creating a coating for this stale mushy 'stuff' that was billed as Double Cheddar Gourmet popcorn. I did contact Cornzapoppin and they have ignored my concern. Garrett's of Chicago is a far better product that arrives with crunch, and at a better price."
2,Didn't work for me,"I used the product as directed on a trans-Atlantic trip, both directions. I don't know how I would have felt if I had not taken the product, but unfortunately, for me, it wasn't the silver bullet many have said it was for them. I have had uneven experiences with homeopathic products, some worked for me, some didn't. It was worth a try for me. Since everyone reacts to such products differently, I am not giving it the poorest rating. It may be worth a try for you."
3,Not sure,"I used this on a flight to Paris. My Jet Lag was not bad, but my husband did not use anything and felt about the same. Probably wouldn't buy it again."
3,How do you take this every two hours?,I have two trips to Asia (from the US) planned in the next two months and another to Europe. The directions say to take it every two hours. Am I really supposed to wake up from sleeping on the plane (17+ hour flights!) to take the pill?
4,seems to work,"Just returned from 10 days in Italy and didn't want to waste any time in a jet-lag fog. Took according to package directions and didn't have overwhelming fatigue or long sleepless nights. No side effects noted, so probably worth a try."
1,I knew it was too good to be true!,I knew it was too good to be true! And it was. I took it as directed on my trip and actually experienced WORSE jet lag that ever before. Will not be recommending nor purchasing again. Total waste of money.
1,waste of money,waste of money. get slipping pills instead to go to sleep on time and stay asleep through the night after a long flight.
4,"Seemed to work, could just be placebo effect","I hate to burn a vacation day walking around like a zombie after an intercontinental flight, so I gave these a try. They did seem to reduce my jet lag. They taste suspiciously like the sugar pills I used to keep in my wilderness kit to offer folks suffering from something you couldn't really treat with meds (""take one of these, it'll help your bunion""). But even if it's just a placebo effect, that's still good enough for me. So read some of the glowing reviews, convince yourself these things work, and hit the ground running when you arrive."
4,No Jet Lag,"Apart from the inconvenience of having to chew this every two hours on the flight, the results were amazing. The usual tiredness and fatigue that comes with a trans-pacific flight was not there. I was back to normal the very day I touched down in Asia from the West Coast of US."
1,Ruined my career,"I took this after a transcontinental flight. The next day, I fell asleep and was late to the very important conference I was attending. I'm still jet lagged."
4,"Nice, but all 3 are not made by Yamaha","The recorders seem to be fine. I was a little concerned when all of them didn't have the Yamaha name on them. One says Alfred instead of Yamaha. Hopefully, this doesn't mean the quality is going to be different. As far as I can tell, they seem to be fine."
1,Misleading Picture,I was expecting 3 pieces (although one recorder breaks into 3 pieces for cleaning purposes) because of the picture and received only one. The picture is very misleading.
3,It's OK...,"I ordered the blue one for my daughter as that's her favorite color. But she couldn't produce consistent sound. I tried it myself and the notes were a bit off. It's ok as a toy... Well for the price, I can't complain though."
5,Amazing Value,"I recently took up recorder playing and fell into playing with my school's choir. I needed an instrument that sounded half decent, but I didn't want to spend a ton on a more expensive wooden recorder. I decided to buy this one, and I have been nothing but pleased with it. It sounds as good as a plastic recorder possibly can and breaks into three pieces for easy cleaning. If you need a good recorder and are stingy (much like me) buy this. You will not be upset!"
4,TRULY ANOINTING AT BEST!!,This collection is worth buying and at such a great price! The second dvd was absolutely the best. Whenever you feel discouraged this is a great way to come out of it. Karen Clark-Sheard and Vanessa Bell-Armstrong was amazing. What a treat!
4,GREAT JOB!!!,"I purchased the Act II edition and I must say that I have totally enjoyed the musice ministry. I can't stop watching the part on the song ""It's Your Time"" which showcases ""KAREN CLARK SHEARD"". I have to say that she really ministered to my spirit.Thanks Tri City and Donald. Stay Blessed!!!!"
3,esperada edicion,"ya era hora que esta adorable edicion de villancicos navideños fuera editada en la lengua española, muy buena traduccion"
4,A beautiful and thoughtful book!,"Isabel Anders describes soul moments as ""times when heaven touches earth--are here and now, in the thick of things, sometimes occurring as we are most aware of our human limitations and confusion.""Anders' beautiful and vivid prose lights up the pages of Soul Moments with her life experiences as she offers the reader the many ways our daily lives overlap and meet God. She challenges us, with her stories, to examine God's hand in not just our daily journey, but in our past and future experiences.Armchair Interviews says: Soul Moments is a beautiful and thoughtful read. It's a wonderful addition to daily devotions, will contribute to thoughts about the reader's journey and will be a comfort in the difficult life moments. We recommend it."
4,cute,"my daughter wanted a pink recorder. my only suggestion is that it should include the stick used to clean it, had to go buy one"
5,Perfect for school!!!,"Great quality, beautiful color. The price is just perfect for this recorder. It arrived in three days, super fast. I am very pleased with this product."
5,Pretty Recorder,This was just what my daughter needed for her recorder class at school and she is definitely the coolest 4th grade girl around with a pink recorder!
5,PINK!!,It's just what my daughter wnated and was cheaper even with shipping than the stores around my home.
5,Pink Recorder,I ordered this for my grand daughter who loves pink. It's really cute. She's only 5 but is showing an interest in music. I will give it to her for her birthday. Delivery was fast!
5,"Great sounding, incredibly cheap instrument","Got this for my daughter, but I'm a wind player so I've played it some.The intonation on this ""cheap"" instrument is very impressive. Also the sound quality is quite good for plastic. Plus, the see-thru pink is really cool (it comes in other translucent colors too).For the money you can't go wrong."
4,Good ideas!,"I bought copies of this for my Mom and myself and we're both experimenting with it. Not all the recipes are great but enough are to enjoy the book and use it a lot. We've probably tried half of them in the past year, as we learn how to incorporate more soy in our diets. Most ingredients are easy to find nowadays.We especially like the soups, the sauses and some of the desserts, although French Toast, Tofu Lasagna and Tofu Stroganoff are among our favorites."
3,Not as well plotted as Season 1,I watch primarily for the sight of Ciaran Hinds and find Kelly Reilly distracting (I like her better as Mrs. Watson). Somehow this plot did not come together for me.
1,misleading,"This is not season 2 you are advertising - it is season one. Please correct this. I almost purchased it, and we have already seen season one. Thank you."
3,Double Check the Red Dahlia,"I believe that the 3 part Red Dahlia mystery is referred to as season 2. This is a bit misleading, since it directly follows the Pilot. Be careful that you do not buy it twice.It is very graphic with realistic corpses. Not for younger viewers or the least bit squeamish. The series relies more on character interplay than mystery.Good acting with an interesting mix of characters. Ciarn Hinds plays the experienced police detective in a believable manner. Kelly Reilly is by turns engaging and frustrating off as a novice detective. The hit and miss performance could have added to the feel of a novice learning, but didn't quite get there. The director seems to concentrate on her charms far more than on getting a good performance out of her.The 3 part Deadly Intent followed by the 3 part Silent Scream come next."
4,Highly enjoyable series,The writing was excellent and the acting was quite good. The only thing I feel could have been better would have been a bit more depth to the female lead. I don't know if that was the director or the actor. It was well worth watching and I would have gladly watched more episodes.
1,very gory,"I only started the first episode,was bloody and not the kind of show l like maybe it gets better,,very violence and shocking show,not for me"
4,Boot Slick,This product makes your boots slip on much easier than would otherwise be the case. Depending on how tight they are you may have to use it each time you take the boots off. The online price is better than at a local store if you can even find the product at a local store. Spray it on the inside of the boot after you take your boots off or otherwise allow it to dry before you try putting on the boots !
1,Poor quality,"I too broke one of the contacts while installing the bulb. Actually, I purchased a pack of 10 and had more than one break."
2,Noisy when used on a dimmer,"We have two 12V pendant fixtures above the stove, and one has a Sylvania 12V/50W bulb, the other one of these.Standing between them, there is a distinct buzz coming from the Higuchi.Might be from the Lutron dimmer switch, but doesn't matter. The other bulb is silent.Not good for quiet spaces or places where humans hang out."
1,BURN OUT WITHIN TWO WEEKS,I am installing these bulbs in an RV both interior and exterior. It is hard to access the fixtures and change the bulbs and then they burn out within two weeks...
1,Overly Fragile Product,"Like another reviewer of this product, I broke the bulb installing it. It should be more duarble, it didn't take much pressure for it to break."
3,halogen lamp,"I irdered the lamp before I was sure I wanted it. I was just trying to see the total cost including shipping. I did not think it would be ordered until I entered my Credit card number but they used the same number as aI had previously used. I brke the lamp trying to install it so there was no benefit, only a waste of time.Ralpgh Briscoe"
3,Do not buy this wheel,"The wheel is ok, but the 34 dollars they charge to send it to you is out of sight. It could easily fit in a 5 dollar USPO priority box."
3,It's alright. Not the best for the lipgloss lover in you're life.,"I love lipglosses and Jessica Simpson's dessert line and was so excited to try this. This product came in a long generous tube with the 'Dessert Beauty' logo on the front. Very pretty and exquisite. I give 2 stars for that alone.I was dissapointed with the fact that hardly anything came out on the applicator when you tried to pull the applicator out of the tube. I had to use 4-5 swipes, when in most lipglosses I only need 1 or 2 swipes on the lips. This smells and tastes good, however, I just was very dissapointed in the amount of lipgloss aspect. As far as lasting power goes, this wasn't that great. It lasted about 2 hours WITH my glossy chapstick underneath.If you love strong lipglosses, pigmented lipglosses, or just a lot of product type of lipglosses, this isn't for you. But if you want a sheer coverage- it does it's job decently. (However you're better off paying $1.00 on a E.l.f lipgloss than this more expensive failure.)"
5,Excellent for starter students,"This book provides practice questions and is a simple and thorough introduction. Highly recommended. If you have any desire to learn Korean, start here."
4,Terrific book with plenty of examples and exercises.,"This textbook is very well-organized and makes studying fun. I would give it 5 stars, but there are no answer keys, so I couldn't check whether I solved the exercises right."
1,no answers,"what good is a text with no answers? I found the book almost unusable, as I study by myself. There was no way to check my answers. I emailed the publisher, and they said there were no answers or teacher's book. Can not recommend a book like this."
1,Where's the audio?,This book comes with NO audio. NO tape. NO CD. How can you ship a beginning language book with no audio?
5,Great book for students learning Hangul,"There are seven chapters in this book and they have topics related to being a college student or being in korea. Some of the chapters cover these topics, =Korean Language Class, My Day, The Weekend, In Seoul etc... I never took a formal Korean class, and I found this book very straight forward and easy to understand. I like how even tho this is a beginners class they already force you to read and write in Korean from the first chapter. Not much use of romanized Korean words which is great.Appendix is also adds some everyday important terms like counters, honorific expressions, realitves, numbers etc. Over all very good. I showed this to my korean friend and she was happy haha.."
5,Best place to start learning Korean,A very simple and easy to follow book with step by step teaching.The examples are placed at just the right places and are easy to follow. Though translations in a few places at least at the start of the book would be really helpful.All in all an excellent purchase for someone who is planning on learning the language.
4,Excellent Textbook,"This is an excellent textbook, especially with the support of the MP3 audio files on this website:http://languagelab.bh.indiana.edu/korean101.htmlThe book could explain grammatical structures better or extend other explanations to make it for people who self study. I suppose it's designed to be used with a teacher."
5,Best Product I Have See So Far,"I have several Learning Korean Books, but Integrated Korean is by far the best, and, in fact, the only Korean language course that connects the islands of learning I have had so far. It goes slow and repeats the material just enough (for me) to get it. I do only self study, so I do not need the workbooks, and since my wife is Korean, I do not need the accompanying audio.I think Korean is too hard for someone to learn without help in any case, so even Integrated Korean may not be sufficient for someone just starting out without any Korean language exposure and without a teacher."
3,Good book but not correct in some places...,I bought this book for my friend to learn with. Its good to learn with someone who knows Korean. It would be very hard to study by yourself. Some prounciation is incorrect. When they explain the letters in the beginning some are incorrect. Its a very good book unlike others because in the rest it shows you words and phrases in korean.
1,Too much useless information,"I'm Korean and bought this to brush up on my language skills. Half the book is filled with a stupid introduction that has nothing to do with the language. The remaining portion teaches things you can learn on television. This is a commercial book for people who want to have it in their bookshelf to show off. This is not a good book to learn from. They don't even have the alphabets listed together on one page that can serve as a reference for writing skills!!!!!!! If you don't have something as basic as that, the glossary in the back isn't going to help you out very much. Returned the book as an unsatisfied customer. Don't get this book - waste of time and money (lost shipping costs)."
1,For classroom only!!,This book seems easy at first but then you realize that not only do you need audio files(hard to find and out of order)but that you also use this book as an ACTUAL TEXTBOOK in a classroom taking a Korean Course. Because of that you really can't use it by yourself.
2,Not very bright,"The product description is incorrect. The light wattage is 0.7 watts as listed on the package, not 7 watts as in the Amazon description. A 7 watt LED light should be very bright. These are not. The light is about as bright as a night light."
2,Quite Dissappointed,"Bought this on some screaming deal quite awhile ago. But in the end it wasn't very good, it wasn't spicy (i mean really it's tabasco brand and called ""spicy pepper..."", you'd expect spicy) and had High fructose corn syrup as one of the ingredients. Wouldn't order it again and not even sure i'd take it if it were free."
5,Never Die,These old classics are full of richness and never get old! Even my youngest giggled so; a rare thing for her.
5,Great old movies,It's nice to be able to get a copy of these oldies but goodies. They just don't make them like they used to.
4,Great Movies,I had seen two of these movies A Night at the Opera and Father of the Bride (the original I have seen the one with Steve Martin). The other two are a couple of my favorite movies.They are all great movies and will provide hours of emjoyment.
4,A note on subtitles,"The movies were great!! I have more comments about how they were packaged because it was different that I had expected.I bought these for my elderly mother who lives with me, so my review is based on using these for a senior person.The titles were in extremely tiny print stamped around the center hole. Very hard to read.The subtitles were created in white w/o a black box around them -- this made it hard to read them -- especially if the film was black and white!! Most subtitles come with a black box in which the subtitle is reversed out to white -- same as the TV -- which makes it much easier to read. Caring for a senior makes me much more aware of all the small things that affect their independence. Ease of use, larger type on the packaging and a visually enhanced subtitle would improve the use of these for that population immensely. Thanks!!"
4,Greatest Classic Films Collection: Comedy,"I love Arsenic and Old Lace! My daughters (16 years old & 22 years old) watched it with me and thoroughly enjoyed it. My youngest thought Cary Grant was ""hot"". Father of the Bride is priceless and The Long Long Trailer is a hoot! I haven't watched ""A Night at the Opera"" yet. Great DVD! Good clean family fun. Arsenic and Old Lace is a rather dark and morbid for young children. You are dealing with murder (several of them). I would say no one younger than 12 years old just because of the dark humor."
5,Loving these TCM collections!,"So far I have only watched ""the Long, Long Trailer"" and I love it! The quality is great and the storyline is fun. It is a huge helping of nostalgia at it's best. I can't wait to watch the other movies."
2,"Great actors, not great story lines","My family is a big fan of old classics and actors such as Lucille Ball and Cary Grant. However, we found these films to be funny, on the depressing side. The humor was related to bad situations rather than funny lines."
1,very disappointed,"there is suppose to be 2 movies on each disc, but there is only 1 movie on each disc, A BIG RIP OFF!"
3,Good for beginers,"This book does a very good job of introducing you to this powerful e-mail tool. However, it doesn't adequatly explain some of the more advanced groupware/scheduling features of Outlook 2000. Look elsewhere for this type of info."
2,Not at the right level for me,"I can see this being an appropriate book for some but I ended up reading half of this book, not learning much new, and then giving up. I had used Outlook for about 1 year before picking this up and was hoping to take my knowledge of the software to a new level. It seemed to spend way too much time explaining straightforward stuff. It's not that I mind having this stuff explained, it just seemed the author went into stuff in exasperating detail (which may be for some). Even if I was a beginner I would prefer something more concise."
5,"Great pacing, atmoshere and characters","The novel captures the dual nature of modern Native Americanlife: tradition vs progress. What makes the story wonderful is the realistic characterizations, the descriptions of Wyoming countryside and the crisp pacing. Add to all this a story with as many twists and turns as a dark country road, and ""The Eagle Catcher"" becomes one of the best stories to be published in the last few years."
2,Painful,"This is a decent enough story, and the material about Arapaho culture and tradition is interesting, but the writing is simply not good. The author seems to string one cliche after another into her text. I can't recommend these books to anybody who cares about good writing. The author is yet another Tony Hillerman wannabe, and she doesn't measure up."
4,Good but a bit slow,The Arapaho customs are interesting. The book is well written but a bit on the slow side. I think the problem may be that the main character is not all that interesting. I'd like some oomph here. Another problem is that it is clear who the villain is about 1/4 of the way through the book. I think a little suspense would help.
5,A New Western Master,"This is a first in a new series set in the Western US. It centres around an Arapaho reservation. The principal characters are a Jesuit priest and an Arapaho lawyer. The story itself is well written, the plot moves along at a good pace. The clues are fairly given, allowing the reader to follow along with the protagonist. If there is one thing that I found a little sterotypical was that all that the white people, with one exception, are out to rip off the Natives. I have no doubt that this goes on and went on. Yet, it would be better to have a mix, such as in the Tony Hillerman works. Still, an excellent read and an author I would continue to read."
1,Save your money for the real deal,"If you want the genuine burgess bits Make sure they say the burgess edge on them cuz if you don't you might save a few bucks but you'll be disappointed like I was and end up getting the originals from Micheal Burgess himself. If you order them off amazon make sure they say the burgess edge, or you'll get his rejects. The real thing works great."
5,Flannery Would Be Proud,"My hat is off to all the writers who contributed to this book which celebrates the 75th anniversary of Flannery O'Connor's birth. Every piece is a unique glimpse into what O'Connor has meant to so many writers and to so many readers. I was forutnate enough to be in Milledgeville for the launch of this book-David Bottoms, Sarah Gordon, Bret Lott, Greg Johnson, and Kellie Wells--thank you for your readings that day. CHEERS."
5,"VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD","IN THE FIRST EPISODE, WHOOPIE GOLDBERG IS THE ONLY THING THAT IS ANY GOOD. THE SECOND ONE IS EXCELLENT. BRAD DOURIF GIVES AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE IN THIS VERY COMEDIC EPISODE, WITH BILL PAXTON AS WELL. THE THIRD IS VERY GOOD AS WELL, IT HAS NO TWISTED SHOCK ENDING, AND DOESNT EVEN HAVE A VERY GOOD STORY, BUT IS STILL ENTERTAINING, ESPECIALLY WITH CATHY MORIARTY, SHE IS EXCELLENT. END"
5,Love it.,Since none of the grocery stores carry it anymore i have to buy it online. Great item we love it.
4,"Great Hits Collection, But There's More Where This Came From","If you just want a nice collection of some of the greatest hits, this collection does a nice job of giving you just that...The duo has started their own record label and have re-released two of their rare Warner Brothers albums on cd (avalible on cd for the first time ever). The releases include their very first album for Warner Brothers titled ""Gimme Something Real"" and their last Warner's album ""Performance"" which was a live recording with additional studio material. Both cds include the original art work, and could easily be considered collectors items. Once again, if you want the hits, check this cd out, and if you want more be sure to stop by the duo's official web site."
4,It's worth your money!,"Along with full length versions of Ashford & Simpson's biggest hits, ""Somebody Told A Lie"" from 1976's ""Come As You Are"" makes its CD debut on this collection. Warner Records tracks such as ""So So Satisfied"", ""Over and Over"", plus more cuts from Ashford & Simpson's stay at Capitol would have been nice, yet it's a very satisfying set. Combine this one with Capitol's compilation and you'll just about have the two CD set this soulful couple deserved."
2,"Outside of Solid and Street Walker, it covers old material","Talented, so skilled in writing lyrics and music for themselves and others...not my mix of songs for this one as I am their 80's fan."
3,fine,"nothing special, but I like the instructor. There is a lot more to belly dancing than I thought. You really need to see the moves from a different angle and need an explanation of which muscles are being used for each move. The dance in this DVD is fun to do. I didn't think I was moving that much but before I knew it I was sweating. So it's a good alternative workout to have in my collection. I think I'll have to sign up for real classes if I want to know how to really belly dance though."
5,And How!!,"I was railroaded into watching the first Trigun by an old friend, but was instantly hooked. I enjoyed the way that the show went from just silly to very deep. This was the climax. Every episode is emotionally charged, and the ending is really unexpected. It is also left open. I sorta wish that I clouda seen more of knives - i liked him better than Lagato anyways."
3,To all good things...,"Unfortunately, like a lot of Anime's these days, this series ended in a horrible fashion.The entire show is done exquisitely, with a masterful story and characters you really get to know. (Frankly, when my favorite one died I almost cried.) You find yourself tossed into their world and finding yourself knowing little facts about it: A definite pleaser for any Otaku's palette. It keeps one coming back for more.However, this final chapter in the saga of the Humanoid Typhoon really squashes all the work the authors did by simply ending the show on nothing more than a thought that doesn't really coincide with how the show ""worked"". It also leaves several questions unanswered about the series, questions which were prevelant themes throughout.But still, this is one of my favorite shows so I had to give it 3 stars for its precedence... for its greatness in characters... for love and peace ^_^ -V.."
5,The whole series,This series sets a higher standard for other anime.. I was never bored when I watched it.. I highly recommend this series to everyone!! Buy it now!
5,High Noon,"I love this series and I can watch it again and again.. This was the finale of the series, unfortunately.. Wolfwood dies, which ..., because he's just starting to get close (in that way) to Milly. And now she's all alone to watch Vash and Meryl get together... Anyways, it was really good. I especially liked the gunfight between Vash and Knives. It was so awesome, you will watch it over and over. Vash overtakes knives and tosses his gun and red coat aside, to carry his brother over his shoulder back home, and start a new ""normal"" life. He didn't kill him, he wants to 'save' him.. Good luck I say! All in all, it is a must have if you have been following the series.. You will not be disappointed, except to the fact that the series has come to a close..... -Sephariel"
1,It's been over a month since release ...,"and my preorder of Trigun - High Noon hasn't even shipped. Other than that, I'd like to say that Trigun started out pretty good, then went downhill from there. I'll be waiting for my shipment to give a final opinion.-Angry Customer"
4,Good ending to a great series,"Trigun is the best anime series I've seen since Neon Genesis, even better in some respects... except the ending.Although as I said it was a ""good"" ending, it doesn't come close to Evangellion's (the movie ending that comes out in the states in late October 2001, but that I've already seen thanks to a low quality dubbed VHS tape I managed to track down after hearing that it existed). If you want to see a great ending, wait for Neon Genesis on October 31, 2001 (or so that is what Manga says...)."
3,Nice but not what I expected,"First off, it is not as the picture! it has a matte finish not glossy...Then they are shorter than I expected and not that red....but on the plus side it works fine, always wanted a pepper mill :)"
3,Not red!,"These are nice but do not expect them to be red. They are a reddish-brown stained wood. I was hoping for a brighter red color. Also, you are supposed to be able to get coarse-ground pepper by turning the knob one way, and fine-ground pepper by turning it the other way. However, either way I turn the knob, the pepper is medium-ground."
5,Very Stylish and Useful,Received product in a timely manner. Quality of product was good. Product performed well in the purpose that it was ordered for. Thanks
2,Not what it appears to be,"The S&P are not glossy red, more of a stain. The S worked OK but the P would only grind extremely fine and could not be adjusted. I should have believed the reviews already published, never would have bought 'em."
1,BIG MISTAKE,I felt I got ripped badly buying this used to the bone product. I was stunned to find it was two years old. The warranty was used up. It was an expensive lesson never to buy an unknown outfit doing business with AMAZON. I wrote many complaints to everyone. Accessories that came with the laptop were wrong for the series. A Hewlitt Packard rep told me i basically got a good kick in the teeth. If I want to buy a laptop that is used but refurbished to new like I should always buy from the maker. It was an awful disappointment. It also was not what was described in the description.
2,problems with software,I bought this laptop at frys for a great price but I've had problems since I've had it. I work with graphic programs and my after effects will not launch nor will my stand alone zacwerks animator pro. I had it to long to return it (xmas present) so I'm stuck. I've been searching the web to see if they have any problems with it. Think twice before you buy this laptop. The only plus is that it does run fast and multitasking is good.
2,LumiSource Floor Lamp not as advertised,"I was disappointed when I received my LumiSource floor lamp. It only had five sconces when the picture showed six. One sconce was broken in shipping. Additionally, the quality was not as good as my friends, which may indicate that LumiSource has lowered thier quality."
2,Not Durable,This lamp lasted no time. The bottom of the lamp detached from the base within a few months of not even moving the lamp-and bulbs burn out quickly and are expensive for this product.
5,Great lamp that lasts,"We bought this lamp at a shop six or seven years ago and have used it consistently since then. It's never given us any trouble. (Compared to a couple others that we've picked up at box stores that were poorly made and are already gone.)It's very stable. Like the previous reviewer said, its very nice about staying where you position it, so you can point it to different focal points in the room. We're now re-decorating the room and the colors don't match our new setup, so we're just ordering different shades and will continue to use this lamp. It's a good lamp; if you like the style, get it."
2,Info for Shade Glass Replacement,The 6 lamp version is unstable and likely to fall. When it falls the glass shades over bulb breaks. Scones or glass shade for bulb are available at [...] [...]. $10 plus shipping for each one.
5,Colorful Lighting,I really like the Medusa Floor Lamp that I ordered. I like the ability to take one or more of the lights and put as much light where it's needed most needed. I'm glad I found it on Amazon
5,Mrs. Grass Homestyle Chicken Noodle with Modifications,"I totally agree with the positive comments already made about this soup mix. I also have a very hard time getting it in San Diego, CA, but luckily have relatives in Cleveland, OH who purchase for me at ALDI's and mail it to me. Over time I have modified the package instructions as follows:To extend the volume of broth I use 6 cups water and 4 cups low salt organic chicken broth. I add 2 leeks, 2 celery stalks, 4 carrots - all finely chopped plus 1/2 cup cooked orzo pasta (takes 9 minutes while you're preparing soup) I use approximately 2 cups of fresh rotisserie chicken, shredded or 12 Trader Joe's pre-cooked frozen turkey meatballs. Just drop the frozen meatballs in the broth and simmer all for 60 minutes. Just before serving add 2-3 tablespoons of Worcestershire Sauce and chopped Italian flat leaf parsley - stir and serve.You will NOT be disappointed."
3,Was great for the 8 years it worked,"We bought the unit new from the Sony Store 8 years ago and when I went to program my new slingbox, the unit does not turn on anymore... DOA...Back in the day 8 years ago was top of the line, but being DOA after 8 years of moderate use (only played about 100 movies through the unit), the unit is useless..However, I am now going to saving up to buy the replacement 400 Blue Ray unit...."
3,Longevity,Product arrived as per schedule. Although the product worked perfectly it suddenly stopped working and i still havent been able to fine the dvd it was playing.
1,Not kidding about the interface,"Have to echo the other reviews. I had myself convinced this would be a great unit, only to find that Sony really missed the boat. User interface is terrible. Not enough characters to label disks without using somekind of shorthand. Got so disgusted I sent it back."
1,Okay when it works,"While I agree with the other folks, the interface is a klunky and manually entering a large number of discs is a pain, the biggest beef with this unit is the customer service.After having my unit for only 2 months, I turned it on, [CLICK], [BANG], [CLICK] ... not good sounds! After unloading all the discs, I find a part of the transport had physically broken. All I did was turn the unit on.I sent the unit back to Sony to be repaired. After a month(!), they figure out that they can't repair it and have to replace it, fine....another month later and I'm still waiting for the replacement. How can it take 2+ months to replace a unit? So much for watching movies with the kids over the holidays.I used to say Sony was the best ... now ... if it works, it's good. If not, you're in trouble."
3,Scratching my discs?,"After reading all the complaints about this unit scratching their discs, I went home and pulled out the disc I have played the most. I found very lite circular scratches near the center of the disc. This disc was brand new and in pristine condition when I installed it. I then pulled out many more discs and could not find any other damage. I will discontinue using this unit if I see any more damage. Other than that, I really like the unit. I don't know why others are having a problem with explorer. I think it's great. The two things I don't like is the fact that you can't view explorer without stopping play and that it doesn't display song titles. Even if I had to type them in myself, would be better than nothing."
5,very good! great features,perfect for holding and repeated viewing of various dvds.. no more swapping in and out... what a pain it is!great features... i love the search feature... fast forward and then release the button to continue playing....
3,Full Tilt Glory,"Excellent quality picture and sound..but as echoed in other reviews...do a list (paper)...loaded about 240 dvd's recognized 31..one of which, the store bought movie(not a copy) ""Glory"" showed up as ""Full Tilt Boogie"" and because no overwrite capabilities we forever be know as such...no offence to any civil war vets out there..."
3,"It's good, but it can be better","The Sony DVP-CX985V disk player is pretty darn good for the price. There are a couple of things that bug me. 1st is the user menu. It needs to be more user intuitive. 2nd is the changing speed, if it was slightly faster and quieter it would be nicer. 3rd and most importantly, is that I wished it can upscale DVD video to 1080i component video output like the Zenith DVB318 DVD player. This feature alone would make this DVD player one of the most awesome DVD jukebox ever built. Can you hear me Sony?"
1,"DESTROYS DISCS, BACKUP YOUR HOME MOVIES",I CANNOT BELIEVE NOBODY IS WRITING TO COMFIRM THAT THIS PLAYER WILL LEAVE GOUGES IN SOME OF YOUR DVD DISCS MAKING THEM UNPLAYABLE AND UNABLE TO COPY. I'VE OWNED THIS PLAYER FOR 2 YEARS AN ONLY RECENTLY SAW A REVIEW WARNING THIS MIGHT HAPPEN AND IT HAS. THE PLAYER WILL SAY DISC IS DIRTY AND AFTER CLEANING THE PLAYER STILL SAYS DISC DIRTY THEN ON INSPECTION YOU'LL SEE THESE HALF MOON SCRATCHES AROUND THE EDGE. PLEASE DO NOT PUT YOUR HOME MOVIES IN WITHOUT A BACK-UP COPY STORED!!!
2,Don't Bother,"The user interface blows chunks. Finding a disc is difficult. There are no page up/down capabilities and only 5 titles are displayed at a time... try scrolling one at a time though hundreds of titles or typing the slot number to get around. The whole point of this player is to manage a large number of DVDs; they missed the boat. You cannot override the title of movies so if you want to sort them alphabetically, you are stuck with the title that was supplied on the disc (some are all upper case, some titles start with ""The"" so they sort to the T's, some are too long for the tiny space they provide). The software could never have been tested because some menu choices simply don't work at all, like the ability to turn off auto play when power is turned on. Finally, the thumbnail image capture is terrible. The thumbnails that are supplied on about 1 in 20 discs are good, but the ones you capture yourself are grainy and indistinguishable. I am sending mine back."
2,"-sob- my poor, poor DVDs","It's true. It's ALL true. Then menu is too slow like veryone says, but I decided to live with it do to the amount of discs it holds. But the unacceptable part is that this player has a defect that destroys discs! I have over 300 DVDs in mine and I've lost at least 1/3 of them to deep scratchs that occur INSIDE the player during use. When I say deep, I mean they came out with curled plastic hanging off the end of the grooved that was cut by the Sony demon. My advice is suffer with a changer that holds fewer discs. This one will only destroy your property!"
2,"Great For DVD's, NOT CD's","I bought this unit to replace 2 Sony 200 cd only disc players. This model was only $125 more than the 400 cd player, so i went with it. The menu funtions are terrible!!!! They are way over complicated and irritating. And if you just wanna play cd's you have to enter th cd# and then wait for the player to recognize the cd before you can select a track. It is a time consuming annoyance. If you want to use the shuffle or program features you have to use the menu on you TV. You can't just push a button and go. This player is a huge disapointment, but i'm too lazy to remove all my cd's and take it back."
3,"Nice features, but POOR error tracking","Have had this unit for a couple of weeks now. It is loaded with some nice features, but it is REALLY pathetic when it comes to playing less than 100% perfect disks. I mean, C'mon, can't Sony get ANYTHING right??? For the money, it's a nice unit. Holds 400 disks, plays DVD and CD, has all the audio and video features you would want, but it's REALLY pathetic when half the disks you play, that have NO problem playing on any other machine, skip or don't play at all because of the slightest dust speck or fingerprint. How long has Sony been making CD players now??? There always seems to be problems with anything Sony. They just will never be anything more than a mid-grade manufacturer. Also not thrilled that most of the menus and screens are only visible on the TV, so you can't set many of the CD features without using your television. Also, unlike their 300 CD changer, the Text only displays the Disk Title, not the tracks."
4,Sony DVP-CX975V,"I have purchased the earlier model which holds 300 discs from Amazon. I had picked this model as it can play both sides of the DVD. I burn my own DVDs and buy double sided DVDs. This player plays any type of media DVD,VCD,CD,MP3. Picture is good and this can be easliy upgraded to All Region player by buying a kit from internet. Disc selection is slow and I have made an Excel file for the quick review. THis way I do not have to go to the menu to look a t the disc. Overall not a bad player for the money. This upgraded model should have similar performance."
4,"Interesting,Mysterious, Fast Read!!","This book was a mystrious,and interesting read. The book is about a cat named Pete. Pete can read and write. He thinks he can talk in english so the humans can understand him but he can only talk in cat language. The story is many about how Pete catches the burglars who robbed his house AND stole his ""person"". In the end, the robbers get caught and the family gets all their stuff back. This book has lots of funny details that made me laugh out loud. I thought this book was the 1st in the series so I decided to read it first...It turned out to be the 2nd but it still made sense. The only confusing part of the book was the prologue. It didn't quite make sense to me so I would say not to read it. It didn't have that much to do with anything important to me.I looked at the cover of the book and thought: This book would be SOOOO boring to read...BUT, when I actucally started reading, the book became my fave! I really enjoyed reading this book! And I would reccemend it."
3,Like Trying to Drink from a Fire Hose,"Not for the casual reader or those unfamiliar with historical-critical method, this collection of essays provides remarkable insight into the most recent work in Pauline exegesis. Unfortunately, like some of Professor Horsley's other texts, this book is sufficiently techinical so as to effectively limit itself to the academic community. Once again, Horsley has failed to reach the masses."
5,Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny: TV Movie 3,"If you loved watching the tv series then this will be for you. The tv movies otherwise known in Japan as the special editions have extra footage and alternate takes of how the characters experienced the situations depicted. In this volume the viewer is treated to how Shinn viewed the events and the results of his decisions. For Kira and Athrun fans, taking it from Shinn's vantage point equals less scenes of your favorites so keep that in mind. High and Mighty color provides the ending theme for this Volume this time, so please look forward to it."
4,short and to the point,great story line. I don't see to many similiarities between the original and this one.
1,Item do not respect the annoucement on the publicity,It was announcing the whole collectionand I received only one DVDI communicated and I will be reimbursed 100%still waiting for my reimbursement...
5,Wonderful for children's milestones or other events,"I have been using this journal since 2001. I wish I had found it sooner! Each night before bed I write a few lines about the day: I make a notation on the side for weather (temperatures, whether we had snow or rain) and I have found the four lines to be adequate for recording the basic events of each day. I have two young sons, ages 1 and 4, and I've been able to record their major milestones. Some events are too big or important for the four lines (Sept. 11, my second son's birth) and the publisher provides bonus pages in the back of the book with a convenient notation spot at each entry to write the page number you've used. If you are interested in lengthy journaling, this is not the book for you, but I really like it as a simple daily blotter. I think my kids will really appreciate the notes on the simple, mundane things (""Jake and Wes played Thomas the Tank Engine for hours today"") in the years to come."
