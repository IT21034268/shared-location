5,Inspirational Talent,"From the moment I heard their first big hit, I fell in love with these two guys. I was highly impressed that they wrote all their music and the lyrics are great. I seriously have listened to both their CD's over a million times.The mixture of slow paced melodical music and fast, bouncy beats make for an interesting CD. It's a hard to find CD...but well worth it."
2,eh,"I had to read this book for my college philosophy class, and for a book thats suppose to be made for beginners in philosophy, it was quite hard to read and understand. Philosophy isnt my strongest subject nor is it something Im interested in so focusing while reading was extremely hard."
5,Border Terriersilver pendant,"SOOOO cute and even more special since we have now received our 2 Border Terrier puppies, 9 weeks old. Thank you!!!"
4,Less Than the Sum of it's Parts,"Sadly, this book is proof that sometimes a thing is less than the sum of it's parts. The essays are drawn from presented papers, speeches, and in one case the foreword of another book. There is some redundancy in the articles as they weren't originally intended to be read one after another, so some of the text in selected articles sets up the same situation as another. There are some gems, the essay on the British invasion of Egypt being one, a subject usually ignored because it was after Napoleon had left. Also the essay concerning Wellington in Spain is very good as an overview.I would cautiously recommend this book to those who don't mind the extra content and are willing to put in the effort."
3,same old story,"The arbor was out by .012, bars not parallel, trunion washer were coned and not usable, but a pals system fixed all of this and the arbor is now within .001. no problems there now, thanks to all the great advice from othe reviews. definatly get the arbor aligned before putting on the extension tables and fence system. absolutly no problem w/ the belt, can't figure out what the glitch is there for others. Passed the nickel test and runs real quiet.Then there was the table top, the left wing is beveled on the wrong side (the back side), so now i have to decide between using amazon's great customer service or just taking it to a local machine shop. I think I wil opt for the latter.Shipping was fine except the fence was a little beat up and has some corrosion on it, nothing that can't be fixed."
2,Delta and Apex Did A Great Job - The Saw Did Not,"I did not like the Delta 36-717 and my guess is Delta is going to re-design this saw. I had a lot of problems with it, including shaking badly; however, my local dealer, Apex Saw of Reno, NV stood behind the product and took a return. In addition, Delta stood behind the saw and also told me they would give me a return.That is great customer service and I want to praise Apex Saw of Reno and Delta for their service.AD2"
2,Flakes off onto my face all day.,"I do like the way this looks on my brows: very natural looking. I will not purchase this again because as I apply it, it flakes off onto my makeup, and when I try to gently rub it off, it takes my makeup off, too. All day it flakes off. It is way too expensive to do this. I have written Damone, and he never replied to me."
3,cute,This book is the basic nursery rhyme. I bought it for the interesting way the pictures were made.
5,Best Slippers made,These are the only slippers that I wear ...they are very comfortable and last a long time. The material that is used is always top quality and well made.
5,so comfortable,"my Mother loved Daniel Green slippers so I decided to try them, now I know why they are so comfortable, cost more than flip flops but so worth it!!!!!"
5,great slipper,This is a great slipper. I've had these slippers in the past. You can't beat these slippers.
3,written,"slippers were too small. My daughter, Rebecca wetherly will be asking to exchange for a larger size. Thanks, D. Kidwell"
5,Dependable,My favorite slipper! I never order any other brand . The sizing is exact and they are top quality. The color selection is good.
2,Very poor quality,"it's not what it used to be, ...very poor quality, no leather insole, just the heal piece made of the leather. I returned them."
3,3rd time's a charm?,"would love to try wearing these slippers! On my 3rd order now for correct size, ordered .5 size bigger (8) too short, ordered 8.5 too short trying the 9 now ( and I wear a 7.5!) not giving up! Reviews are too good. /but keep this in mind when you are ordering. (narrow too so get the wide!)"
3,Not for wider feet,I normally wear a medium width but these slippers are very narrow. I assume they will stretch out a little if I am patient!
4,Great Slippers,"This was a gift for my Mom, boy was she surprised and happy, we searched and searched for these slippers and I was able to find them.What a perfect fit! Thank you for making my Mom soooooo Happy!"
2,Sole is slippery,Nice slipper but I'm concerned about slipping as the sole is very smooth. Also feel slipper is off about 1/2 size. Will try to break them in and any suggestions for the soles would be appreciated. Never spent this much on a slipper and am disappointed.
3,Nice slippers,"These slippers have nice support but run short & narrow. I usually wear a sz 9M, these I needed a 91/2W. I love them now."
1,daniel green glamour slipper,"I bought these slippers for my mother in law who has been wearing this brand of shoes for over 35yrs, and she couldnt get her foot into it they are so narrow, and I purchased a ww.....these shoes just are not made right"
2,Daniel Green Women's Glamous Slipper Not What they used to be!,"Daniel Green slippers, like everything else, are now made in China. They are no longer all leather inside and out. That is what made them so fabulous! I was so disappointed with the man made materials on the inside, and returned them."
2,poor fit/HORRIBLE return policy,"I ordered a 6.5W and it was still too narrow. I have ordered this slipper direct from Daniel Green and the regular 6.5 was narrow. But the wide was no different than my old pair that wasn't a wide. I tried to simply exchange it but was not allowed. They took returns only. When I tried to reorder, the discounted price had increased by $15. DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE FOLKS!!!"
5,AMAZING!!!,"This album is not only the GREATEST Def Leppard album of their career but likely one of the greatest albums of all time. i didn't even hear Pyromania until nearly 20 years after it's 1983 release and i wasn't even alive then but (in short) this record is timeless. With catchy radio hits like Photograph and Foolin' mixed with songs like Stagefright and Under Fire (which in my opinion totally should have been a single), this is the kind of cd that you can listen to without skipping a single song. i think the one, and only, thing that could have made Pyromania better is.....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. it is the ULTIMATE in Def Leppard and for that matter one of the ULTIMATES in music!"
3,Melodic energy.,"Pyromania is a better-than-good album that I've enjoyed listening to since I bought it a few years back. I don't think that it's better or worse than Hysteria (I find both albums to be on the same level). Of course Pyromania has a slightly harder edge to it than Hysteria. My favorite songs are ""Photograph"" and ""Billy's Got a Gun."" Those are both really good songs. There's also no doubt that most of the rest of the album is above average too. The only songs I would consider to be close to filler would be ""Comin' Under Fire"" and ""Action! Not Words."" ""Die Hard the Hunter"" is also an interesting song and has a futuristic edge to it. Pyromania isn't one of my favorites, but it's still got some above average material on it. I actually give it 3.5 stars."
5,My first Def Leppard album!,"1983's Pyromania was Def Leppard at the top. My favorite track is and always will be ""Foolin"". This is when they hit the big time. This album sold over 9 million copies and still is one of the biggest selling albums today. Next to ""High 'n' Dry"" this is a definitive classic!"
4,Great Disc,"I remember when this disc came out, wow has time flown by. It was great when it came out back then, and it still stands the test of time."
5,"Leppard Fans, It's just perfect for you..",I seen Def Leppard twice years ago when they come on the scene and what a show it was. The Pyromania (Deluxe Edition) was like going back in time to enjoy and bring back good memories from the past. If you're a Leppard fan this is a must have for your collection.
5,One of the best Def Leppard CD's ever,One of Def Leppard's best CD's of all time. Great quality sound and a great price. Can't go wrong with this CD. Every song is good.
5,"This is 80's metal, indeed...","And probably the best Def Leppard album ever put in the 80's scene. This album is full of catchy choruses, terrific guitar riffs with the underrated Steve Clark, and incredible voice by Joe Elliot. Def Leppard never put an album of this quality measures like this one."
5,Hair Metal Heaven,"Anybody worth their salt who experienced Pyromania during its initial run back in 1983 knows that this album is one of the tent poles of 80's music period! Finally remastered, and repackaged with live tracks, the definitive Def Leppard experience is available the way it should be. This album should be on anyone's short list who loves 80's music, heavy metal, hard rock, or British New Wave. It is melodic and driving at the same time. The production is fantastic. Vocals, guitar work, and percussion are all tight, and polished. This is everything a rock and roll experience should be."
5,A Working-Class Album By A Working-Class Band,"Def Leppard came from the tough streets of Sheffield, England and onto rock superstardom with this 1983 release. This is easily their best album and also their heaviest-rocking. The hits keep coming with songs like Photograph, Rock Of Ages, and Foolin'. Pete Willis was fired from the band during the making of this record and was replaced by Phil Collen, formerly of Girl. Alcohol was the demon that plagued Willis and cost him his job and would prove to be the demise of Steve Clark who died in 1991 of an overdose. This is balls-to-the-wall rock 'n' roll from start to finish. If you can't handle it, go listen to Michael Jackson."
5,brings back my youth everytime I here these songs.,this album was a big part of my youth I spent many a days listening to this album. I feel it still rules after 12 years I put it up with any album that can stand the test of time!!!
2,Worst lyrics ever!,"Def Leppard's songs had some of the most brainless lyrics ever composed. The music itself wasn't bad, but the brainless lyrics were so idiotic they rendered the music unlistenable. ""Rock Rock Till you Drop"" is a perfect example of the inane lyrics typical of most Def Leppard songs. In the chorus of that song, the band members all shout ""Rock rock till you drop"", and then they rhyme that with ""Rock rock never stop"". That could very well be one of the dumbest rhymes in the history of songwriting. Nothing could top that! I'm not saying that the band members were untalented, I kind of dig the music itself, but I detest the lyrics with a passion! They were so stupid!"
4,Remastered Classic,"This album kickstarted Def Leppard's commercial success in the US and rightfully so. ""Foolin'"" ""Rock of Ages"" and ""Photograph"" (an original MTV staple from the age) remain popular songs at Def Leppard concerts to this day. Having just seen Def Leppard in concert this past summer, it was especially interesting to hear the bonus tracks (a more or less complete concert from the Pyromania tour in 1983) and appreciate the comparison. The audio quality of the show is excellent, and the band is still young and lean. An excellent example of the genre and of the band itself."
3,Music Doesn't Get Much Better Than This,"I have had this album for a while now and I must say that it just keeps growing on me. It has quickly become one of those albums that I simply can't live without. Every song on this album is great. It amazes me every time I listen to this album how smoothly it flows. There isn't a vocal or instrumental that is out of place on Pyromania. Joe Elliot easily has one of the greateset voices ever in the history of Rock. The way Joe Elliot composed each of these songs is pure genius. In my opinion Def Leppard is one of the very few bands ever to create a perfect album and they were able to accomplish this feat twice. The first time of course was with Pyromania, and the second time was with Hysteria. As much as I Love AC/DC, I must say that Pyromania and Hysteria are better albums than Back In Black. If you are a fan of Rock Music then there isn't any reason why you shouldn't own this album. It far surpassed my expectations, so do yourself a favor and buy it too."
3,Early Def Leppard--And It Shows,"For diehard Def Leppard fans, ""Pyromania"" is essential listening, since it's part of their early rock stage, when their music was still somewhat unpolished, less popularized/mainstream (compared to later on), and full of earsplitting vocals akin to early Van Halen. And it's these exact reasons why I didn't really care for ""Pyromania."" I'm more of a casual Def Leppard fan, so it's no surprise I gave this CD a ""3,"" though I really liked two of the medium-tempoed ""ballads"" on here: ""Too Late For Love"" and ""Comin' Under Fire."" In fact, I like most of Def Leppard's older, slower songs compared to the others.So, in summary: If you're a longtime Def Leppard fan, then you should probably like ""Pyromania;"" but newer listeners who are more familiar with their recent pop albums should probably pass this CD up."
4,Worth it for the live disc,"The Deluxe Edition of Pyromania is LOUD. There is an improvement in the clarity of the cymbals, but overall I think the compression takes away from this album. The MFSL Gold disc remains the definitive version of this title.However, the live disc 2 sounds MUCH better than any previous bootlegs of this same show, and the Deluxe Edition of Pyromania is worth buying for the live disc alone."
1,Outdated advice,"Ms. Farrell doesn't get how markets now work. This book would have been great 20 years ago. Now it's just out of date.Two better books are Andrew Tobias's ""The Only Investment Guide You Will Ever Need"" and Peter Lynch's ""One Up On Wall Street."""
1,Deceptive advertising,"I thought I was buying a well-researched book by a woman I've seen on television for decades. Instead, all I got was an advertisement from her employer, PaineWebber. At least when Price Waterhouse publishes books (and they've published some good ones) they put their name right on the cover so you know what you're getting. I feel duped by Ms. Farrell."
1,Milking Women's Fears for Profit,"Taking a page out of Suze Orman's playbook, Ms. Farrell is trying to make a profit by scaring women about finances. Some women are smart enough (and confident enough) to avoid being taken in by this scare tactic but that doesn't stop people like Ms. Farrell from using fear to fatten her own bank account. Peter Lynch and Andrew Tobias have written far more helpful and less frightening books than Orman or Farrell."
2,Disappointing,"I expected more based on the press releases and after seeing her on television for so many decades.Not very insightful. Lacked new information. Merely repackaged old ideas with ""catchy"" phrases."
1,A Big Disappointment,"For years I have enjoyed Mary Farrell's comments on Wall Street Week. She comes across as a person of integrity and one who knows her stuff about stock picking.Unfortunately, Beyond the Basics is a real clunker! Too much of a promotion of Paine Webber, which makes me very suspect of everything said in the book. To bad Ms. Farrell doesn't have the same independence as John Bogel of the Vanguard Group.Those five star ratings must have come from fellow employees at Paine Webber who were given the book by their employer. To the rest of you, save your money."
5,Very Helpful Textbook,"Used this textbook for help with writing final paper on abortion. Was very helpful, easy to read, and provided a lot of insight on abortion and other controversial topics. Will keep and use again for future papers and reports."
5,Applying Ethics,Transaction was very quick and easy. Saved me a ton of money buying my book on amazon versus at the school book store.
1,Waste of time,"This movie reminded me of Cloverfield, shot all with a hand-held camera that often was never stationary for more that a second. The ""plot"" was boring and predictable and was a reworking of plots from a mix of other teenage comedies of the last few years. By the end of the movie you can't wait to be done with the movie to make the money you paid to rent it not a complete waste."
1,Book perpetuates cruel practice of unnecessary breeding.,"--this book attempts to TEACH important lessons about the value of life while VIOLATING those very same lessons when they pertain to live things other than people!--until we learn to share the planet w/ALL the creatures who live here, we are hurting ourselves most of all.--This book perpetuates the cruel practice of breeding domestic animals for no good reason."
3,Informative but wish Amazon listed as DVDR or as they call it AMAZON ON DEMAND!,"I have no issue with the content other than tab wouldve been nice. Comes on DVDR and, while professionally done as in not some crappy label sticker or scribble with a felt pen, @ $40 it wouldve been nice to be told upfront ya know? Still, such cool stuff i would buy it again and feel it more a fault of Amazon than Mr. Friedman."
4,Break through to the other side...,A great tool to improve your phrasing. If you improvise but always sound the same no matter what scale or mode you use this DVD will help.
1,DVD needs tabulature!!!!!!,"This DVD is impossible to follow without tabulature. It could take you an hour to figure out one riff. I was so annoyed that I emailed Marty Friedman. I told him, if you just add some tab it would be a great DVD. I asked him to send me some tab, NO REPLY yet. $43.50 with tax I can throw it in the garbage. What too much trouble to provide some tab for your customers."
5,Great Series,"This is a wonderful, heartwarming, sweet, and funny anime series, that I wish had more episodes. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is one of those series that you just never get tired of watching. I could easily watch this show over and over again."
4,This is what they should teach kids...,"Unlike lots of anime/manga out there now aday, where everything focus on romance, defying your parents, running away, monster chasing, so forth. Bamboo Blade has a never give-up message. The girls help each other to get through their personal ""hardships."" It's a cute and light-heart series."
5,A class of their own!!!,"With so many Beethoven quartet recordings in my library (over 20 complete sets and many individual quartet recordings), I was hesitant to order the three discs from Quatuor Mosaiques of the early string quartets. However, after reading all of the glowing reviews I decided to move forward and all I can say is WOW!!! I can honestly say that no other traversal I have heard of the op 18 quartets even begins to compare to these glorious recordings. They are, in a word, REVELATORY!You'll also want the other two discs for all the early quartets:Beethoven: String Quartets Opus 18 Nos. 2 & 3,Beethoven: String Quartets Opus 18 Nos. 5 & 6."
4,A very good record.,"I loved this album when I first got it, and while I don't play it much anymore, It's got some nice grooves to it."
4,Sting's Memorable Solo Debut,"""The Dream of the Blue Turtles"" (1985) was Sting's first solo recording after the demise of The Police. Collaborating with jazz artists such as Branford Marsalis, the singer-songwriter crafted an album of refreshing eclecticism and first-rate musicianship. The pretentious ""Russians"" is the only weak spot, but the remaining tracks are excellent - notably ""Shadows in the Rain"" and ""Children's Crusade."""
1,How to ruin a great CD,"I expected a lot from a remastered CD. This engineers version is terrible, or should I say treble. If remastered means add some reverb and boost the treble through the stratosphere then this is a work of art. After I leave here I'm ordering the original."
5,Quite an accomplishment,"Sting shot and was all net on this release. Scored big time. I think every song worked. And whether they are melody, or this or that, all these songs are great. They are jazzy. And the skill in the music is really more than just a good songwriter, such as Sting, but the execution by VERY skilled musicians.I really believe that the musicians (Sting included) on this recording could make debbie gibson/britney/etc sound stellar.BUT, to be fair, it takes a good song and sting never fails on this recording.A very enjoyable outing."
5,Wonderful marriage of poetry and music,"There are singers and there are writers and there are those who master both. Sting is not just a songwriter, he is a constantly evolving poet. To fathom Sting is to catch a glimpse of man's collective unconscious."
5,Jazzy rock,This is still one of the finest crossover CDs ever. The cool thing about Sting is how he crosses back and forth between genres on this CD. He is a talented guy who has surrounded himself with other fine musicians. The result is excellent.
4,All star Band,"This is a musician's Sting album. Actually, they all are, as Sting is quite a musician himself. This time, he surrounds himself with some world class jazz musicians, like Branford and Omar, and the results are occassionally stunning. Yes, there are some real classics on here, like set them free. However, the musical highlights come on tracks like Russians and shadows in the rain. Branford and Co. really cook on these tracks in a very modern, jazzy style. There is a bit of reverb on this album, which I think can take away from the live feel they were going for. As I say, all Sting albums are for musicians, but this one takes the cake over the rest. Adieu."
4,CLASSIC,"What can be said other than it is an original Sting production. I have always been a Police fan but never a fanatic. When Sting went solo, I started having an appreciation for his talent. This album (so many of his other albums) support my feelings. I have worn out a cassett and lost this cd many times only to purchase it again. It is a must for my collection."
5,Maybe his best!,"I loved The Police, but I must say Sting in his solo carreer is very, very good! This might be his best album. Maybe I would say ""Bring on the night"" is better, as it is a double cd with musics from this one. But anyway this one is a MUST for everyone!!!"
4,Twinnings Darjeeling Loose Black Tea,Tea is very good. Just have to work with it to get the taste you want. Will order when I need too.
2,Bad News - Bitter,"I usually love Darjeeling tea and Twinnings in general. I am not sure what the problem is with this latest batch, but it is very bitter. It almost to the point where I can't tolerate it. I don't understand it but this tea does look to be more cut and have more particles and ""dust"" than I remember."
1,"a very basic book , which does not offer enough useful info.",This book is for someone who wants to know a little about some of the basic things to look at on a boat. I did not find it to be a good value for the money and would not recommend it.
3,Basic book,"Quite ok if you just want to know the basics of Metal Boat Building. If, for example you want to buy a finished metal boat. If you really want to build a boat yourself, consider Tom Colvins Steel Boats (if i'm remembering the title right)."
3,Alt-Tab did not work,The keyboard seemed fine with one big problem: Alt-Tab did not work (to switch between Windows applications). I returned it to Amazon and bought a Lite-On for $6.99 from another vendor and it works perfectly.
3,didn't come with usb adaptor,If you are considering this for use with a laptop you will need a usb adapter.
3,Cheap; the little legs break easily,"Pros: Good typing feel. Nice pre-programmed buttons for volume, calculator, and MyComputer.Cons: Cheap build: the little legs in the back for tilting the keyboard break off right away. The home, end, insert, etc. keys are awkwardly placed.Definitely not worth more than about $10! But if you don't tilt your keyboard, you might not think it's bad at all."
2,"Flimsy , cheaply-made and not worth the money.","A cheaply-made, flimsy keyboard. This keyboard - although it is functional - is not worth the fifteen bucks. It's a 7 or 8 dollar keyboard that, because of its branding, is selling for double its worth. Microsoft hardware used to be consistently better than average.Not anymore."
5,Thank you,"Very professional business. The first item sent out is not that good, but after efficient communication, the seller delivered a good one. Pretty satisfied!!"
2,You get what you pay for,"I think it was just the keyboard that I received, but my spacebar would get stuck all the time. If I pressed the spacebar, the computer would register multiple spaces. I am pretty sure this is not a software/driver issue, I even downloaded the microsoft drivers and tried different keyboards, it only happens with this one.And overall, the construction and materials used is much inferior to the logitech that I'm using now. I used to be a fan of microsoft mice in the past and thought I'd give this a try, I don't think I will be buying another Microsoft peripheral again."
3,Nice keyboard for the price,"Spent a year or so with this keyboard now and its faults finally came up and annoyed me enough to get a new keyboard. The layout is nice and it's cheap and it works, but its price does show through in some aspects.For one, it has a pretty bad ""multiple keypress"" problem, where key presses stop registering if you're holding too many keys at once. This can be a problem in games when you're often holding down movement keys.Another is that some keys will start to ""stick"" over time and typing will begin to feel like it takes a lot more effort. The Ctrl and Delete keys in particular. It just becomes annoying to type with."
3,Ehhh.....Sorta good!,"This product is sorta ok. I thought the keyboard would be a bit bigger but when i got it, it was so small. But its worth your money's worth. Only people who haave big fingers must adjust to this keyboard though."
1,Very Disappointing,"While this booklet may be of help to hand knitters, there is very little in it for machine knitters except for a few text boxes at the end of the chapters. The sampler is not very decorative, so it isn't really a pattern for anything. I guess at $16 for a undersized booklet, I expected more. I am really disappointed when a book sells itself as something that it isn't."
5,Best Smelling Perfume,"Not flowery, kinda reminds me of Obsession by Calvin Klein. Very long lasting scent. You don't need to use a whole lot of it. Been wearing this for about 10 years or so. Used to be sold exclusively at Sears but now I can only find it on Amazon."
5,Looking to Make Life Sweeter,I placed my order on Friday and received it by Wedensday. I thought that was pretty quick. I love the smell. I tried Inner Realm first which was nice but I love the smell of Realm much better. This is my first time trying it too. It is very reasonably priced yet smells more expensive than it is. The best part is you only need a little. This will go a long way as the bottle was bigger than I expected. Thanks Amazon for making such a unique product available and affordable
1,Horrible!,"I bought this on a recommendation, and akkk what a mistake. This stuff smells awful!! I only used it once and got rid of it!"
3,Great Find,"My mom used to wear this perfume in the late 90's, early 2000's, and then it got discontinued. On a whim, I googled this perfume and found it-- where else-- here on Amazon! So I bought it, even though some of the reviews said that it didn't smell the same. My mom loved it and was super surprised that I managed to find it! She didn't think it smelled any different than she remembered."
4,Realm Cologne,"I bought this cologne in place of an old favorite of mine that is no longer made, Andron for Women by Jovan. It's been years since I've had it but have always wished they would come out with it again. I found Realm on Amazon one day and decided to give it a try. I would probably rate it a 3.5 if that were possible. It's pretty good but not great and is not nearly as good as Andron for Women was.That being said, it has a pleasant smell and I will definitely use it. It doesn't seem to last though. At least to me it seems that way. I put it on and like the smell but pretty soon can't smell it at all. I don't know if that's just me getting used to it and not noticing it anymore or not. It's very reasonably priced and is probably worth a try if you are interested in trying one of the pheromone type colognes. I bought it on Amazon and paid about $16 for it. A very fair price I think.I think I'll continue to look for some other brand still though and give it a try too."
3,Realm EDT for Women,"The fragrance is fine, and the price was OK, but with all of those pheromones, I was hoping to attract a man. So far, no takers!!!"
1,Not a tight fit,"These barndoor doesn't fit tight to the AC Slave Strobe, it keeps sliding out from the body where you mount the barndoor. I don't see it helps any at all on my studio, so I used an umbrella for my AC Slave Strobes and it works good. Beware on Adorama color filters for the strobes it might not fit. There are two sizes of strobes out in the market. I was lucky on my first 50 strobes but not on the second batch of 20 AC Strobes, it turn out to be the new replacement which are larger filter size and adorama color filters are too small to fit. Be sure you order the right Strobe for their color filters."
4,Delightful View of our Southwest Borderlands,In wonderful photos of our southern border between the United States and Mexico the author takes us on a 21st century alphabetic journey in bytes and bits represented by sticks and stones.......and she includes the arabic symbols all us kids know. We can find out about the photos in a paragraph description near the end of the tiny book. For the very curious she includes a bibligraphy and a website to explore further.This book is a clever and fun glimpse at southern Arizona.
4,Cadence Sensor,"I purchased this about 5 years ago with the Polar 625x wrist watch. The device did everything I asked of it and at the time I purchased it was great. I have now switched to Garmin Edge 500. I love it. I guess that should be part of another review.Thanks,"
1,Dont think it's real,I have bought Mens Hollywood for many years and I don't think this is the real stuff.Does not have the same strength as past purchases.Buyer beware from this seller!!
3,It was Ok,"I thought this version of Twelfth Night correctly portrayed the serious aspects of the play. It didn't put in the humor Shakespeare intended in some of the scenes, and I think that didn't make the play as interesting. The end was cleverly done and showed the surprise when all the secrets wre revealed."
2,Nothing New,"This is a great book for someone who is getting a new cat or has a cat but doesn't understand him/her.I was expecting some new information about a ""secret language"". There was no mention of the latest research in feline behavior and the author describes training a cat like training a dog; so what's the ""secret""?I agreed with almost everything in the book except the comment about cat owners who leave on a trip. The author says that cats do not get lonely. Well, that's wrong. He also says that a cat will go to the home where the best food is served. How does one explain cats who live with homeless street people?The title was deceiving."
5,Thank goodness for this book!,"My unruly cat was driving me absolutely crazy--scratching the furniture, swatting at my dog, and being generally ornery. She was driving me crazy! Well, with Dibra's tips and advice, I have trained her to stop wrecking my furniture, to get along with the dog, and behave in a pleasant, affectionate way. This book saved my cat's life--and made mine less of a hairball."
1,The author needs to check his facts,"I haven't finished the book, so I might revise my review later, but so far (about halfway through the book) I haven't learned anything new. In addition, I've found several bits of information that are either outdated or completely wrong. There is no bibliography in the book, which leads me to believe there was no research beyond the author's observations. In my opinion, a much better book on cat behavior is ""Think Like a Cat"" by Pam Johnson-Bennett"
2,Cat Clues,"Wasn't really impressed with this book. It's mostly common sense and can't really say I learned anything from this book, -sorry."
4,This CD kicks massive buttocks!,"Raimundos created a very exciting blend of Brazilian Northeastern rhythms (and lyrics full of witticisms and humor, which help the listener a lot to admire them) and their own hardcore influences. Their energy could be seen in a festival here in So Paulo (1994's Monsters of Rock billed alongside White Zombie, Slayer, Kiss etc), where they played a fully energetic concert. The vocalist just couldn't stop hopping on stage!"
4,Lots of fun,"Bought this for our family after seeing someone in the park with one and the kids had a blast. Little disappointed in the balloon quality, several had holes and never worked. A few popped on the first fill, other than that .... great fun. Just wished I ordered the refill pack with the initial order. Went thru all 30 balloons in 2 days!"
5,Grest Simple Toy,This is a present for children that gets a lot of use. It's also great for parties. We highly recommend them. You'll need the inflator as well.
5,A Blast!,"Got these as a present for my 3 1/2 year old boy. They are SO much fun!! My 5 year old girl loves them also. Heck, I love playing with as well!!! Most of them make a fabulously disgusting sound as they fly around when you let them go. Kids squeal as they fly, and are scared in a good way when one flies near them. An instant hit. We are buying a few of these to keep to give as presents for birthday parties our kids get invited to. Worth every penny. The hand pump that comes with them is a tad tricky to use properly each time, but you'll get the hang of it. So far, about a month of hard use, and the pump is still good to go. There seems to be about a 1 in 25 failure rate for the balloons. But when they do explode, the kids love it."
1,Balloons are not of good quality,"Balloons are not of good quality, out of 30 balloons, 5-6 didn't blow and 5-6 burst immediately after filling some air. so 1/3 of the total balloons are wasted. In overall I am not happy with the quality of balloons but my kids enjoyed with the rest of balloons."
1,absolutely worthless,"The pump will blow the balloons up fine, the balloons are long balloons. However the balloons do not go up, they go down and wiggle on the ground until the air goes out.As something to go up in the air even for say 5 feet, they are worthless. As something to blow up and let fly, they are worthless. Regular balloons at least will shoot aroundand not flop on the ground. Keep your money and buy a bottle of soap bubbles, they will fly longer and higher."
4,Funny toy,"You can't help but crack up at this toy. The sound is hilarious! I love simple, yet totally fun toys. We have a 5 year old and a 2 year old who thought this toy was exiting and hysterical. Who can argue with that. Plus it's inexpensive and durable. I like that the balloons are able to be re-used over and over again. And yet they give you so many. WIN! A+"
5,He is only good live,"Lets face it. Just about everybody likes one Neil Diamond song or another. We just hate to admit it. For any Diamond fan they also know that Diamond is only good live on stage and that his studio works are basically a piece of [junk]. This album is the one exception to all of his work. Recorded at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles in August of '72. Diamond comes out in a explosive start and ends with a triumphant finish. All of Diamonds other live recordings can't match this one. ""Hot August Night II, ""Gold"", ""Love at the Greek"", ""Live in America"", these can not even come close to the power of his performance this night at the greek. I would recomend getting this album most definately. The only bad thing about it is the B-side to the first Cd which has puke-enducing bad songs. Other than that it's great. So buy it now"
1,"Get Down, Neil!","If you only have to buy one Neil album, get this one...and put it in the trash compactor."
5,Forget the other live albums...this is IT,"My mom used to BLAST this album through the house and in the car. I didn't mind -- I liked it and still do. Even the somewhat hokey material like ""Soggy Pretzels"" has not lost its humorous charm. I only wish I had been there."
5,A Clever Movie,"I'm not usually a fan of Matthew McConaughey's (spelling?), but this has got to be one of his finest performances since A Time to Kill. This movie has a great blend of suspense, character arc, and story twists. McConaughey plays a lawyer who defends the unorthodox, and seemingly has no motivation except money. But when his client admits to being guilty, McConaughey finds himself in a moral dilemma. Highly recommended movie!"
4,Me likey,I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I wasn't initially expecting much but it delivered! I really liked Matthew's cool streetwise character. Lots of great reviews too
3,cool film,"watched this film the other night and was curious about it and it was real slick and polished and it had a old school matlock kinda sorta feel to it.not alot of surprises, but it was well paced and you kinda figured out a few things here and there. it tried to be old school and yet modern and it connected both worlds with a up dated twist. it was a well done film and it could have a life as a tv show."
4,Surprisingly Great!,"I don't usually like legal drama/thrillers, I find them very boring. But I really liked Matthew McConaughey is an actor I really like, so I checked it out, and I am really glad I did!***SPOILERS***There were so many twists and turns and surprises in this thing that I was constantly on my toes. The ending really surpised the heck outta me. The way the family tried to pin the murder of the main character's friend on him by using his own gun was awesome!Not to mention the surprise about how psycho the mother of the killer was really surprised me and I didn't see it coming!***END SPOILERS***You gotta check this one out!"
4,Interesting movie!,This did not go where I expected it to go.... overall good movie! Matthew McConaughey can act and this movie proves it.
3,One of McConaugheys Better films,"I was so strung out on Matthew McConaugheys romantic comedies that I almost didnt see this film for that simple fact. I got drawn in because of the lawyer aspect. A law and order lifetimer, i could always use a good courtroom drama. Overall a good film."
3,Ok movie,"Not a bad movie, but not one of my favorites; moved a little slow for me, although I did enjoy the ending!"
3,Decent Movie,"It's Matthew McConaughey, so you can't go wrong! It was a little predictable, but I still enjoyed the movie and would even watch it again."
4,"A flash lawyer, a psycho slasher and a courtroom. Not bad.","This thriller is a fine example of Hollywood's ability now and then to turn out a watchable movie with nothing to say and with no purpose, except to entertain us.It's hard to beat a clever, unscrupulous killer faced with a clever, often unscrupulous lawyer in a plot complex enough to make us admire the writer (Michael Connolly, who wrote the book). Add a trial where all will be discovered, truth will out, and the killer will be shown to have made a simple error that only the lawyer could prove... well, that's entertainment, folks.The Lincoln Lawyer (Mathew McConaughey plays the lawyer, who does a lot of business being driven around in a Lincoln) has violence, surprises, tension, a sheen of tawdriness, sex, a nice ex-wife, some fine character actors and a plot that keeps humming. McConaughey is fine as Mick Heller, a flash lawyer who winds up doing a good deed or two. Ryan Phillippe, as a spoiled rich boy, is just as good."
4,Good legal drama - kept me guessing,An enjoyable legal drama with a lot of twists. Good acting. Although I would say slightly unbelievable that Matthew McConaughey's character is such a genius while drinking quite so much. I imagine he could have solved this in half the time if he'd gone for a diet-coke every once in awhile instead of the Jack Daniels. Worth a watch.
2,Not a good movie,"I did not enjoy the movie at all. The plot was weak, it was slow to develop and I found myself watching my watch as much as the movie"
3,Not For Everyone,"I am not sure why, but I got the impression that only people in specific professions/fields (e.g. Law)would appreciate such a movie. It is too detailed and complicated that won't be appreciated by everyone. I tried to pay as much attention as possible to the story's details however still got lost and didn't get all of it.I know this is a good movie, however not for everyone."
1,matthew doesn't cut it,Matthew McConaughty is the wrong actor for the lead in this movie. Matt is too cute and too cool and does not fit the character from the book. Someone like a young Joseph Mantagnia (?)would have been perfect. He can act as well which is something Matt struggles with. It did help to have a strong cast just had the wrong Mickey.
1,bad,I have not received The Lincoln Lawyer yet and I ordered it the 15th of Sept. I have been billed for the item and have not seen it. If I had known that I would not have ordered anything that didnot come directly from Amazon.
3,"eh, it was ok","I wasn't totally disappointed, but I wasn't thrilled either. I thought this movie was kind of flat. There were a few bright spots of acting when Matthew McConaughey's character cries over not being able to recognize the innocent from the guilty or when he's figuring out he may have put an innocent man in jail, but other than that his acting was not so great. The highlights came from (in order) the guy who played the prostitute's ""john"" and the rehabbed ex-con who both took the stand in this courtroom/crime drama. Their performances had me in stitches -- they were really good. Ryan Phillipe wasn't too bad. He made a reasonably believable sociopath. The dialog was pretty thin... not the worst I've seen, but still. The plot was a bit choppy too... didn't seem to flow right (IMHO) - lol.Very average. I'm surprised so many gave this movie 4 or 5 stars. It was really just OK."
4,Great evening,Great movie to snuggle up on the sofa and enjoy a suspenseful well written movie. The actors do a great job in keeping you on the edge of your seat. Enjoy
5,WOW!!,What a performamce !! Matt plays the slick Lincoln Lawyer perfectly.Hope there is a Lincoln Lawyer 2 !!Don't miss this !!
5,Excellent flow,"The movie has no additives (things to beef it up) every part is important, from the opening scene to literally the last sentence."
5,good movie,"This movie was no where near as good as the book, I would suggest reading the book first to get a real feel for the plot."
4,good,The movie was good but it was predictable in most parts still it is a good movie to watch with your family
4,entertaining,Worth a couple of hours of your life....Wish ending were a little different...was waiting for more....but still good. I'd recommend.
4,Good thriller,The Lincoln Lawyer is a good thriller that keeps your attention from start to finish. I recommend this video for a good viewing.
3,Ouch.,"Either I missed something or this movie was out of its league/trying to hard/not worth the $14.99 rental. I'm betting, all of the above. Great cast? Yes. Interesting story? Yes. The story was disjointed, the legal account was less than accountable, and I'm no lawyer, and the wrap up went for something esoteric that totally missed the mark. All in all, not a waste of a night but would have waited for instant on Netflix knowing what I know now."
5,Lincoln Lawyer,Very good movie. My wife and I enjoyed it very much. She read the book a while back and thought that for the most part the movie followed the book well.
3,Light entertainment,"Lincoln Lawyer is a light, entertaining flick with a decent performance by cast. Five twist? Nah. Edge of your seat? Nah. In fact, if you don't have it figured out by the 30 minute mark, stay away from jigsaw puzzles of more than 10 pieces. But if you want to eat some popcorn and watch a movie, not hurt your brain in the slightest, not worry about a moral, or a point, or not think about a sequel - here you go. Have fun."
5,The Lincoln Lawyer,"I Loved this movie. It's one you can watch more than once and not get tired of..Matthew McConahey did a wonderful job as did the other actors, such as Trace Adkins...Not dissappointed at all with this purchase."
5,GREAT Movie!!,This is a great movie. It's probably the Best movie Matt M. has done since U571. The story line is great and it keeps you in suspense. The picture quality on Blu Ray is nothing short of perfect. The sound quality is also excellent. It's 7.1 surround sound. WOW!!!This is a must have for your collection.
5,Must watch...,"It's McConaughey. Great plot, and just when you think it's over....BAM...there's alot more to it. May start a little slow for you, but just give it time."
3,Entertaining,"Not very credible and not always easy to follow but reasonably well-acted. It held our interest and, afterwards, we felt satisfactorily entertained.Reminiscent of a toned-down Bourne film and/or ""Unknown"" without the extreme mayhem, intrigue and special effects. As in those films, you won't always understand what is said or follow what's going on or believe that much of what transpires is actually possible in real life. But, who cares? There's sufficient plot, tenseness and action to satisfy a casual viewer who is looking to sit back and be entertained."
2,kinda boring,"I guess a lot of people like this kind of thing, but I didn't pick up on anything original or that interesting. The acting was fine, as was the cinematography--some of the legal and courtroom stuff strained credulity for someone who sees a lot of the real thing--but it just failed to capture my interest."
4,Good Entertainment,"That was one good movie. I liked it a lot. But be awake. It's quick. Pay attention. Matthew McConaughey is a really good actor. I liked a lot of the characters, and the acting and story were well done."
5,A perfect vehicle for Matthew McConaughy's talents,"Great to see Matthew McMcConaughy in a role that is absolutely perfect for him, rather than in a more dull rom-com. Very suspenseful and pretty well written."
5,Another Great Performance,Another great performance by Matthew. Loved him as a lawyer in A Time to Kill and this film. He is perfect for this role and portrays the character well. Also an outstanding support cast and great story line.
4,Entertaining,"This was a very entertaining movie, not all of it believable but fathomable none the less. I found myself easily routing for the bad guy who was also the good guy. Definitely worth the time spent!"
4,Very nice...,"Good flick....good acting, and nice story with some excitement along the way, that keeps you guessing a lot through the film. I liked it. Still shows how slimy most lawyers are though."
3,GOOD NOT GREAT BUT GOOD,"This movie is worth seeing. I'm just glad I did not rush out and see it in the theater. I'm not the biggest fan of Matthew McConaughey but I must say, he was good in this movie and convincing in his role as a lawyer who was not seen as Mr. Justice, if you know what I mean. I just found the story rather weak. It could have been much better I think. I have not read the book but from the reviews of the movie I was just hoping for more. Something along the lines of The Rainmaker. Which I think had much better courtroom scenes. I know the stories are nothing a like but this movie did not hold up as well with court drama or story over all in my eyes. Still, if you are at home looking for something to watch and you have Amazon Prime go for it."
4,Perfectly cast,"I am not completely in love with this movie but it was a perfectly fine way to spend a couple of hours, and to my mind the casting was darn near perfect.This may be M. McConaughey's finest acting performance but he operates in a pretty narrow range. He is great at playing charming sleazeballs, and he plays this one to the hilt. Marisa Tomei is great at playing luminous but damaged women. Ryan Philippe is the best of the angel-faced manipulators. Nice to see Frances Fisher in a small but pivotal role - she is a great aristocratic beauty. And William H. Macy can play anything, so his part was a particular delight for me.The story moves along at a good pace. The milieu is meticulously crafted and feels very authentic. I think this is a really good summer movie."
5,Lincolin Lawyer Great Movie,"Best movie I have seen with Matthew McConaghey and Marisa Tomei makes youstop and think,There are really people out there that kill and injure peopleand think they can get away with it.. and I know that there are lawyers thatcan make the system work if push comes to shove.. Thought provoking movie ..Excellant cast and story line , I would see this again .. an enjoyable movie.you wont be sorry you watched it . Good pace from begining to end."
3,Good Movie but not great !,I watch this movie on dish other day I think it was a little to predictable in plots. I figured it out soon enough the hero was goinging to get even with the client for killing his buddy. The biker guys really gave him a beat down and there was several actors in movie that could have been deleted since they did not add any value. The Love interest Marsha Tomei role could have been bigger. Overall the movie was Ok and it is the kind of movie you can watch more the once. 3stars and I wanted to give it 4 stars but as stated the plots were like you seen it before.
4,Pretty good......,"This movie was pretty good considering there has been plenty of movies made of somewhat the same type storyline. This one however has enough twists and surprises to keep your serious attention, the acting was good the direction good story.good overall a solid 4 star film. I will always tell it like I see it.Scott M"
4,Great Entertainment,"I found this movie to be surprisingly entertaining. It wasn't particularly ""cookie-cutter"" as so many movies seem to be coming out of ""Holly-weird"" these days or a ""Reboot"" of a previously made movie. I also appreciate that they included the ""Southern Twins"" in this movie ""McConaughey and Lucas"" I'm pretty sure they are either Twins or Clones or Cousins!!! Just Sayin!!! ;)"
3,"Pleasant, yet unmemorable movie","The Lincoln Lawyer was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. Not your typical lawyer movie because more time was spent on how the main character conducted his business and less time in the courtroom. The acting was fine, the script was fine, and there were a few surprises. No Academy Awards for this movie. I would rent this movie before investing any money on a movie you may not desire to watch more than once. At the very least, buy the DVD instead of the Blu-ray because there is no reason for HD."
4,Excellent courtroom thriller,"Matthew McConaughey is a lawyer who likes to win and does not seem to care if his clients are guilty or not as long as they pay him his ridiculously high fees. The beginning of the movie is a little confusing as he is trying to handle few cases at a time.In the rest of the movie he is dealing with one of his clients, accused of killing a prostitude. His client claims to be innocent. I am not a lawyer and so I would not know if the movie was filled with holes as far as the technicalities of the courtroom goes, but other than that this movie is really good. There are number of surprises with a very satisfying ending.Definitely a very entertaining movie."
5,As good as the book...,"Saw this movie over the weekend. I must say I was a little afraid that it would be a let down after reading the book, so many times the book doesn't translate well into a movie. Not in this case, besides a few changes that were made, nothing major, the story/movie was spot on. Loved the twist at the end, and how every actor played their part to perfection. I can only hope that they bring back Mickey for a follow up movie sometime down the road. For the readers out there, give this series a try, you want be disappointed."
5,Easily the most enjoyable fiction movie I've seen in quite some time!,"I have all but completely stopped watching big studio fiction films, and primarily stick w. documentaries, however the previous high marks and general interest I had after watching the trailer made me roll the $3.99 dice, turns out that was gamble hit the paydirt for a change as this film is a gem in every respect. It's wonderfully written, directed, and acted...esp. Matthew McCougney who flat out delivered his best performance to date imho.So anyway, first review...perhaps the last one I ever do, but I believe when a product or service delivers far beyond a customer's expectations, than it's the customer's obligation to spread the good word when avail.5/5 stars all day long in my book...bravo Lionsgate, your know how to pick the winners and then deliver them better than any other studio, and Ive felt that way for a long time."
4,Great story,"I read the book. The screen does it very well. I just wish camera men would not spin around the room, distracting. This is a keeper. I did not know Matthew McConnaughey (sic) was worthy of a good role. Amazon always does so well for me."
4,"Gritty, Honest, Believable","This caught my eye because I remember reading the Connelly book upon which it was based--one of his best. The film does the author proud. In fact, it's even better! Not even 5 seconds are lost with Hollywood's annoying practice of slowing down so the viewer who already is into the action ""gets it""."
4,GOOD TO VERY GOOD,"Based on a novel by Michael Connelly, who incidentally seemed pleased with the adaption. A cynical yet very competent lawyer takes on the case of an ""innocent man"" and finds himself in for a number of surprises. Matthew McConaughey gives a stellar performance and is well suited for the role. His acting is truly one of the highlights for this film and a few of the dialogues sparkled. There's a good cast here, too, and while the elements of this thriller didn't floor me it was pretty good. The budget for this film was $40M and it yielded a bit over $85M at the Box Office. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B LEGAL THRILLER QUALITY: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid December 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus."
4,Mathew and Marisa a good combo,I thought the plot interesting and had a few unexpected turns. Although I did think it was a bit predictable....A good B movie night.
4,Good legal thriller,"A slick and well-paid defense attorney takes the case of a wealthy man who is accused of assaulting a prostitute. His guilt or innocence is seriously in question early on, and the case brings into doubt the guilt of one of his previous clients who is currently imprisoned. The lead character, Mickey Haller is not very likable, but the storyline is quite engrossing. There is no dead time in the film, with the entire movie focusing on the case at hand, keeping the viewer intrigued. The resolution of the case is not seriously in question, but the journey in getting there is worth the trip."
4,Good Flick,Enjoyable movie with a good story and plot. I would not recommend for any children under the age of 18.
4,Pretty Good!,"I recall wanting to see this film at the movies, and sort of missed it. However, I must say I am happy I did not decide to pass this one up all together. This is a pretty good movie, with an interesting twist in the end! I truly enjoyed it!"
4,very interesting plot,"I wasn't sure where this movie was going, and I like that in a movie. There was no way I could predict the ending."
3,Makes no sense...but well made!,"The basic plotline, of what the killer does to his lawyer,without giving details away, makes no sense!It's an extremely risky move to backstab your lawyer,and count on a great defense, with no counter-sabotage!Everything else about this film is great, top to bottom...but if you analyze the script, it's really too bigof a hole, and should have been altered.Edgy, fast-paced and fun...just don't analyze this one!"
5,engaging,The story and acting are well done; the movie took me by surprise. Excellent entertainment. Matthew M turns out to be much more of an actor than a romantic lead.
2,Poorly Directed/Edited Blandly Acted,"The story had potential but wasn't anything that, for the most part, hasn't been done before. Unfortunately it was so disjointed and poorly edited that it lacked continuity and flow. People and objects suddenly appear and disappear off camera with no reason. The flash backs seemed too flash-backy as if the director knew he had to fill some storyline holes. The rent-a-biker-group of stereotypic old codgers and the strange missing pistol prop and the off screen death of an investigator are a few examples of let's-just-stick'em into the story and see what happens mentality. The courtroom scenes also seemed very staged. The acting was too scripted and predictable as was the obvious things-aren't-what-they-seem plot twists. As far as writing it seemed as if the writer just tossed together bits and pieces of books and movies he had seen before and basically just rearranging the pieces."
4,Entertaining rendition of a good book,"I read the book and it was a very good legal thriller with smart twists. I thought they did a good job in the film, especially when you consider that it was a complex story. I thought McConaughey was perfectly cast as the cagey, street wise lawyer."
2,5 Stars???,"I read several reviews on this site before buying this movie, and I'm really starting to think I need to stop making that the basis for my movie purchasing decisions. Do other reviewers on here work for the movie studio that released this?(Spoiler alert)Let's not even waste our time with the plausibility of this movie... It's just dumb. The defense lawyer gets a conscience and wants to do the 'right thing' because he discovers his client really is a bad guy? I mean, duh... Defense lawyers defend those types of people...I don't really care about the premise of the film.. The bottom line is it was boring. The movie was about as well written as a crime drama you'd see on Fox. It was entertaining enough to sit through once, but I'll never watch it again and the ""surprise ending"" wasn't all that surprising.Rent this one..."
3,Average,"Not the worst movie we've seen. Not the best either....Not planning to watch this again, not good enough, very eh..."
3,"Good movie, bad video","This is a great movie. The plot, story and acting. Very different for Matthew McConaughey. However, the video I received is almost unwatchable. Half the screen is cut off. Not like wide view.I ended up renting the movie to see it. Didn't want the hastle of the return to Amazon. The cost wasn't over the top. But I was disappointed in the quality."
5,A great movie,"The movie kept me in suspense even though I read the book a couple of year ago.I went to see this movie to see if it was true to the book. It was somewhat different from the book, but very well done in its own way. I have read many books by the author and I love his thrillers. I am glad that the movie, although it did not match the book, it came close."
1,Fails to accomplish its sole purpose,"This is a completely useless item, unless you like buying shiny things that cost about $25 but have no other use beyond aesthetics. I wasted ten rounds being confused because the bore-sighter was completely off in the horizontal and vertical directions. Once I got sighted in I checked again and the dot was appearing barely within the field of view, as opposed to dead center left to right and perhaps a little low. Don't buy this."
4,"Gay or not, it's a great romance.","I was drawn to this movie because of the stars(Malcolm Gets, Chris Kattan, and Parker Posey) and I wasn't disappointed. This movie is very off beat and it works. The opening sequence is hysterical and a few of the ""running gags"" in the movie just make it better. Well worth watching."
4,Movie Arrival - Adam & Steve,"The DVD arrived. I haven't watched it yet. I can not believe this site. I wanted to note that this DVD had arrived at my home In Saint Louis, Missouri. Yet it requires more input on the DVD"
3,Cute...just cute.,"""Adam and Steve"" is the cinematic equivalent of a beach read. Entertaining throughout, a little off-color in spots but not terribly risqué. Amusing. Craig Chester really seems to be trying just a bit too hard here as director and star, and the humor is often strained, often sophomoric, and some of the gags just get overworked, but it's a bedroom farce so that's almost to be expected. The actors, to a person, are all engaging although, sadly, there's really little screen chemsitry between the principals, which is a shame because, taken individually, their performances, as I mentioned, are all engaging. It's good, however, to see gay actors playing gay roles for a change. It's not ""great art,"" and breaks no new ground, but it's a nice, easy fluff piece. I, persoanlly, would not add it to my own library because, for me, it doesn't merit more than one or two viewings. Rent this one first."
1,It thought it was supposed to be Funny?,"This Film was not funny, It bored me and it just really was a waste of time. Not worth getting unless you have trouble sleeping...then get this movie, it will put you to sleep faster than any sleeping pill."
3,Corny but funny and a must-see.,"Oh boy, this reeks of urban (New York / L.A.) blinders, but it is really a classic by now and should be seen by everyone. Some good laughs, even reminds me of Saturday Night Live skits and There's Something About Mary in some places. I'm glad I bought a copy and have watched it several times already."
3,Great Potential but Ends Up As a Mediocre Comedy.,"I had high hopes for this comedy. I love to give all independent gay films a chance, and I know some don't come close to the 'Hollywood' quality we all expect, but some really shine like 'Bear City'. This film had great potential but unfortunately went for cheap laughs and a disgusting gross-out factor at the beginning of the film which kind of spoiled the mood and high hopes I had for a lighthearted romantic comedy.The acting was just as mediocre as the cheap laughs, but at times I fully believed their characters.There were good moments, bad moments and some just so-so laughable moments. I for one would have preferred to RENT this instead of purchasing it."
2,Almost awful,"There was something quirky about this movie at first, even after the initial nightmarish beginning scene, but soon it faded to a cartoon version of itself, particularly Adam's family. What was that all about? It turned a mediocre film into a just plain bad film. There were a couple of giggles mixed with the groans, but I'd pass on this one."
4,lovely comedy,"Funny. Sometimes a little ackward. The leading actors are not ""the"" gorgeous type, but are charming and have good acting as well as the others. I think it worths owing it to see every now and then."
4,One of the few good ones...,"For storyline, direction, acting, music, you name it, this is one movie that's worth one's time and money - unlike many gay flicks today. Craig Chester is just simply 'good' at what he has done with this movie. More than anything else, however, I found the lack of anything gratuitous (sex, violence, drama, and just plain silliness) utterly refreshing. I've watched this movie several times already and it's one I will keep - unlike so many I've watched (barely) once and thrown in the trash..."
1,Awful,"I wanted this movie to be good, but boy was I disappointed. I've seen home movies with more acting, plot and feelings. Parker Posey should be embarrassed that she was in it. Save your money. The one guy is kind of hot so if you're looking for a butt shot, rent it and fast forward."
3,Not very interesting!,My 2-year daughter and 4-year son are fans of Bob the Builder. But they don't like this DVD too much.
3,one of the biggest bombs ever but it's not that bad...,"This one cost 100 million to make and made 2 million back , making it one of the biggest bombs ever. However it's not a truly terrilbe movie. It's a average space comedy that has a few laughs and is all in all entertaining. The dvd looks fine but a blu ray release would be better to see this one on your flatscreen. The sets are very impressive and costly so that makes up for any other failings perhaps!. I think the promo campaign for this one didn't help with slogans like 'pluto nash he's not from Uranus' around this only made people more than willing to flush this one down the toilet. Ok, if you like comedies that are so so funny , you may like this one; but the effects and sets make this one worth while watching and it deserves a blu ray release for that reason alone. I was actually one of the few people who saw this at the theater and it was actually impressive in some regards."
1,what was murphy thinking,this is a horrible movie. Ever since holy man Murphy has become a B grade actor. What a shame.
3,Not a bad film.,"I have been a fan of Eddie Murphy for ages. I won't say he can do no wrong, but it is rare indeed when he does. My kids love the Donkey from Shrek- thank heavens they haven't seen his ""blue"" side (""Raw"")I'm also a bigtime science fiction fan. So the idea of Murphy in outer space was an inspired one. He was kind of an even more wiseacre Han Solo in this one, and I liked that.Yeah, the script was a bit on the weak side, but Eddie's rapid-fire wit and the looney cavalcade of supporting players gave the proceedings an affable air of goofiness that was often infectious.I could have done without some of the toilet humor, though.While ""Pluto Nash"" may not be ""out of this world"", it is still a ""blast""."
1,"Less than a ""B"" movie","I like Eddie Murphy VERY MUCH, however this should have been kept on a shelf or released direct to video."
4,future cult classic!,"Went to see this at a matinee because there was nothing else to see. My brother and I were 2 of 3 in the entire theatre. This movie was so bad it's destined to be an MST classic. I pre-ordered the DVD for the bro for a gift, just to remind him of the two hours we lost that day....A'ight!"
3,It is a good standard movie,"they make it seem like it sucks, which is not the caseno, it is not any groundbreaking movie or something to change the cinema. But if you want to just watch a movie then you can watch this and won't waste your time. Eddie Murphy is great in whatever role he does. It's everyone else that can make a movie subpar. But for entertainment, sure, enjoyable."
3,ARE YOU CRAZY? THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD!!!,THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH WAS A FUNNY MOVIE. IT WORKS MAINLY AS AN ACTION MOVIE. THERE ARE PLENTY OF SHOOTOUTS AND FIGHTS. ROSARIO IS SEXY AS ALWAYS. PAM GRIER ONCE AGAIN GETS CHANCE TO KICK BUTT. SHE SHOULD'VE BEEN IN THE MOVIE MORE. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE GOOD. GIVE CREDIT WHEN CREDIT IS DUE. EDDIE MURPHY IS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN ACTOR TO HEADLINE A SCI-FI ACTION COMEDY. THE STUDIO WAS AT FAULT FOR NOT PROMOTING THE MOVIE PROPERLY. THE SCENE WHERE EDDIE AND ROSARIO HAVE THIER BODIES ALTERED IS THE FUNNIEST PART OF THE MOVIE. PAM GRIER IS ALSO INJECTS SOME FIRE INTO HER ROLE AS EDDIES MOTHER. WHEN JAY MOHR AND EDDIE ARE TOGETHER ONSCREEN THERE ARE PLENTY OF LAUGHS. THEY WORK GOOD TOGETHER. RANDY QUAID GETS A FEW LAUGHS AS AN OUTDATED ROBOT. OVERALL FANS OF EDDIE MURPHY WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. EDDIE SHOULD BE APPLAUDED FOR TRYING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WATCH THIS MOVIE AND MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND. YOU'LL LIKE IT.
4,"A fun time, not for grouchy critics","A hilarious movie full of charming characters. The only limitation is people who do not enjoy ""stupid"" humor will not like it, but the front cover of the box should clue people in.Pluto Nash (Murphy) is an ex-crook trying to make it in the honest world of running a night club, but gets into trouble with the moon mob when he refuses to sell out to a mysterious casino baron. With his robot side-kick Bruno (Randy Quaid, AKA ""cousin Eddie"" from the Vacation movies) a beautiful singer (Rosario Dawson), and his mother, Pluto Nash is chased across the moon colony by a bunch of goons while trying to find the bad guy that is behind it all.Lots of shooting, goofy robot interactions, freeze-dried Chihuahuas, and some good old Eddie Murphy wit make this a great movie for people who ""like this sort of thing."""
1,One of the worst movies ever,"One of the worst most unwatchable movies of all time. Right up there with I Dreamed of Africa, Battlefield Earth, Redneck Zombies, Fresh Horses and Zohan. I really hope the upcoming ""Dave"" movie is a whole lot better than this.I liked the name of the film; I guess that's why I'm giving it one star, that, and I had to."
3,The Movie is Kick!,"Granted the film is not state of the art sci-fi, it does have many funny scenes with a good story line and yes, some cornball stuff. It pokes fun at the hard core space films using robots and updating robots. It is a fun film not a film for serious film critics or hitech sci-fi fans. The film is clean of language and sex that is all too common in today's films and, the film does not really need them.If you are looking for a non-typical fun film to kick back and watch, Pluto Nash can be just good clean fun."
1,what is this???!!!,I remember the commercials and i remember still not liking it. and then the reviews said it was horrible maaannnn...i saw it and it was so horrible i just returned the movie the same day...actually i didn't see the movie....i just think this movie sux
4,nightclub on the moon,"The Adventures of Pluto Nash DVDThe Adventures of Pluto Nash stars Eddie Murphy as an ex-con who owns the most successful nightclub on the moon circa 2,087. He runs into trouble when he refuses to sell out to the Mob.If you like Eddie Murphy's brand of humor then you'll enjoy this movie. Recommended for fans of Eddie Murphy.Gunner April, 2008"
1,This movie SUCKS!,"I can't begin to describe the flaws for this film. The movie does a great job with the special effects and futuristic settings very well though. Everything else in this film, however, comes up short on all counts. Overall, this film is hardly worth noticing."
1,Makes the Fifth Element look like Citizen Kane.,Just a horrendous movie. A flop of the highest order..luckily for Rosario Dawson no one watched this monstrosity or she would have never landed another role.How Eddie Murphy ended up in this position boggles the mind. Once such an edgy and brilliant comedian and he is doing grade A Trash like this?Just awful on all levels.
2,Why the reissue?,"The disappointing new introduction to this influential American Studies classic largely restates the intended argument rather than seriously meditating upon, grappling with, and reassessing the works' legacy, methods, criticism, and subsequent developments in the field. The field's substantive critiques of his consensus theses are not addressed in any productive way. I would have liked to hear a justification for reissue: why now? Why this title?"
1,Below Average,"This merits about a one star when compared to concert dvd's from the likes of: Pat Benatar, Madonna, Shakira, Mariah Carey, Cher, Britney, Kylie & Christina. This dvd is not a keeper in my collection. For hard core fans only."
5,Fur immer,"This double dvd by Germany's rock goddess is the greatest thing I've seen in a long time.It's a must have for any Doro Pesch fan!!!!I only wish it featured old interviews with the warlock guys as well,but hey none the less this dvd is awsome!!!"
3,Entertaining,This book is as funny as I expected. I am surprised that most of her messages and advice still apply 50 years later.
4,Still relevant after all these years,"My first encounter with this work was a long time ago...when it was first published and I was just moving into young adulthood, recently married and unclear about what was ahead. From the advantage of hindsight, I see how good much of her advice is: have a network of friends of both (now all) genders, remembering that friendship does not necessarily involve ""sex""; get yourself prepared for independent economic success, so you have a real choice about partnerships; take care of yourself so you can provide responsible care for others. I found her advice frightening on first reading; now it confirms the realities of my life as it actually evolved."
2,Anti-Feminism,"Truly, 'Sex and the Single Girl' is a classic. Many consider it to be part of the 'second wave' of 20th Century womens' sufferage. I say that's 'pippy-poo' nonsense, to use the author's own adjetive.Helen Gurley Brown's book is largely about how to get a man (Be pretty, dress nice, be happy, etc.). She's the overly-plastic-surgeried founder of the magazine 'Cosmopolitan'. It's not bad advice, it's also not feminism. There's nothing about equality of the sexes in this book.Read it though. It's laugh out loud funny just for how dated and blind it is."
1,Stick With Candace Bushnell...,"Couldn't get through it. It was like reading one of those long e-mails friends send you when they're thinking out loud with total disregard to the fact that what they're saying has nothing to do with you and is not amusing; they should be writing in a journal instead. It was just boring. Not funny or relevant. I forced myself to read at least halfway through, thinking it'd get better, but it fell short. Nothing like ""Sex and the City."" Stick with Candace Bushnell! Trust me."
2,Not for the morally righteous!,"Sorry y'all, if you all thought this book was a 5 star rating. Unfortunately, I barely got past the first three chapters after putting the book down. Another two more years went by and I still haven't picked up the book. One day spring cleaning came, and I had to rid myself w/hoards of collected junk around my apartment.When I came across this book again, I jumped all the way to the last chapter, and then skimmed some pages. Finally, I decided to place the book in a very special place. The thrift store. Lol!No, I don't regret spending a hefty penny for this book. Although, I found the contents of the material quite intersting, I most certainly don't live by Brown's philosophy about being one of those high corporate, high maintenance, highly independent ""sex in the city"" girl. Althoug, I am currently and happily single."
5,"savvy woman, savvy advice","For someone like myself who has grown up with ""everything is relative, make your own way, be yourself etc etc"" you may be craving advice that doesn't just ""sit on the fence.""This book is like having a naughty aunt whisper in your ear the ""real facts"" of life, love, men, apartments, food. Some advice may be a little dated, but curiously, not as much as you think.My favourite quote, and there are many of them, is ""When you work for toads, drain the pond..."" I've repeated this to myselfmany times in my first serious job after university working for loser macho men - and that's in a supposedly more ""enlightened post-feminist"" 2004!I sincerely hope Helen is still living life to the fullest. It's a fun read."
4,Hooray!,"Wonderful! Helen Gurley Brown was a real trailblazer. Many people make fun of her, but she was one of the first women in the popular press to declare that women are sexual creatures, too--real human beings with desires, fears and ambitions. Thank you, Helen. You're not perfect and I don't always agree with you, but you were one of the most influential 20th-century feminists."
4,Good Book,"I read Sex and The Single Girl after I had saw the movie. I really enjoyed the book, I am not in the age range that book is for. I'm only 20, but I figured all single women are somewhat the same. I think it's a great read, and every woman no matter what age should read it. Just women need to keep in mind that the book was written years ago, and things and stores have changed. But other then that totally get it."
5,Elba Hits the Spot,"This CD has some of the best Nordeste Brasil style music I have ever heard. I never tire of listening to it. The songs ""Me Pegue Pra Chamegar"" and ""Paraiba Meu Amor"" are especially impressive. The sound quality is very high and for those intereted in pop art the photo of Elba on the back of the CD rivals that of Kate Bush on the back of the ""Lionheart"" LP jacket. I also like the variety of the songs she sings. The songs are very modern with a much better mix than on ""O Melhor de 2"" where the songs are repetitious. Although I like Elba's singing in ""O Grande Encontro"", expecially ""Sabia"", I think this studio recording is even better."
5,Beautiful Music,I came across this CD when I visited Brazil. This is beautiful music even if you don't understand the language. Elba is a sensational performer with a powerful voice. I have been listening to the CD continuously for two years and I am not tired of it yet.
3,No fue lo que pensaba,"En este libro Rodolfo Walsh se luce con narraciones muy ricas en descripciones y, al estilo Agatha Cristie, va desarrollando la trama de los cuentos con los mas intrincados razonamientos detectivescos.Es entretenido hasta un cierto punto pero para mi, en algunos casos llego al limite del tedio. No conozco mucho de la obra del autor y pense que me iba a encontrar con un libro del estilo de ""Operacion Masacre"" pero no fue asi."
5,Bullinger is my Mentor!,"Although he died in 1906, I have made Bullinger my mentor. I read all of his books over and over again so I can at least start where he left off in walk yoked with Jesus on the earth."
3,Its okay for holidays and events,It slides around a bit if you don;t have something under it to keep it in place. Works fine for events and also protects the table at other times.
3,Not as good as expected.,"Used once, washed, and hem is unraveling. It does repel liquids though. The square one I bought had a hem that was better constructed."
4,Bad Price,This IS a nice table cloth BUT you can buy the SAME on at FRED'S DISCOUNT STORE for like $3..........I actually got the light blue one!
5,Beautiful Touch to My Dining Area,I absolutely love this tablecloth! It is a nice gentle white color that goes very well with my dark wood dining set. It is very easy to clean because it repels liquids. I love this tablecloth so much that I want to get it in a few more colors to change it up for different seasons.
2,Weird color,"The tablecloth is of good quality, but the khaki does not look like khaki to me. It is a very weird color. I ordered a different color instead and and hope that will be better."
5,Head and shoulders above anything else,"There are a number of books on this subject; and I own a fair few of them. This particular item, has put an end to buying books on how to write. It is excellent. All of the others are by the ""how to"" writers. This, I believe is the only one; by a ""why"" writer.Why we do, and don't do things, pertaining to writing. The author taps the pulse that will enable you to write...if you follow her lead. And that is demonstrated, via the curious and excellent exercises listed.This book cannot be spoken of highly enough, for effectiveness and originality. You will also discover much about yourself and various motivations you possess.It puts a full length mirror up to the aspiring writer, and asks ""So you want to be a writer?...well if you do; you better get real"". Aaannnd...Dorothea doesn't go on and on and on.....!Clear, written well, brief and to the point.Best of the lot by a country mile!"
5,Best book yet for inspiring the writer,"I have purchased several books on writing fiction and non-fiction. And I would have to say, most of the books that I have purchased I did find useful in assisting me with what I wanted to know. But after reading Dorothea Brande's ""Becoming a Writer"", I felt the warmest type of inspiration. Brande came from the 30s era when she didn't have to contend with the computer, editors that only read two or three pages of a book before they throw it in the trash pile, or the pressures of a fast moving market. Yet, she knew full well what every writer experiences and needs to be told. And she told it, quite well, in this book. I loved it. I keep it next to my computer for reference from time to time. I recommend this wonderful book to anyone that has intentions of writing, no matter what area they are trying to enter. It is just great."
5,excellent :],very informative and has fun exercises! it's a must have if you want to find out if you can beocme a writer :]
1,Pedantic!,"Sorry, didn't like it! Outdated, and full of pedantic instructions, such as, you must set time aside to write, you must write, you must read, etc. Hey, my mother told me this stuff... Don't need Dorothea to feed me these tidbits. My mother's advice was more chock-full of inspiration and encouragement than the turn-of-the-century Ms. Brande who could not have imagined the times we now live in."
5,Useful for any creative pursuit,"This book is an excellent introduction to engaging your creative faculties. Ms. Brande's advice is timeless and consistent even with many of the current leaders in contemporary creative enterprises. While the content is focused on writing, I found the advice to be useful and easily adapted for any work which requires regular output and out-of-the-box thinking. ""Becoming a Writer"" addresses challenges in adjusting an individual's personality and habits to optimize creative output by providing simple, effective exercises and advice. This is a must read for anyone who desires to pursue a creative career...especially if that career is writing!"
3,Hodgepodge?,"I bought this book expecting some kind of feminist, empowering type of thing like ""When God Was a Woman"" by Merlin Stone. It is certainly not. This book is a hodgepodge of stream-of-consciousness poetry which is empowering in its own way, but really not what I was looking for. That is why the 3 stars, because I expected something else, not because it was poorly written or something."
1,Not The Stephen Hunter I know and Love,"If you enjoyed Dirty White Boys or any of the Sniper books, give this one a miss. Starts off fine but the action tales off and the story is disjointed and contrived.If you haven't read the others, get to it, a great author who has had a bad day."
1,Fuhgedaboudit,"They can't all be gems. This one wasn't. In fact, it was boring. See ""Spanish Gambit"" to prove to yourself that even Stephen Hunter can write two turkeys."
3,Weakest of Hunter's body of work.,"It's also one of his first novels, and at the time itmight've rated a little higher. However, he has far superiorofferings to acquire and digest before manically buying thisone to meet your Stephen Hunter fix.Oh, that was just me.Well, here's a nifty clue: not a sniper book.And another: not ""Dirty White Boys"" either."
3,No Work of Art,"This book fits in the category of ""highly improbable thriller with lots of action and little else"". Also, much is made of the fact that one of the main characters is Jewish. The vivid description of this person's lack of character and his cowardice leaves one wondering about Hunter's feelings generally about Jews. This is particularly so when his behavior is contrasted with virtually all of the other characters in the book. Overall, this book is mildly entertaining and has nothing else to offer."
3,Early Work,"The fact that most of the action, in this early work by Hunter, happens off stage is perhaps the most surprising thing about it. For an author, who is at the top of the action genre, this one is frustratingly restrained. But all of the elements he later masters are there- guns, assasins, heroes and villains, and haunted dreams of battles lost."
2,Contrived and Disjointed,"I couldn't wait for the end on this one. Unfortunately this was not because I was excited , but rather I only to move on to something else. The plot itself was extremely contrived and very disjointed. It offered no suspense whatsoever. On the positive side, character development was strong with Spreshnev's dialogue particularly chilling.I'll wait awhile to try another SH novel."
2,"""It ain't no dirty white boys""",Pretty far fetched and jumps too much. The reading has thought gaps and it is the kind of book that you can put down and pick up much later just to finish it.Hunter has done much better work.
2,Without Redeeming Qualities,"The good part: lots of action. The bad part: lacking entirely in substance or interesting characters, liberally sprinkled with mindless violence, highly improbable, basically without any significant redeeming qualities."
2,Only send me one illuminati group card,"I can't find the illumimati group card: ""church of the subgenius"".As a fresh customer, I don't know what to do. How can I contact with seller?"
1,The Lost War,"I was very disappointed with this comic. The art is very nice. However, the story is dribble. The writer assumes that you've seen the new movie and know the past characters.Not very well written or creative. Good for a collectors item though I guess."
5,Perfect,If they would only make a movie of the book - now that would be fantastic...the other two movies have their place and are fun but a movie that actually matched the book would be impressive and given the story line not hard to accomplish.
3,Darn expensive but useful,"This is one of the most expensive pieces of plastic ever. Second to only small pieces of my Honda. However, the kid loves the rocking motion. Recommended for kids 1-2 yrs. At that age, the jumping aspect is a bit hard, so the rocker makes it more accessible. See if you can get a used one so it's cheaper. It's one piece, so there is really no chance of this thing breaking."
5,Excellant addition to Roby horse,"This was purchased for a toddling 1 yr old and he loves to rock on the horse, the base makes it more sturdy for him. His 3 yr old sister loves her horse without the base. Highly recommend this for ""true"" toddlers who are not as sure on their feet to really rock with the Rody horse. My grandkids love these and it gives them great exercise in the house.Even their older cousins love to ride these and don't have to be told they are too big."
4,"Bigger than expected, good for bigger children","The base for the inflatable Rody horse was a bit bigger and bulkier than I had expected. Very light though and good if your child does in fact prefer to make Rody a rocking horse. My 2 year old nephew was a bit too small to sit steadily on the horse while it was in its base. He preferred to bounce on the rubber Rody instead. Once he gets bigger though, the rocking movement might work better with him. One warning - there are no footrests. I wouldn't say this base is essential, but if the child is big (3+) they may enjoy it."
4,As promised,"This was just as promised. It came when it was supposed to. The packaging was good, and it was as advertised."
4,pricey but used.,it's a little pricey but my son has used it a lot. i didn't think it gave much of a rock but after my son started developing more coordination and balance i realized it works pretty well. made out of sturdy plastic. it has some gripping things on the bottom to help it from sliding around on bare floors. it's also really easy to blow up the rody into the rocker base.
5,Lift Off Love,The performance of this vacuum is great! Getting the refurbed one has been no problem at all. It looks and performs just as great as the one my mom purchased brand new. What more can you ask for.
3,Good power but some flaws,"Refurb unit arrived fine, looked almost new.The unit itself works great on floors, however, the liftoff canister really doesn't do a very good job on the stairs with animal hair. You need to lift the unit with the brush on the stairs to really do a good job, and the unit was not meant to do that, so it is very cumbersome.My additional complaint is that the brush assembly and belt failed after about 4 to 6 months of regular (infrequent) use. It cost $30 to get replacement parts as they are not covered under warranty and considered regular wear and tear items. I've done further searching online and found many others with similar complaints. The brush assembly is made of plastic and seems to be prone to failure. I don't want to be spending $30 every 6 months to keep this vacuum going which is my biggest fear based on the other information I have found.Overall though it does do a wonderful job on regular floors and extremely easy to clean."
2,too many filters,"Bagless is great, but filter-less would be better. This model has 3 separate filters that have to be cleaned ALL THE TIME. When the filters are all perfectly clean, it works great. BUT, who wants to take out these dusty dirty filters and wash them all the time? And the canister that you empty the dirt out of is small, so you have to empty it frequently. I have a dog and a cat, and a two year old, so I am vacuuming a lot, and this was not the purchase I had hoped it would be."
3,Mising Parts,"The vacuum is fine. But it arrived poorly re-packed by Bissell.It was still dirty as if it was used or tested, and the screws needed for assembly were partially missing, there were only two of the four screws needed, rattling loosely inside. One of them was actually rattling around inside the vacuum motor compartment, which had to be disassembled to get to it! Thank goodness for the local hardware store, or else I would have had to ship this back! Low marks to Bissell for poor quality control and an annoying inconvenience, Amazon however, did their part with timely shipping, etc;."
2,poor longevity,"I thought the vacuum performed fine. It was nice not having to deal with bags, although the extra dust you are exposed to cleaning it would be a problem for anyone with dust allergies. The problem with mine was that it broke completely about 1.5 years after I bought it. Outside of warranty, and not worth the money to fix with many cheaper options available on the market now. It also didn't suck as well as some of the reviews claim, but I would say that it was powerful enough. Like most things in life, I guess you get what you pay for to a certain extent."
2,not so happy,the canister gets full so quickly.all the parts must be washed and then air dried.I might buy a Dyson next time.... it's just expensivethat's why i keep buying these cheaper vacuums.
1,Fire Hazard!,"I purchased my 3750r about 2 years ago. Yes, the price was ""good"" but now after a bit of time I now why. My wife and I noticed a burning smell coming from the vacuum cleaner. We stoped and tried to look for the problem. When we tried to remove the lift-off part we couldn't. The female and male connectors had melted together and burned the surrounding plastic. We called Bissell and they emediatley offered to send us a replacement ( Although, refurbished ) unit right away. It seems that they know of this problem and what the customers to keep quiet. All we have to do is to cut the power cable off of the old unit and send it to them ( they will provide us a FedEx label in 7-10 days ). Then the will send us another vacuum cleaner via FedEx at no charge! Well, better a refurbished one then having to spend about $150 for a new one. Buyer beware!"
5,Unbelieveable! Too good to be true!,"This is fantastic. I already had one of these vacuums which I paid retail to get. I wanted another for my son and went shopping online. I found this remanufactured one for half the retail price. I took a chance... and it paid off.Note: The same day I ordered this Bissell, I ordered a replacement part for a $500 Dyson that I own that is out of service. Now, 6 weeks later, Dyson has charged me, I have not received the part and Dyson customer service has not responded to two e-mails asking for information about my order.Conclusion: FORGET DYSON! Buy a reconditioned Bissell!"
3,It is okay,"I was sold on the fact that it is supposed to work well on stairs, but I had to order the attachement separately. I don't know where is the turbo brush, and shoulder strap?!"
3,Very HOT air coming out from the HEPA filter,Just got my yesterday and put it to work. I was amazed the dust it pick up that my old vacuum left behind.The only complain is I have VERY HOT air coming out from the HEPA filter. I can understand some hot air but it seem is very abnormal to have VERY HOT air with this unit. I am thinking about returning it for a replacement.Does any else has this problem or advise for me??
1,Great if it would work...,"I was really hesitant on purchasing a refurbished vacuum cause I always believed that your gonna get what you pay for. Well, took the chance and I'm back to my old thought process now. Got the vacuum last night (WOW, that was quick 4 days), and excitingly put it together this morning (finally, after 2 weeks clean carpets again), plugged it in and hmmmm, great motor sound, might clean better if the brush moved though. Called the Bissel Rep. and after 30 min (25 of taking personal information and 5 of troubleshooting)I got a big fat send it back it's ""defective"". Well, ya live and learn (or re-learn) eh."
2,not received,item not received so it is kinda hard to give it a different rating other than I don't like it
1,Don't do it!,"I was so tempted! And I did it! Don't do it! The quality of the fabric is not what you are hoping for! The hems rolls incessantly! I really like this company, have ordered from them for years, but this product really, really bit the dust!!! It didn't turn out AT ALL like pictured! Very sloppy product. The fabric is horrid. Talk about ""panties in a bunch....."""
4,"Nice, everyday summer panty.","I like the lightweight fabric used on these panties. Yes, the hems tend to roll but if I smooth them well during folding, that's minimized and not a bother. I will order them again as my sizes decrease.Not perfect but I do recommend them for hot weather wear."
4,"Excellent, But Read the Description Closely","I love these coveralls. However, be careful when purchasing this item, paying close attention to the description. The picture shows a hood, but the description does not include the hood. The coveralls came with no hood, as the description (not the picture) indicated."
5,Fall in love with Graham Colton Band,"I first heard Graham Colton Band at a Counting Crows concert this summer. And the second GCB started playing, I loved their music. Of course compared to seasoned music artists like Counting Crows, Graham Colton Band still has room to grow. They sound similar to Wallflowers, but a little less bluegrass. It's almost like Wallflowers meets Maroon 5. I will admit that the first time around their songs sound a bit similar. But let their cd run a few times in your player and you'll gradually pick up on these small nuances that'll make you love their sound. I think they are a nice change to all the one hit wonder pop stars that are on the radio now. Their songs have such meaning and the lyrics are truly very well written. If you love Counting Crows or the Wallflowers, I'm positive that you will also love Graham Colton Band."
3,"Graham Colton Band ""Drive""","""Don't Give Up On Me"" 4/5""Since You Broke It"" 5/5""First Week"" 4/5""Morning Light"" 4/5""Sending A Note"" 3/5""Cigarette"" 4/5""Killing Me"" 3/5""How Low"" 3/5""Cut"" 2/5""Don't Know What You Look"" 3/5""All The World Tonight"" 3/5The Graham Colton Band delivers good ol' rock a la Counting Crows or Guster. This stuff could definately be heard on any adult alternative station, and it should be. The album starts of great, but kind of wanders at the end. For the most part, however, the songs are teriffic.Overall rating: Three and a half stars."
4,Doesn't stand up. . .,"This album just doesn't stand up to their barely heard first release (self-titled). Listen to that one and compare it to this. I picked up an autographed copy YEARS ago when they opened for Guster in Pittsburgh. Their first CD is just spectacular. This one's not bad either, but just doesn't compare."
4,Not a bad concoction.,"Take one part Soul Asylum, add one part Toad the Wet Sprocket, sprinkle in a little Tom Petty and you get Graham Colton. A pleasant enough pop rock album by a band that can certainly play, and a group of songwriters who have a knack for hooking the listener. Great for riding around with the top down or simply enjoying with those closest to you."
5,Good music,"I gave this as a gift, and they loved it! Definitely a good purchase for James Brown fans! Worth the money."
3,what tha funk?,"not to say this not a funky cd. but it is not the original 1963 live at the apollo.look at the songs...HOT PANTS! geez 70's classic but not in '63 friends. get this right,cd now, im suprised you havent gotten a lot of flac already by the purists"
3,A Classic,"I bought the LP in 1963. Up to that point I had only heard his debut album, ""PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE"" and some singles I had purchased. The original LP was a mind blower, and none of the rereleases have matched the sound of the simple mono LP. The early and middle sixties were really, in my opinion, James' greatest days as a vocalist and a showman. The band was also terrific. The funk years found him demanding the groove, and finally, when his great voice began to fail, simply holding on.This CD is OK if you want a taste of the great JB, as a great R&B; performer. To those that are unaware, the ""extras"" are simply recorded edits from the album which were used to fill up 45 re-releases some years later."
5,Unbelievable,"This CD makes me wish I had been around in those days to see James Brown live.I bought this CD on recommendation from Amazon.com reviews after reading an article about the issuing of the album on CD a few years back. I was definitely not disappointed.The songs are great, the band is smokin', James Brown's vocals are perfect, and even the recording is great.One thing that is really neat is that you can hear a lot of musical things that showed up later in the decade (funk and Robert Plant's screaming vocals comes to mind).I will guarantee that if you buy this CD you will enjoy it - listen to it loud!"
1,!!! NOT 1962 ALBUM !!!,"!!! BEWARE, THIS MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU WANT-1962 CLASSIC IS ELSEWHERE !!!!! IF ITS NOT A LIVING BABY, THEN YOUR'E NOT PREGNANT !!"
2,A medley for a record.,"This is simply a medley of Greatest Hits (well, many were not hits, actually.) Not worth the investment, though it's a part of his history."
4,Christian perspective on dinosaurs w/o propoganda,"After over a year of seaching, I stumbled onto this book. It's the ONLY one I can find which presents accurate information about dinosaurs from a Christian perspective, without falling into young-earth creationist propoganda. Great pictures and up-to-date scientific data. Appropriate for grades 3 through 5 to read to themselves. Younger children will enjoy the pictures. It's not exactly a ""read-to-me"" book, however."
2,A bit unhappy.,"The belt I received had less friction to it and the wood slips a little bit when it goes through the sander. For the cost, I am disappointed, to say the least."
4,Conveyor Belt for Performax sander,"The product works well, but is in my opinion over priced for what it is. If I would have had time I would have shopped for an alternative source. I had read what a great ""upgrade"" it was supposed to be compared to the sandpaper belt that comes with the machine, however, I cannot detect any big difference in performance at all. If you try to sand a thin piece with too much pressure, it will still slip on the belt as it is feeding through and may need to have manual assistance to feed. The answer to that of course is to take smaller passes."
4,great product,great product but no instilation instructions my sander had a ceramic guide and the poly belt seems to work better with it removed but i had to guess at this a little simple instruction would have been nice shipping and service was fine thanks L.D.
1,Waste of money,"The belt seems to look like it will outlast the sandpaper type. Absolutely no information on installing the new belt big question use the guide blocks or not I left them off seems to track just fine. Now the big question how well does it work ? Not to good work pieces totally slip the surface is more like nylon than rubber (if your familiar with rubber roofing pretty much the same.) just way to slick. I'm hoping in time some of the slickness will wear down then it might grip. I think for $100 with shipping it's a waste of money. If you do a web search there is a place that sells the sandpaper feed belts for $25.40 . Don't know if I can post the web site this might help search ""Sanding Stinks but Our Sandpaper Rocks! """
4,Great pet food - whether or not you (or you pets) are vegan!,"this is a great pet food - both the cat and dog varieties. AND it contains only vegan ingredients - very hard to come by, and you know if you've been looking! my animals love the evolution diet pet foods - and actually gobble it up faster than their old pet food! it is a bit pricey, so unfortunately had to switch my dogs to a different vegan brand, though my cats still enjoy this food every day. my cats tend not to like it with water added, just as a tip."
1,"It ISN""T the Seiko's I have known","It gains 2 Min. in a day. I have tried it being worn, and Not being worn.A VERY Sad piece of ""metal"".I am 75 years old, and have worn Seiko watched for over 45 years.This is the WORSTEnough Said...."
4,"Classic, accurate, elegant","Seiko self-winding watches provide good accuracy without the need for batteries, and look great. My only reason for not giving the watch 5 stars is that this purchase was to replace an identical model that stopped after ten years' service. It was cheaper to buy a replacement than to pay a jeweler to fix the old one. Bad, in that a perfectly good watch can't be cost-effectively fixed, good, in that this replacement cost almost exactly the same today as its twin did ten years ago, and part of what makes it not a good candidate for cost-effective repair is that the new ones are so reasonably priced. I guess if I can get ten years' worth of service out of this nice looking watch too, I'll accept that."
1,"Using the term ""bad fanfic"" is being very kind!",This book is horrible. The writing is choppy. The plot is weak. any fan of Heidi will quickly find this book to be a big disappointment.I'd give this book zero stars if I could!
4,Very Pleased!,"I'm not sure what all of the fuss is about the clickwheel being too thick to operate on these things. I have no trouble using it at all. It almost makes it easier to use since it's less sensitive and keeps the selector from jumping around as much. Perhaps the less dexterious folks are the complainers. The slots for the hold and dock don't line up perfect, but, the 3 sides are made of neoprene and a little coaxing does the trick, no biggie. Love this case (and the price I was able to get it for)! Awesome! My only half way complaint is that it's not leather, but, oh well. Great for protecting my iPod!"
3,OBSESSED WITH GIRAFFES,I love giraffes. All giraffes. but what I received in the mail looked nothing like that cute plush giraffe in the picture that you see. Mine isn't even that cute... Major disappointment.
4,Birthday surprise !,My daughters video arrived right on her Bday !This Video is really cute and emphasizes friendship. There are alot of great surprises in the movie that keeps her watching it over and over again!
2,I'm too picky,This just didn't hit the target. Flavor was barely noticeable and the price too high for that shortcoming. I'll stick with Don Franciscos.
3,Okay,This coffee is just okay. The flavor is okay but not great and not very chocolate. I wont buy again and I wish I didnt now have 4 bags left to drink.
2,Ben Wa Balls,"I got what I paid for when it came to this pair of ben wa balls. I purchased them for $.99, they are made of cheap plastic, and there is a huge seam where each hemisphere of the balls is joined. This is definitely a novelty piece and should not actually be used to assist you with kegel exercises."
3,great for the price,i do like them but not in love they some time pinch and can be hard to clean. i do like the case they come in.
4,Works if Used,"I can only say that if these are used properly there can be great results, from my experience, have noticed the wife's orgasms is stronger and everything is find, wish they could of been slightly smaller and still have the strings attached. But worth the price if you will use them."
2,How do they work,"I bought these because I read that Kegel ball are a good exercise for tighten your wall; these balls have the weight but there were no instructions as to how to use them.I emailed the seller on instruction but never heard back. My dilemma is do you insert both balls or do you insert one ball and let the other hang, also do you continue doing your self Kegel exercise with the ball(s) inserted.I give it a 2 only because 'I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE THEM'"
4,Strongly recommended.,"I came to this book recently as an adult after first reading Tom's Midnight Garden as a boy many years ago and then re-reading it many times as an adult. I became an admirer of the way Philippa Pearce constructed that story and told it so well. I don't think Minnow on the Say is quite as good, but I think I had expectations which were too high. The book is beautifully written, the characterizations are good, slightly exaggerated in a Dickensian fashion, and the solution of the central riddle is well described. I would definitely recommend this book to any young person who enjoys good stories, and any adult who enjoys good children's literature."

So don't fear it, embrace it. ;)"
4,Excellent Comedy,"Saiko & Lavender is an incredibly amusing romp of an adventure. Yeah, I used the word ""romp."" So?Ahem... Anyway, the adventures of Lavender, magical potions expert and money-aficionado and her incredibly insane and super fast bunny-friend Saiko are just a mile-a-minute comedy ride. Not only do you have alien invasions, giant monster rampages, a trip to hell, and a whole lot of crazy pigmy elephants, you get it all with style, quality art, and excellent writing.If you enjoy odd-ball, off the wall humor with crazy antics and bizarre asides in the vein of FLCL and Excel Saga, this is an excellent book to pick up. Diana Sprinkle's art is fantastic, and the writing is great, with highly entertaining characters and a suitably bizarre plot."
3,Great Idea but WHY Webster Street GANG??,"Pretty good writing, great concept, but why designate a buch of elementary age kids as a ""gang,"" with all the horrid associations that brings? Especially in California, of all places! They are kids with the usual faults and prejudices of contemporary kids--but not what is normally associated with the term 'gang' these days, and I don't see that the author views them that way either. This, as much as the relatively obscure publisher, may account for the fact that this series has not really caught on with buyers."
5,great recording,"This CD is wonderful, both the quartets 4 and 6 are played with precision and verve. In addition the sound is very pleasant unlike many digital recording of string quartets where the violins sound like nails on a chalkboard. The Andante Cantabile and the Adagio sound sweet and full. Highly reccomended."
5,One of the funniest books you're likely to ever read.,"I've read and re-read this book at least a half-dozen times in the past 30 years. Parts still reduce me to helplessly uncontrolled laughter. Superb spoof of the James Bond type spy genre of the 1960s. As funny today as when new, like most of Sheckley's early material."
2,No - This Album Didn't Get Better With Age,"When Amazon recently offered this album as a $1.99 download deal, I figured that wasn't too much to lose to see if I had mistakenly rejected this album as drivel 30 years ago. I don't know - maybe after another 30 years I'll finally hear what those who really like this album are hearing. But for now, this album still seems mostly boring to me. I'm sure the music is technically brilliant, but I can't emotionally connect to most of it."
1,Not even worth $1.99!,"The Who was the most ""hit or miss"" group in rock history and this album is mostly misses! I forgot how corny and dated The Who's music is until I bought this turkey of an album. Aside from the title song, which I like, I rate these songs one or two stars."
4,Defining their identity,"This was the last Who album with Keith Moon and the band was in transition. Always in search of an identity, the band was caught in their glorious past yet still trying to blaze a trail of change musically. Townsend's swipe at disco (Sister Disco) validated his visionary tendencies on what direction the music was heading. He knew disco was a dead end and that if music in the rock genre was going to survive it would have to find a new path (The Music Must Change). Entwistle's look into the future (905) envisioned a brave new world. But in this world would the music survive? The Who leaves up to the listener to decide."
5,"Who are You, By the Who",Great songs that will be familiar and others that you might not have heard. Check out the cut called 905.
5,Anyone who thinks this album is less than stellar,"Is crocked! This is such an important Who album, it doesn't deserve any negative publicity. IMHO, this album is #2 behind Who's Next."
2,Who Are You?,Who are you to be messing with a classic Who recording? The boys at MCA have managed to destroy Who Are You by remixing the entire album. Gone is the subtle triple coda to Guitar and Pen as well certain important orchestral arrangements heard on the original release. The sound quality is not noticeably different either. The only good things are the addition of two bonus tracks and liner notes with pictures. The alternate versions included are not substantially different to warrant their inclusion. Tips: Find a used copy of the original CD release to experience this great album in its original glory.[DW]
3,Never Lend Your Guitar Or Your Pen,"WHO ARE YOU was the moment when Pete Townshend stalled out, and the rumble it sent through the Who proved, once and for all, who the driving force in the band really was.Two of the albums best tracks--""905"" and ""Trick Of The Light""--came from Entwistle. They are typically Entwistle, which is to say, they are totally atypical songs. One a clone's lament, the other about a man who doubts the sincerity of a hooker. Fun stuff.""Who Are You"" was the hit--I've never really understood why, the way it rambles all over the place--and ""Sister Disco"" was the fist-raiser on the subsequent US tour.But, as a writer and musician, I've always preferred ""Guitar & Pen,"" the only song I've ever heard that accurately describes the the highs and lows of the creative process. The second version added to the CD is even better, a much more in-yer-face mix."
3,R. I. P. Keith!,"The follow up to ""The Who By Numbers"" show's Peter Townshend trying to take the group towards a new direction where they wouldn't become a parody of their former selves. This works well on ""New Song"", ""Sister Disco"", and ""Music Must Change"" but John Entwistle's compositions here conflicts with Pete's and in the process creating a very uneven album. With Roger Daltrey singing almost all the songs, he becomes hectoring, trying to put his stamp on the material and find some common ground. Keith Moon, whose personal life was spinning out of control and close to being fired from the group, played probably his weakest set.Ironically, the title song is one of the best performances the Who ever gave.This reissue, remixed and remastered by Jon Astley, sounds superb. It also includeds the Who's version of ""Empty Glass"", one of Pete Townshend's most personal songs."
3,Keith's Last Stand,"This disk was released shortly before the passing of Keith Moon, who poses on the cover sitting in a chair labled ""Not to be taken away"". His best work long past him, Keith is noticably affected by the years of abuse. Daltrey seems to be trying very hard to hold things together, and does an admirable job vocally. John contribues ""905"" and ""Trick of the Light"" and does a good job vocally on the first one. ""Guitar and Pen"" and ""Love is Coming Down"" are decent Pete songs, and this disk includes additional songs and demos that were not available before. I recommend it for Who fans, but buy their earlier releases first."
4,The music must change,"This record was the Who trying to change and they admitted they we're growing out of style and older. ""My hairline ain't exactly superstar"" anyone? It stands up as a good record and sadly Keiths last, RIP"
5,Who they are,"This album came out right during post-punk and is quite simply spectacular. It does encompass most styles from Hard Rock (Trick of the light), electronic music (905) as well as much more complex compositions such as Guitar and Pen. Unfortnately it is the Who's last great album, but what an album. Even though Keith Moon would soon pass away he still is on great form throughout the album."
3,A very good album butchered by remix.,"I've had the vinyl version of this album for many years. I always loved the album with plenty of un-hailed gems that haven't been fully appreciated over the years.When this re-issued version came out naturally I had to have it.I'm not totally against remixing an album as long as the original elements are still there and it adds to the sound.Generally the remixes of the who catalogue have been good but not this time.What a disappointment. Apart from the extra tracks which are a welcome bonus, the remixing is a total hatchet job. There are different arrangements with bits missing (music must change guitar solo). It just doesn't sound the same. I actually don't think it even needed a re-mix. The original has always sounded fine to me.So, I got on to Amazon Canada and was able to pick up a brand new copy of the original mix which is the one that I play most."
4,Not to be taken away,"The Who / Who Are You (1996 four bonus tracks version): Not their best album, but has one of their best songs (Who Are You). There is too much filler here, but it's still an essential recording for the good stuff that IS in it. This is, of course, the last Who album that Keith Moon would be involved with before his unnecessary death (a case of `accidental suicide' - to borrow a phrase from John Mayall). However, getting back to the album, this is a good but not great album. It gets Four Stars."
3,"Decent Album, Curious Remixing","Add ""Guitar & Pen"" to the list of songs, which includes ""Who Are You,"" that appears in a different version from its original. Fans who've never heard the original LP of ""Who Are You"" may not care that ""G&P"" and ""Music Must Change"" are remixed differently, but some of us do, and my question is ""Why! "" It's tough enough to find the original ""naughty lyric"" version of the title cut in its entirety, and the ""box set"" has been rightly criticized for butchering and rearranging classic Who cuts.The songs are certainly below the par of ""Who's Next"" or ""Quadrophenia,"" but they hold together pretty well. Why Entwistle gets 3 cuts (none of which are that great) is a mystery, but it may indicate that Townshend was in the midst of a block and/or was holding back some goodies for his solo album. Too bad the boys didn't join together as a band and make this as listenable as it could've been. Consider it the Who's equivalent of Led Zeppelin's ""In Through the Out Door."""
1,REMIXED - DON'T BUY IT,"Nightmare for fans of the original LP. As has been stated in other reviews, about four or five songs have subtle but extremely disappointing re-mixes. Many of the little things that I had come to know by heart are suddenly gone and replaced.SACRILEGE! Why do record companies desecrate legendary pieces of work? For shame!By the way - I rate the original ""Who Are You"" very highly! It's in my top 20 of all-time favorite rock albums."
3,A Questionable Remaster,"Compared to 'Who's Next', this is a shockingly dull album. And since it was Moon's last, you'd expect fireworks, not to be unfortunately. With the exception of the title track, the rest is bland and sounds more like rough drafts than finished masters.The sound quality is the is the real surprise here: it sounds more like a vinyl lp rather than a top flight cd remaster. The high-end is muted and the dynamics don't have the punch they should like on 'Who's Next'. Very disappointing."
3,Acquired Taste,"This isn't the greatest Who album, as other reviewers have shared. The declining skills of Keith Moon and the increasing bitterness of Pete Townshend mar what could have otherwise been a powerful romp through the disco era. Daltry sounds as great as ever, and Entwhistle is steady as always, But Moon only shines on the title cut - which in my opinion is the only real Who song on the disc. Guitar and Pen i like, and Sister Disco is clever, but i hardly ever listen to the rest of the cuts.Had Keith not died after this release, the band probably would have broken up due to lack of interest in their own craft anymore. Knowing that this was Keith's last studio work makes this a must-have, and if you listen long enough you will grow to like some of the tracks. In a weird way Keith's death re-energized the group, and Face Dances is a much better offering because of it. Hard-core fans may be as disappointed as i am with this album but will buy it anyway. It's still the Who."
2,Two good songs.,"The two stars are for ""who are you"" and ""Twist of the light"" the rest of the album is not that great in my opinion."
3,Judged on its own,"Compared to the Who's best, this one is pretty low. Compared to their contemporaries' best, it's pretty low. But judged on its own, it's a pretty decent set of songs. I owned the lp back in the 80s and hadn't listened to it in years. Bought the disc about four years ago and thought it didn't stand up. But listening to it just this past week I enjoyed it. I especially like the lesser-known songs: ""Guitar and Pen"", ""Music Must Change"", ""Love is Coming Down"". And even after years of radio play, the title song still has lots of power and great playing. I think Pete really shines on this album in subtle ways.One disappointment: several of the songs have slight changes from the original LP. That is annoying."
3,A mixed effort,"Ultimately a mixed bag. There's three wonderful tracks (New Song, Music Must Change and the title track); two almost-great songs spoiled by over-production (Sister Disco, Love Is Coming Down); and one absolute travesty (Guitar And Pen). Entwistle's three songs chart his decline from charmingly black humorous songs to turgid heavy metal. The production by Glyn Johns (finished by Jon Astley) is cluttered and lifeless; the CD remastering improves matters somewhat, but it's still way below his usual standards. Ultimately these songs may have benefited from streamlining, stripping away the stacks of synths and more straightforward performance. What makes this album more than listenable are Daltrey's fantastic vocals (his best since Who's Next) and some of Townshend's most blistering guitar. Ironically, Pete's solo album Empty Glass would tackle this album's obsessions -- adolescent angst vs adult sophistication -- a lot more successfully."
3,"Four stars for the album, two for the remixing","This is not he best release by the original Who, but it's in the top five. However for the remaster, they remixed the disc, sometimes to really, REALLY tragic results. Removing the guitar overdub(s) on Trick of the Light removes so much of the sting of the album's strongest track. They did some tweaking to all of the catalogue during this remaster (I'm sure there will be another in the next few years) but I think this was the most ham-handed of the bunch. Pity."
3,Four Canadian Highwaymen,"I found this book very interesting. I opens a part of Canadian history which I believe is little known. It is only because I would have like more information, especially more background information to explain the origin of this sort of thing in Canada that I do not rate it at four stars."
2,Good tale,Good view depicting life when law.and order were not readily available and people suffered as a result at the hands of the robbers.
3,A Qualitative Treatment of Flight Mechanics,"This book is a good read on flight mechanics but is somewhat cursory in it's treatment of topics. The author's style makes for easy reading, albeit spelling and grammar is very British. The examples, graphs and what mathematics is presented in the book are in metric units. For the size of the book the author covers a broad range of subjects. He has a fluid style and an easy way of describing what can be a complex subject.The book, in my opinion, would not be appropriate as a college text on flight mechanics, but could be appropriate for some aviation technical courses. It is a good introductory text for pilots and homebuilders interested in gaining a qualitative grasp of the subject. For engineers, a more suitable text would be a book by the same title, ""Mechanics of Flight"", by Warren F. Phillips. This could easily be a companion text to that book or other more quantitative treatises on the subject."
5,"Short, but filled with information.",I have bought several books about Akita's from Amazon.This book was filled with information and was written in a easyto read format. I own seven Akita's and have raised two litters.Anyone thinking of purchasing an Akita for the first time shouldread this book.
3,Good Movies but left out most dramatic scene!,"I bought this exact copy from amazon because it was cheap. the movies in themselves are very good and not bad quality, but my one complaint is that (i had viewed the full movie of Penny Serenade previously.) left out one of the most dramatic scenes, it cuts off early when Cary Grant takes his adopted daughter before the judge to see if he will allow them to keep her seeing he has lost his job, it cuts off right before Cary Grant starts pleading with the man saying ""You cant take somebody's child away, Ill see she never does without,..... Ill beg Ill borrow, Ill starve, myself before Ill let her go!"" (not an EXACT quote because he says more than that but i am at a loss for words but it was to this pleading effect.) anyway my whole family agreed that one of the best scenes had been cut from this copy."
4,The Transformation of Intimacy,"The evidence, statistics and research that Giddens uses are useful and suited. Even though there are parts where it seems his analysis falls short and could pursue more depth, there are useful and interesting insights all along the book. It's analytic and pragmatic, objective and emotional. Balanced, as a result. Very good essay."
2,out-dated,This book is a very informative book based on traditional processes. It does not give you information to get you prepared for the 21 century organization. I guess it was good to know of the past.
3,"Good music, atrocious acting","Folks, FORGET about the horrible acting, corny dialougue, and stupid story, the MUSIC is the thing here. The obscure, unpolished R&B and Rockabilly acts are fun to watch and listen to. We see Southern R&B in the raw with the Five Stars, Preacher Smith and the Deacons (what a catchy name!), and perhaps the best known of this bunch, Roscoe Gordon with his ""Chicken time"" (complete with rooster on the piano). On the Rockabilly side, we have the Bluell Bros. (sorta like the Everly Bros. with choreography). The Cell Block 7, with a unique mix of dixieland and rock and roll (a clarinet in a rock and roll band!? No joke, folks). And yes, there's the Elvis/Gene Vincent clone Johnny Carroll, who makes up in energy what he lacks in originality. The great thing about this film is that it preserves Dallas rock and roll acts who would have otherwise lived only in the memories of those who were there. ""Wild Style"" goes rockabilly."
5,True Rockabilly + Cheese,"As far as music goes, ths movie Rocks.....many a cool Rockabilly riff can be heard in this flick....but the acting leaves alot to be desired. It was filmed in Texas in the 50's using ""local"" talent....so there are no real ""names"" in the film. The ""local"" talent, I am sure.....stayed that way, and NEVER went on to make another film......or at least we can hope. Although the storyline is weak at best......the music carries it through!! Rock Baby Rock It!!"
5,Hetria`~,I love this series so much and no words will express how excited I was when it arrived to complete the collection *until season 4*
2,Bleh,"Surprised when I noticed DVD was a bit damaged. There's a small, bit noticeable scratch on the first disk, but not complaining because it's still works :/"
3,5 minute episodes,"This is a series of 26 5-minute episodes. Having missed this I found it a bit disappointing, but have to admit the series was quite good overall. A lot of stereotyping (of every nation in the series), so some may find it offensive. Time constraints and multiple story lines may make it a little hard to follow at first. Realizing there are two main stories (WWII and ""Chibitalia"") and a couple of shorter ones thrown in will help in understanding the sudden changes in the beginning."
5,Great show.,"I absolutely love the humor in Hetalia. I was very excited to purchase this item. One thing, though, is that under the language in the Amazon info, it says it's only language is Japanese, and the subs are in English. I almost tried to cancel my purchase because of this, but thank God it was too late to cancel it, because it turned out to be that it was in English as well. I think someone should change that."
5,Season 2 of a Must Watch for Anime Fans,"So if you've seen season 1 of Hetalia: Axis Powers you probaly think it can't get any better, right? Well, it did! This show has only helped me in the classroom! Its so funny, it makes me want to learn about history! Learning history with Hetalia is as easy as poping in a dvd in to your dvd player! Then just sit back and enjoy the ride! This show makes me so much smarter I freaked! I just love this show I just can't seem to get enough of it! Love it! :) <3"
3,"This is not a funny film, at least not for me","Ego-centrical and clever young man makes everyone around him miserable, especially those closest to him, and earns his living by insulting his family and others.I am sorry, but that is my impression of this film.The acting is good.The transformation of Billy Crystal as he ages in the film is amazing.It is interesting to see how this ""model comedian"" develops.I truly believe that this film depicts some well known comedians who are really miserable and insulting people at heart.But when all is said and done, for me, this is NOT a funny film, and a very sad film for what the lead character does to those around him and closest to him."
1,"It deserved zero stars, actually. Terrible.","Read the negative Amazon comments - they are right. Terrible in all respects. I'm a big fan of BillyCrystal, but not of this film. I'd suggest renting it, if you feel that you must see it."
1,A Truly Horrid Movie,"I'm not normally one to complain about movies but thought I'd go out of my way to warn people of this terrible, terrible movie.It dragged on for (what seemed to be) forever, was not funny and was lacking any sort of direction.I'm normally a fan of Billy Crystal and usually find him funny and quite entertaining. In this movie however he was nothing short of irritating. Talk about a career killer.Seriously folks, save your money for something decent."
2,Directionless,"This movie had some interesting and funny material at the beginning, but quickly became unfunny, diirectionless, and seem to drag on like nothing else Crystal has ever created. When I initially saw the film in the theatre, as the movie dragged on, people were heading for the exits in droves, us included."
1,"Poor, poor film","Simply awful filmization about a comedian coming to terms with his own life. Embarrassing in all ways, with Crystal and rest of the cast wasted horrendously. To add to the ""turkey"" list, grade-Z makeup. Judge for yourself what is worse about this bomb: the dialouge, acting, or makeup."
5,Lovely book,My daughter loved this book and read from it every night to her children. She lost all of her children's books in a fire and this was the first one she wanted replaced. The ilustrations are beautiful.
2,Wide open mind needed,I am an animal lover. I was thus drawn to this book. It reads much like those Chicken Soup for the Soul Books. I found these animal stories full of nonsense. I love a good fantasy world and that is what these people are living in. Please don't try to convince me that a hamster fixing a lawn mower is reality oriented. This book is only for the most mystically gullible.
3,Sweet,"Lots of wonderful stories, but it's hard to read too many at one sitting. I wrote one of them so I have a personal investment in this book, and I do like it a lot. But although I chomp at the bit when scientists cry, ""Anthropomorphism"", I found myself crying the same thing more than once in the reading."
5,A book guaranteed to make you laugh and cry and love.,"OK, I'm a contributer to the book. So you might think I'd be biased. But this is one of the best feel-good experiences you will ever enjoy. Trust me, and read about the trust and communication we can all share with the little angels that share our lives. You will not regret the time spent and will return time and time again."
5,Wonderful,"I have never read a book that was so touching to my heart as Angel Animals. Having animals most of my life, I missed a lot of clues that they gave me. This book reminded me of the wonderful times I had with my dogs, cats, birds, etc. I have recommended this book to everyone I know."

1,Didnt even finish,"Loss of words on how to describe. Boring.. yes. Didnt even finish watching. Maybe a teenage or younger crowd may enjoy but as an adult, I found it lacking and definitely didnt keep my attention."
2,Warmed Over Spielberg for Kids,"J.J. Abrams, ""Super 8"" unabashedly draws on Spielberg films such as ""E.T"", ""Close Encounters of the the Third Kind"" and even a little of his version of the ""War of the Worlds."" The story is pretty contrived and the ending very predictable. It's obvious how it's going to turn out after about 45 minutes, especially with a bunch of kids leading the cast. Given that the film is presumed to be set in the late 70s, I'm pretty sure the use of ""totally"" as an affirmative had not yet entered teen-speak by that time, at least in Ohio. L.A., maybe -- Ohio, never."
3,LOST Goonies,"Super8 is an unabashed mix of some John Carpenter, 80s Spielberg and and the pilot of LOST. Now each of those things in its own right can be inspired, but somehow all of them together don't move past the feeling this is an extended episode of a cable TV show.I'm not going to point in too many directions to spoil the film, but J.J. Abrahms pulls the Shyamalan card too and tries to lead us with bread crumbs into something surprising. There are no surprises. The movie would have been better served sticking to the core of friends out to make a movie instead of going to the recycle bin. The friends making a movie part actually rings true from the heart, but it quickly goes down the chase movie route and the bulk is been there done that 30 years ago and then some.Is that to say the movie is not worth your time? Heck no. Super 8 is not surprising, nor original, but the movie is entertaining. Buy? Nope. Rent? Heck yeah."
3,so so,"this is what i call SO SO. it took very very long for the action to begin, like maybe one hour, there was action before but then return to the blah blah blah...anyway it was entertaining but SO SO"
2,"""AUTO-PILOTISH DIRECTION""","I knew I had to see this film when I saw the trailer. A trailer usually promises what can be deemed as a faithful description of the film. Watching Super 8 was like watching a 2 hour trailer of a film which never really begins, I kept waiting to be awed but the film lacks an intriguing storyline. I haven't read the book and don't intend to but I paid good money to watch this and came out feeling rather ripped off. I cannot fathom Spielberg made such a lousy film especially since he has BACK TO THE FUTURE to his credit. When I think science fiction, I think of films such as - District 9, War of the worlds, Jusassic Park and such. Definitely not Super 8. It's the kind of film you will never ever remember for anything, not even for the fat kid who thinks he should be a director. No irony and the direction seemed very auto-pilot'ish."
1,Can only be described as Amazingly.......,"AWFUL!!!!JJ Abrams needs to do better research if he wants to do Sci-Fi. The kid stops the alien from eating him by telling the creature, ""I understand"". What are you kidding?"
1,Sucks save your 3.99,"Save Your $3.99. There is a reason that there is a Facebook page called ""Super 8 Is The Worst Movie Ever. I rented this thinking it was a Steven King movie. Instead I got Stand By Me, Meets ET and District 9. Totally predictable and uninteresting."
1,So much potential!,"This movie had so much potential! There really could have been a real story, some depth. There is not climax to this film and there's really just a surface story. [SPOILERS] They mention when the alien touches you, you understand it. Yet they don't elaborate on this point. They're just like 'here it is, we're not going to do anything with it.' It could have been a great movie. I was so disappointed."
3,Worth Watching,"Great combo of danger, shoot 'em up, explosion and... heart. Perfect Abrams/Speilburg combo. The playback was rough toward the end."
2,Not at all what I was expecting,Guess I was expecting a real sci fi movie but this seemed more like a kids growing up dealing with issues type movie ... with a great train wreck scene thrown in.Bleh ...
2,Did We See The Same Movie,"Five of us, of various ages, watched this move together. We all had five thumbs down. After reading some of the glowing rewiews here on Amazon, I do wonder if they mean anything or are written by the production marketing detartment. This movie was quite lame; poorly written and the acting was uneven. We gave up counting the gaps in the plot, such as it was. Here we have a massive train wreck; yet the colonel walks right up and picks up the film wrapper.I could go on, but why . . ."
3,Alien versus kids,"I like it but they could leave out the swearing. It's bad enough when adults do. However, the girl did an excellent job of acting, especilally for the film they were making."
4,Super 8,"Super 8 is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie. Get your popcorn and soda before the movie starts because you won't want to miss a thing. It is an engaging and riveting story line, with lots of action, great special effects, thrills and chills. It's a fun movie to watch for families with older children. So, sit down, put your feet up, and enjoy!"
3,Fun but forgettable,"There are some amusing theatrics and enough going on to keep your eyes on the screen, but mostly this is a movie of pure cliche - misunderstood aliens, kids bravely defying their parents on matters of shallow emotional ""principals,"" tween romance, family reconciliation."
1,Horrible.,"The previews were great. Some kids in the 60-70's who make professional films witness a mysterious train crash. Awesome! Then what? Unexplained things start happening, government intervention, stupid adults, and kids save the day, the end. Oh and the main character communicates with the alien for a second or two. That's it. There was all sorts of build up that only lead to an absolute worthless ending. In fact, I don't even remember the exact ending it was so uneventful."
4,LOVE this movie,"I would've given it a 5/5 stars but the acting could have been a little stronger. The plot is real great though, it's not your typical movie. I LOVE JJ Abrams' Lost and Sci-Fi as a general genre of movies/books. Spielberg and Abrams do not disappoint. Great for ALL ages."
4,Child Actors Make The Film,"I thought this was a really good movie. The child actors far surpassed the adults' performances. I normally don't like watching alien movies, but this one had good characters and the alien was the backstory actually. It was more about Joe's loss of his mother and Alice's dad being involved in that somewhat. Also, Joe and Alice like each other.The special effects of the train crash were very good. I wanted to back away as in several scenes I felt as if the train was coming through the screen at me. The train derailment seemed to never end and I waited for someone to be killed in a horrible way as there were train cars and parts flying everywhere.One of the parts I liked best was when the credits were rolling, on the left side the movie the kids had made was playing. Too cute.I recommend this movie to people who like supernatural, alien and horror movies."
2,Pretty absurd,"Enjoyable, but the output of director who was a kid who did 8mm stuff when he was a teenager, and grew up to do the same thing with a trillion dollar budget. Speilberg found someone who has the same beginnings as he, but none of the story telling abilities. And the story is pretty silly.It has a lot of very gripping scenes, but, at the end, it's like you were taken on a thrill ride at the amusement park, and you have been on way too many of them over your lifespan to have this particular one have any impact."
2,uggggh!,didn't really like this one at all. it was boring and very unexciting to me and I fell asleep on it.
3,JJ Abrams is no Steven Spielberg,"Well, this movie was OK, there were lots of flaws to this one.First off, there is this new trend in movie-making to have this atrocious bigger-than-life sound to it and as a result the volume is either too loud or too low, this movie fails because of this flaw, the sound is just awful, noisy, busy, and tiresome.Next, the lighting was also just plain awful, very dark to the point of distraction, you will wind up just wanting it to be over already.Another annoying thing that Mr. Abrams tried, and failed at, was trying to create realistic dialog with the character talking over each other and lots busy stuff going on in every single tiresome scene and it just fails. I think that this is because the film had so little ground to cover in what seemed like a very long time...yawn...What was good about this movie were the kids, I mean, the movie that they made in the film, it was pretty good...My suggestion? Don't expect a Spielberg experience from this movie..."
4,A Loving Bow to a Master Film Maker,"I enjoyed watching this from start to finish: loved the train wreck, enjoyed the ode to past masters such as ""The Goonies"", ""ET""..it just has the feel of a Steven Spielberg but also the unpredictable edge that J.J. Abrams can bring. You aren't quite sure how far a scene may play out. My opinion was that this is great fun; sure it has a couple of unexplained issues, but perhaps they are supposed to be that way (boring if EVERYTHING is explained).Its a sci fi adventure film on a grand scale and definitely on my ""Must buy on Blu-Ray"" list :)"
5,Great film without a ton of crap thrown in,"So I'm not actually a small child, but for some reason I'm very sensitive to violence in movies. I can't count the number of times I've had to stop movies or leave the room because people get shot up or cut up or tortured or burned or whatever. I don't take it very well. This severely limits my entertainment options, since I appreciate a great story with well developed characters and an intriguing plot, I just cannot stomach lots of gore.I'm happy I watched Super 8 because it's an exciting and enjoyable movie where you can still feel suspense without being shown bodies as they're ripped apart. I love that. Also, the friendship is lovely between all the boys + Elle's character. Watch this movie for a good time. Not perfect, but a lovely escape."
4,Super,"I saw the film in a theater too. It was a lovely story, although there were some awful scenes. I think it will give lots of dreams to children and let them think about the importance of our world, the Earth. The ending was so nice. As I liked it so much, I even visited almost all the locations in Weirton after I had seen it in a theater. It is not a big problem, but there is one thing I don't know the reason. Why is this film sold with a bluray and dvd combo?"
4,A good Sci-Fi movie,"My family saw this movie at the theater and we just watched the DVD. We enjoyed it both times. My wife loves movies with child actors in it and said that this reminded her of ""Stand by Me."" I thought the kids did a good job of acting and the story line was pretty good. The special effects were also good and Spielberg always makes a great movie.It was creative and interesting to watch but I did not give it 5 starts because the alien wasn't really seen until the end and only for a short period of time. In the old movies they did this and kept the screen dark because the special effects were so bad. I always hated that! Today that is not necessary as special effects look so real and I think the movie would have been better with more scenes with the alien being shown.Overall it is a solid rank of 4 but it could have been a 5 with some script changes and more alien sightings."
4,Goonies with Aliens...,... only not as good as The Goonies. The cast of kids were all really cute and talented actors. The visuals were amazing. The plot kept me entertained. The only thing that got on my nerves was that the father's accent would come and go. I don't know why they tried to force him to drop what must be a prominent Southern accent. It would have made no difference to the movie and been much less distracting.
2,slowwwwww,"Most of the action was in the dark, which is usually meant to mask really bad special effects. I found myself bored fifteen minutes into the film, advancing it, with hopes of improvement, better acting, effects, something, but it never came. If you have really nothing better to do, don't watch this movie still, just sit and stare at the wall, it's brighter and more entertaining."
3,Good Movie,"I thought Dakota Fanning was to be in this movie. Maybe I am thinking of another movie. While it had a lot of action, it was kind of boring to me. I think teens or 24 year olds will like this, I didn't.Super 8"
2,Disappointing,"Why go w/ a bad guy mil. , this is not the 90's. Film could of at least tried for something original."
4,Fun but ...,"I liked super 8 but a few things jumped out at me..for one..in 79 we NEVER called each other 'dude' as these kids did..AND we didn't wear 'backpacks' EVER unless going camping..and then they were big bulky and or boy scout canvass type..AND the bikes were new style bmx variety..sorry..we only had 'banana bikes"" and or cruisers or 10 speeds. The BMX style may have been around but were not NOT common.I know Im picky,,i did like the alien tho! These kind of screwups irritate me for some reason. I mean if your spending wads of cash go to the correct prop room and get the right stuff for the era your trying to imitate."
3,Movie made for kids and then the rest...,"Good little monster movie. But instead of a monster movie with kids you get a kid'smovie with monsters. Good for a view or two, it keeps you interested to the end.As another reviewer stated...its 75% kids and 25% monster."
2,Falls terribly short,"I went into this movie thinking it was going to be similar to an E.T/Stand by Me type of 80s nostalgia film from the comments I've seen from others. After watching this movie I can say for sure that it is nowhere near the quality of those films. This movie is just so lackluster with the cliche, underdeveloped characters and the underwhelming big secret that is revealed that left me saying.. is this it? I'm glad i only paid $7.99 for this on blu ray because I'll never watch it again. I think I'll throw it off a bridge and film that, I'll probably get more entertainment out of it."
3,8 Was Enough for Me,"So - many people are giving Spiel & Co. the finger over Super 8. Here's my finger back at them, plus support for my gesture:1. Likable characters2. Decent plot3. Righteous FXBut the biggest reason I liked 8 was the sentimentality of it, something Spiel is a master of. He makes me remember being a kid and having dreams, biking around and thinking about nothing except the moment, wishing for the pretty girl to say hi, the posters and models - it just touched my heart. So thanks, Spiel and Abrams. You guys made me remember.It's a perfect summer film. Not taxing on the mind, just a slice of ""Ah, I used to be like that."""
2,once was enough,"This is the kind of movie I would only watch one time...and that's why I gave it 2 stars. The train crash was spectacular...but I think at least one kid should have died in the accident. The kids were entertaining...for the most part. This is an E.T. kind of movie. Good alien. Bad military. In the end, the alien gets away. This kind of movie has been done a few times before. Nothing new here. Just different actors and a different looking alien. The only redeeming value was when the 2 parents stopped fighting and started helping each other near the end of the movie."
3,light entertainment,"I must be getting too old to watch Steven Speilburg. Maybe he is no longer the filmmaker he once was. I enjoyed this movie, and I was rooting for it, but in the end it was just a light snack, not a great meal. The actors were very good, even the youngest ones, the filming was very skillful, but I didn't get caught up in the story like I did once upon a time, when Speilburg and I were in our prime. There wasn't any magic. I don't mean a story about magic, I mean the magic in the story that makes you believe that it is real, makes you one with the actors, makes you forget that you have a life waiting for you when the story ends.I began to tire at the first big scene, when the train accident happened. It was too fantastical, wildly unrealistic. The rest of the story felt contrived. I can recommend this for an evening's entertainment. I just can't get excited about it. And that leaves me a little bit sad."
3,E.T.'s Crystal Skull of the 3rd Kind,"It's Spielberg, therefore we can expect ...- Aliens (good. misunderstood)- Children (wise, funny)- Suspense (masterful, intriguing)- Military (bad, always bad)I liked the first 2/3 of the movie better than the last 1/3. A bit corny at the end, IMHO. Also, the CGI train crash was not very realistic -- too cartoonish!Spielberg purposely introduced a lot of blue glare lines and occasional spots & smudges on the lens (not the Super-8, but the big film cameras). I'm sure it was done as an after-effect to give the audience a sense of what filming was like during the Super-8 days, but frankly it was annoying! If it showed up only on the brief Super-8 footage, it would have made more sense, but not on the high definition quality cameras used for most of the movie. Enough with the blue lines across the screen already!! Perhaps this is explained in the special features, but I hadn't gotten to those yet."
3,Goonies Meets E.T at District 9.,"We have all seen this movie before and Goonies did it better. This movie was a yawner to me because I felt as if I had already seen it before many of times. The formula is just too familiar. What made it so funny while watching the movie in the theater for the first time, I imagined one of the kids calling one of the older characters ""Old Man"" blah blah blah. Well about 10 minutes later, one of the kids was referring to the older character as ""Old man"" blah blah blah. They have to stop making this movie."
4,"Interesting, but does not compare to the beloved ""E.T.""","""Super 8"" on Blu-ray was excellent, with a picture and sound 5 star. The story has an interesting screenplay, but suffers terribly in the end. With so much inherent power of the ""creature"" it is difficult to accept the mediocre end of this movie, since the E.T. decided at the last minute make a spaceship just using scrap with the power of your mind. The logical deduction is that the E.T. could have done it all before all the confusion he pitched throughout the movie, but then the movie would need a new and more intelligent screenplay, or a new story. The film holds our attention and is quite fun, except for the final very silly that is not worthy of producer Steven Spielberg and of director J.J. Abrams. So I give only 4 stars to the overall."
5,Nice,This movie is one of my family favorites. It has both blue ray and regular set which was pretty amazing
5,super 8,A nice movie and I also liked the extras that were added. It really was cute and interesting. Love the digital copy
3,SOMEWHAT GOOD BUT I EXPECTED MORE,"Set in the 70s and focused on a group of kids making a zombie movie who stumble upon something they weren't meant to know. The characters are nicely fleshed out and there's a definite sense of melancholy and even poignancy at times. In fact, I'd say the characters are the best part about this movie. The introduction of the alien and the ending resolution feels half baked, though. The end credits was done nicely. This film cost $50M to make and yielded close to $260M at the Box Office. A great deal of the advertising of this film early on was done through viral marketing.CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; RESONANCE: B; CGI: B; WHEN WATCHED: early December 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B"
2,ET on the cheap,Has a low budget feel. like ET but special effects are sub par for a Spielberg production. No surprises. Just ok.
3,Rude awakening!!!,"Expected alot more plot to it. The children actors were amazing for them to act like kids and not scripting it. Truly wasn't what I expected from the trailers and waiting for it to be released after the theaters. Only good acting, kept me from not ending the movie."
2,lame,they took ideas from 80's classics and tried to bring it to life but it had as much life as the zombie movie they were trying to make matter of fact the zombie movie was better Hollywood garbage wastee of money one word for this picture LAME
2,Don't get it.,"A dud!The ""monsters""...the whole movie... was too vague.Not worth buying, but okay for a rental if you're really bored."
2,just a warning,"I thought this was gonna be about the alien more then anything else. The alien actually took a back seat for most of the movie, while the rest of the movie goes into character development mode a little to indepth of that as far as I'm concerned. When a little alien action finally comes to play it seems a case of a to little to late to save the movie.It also didn't help that the story revolves mostly aroung young teens. I wanted a frigging alien movie not Monster Squad (which I would say is better then this).Renter at best, had I known what it was going to be like I'd never even bother renting it. (oh that's right I went ahead and saw it at the movies)."
3,Good Sci-Fi,"This is a good sci-fi movie, about some teenagers making a zombie movie when a huge train accident occurs and these little white cubes get thrown around everywhere. Next thing you know, the U.S. Air Force is grabbing up everything. Is there something they want to hide??? (Hint--could be!) ""Do not speak of this, or they will KILL you. . . and your parents!""A Stephen Spielberg production, filmed in West Virginia. Don't forget to watch the credits at the end for a little extra show."
2,"ok movie, but horrible sound mix.",I was unable to fully enjoy this film due to the insanely loud sound fx mix and low dialogue mix. I had to ride the remote volume the whole time.
2,another cheesey si-fi movie,Lame movie. Kids will probably like it though. Waste of money. Good thing it was a Red Box so i don't feel as ripped.
1,i felt raped watching this trash,"this pathetic excuse for a movie took my money, wasted my time, my energy.i can't believe Spielberg produced this utter ridiculous joke.if you are 5 years old, then go see the movie, if you have a brain at all and an adult, please stay away as this garbage will suck the life out of and drain you dry.really bad B movie is a good rating for this cheese wiz."
1,Super 8,"I tried to cancel my order before I watched it but I guess you can't do that. From the reviews that I read, I wasted money on a movie that I didn't see. Seems to be a good movie for children from what I read."
1,Stupid 8,"Is anyone else sick of Speilberg using that same shot of people peering up at the sky with wondrous looks on their faces. I mean he used it in Close Encounters, etcetera etcetera. And is anyone sick of his terrible plot. Watching his movies are like reading Stephen King. Lots of fluff and amazing pyrotechnics by no story, no plot. He just be banned from movie making. What was this movie about? A monster is trapped on earth, and waits to the movie to be made to build a spaceship? What? Stupid. Just plain stupid. And by the way, the little vignette of a Super 8 movie of the title made by the kid main characters and shown at the end with the credits was far better than the stupid movie which preceded it."
2,One of the worst movies,"I went to see this movie the first week it was out with high hopes. Being a huge fan of lost i was excited to see this since JJ Abrams produced it.The beginning of the movie is decent, but as soon as the stupid aliens show up it was ruined. The actors were below average. Why make a big name, big budget movie have little 10 years as the lead actors? I would have liked to see the dad have a bigger role(the guy in friday night lights). He was the biggest star of the movie and he was only in a few scenes. I went with my uncle to see this and hes a huge movie buff and he fell asleep it was so boring!This movie was like Battle:Los Angeles. Suppose to be a huge hit but fails in almost all areas."
3,Not as fresh as I hoped,"Young friends in the late 70's witness a huge train wreck while filming a movie. What they soon realize is that something escaped from the train during the accident and the military will do anything to cover it up.Super 8 starts out exciting, becomes very slow in the middle and then is exciting again. So I never found the pacing to be too good, while the film also reminded me of way too many Spielberg movies, including E.T, War of Worlds, Close Encounters and Goonies ""which he produced"" among others. While the thing in it ""and I won't give away what it is"", isn't very original looking.I will say that the film at least works emotionally and that all of the young actors are very strong in their roles. The look of the film is also faithful to Spielberg which works since the film is basically a tribute to him. But they might as well have gave away more of the plot in the trailers since the movie really isn't too original."
1,Horrible movie & way too dark,the movie was shot in such dark scenes that you could not see half of the movie. Most of the movie is soo unbelievable that its annoying. Don't bother. Heck I dont think I will watch any more movies from with JJ Abrams of Speilberg.
2,Extremely overrated,"Super 8 is a sub-par Spielberg knock-off. A forced-homage to the glory days of blockbuster film-making. I'm a fan of JJ Abrams first two films (Mission Impossible 3 and Star Trek)but this movie kind of left me cold. The story is boring and lacking any sort of emotional resonance. The design of the creature is uninspired, with unconvincing CGI, and not even remotely sympathetic. While all the kids are well-acted, their character's aren't really interesting, and many of them were downright annoying. The ending is silly, sentimental cheese at its worst. If you want to see the real thing, watch ET or Close Encounters instead."
2,WHICH AUDIENCE WAS THIS FILM MADE FOR?,"This film starts off as a kids film that makes it suitable for the pre-teens only. The mood changes and we then have a drunk and two junkies smoking illegal substances. For Spielberg,why did you have to have junkies in the film as it detracts from the film's intended audience? Definately not for pre-teens due to the substance abuse in the film (several times). The storyline is basically a rehash of the classic E.T. but without the emotional impact that E.T.had. You know the ending as it is very predictable all the way. In the finale you just yawn and say 'who cares' to yourself.Very disappointing."
1,Good movie for mental midgets and children,"This movie falls flat on its face trying to be the ""ET"" of today's generation. A predictable plot, tired character roles, and a boring take on ""other life"" are all throw into a blender and comes out a muddy, soupy mess in the end. There is no satisfaction to be had watching this film if you are over the age of 12. If you are 11 and younger - enjoy!"
2,Waste,"This movie was a complete waste of my time and money. I went to watch it in the theaters and when it ends you are like, ""really, that's all it was"". Complete waste of time. Don't watch."
2,Slow,"You will know what is going on long before this movie ""reveals"" it. I got bored and distracted 1/3 of the way through. I am very sorry I bought it. Rent this one if you have to, but don't expect too much. The acting is good, as are the effects, but it never, ever, astonished me. It was more like waiting around for it to finally end."
2,Watch other movies - not Super 8,I usually don't rate movie at Amazon. But this movie is just not good enough that I need to voice my opinion.I was expecting more from Steven Spielberg. The plot is too vague. How did the Air Force got the Alien? There is only one shot that you can see more clearly the face of the alien - but it was dark. The communication and inter action between the Alien and human are just not enough in this movie. The movie end quickly without explaining too much. Movie is about 1 hour and 45 minutes long.There are better movies out there - just not this one. I'm disappointed.I wathced the Blu-ray version and the picture sharpness and color are excellent in our 46 LCD TV.
3,E.T. Meets Cloverfield!!!,"This movie was a tiny bit better than I was expected. It's like a watered down Stephen King story. The monster/alien was pretty cool looking. It's big reveal was similar to that of Jaws, they didn't show it until the middle of the movie. In the early 80's, a few friends are making a zombie movie with a Super 8 mm camera. When a train derails, an alien breaks loose and creates havoc on the town. I'd probably recommend SUPER 8!!!"
2,what is the fuss all about?,"Every once in a while a movie comes along that everyone raves about. For me this was NOT one of those movies. The plot was formulaic and the entire movie had that been there done that feeling. Character development was terrible, plot holes glaring and just too derivative for my liking. I am fan of JJ Abrams, but this one was a total non-starter. The whole ET feel to the movie was just plain cheesy and there is just nothing original about this movie and thats why it gets 2 stars"
2,Thank Prime for another free movie that should be free,"Super 8 has good special effects and background music, and the kiddie actors put up decent performance -- but its ridiculous plot has four junior high schoolers saving the world! I mean, if the alien monster hadn't been impressed by Joe's moving spirituality at the end, he/she would probably have destroyed Ohio and the rest of the world, who knows? BTW, I love it when these alien breathe air and eat meat like you and me. How lovely. Yet they look so ugly, and why do they have to eat people for fun? Aside from the special effects, this is a hollow film devoid of anything meaningful."
3,Super8,Good special effects with a so-so story. Fair overall. It's not the usual quality you'd expect for a Spielberg production.
3,Not just for kids.,"This is a feel good movie. Truthfully I almost turned it off at the beginning, but 15 minutes in and I was into it. Brings you back to your childhood."
2,Goonies meets ET meets JeeperCreeper,"The first hour of the movie is incredibly boring.This movie had elements of ET and the Goonies...Why ET? because of the alien creature trying to return to his HOME. Why the Goonies? because of the kid bunch and the teen attraction between two characters.The entire movie is ""in the dark"". You cant see anything.(In-movie weirdness)When the town is overrun by the military: Every tank and military officers are shouting everywhere. The shooting makes no sense at all. Its like they were shooting ghosts.Speilberg should lay off the 80s already. Shirts, old tv sets, radios.... boring. If the target market is KIDS then they should lay off old electronics."
2,"Starts good, then gets really predictable","This movie started off good, it was really interesting and engaging for at least the first half or more! Then it started to show a very typical pattern of predictability and although the actors did a good job the story I lost interest with and I was not a fan of the ending. Some may like it, I watched because it had good reviews but I was not impressed and can now say I've seen it but will probably never watch it again."
2,OK movie to watch,"The performance by the actors is great; there are moments that are quite touching. But the story plot, ET type, is not clearly laid out, and sometimes quite inconsistent. I would say if you want to watch the movie for effects--OK, for story--not really."
3,Only good if you like Speilberg's work,"Very simple predictable plot, well acted but that's about it. If you like Spielberg's work you will probably enjoy this one. But I wish I hadn't wasted two hours on this one."
2,How did two great directors create such a lame movie?,I have to say I had high hopes for Super 8. Needless to say those hopes have been dashed. This was a flimsy excuse for a film which could have done with some more plot and character development and less of a cliche. The ending was lame and was so contrived a placard could have spelled it out. The thing that I really hated was that up until the last few minutes the movie was actually quite well done.The problem seems that no one could decide if the monster was good or bad and if should fear or hate it. It leaves us with so many unanswered questions and just wimps out. All in all this is a very poor movie and is not worth your time. I am glad I didn't waste my money when it was in the movies.
3,Typical Spielberg,Super 8 is mildly entertaining....but like most Spielberg flicks... there is a fair amount of cheese involved and it is rather predictable if you have seen his other movies.
3,"great acting & production, but still a patchwork quilt of cliched plot elements",This movie had great promise. Elle Fanning's performance almost balanced out the formulaic plot. If I'd had stopped watching at the halfway point I would have given it five stars. The second half deserves one. Average score is therefore three stars.
3,Ups and Downs,"All in all a little dissapointed in this movie. I read plenty of good reviews about it and I picked it up at a local store for 8 bucks. I felt the story line drug out too long then all of a sudden at the end when it started to get good it was over. there were a lot of good parts but also a lot of slow, boring parts.the video and audio on the blu ray were great especially the audio in the train wreck seen. if you have a good speaker setup with a sub it is awesome!for 8 bucks i'm not too upset i just expected a better flick..."
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Castaways, alien invasion, and paranormal phenomenon are nothing new, but when they are re-imagined by J.J. Abrams, they sure seem that way. Like king midis, everything Abrams touches is pure gold and Super 8 is no exception. On the surface, the film seems like something you've seen a million times before, but it's Abrams twist, turns, and imagination that make it very different. What I loved about this film, was that it's a blockbuster film, with two major names behind it, and there wasn't any big stars attached to it. In fact, most of the cast never had a major role in anything, like the lead, Joel Courtney. I don't know how they found this kid. He had zero professional experience and he was really fantastic. This movie is a gem, and while it seems like it's been done, you've never seen it done J.J. Abrams way. Super 8 is an evolved version of many similar films behind it and is one that they will talking about for years."
2,KIds' movie,"This movie is oriented toward kids, not adults, but there are a lot of scary scenes for young kids and I wouldn't really recommend it for kids under 13 either.The train-crash scene is grossly exaggerated and the alien-creature scenes are so ridiculously dark that you can hardly see anything. There are perhaps very few scenes with decent special effects, which still can't make the rather dragging plot any less boring."
4,E.T. with Jaws,"Super 8 is a throwback of sorts to the storytelling that made 80's films like E.T. so compelling. Only this time around there is an added dose of menace. The trailers didn't give too much away, which made the movie seem mysterious and boring at the same time, when it's far from the latter. Basically, a train crashes while a group of kids are filming a zombie movie. Something breaks out of the train and strange things start to happen in the neighboring small town. All of the dogs run away and people go missing. I'm not going to spoil the surprises, since it was a much better experience for me not knowing. The CGI is very good and the all the kid actors are convincing.J.J. Abrams may have stolen a lot of Spielberg's charms here, but it is rare thing these days to watch a summer film that relies on it's story, acting and nostalgia, rather than just loud explosions and CGI overkill."
2,"In a word, overrated!","There was plenty of buzz surrounding this movie, I was expecting alot after hitting the play button on my dvd player. What a huge dissapointment this one was. Super 8 left me with a been there done that feeling. It really is a hodge podge of other better movies. Another thing that bothered me was that super 8 Couldnt make up its mind of what audience it was geared towards, The kids in the movie swear like sailors and there are a few monster killings. On the other hand there is cheesy kid friendly sappiness sprinkled throughout,(espeacialy toward the end). Actually I would have rather seen a whole movie about kids in the 70s making a super 8 film with interesting character development and witty dialogue! scrap all the monster stuff."
5,Never a dull moment,"This was Spielberg at this best. This was a very fast paced mysterious plot that left you on the edge of your seat.Best of all though were the portrayals by the young actors, and the way they interact with each other to keep the plot moving. It has a lot of shock and surprises, and be sure to watch the trailer at the end. Super 8 is destined to become another Spielberg classic."
4,old school epic,I really enjoyed this movie. If kinda reminded me of the type of films we grew up on in the 80's. only thing I didn't like was the sometimes distracting blue streaks that the film maker is know for. He went a little over board. Other than that it was good and worth your time.
4,Enjoyed it,"I agree that the film is not a spectacular vehicle. However, I did actually enjoy it quite a bit. It is a great kids/teenagers program, but I still enjoyed watching the kids and remembering 'back in the day'. The child actors were excellent. Nothing new and exciting, per se, but still quite an enjoyable way to spend a cold Sunday afternoon with a quilt and a cup of tea. Not an 'owner' but worth the 'sale' rental through Amazon."
3,Better Than Average,"Engaging when focusing on the kids and their growth and understanding with the complexities of the adult world. Less so when it was an action movie (most of the last half).Not just nostalgic for a way of life, but for a kind of filmmaking, one that put story over spectacle. Which is ironic, since it's the spectacle that prevents Super 8 from being a classic."
2,What is it with Steven Spielberg's Obsession with Foul-Mouthed Children?,"This could have been a very entertaining family movie, but Steven Spielberg ruined it for me once again, just as he did with E.T. many years go, with his obsession with foul-mouthed-children characters (remember, in E.T., the insult ""Penis breath!"" shouted by a young boy in an otherwise family-friendly movie?). I know many will probably disagree, so flame away, but that's how Super 8 struck me. Every time the boy in charge of making the Super 8 movie opens his mouth, some variety of swearing comes out. Enough already!"
1,DIGITAL COPY IS ALREADY REDEEMED AND EXPIRED,The Blu-Ray itself is fine. I am looking to get my digital copy though! The one sent with the Blu-Ray is already redeemed and expired.
2,Good but not that good,"it was a decent movie, part goonies, part ET but those movies are classics and this one is not. i watched the whole thing but i am sure glad i didn't waste any money on it."
2,"It's NOT ""The Goonies""","The ""Goonies"", ""Stand By Me's"", and ""ET's"" of my day were way better. Super 8 tries to be a coming of age story, but falls way short. Like so many movies today, instead of developing the characters and focusing on a good storyline the film relies heavily on special effects. In doing so the film loses its heart. We have plenty of Transformer type movies, it would have been nice to see this movie differentiate itself. Also, what happened to the professor in the end....?"
2,Not Really for Adults and Not Really for Young Children,"Special effects is all this movie has to offer. The story line has been told many many times before in different settings. Poor character development, predictable story line and relying on the special effects to create the excitement made this a very boring movie."
2,Kid friendly cursing-not so much,"This movie would have been so much better without the cursing. J. J. Abrams has children. Does he really think middle school kids curse this much. I watched this film with my 12 and 13 year olds and they were disturbed by the language. I did not appreciate it either. Did Abrams think it was funny to have so much of it? What was the point? Maybe the people in charge are used to adult situations and can't put themselves in a kids shoes. If you are a parent and you don't like your kids to hear a ton of language(especially from other children) in a ""family friendly movie"", then do not watch this one."
2,Cannot Hear anything,"Every time I try to watch someting on Amazon on my computer the volume is way too soft to hear anything,can this be fixed?"
2,Disappointing,"""Super 8"" is essentially ""ET"" on steroids, but while it's produced by Steven Spielberg it lacks the emotional force of a Spielberg movie. The characters aren't really likeable or credible, making their many attempts at creating emotion uncomfortable to watch. Despite Abrams' reputation for spinning a good yarn, there isn't much of a story here. All in all, this is a very bad ET re-make, and everyone would be better off re-watching the original."
3,SUPER 8,"This was a ok movie with a weird plot. My children and I watched it and we are were a little confused sometimes, but it is worth looking at a second time (maybe)."
3,"Collage of E.T., Close Encounters and other such stuff","J.J. Abrams - Director / Writer / Producer presents us with a love story that incidentally is visited now and then by an alien. Marketed as a sort of kids ""Blaire Witch"" story, the film is a pale reflection of ""The Goonies"" (1985.)Basically kids making a movie witness a train wreck and possibly something else. We know that they are in trouble as ""poof"" out of nowhere men in uniforms with flashlights appears.There is a disclaimer in the beginning of the film but there does seem to be a lot of gratuitous potty mouth in the presentation.Even if the plot was formula and many times formula can be fun, Elle Fanning excelled as a zombie. See her earlier works as Phoebe Lichten in ""Phoebe in Wonderland"" (2008)."
3,Spielberg-esque,"I didn't know much about Super 8 going in - other than it was directed by JJ Abrams. It was a fun film, and there were great performances by the child actors. Def. worth a watch."
2,Super-8; not really super,This movie had great potential but really fell short. If I had gone to the movie theater to see this movie I would have been terribly disappointed.
5,"""Drugs are so bad!""","I LOVED this movie! First of all, I am not a sci-fi fan, never have been. I read the synopsis of the movie and didn't realize when I first started it that it was science fiction. By the time I realized it was I was so into it that I had to finish it. The characters are real, and you find yourself really caring what happens to them. The actors are increible, especially the children!!! I can't emphasize that enough! I highly recommend this movie. My 14 year old son liked it almost as much as I did! I don't want to give anything away, but the end had me almost in tears. Also, great music that I'm (almost) too old to remember! Keep watching after the movie is finished and you will get to see the ""movie"" that the kids made."
4,Scenes came in dark on my macbook.,"Not sure what the image difference is from a TV to a laptop, but watched this on my Macbook and a lot of the scenes were very dark. If they were outside at night or in a dark room, it became very hard to see everything that was going on.And for some strange reason this reminded me of something like the Goonies, an adventure movie with kid actors. Interesting movie, it's a good watch."
1,BORING!!!!!,i don't understand what do Spielberg with this film try to copy ET or GOONIES?? how an ALIEN make a ship with garbage! and why wait 40 years to do that! or simply this movie is a precuel of CLOVERFIELD is the clone????? better movie of monster is THE TROLL HUNTER
1,Play it for ten minutes then turn it off.,"After the first ten minutes of the movie, I was ready for a nonstop sci-fi thrill ride. I was extremely disappointed. The rest of the movie is completely disjointed and has no idea what it should be. Way to many plot lines and none are fully resolved.And just out of curiosity, why would the AIR FORCE put the world's most valuable military secret on an unguarded train; traveling through the middle of the country?"
2,Train wreck????,"This film kind of lost me at the train wreck...I've seen a train hit a truck, in fact a box truck not a pickup. The train just swatted the truck aside (destroying it in the process) and continued on, with out derailing a single car. This crash was as though the train had hit an immovable wall, propelling huge freight cars through the air as though they were weightless, at least until they hit the ground.Speilberg does love his CGI....but it doesn't make a movie."
1,Gawd awful,Preposterous plot. Characters with no depth. Bad SFX. Gawd awful. No worth the time I spent watching it. Save your money.
2,Dull,"Too scary for young kids, and too boring for older kids, Super 8 is selling only one thing, really...nostalgia. However, the movie tries so hard to invoke the look and feel of those films from the late 70's, early 80's that those who grew up back then remember so fondly, it forgets to be a good movie in its own right. The sentiment is all cheap, the plot is all recycled, the action is all generic, and as good as the child actors are, they're still child actors. I heard so many people say they liked this movie without offering up even the vaguest of specifics as to why, and now that I've seen it, I think I know: even if you fall to its nostalgic charms, you won't remember a bit of this eminently forgettable movie in a few days; you'll remember the movies it's trying to remind you off.Rent before you buy."
1,Oh come on ET phone home again,"Oh come on besides some cool special effects, just how many times have we seen this movie before? It really did not grab my attention at all"
2,Super 8 rental,The movie had all the childhood charm of most typical Stephen king movies but the actual plot was a little far fetched and lacked a good story. Not one of his best performances by far but worth watching at least once in life. Any more than that I wouldn't reccomend.
3,Not ET,"We thought the acting was good. The special effects especially during the train crash were enough to make you sit up straight in your seat. After the train crash, the movie got more and more incredible. With the writer producer team of JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg we really expected a movie in the ET class - it was NOT. The thing that bothered me most is that depicting the US military as the villain is a movie ploy that is shabby and has gotten threadbare with repeated use. We just expected better."
2,Intellectual Pablum,"In a world where there is really very little that is new or refreshing, this turkey fits right in. If you love obviously miniaturized train crashes where a guy driving an old beat-up pickup truck can survive a head-on crash with a fast-moving freight train, and totally derail it in the process. If you can accept that premise, silly, overused plot-concept, poor character development and CGI from 15 or 20 years ago, this is your movie. Big mistake for me!Since I seem to have not learned anything from this drivel, I just rented Cowboys and Aliens. I wonder how that review will go? But then, I continue to watch Sons of Anarchy. Sometimes I wonder if I stuck my head in a Mix-master as a child?"
5,Spielberg alien film with interesting twist,"Another classic Spielberg fascination with aliens from another world but this one is more akin to E.T. and not Alien, less scary and more interesting."
3,super 8,good teen movie and even for 12 year olds . older adult may enjoy it to . its a monster found by the usa government who escapes specil effects are good actors are good and will the story kinda lacking but worth seeing or buying
3,"Entertaing, okay movie","I thought this movie started out great, but then got a little cartoonish. I liked it and at the same time wish it was a better story."
4,Super 8 for my Nephew,Nephew put this movie on his Christmas list. He really likes the movie. His aunt and uncle likes this movie as well.
2,I didn't like the movie quality,"I wish Amazon would allow HD quality movies on PCs. As it stands, I was simply uninterested in watching Super 8 to the finish due to the low resolution."
4,"""ET"" meets ""The Iron Giant""","Very well done, but a little scary for some of the younger crowd; otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
3,Entertaining,"A little far-fetched, with kids out in the middle of the night trying to film a video and stumbling onto a government conspiracy. Not a flim you'd want to watch twice, but it all turns out OK."
3,Nothing new.........but it's entertaining.,"Nothing really new or amazing here. An alien escaped a train car and some kids found out about it. Now they try to uncover the mystery behind the disappearances of local townspeople.I felt like I was treading heavily through some of the cheesy, emotional plot. I was entertained; however, and eager to learn more about the alien."
2,What was that?,"It is a kids movie with marijuana. What is the target audience for this film? Not for adults and Kids can not watch it!Take Goonies (kids experimenting?), Close Encounters (the grand evacuation), ET (in the end, the alien was a misunderstood cutie), Transformers (the self assembling cubes), Cloverfield (the monster is a reduced copy, and at least Cloverfield was a very original movie, despite being a financial disaster), a totally unnecessary joint (for the funny guy) and a giant industrial blender (to put all the aforementioned together in a soapbox format) and you have this movie. Nothing original and truly disappointing."
2,Just didn't do it for me,"""Super 8"" has lots of great parts to it: nerdy kids pursuing their passion, budding young love, government conspiracies, and a pretty cool monster, left just shadowy enough to engage the viewer's imagination. Given the potential of these ingredients, I'm not sure why it didn't do more for me.Maybe part of it was the navel-gazing aspect of a movie made about tweenage movie-makers, as if someone was trying to write an autobiography the way it should have been. Maybe it was the triteness of anthropophagy - as if earthly proteins would do anything for a visitor from elsewhere. Maybe ... well it doesn't matter. I'm not asking for my money back, but I have no reason to see it again.-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters"
1,I've seen this before,"A cute, big eyed alien lands in a saucer, befriends children on bicycles, and makes a phone call. It is a very cute British children's film from 1955 called SUPERSONIC SAUCER. It was laughable watching Spielberg remake this film in 1977 as CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (several versions; he strives for perfection, after all) and in 1982 as E.T., not to mention 1987 as *BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED. He continues to remake this British film. It is now vomitous. Are we not lucky to have ""fresh"" visions and ""talented"" filmmakers among us? Look up at the sky with a stupid expression if you disagree."
1,It was awful,"This was one of the worse movie ever made, it was another Cloverfield. We lost interest after 15 minutes, the previews made it look good, but it wasn't. The kids did great, they have a future in acting. Rent it if you don't believe me but don't waste your money buying it, it is a watch once movie."
2,NOT Speilberg's best work at all!!,"When I first saw the trailers for this I was instantly drawn in. The moment I found out that SPEILBERG had done this movie, I knew it was a MUST SEE. After waiting almost a year to see this train wreck of a movie, I was VERY dissappointed. The movie dragged throughout and there was no , EDGE OF YOUR SEAT type moments, we all just sat there waiting for ANYTHING.The timeframe of the movie was perfect and the cinematography was excellent, but the story line was weak and lacking. This movie came to theaters the day I got married and I am so glad we did not go see this. I want the $5 back I paid to see this. This movie could have been a BLOCKBUSTER, but it is honestly just horrible. Speilberg is losing his touch and he should never work with JJ Abrams ever again!"
2,"one more for ""BORING""!","I would give this movie one star, but thought the makers deserved at least two for what appeared to be an excruciating effort to make something out of nothing. I stuck it out, but ran the last part captioned at higher speed.Super 8 gives new meaning to the term ""derivative."" It's also NOT a kid's movie, full of hyperactive and desensitizing violence, gore, and pandering. Fanning was refreshing, but the other characters frankly sucked.I just finished the whole X-Files series from my local library. This seemed like a very bad X-Files, dumbed down for kids. Not to mention ET, Close Encounters, and almost every other Spielbergian flick ever made.Steve . . . give it a rest."
4,"fun, well-paced","The troupe of kid filmmakers were great. The monster itself was a little disappointing but it was all made up for by the characters. It felt like a big budget, more grown up Scooby Doo episode, except the monster was real in the end >.<"
5,One of our favorite films!,We own the dvd and love it. The kids in the cast are great and the movie is well done. Being able to watch it on my Kindle was great! I would highly recommend the film as well as watching it as a download from Amazon.
3,"Zombies and Aliens, a unique combination","Not bad. A zombie movie wrapped in an alien movie. The plot line was a little corny at times and the subplot was kind of predictable, but in all, it was pretty well done."
4,Surprisingly good,"I usually don't like movies about kids, but this one had the same kind of appeal that Goonies had. It does draw you in. It also has one of the best train wrecks I've ever seen in a movie. If you listened to certain dialogue midway through the movie, you got tipped off as to what would ultimately happen. It's been a very long time since I was a kid and I had to laugh about how serious they were about their movie project. Still, they were quite believable and the mix of character personalities was good. Ron Eldard, whose name, I had to look up, put in a very nice performance. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the pieces fit together a little too neatly, at the end. Still, a fun movie."
4,A phenomenal sci-fi adventure,"J.J. Abrams and the immortal Spielberg have undoubtedly produced an instant classic. Super 8 is the kind of film moviegoers have been waiting to see for years. The lowered standards for films of the 21st century will likely help this one to stand out from the crowd. A great CG performance, effects, and score encourage the stellar acting. The film showcases Elle Fanning and Kyle Chandler's talent, as well as a solid performance from Joel Courtney. The tale of the monster and the army men who failed to understand his journey is poignant and powerful, even if somewhat formulaic.Super 8 is a perfect film for the whole family, provided no one is too squeamish. Some scenes may be fairly intense for young audiences.Overall, Super 8 is a well-made film with something for everyone."
2,Seen this 6 other times...,"It's like an odd mashup of Jurassic Park, Stand By Me, District 9... And many other movies I've seen before. I'm really surprised because I typically like the people involved. At least I didn't pay to see this in the theaters! That's why I love cheap rentals on Amazon!"
1,"Awful movie. Save yourself, watch E.T. instead...","Lousy story line, boring movie on the whole. I think it was trying to be E.T. but failed miserably. Too dark, awful sound, awful everything! Ugh ...I'm so angry right now that this movie passed through the ranks and made its way to my eyes. Its right up there (or should I say down there) with Lady In the Water."
2,Boring,"I found this movie hyped and kind of lazy. Not all is bad, the idea is good (the kind of short novel/story made into a movie worse than the book)."
4,Well made and entertaining,"Super 8 is a homage to extra terrestrial films and is one of the better film to come during the summer in 2010. The characters are believable, you start to like the children and identify their passion for adventure and film making. They are the soul and the best thing. The adults are more or less props, except for Kyle Chandler and Ron Eidard who have substantial roles. There are some flaws, I did not feel a emotional connect with the alien. There are also a few minor characters whom I felt deserved some screen time such as the science teacher and the military guy. However this is a exceptional film in many respects. Abrams and his crew capture the ambiance of a small town and the essence of childhood curiosity. Four stars. 2/18/2012"
4,Great Movie,"Loved the movie! It reminds me of ""The Goonies"" Very action packed! It will keep you on the edge of your seat!"
3,Intersting Science Fiction Movie,"I just watched the Super 8 movie and found it to be of great interest and entertaining. Without going into specifics, it really is a movie dealing lives of younger teens, an alien, the local town with its population experiencing havoc from the USAF military trying to catch the alien.An ideal film for children and adults or the entire family."
3,Genre of its own,"This movie is in a class of its own. It would be difficult to say if this is coming of age movie, drama science fiction or a zombie movie but it is a mix of all for sure. Set in 1980s it is a story of five high school buddies determined to make their zombie movie. Bad things happen along the way: one of the boys looses his mother in the accident in a factory where she works; there is an alien on the loose in the small town; and all of these events are interfering with the make of the teeneage zombie movie.It must have been a fun project for Steven Speilberg and his mentoree J. J. Abrams to make. But do not expect high art. It is simply a fun movie to watch with no strings attached."
3,Very Disapointed,"This movie was a nostolgic, but uninspired mash up of older summer blockbusters like Cloverfield, Stand By Me, and ET. The characters were transparent and under developed, the alien monster completely unfrightening and non-threatening, the plot loosely tied together. When the movie mercifully ended, I was left thinking ""Is that it? really?"". I can't award half stars, but I would give it a 2.5."
3,May not be suitable for younger audiences,"I expected this movie to be somewhere between the goonies and ET. The rating is PG13. At first I thought it has the potential to become a cult film, like the two mentioned. As the movie follows a group of teenagers, while making a film they watch a train derail and strange things start to happen. The alien does not show up until the last part of the movie. The alien fights and eats people. While it is not a horror movie, the movie does show people getting crushed and blood splattering (warning for parents with younger kids) and this is the reason I am not sure about it becoming a cult movie. Adults looking for a good alien movie will most likely be disappointed. Again this is more like ET or Goonies with a darker twist and more blood, but not a bad movie. Target audience are probably teenagers."
4,good movie,"Good movie, great sound effects, and story line is fun and easy to enjoy. worth getting and watching more then once."
1,Super 8,"Are you kiddin me, what a waste of a perfect bluray. Do not purchase.Warning,warning cannot believe Spielberg put his name on this bust."
3,Disappointed,"OK, this is an amazing album. That being said, there are 3 songs that are LIVE versions (Body and Soul, Twilight Tone/Twilight Zone, and Trickle Trickle, not the original ""Extensions"" versions. Not that that's bad, but I wanted the studio recordings. The same thing in the iTunes store. What's the deal?"
2,Don't bother with this -- get The Best Of instead,"Like at least one other reviewer, I was initially attracted to this album because of the first track -- Birdland, which is an absolute smash -- and maybe one other (Trickle Trickle, a decent doo wop number that makes you want to dance). But both of those are also on The Very Best Of Manhattan Transfer, along with several others I like, so I saw no reason to invest in this. Although I am a fan of the group, I'm not necessarily a fan of all their song choices: they could do like Tony Bennett and choose only really good tunes. Body And Soul is okay bebop but nothing new, and I could do without all the rest. Do yourself a favor and get either the Best Of album or the Anthology and get more for your money."
3,MDR Review of Man. Tr.,I purchased this CD because of (as it turned out) the first song on the CD. Un fortunately I did not like the rest of the CD nearly as much.
2,One less club,"Order arrived in timely fashion. When I opened box, the #6 iron was missing. I emailed Amazon immediately and, 24 hours later, have not had the courtesy of a reply. What good is email if the company is going to ignore it?"
5,great clubs,"I'm a 28 handicap. In a phrase, great freakin' clubs. I compared these against a set of Callaway Fusions. The Callaway is slightly softer on impact, giving less feedback. The Nickent club flies very straight and very high compared to the Callaway. You can really feel the back weighting when you swing it. Distance was a good 20 yards longer for me than the Callaway. I hit the 5 iron ~200yd consistently, and I have a pretty low swing speed. These clubs offer enough assistance with their weighting that I can really muscle up on my swing, and the result is still +- 10yd left or right. These clubs are just plain better than clubs costing $1k+ for a set. Highly recommended."
4,The Human Riff At Work,"after mick jagger had all but abadoned the stones,keith richards decided he had no choice but to make the music himself and thats just what he did with his solo debut,this record is a great display of richards guitar skills and shows off how truly essential he was to the stones,standout tracks for me were ""take it so hard"" and the anti jagger ""you dont move me"" which tells you how far the betrayal keith felt went.in any event this is a great rock record and if you like the stones sound you will find this enjoyable, though keiths sandpaper voice may be hard to swollow,I've come to enjoy it,I highly reccomend this album and its succesor album ""main offender"" which I think is even better"
5,A riffhard classic,"Keith simply does it all on this album: Stonesy garage rock, Chuck Berry raveups, menacing funk, boozy ballads. Truly shows you who the punk-rock soul and songwriting foundation of the Stones has been for all these years. Riffs everywhere you look, plus swagger and attitude, great arrangements and production, and superb taste in supporting musicians."
2,not a forgotten 'classic'; probably forgotten for a reason,"Its a struggle to find songs that are great on this album. Its not rock, like rock guitar music. Keith has a weak voice, not warn with age; just weak.The production is good. The project was a one off try by Virgin to milk money out of Richard's fame.It is a bar band at best. I think the album belongs in the bargain bin at Big Lots.All the reviews here are blatantly over supportive of Mr. Richard's; and over praise this album."
3,what is the big deal?,I think this album has one great song on it. Where are the great melodies? It's just a bunch of riffs! That one great song is the duet he does with Sara Dash. It is beautiful! I couldn't get into anything else. Give me any Stones album anyday over this(except the ones after 1980.) I just thought it was boring.
2,Vocals Are Cheap,"Richards writes pretty hooky rock music and uses the same sort of clichéd lyrics that brought the Stones greatness, but Mick Jagger, he ain't. To put it another way, he can't sing. Indeed, his vocals are so tentative and mixed so badly back that it's possible to believe there is no singer (maybe this was the engineer's intention). It seems clear that without Mick there would be no Keith, on the other hand, if one listens to Jagger's solo efforts one could equally convinced that the opposite is true. Doubtless they were wise to stick together; the sum is greater than the parts."
3,Sorry Keith,I am a known Stones fan from the rollingstones.com and I love Keith but this cd is not what I expected.
4,Too Much of a good thing.,"This disc makes a guy yearn for the complete accompany of the real Rolling Stones band. The songs seem very alike and lack a brisker lyrical mix up that you always get on a Stones album (sour song-then sweet ballad). I think Richards can get stuck in a rut too much- both riff wise, mood wise, and lyric wise- it can become a little too predictable. Nice to own though, if you need a little filtering."
5,She was the best.,"Watching these shows my initial reaction was how Dusty ran the table stylistically. She could handle ANYTHING better than anyone else. Classic pop, Motown, Folk, Blues, Swing....she was such a pure talent. If you're a fan of Dusty this is essential. My favorite female singer of all time. I've watched these shows repeatedly and I am just in awe of her greatness."
5,A Trove,"The sound varies, and Dusty's carefully constructed image contrasts with the voice almost constantly but this is a lost trove of songs she didn't record, particularly show and folk and introspective material. Particularly loved the Cockney take on 'Sweet Charity''s ""If My Friends Could See Me Now"".Hope the appeal inside leads to more found material and a volume two. How about Scott Walker's shows?"
3,For serious fans,"In my opinion this is for serious fans only. This is a series of TV programs (in black and white) with few if any of the popular songs we know about Dusty. While she is an amazing singer, if you expect the hits and a color video, look somewhere else. There are a couple of pieces in the extras of good sound and color images, but the BW TV shows are ok if you are looking for any material by Dusty, and the sound is just ok also."
1,Far too selectively euphemistic to be of any real use,"This account of the history of the Catholic Church is far too selectively euphemistic to be of any real use. To give just a few examples: the Crusades ""held back the Turk from Europe"" -- the Fourth Crusade is mentioned obliquely, but no mention is made of the extent to which it prepared the eventual Turkish conquest of Constantinople and therewith the invasion of Europe; usury laws are not mentioned, so of course there is no account of their role in the development of the problematic relationship of Catholics and Jews in Europe; Luther's 95 Theses, among the most straightforward documents in any church's history, are characterized as ""drawn up very skillfully and in a style likely to deceive the unwary,"" epithets really better applied to this book. Anyone actually looking for a history of the Catholic Church, as opposed to a catechism, would do best to look elsewhere."
2,Beware,"The ""current"" in the title is 1944. This is a re-issue of a book first published in 1930.There are interesting stories - but this is not a history that takes into account the second half of the 20th cnetury."
2,Damon Robers Brow Gain,I have been using this product now for 3 weeks and have not noticed any change at all. The product size is very small for the amount I paid for it
1,junk,The Damone Roberts Beverly Hills - Brow Gain I have been using this product for about 4 weeks now and i don't see any improvement and if you don't plug your eyebrow for that long i'm sure some of them will grow back out plus I feel that after the second week the bottle is empty and they charge too much for that little bit product.
1,I used this product per the instructions for 7 weeks and had zero regrowth.,I have naturally sparse eyebrows and bought this product in hopes of getting even a little bit of extra growth. I used it twice a day for 7 weeks and photographed my results weekly. There was absolutely no new growth. This product may help people who have over plucked/waxed have faster regrowth but it will not give you new growth where your brows are naturally bare.
3,Better than nothing...,"I have been using Brow Gain for two months and it helped some. I definitely have more eyebrow hairs that I did before I started using it. I would say that the difference is that my brows have filled in quite a bit. There are a lot of little hairs growing in that weren't there before, but I didn't have the dramatic response like other reviewers did. It may be my age -- I'm 51, and with hormones changing, it may be that my eyebrows will not be a thick as they used to be.That being said, I started using Latisse two weeks ago and, in addition to using it on my lashes, I'm using it on my brows. Wow! Latisse is really making a difference. I'd say use your $35 towards the purchase of Latisse. That's a better investment."
2,Too soon to tell.,"I don't think we've been using this long enough to see results. At least we haven't seen any results yet, but it says it can take a while, so we're still trying. Sometimes leaves a white film if you don't rub it in well, which is a problem with my 15 year old son (he has lost the outer two-thirds of his eyebrows due to a rare skin disorder.)"
5,Damone Roberts Brow Gel,"When creating an arch, brow hair can be redirected in the direction of the arch with Damone Roberts Brow Gel. I have been using the Brow Gel for sometime. I love it. It doesn't flake and my brows have filled in & look great. I have finally found a product that actually keeps it's promise. I also love his Bling Bling"
3,Not as fun as they look,This item was bought for a 6 year old child who likes to play cops and robbers. The non-messy paint ball like properties was what drew me to the item. Does not work well. The stickers do not stick well so the kids are arguing over whether they got hit or not.
1,Line Thickness Woes,"We use this printer with AutoCAD. Our drawings use different line thicknesses, and the HP 2600 does not seem to recognize anything thinner than the standard width, it will print thick lines. I would think that with a printer of this caliber dpi would be able to print thin lines. We have contacted HP and they were no help in this matter. The printer will also grab 2 sheets of paper frequently - it's only a month old. We are very fond of HP products, we are just dissapointed with this printer."
4,Bike ride,"Bought the bike for my 18 year old daughter who is a competitive swimmer. She likes it.The bike's quality is fine; not stellar, but overall a good deal for the cost."
5,Lucid and Mighty,"Delsol proves she is one of the most astute cultural critics of our times. This book is a tour de force which rips apart the ""politically correct"" thinking and meaninglessness of modern life, revealing just what we are scared of and how it inhibits our search for the truth. This masterpiece fits in with the very best of other writers in the ""Conservative Revolutionary"" approach including Spengler, Evola, Alain de Benoist, Heidegger and others. The writing is superb and her arguments leap off the page and transfix one with their aptness and penetrating insight. It's one of those books you want to send to all your friends and annoy others by reading aloud from it. My favorite parts reveal the agenda behind the ""clandestine ideology"" that works to equalize all behaviors and suspend/repress judgment on everything. She tells it like it and describes what is really going on around us."
4,A poignant read,Battle Creek works well on two levels; as a poignant chronicle between three generations of men and as an exciting baseball story. Scott Lasser writes knowingly of his subjects and effectively uses baseball as a metaphor for life.
2,"A base hit, but not a grand slam","To Scott Lasser's credit he has produced a well-written, thoughtful, well paced novel. I've got to say, though, I'm a little surprised at all the flowery reviews. There was something intangible missing in this book for me. Maybe the characters weren't completely genuine, maybe the story wasn't entirely believable, I'm not sure. I just wasn't moved by the book. That said, it is still an enjoyable book. Just don't expect it to move mountains."
2,Somewhat disappointing...,"An ardent baseball fan, I found this book to be something of a disappointment. While the book certainly lacks little in its description of the details of the game and those involved in it, the plot and characters never seem to ascend beyond cliche. The ending, too, left me wanting for something not just more, but better. A decent first effort for Lasser, but the there are many in the catalog of written works about baseball that I have found more engrossing and enjoyable than Battle Creek."
5,Innovative new study on Samkhya-Yoga metaphysics,"This is an excellent book on (primarily) Samkhya metaphysics, and the most innovative treatment of the subject since G. Larson ""Classical Samkhya"". The author resolves the long standing apparent tension between cosmological-cum-psychological interpretations of Samkhya's tattva-theory by offering a new synchronic and phenomenological interpretation of the tattvas as the necessary conditions for experience to occur. Moreover, the study makes a compelling argument against a realist reading of prakrti. This book is a most welcome contribution to the field."
4,Old MacDonald Had A woodshop,"A different take on Old MacDonald, but after reading this I have all kinds of ideas. For a music class you can use all kinds of hand instructments to make the sounds. I think this will end up be a very fun book to work with."
1,Not for us,"We did not like it this item at all, don't get me wrong the neck support infant was not for are little one. If you have a baby that does not like the carsite and does not like this around there neck then this item is not for you. That way this item did not work for us. Our daughter hated the car site, and did not like nothing around her neck. If you don't have a promblems with that you should buy this. I giving this a one because this was not for us."
1,Haynes Xtreme Customizing In-Car Entertainment Review,"A worthless book-very dissappointed in the content-I bought it because I thought it would help me install an overhead dvd monitor in my car-at least that's what the description tells you-and would be a good reference book to have to install a radio and speakers if I ever wanted to, but to install an overhaed dvd monitor takes some knowledge and time-this book had a total of 2-yeah that's right-2 pages of how to do this most of it just pictures of installing it. The total amount of words describing how to do it on these 2 pages was less than a paragraph! What a joke. Not one thing about electrical hook up either, which is the thing I needed the most. The adverstising for this book is very misleading. I would of selected 0 stars for this book but it didnt give me that option. I returned it for a refund."
5,A loving look at a way of life that has past,"Unusual for books about Africa in its time period, this book gives an open-hearted look at life for the Mano people in Liberia before the Second World War. It also shows how that way of life, certainly gone today, was disappearing twenty years after the author's original visit. Unusual for books of this sort, Ms. Dendel shares little about herself and writes instead about the people with whom she becomes friends. She does not show even unspoken attitudes of white supremacy, but instead what she, and all of us, could learn from the lives and attitudes of these people. A lot of the negatives of the lives of the people she describes, particularly relating to the role of women in traditional society, are not mentioned, but this book is not a scholarly treatise, just a discussion of the author's experiences. For anyone interested in indigenous African culture, this out-of-print book is worth finding."
5,"delicious, delectable, delightful & de-lovely! [*grin*]","howdy y'all,this is WONDERFUL stuff! i make it with olive oil instead of butter and with grilled beef sausage & chicken breast chunks instead of ground beef. it's spicy, tasty and filling. it reheats nicely, too. goes well in a burrito-size four tortilla, in a pita or all by itself. it meets all of my requirements, all of my expectations AND exceeds them by a good bit.rated a FIVE cuz it's fab. [*grin*]take care,lee"
4,Classic tunes from the 1950's,"Polly Bergen was a female vocalist who put out some neat songs and lush ballads in the 1950's. They are all here folks. This CD shows both of her sides: the cute comedic songs with up-tempo charts, and the torch songs and ballads that showcased her great voice. She belongs up there with the great female vocalists of the period (Peggy Lee, Rosemary Clooney, Doris Day to name a few). She does not disappoint the listener."
4,Memories,"Brings back memories from my days in San Diego. Even when they are driving down the freeway and going off on ramps, I know right where they are. I enjoyed the humor along with the serious. Great DVD."
4,The real Simon & Simon!,"I warmly advice everybody who loves the telefilms of the 80's to buy this box. Infact, with this ""Simon & Simon season 2"" you really go back to those episodes where everything worked to perfection: from the plot to the action scenes, from the music to the humor... Those 2 guys are great.Simon & Simon season 2 makes you forgive the slow start of season 1.Get ready for hours of relaxation, smiles, loughs and some nostalgy for this kind of show."
5,Just as good as I remembered,"I enjoy watching this dvd, it is just as wonderful as the first season. I only hope I do not have to wait as long for the rest of the series to come out on dvd."
5,Good PI shows,Can't wait for the Second Season to come. Have waited several years for it to be released. Can't wait for the other seasons to be released also. Good PI shows!!
1,sarahmusic1 discrepency,"i ordered 2 items and received partial order.the 3 dvd set, legends, was satisfactory.the second set, a 9 dvd set was only partially sent and am in middle of dispute/claim with amazon and my credit card company as i was charged $100 for something i never received.not happy at ALL with amazon or sarahmusic1 at this time."
3,Camp use rat bait.,never really know because it is used at a camp in the country where there is a continual supply of mice but the mice are eating the bait.
1,Mistranslation makes readers tired and exhausted.,"There can be no argument that the original version is an impressive manga.But this English version has a bunch of mistakes in English translation. Some key words have been transformed into totally wrong meaning.To ignore that, I should not have read it in Japanese. But these wrong translations have already degraded this manga's value. Some of them actually make no sense. There are so many vital mistakes that I cannot raise an example!That's why, I cannot recommend you to read this. You should learn reading Japanese and buy the original version, which is totally really cool!"
2,Despite what they say - not for medium or large birds.,"My Goffin cockatoo, Kelly Puffyfeathers, was able to destroy this in only a few days. They don't list the dimensions for this toy, just saying it is for medium and large birds. I was surprised to find that the dome portion is only about 3 inches tall. Kelly removed the ring at the top in 10 minutes and then when I tied it to his cage with one of the fabric dangles, proceeded to demolish the remainder in less than a week. I will say he had a lot of fun doing so but as far as price to length of playing time ratio, this failed in my opinion. I believe it would be fun for a smaller bird. However, since my 1 pound Goffin was able to do it in quickly, it would need to be a small parrot."
1,Dissapointing,"With so many great Mel Tome albums out there, don't waste your money on this. I'd spend the money on his Concord Records' box set with George Shearing. Only, Lady Be Good & Bluesette should be on this cd. Mel didn't have the chemistry with Buddy Rich that he had with Shearing. The top 10 hits, You Are the Sunshine of My Life & I Won't Last a Day, were done far better in a jazz style by Carmen McRae. Mel did much better studio recordings on Concord & Bethlehem. You ask what about his numerous live recordings? WELL, AMEN!"
3,3 and 1/2 stars..,i've read over 10 books in the smiths/morrissey vein and this one's good. the author's also a fan. very insightful.
2,Not for professionals,Investors with some knowledge on the fundamental economic and accounting issues will find this book rather childish.
5,"The latest info on the subject, easy to understand",As marketing manager for 2milebay.com (an offshore services company) I have searched the world for the best book to offer. This is it. Terry does a great job explaining the issues and helping you to understand how to set up your own offshore strategy. Must reading if you're serious about this!
5,Excellent easy to understand book,I really enjoyed Mr. Neal's book. It was easy to uderstand and to read. The book contains lots of usefull information that you can use right away.
2,Interesting yet lack of tactics.,"Terry Neal writes an appealing book on the offshore realm, but doesn't give many tactial and logistical details. His information is based on known facts that anyone can gather from the local library. I enjoyed his view, but would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,"""An excellent teacher!""","I have just finished The Offshore Advantage and couldn't be more pleased. Great concepts, great stories, and straight talk from a great teacher. Thanks Mr. Neal."
4,helpful and informative,"Recently the AICPA has endorsed a training program geared to teach it membership (US accountants) how to use business structures available only by going ""offshore"". In an attempt to review information available on this subject in the popular media, I found this book.Mr Neal does a good job of teaching that while tax reduction should not be your PRIMARY reason for going offshore, that there are still many tax benifits available by doing so. Also that there is no better asset protection available than a properly, legally organized offshore corporation.From a professional point of view, this is a great introduction for successful business people interested in a facinating new world of opportunities."
3,Slim on details...,"One does not get much detail on ""How"" to go offshore. It would be refreshing to hear some real details. I am convinced that there is an advantage to the ""Offshore"" account, but what good is the information without the way to do it and the pitfalls along the way. William Wantuck, Houston TX..."
1,One-sided approach--discusses benefits but conceals risks,"The book is promotional in nature, with very little substance in terms of ""strategy"" and analogy (probably because the author, who also owns the publishing company, is constantly encouraging the reader to contact his own offshore consulting entities to purchase additional services).Thus, the reader should be cautious before investing offshore: how are his funds protected? what regulatory agencies will assist when funds disappear? And what about litigation laws... they can actually backfire!In summary, the author, Terry Neal, spends a lot of time promoting the idea of shelter from the IRS and SEC, but fails to mention that he himself is under investigation by IRS and SEC!"
1,A Total Waste of Time & Money,Just do a search on the internet and you'll have more information than this sales pitch has to offer and save money. Seldom have I seen such a worthless book.
1,a waste of time,"This book is not worth the time it takes to read. It is nothing but a long sales pitch for consulting services, which (surprise!) the author would be more than happy to provide.Which makes one wonder where the glowing reviews come from..."
4,Great,good music at a great price/ just the rite amount of the jazzy & whisky blues mix..recommended highly as a gift or for a personal connection
2,Sterile and Overproduced,"I love the blues, and have always heard about Cray so I finally got this CD. Admittedly talented, with a beautiful voice and sure hand, I personally find this CD to be TOO note-perfect and frankly devoid of any real emotion. The talent is there, but where is the heart?"
3,A little disappointing,"I have to admit, I am not very familiar with his music, but I heard one of Robert Cray's songs a while back and loved it. However, this CD was a little disappointing. All of the songs sounded so similar that I got tired of listening. I'll probably pick and choose a few songs from the CD from now on rather than playing the whole thing."
5,Web Design in a Nushell,Great if you are new to web design and need a reference to give you the essentials and get you up and running fast. I used this book with Macromedia's Dreamweaver and I was building interesting data driven sites in a week.
4,Great reference,"I've used this book more than any other technical book I've ever owned. It's always by my side when I'm doing a large amount of HTML and CSS development. It's extraordinarily organized, and I refer to it constantly. The only reason I can't give this title five stars is that by my rating system it's not absolutely essential reading for technical leaders. There are other books that have the same reference material as this one; however, none of them do as good a job conveying it.I own the first edition, and it's since been updated. (I need to by the new edition myself.) You should strongly consider getting The Web Design CD Bookshelf CD-ROM which includes a paper and electronic edition of the second edition plus electronic editions of five more great O'Reilly titles. Having this as an eBook on your laptop would be an incredibly useful resource."
2,600 pages of HTML.,"As someone who has struggled with the user un-friendly GoLive I bought this book hoping for some clarity. But this is some nutshell--it reads (and visually appears) like The United States Penal Code In A Nutshell.If you are a professional web designer and you need a reference that's like the unabridged dictionary, this might do it.Granted, Dreamweaver and GoLive are so complex, you probably could just write your own code. But no thanks.There is one lesson that this book really brings home. Desiging an exciting site that looks good on all monitors and with all browsers, is not fun, is not easy and is not user friendly. But that's not the book's fault.In fairness, this is not the most difficult book out there. If you just can't get enough complexity there are the Real World books."
5,Outstanding Material (slightly outdated by now though),"Let me get this out of the way first: The information in this book is somewhat outdated by now. I wish there was a more current edition available.With that being said; I found the information in this book to be most helpful. For the topic that it covers, it is the most efficiently comprehensive reference I have found. it provided me with a great understanding of things to consider when developing for the internet and also provided many examples/tips for tackling common webpage design problems. I felt the book was laid out very well and as a reference, I have had no trouble finding information when I have needed it. I found this book to be very easy to read and understand. My hat's off to Jennifer! Very nicely done!"
5,First edition was great!,"I am buying the second ed. because the first was terrific! For an html newbie, I was able to create a working web site with this book. Excellent organization, great examples, and I really like the way she explained the problems one faces with various codes, approaches, and how to avoid or overcome them. I'd say this is one of the best technical books I've ever read.Harry"
4,Beginner's Reference,"Whether First of Second edition, this book is definitely dated material, and in need of regular update. So, there a certainly parts that no longer apply to the current state of Web Design.However, there are still portions that are pertinent and valuable for web designers, especially those just getting into the art. The author offers guidance from broad design principles to specifics of forms, frames and graphics. The basics have not really changed, just the tools. The layout of the book by topic makes it very useful for reference and the samples provide a basis for the budding web developer and designer (WDaD) to build on. Couple this book with any of a number of good HTML and Scripting books and the new WDaD will be well on their way toward designing usable and appealing web sites.Bottom line - not worth list price at the time of this review; if you can get it at a steep discount it is still worth getting. P-)"
5,Mattie Moss Clark,"Being a long time fan of this lady, the book really ties in all the loose ends of her life as a musician, songwriter & choir director. It was a great transaction & I received the book in great condition. I am a musician/singer/songwriter/producer with Amazon carrying my product presently & am plannng to write a book about my mom. This really gives me guidelines about my up coming book that I look forward to also having on Amazon along w/my cd (Samuel OBie-Family & Friends). Thnx, Amazon, I look forward to doing business w/u again soon."
3,high quality case,"Although I like this case,the nikon s10 fits a little tight. The problem is the small round plastic cover that comes with the camera which covers the lens. When you zip it fully it makes an awkward shape. It is as if the case is made for the camera without the cover for the lens. But who would use a camera without a protection ? It is hard to zip the case over the camera but I guess it will eventually take a more convenient shape."
5,good,this is a good line.its strong and can not be seen by fish.its eazy to cast.nice price.you will like it.
3,Weak!,"Line is weak got 1/3rd. way spooling onto reel and it snapped, no real tension on line shouldnt have happened outside of that seller lived up to my satisfaction jus not the line."
2,Going back to mono,"I bought some 10-lb test Berkley Vanish a few weeks ago, and re-spooled both my spinning reels with it. I bought it mostly because I liked what I had read about fluorocarbon being less visible to fish underwater. I fish in a clearwater lake, and the fish can be pretty discriminatory when it comes to deciding what to eat, so I didn't want them seeing my line. Anyway, I caught some fish, so I'm not giving the line a 1-star rating, but, in the end, Berkley Vanish can only muster 2-stars.Cons: the stuff just gets twisted, tangled, and coiled worse than anything I have seen. It was a real problem when I was fishing. Loops of line would force themselves off my reel and tangle around the handle, etc. I had to cut off the line and strip yards and yards of it several times, only to have to re-tie so I could keep fishing.A friend of mine told me that the Trilene Fluoro is better stuff, and he urged me to go with that, but odds are I'm going back to Stren Lo-Vis Green monofilament."
4,"Good product for price, great service",I found the strap and band to be of good quality at a great price. Service was outstanding.
5,The Beginning,The neophyte collector needs this well illustrated and helpful guide. Taking you from the origin of paper weights and introducing you to the modern artist. A must have!
3,paperweights,did not know it was a recycled library book. got what I paid for. Service was very good. Book was less than helpful
4,Good introduction to paperweights,A very nice introduction to paperweights ~ good photography as well as interesting information on the history and types of weights.
2,"Not white, came black.","The item came in black when I really needed white. It arrived fine, no problems, just not the correct color. When you are using it as a theatrical prop it is important to make sure your product matches the picture."
1,Save your money,"I was a HUGE fan of the Feather Touch razor with its phenomenal ability to produce a baby soft shave. So when I discovered there was an updated version with a rechargeable battery, I jumped right on it.The new sleek design is definitely appealing, however, that's about where the appeal ends. First of all, the shave itself was not nearly as close as the original version. I went over the same areas over and over, yet this version was unable to give me the same close shave as its predecessor.The worst part, the rechargeable aspect of the Body Bare is a joke. There is maybe a 10-minute charge, which is quite an inconvenience when the charge runs out in the middle of a shave.I would suggest sticking to the battery-operated version until the rechargeable version goes through some major and much-needed improvements."
1,Not worth it...,"Did not work as advertised for me or my partner. This razor seems underpowered and does a very poor job for me & my wife. I have fairly fine pubic hair, and after following the directions carefully found that it did not leave me ""bare"" at all. I am going back to a sharp blade, which seems to work best. I recommend you streer clear of this unit."
1,Not so great.,"The Body Bare shaver never performed the way the company claims that it will. The people who have reviewed this item with 3, 4, or 5 stars must have gotten a special razor that was made before the item became popular, because I think the newest models are horrible. Don't waste your money."
2,Foil keeps tearing,"Body Bare was my first choice for pubic hair removal. Although it worked fairly well for a while and I liked the rechargeable aspect, my first shaver got a tear in the foil top making it unusable. So I bought a second one. Worked for a while, then the foil tore. Bought a third one. Same problem. This time I tried to purchase just a replacement foil but that was so expensive I just bought a fourth shaver. Again, it worked for a few months until a hole developed in the foil. Finally, realizing that repeating the same actions over and over and expecting a different result was the very definition of insanity (DUH!) this time I bought a Seiko CleanCut and I really like the shave it gives much better. I'm hoping the foil lasts longer."
3,It was okay,"It was an overall good buy, the trimmer worked very well but the shaver itself was just okay. In certain areas the shaver did its job very well but in other areas it didn't even seem like it was shaving any hair."
3,shaver,"The shaver works well and doesn't really bother the skin, but it is very time consuming. Overall a good product."
1,worthless,this thing is worthless. it doesn't give a razor burn but it doesn't do any shaving. I bought this for my girlfriend and after 2 uses it's been tossed. save your money
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Do NOT BUY this PRODUCT!!! Neither of these 2 products do anything they claim to. After using either/ both I still had to use my old shaver which I was trying to replace when buying this combo. Very disappointing and then for that price ?! Do not waste your money. I would not even give this bundle one star, but the review won't be processed unless you choose at least one star!!!!"
2,Waste of money,"This shaver does not provide a very close shave. The only type of person this might work for is someone with light hair. If you have dark hair and light skin, you will be able to see the stubble left behind. It is also very tedious to use, because it has to be kept up every day, it has to be stubble and no longer, and powder must be used. In certain areas it is difficult to manuveur and will not shave the hair all the way. It would be bad enough having to shave in the shower every day, but this makes it even more difficult because it must be done outside of the shower.The trimmer is the worst of all, it's loud and doesn't do a very good job. It cuts your skin very easily.I'd like to know what the ""pros"" or at least famous women use down there besides getting a wax. From what I have seen and tried, shaving does not provide an adequate solution."
2,Shaver,The product is what I want but I have only used it 4 times now and the blades seem to be dull. I can get the same amount of use from a straight razor. What do you suggest? Is this product returnable? I am not so sure it is worth $56
5,Love it,"My wife and I love being able to go bare, it doesn't nick things only thing you have to remember it works only on stubble, and use baby powder"
1,Didn't care for,"I purchased this item and was never able to get it to work. I as given the option by Amazon to send it back but unfortunately I don't always keep up with my e mails, so by the time I got the message, the time frame had past. I just didn't find it very user friend. I followed the instructions but it didn't seem to work. I don't know if there was a flaw with the shaver (didn't seem to be able to hold a charge), or what the problem was."
1,A real disappointment,"Trimmer pinches and painfully pulls hair. Shaver catches 50% of the hair at best. I was hopeful, but no luck here."
2,Sad and Broken,This product worked great the first time I used it. I have sensitive skin on my bikini line and this product finally gave me the shave I wanted without the pain. Less than a week after I bought the shaver the bottom battery cover fell off and the product no longer works. I have tried to reattach the bottom multiple ways with no luck. This product was not worth the 50 something dollars that I paid for it. Big disappointment!
2,La segunda vez no fue tan buena,La razon por la que compre este libro fue por que me acuerdo haberlo leido en mi infancia. Esta segunda vez encontre la historia un poco alargada. No lo recomiendo.
2,A Nice Attempt,"Being one of the few videos on the sinking of the Andrea Doria I was disapointed with this from the start. The version I have is on DVD, and is a very poor quality copy, very gassy.This documentary is about an hour in length, and was made very cheaply. A large portion of the video shows a narrator, with the rest of the video made up of photographs that were filmed out of pages of books, and clips from the public domain Universal Newsreel of the sinking of the Andrea Doria.There are some interviews with survivors of the sinking, interviewed at a yearly gathering of Andrea Doria survivors at a Long Island restaurant, as well as some underwater footage of the wreck, but overall I found this a highly disapointing program."
5,Great Price for a great product!,If you like jerkey purchase jack links...You can spend 1.50 a piece for these at the store and you get a 24 pack for a low price!
1,very cheaply made,"These plastic trays are not built to spec's that they say. You can insert one more chip in each row, the plastic is not of the best quality.I would not recommend to anyone."
5,good heavy duty product,This is a good heavy duty product. It takes all the weight of real poker chips with stacking and carry case too.
2,Not big enough,"I ordered and received these racks in a very timely manner. However, when I went try them out, they only held 19 chips per row, not 20. Other reviewers commented that they could hold up to 21, but mine could not. I thought I had 11.5 gram chips, so not sure why they won't fit. Had to return them as it wouldn't work for poker night only holding 19 chips per row. Return process was very easy."
3,Not a total loss.,"Larger (39mm)chips don't stand up in these trays. The slots are wide enough to accomodate them, but they tend to fall over unless supported by other chips. Aside from that the construction seems fine."
5,prefill for games,"These are great to pre-fill with the same number of chips for each player. Then when you want to have a game, simply hand each player a tray. Each player then begins the game with the same amount of chips without having to spend time counting out chips one at a time for everyone."
4,Big Hit,"These were a big hit at my weekly poker night. All the players liked them and have expressed interest in getting them for their houses.I just have one small issue with them which is why I didn't give them five stars. I use these quite often in the casinos and the ones there are much deeper. These are very very shallow and you have to be really careful not to tilt them at all or the chips will come flying out. I'm sure these were made that way to save a bit of money but because of that fact when I buy them again I will look elsewhere. That being said, for a casual poker night at home they are just fine."
4,Great item for the price,"Bought this set through Amazon.com directly. The quality is pretty good, about the same that I've witnessed at casinos.One of the racks came cracked. The crack is visible but I couldn't feel it when I rubbed my finger against it. Something like that is somewhat expected with a set like this. The one cracked tray did not deter me from ordering another set. I still feel that I will enjoy these trays even though one had an imperfection(whch did not affect use)."
3,Thorough but difficult,"I am a med. student and this book was suggested by the department probably due to the fact that it contains all the necessary information needed. One thing the department has ignored is that it is in some parts impossible to read. I admit that neurobiology is a hard subject, but in my opinion, the purpose of an author is to make it easier to the reader. Not once I was puzzled by the unnecessary complexity of the figures and the text which may be clear to someone who has already taken the course but on the other hand present a total mystery to a beginner.I give this book 3 stars ..."
5,GREAT BUY,"A purchase you will not regret. The unit has excellent specs regardless of the LOW PRICE. I have found the graphics to be well within requirments, providing both a great gaming experiences and a rich work enviroment."
2,It's cheap- that's about it.,"Like other Micro Innovations keyboards keep your manual and drivers around- their web site is seldom up (beyond the first page) when it comes to manuals and drivers. The keyboards are OK- keys are a bit stiff and I find they die within a year or two. Layout of the extra keys is not good- no logical grouping or unique visual queing- you just have to remember what does what or stare the tiny labels. All in all, if you can afford better, get it."
1,Short-life Koyboard,"I bought this keyboard less than 4 months ago, it replaced my original Dell keyboard that was accidentally spilled on.It's very uncomfortable to use, the backspace button is smaller than it is on most keyboards, and the section that is home to the insert, delete, page up and down, home and end keys is a different shape as well.After four months of having this akward keyboard I still wasn't able to write or delete words without having trouble.It eventually died. Before dying, however, it would take at least 5-10 minutes for the keyboard to be usable so I could enter my password and use my computer.I have not spilled or dropped the keyboard, it was kept clean and used with care and died in within months of purchase. I'm currently using my Dell keyboard which has been spilled on, and is over a year old, and it still works."
1,Pure Junk,"I purchased this keyboard at a brick-and-mortar sale. I later saw bad reviews of the Micro Innovations low-end keyboard, but I assumed this one was far superior, for I'd a paid a premium price ... the princely sum of $10 ;)I was mistaken. After less than two months of moderate use (maybe the equivalent of three pages of text per day), the lettering on the ""n"" key wore away, and that's hardly the most used of all the keys. As I recall from the cryptograms I used to enjoy in elementary school, the frequency of letters in English is etaonrishdl ... so the ""n"" key should have lasted longer than four others.It got worse. Last night, after less than three months of usage, many of the keys just stopped working, rendering the keyboard totally useless. Nothing was ever spilled upon it and it sat in an air-conditioned and dust-free room.My conclusion? Buy a real keyboard and beware of trash on sale for cheap."
1,Best of Jane Birkin,"Poor production quality and barely 30 minutes of music. Poor value, oversold and overpriced."
1,"Oh, come on!","I will never be able to figure out how it is that someone with the musical instinct of Serge Gainsbourg would ever get into his head that this woman should be encouraged to sing. She was lovely to look upon, and a very good breather, I grant you, but a singer she most certainly is not."
5,CUPS CUPS CUPS,"I lve these cups, I was on my way on to having a tupperware party...Well not anymore! These cups are WONDERFUL. I have 2 boys 2 and Five years. They love the colors, that you can see through the cup and that it has rubber grips. I love it because it's cheaper and BETTER than tupperware. I just wish they made plates and cereal bowls!"
5,"If you want to listen to quality music, buy this.",This is a great CD and it shows the depth of Manilow's range.
1,"Manilow, what's not to like!","Barry Manilow, defies the odds and survived the decades with music. What's not to like!"
5,Best boxers I've ever bought,These are the only boxers I buy now and probably ever will till they discontinue them. Most comfortable material and fitting boxers ever!
4,Very Roomy!,"Love these boxers. I stole a pair from a friend a while back and had to have a pair of my own. Love the fabric and the cut, not too long not too short, and just the right amount of butt room."
3,It's not their better,"They made after lots of better quality music, and albuns. But, if after all you be a fan, you'll certainnly like it."
2,American Version?,This must be the Americanized version of Guyver. I remember watching the series when I was thirty and it didn't have this horrible soundtrack in the background that just seems to really the enjoyment of the action. It still the original story but somehow it just seems off from the full Japanese version I had watched years ago.
4,yuppp,This started out amazing I was hooked but then it just kindof lagged on not really realing me in keeping me interested then at the end the super guyver suit was so sweet it was really cool and was kept pretty happy endingy for the most part so I was happy.
5,A must for your knotting practice and your bookshelf!,"Geoffrey has outdone himself with this very handy book of knots. The illustrations are clear, the photos expand on the text and relate directly to it and his opening leaves no stone unturned in the knot-tying realm. Geoffrey's other books are good but this one really brings them all together in a very easy to access format. Great job of publishing and of writing!"
3,So-so knot book,"This is the only book about knots that I own, so I can't honestly compare it to any other. But the information in the book is just not adequate. I get completely lost using the photographs because in between the steps the viewing angle can change 180 degrees. Sometimes the language is obtuse at best, talking about working end, and first and second knot, without ever clarifying what the heck it's talking about. Annotated drawings or pictures would have worked so much better. I suggest looking elsewhere."
3,Comfortable But Not Durable,Very comfortable glove. Worked well but stitching came apart very quickly. Unable to use the glove now so will not be purchasing this model again.
1,Pay more for a different glove b/c it will last 6x as long,"I play racquetball twice per week every week. I have regularly used Ektelon Max Tak and Ektelon O3 gloves, and with the exception of one poorly cut glove that chafed my hand, I really like both models. The last time I needed a new glove, both of those were out of stock, so I thought I would try this Controller II, on the theory that although it wouldn't last as long, it was cheaper so I could just buy them more frequently and have a new glove more often for the same total cost.Wrong. The Max Tak and the O3 gloves generally give me about 3 months of play before the palms start to become stiff and shrunken, and another 3 months of good use before they need replacing. This glove is stiff and shrunken after 2 weeks! That's 1/6th as long. The other two also have a much stickier grip. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $4-5 and get yourself a much better ""deal."""
2,Weak seams,"The seam along the index finger of this glove blew out after 3 sessions in the court. It's a shame, because otherwise it seems like a great glove. Cool retro look."
5,Works great for the price,"Not too ""tack-y""; breathable; good grip..... Great glove Great glove Great glove Great glove Great glove Great glove Great glove"
3,the palm of the glove is leather,instead of the sticky surface most gloves have on the palm side - this one is all leather - but still gives a pretty good grip
5,Fits great!,Fits great and feels great on. Good grip and I love the colors. I would Buy it again when this one get nasty.
2,Didn't last long,This racquetball glove did not last longer than a few weeks of pickleball playing. The tips of several fingers wore through even though it had a heavy feel to it. I would have ordered an extra large version it been offered.
5,It could have been real!,This is a book I never would have believed to be fiction unless it told me. The characters feel real. There are a lot of people to keep track of and sometimes it goes back and forth in time but there is a useful family tree in the front of the book that I kept referring to.I got a feel for Costa Rica past and present and I enjoyed the stories of the different characters. I am going to have some of my students read it and I highly recommend it!
2,Static all the time,"This is the worst phone I have ever had. The static is incredibly bad. All the time. The features are great, but the features are useless if all you hear is static."
3,"Good speakerphone, good sound, poor battery life","I bought this phone for the sound quality, styling, economical use of desk space, and the GE name. It has very poor battery life. I say this as the previous owner of a Panasonic which died before two years. This battery stays juiced for about a fifty minute call or a day off the base. Then it will beep loudly to signal low battery. It is not easy to find batteries and they run about 15 to 20 dollars. Since I have only had the phone one year, that seems like a big chunk of change to put out for a phone I paid about forty dollars for."
2,Not worth the money,"I thought this phone was a safe bet, I spent a little more than usual as most cordless phones I have had are poor quality. The reviews seemed decent, but I am disappointed in this phone. The sound quality is ok, not great, often some static. The handset doesn't seem to quite fit right on the base and seems to charge off and on meaning that the battery life is not great and I cant have a very long conversation. The speaker button is a stupid design, when you want to switch back to normal and press the speaker button again it hangs the phone up! Generally not a good phone for the money. Plus side, it does look quite good and comes with an answering system that works well, and the whole thing is compact. I think I am done with cordless phones and might return to one that may have a cord, but actually works well."
2,Another Pain in the Neck Phone,"BFD. It works but if you're looking for a magic phone, forget it. I wanted a phone like my old Sony that had a nice contact storage but this thing doesn't have that."
1,Don't try to phone home on this lousy phone. . .,"If you want a phone that will last longer than 90 days, don't waste your money on this piece of technological garbage. I've had my phone less than two months and the battery is already completely dead. I might as well have taken my money and set fire to it in a parking lot. I will never again purchase another GE phone. It's a good thing their light bulbs work better than their phones. . ."
5,digital phone,I am very pleased with this digital phone . The quality is excellent and there are many additional features. It is not difficult to use and suits my needs very well.
3,It's OK...,"It's fine. Voice for answering system sounds a little cheesy/desperate. After trying unsuccessfully to find the information, I was disappointed to discover that I could not use the 28021 handset I already owned with this new phone as a bedroom phone. (Maybe if I plugged it into the bedroom jack, which no longer works...)"
2,So loud!,"These shoes are the squeakiest shoes I've ever seen, mine or otherwise! They are embarrasing to wear because they are so loud. I would not recommend."
5,Mmmmmmmm,"My brother had a very satisfyingly chocolate birthday across country. If I had shipped a cake, it would've gotten stuck to the box. I'm a happy customer and so is he!!"
1,Beware of these boxed old candy bars.,"Buyer beware:Mars company collects up these stale, old candy bar returns left over from vending machines and store shelves, then repackages them in these boxes. The Twix cookies were so soft. no crunch to them, they bent over like a Gumby toy, the snickers have no flavor to them,3 musketeers chocolate coating was cracked and fell off all over the place! Do not be fooled by the cheap bargain price for 30 pieces, there needs to be expiration dates on boxes and individual wrappers, which there is not, so big box stores can keep them on shelves longer. Don't waste your money!"
2,Little pricey,Really not a very good deal. Walmart has a similar pack of 25 candy bars for only $13.Very strange to see such a poor price on Amazon.
4,excellent,"got here in time for Christmas, fast shipping, product in great condition, a little over priced"
1,unhappy,This Product came with outter plastic cover removed with only 29 bars of candy in a 30 bar pack. Also came melted and reharded. (Not sure if that happend in shipping or came that way) But unsure of eating cause package came opened. *I did not make any claim since it was so cheap.
3,could have been fresher,PURCHASED THIS MULTI-PACK FOR THE VARIETY AND PRICE RECEIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER ONCE OPENED FOUND PRODUCT TO BE LESS THAN FRESH BARS WERE BROKEN AND TASTED STALE AS IF ON SHELF FOR SOME TIME WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS FROM AMAZON SELLERS WHICH FOR THE MOST PART HAVE GIVEN ME GOOD SERVICE
1,Never again from this buyer,Run from this seller..poor service..the product is not a 30count variety after she gets your money she will email you and tell you its an 18 count box..The order will arrive damaged as no peanuts or bubble wrap is used in her box..Just a disaster transaction with this particular seller.Never again from this buyer...If there is another seller available use them.not worth saving a few pennies..RUN!!!
2,Quick delivery but product is defective,"Ordered these items for trick or treat, which is tomorrow. The package arrived quickly so it has been resting on my dining room table for a week or so, but in opening the package just now, several of the chocolate bars seemed misshaped. Upon opening one, it is obvious these bars were heated up and melted. Not even sure if I can hand them out. What a disappointment."
5,CAME IN ON TIME!,"CAME IN ON TIME FOR MY BROTHER'S BIRTHDAY ,AS I KNOW HE LOVES SNICKERS ! I GOT THESE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY ! I RECOMMEND THEM , GET THEM , FOR A GIFT OR YOURSELF !"
5,candy,"I love it! If I would have went to the grocery store and purchased 30 candy bars, that would have been almost $30.00, as the candy bars are from .85-$1.00."
4,outlandos awesome,I love the raw energy of this album. It gets you up and moving right away. It doesn't waste any time. Stewart Copelands beat from the beginning of Next To You has you going and keeps you there. I can't believe someone has the nerve to say that some of the tracks are fillers.
4,It's the Police,"The punk band who wasn't punk!? I have always enjoyed the pop sound and reggae influenced POLICE. Andy Summers plays the lush yet sparse intelligent guitar and Stewart Copeland really keeps a tight beat with enlighted genious. Sting... he's just... okay good vocal quality, okay bass, somewhat innovative. Okay Sting is a better bass player than guitar player (his love nowadays) but he's a dabbler... he dabbles in this and that, almost like he's creative but in a junkish sort of way. The other two components of POLICE (Summers and Copeland) really shine all the time."
5,An absolute MUST-HAVE,"I'm not going to read the other zillion reviews before I post, so forgive me if I say anything that has already been said.Outlandos might be the most overlooked Police release by casual listeners. Whatever it lacks in production technique it MORE than makes up in raw feeling and energy. Fans who stick to ""greatest hits"" releases are going to miss out. Most albums/cd's have highlights and low points, but this CD like many Police releases is one you just have to play straight through...over and over.If you lived through this time and bought it back in the day, then you are probably already aware of how important a release this was. If not, I suggest you put this CD in your car and listen to it over and over. Better yet, put it in your CD player at home because some of these songs make your feet just HAVE TO move which is not so good when driving."
4,"""Your brother's gonna kill me, and he's six feet ten.""","This is what The Police would sound like if you got them to play in your garage. Outlandos D'Amour is like taking a snowshoe upside the head, while Copeland, Summers, the other guy laugh at you. A hoot dang."
4,The Outlaws of Love!,"Stuart Copelands brainchild was never more raw or edgy than with their first release! From the beginning, the trio rips through some of my still all time favorite songs! Rave ups like So Lonely, Next to You, tongue in cheek classics like Can't Stand Losing You & Peanuts, and even the slower Roxanne all showcase the talent of Stuart, Gordon, and Andy, giving us a hint of things to come! An incredible CD, but only 4 stars because with Synchronisity we can see the boys real potential!"
5,Classic Album,"This is a critical album for any rock/pop music fan for several reasons. Firstly, It introduces us to The Police and Sting. Secondly, the work on this disc successfully fuses rock and pop with reggae, ska and punk influences to make an album that stands the test of time. The Police were able to pull off this ""fusion"" with a creativity and energy that is still palatable as I listen to this album years after its release.All the songs are well crafted and clever. And (despite massive overplay) who can forget the way their ears perked up when they first heard ""Roxanne"". Every song on this album is that good. Buy this; listen to a few times. You'll sing along with every song."
5,Raw and Rocking: The Poilce at their best,"""Every Breath you Take"" was the biggest Police song, but lets take a trip back to when the Police wern't pop. I'm talking about this album which reminds everyone how the Police got to be so big. Every song is listinable to the avid rocker (the last two songs; ""Won't You be My Girl(Sally) and ""Masako Tango"" are strictly hardcore). Their punk roots really shine on ""Next To You"", ""Truth Hits Everybody"", and ""Born in the Fifties"". ""Roxanne"", which is overated but a good song, remains the biggest hit on this album. Outlandos's best songs have to be ""So Lonely"" and ""Can't Stand Losing You"". Outlandos d'Amour and Regatta d' Blanc still remian to be the best Police albums. This is punk rocking Police that never could be beaten on later albums."
4,Punk on the outside - Genius in the middle,"Riding into town on a punk/reggae/rock horse, the Police turned the musical world briefly on its ear, bringing together the outstanding talents of three great musicians for a musical run that would rock around the world!It all starts here, a testimony to the influences of music! A very stong debut!"
3,EARLY ROCK REGGAE OUTING,"This debut album by The Police is interesting although the songs are of varying quality. The best tracks include the melodic reggae-influenced numbers Can't Stand Losing You, an emotionally gripping song about suicide, the hit Roxanne, about a lover that turns to prostitution, and So Lonely. The rythmic textures here are a novel blend of rock and reggae and these songs have tuneful hooks. Tracks like Truth Hits Everybody and Next To You are energetic rockers, whilst Masoko Tango has a more experimental feel with world music influences. This debut definitely made The Police stand out in 1978 and became a cult classic. Outlandos as a whole isn't consistently satisfying although it certainly shows the promise that would later make them one of the most popular bands of the 1980s."
3,popular?,"It was plain that JM wanted WTRF to reverse the tide of popular opinions about her music up to that point. Despite her famous aversion to touring, she commenced a world tour to promote this album in 82. The negative reception of 'Mingus' was plaguing her mind.Even in a bind, JM wouldnt capitulate to conventional tastes, she couldnt and didnt. However, in an album featuring guset vocals by the then pop king Lional Ritchie, and a half-hearted attempt at reinterpreting a minor rock and roll classic ('You're so Square' by Elvis Presley), one senses a subtle wavering in JM's ideals.There are tunes of real beauty. 'Chinese Cafe/Unchained Melody' is fabled to be written after a meeting between JM and Carole King after years of separation. The last track I Corinthian is an idealistic and affecting look at love from the point of view of the gospel.Newcomers to JM's music to look elsewhere. This doeant represent JM's best."
4,wild things run fast,"A good Joni Mitchell Album. Joni may not have hit the pop charts on all these songs. Chinese cafe is good, but Ladies Man and Man to Man, do what Joni is good at....relating to our life experiences and putting them down so eloquently. That teaches us and helps us to remember what is important."
4,Helpful,"This is helpful for studying Kanji, but some of the mnemonic devices are not helpful at all and can't be used.The format is easy to read and the kanji are organized by Japanese grade level, which is helpful.It would be better if the example words were written in hiragana and/or katakana instead of romaji, as I feel that it would help more.Overall, it's a pretty helpful book to have around for references to kanji."
2,Interesting history but not helpful for learning,"Henshall's book has a lot of interesting etymological information on kanji, but in terms of its usefulness for memorizing them...I would have to say there is very little. I've found that his mnemonics are weighty and in the end mnemonics teach you nothing about how kanji work, i.e. how radicals combine, how kanji work in compounds, etc. If you are interested in learning about etymology then I suggest you buy this book as well as Cecilia Lindqvist's ""China: Empire of Living Symbols,"" but if you want to acquire kanji then buy a kanji dictionary and several thousand sheets of paper because you are going to need them."
3,A LOT of superfluous info....,"This book is obviously very well-researched and thorough -- it covers all the essential 1,945 kanji, but I found the mnemonics rather annoyingly pedantic and the background information generally unnecessary. Every kanji has a paragraph of scholarly data about the primitive protoforms and etymological arguments.Perhaps interesting to some; of little practical use to me."
5,An excellent book - even if you don't want to learn kanji!,"This book was excellent. The book describes about 2000 kanji (the picture words used in Japan). It was fascinating to read about each kanji, and how it came into being. Even if one does not want to necessarily learn to read or write kanji, the history alone is very fascinating!An excellent resource guide. It is ""Totemo Omoshiroi""!"
2,"Interesting, but there are better for learning","This book is very interesting if you want to understand the origin of the Japanese characters. If you want to remember how to write them, it is very poor. There are no stroke order diagrams, and the mnemonics are too weak to remember 2000 characters. If you want a guide to remembering how to write the kanji, get Heisig's book. That really works."
2,A thorough list but fails in a few ways.,"Henshall's book is comprehensive. It is organized in chapters corresponding to the grades Japanese youngsters learn kanji. I initially chose this book over a few others because he explores kanji origins and it's kind of enlightening. But the book fails in a few major ways. First, the book does not demonstrate stroke order. The mnemonics given are pretty corny and rarely helpful. I appreciate what the author is trying to do, but for most learners, a book of mnemonics defeats the purpose. Finally, the calligraphy is terrible and many old-form kanjis and kanjis embedded in English text are hand-written. It's pretty sloppy. The major selling point of the book is the English-language history of kanji origins, though I would imagine that if you are really concerned about kanji origins, you are probably a specialist and can read Japanese documents on the subject. I recommend ""Kanji & Kana"" over this one."
4,It's a Study Aid NOT a Textbook,"There seems to a lot of mis-information about this book.This is an excellent book, but it is not a kanji dictionary nor is it a kanji text book. It does not have stroke order, it only has a couple of (useless) words for each kanji, and tends to over look kun readings.This book should be used in conjunction with a proper kanji text book. It should only be on your bookshelf after you have a kanji text and dictionary.4 stars for what it is, an aid."
3,It all depends on how you memorize things.,"I bought this book when I first started studying Japanese, and it was very interesting, but at the same time, I didn't learn that much from it other than the history of the characters.This book doesn't show you stroke orders, and it uses roma-ji instead of kana. It also takes time to look up the other characters that are contained in compunds. You have to look them up in the index in the back of the book. It would be a lot better if they just had the numbers of the Kanji next to the compounds.Some of my friends like the way it helps you memorize Kanji by including mnemonics, and some of them do help, but a lot of them are a little bit too complex, and it is easier to go ahead and memorize the Kanji instead of the mnemonic."
1,Kanji primer for Brett,"Yes, my aging bachelor, they are called the gakushuu kanji. However, if we turn to Daijirin (2nd Edition), we find:-ñ \ y¿z`-ÌúÉ""`àÉéÉw""é*K-véÄé¿Ì'ÌB`RcA1948""Ni~a23jÉu""--p¿**\vÄ""""`I'èBÌwKw""-v-ÌÌü'ùÉ""ÁÄ77""NÉ~ZÉA89""NÉZZ~ZÈÁBSee also [...]Please explain the difference between the kyouiku kanji and gakushuu kanji, which seems to exist only in your rather roomy cranium. As the terms are synonymous, you may have a bit of difficulty with this task."
5,24 hours = 15 more kanji known.,"I've owned this book for just one day and I already know 15 more kanji. This is everything I could have hoped for! I saw a few of Henshall's kanji etymologies on Joyo96.org, and I had to get the book. I find etymology not only fascinating but very useful in remembering new words and where they came from and what they relate to. The same goes for kanji; knowing why a kanji is written the way it is helps me remember it. Each part of each kanji is explained. Having the kanji written in brushstroke and typed for also helps in recognizing them and writing them. If anyone has any interest in the origins of kanji, this is the book to buy."
2,Department of What ever the hell we feel like,"***BE ADVISED***This title although by the Department of transport - has many errors found in definitions of signs -For example - On a motorway the electronic wicket signs in the central reservation is a Temporary mandatory speed limit - says the Highway codeThis book states that it is a ""Temporary maximum advisory speed limit"" - the key word there advisery - this is simply not the case it is mandatory!If you are getting this book for very important exams - i.e Ambulance driver taining or Police driving - Including Advanced motorist association driving (IAM etc), recommend you learn the highway code - better and correct!"
1,I paid for quicker post but I did not receive yet.,"Unfortunately, I paid for quicker post but I did not receive yet (1 month). It was said (advised) to check the custom house of my country, but I really did not have time to do it yet. I've been busy and I did not receive any letter of the custom house, what they generally do when they want us to take the product with them. Difficult situation, poor options of solution offered by the seller. I just want to receive the book that I paid to receive!"

3,A metaphysical appreciation of the life of the Virgin Mary,"The author is a minister with the Church of Religious Science, and in this book she collects legends about Mother Mary ""designed to engage the reader in the Spiritual and Mystical aspects of the life of the Mother Mary. This book is about Mary. However, it is not intended to overshadow her son, the Christos whom she brought into incarnation on this earth. She was his most learned student, steadfast supporter and loyal to the end. Her life on earth was centered in serving God. In the desert country of Palenstine was born the highest Master ever to occupy a female body: Mary, the perfected woman, mother-to-be of the Christos ..."" Includes 8 glossy pages of art illustrations.According to their website, Fish Rock Publishing began ""as a vanity press to publish independent writers of New Thought."" Not my own cup of tea, but may appeal to metaphysicians and those interested in stories and legends about Mary."
4,Pretty Good Bang For Your Buck,Glutamine is an underrated supplement. This is better than Creatine because it focuses on muscle repair.
1,"one order lost, the other order wrong!","I made two seperate orders from this company (not amazon). One order was to be sent to me the other to my parents. The order to be sent to me was delivered, sort of. Wrong pills (although they did send out the correct ones and made that order right). The 2nd order was to be sent to my parents. After several attempts to get this company to deliver, I had to apply for a refund through Amazon. I will not be ordering from this company again and I highly suggest readers of this review not bother."
2,three orders from different soursces,I have ordered from amazon in the past I ordered 3 books from different sources and have never waited as long as I did with these 3 orders maybe it was due to Christmas mail. I am not sure but will be hesistant to order again.
2,Disappointing...,"I was looking for a comfortable, well made thong. It was not comfortable at all... and was more skimpy than it seemed in the photo. If you have any sort of a tummy... I suggest skipping this one."
2,bad coverage,"I tried these because I love the body lace camisole, but the crotch coverage is just too small and doesn't do the trick."
4,searching for herself,"The Serpentine Cave is a beautifully written story about a middle aged woman's search for her unknown father. Set in Cornwall, this novel evokes the spirit of this special region of England, and is a lovely study of a woman's search for her self in the context of her own past and that of her homeland.Jill Paton Walsh is a gifted writer. Also recommended is A Parcel of Patterns, which centers upon the plague village of Eyem."
5,"Heartbreaking, heartwarming!","Few people understand a woman's emotional need to conceive, carry and nurse a child of her own. And even fewer understand the emotional turmoil that committed couples endure when they discover they cannot conceive. Fewer yet understand the mental anguish (and physical pain for the woman) that the couple faces as they contend with a mirage of tests, procedures and failed attempts to reproduce. ""Empty Arms: A Heavy Load to Carry"" by Dorothy Donham is a both a heartbreaking and heartwarming saga of one couple's struggle with infertility. The author bears her soul through a collection of journal entries to expose infertility on a personal basis. Have a full box of Kleenex on hand when you read this book, especially the final pages!"
4,My Third Favorite!,This is my third favorite of the Lemony Snicket book that have come out! Its very good and all of the Baudelaires are very clever and stop at nothing to capture Count Olaf. They are probably the most resourcful and quick in situations as I have ever seen them. Don't expect to be puting it down!
4,Live by beautiful leech infested Lake Lachrymose,"LACHRYMOSE REAL ESTATE SALES, INC.FOR SALE: A damp, dark, smelly caveHere is your chance to own a beautiful cave on Lake Lachrymose! One of the few lakes in the world large enough to have its own hurricane. The Baudelaire orphans lived here with their aunt Josephine, in a fine cottage tentatively perched on the edge of a tall cliff overlooking the lake. Josephine was afraid of the leeches, as she was afraid of nearly everything else. She spent some time in this beautiful, damp cave as a prisoner of Count Olaf, who had disguised himself as a peglegged sailor and opened a boat rental shop as a cover. The Baudelaire orphans even visited this cave, in an attempt to rescue their frightened aunt. We can nearly gaurantee you'll have an even better time than the Baudelaire's had if you purchase this out of the way piece of property, where you're nearly assured that you won't be bothered."
4,the best book ever,"this is the best book i have ever read so far. i read other books by lemony snicket before but this book is her best. lemony snicket made me enjoy reading. before i read her books i would think, what is the point of reading? she puts you in a hole that sucks you in to a diffrent world when you are reading.if you havent read this book and are used to books that are happy this book goes the opposite way. the book is about three charactors named violet, klaus, and sunny.these three children lost there parents in a house fire. durring when the house was burning they were playing at the beach if you think that is sad you should turn back and read a diffrent book. there is much more sad events in the book.you should read this book unless you are verry emotional."
1,The Tim Curry audio cds are so much better!,"My children and I love these books, and -- after reading all 11-- bought the audio cds. The first two audio cds, with Tim Curry as the narrator, were mesmerizing. This one, with Daniel Handler reading the book, was very disappointing. In fact, the children quickly lost interest and we turned it off. Handler is a wonderful and extraordinary writer, but he should leave the reading of his books on audio cd to professional actors like Tim Curry."
2,Narration is the problem,"The first two audio books, The Bad Beginning and The Reptile Room, were narrated by the actor Tim Curry. He did a good job with reading the text. This third installment was narrated by the author. I couldn't get through the book because I don't like how he read it. It was a bit monotone and a bit irritating. I have no doubt the book is good, but they should have hired an actor for the narration. But maybe it wouldn't bother you."
4,The Unfortunate Events become Fortunate,"""The Wide Window"" by Lemony Snicket was a very interesting book. When I first picked up the book I didn't think it was going to be that good, but then I started to read, it surprised me how attached to it I was. It all starts out with the Baudelaire children waiting once again for their new guardian come to pick them up. After their parents death from a terrible fire they go from house to house, while having Count Olaf chasing after their fortune. Count Olaf makes the lives of the Bauldelaire children very difficult to live. They currently live with their Aunt Josephine who is terrified of everything. What challenges will the children face this time? You will have to read it to find out."
5,Great!,"This was a great book!The three kids go to another guardian: Aunt Josephine. She's a good guardian, but somewhat fickle. She's obsessed with grammar and corrects the kids at every moment. She's afriad of everything that is really ridiculous which doesn't make sense because of where she lives. Her house is on the edge of a cliff that overlooks a huge lake that's big enough to have hurricanes. Her house is only attached to the cliff by a few boards. Of course, Count Olaf comes and makes things awful in one of his unconvincing disguises..."
3,"Won't You Come Home, Tim Curry?","I have been enjoying the ""Series of Unfortunate Events"" stories on CD during my long commutes. The stress brought on by reckless and inconsiderate drivers is somehow lessened when I think of the troubles faced by the Baudelaire children. But...I have found the sound quality and consistency of the recordings by Lemony Snicket himself (as compared to the early recordings done by Tim Curry) to be less than satisfactory. It's rather like eating cold parsnip soup with vinegar on a chilly, rainy day. It's just not what one would expect.In this recording, the reader uses VOLUME rather than voice modulation to differentiate between characters. The problem is that some parts of the story are almost impossible to hear, so one turns up the volume. Then the reader switches to a character voice that is EXTREMELY LOUD AND STARTLING to the listener. It really is a distraction from the stories. I'm on Book the Fifth now, but I may not be able to continue..."
5,Creative Book,This book is very creative. I also think it's the best book in the series so far! I can't wait to read the next one in the series of unfortunate events.
3,A Repeated Plot,"As I read this book, I realized that I had read if before as "" The Reptile Room"". Both books have the children shipped off to distant relatives, something terrible happens to them and the evil Uncle appears. The difference was in "" The Reptile Room"" they had happy times with Uncle Monty and were about to set off on a great adventure. In ""Wide Window"" Aunt Josephine has irrational fears of everyday objects. In the end, they escape the evil Uncle as he disappears into the forest and they are shipped off to new relatives. If the""Miserable Mill"" has the same plot I am done with this series. As an adult I read children's literature to find appropriate books for a 9 yr old. This series insults his intelligence if all the plots remain the same. Rating 6"
4,"The Wide Window(A Series Of Ufortunate Events, book 3 )","I think the wide window is an exelent book! It's about threechildren, Violet, 14, Klause ,12, and Sunney, an infant. violet is a machanic, she loves to invent stuff. klause, he loves to read,any types of books. sunney,well she loves to bite. They are all brite children. they go to live with thier aunt,who is scared of everything! So I defanintly recomend this book for children."
1,"Authors should be read, not heard....","I love the Series of Unfortunate Events. I love 'The Wide Window'. I love all the audio books of this series.....THE ONES READ BY TIM CURRY!!!!Mr. Snicket is a fantastic writer. The SUE books are witty, tongue in cheek, woefully depressing and wonderfully dismal. Reading them is a treat. Listening to Mr. Snicket read them is a fate worse than being bitten by the Mamba Du Mal.Get the recordings done by Tim Curry....SCREAM & run away from the ones read by Mr. Snicket."
2,Beautifully Packaged but......,Beautifully packaged but content that's fluff. Even a 10 year old and upwards knows the lens of a spyglass focused on the light of the moon does not make fire. I think Lemony Snicket and HarperCollins should to.I don't believe my daughter will be asking for Book 4
4,9 Year old liked it,My 9 year old likes the book a lot but not as much as Harry Potter hence the 4 stars
4,"Eight year olds love the whole series, including this one.",My eight year old daughters say: it was really scary when aunt Josephine went overboard. And when the kids thought she jumped out of the window. It was really adventurous. I liked the kids always figure out a way to get out of horrible situations.
5,Good book,I am a school librarian and I needed a quick extra cppy of this book for a student. Quick delivery ( I am an Amazon Prime customer) !! Just exactly what I thought I was getting quality wise.
4,Read It!,"Another funny witty action adventure for the Baudelaire orphans. This was our favorite of the first 3 in the series. Snicket writes so well, and the books are a pleasure to read aloud. Not a 5-star because the plots are pretty far-fetched, farcical. (Not for kids under 8!)"
5,The Wide Window,"Believe it or not, this is the first Lemony Snicket book I've read. I just finished it yesterday. When I first stumbled upon these books in the library, I expected them to be gloomy and negative. They were all that...but very enjoyable, indeed. Count Olaf played the roll of a wonderful, sneaky villian! Aunt Josephine was paranoid and hilarious! The orphans were very schemeish(is that a word?) I loved Klaus's fascination with books, Violet's knack for inventing things, Sunny's taste for chewing. Mr. Poe with his oblivious nature. And Aunt Josephine, as mentioned earlier, well...she's just plain paranoid and scared! Definately recommended!"
4,The Wide Window,"The Wide WindowSome people enjoy history or happy stories. There are fantasy books and mysteries. The book The Wide Window is an adventurous mystery story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.The three Baudalaire Violet, Klaus, and Sunny have to go live with their Aunt Josephine, because Uncle Monty their last guardian passed away. But wherever they are, Count Olaf, their old guardian, is right there with them, trying to steal their fortune. Aunt Josephine writes a suicide note when she jumps out the window. Is she alive? Where is Count Olaf hiding?I really enjoyed this book because it is realistic and has a great ending. If you enjoy this book, by Lemony Snicket, you might like the Danger.com series. This is definitely a book to add to your library.By: Emily Alston"
3,Fun with words,"One of the funniest things I've ever read: ""If you are allergic to a thing, it is best not to put that thing in your mouth, especially if the thing is cats. ""Another satisfying tale."
4,The Wide Window book review by Carey Neff,"The book The Wide Window is another horrid part of the Baudilare children's life. It all starts after the three children(Violet, Claus, and Sunny) arive at there Aunt Josephine's house over Lake Lachrymose. In town they once again have an encounter with Count Olaf. This time he is discised as Captain Sham. Before I continue if you hate tragidy don't finsh reading this review, but if you can take it continue on. After Aunt Josephine misteryously disappears the children are shore Count Olaf is to blame. They then are forsted to live Count Olaf. I have not finished the book yet but I can't waint to."
3,Audio CD is a disappointment,"I really enjoy the series and thought it would be great to listen to the audio CDs on a long road trip. The 1st and 2nd books are great with Tim Curry as the narrator. After the 2nd book, the author is now also the narrator. He doesn't do as good of a job as Tim Curry. Not only that, but it was very difficult to listen to. It goes from a very soft whisper to shouting whenever he plays one of the character. I keep having to adjust the volume from level 20 down to level 15. The recording is terrible."
3,"They're good books, but...","I've read the first two books in this series too. They're funny and well written, but i don't think i'm going to read any more in the series, because they're basically all the same. Count Olaf shows up in some disguise, tries to get rid of the kids, who know its Count Olaf but no one believes them. In the end, it is Count Olaf and the kids lose everything but their lives, and the adults realize that they should have listened to the kids. But of course, in the next book they fall for it again. If you don't mind that sort of thing you should read them all, but if reapeting plots bug you, you should only read one book in this series to get the whole idea."
5,Awesome,I love this book so much it's so daring and I don't ever want to stop getting the next book!!
3,Food Allergies? Beware,"As a parent I try to read at least some of what my precocious kid is reading. I was worried that this series is really beyond him at 7. And it is. But the reason for my low rating for an otherwise fine book is the treatment of food allergies. I know, the book is supposed to be absurd, so maybe I shouldn't care more about the treatment of food allergies than I do about all the other bizarre things in the book. But I do. The kids intentionally eat peppermint to which they are allergic, in an effort to excuse themselves from a lunch with Count Olaf. So, they break out into hives and Klaus actually experiences a swollen tongue - something which could then lead to his death in real life. But here it is treated as part of the humor. Ha Ha Ha. No one can understand what Klaus says because he is attempting to talk with a swollen tongue. Probably he was saying, ""I am having a severe allergic reaction, administer my Epi Pen and get me to a hospital."""
3,Abitofaletdown,"I have some of these books on CD's and I loved the first two read by Tim Curry. I just got the 3rd and 4th, read by Lemony, and I have to say that Tim brings much more life to the stories then Lemony does. If I understood what I read correctly, Tim was working on other things and couldn't read for a few of the Lemony Snickets books, but he pick it up again in the 6th one. Thank goodness! As boring as the 3rd and 4th were, I think, if Tim were to have read for them, they would have been much more interesting. Sorry Lemony! You are a wonderful writer, but in my opinion, a character reader you are not. I love these stories and I can't wait to get the rest of the series on CD as well."
3,the wide window,I thought that this book was interesting and it made you want to read the book more as you went further into the book . i thought it was sad and happy for them to get away from count Olaf .Ithink this was an o.k book it wasn't as great as 1 and 2.but this is better than four.I think if someone would want to read this book because even though its sad I thought it was really enjoyablefor me anyways
4,The Wide Window,"The Wide Window is another great book in the Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket. This book was hard to put down because you always wanted to find out what happened next. Every chapter ended abruptly in a cliff-hanger, like when it said "" and Violet realized the answer was right in front of her."" This is a book for anyone who likes the first two books in the series."
4,The Wide Window Review,This is a very good book that has suspense in every page! The three Baudelaire children are first sent to live with the new scared guardian Aunt Josephine on Lake Lachrymose where the whole story takes place. Than they meet Captain Sham which is no dough Count Olaf with a peg leg. Captain Sham becomes friends with Aunt Josephine. Than one night she jumps out a window and leaves a note putting the children under Captain Shams care. The 3 children decipher the note steal a sail boat and sail through a hurricane to get Aunt Josephine from a cave. They think they solve the problem but when the boat starts to sink and Captain Sham pushes Aunt Josephine to her death they still have a problem. But Sunny exposes Count Olaf to Mr. Poe their problem is solved. I would recommend this book to boys and girls and people who like adventure and mystery.
5,I'm Afraid!,"""I am afraid of my house so I don't live in it"" is the kind of attitude you will find in Lemony Snicket's The Wide Window. The Baudelaire orphans live with a woman who is afraid of Realtors and not afraid of her house on the edge of a hill! Not to mention that the very lake she is afraid of is right under her house! It might sound crazy, but it's real. It also is quite funny too. But, do the orphans like her? Yes, as they get used to her ""cooking"". This book is like the other two books. It has very good hooks and misteries to find out. It is a sad filled advetnure with many more adventures ahead, icluding a wooden leg. I recomend this book for all ages. You will not regret reading this book."
1,Unfortunate Performance,"Note that this audio book is read by the author, not by Tim Curry who did such a wonderful job reading the first two books in the series. Lemony Snicket should recognize his talents and limitations and stick to writing. Lemony's writing is wonderful, his reading is very disappointing. Hopefully the publisher will re-record this book with Tim Curry or with someone else with equal vocal talents."
5,Have you lost the thrill?,"Are you sick of reading fairy stories that always end Happily Ever After? Wonder why villians try to take over the world when they must know they wont win? Here is a tale about three children who don't always win. Lots of twists, lots of fun.So far, number three is my favourite, numbers 1 and 2 set the scene, so in 3 there's more action and adventure. The books might seem repititive, but the writer is clever and funny, introducing new ideas with each book making the stories more complex and intriguing. A book adults will enjoy too!These books make you love books! As twisted and funny as Roald Dahl and Edward Gorey, as spine tingling as Agatha Cristie!"
3,The okay book.,"...BR> I think this book wasn't one of his best writings. In my opinion I think this book is one of his worse works. A lot of it isn't very realistic. The part when he said that Aunt Josephine's house built on wooden stilts on the coast of Lake Larchymore. That isn't very realistic because no one in the right mind would ever live in there.My favorite part of the story is when the Baudelaire orphans bump into Count Olaf, in disguise as Captain Sham, at the supermarket. ""She saw Count Olaf she stopped speaking, and for a second Violet thought that Aunt Josephine had recognized him too."" This part his nice because it shows the Baudelaire orphans once again is brewing up some trouble for themselves"
3,"Interesting, idealistic","I sometimes wonder if those who would like to see an end to our high tech world actually have any idea what it would be like to live without it. Sullivan presents an end-of-world scenario involving Bara, raped by White Michael, who has his son, then runs for Ireland after being ""called"" by bright and lovely images and a persuasion that she must head West to that fabled green isle.On the way, she meets various savage groups, including two who practice ritual sacrifice. Rescued in the nick, she and her male companion wind up on a ship and finally arrive, but there, she finds out just who called her and why.Worth reading, but it involves lots of telepathy (interestingly worked out) and a somewhat New Age sensibility."
2,Better off buying HU or Deer Hunter 2005!,"It isn't as if the technology isn't available either...the game just really lacks on all sides...story line is off, graphics are low tech for this day and age, and the animals move like stick figures at best! What is worse is; the game is a SUPER BAD take off of the Cabela's series! I was nearly offended for Cabela games!Best I advice I can give perspective buyers is: buy Any one of the four games of Hunting Unlimited or ANY of the Deer Hunter series games and/or Trophy Hunter games...at least you WON'T be throwing out your money!"
2,Bass Pro Shops Trophy Hunter 2007,I am not used to playing a game where I can not save the game right where I am. I have never been able to see if I can reach a point where I can save any part of the game. I don't have the time to sit and play all day to find out. Not a product for me.
2,BPS Trophy Hnter 2007,"Its an okay game. Manual needs to be more detailed, there is no clue how to operate the ATV , it can get stuck on a slight slope. I wished it had the ability to save at ANY point / ANY time in the game. Its still new to me, but it seems you can only save between hunts. In other words, one needs to complete a hunt in order to save at that point, can't seem to save at any other point."
5,Human world view of Earth,"I bought this book after reading a review in the academic journal American Anthropologist, December 2007, Vol. 109, Iss. 4; p 767-768 by F. Wyndham. This book is an excellent addition to my library. My other Ecology text is written by a Biology Professor, R. Ricklefs, so this Anthropolgy text gives a Social Science perspective on the environment. It was a positive review in American Anthropologist."
4,My favorite xmas special,"I watched it every year when I was little, and frankly, I didn't think that the moral of the story was about getting presents. It's about believing, taking responsibility for your actions, and working together for a common goal. It wasn't the prospect of no presents that upset the townsfolk, it was that Santa thought that none of them believed in him. And, like in the Grinch, the townsfolk still gathered together to sing xmas carols at the stroke of midnight, despite the prospect of no presents."
5,"Come on ol' Kris Kringle, down the milky way...","This was one of my favorite children's holiday specials as a child, the darling cartoon characters, the sweet voices, the excellent plot, the charming songs, I love everything about it. I'm so glad it's on VHS so we can watch is as often as we like during the holidays, I just wish it were available in DVD!The songs are infectious--you'll be humming them the whole month of December. The ""Bells are calling Santa"" song enchanted me as a child. I look forward to intiating my daughter into it's joys and making it a special holiday event over the years.I love this style of cartoon, I enjoyed the Rankin/Bass production of The Hobbit and The Last Unicorn just as much. Wish they'd made more..."
5,Long lost favorite Christmas Special,"The likeable characters and highly stylized animation, combined with memories of this from my youth make this a holiday favorite. I thought it was gone forever, because it's never on TV. Okay, bye."
5,Serengeti Drivers Lenses Are the Best,"These sunglasses are very high quality. In particular, the Serengeti Drivers lenses are still second to none. Driving glare control is excellent while visibility remains high at all times. The frames are stylish, sturdy and fit very well. The sunglasses stay firmly in place, even while exercising.My last pair of Serengeti's lasted for 10 years before I finally got a small scratch on one of the lenses. Hopefully, I will get another 10 years wear from the new ones as well."
4,If you should buy 2 CDs this year...,"If you should buy 2 CDs this year, make this your second choice. If you have to buy 1 CD this year, but A1's ""The A List"" CD. This CD is A1's first CD and it's a good CD. It has a few VERY GOOD slow ballads on there that you really can't pass up if you like A1. I first heard their song ""No More"" on an mp3 from their second album and thought it was really great. Then I started to slowly hear more of their songs and this is a really good band. All the boys can sing and their music is just soothing to the ears. So, what the hay, give this CD a try. You only live once and I don't think you should pass up A1. Thanks!"
5,Excellent,I recommend this version because Mayr must be well known. He was master of Donizzetti. It's a good job from Naxos rescue from forgetfulness autors and pieces like this.
2,Cut my child's face...,"First of all, this toy is an excellent reproduction of the bad guys from the original Gumby show.However, the material used on the heads of the blockheads is not very soft and the edges actually cut my 6 year old's cheek.It has just enough edge that if you are swinging it around in the air or throw it, it can cut your skin.It's basically the only option if you want to buy the blockheads, but they should make it out of softer material or slightly round off the edges on the heads."
4,I was intrigued,"The Hidden GodContrary to another reviewer, I was not disappointed by this book. It takes an unusual angle into the subject of film and struggling faith, and although it doesn't say the last word on any of the fifty films chosen, it starts one thinking on new lines. The directors included are world leaders of cinema. While a few of the brief, four-page treatments are worthless, many are erudite and insightful. Try it!"
1,"A sad, sad book",This book is not even up to the level of smear. It is a shame that people could write such trash and make money off of smearing a good and honest man. Please do not wast your money and reward these political hacks.
5,Not a right wing smear,"Far from being a right-wing NRA-loving yellow journalist smear of Al Gore as claimed in another review, the primary author of this book is a radical leftist who writes a column for The Nation and has been a Village Voice contributor.Look at the other books he has written, and perhaps do a web search for more information about him before deciding this book is right-wing fiction. I think it is all the more telling that prominent journalists of the LEFT such as Mr Cockburn and Christopher Hitchens have written such damning books about Clinton and Gore.While being somewhat irrelevant given the results of the election, [it is a good buy] for someone who wants to understand the dirty reality behind the fictional images we are presented of leading politicians in the mass media (ie TV)."
4,Fun Computer Games,"I purchased these games a year ago, and my family uses them all the time- except Sorry!, which does not work on our computer. It is scrambled. We even received a replacement CD from the company, thinking there was something wrong with our CD- and the replacement did the same thing. Other than that one game, the rest work great and are a lot of fun."
2,Needs Updating,The book is out-of-date and really not very funny. I expected more from P.J. O'Rourke but I will not expect anything from him in the future. He's actually a 1980's king of guy.
3,Just Ok,"Worth the read to get the flavor of our political establishment, a bit too over written to achieve humor though."
5,Outstanding and right on,"If he were not so dead-on accurate about most parts of our government this book would be even funnier. Although it is now a bit dated this remains a 'must read' in my mind. The section on the Agriculture Department alone is worth the price of the book. If nothing else, buy it to read the closing section of the book in which he brings home the truth - in a democracy we get the government that we ask for."
5,humous,"P.J. O'Rourke does it again by using his life as a journalist to uncover the american political system looking at things like special interests, foreign policy, presidential campaigns and congress. The book is insightful and fun to read."
1,Parliament of Whores,"This book is not at all funny. I didn't laugh a single time while reading it. The author is nothing more than a closeted anarchist that doesn't understand how reality works. He himself is everything that he accuses the government of being; hypocritical, greedy, stupid. He goes on and on about how the government wastes the tax payers money and how it is constantly seeking more and more of our hard earned dollars and then goes on to talk about how he doesn't want HIS money to fund Social Security or to go to anything that would help any special interest groups. Dave Barry is a humorist, this man is a moron."
4,US Politics,"For the non US citizen, a great insight to the workings of the US political machine. PJ O'Rourk' cynical humour educates and entertains"
4,Parliament of Whores,"O'Rourke, as usual, has a healthy disrespect for his subject. Although written over 10 years ago, his observations still apply."
2,Not what I thought,"This game is not what I thought it would be. I was looking for the standard Las Vegas solitaire and even though this game has lots of different versions of card games, I haven't found the game I wanted yet. The instructions for each game are a little vague also."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I should have known better than to buy this movie. I happened to stumble upon it and, being my family loves wrestling, I picked it up for Christmas. It said it had Rey Mysterio (Sr.) in it. I should have stopped right there, knowing it wasn't Rey Mysterio Jr. This movie wasn't scary at all. It looked like it took all of $5 to make. There's really not much more I can say about it. Don't buy it."
3,Could have been better,"I'm hoping there's a sequal to this since they left it open for one. I hope the sequal is better too. Thing is, most of the action is blocked out. Instead of seeing the actual killing, most of the time you just hear the grunts and screams. I too bought this thinking that it was Rey Misterio. Then, I thought it was his dad only to learn that his uncle had the name. Cool cool. Anyways, this movie is sort of Wrestling meets the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Very poorly done, most of the plot doesn't really make sense. I'm just sayin it was ok. I didn't hate it nor did I really like it. This movie definately could have been done better. And the time on it isn't very long. Needs to be lengthy.I say, buy this movie if you are collecting movies of wrestlers. Otherwise, I'd just rent it."
4,Cool movie!,"This was a neat and different film. In short, a group of kids head to Mexico, only to find themselves stranded in a town that is home to a ""wrestlemaniac"", a guy who was a legendary mexican wrestler (mask and all), but who has since gone a bit nuts. I absolutely hate professional wrestling, and will categorically dismiss anyone who thinks its interesting. That notwithstanding, this movie was fun. The kids work their way through the mostly abandoned town, and slowly get picked off by the wrestler guy. They slowly come to realize what they need to do to defend against him, and its somewhat interesting how they do so. The acting was mostly very good (not oscar, but certainly not so bad you notice), and the production quality was quite high as well. I enjoyed and highly recommend."
3,decent movie,The movie was okay. It could have been better. Rey Mysterios character did a good job. It took to long before I saw him.
5,"Brilliant, Deep","I'm a psychologist, and especially enjoy books with psychological content. This book provides remarkable insight into psychoanalytic thought and human complexity and fallibility. It's interesting and a good read, actually quite exciting at some points. I loved it!"
3,Disproportionate efforts.,"I found the groundwork-laying portion of the novel to be overly long, with insufficient compelling reading, up until almost the half way part of the book. My favorite parts in the second half were too short and quick to conclude. Many nights of casual reading at start, followed by hungry reading marathon at end. Strong technique and good background research. Careful about who I reccommend this book too."
4,A psychiatrist takes on evil.,This is certainly not the best book of all time but it is very good. Yglesias has written an engrossing story about a psychiatrist with a lurid past who loses a patient to suicide. The patients murders his own wife before he kills himself. Dr. Neruda begins an obsessive quest of revenge that ultimately shows him succumbing to the very evil he opposes
3,"Good compared to VHS, not much difference from the DVD version.","Unless you're upgrading it from VHS then don't worry about buying a blu-ray version if you already have the DVD.Having watched the original DragonballZ on DVDs and despite their best attempts at restoring the original films, the blu-ray version doesn't seem to offer any real advantage to the DVD versions.You will still notice the film grain throughout the film.Another issue is given that the original version was made for 4:3 the up scaling to 16:9 didn't really do anything for the film and feels like a cropped/stretched version of the original.The storyline itself is fine as I am a huge fan of the series and for the price on Amazon it was a good deal which is why it got a 3 out of 5 instead of a 2 out of 5."
4,Great Action for DBZ,This is a great anime of Frieza's brother. His name is Coola and not Cooler. This is pretty good anime and the english version isn't that bad like in other DBZ movies.
2,Absolute load of rubbish,If you believe this load of rubbish you'll believe in anything; especially written by this person whom some would describe as 'a very ordinary opportunist' as opposed to anything else in medical or literacy circles. It even shows in the way it has tried to be writtenThe actual written content is very amateurish to say the least and quite frankly you would be better off reading Disneyland books for children which would make more sense and help out your health woes. Save your money and buy an ice-cream or tenjohno
4,This was pretty good,It would have been difficult to surpass the greatness of TIMEOUT-which must be the greatest cd EVER. But this one is pretty good.
3,Main show - ok. Extra episodes - just repeats,"The Jimmy / Timmy Power Hour 2 was decent. Definitely not as good as the first one, but it is worth watching. The extra episodes of The Fairly OddParents are all pretty much repeats of epidsodes that have already been released on other DVDs. If they are going to release additional episodes, it would be nice if they were episodes that weren't already available.Not a bad purchase, but I can't help thinking it is a bit of a rip off."
1,not so great,I got this for my dad. It was hard to set the time. The voice was not loud enough for him to hear. It stopped talking shortly after purchase. Dumb
1,"need to return, not working","Bought the watch for my 90 year old mother, I was out of town for 3 weeks, per my conversation with my mother, the watch has not worked from the time it arived.Need to return."
5,Just what I needed,"I really needed a manual for our 4-wheeler and I found it.Still sealed. Brand new, excellant shape. Great price !!!!!"
5,Best Book Ever,This is a must have for any tarantula owner. I had recently bought two spiderlings and needed some firsthand knowledge that this book provided. A must have.
5,Perfect! Exactly What I Wanted :-D,"The Tarantula Keeper's Guide is exactly what I was looking for. Lots and lots of information ranging from basic care to tarantula history and specific species care. This should be the first book anyone new to tarantula keeping should pick up, it will become your go to manual for tarantula care. I highly recommend you check it out!"
4,Darn good book,"""The Tarantula Keeper's Guide"" is a very worthwile purchase. Lots of info on keeping , breeding, trouble shooting and an excellent section on collecting wild ""T""'s. The only thing that keeps this tome from being a GREAT book is the lack of pictures. If you are looking for a book with lots of color glossies of different species, this book will break your heart. While there are some color pics ( and b/w drawings ) a book of this size and scope should have many, many more. Other then that , this book is well worth buying as it is an excellent refrence book, especialy at Amazon's low price !"
3,Good Book,"For everyone who is interested in getting into the hobby you will find that this book is reccomended above all others. So why am I giving it a 3 star rating? It's wordy and lengthy and might not appeal to the novice who wants straight to the point information on the raising and caring of spiderlings and tarantulas. It sometimes drags on and repeats information that it has stated in other chapters. I wish it had better photographic examples of housing, raising, products. It does offer good historical information on the origin of the tarantula and is still a good book to have in your library."
1,SACD Need I say more???,"Yep!!! It can't be played on a computer. It can't be ripped to Mp3 and loaded onto an Mp3 player. It doesn't reside on my hard drive along with ""Naked II"" and ""The Naked Truth"" nor can I listen to it using Winamp through my Creative Sound Blaster USB sound card via my Logitech 5.1 THX Certified, Dolby Digital, DTS surround sound speakers. The only way to rip it is via a stand alone CD player through an audio out to the computers audio in then I'd have to create Mp3 tags for each song. What a pain, so I haven't bothered. I could buy the Mp3's, but not at the bit rates I rip at. Live and learn I guess. I'll remember to look for SACD from now on and avoid purchasing anything so labeled."
1,Incorrect storage conditions,"I bought these vitamins for the second time. The first time, everything was normal. Now came the packaging in which tablets are very different from those who came for the first time. They did not have a fresh new look and color of those pills that have to be white - brown. Possibly due to incorrect storage conditions. Please return the money back or send a new box of Animal Pack."
5,Great for staying healthy,"I do lift weights but I use these more as a general multivitamin. Yes it's probably overkill, but I can honestly say that in the years I've used it, I've not gotten sick as often or as severly. That alone is worth the per packet cost. I use 1 pack a day in the morning and I know I'm all set on my vitamin and mineral needs."
5,best vitamins,it may be to many pills for some people but i believe this is seriously the best multi out there!!!
5,Great Vitamins!,"Universal Animal Pak, come in small plastic bag of 11 pills of various sizes some rather large and could be difficult to sallow. The pack is considered more of a vitamin pack than a body building pack there are others to consider if you are looking for gains.I only work out 3 days a week and take 2 packs a day on those days while working out and the rest of the week I take one pack. My energy levels and overall mode are improved after taking this product. I have never felt an energy boost after taking vitamins but with this product I was amazing that I could feel the boost, while it was not a great boost it was enough to keep me motivated and feeling positive throughout the day.I also have not gotten sick since taking this pack, I mean I have not been sick at all. I used to get the common cold every winter but not anymore. I actually when and setup Amazon's subscribe and save to get this deliver every 2 months after buying one and feeling the effects."
5,great,"While the pills are huge so are its amazing effects! Second to none is Animal Pak. All the vitamins you need to support muscle growth are contained in one simple package to help eliminate buying multiple products and going through several bottles, hoping to remember them all. Its a great buy and essential for any level builder/lifter."
5,Faithful buyer of Animal Pak...,"I used to get sick... pretty often. I had 3 colds in one year that turned into bronchitis. I started taking these since it seemed my immune system was just not doing so well... 1 year later, I still have not gotten sick ONCE. I take a pack once a day and will continue to do so until they stop making these... Granted, it's not fun taking so many pills. But it's well worth it to stay healthy."
4,Good Product,"Animal Pak shipped here in decent time and the product itself is great. I am not so sure it doesn't add to your testosterone and sex drive. Cause I was completely exhausted before I got a new multivitamin, then I got this and this product is real good. If your serious about working out and not scared to swallow big pills then by all means you should buy this product."
5,Great! but hard to swallow,"I agree with the previous review, they are very high quality vitamins but very difficult to swallow. I have to grind them in a coffee bean blender and then add them to a whey protien shake, seems works very well."
3,The pills ARE big no complaining but their hard to take,"5/2/2012-Second day taking but damn like 3 pills are actually a pretty hard to take cause of the sheer size i have been feelin a bit more energy will keep you guys further updated if any other changes occur, Also taking Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega & Animal Rage, With 100% ON Whey Protein.5/11/2012-Wow hitting the gym like a champ soreness though is eradicated regardless of how long it is and I've tried muscle confusion so theses definitely help with recovery."
3,"Works well, tastes terrible","These vitamins are chock full of everything you could ever want in a vitamin, but the taste is horrific. The smell alone opening the can makes me want to gag, but they work so well I keep taking them."
3,Good but I had to stop taking them,"Overall great product for someone who consistently has intense work outs and needs the supplements. I had to stop taking them because I would get a little nauseous from them, the smell of the pills is really strong, and the multiple giant pills just became too much for me."
4,I CAN'T TAKE THEM ALL IN THE SAME DAY,"These are just too potent for me to take all at once. So what I do is alternate taking the four largest pills one day and the rest the next day. For me this gives me a nice over all sense of well being. The secret to swallowing these pills is first get a huge glass of water. Next stand up straight, maintain good posture. Put pills in mouth. Toss them around in your mouth to moisten them so they don't hurt your throat. Chug the water, tip your head back slightly, don't overthink it and the pills should go right down. Most of all don't panic. If you think it's too much to take more than one at a time then take them one at a time. The reason I gave these 4 stars is because I can't see myself taking these regularly for the rest of my life."
2,Fat Soluble and Water Soluble Vitamins,"I used to take these vitamins regularly; however, after doing a little research, too much of a good thing can be bad for the body. I am not bashing Universal. I take a lot of other products that they produce. But you can be toxic on fat soluble vitamins: A, E, D, and K. You only need 100% of your daily value, not more. Also, you can never overdose on natural means of vitamin intake via fresh fruits and vegetables. With Universal, the doese is extremely high. With high doses of fat soluble vitamins, they begin to store in the adipose tissue, fat cells, for later use. This is very hard on the liver and diseases may produce from prolonged toxicity. Please, do some research on products you are putting into your body. The water soluble vitamins are disposed of via urine when in excess. That is why we may see a neon glow to our urine when on high doses of vitamins. Basically, it is very expensive urine!"
5,I'm a Believer,"I was not a big guy, 150 lbs and 5 ft 11. Very average. Granted i did just start lifting again from a summer off for work (college kid). I lift to stay in shape, I do not want to be the biggest guy in the gym but I take a bit of pride in my strength and health. I started these a month ago and my weight has gone from 150 to 165, and it's all muscle. By bench has gone from 185 to 205 in a month, and not just my chest, I'm adding 10%-15% weight in nearly all my routines; still not massively huge, but the results are there. I only take a pack a day and it is more than enough. My friends think I'm on steroids. I would like to note that I also take a few other supplements that may cause me to gain mass and strength: Optimum Nutrition Creatine and Whey Protein, and Craze Pre-Workout (all here on Amazon). It may not be Animal Pack giving me all the results, but for me; this combination is a winner."
3,"If it's a placebo, then it's a good placebo","I can't confirm if it truly works as it says it does, but I like to think it does. I might be making more gains now because of it, or it could be because it's an effective placebo. I can, however, confirm that A LOT of the ingredients are promptly flushed out of your system via neon green pee, because you know over 100% DV of a vitamin is no use to your body. On that same note, don't waste your money by taking it twice a day, unless you love peeing neon green all the time. It's cheap, and it's got a strong name that's been around, so I can't complain. Also, horse pills."
1,Hepatoxicity!!!,"Leaving alone the number (11) and sive (huge) of these pills compared to other multis, be warned, the body does not need, and cannot process, much more than 100% of the RDA of most vitamins. For water soluable vitiams such as B6 and C, the only danger is added stress to the kidneys (the dark urine warned of in many reviews) as the excess vitamis are excreted. Ask any doctor and he/she will tell you the same: the body excretes any vitamin A, B, and C it does not use. The real danger is in the fat soluable vitaminis, E, D and K. At over 5000 (five thousand!) times the RDA, none of which the body can elimainte (fat soulable vitmans are stored in the fat and liver, where, at too high levels, can cause toxicity). Please, please, consult with a doctor and stick with a plan that provides you with at or near 100% of the RDA."
2,Too intense for me,"Listen, I'm not a real gym rat or anything like that, so maybe this just isn't the right product for me. I found the supplement to be too intense for me, like a very strong caffeine buzz. If you really need that push to get going, this stuff probably is great, but for me, it was too much. I switched over to 5 hour energy or b12 pills pre-workout to give me a more gentle push."
5,Wow...,The amount of energy i get from this is amazing.Im not a bodybuilder but a college athlete.A year a ago i took mega men Sport and didnt notice much except for i was urinating gold.With animal pak i urinate electric yellow my focus level has risen and im happy with this investment. the pills will take a moment to get used to but after that you'll have nothing but good things to say about this.
2,Lethargic anyone?,"I bought these to step up my workouts, and now have trouble dragging myself to the gym, or even taking a jog around the block - have been taking for about a month now, hoping it was something that I needed to adjust to, and then would see results - I dont see how I can continue taking these - theyre killing my energy levels and taking me in the opposite direction I wanted to go."
5,BUILT LIKE A TANK,"So picture the scene. I was a 110lb whippet who would get blown away by the slightest of winds. I couldn't play golf due to the fact that the momentum of the swing would send me flying...worse than that, women would just laugh at me.This had to change.So fast forward to today. I discover this, frankly life changing supplement. Within a day, I was feeling different...stronger. Now, I am able to throw cars about in the parking lot outside work on my lunch break, can drive a golf ball 800yrds, and women are literally throwing themselves at me (I am currently perfecting the technique of deflecting them using nothing my pecs).This stuff is life changing...let it change YOURS!"
2,Faithful to Vitamin and Supplements,"I'm not a gym buff but I faithfully take vitamins and do cardio. Usually I take about 10 a day, at the same time. Other reviewers weren't kidding when they said these vitamins were HUGE. I almost choked just swallowing one of them. I only tried it for one day because it just made my stomach feel uneasy. My testosterone felt slightly outta whack that day also."
1,just hype,"22 horse pills, gave me a mild energy boost nothing more. Your liver will work overtime trying to digest so many pills. A strong cup of coffee and 2 mutivitamins worked better."
1,a big mess,"I bought this product because I was on a plateau during my workouts, I had no more muscle gain and my training weights were not increasing for a whole month, I did a search online for a product that might help me to break this plateau and I thought what about multivitamins, and the multivitaming of the year at one of the famous bodybuilding websites was this product here, but I din't notice that I will be adding to my daily routine 11 bills per serving, in the first day I took it with lots of water as mentioned ( a liter) and I felt that my kidneys are suffering a little but that feeling went away next day, urine turned to really dark yellow and after 15 days of this thing my stomach started to hurt and I had things like nausea so I stopped it immediately.So unless you have a really strong stomach and willing to take 11 pills a day don't go for it."
2,price went up 12 dollars,why did this products price jump up so much.....over 10 dollars in two months? it was good for 21.00 but not at this price.
5,Good product,I am very pleased with this product. I have been using this item for many years. I have been paying a higher price from other merchandisers. Now I found a better deal from this place.
3,Too Intense Maybe?,"Animal Pack works for a lot of people; I am not one of those people. When I took a pack a day, it made me feel sick (but I did see gains on it). After about a week and a half of taking a pack before gym days (5-6 days a week) so about 8-9 packs I threw up most of the pills. When this happened I said good game and stopped taking them. They just made me feel nauseous and killed my appetite. A product can't satisfy everyone, just writing to let people know: it doesn't agree with everyone. Good luck with your purchase."
4,Works Very Well,"This Animal Pak product works extremely well. I had no problem swallowig the pills (11 pills included). Only one pill tastes bad so I recommend taking with some flavored drink instead of water. This supplied me with the needed vitamins needed for my workouts and closed any holes in my diet. In addition if I was starting to get sick, this product helped keep me healthy. Overall very good. What else can you expect from a vitamin supplement?"
5,ANIMAL PAK 4 EVER,"Im 40 years old , I was tired all the time felt bad, I started taking just one pak a day, man I feel like a teenager again, I will take them forever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,should have researched this product more,"This product is over all a great multi, only problem with it was it dident work for me, with that being said, for the first 2 weeks of taking the pak, i became tired as i continued to take the pakmy fatigue increased. I looked up my symptoms, and i found out that one of the ingedients in the pak may cause strain on the liver therefor overliading youre body, botom line for me it did noy work but hey at the end of the day you can do WHATEVER THA F#$@ YOU WANNA DO!"
3,HUGE pills,"Excellent vitamin content, but the pills are hard to swallow. If big pills, the span between your 1st and 2nd knuckle of your little finger and as thick, aren't a problem I'd say buy them. I won't because they hurt going down."
3,Not Much Of A Difference In My Performance,"Fast shipping for this item. To be honest after taking these vitamins I really could not tell a difference in my performance or energy levels while at the gym. That's no to say that they won't work for anyone, they just didn't work for me."
5,A Great multi-vitamin,I have been an animal pak fan for a few years now. I have tried other multi-vitamins and just didn't get the same energy throughout the day like I did with these. The paks themselves may seem a little overwhelming to take that many pills on a daily/bi-daily basis but I adjusted to it quickly. Great product!
5,Great for beginning,Flat out great product. I began heavy lifting about three months ago and found that my body could not keep up with my routine. I was dragging through the day tired from early morning workouts. It took about a week of taking the pak before I really noticed anything more than neon pee and a funky smell coming from my gym bag in the office. I am almost finished with my first 44-Count getting ready to order another and I honestly have never felt better. I am more productive and feel generally all around better and more positive. It has helped with my workouts and provided that extra punch I needed. Thanks Animal Pak.
3,"Lots of pills, but lots of energy","I'll take this product again, because it gives me all the essential nutrients and vitamins I need to be energized for my workout. Only negative is all the pills you have to take. I've taked the Cuts before, which is a lot of pills as well, but these pills are gigantic - most of them at least.If you don't mind taking these down, then I'd highly recommend this product. Only need to take one pak a day too, unless you're trying to compete"
4,Good results - yes its 11 pills but you get value for $,"Have tried alot of mens complex vitmins these are good for the $ and the quality your assured from a REAL mfgr. You get 11 pills, and thaT MAY SEEM LIKE A LOT BUT THE results : ENERGY, STAMINA IN GYM AND BED, FEELING OF ZEN, NO JITTERS,NO FOUL ODORS OR TATE AND LITTLE TO NO GASTROINTESTINAL DISCOMFORT. Some mega paks or multi pak vitamins out there are less and more $ but fot what these do I'm sold and on auto delivery."
2,No results what so ever,"I went through a whole can of this stuff and seen no difference than when not taking the pills. Never felt more energy or that my workouts were better at all. To me it was pretty much a waste of money, it does provide a lot of vitamins though and that's the only reason i gave it 2 stars."
2,Not impressed,"I switched to Animal Pak about 3 weeks ago. I had been taking GNC Mega Men Sport, and was satisfid with that multi from an energy and 'stamina' perspective, but I was so impressed with the positive reviews of Animal Pak I decide to try it out. I am by no means a serious weigh lifter, so I wasn't looking for a multi that would help me make huge gains, just something to keep me emergized through my workouts. I take 1 packet in the morning, about 2.5 hours before my workouts.After taking this for about 3 weeks, I can say that I don't feel the sort of energy that I had with the Mega Men, in fact, I am usually dragging by 2:00 on the Animal Pak. It also tends to give me a headache, which was not a problem with the GNC product. I'll be switching back to the Mega Men Sport as soon as my Animal Pak runs out."
3,Packaging is a nightmare,"Who's the brain that came up with the ""Try Me Adapter""? I spent many more minutes than I thought necessary trying to remove these things. I'm giving this toy 3 stars and that's because my son seems to get some enjoyment out of it."
3,Well done,"Peter Hernon wrote a novel, ""8.4,"" which is about a Midwestern earthquake centered at New Madrid, which I enjoyed. So, when this popped up on a search I decided to try it.He is a good writer and I much prefer his non-fiction style to the fiction. The research shows through on every page and the story becomes really cohesive when the police arrive at the Howard Johnson's hotel. I did find it hard to truly understand the sniper but that is not due to Hernon not trying. And, maybe, no one can understand what drove him over the edge. This is a good true crime book - solidly in the middle range of authors and well worth a read."
3,Good for beginneres,"Good guide for beginners, but having worked the Callanetics program in years past, found this book a little redundant. Callanetics is a program based on protecting your back, so this particular sub-section isn't much different."
5,Good Stuff,"Any MacGyver DVD will be packed with good, clean action and language. Quite different from many of todays tv shows and movies. They are educational and most enjoyable to watch. It is nice seeing shows set in the northwest in places I've gone to."
5,Do Yourself A Favor,"Just goto Walmart, Kmart, or Target and buy it for $28 when it comes out. No Shipping charges either. There is no excuse for Amazon.com to be charging so much for the DVDs except greed.I gave it 5 stars because of the product, not because of amazon.com."
5,Looking Forward to this One.,"Bought if for our son, which he expressed interest in it, being a MacGyver lover. Came on time, in great shape & good price. I'm looking forward to him opening it up, knowing it's something he definetely wanted."
2,Hmm... What went wrong here?,"I don't like giving bad reviews, but apart from ""legend of the holy rose parts 1 and 2"", and ""halloween knights"" (a murdoc episode), the others I really found rather boring. far too much preachy talkie guf, and not enough MacGyverisms and action.Season 6 picks up again a bit, but beware, by this time the writers really were running short of good storylines, and the show was past it's best.Season's 1 and 2 were fantastic, 3 and 4 were still very good, but 5 is the weakest in the set, with 6 being mediocre, and 7 little better.Overall I would give Season 5 a 4/10"
2,not happy,I love watching mcgyver but this edition kept freezing in the middle of one of his ideasand then skip to the end
5,Great inside view of Martin Guitars rich history,"Even though I own more Taylors than Martins (6 Taylors and 3 Martins), I absolutley love this book. Richard Johnston and Dick Boak take Mike Longworth's classic book and expand it with great, honest insight and outstanding pictures. They are not afraid to show the warts along with the wonderful history that has made Martin such a phenominal company. It's fun to see the statistics on the the differnt models and the limited number of craftsmen they had making these instruments for much of their history. The other fun thing, is you get a good sense of the musical styles and fads that happened across America during the past 175 years, and how that impacted Martin's direction. If you ever get the chance to visit the factory, you won't be sorry. I've stopped by four different times during the past ten years; and the new museum, store and picking room are a huge improvement over my first visit in '99.Kevin - Green Bay, WI"
3,Amazon's Pricing Policy On This Item,"I posted this comment previously, and Amazon apparently deleted it after a few days. So here's the gist of it again. I bought this book at $30, and a few days later Amazon reduced the price to $19.80. I contacted Customer Service and requested a credit for the difference, which Amazon refused to provide. I was told that my only option was to return the book and then reorder it at the lower price. Does this make any sense? Does it improve customer relations? Of course not.The book is OK. Amazon's customer relations policy is NOT OK."
4,Recipe for Fun,"Jane Amanda Edwards is a meddling, irritating, yet somehow very endearing spinster. Through her friend, Detective Captain George Hammond, she hits on the idea of publishing a town cookbook. She is determined to bully, coerce or flat out steal the recipes she wants. Through her total lack of social skills, she becomes involved in a murder-which to her is merely an inconvenience to her cookbook. This domestic cozy is humorous and engaging. Also contains recipes!"
3,"Useful parts, but a disappointing whole","Cultural studies academics often end up throwing a lot of ideas out at the reader, hoping that some will stick. Wright's book reads more like a collection of essays than a coherent study of the social image of the tank. Some of the chapters are good (the mysticism of J.F.C. Fuller, the tank in Poland) while others show weak research (the modern U.S. Army and the tank.) In some places, especially as the book closes in on contemporary issues, one can easily detect the modern academics sniffy disdain for anyone who wears a uniform. Especially an American uniform. And where is any discussion of the image of victorious panzers in Nationalist Socialist propaganda? Nonetheless, this is book worth reading, less so for the tank buff than for a reader who is interested more in the impact of war upon society. Recommended for college and university collections."
1,Difficult to read,"Wright has an unusual writing style in that his sentences are very long. Up to 9 or ten lines in many places. The book covers mundane topics such as public opinion of tanks, cartoonists and writers perceptions of the tank and so on. The book drags like an anchor in many places.The book is full of snipits of trivia and information that you won't find elsewhere concerning the development of the tank from WWI to the present day. The book does a good job discussing Russian and German tank warfare on the eastern front. He also does a fine job describing the six day war and the Yom Kippur wars in the middle east. However, he does not discuss the U.S very much. He hardly mentions the M-60, and the M-48 tanks and devotes a thin chapter to the M-1. My advice is to skip this one and buy Tom Clancy's Armored Cav."
2,Disappointing as a Military History of Tanks,"I bought this book to read about tanks and in the very first chapter found that the author was more interested in addressing political, philosophical, social, ethical and other issues than tanks. This chapter devotes 19 pages to the ramifications of a young man standing in front of a tank at Tiananman Square. The author makes massive use of adjectives and has numerous quotations from others which in many cases add very little."
2,'Tank' by Patrick Wright,"Someone with a military cast of mind seriously interested in the development of the tank and tank tactics will be sorely disappointed. This is more a hagiography for J.F.C. Fuller and an anthology of arcane, English-orientated factoids. Read the 'Publisher Weekly Review' very carefully, particularly the last half. It may save you money and frustration."
3,good but not great,"howdy y'all,this turned out to be less tasty than i was expecting. not _bad_ by any means. i certainly enjoyed it. the flavor is rather less nifty than the garlic rice product they put out. this one ...Zatarain's New Orleans Style Garlic & Herb Rice Mix, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)oddly, when reheated it tastes slightly oriental to me. [*grin*] it's very definitely not as spicy the 2nd time around.i used olive oil instead of butter and about half a pound of chicken breast. it's entertaining to see one of the other reviews mention that it needed the full pound of chicken to absorb some of the spice. [*grin*] people really are different.rated a THREE cuz it's neither more nor [very much] less than expected.take care,lee"
5,Still Valid Today,"Wm. J. Lederer's ""A Nation Of Sheep"" is probably more important today than when it was written, some 40+ years ago. I highly recommend a thoughtful re-read of this book before November. It is hard to find - except on Amazon.com - but well worth the effort."
3,"Not bad, could go somewhere","Some on the net call this emo, and Mr. Holland has a good emo style voice, but manages to elevate this music above that style (which I despise) by injecting some rock into the mix and keeping the hook level high. ""Passive Agressive"" I wouldn't call emo, and ""War Brides"" moves right along. Unfortunately there's a country twinge here that breaks into total objectional country funk stuff like ""Love Comes"" that I classify as a complete miss. ""Mermaid"" could have been a great anthem rocker but is soiled a bit by a laid back country feel as well that fails to support the solid chorus. ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Intentions"" are straight c&w pop for that matter. I don't know, if you can write pleasant song passages you can go a long way, but this would have to take a hard right turn from Nashville to grab me."
2,Weak learning tool good introduction to software choices,"Do not purchase this book if your intention is to learn the technicalities of DVD authoring. It is only an introduction to most of the software products out there right now.Purchase this book if you intend to attain a software product and are unsure which to select among the many choices out there.It is a good overview of these products and would be a very useful book for this purpose.There is discussion about DVD authoring but it is weak and vastly incomplete. As a long time author and owner of several products, and all books on the subject I am dissappointed with this book. I would have liked to have seen at least some command sequence examples. There are none. If you wish to learn the intricacies of DVD authoring,do a course."
1,A rehash of software manuals,"The author appears to have done little more than collect a sheaf of manufacturers' literature and then rewrite it for this book. A typical chapter contains a step by step description of the tutorial that comes with Apple's DVD Studio Pro software. You'll get a lot more more from simply working through the tutorial than from reading Dixon's rehash of same, and you won't have to waste money on this book. Some overlap is perhaps inevitable, but 500+ pages of regurgitated material? No thanks! Save your money and wait for David Pogue to cover this topic."
4,Useful Information,"I bought this book at the same time I bought ""Ticket to the Opera"" by Goulding. As an introduction to opera, Goulding's book is better written and more objective; however, ""Rough Guide"" includes information on more operas and what's available on CD. This is a very useful source of information, but as other reviewers have suggested, investigate other sources before buying anything. Personally, I like to have more than one reference of this sort available, because like all art, evaluating opera is a matter of opinion; guidelines are helpful, but the individual listener or viewer is the ultimate arbiter on what he or she appreciates most."
2,Wait for the next edition!,"There are many obvious mistakes in this book. Could have used a good editing before publication. In addition to those mentioned by another reader, they say that Domingo is in charge of the San Francisco Opera (meaning LA?)."
3,"Okay, not great","I bought the game. I bought the book. It was okay, but when I was done, I felt I could have lived without the book. I didn't really find it a big help."
4,"Great for beginners, stats charts in appendices were helpful","This book has a lot of helpful tips, and looks like it would be very helpful for beginners at this game, or those who know RTS, but haven't played AoE III. The scenario walkthroughs for the single player campaign are very detailed, and I use the charts that layout the details of each unit very heavily. All in all, a pretty good book. (Could use some color, though)"
2,Not that Impressed,"The book Contains very little information about ""treaty' and multiplayer stragety and too much on the single player walk thrus. The advice given in the book otherwise was good, I was suprised to find so many ""typos"" in the book. Guess the editor was on Vacation!"
1,12 volt battary cam recorder,"Order a 12 volt battary from amazon, battary was dead, and would not take a charge went to radio shack and bought one and put on my charger and charge up in 1-1/2 hours. amazon battary no#RCA 1cvai56. Had to put 1 star for rateing or review would not take."
4,Very functional bed,"My daughter really likes her ""big girl"" bed. The drawer underneath doesnt quite have the height that i was hoping for but works well fo sheet and other thin blankets."
2,Disappointment,The bed arrived with dents and scratches. The box was barely holding together when it arrived so the packing was terrible. It couldn't take the abuse UPS put it through. Metal parts for the drawers were bent and we will have to replace. So it came from the factory with problems. We were so excited to get the bed for our daughter and it turned into dissappointment at the quality.
2,"Not a fan, still looking","This mask does block the light really well, as advertised. But, my eyes must be just a little too big, because when I wear this mask, the very inner edges of the foam eye-cutouts rest on the very outer corners of my eyes, and that foam feels like sandpaper on an area as sensitive as that!Seriously, rub along the very outer corners of your eyes... Can you image a foam edge, putting pressure (from the Velcro head-strap) right in the corners of your eyes? Now try sleeping like that.I had to use another, soft sleep mask underneath this one, to pad it. Which of course interferes with REM sleep. I'm on here hoping to find a contoured sleep mask with bigger eye-holes..."
1,Disappointed,"Looked like what I need but there is a down side or two. Excellent at blocking light, however the frame is stiff plastic. When I lie down on my pillow the relative inflexibility of the frame pushes the whole thing out of place. The foam lining is very soft, but is BARE, uncovered foam and is irritating against the delicate skin whenever I move. Why isn't there a soft fabric cover or something similar? Bad design for this purpose. Thumbs down, I'm afraid."
2,Uncomfortable,The other reviews are correct about both its blocking ability and its lack of comfort. I honestly don't see how they can make a product made of such hard material and expect it to be comfortable. Don't use unless you only sleep on your back and then only if you have no feeling in your face.
4,if the shoe fits....,"Kenneth Cole makes some fine, fine shoes. For example; these shoes. The leather is a little stiff but it holds a shine pretty well, and with the padded upper & cushioned insoles, these shoes are quite comfortable."
4,"Good Story, but too many ups and downs...","I really did enjoy this book, but the constant emotional turmoil of the H/H got somewhat tiresome. They both kept dredging up past hurts that got in the way of possible present happiness. Finally, they overcame their painful pasts and were able to move forward, but there were a lot of ups and downs..."
4,Walk in Beauty,"In reviewing the list of reviews I have submitted below, I believe it is up to each reader to determine theirreaction to each and every book they read. What may appeal to one reader may not appeal to another;therefore I will refrain from writing further reviews."
5,Only those with a sense of humor need apply,"I'm not really into mysteries and I'm not usually into science fiction either, but I am into laughing my tail off and that's what happened with Anonymous Rex. I can't believe there's someone out there who didn't love this book. But then again, I run into these people all the time. Humorless drones. Don't know how to have fun. This book rocked, and I'll read whatever else this weird guy writes."
5,Sexy Rex,"Wow.From the first line to the last, this book simply oozes charm and skill. Crazy concept, brilliantly executed, with enough twists and turns to put a snake in traction. I eagerly await Casual Rex, his novel in progress. Here's hoping it stays as fresh as the first.If you haven't read this (then why would you be reading this?), go buy it. Buy it now, find a few free hours, and read it."
5,YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!,"This book is hilarious, I loved the concept of dinosaurs guised up as humans! It's a strange combination but it works. I was addicted from beginning to end, good plot, great concept and it is incredibly humourously told. All I can say is...I WANT MORE! Look out for his upcoming book Casual Rex. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK, especially if you like detective books with imagination."
3,"Definitive, but flawed","A welcome volume on an important, yet unsung, aircraft. Excellent detail on a wide variety of variants. Unfortunately, the book could have benefited from another proofreading for spelling and style. The author should learn the distinction between the Greek ""Alpha"" and the NATO phonetic ""ALFA."""
5,wonderful!,This product has been fabulous for the nasty runny nose sinus problems during this cold and flu season. Highly recommended!
2,Package looked old and stained. Afraid to use.,Item came in a box that was yellowed and old. Box was stained. I am afraid to use the meds.
2,To Roger from Buffalo NY,What the reviewer was trying to say is that Carlos Mencia is a phoney comedian trying to pass himself off as a 100% pure latino which he is not. Be true to yourself. And that is something Carlos isn't. True to himself.
1,Horrible Horrible,This dude is the most unoriginal thief of all time. In the comedy world Menstealia is the equivalent of a grapefruit to the fruit world. He's trying to copy the delicious orange but falls amazingly short. Too bad none of the comedians he's ripped off over the years don't get a cut of the comedy central money he received for this abomination.
5,FUNNY AS HELL,the show is freaken funny. by the way not to put the isuee down in anyway(imagration battle) this is NOT a political comment board so take that some place else.
1,Wow. This is a really bad show.,"I wish I could like this show, then I wouldn't have to change the channel every time it comes on. I'm not sure why he's not funny, he's doing the exact same thing Dave Chappelle is doing except from a Mexican's POV. I think it is because he tries too hard. The only thing mildly funny are the commercials advertising the show. This is the kind of show you want to have on for ambient noise, like if you are on a computer or talking to someone on the phone. BTW, I love shows like Wonder Showzen, Family Guy, and Drawn Together, and I rarely get offended. So it's not that I am offended by the show at all it is just that it isn't funny."
4,...because he's FUNNY !!!,"""If you can't tell the joke in front of the people it's about, then you can't tell the joke ANYWHERE !!!"" That's a quote from NO STRINGS ATTACHED, but it sums up the Mencia philosophy. What makes me laugh (out loud, and sometimes even before I realize I'm laughing)is the element of truth (or sometimes the stereotype that we accept as the truth) in his show. (I watched the first season of Mind of Mencia and his openning monologues (alone!) are worth the price of an admission ticket to see him live.)Carlos Mencia is ""calling out"" the elephant-in-the-room (race)and if it makes you mad enough to talk about it -BRAVO CARLOS !!! Job well done!"
1,He makes me hate this world that we all share,One of the worst things you can watch on TV. Boring lame jokes that are all the same. If this man still has his home there is no justice in the world.
5,Can't wait for season 2,He is too funny... if you are easily offended... or don't really want to hear the truth this isn't for you. This is a man speaking about what he beleives and really not caring... keep up the good work Mencia... Can't wait for Season 2!!!
2,not all that great,No re-watchability for this one. Its one and done. Might as well get it from blockbuster and return it instead of wasting all the money.
2,DEE DE DEEEEEEEE,"i really gave this show a chance, i watched a couple of episodes, actually i'm watching it now.. jeezusCarlin >>> Mencia... how dare you compare themi love chapelle, proof that racial humor can be funny.this is shite"
4,You either Hate Mencia or Love Mencia,"I personally think he's as funny as dave, but brings in more racist controversy. It's not all black/white, but he disses on everyone, and most of all, stupid people. If your looking for something different, or like Mencia, you will be happy with this purchase."
2,Not much of a book,"This book's pretty boring, I'm sorry to say. It's not written all that well, with sloppy dialogue and ineffective action/suspense scenes. The ending is nothing more than an sf deus ex machina, a cop out. Go watch your favorite TNG episode instead."
4,Vermin-shy no more!!,Never have vermin been so redeeming and so brilliantly dressed! From Wee Willy Weasel himself to Wily Toad to Sneaky Little Snake--the characters come alive with each turn of the page. Vivid pictures and rhyming text make this little book a treat! Hurray for the author's unique take on characters and a valuable lesson! My nieces and nephews can't get enough of Wee Willy and it's incredibly detailed pictures!One question? What will Wee Willy's new adventure and lesson be?!!
3,Too small for the price,I thought personally it was a little on the small side for the price I paid. Especially concidering it is August and I only have 5 more months left in the planner.
3,prefer roller rack,"The paper towel stand is good looking, but it needs rubber stoppers on the short legs. I don't think I will be buying another one."
4,Good item for the bathroom,"I chose this product while looking for something more sanitary than a hand towel to have in the bathroom when I have guests in my home. I wish it weighed a little more, especially if I was going to use it daily in the kitchen. For a guest or a main floor bathroom, it works great."
4,Looking for a Tough Jigsaw Puzzle?,Then Crime and Punishment is for you! This book entertains a serious literary reader with its complex plots and characters. The story of a murderer in a denial confuses the reader with his mentality and motives.Although I did give this novel 4 stars for Dostoevsky's writing but this book didn't click very well with me because I am more of a romance reader. I read this for a Russian literature course. One of the things that Dostoevsky has never failed to impress me was the metaphors in this novel. This is a certain metaphor that I thought was the best I've ever read but I can't remember where it is in the novel but I do know that it's after when Duna dumps her fiance. Definitely a great writer to look up for excellent writing and go by his examples!!!
1,"like getting hit by a sledgehammer, repeatedly","Reading C&P is like getting hit on the head with a sledgehammer, repeatedly. The author has a point to make; he makes it. Then, just in case you didn't get it, he makes it again. And again. And again. There, now did you get it? The entire book could be condensed into a short story and still effectively convey the same message. And on a more minor note, shouldn't *something* happy happen at least once in a novel? Shouldn't there be at least one scene in which a little birdie chirps a happy song from a pretty tree? Does *everyone* have to be spitting up their lungs into the gutter on a dark and gloomy day? Sheesh!!"
2,"For Diehard Coltrane Fans Only, I Think","I think you have to be a really serious fan of Coltrane to enjoy this album. Without hearing another version of Love Supreme before listening to this one, I don't think you can appreciate the longer version. I would not want this to be one's first exposure to John Coltrane - older and less unconventional pieces like Equinox, My Favorite Things, and others might be a better place to start. I am only a casual Coltrane fan, and I was put off by both tracks.This performance has been issued under several labels, one which added Naima as a bonus track."
5,good service,the first one received was bad. They immediatly sent another one and it works fine. word word word word word
4,"HES NO SEAN PAUL, BUT THIS GUY CAN JAZZ!","THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCTION AND I LIKE IT CAUSE ITS FAST, YOU KNOW? LIKE BAM! HIT YOU WITH THAT JAZZY SASSY AND ALTOGETHER FLASHLY STUFF, ITS FAST BUT MAYBE NOT AS FAST AS I WAS EXPECTING. SEAN PAUL IS DEFNITELY THE SUCCESSOR OF JOHN'S STYLE (HIS FASTNESS OF LYRICS, HES OBVIOUSLY NOT A JAZZMAN!) SERIOUSLY THOUGH I LIKE THE START OF THE ALBUM AND THE END, THE MIDDLES A 'BIT' PATCHY BUT HEY THATS WHAT YOU GET! SO LETS ALL BE THANKFUL EH?"
1,"Jeez, what a [ham]!","Golly. All my friends rant and rave about John Coltrane and how good he is. He just knows how to play really fast. His solos sound like he is making them up as he goes along. This guy needs to take some lessons from some real sax masters like Kenny G. He also needs a cool hair style like Kenny G. I heard his friend Eric Dolphy, and he really [is'nt good], too..."
5,Scariest sax I ever heard!,"This was the first Jazz CD I ever bought and I have been an addict since. To this day, it still floors me. Not every tune on Giant Steps is as fast as the ""fully-automatic"" assault which is COUNTDOWN, in fact there are some really nice laid back tunes. Great variety, great musicianship. Only album I can put next to this with Coltrane is his ""Village Vanguard"" Box set."
3,"good, but don't see what the fuss is all about","A very famous album, but somehow it kind of bores me. There's alot of originals that have become standards, and for that reason alone it's worth getting to know, since it's always fun when you hear someone else play a song you know. But as I said, it's not one of my favorites. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent album. Naima is wonderful, and there's plenty of strong tracks.When I introduce this album to friends who know even less about jazz than me, it's not nearly as appealing to them as, say Kind of Blue or Ah-Um would be."
4,more good coltrane,"Another quality entry into the John Coltrane discography. He was one of the greats, along with Dolphy,miles davis and in rock, hendrix and Zappa(Hot rats)"
5,Brilliant,"How can anyone rate this less than 5 stars? It is a sheer work of genius. I am certainly no jazz expert, but I know enough to know that this album is amazing. And you also most certainly do not need to be a jazz expert to enjoy this album. It is totally accessible to anyone who appreciates great music. The booklet includes an interesting essay on the music and the man, by Nat Hentoff. The 5 bonus tracks are certainly a plus and make this cd certainly worth buying. In fact, this is an album that every true-blue jazz fan should own."
5,Must have for any Coltrane fan.,"This is one of the very best ""early"" Coltrane albums. It shows the development of his scale pattern approach to improvisation, and remains quite melodic. The CD has bonus tracks that number almost as many as the original album, adding tracks from the ""Alternate Takes"" album. After listening to Giant Steps for years, it is great to hear the extra solos on these great tunes. In addition to Coltrane's great sound is a superb rhythm section, including bassist Paul Chambers. I rarely pass up a chance to check out a Paul Chambers recording. END"
4,Giant shoes,"Up to that point, Coltrane's first for Atlantic began what many consider his definitive reign as accessibly edgy bandleader, providing the launching point for his first true artistic streak which merged his formalized writings with a cultivated soloing which needed to expand outward ever since."
5,Beyond Perfect,"This a classic, ""must have"" CD. There are 5 bonus tracks consisting of alternate takes. A few years ago I was sitting behind Tommy Flannigan at Fat Tuesday's in NYC. Behind Tommy Flannigan, at the same table as me, was a woman piano player from California. She advised me to buy ""Giant Steps"". When I asked her who the piano player was, she pointed at Mr. Flannigan. Boy, did I feel like a newbie."
5,Nice and Soft,These are nice hand towels. They are soft and not at all flimsy. They are definitely worth the price.
4,In short: good buy,"Good quality towels came at a good price, and quickly. I highly recommend shopping here."
5,A Welcome Surprise,"I paid $4.99 for a pack of 4 of these washcloths, and wasn't expecting too much in the way of quality. Well, was I pleasantly surprised! These are fairly thick and the have a really nice border and are finished very nicely. I have others I bought from a discount store that I paid double for, that are almost like these, but a different border. I know I will be buying this brand again, should I need any more!! Well worth the price!!"
3,glad they were on sale,low quality-not well shaped and they shed like crazy in the dryer however they hold their color very well but for me it was fine in that I only bought them for use outside but if they were to be my house cloths Id be upset more and send them back-very low quality
1,storyteller,"I bought these washcloths because I have so much trouble with the perfumes in stores. I hoped these didn't carry a perfumey smell and they didn't. They do however have a strange odor to them. I don't know what it is but it won't come out in the wash. They were thick and big enough, not skimpy. One did come unstiched in the wash. I will use them to wash my car not my body."
3,Bath towels,"These are nice bath towels. The problem i have with them is they keep making fuzzys on my face. Its taking a lot of washes to get them to go away.Also, The color of butter is closer to a yellow than i wanted."
3,"Good deal, for the price","Honestly i bought these towels for open houses at an apartment i'm selling. They look nice - although they are somewhat light weight and not that soft. I haven't washed them yet, so i'm not sure how they will do... But for the price, they really are a good deal and i would buy them again. Definitely a good guest towel, if not for everyday use."
2,good at start but not to last,"Very good for my taste. Absorbent and not mushy. However, the lint it keeps on shedding means that it will not last 6 months, and the binding has started to enravel. Nothing worse that side shredding within 2 months of use and washing."
1,Not a good deal,These towels are not a good deal. I guess you get what you pay for. We purchased the navy blue towels and they shed a lot. They also filled the dryer with fuzz and look horrible after just one wash. We have thrown them in the trash after one use. NOT RECOMMENDED!
1,Lame,Disappointing. Girls were hot but...not really much else to say. It's that bad. Really. I could go on but why waste the time. I already wasted my money on the damn thing.
3,Girls Gone Wild: Spring Break Uncensored,The Girls Gone Wild Videos are getting rather repetitive in what they show especially on the bus or in hotel rooms and are getting rather boring. The part of the their videos that I like the best is when they are on the beach.
3,Disappointed in this book,"I love a good bone chiller but this certainly was not it. This reminded me of a summer read a young teen would enjoy. The book was actually too easy to read. I guess I like a little bit more of a challenging book that keeps you guessing and makes you think. It starts off as a story of a mother's hope of the possibility of her son being alive then explodes into this action adventure and then science fiction. A lot of it was plain out ridiculous. Especially, when the son is sending his mother messages telepathically.The end of the book was a simple ending compared to all the action going on. It was almost like the author couldn't make up his mind how he wanted to write his book. The book was a quick read that's what I did like about it but kept hoping it was going to get better. Of course, my favorite read is ""Lovely Bones"", and so reading this afterwards may have spoiled it for me. This book was not a well written book. I was very disappointed"
2,Disappointed,"One gets the feeling the author was rushed, because this tale is awkward and the characters poorly developed. I realize that Mr. Koontz has reworked an earlier book but there are unrealistic turns of events as well as superficial descriptions. At one point, Elliot says to Tina ""that's not the Tina I know"". Considering that he has only known her for about 24 hours when he makes this statement, it is a ridiculous thing to say. At any rate, if you are looking for a quick and easy read, this book will do the trick."
2,Mother's love can beat out Govmt spooks,"It was exciting, though seemed unfinished. But I like the fact that he included the death of Vince Foster as an example of fishy govmt explanation, and possible coverup by our prevaricator-in-chief. But I personally don't care for magical explanations of anything."
3,For Dean Koontz this book was very mild.,"This book was one of Dean Koontz's earlier books rewritten and released, I personally can tell a big difference in his writing. As in all of his earlier books this book had a lot more romance in it, and lacked in a complete ending. As to where most of his books let you know for sure what's going to happen after everything is done and over with this book left you wondering where it would go from here. With an ending like that it's hard to enjoy the book, otherwise the plot and idea was good and ranked right up there with the rest of his books."
5,GREAT!!,I am Brazilian and I had never read an English book before this one. I loved it! It grabbed me from the first page and couldn't stop reading it! I could count my goose bumps!
2,"What happened, Dean?","Every now and then a superb author has a mistake. Taken with Koontz masterpieces such as Phantoms and Watchers, this is a very weak effort. This book fails terribly in descriptiveness that you'll finish the story before getting to know everybody. Maybe decent for a short read but you'll be better off picking a copy of Dragon Tears."
2,pretty weak effort,"Koontz has written several wonderful novels. This one, unfortunately, isn't one of them. The main characters are incredibly shallow, others are too black and white. The plot is too predictable. I've read about a dozen of Koontz's books, and this is definitely the worst of them."
4,I read this book a few years ago and I still think about it.,"This story just somehow seemed to stick with me... I usually read Romance, but was given this one day. I couldn't put it down. I'm normally a wimp for suspense, but I just HAD to find this book again. I thought it was fantastic!"
2,"Startted out good, and endend like he was in a hurry.","Dean Koontz, has writtin many books, and though this was one of his early books I get the feeling that he lost interest in his writing of this book about mid way. He quickly threw in charactors to kill off some of the main ones. And then in the last few chapters it was like he didn't care anymore and he just wanted to get the book completed. I suggest to read another book from Koontz, he has done much better than this book."
1,Boring!!!!,"I read this book because the back fascinated me,it seemed like it would be about something more realistic but it turned out to be a science fiction book that was not very good and way to unrealistic. I belive a book can be unrealistic but this was way to far fetched and it ended up having a stupid plot.Dont waste your time with this book if you want a good one ""Intesity"" or ""Phantoms""are good novels but dont waste your time with this junk."
1,fast paced is another word for sensationalist stupidity,"Dean Koontz is a writer that ignores plot and interest, the ending was weak and stupidly easy. the beginning had promise, but then the book looked if he had forgotten deadline and had to write the rest all in one hour, using plot devices as a omnipotent benefactor and to save the plot by bringing up the redeeming social value of experimenting on small children (as he did in Door To december). it was terrible and sadistic."
2,"silly, stupid and predictable","Firstly, I love reading Dean Koontzs books. This book was the 17th book I read from him, but the worst yet. One of the things I like about his books is that you wonder could it really happen. Not with this one. The boy danny stoping bullets coming out of guns with his mind is a bit much for me. You always know the good guys are always going to win in the end. The book has a very weak storyline too. The last couple of his books that I read have been a big let down (Lightning and Fear Nothing -both terrible). I'm beginning to wonder if he has any other ideas other than corrupt undercover agancies, governments and laborotories? Also, does there always have to be a dog in the storyline? I must have read all the brilliant books first - Phantoms, The voice of the night, Strangers, Whispers and the servants of twilight."
3,INTERESTING THRILLER,"This book was okay. It starts out like any novel, and then slowly progresses into a mystery/thriller. It keeps you guessing until the end; but the end is disappointing. It gets just a little sci-fi-ish at the end. I know sci-fi isn't supposed to be ""believable"" but the ending is really too much. It starts to lose the thrilling part. This was my first experience with Koontz, and I am not sure I would read it again, although I may give him another try in the future-maybe."
4,The Eyes of Darkness,"I read this book years ago, published under the name Leigh Nichols. I found one other book by Leigh Nichols in my searching, and that book was ""Shadowfires."" Both books I enjoyed tremendously. When I first discovered Dean Koontz, I found him intriging, if somewhat familiar, at times spooky, at times boring and repetitious, but mostly good. I was quite surprised to learn that Nichols and Koontz were one in the same, especially since he republished both ""The Eyes of Darkness"" and ""Shadowfires"", under his own name, without so much as a mention of his psuedonym Leigh Nichols. Does that mean that Leigh Nichols is the real writer, and Dean Koonz just a figment of her imagination? Or does it mean that Dean Koontz just doesn't believe the readers who knew him before he was a household name are important enough to keep informed?"
5,Excellent pulled me right through Dean at his best.,"Great book from a great author. A very fast read, just pulls you right in and keeps you turning pages hour after hour."
4,Dean does it again,"As if the show wasn't rough enough on her but to come home to the chalkboard in her sons room that had died a year eariler bearing the words ""NOT DEAD"". Tina was suffering a lot of stress, but she still wantes to get to the bottom of this, who would play such a cruel joke. Have any ideas, I do. One of Dean's must read books. He keeps adding colorful twists to each novel, you'll love this one. It'll even get you thinking as to how much do we really know"
3,Was hoping for more...,"2.5 StarsWhile I feel like this book started pretty strong, I was disappointed with how it ended. It felt a little rushed. This is one of Koontz's earlier books, and I think it shows. Worth a read, as are all of Koontz's books, but not one of my favorites..."
4,Typical Koontz--But Typically Great!!!!!,"Yeah it's a lot of what Koontz normally writes. Down and out mom who just recently lost her son, so she's seriously depressed. Of course she starts getting strange messages that he may be alive. Throw in some sentient animals and you basically have a plot Koontz has re-hashed time and again.But, he does it well... the Koontz formula pays off here, with a wonderfully-entertaining story."
4,A Mother's Love,"A tale that will keep you guessing. The scene is Las Vegas... After the supposed death of her son, Danny, Tina Evans starts obsessing over the belief that he is infact still alive... This is an intense story filled with action and science fiction along with an interwoven love story. I could not put it down. This is a great read and I would recommend it to any Dean Koontz or Steven King fan."
3,reveiw,"This book, while an excellent demonstration of an authors talent in drawing a make believe world into the reality, could have been better. It was a very good book but I think Koontz could have taken more time to explain. There were a few holes in the plot and it left me wondering about certain things at the end. The ending was also somewhat abrupt and unsatisfactory. However, as negative as this reveiw may seem, this book was very good. If I could I go back in time, I would read this book once again and have no regrets about it."
3,The Eyes,"The Eyes of Darkness is one of Dean Koontz's best novels, but not his best. This book deals with the paranormal, such as, telekinesis and premonitions. If you are in to this sort of stuff, then I would recommend reading it. I prefer The Door to December, because it is based on some facts of life.I would recommend reading this book before The Door because if you are not into the paranormal then you will be disappointed after reading the Door then this book. This book could have used a little bit more suspense and less paranormal. That is why I like The Door better than this book, it carries more suspenseful details.I really do enjoy reading all of Koontz's books no matter what they are about, because they all seem to be filled with suspense, romance, and humor; some of them have more than others, but they all are good."
3,Interesting but lacking,"Upon reading this book I have come to the conclusion that I liked the book but it was lacking. The characters were strong, the plot was decent and it kept you hanging. At the end of some chapters the author left you wanting desparately to know what happend next. Compared to other books I've read it wasn't good. I have read some very intense books. I've read one other Dean Koontz books: ""Funhouse"". That book was interesting and creepy. This was a good book and if you like mystery, supernatural spook stuff, this would be an enjoyable read for you. Overall ""Eyes of Darkness"" was a good book."
4,Yea,It's spongebob-irritating and entertaining at the same time. I love being able to view digital items-yay technology. Three more words.
5,Love it!,"I love Spongebob!!! Love it, love it, love it!!! There are parts I just laugh about even after I watch it, then I have to make up something just so I can explain why I am laughing!!! Crazy right?!?! TOTALLY LOL!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,this is not the 60s Marmalade : (,"(Note: I gave this 3 stars because I feel neutral about this album. I neither like it nor dislike it).I don't own this album, but I listened to this entire album wondering why it didn't sound anything like the Marmalade from the 60s. And so I looked it up and found out it was a debut album by an indie group.For those who enjoy today's indie music, you may take a liking to this album, but for those of us who prefer oldies music, this may not be for us."
3,Three Stars For One Song,"There isn't much information available on the site about this album but the original title was ""2525 (exordium & terminus"") released in 1969 by RCA Victor. The first time I heard ""In The Year 2525 (exordium & terminus"")(the song's full title) I was a kid riding his bicycle with an A M radio taped to the handlebars. The prophetic song was originally written by Rick Evans in 1964 and when he joined forces with Denny Zager in 1968 they pressed their own copies of the song and it was eventually brought to the attention of RCA. The rest of the album's tunes are reminiscent of Don McLean's American Pie album; One big hit with a bunch of folksey sounding filler surrounding it."
1,This is a bootleg CD,"I do not have this CD, but I do know that this is a bootleg disc of Zager & Evans's 2 RCA albums, plus the Truth label version of ""In The Year 2525"" and the 45 version of ""Mister Turnkey"" as a bonus track. These 2 albums will soon be reissued by Wounded Bird, so potential buyers should buy theIn the Year 2525 (Exordium & Terminus)/Zager & Evanstwofer on Wounded Bird that is linked in this review instead of the bootleg, even though the bonus material is not included."
3,Not Hartley's best.**1/2 out of *****,"By no means i liked the film, i almost liked it. ALMOST.I liked the acting, some of the music and the humor.But the film began to get boring and with many cliches.But i liked the film, because Mr. Hartley challenged critics, but unfourtanely he missed here.If you want to see a great Hartley flick see Henry Fool.There are many much better things there in HF than in No Such Thing and the music is much better there. And you will see Hartley's full potential."
3,"drunk, depressed monster","This movie is very much over the top. A part of me says it is stupid and another part enjoys it because of that. The monster was a very lovable character in my opinion because: 1.) he is amazingly more cynical than I am and 2.) he drinks more than my ex-roomate 3.) he wants to kill himself and 4.) he lives in seclusion..we have a lot in common. I thought to myself, 'damn, I wish this monster was real so I could date him.' The girl in this movie was dumb, but I liked her determination...her journey could have been a bit more strenuous but I suppose there was no point in dragging this movie out. The news woman boss and the monster did the best acting, and the girl was so-so (her strong moments seemed faked). The Dr. was cool because he was spaced out and kept touching people."
1,Waste of precious time,"Also waste of HM talents.neither funny, nor romantic, nor scary.Started slow and deteriorated in ravings of a lunatic.Weird and boring at the same time.I could not comprehend the 5 stars review - sorry."
2,Parts Of It Were Funny,"There were a couple of really funny scenes between the monster and Beatrice, and some parts of the ""monster in us"" motif that hit close to home, but No Such Thing just lacks the kind of energy to make me say ""hmmmm, not a bad film"" at the end. Some really nice cinematography and social satire, but ultimately it's not the kind of movie I'd recommend. Hartley tries -- he really does -- maybe that's the most redeeming value to be taken from No Such Thing.Stacey"
3,"Well acted, wished for a more upbeat ending","Well acted, well crafted story abbout the way situations changed characte's life. I was hoping for a mor uplifting ending but I ma not sure it could have ended any other way."
5,Hal Hartley's best in my view so far!,"I think this is Hal Hartley's best film. Gotta love the Monsters view on human existence. It's a slow dry humor thought provoking film, not an action flick, but I feel it's well worth the time. Also I'd like to throw in that I'm a big fan of his Music he writes for his flims."
2,Total Rip Off,"This toy was a total rip off. It's so much smaller than I pictured and to add insult to injury, I paid $50 for this toy and the box had a price tag of $9.99. At least if you are going to rip people off, take the price off the box! Since I had to open the box to see what it looks like, I can't return it now. What a bleeding rip off. Not happy at all...I gave it 2 stars overall only b/c my son likes it and it hasn't broken YET.Also, the seller said I played with it and I NEVER did. I only let my son play with it it when I was told I couldn't return the item since I broke the tape. I wanted to see what it looked like and when I simply opened it, NOT taking items out of their packages, I was told I couldn't return the item. That's the ONLY reason I let my son take the item out of the box. And, I thought this item was NEW. It's a USED toy sold WAY overpriced!"
4,Careers in Law,"This book is very handy for pre-law or entering-law students who are not quite sure where they are headed. As a senior at the University of Michigan, I know I want to go into law, but have no idea what to do with it. This guide helped give me some realistic options of what to do with a law degree if I find 80-hour workweeks too unbearable.Anybody interested in law should read this because so many pre-law students (at least those without family members or friends as lawyers) have little idea what happens in a corporate law situation, in a law firm, or in a public interest organization. This book helps distinguish the pros and cons of each option, giving you a breakdown of where you need to go and what you need to do to get where you want to be.I am glad I read this book because it has helped me get a better sense of what exactly there is to do out in the real world that makes use of a law degree."
1,Not worth the money,Very elementary. No real new insight beyond what you can find out at your career services office. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
3,Informative read.,"I thought that the book was very well written and gave much needed information for one whom is pursuing a law career. I thought that the book needed a chapter or two on law schools, yet for the most part the book was helpful."
1,The Worst,"I'm sorry but this is horrible. Every time the book seemed like it was going to tell me something interesting...the next line is ""however, that is beyond the scope of what is covered in this book."" Then what really killed me is in the family law (divorce) section when the author starts talking about how it is illegal for lawyers to have sexual relations with clients which can be real danger when feelings get out of hand. Are you kidding?I was looking for something that delves into the day to day work of lawyers in various practice areas (which seems to be a bit of a secret for whatever reason). This is more like an unorganized, very general review of a few practice areas. I guess you get what you paid for. Should've known when the purchase price was .01."
2,Evil Shaolin vs. Dead Taoist,"I recommend tossing this one. While the movie had all the kung-fu Shaolin bald monks, outlandish Vampires, zombie spirits, and horror schlock, it just couldn't seem to get exciting. Not once did it ever. It's either an incomprehensible DVD or an irritating, inappropriately titled Taoist kung-fu movie.This movie has no plot, no character development, and really no sense of direction or focus at all. It is a D-Movie plain and simple.It's like they just stopped shooting the ending.It was certainly disappointing."
2,It was OK.,"Well, this was definitely a kids' movie. It starts out great, and within the first 10 minutes there's a ""Lost Boys Chinese food"" homage and an attack by dozens of undead that is fought off with Kung Fu and magic.After that, there's a love story, a bunch of arguing between two brothers, and a lot of silly humor. There's nothing scary here and the director cuts too quickly in the fight scenes. My 10-year-old son loved the movie, but it didn't hold my interest at all. I much preferred Ong Bak and Shaolin Soccer to this.Also, the ending is jarring and kills any momentum the movie had. The sequel might make this better, but it doesn't hold up on its own."
2,Rent it first,"The guy above summed it up pretty good, the only thing he forgtot to mention is it is actually a pretty corny movie. Hopping vampires dont get any stupider, the plot stupid and makes no sense, movie just ends out of the blue. the evil dead are only in the first half of the movie then are gone out of know where. Where they come from or or how they just dissapear is unknown. A very common Japanese flick that makes no sense . i have about 7 or japanese flicks and i would say 2 or 3 of them are ok. But thats just IMO. Please rent b4 you buy, I have brought it just about 3 weeks ago on a $5 bootleg and was a perfect copy , just like it was rented from blockbuster.Never would have known it was bootlegged. Rent first buy never."
4,the high point in John Hiatt's career,"Hiatt is in fine voice and he's backed by the amazing Ry Cooder on tasty guitar, Nick Lowe playing solid bass and last but certainly not least the incomparable Jim Keltner on drums. The band is outstanding, playing restrained and supportive, but as much a cohesive unit as any group that Hiatt's played with. The song's are interesting, mature and provide a nice variety within the soul/country/rock genre. You might be familiar with ""A Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" which was a hit for Bonnie Raitt but the other tunes are equally fine on a cd which maintains excellence from start to finish and rates a solid 4+ stars"
5,A Perfect Marriage,"For anyone who has heard this masterpiece... this is a perfect marriage of songwriting, producing and musicians. Combining all the elements of what makes a successful recording came together in 4 magical days. Producer John Chelew coordinated the union of musicians Jim Keltner, Nick Lowe, and Ry Cooder with Hiatt's powerful songs. The result? A classic... bringing out the best sounds from Hiatt ever recorded! To hear a similar perfect union, check out John Chelew's recent marriage of the Blind Boys of Alabama with the likes of Danny Thompson, Charlie Musslewhite, David Lindley and John Hammond... in what is probably the best recording they've ever made."
3,On time and disc works.,The disc seems original but the CD artwork seems like it was printed on so-so paper by a so-so printer. I don't think it's original.
5,Weird and Wonderful,"Weird NJ has been a mainstay of my magazine rack for years, and now Weird NY clues us in to cool spooky and strange things in New York State! And one of my pictures appears on a top righthand page (baby crib grave).Collect all of the ""Weird"" books - even for states you may never visit, they are the coolest."
2,Weird New York,"Great value for a hard cover book with many photos and glossy pages.However while the factual parts of the book are very interesting, the reader entries are a bit inplauible. Most of the reported ghost sightings sound like real BS."
3,"Interesting, but",I would HOPE that when they found the obvious and gory evidence of animal sacrifices in that abandoned building that they immediately contacted the local Humane Society AND the local law authorities.
1,Disappointing,"Got this book for my rail fan pre-schooler who knows all the facts about Casey Jones. I thought this would round out what we know of the true story by providing more information about Sim. Very disappointed. This is some weird, angel/devil story (one very scary picture of the devil's face caused me to close the book!) that really has nothing to do with Casey Jones or Sim Webb. It's a good book if you're into heaven and hell, but we're into trains! Not a book for rail fans."
1,Terrible!,"We've visited the Casey Jones house in Jackson, TN and studied the story a good bit over the years. I was looking for a book that told the Casey Jones story from Sim's point of view. Instead of a fascinating look at at the story from another angle, I got a weird supernatural story that changes the spirit of the true story. I wish I could give it zero stars, but I guess the illustrations do deserve one. This book was a HUGE disappointment."
5,A great classic that has stood the test of time,"This is a truly excellent book, a masterpiece of English literature. Scott has a very clear way of expressing himself which I find very enjoyable. Although the historical details are not all perfectly correct (some minor anachronisms), this does not take anything away from the story. It's a nice old-fashionned romance with chivalrous knights and fair damsels... it's wonderful."
3,Knighthood,I read this all in one setting. King Richard was The Black Knight that Ivanhoe championed. The Knights Templar fought Ivanhoe. A classic tale of knighthood condensed with wonderful illustrations. I liked it.
4,"Informative at times, Interesting at times and well, too slow at times","I'm glad that I read this book and I think that it had many exciting and enjoyable moments. The characters were interesting, for the most part, although I thought it slightly odd that Ivanhoe was hardly the main character of the book. It did have some very slow moments, but like all romantic novels, the character's feelings are talked about for pages and pages. If you know all of this beforehand, it is quite a fun read. I agree with the reviewer that the anti-semitism was brutal throughout the novel but at the end, you felt that there was an enlightenment with Ivanhoe and other characters about the fact that Jewish people are, in fact, PEOPLE! I liked that part of the book very much."
2,This book is pointless!!!,"If your looking for an exciting spine tingling medevil story, this is the book to read. However, is you need to wright a fairly in depth report, steer clear of this novel. Though it is a fun story, there is no symbolism, or any literal elements involved with this book."
1,BOOOOORRRRRRRRING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Forget the book. Rent the video. The book should be about 1/4 the length that it actually is. It's a Classic alright: a Classic Bore.
2,Ivanhoe,"I read this book, and I found that it is a tooooooo long book. I thought that the plot was only a secondary plot... It has too much descriptions, etc. But if you want to read it, go ahead. That's only my opinion, and you can see all the other people that say that it's good."
5,A literary classic,"The book deals with Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe returning from the Crusades to claim his inheritance and his love for a Saxon princess, Rowena. Throughout the novel, we are shown the struggle between Richard the Lion-Hearted and his brother John, introduced to Robin Hood, the reasons for the hatred between Saxons and Normans, and discrimination against the Jews. The majority of characters are intelligent and beautifuly written. Even with Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, even though he is one of the major villans, the reader is left with a sense of sorrow because he also loves Rowena. Highly recommended!"
4,A great knights' romance!!,"This is a great novel about knights in the Middle Age. The characters are attractive. They can insist on their ideals fight for themselves. The dialogues are humorous and interesting. I especially like the descriptions of battles, because they are really vivid and exciting."
4,Ivanhoe: An Eye Popper,"Ivanhoe is a wonderful book. If you like reading about jousting and when Jews and Mormans still fought with each other, you will love reading this book. Some spots you may have to go over to get the full effect of the book, but I am pretty sure you will think the book is an enchantment when you read the book."
2,Could have been much better,"The book has too much description of everything. I was hoping for a lot of suspense and action, but all I saw was just a bunch of words that just didn't make me say, ""WOW!"""
4,Classic historical fiction,"The book is set after the Norman invasion of Britain. It revolves around a large number of events such as the usurpation of the throne of Richard the Lion-Heart by his brother, the struggle for Saxon resistance against the Normans, the kidnapping of a beautiful girl from a Jewish family, the knights tournament and the struggle between the hero and a Templar Knight (the main villain of the book). There are castle sieges, tournaments, duels, jousts and the descriptions of obsession, greed and tyranny. A true melting pot of events with heroic characters - a great read."
5,BORING????,"I hear the word boring used often when reviewing a book. In an age where we are bombarded with so much sensory stimulation of all kinds, reading classic literature can seem rather dull. The key is to put the book in the context in which it was written and avoid critiquing it to death. Read Ivanhoe with an open mind."
1,terrible,this product is terrible. the studio graphical tools are very poor and smp support is not so good.
3,Not the best.,"Most of the Ospery titles have been very good. But this one was lacking something. It needed to cover more of the pilots who flew the planes rather than the plane. There were some BOB aces that weren't mention who did quite well.The Ospery series is one of the best available, and well worth looking up. This book though doesn't cover the aces well enough."
2,The content missed the meaning of the title.,I found that Mr. Price spent more time on tactics and the aircraft itself than the pilots that flew it to 5 victories. I must admit I'm a bit bias having read Mr. Weal's BF109D/E aces book beforehand and was therefore hoping Mr. Price's book would follow the same writing style. I was disappointed. There had to be more than the 10 pilots Mr. Price focused on that achieved 5 victories in this marque of Spitfire.
3,Hurricane Aces Series far superior,The Hurricane Aces 39/40 book was superior to the Spitfire Mark I/II Aces. The Hurricane Aces book has more pages and there was more emphasis on the aces particulary about how many aces were kiled and/or wounded. There was too much technical data on the Spitfire and one chapter was totally to two of the Spitfire aces. Should have been more information about how many Spitfire Aces there were and how many were killed or wounded during 1939/41 period.
2,Returned them,"I gave 2 stars because the shoes are cute and I received them quickly. Those are the only positive things I can say about them. I ordered the size that was supposed to fit my feet - the shoes were too short. Had I kept them and worn them, my big toe would have poked a hole in the tips of the shoes - probably sooner rather than later. The knit upper is thin giving the shoes a very cheap look - I could see my skin through the weave. There was absolutely no arch support - none. I've had better arch support in a bedroom slipper. To be fair, I have flat feet; if you have a normal arch - meaning one that does not require orthotics - then this shoe might work for you. I also think that these shoes are overpriced given what appears to be mediocre quality. Suffice it to say, I sent them back almost as quickly as I received them."
1,1 out of 5,"This movie had no suspense, no thrills. Nothing. The plot was generic and went by like a lousy Sci-Fi flick of yesteryear. If you are looking for a good movie that takes place in an office building simply purchase Die Hard."
5,GREAT MOVIE! WONDERFUL SUSPENSE THRILLS AND CHILLS!,"This movie is great when it comes to horror and suspence. Kathleen Quinlan stars in this chilling story of a building managment executive trapped in a high-rise building with a psychopathic killer. Working late one night, Marianne Marshall (Quinlan) discovers all the exits locked and the high-tech security system disabled in her 65-story office building. Suddenly a knife lashes out of the dark, and so begins a deadly game of cat and mouse in a labyrinth of corridors and empty offices. Bruce Abbott co-stars in this spine-tingling suspense thriller from writer/director Fred Walton (When a Stranger Calls). This movie also stars Katy Boyer and Ben Loggins. The Los Angeles Times calls it ""A tightly wrought thriller..."" If you are looking for good suspense, get this movie. Recommended."
5,This movie is great!!,"I've seen this movie about a million times, and it still feels like I'm watching it for the first time every time I watch it. You can never get bored with this one... I love it!!!!"
5,wonderful,such a great movie takes me back years ago....just recently bought it again cant wait to watch it again
3,Big Shiny Cars Review,"Pinmonkey is a great group, and I love their ""Pinmonkey"" release, but Big Shiny Cars is somewhat of a let down. Music is good, but not the same calibre as Pinmonkey or Speak No Evil."
2,Packaging is not Factory!!,"I was disappointed when the items came shipped in unsealed individual plastic bags. My expectation was that new meant they would come in original store packaging. I have no way to know if the items are truly new, how they were manufactured, and if they passed the scrutiny of lead testing."
3,Average little-known character SVH book,"This is a middle of the road Sweet Valley High book. I personally prefer the books that are centered around the twins or the other main characters such as Lila, Bruce, Todd, Enid or Steven. There's usually a book thrown in about some random Sweet Valley High student, and this is one of them. This time a student named Sara is embarassed by her reform-school twin, Tim. Sara has made up all these flattering stories about Tim to her classmates, thinking he will stay back east where he belongs and no one will really know the truth. Of course the paroled Tim wants to live with his mom and sis in Sweet Valley, so he shows up one day and befriends Liz Wakefield (which is a requirement in Sweet Valley). Sara stays away from Tim, but Liz is there to make sure they are one happy family again."
2,Not a Sony,"Got the battery, but it isn't a Sony. Doesn't hold its charge any longer than my 5 yr. old battery....."
3,"Ok, cheap","Good price when I bought it, battery life is adequate, I was expecting better.Get what you pay for"
4,"Great Product, Terrible Customer Service","I was skeptical at first, but after playing with Battery 3 for a few hours I was blown away. All of the drums sound authentic and the cell matrix greatly improved my workflow. If you're looking for drums, this is the software for you. If you ever have to contact the Native Instrument customer service, via telephone, I'll just tell you ahead of time that their technical support is terrible."
5,Great Product Great Sounds!,"I own this product and frequently write music with Virtual Drumline, Sibelius 5 and Kontakt 3. Another user review stated it doesn't function properly, I had that problem also but when speaking with (the very helpful) tech support the told me just to install the updates with the Natvie Instrument service center, logged in, installed updates, problem fixed, program works great and has an extensive library, you just have to make sure that the program is up to date, as with most programs. I love the percussion sounds and extensive Drum Set library included and it has made writing percussion parts with Sibelius that much more pleasing."
2,THE WORST tech support I've ever experienced.,"Tech support is unbearable.. I wasn't able to install it.. I can't UNINSTALL it.. it's in my computer taking up CPU.. and Native Instruments Tech support is HORRIFYINGLY TERRIBLE.. We've shot e-mails back and forth for a week.. The e-mails go nowhere because they keep asking my to send them screenshots of things I already explained three e-mails ago.. I tried calling, I got a very rude tech guy who told me to only e-mail from now on, and wasn't helpful at all.. These people like to sell there products for top dollar... but they don't like to be responible for them if something goes wrong.. I recomend everybody buy their virtual instruments elsewhere.. I will.. There are plenty of other drum samplers out there.. I'm giving it two stars because I did use this product for a couple of years on professional recordings but upon switching computers all this BS happened.. it ain't worth it.."
5,Testimonial,"Fran's journey is an exquisite example of one's ability to connect the mind and the body with the Divine for healing that is total, whole, and complete. her story is empowering and I am honored to have been a participant along her path."
4,Really Fun Skiing Game,"I played the trial version (main version not yet available) and it was very entertaining. The menu system is relatively crude, but intuitive enough that you get it pretty quickly. The controls are very responsive and it really does give a sense of going down the slopes at breakneck speed."
4,"Tour in the Tropics, or, Guam is Good","I first encountered this little cartoon booklet when my ex-wife purchased it while we were stationed at Andersen AFB, Guam, from 1960-1962. The cartoons in it very accurately describe the experiences of the military families who were stationed there during that time. I've been looking for a copy for many years, and I'd come to the conclusion that they all had dissapeared forever. To my good fortune, a copy appeared for sale on Amazon, and I purchased it immediately. It's brought back many fond memories of my ""Tour in the Tropics."" Yes, ""Guam was Good."""
5,A must read!,"This book was inspiring and very helpful to me, as I am preparing to serve as a hospice chaplain. It made me smile and brought tears to my eyes. I believe everyone should read this book because at some point, each of us is going to experience death or hospice situations."
3,Justice for Texas Justice,"Until this book the best book on the Texas Rangers was he Webb book. Utley is a modern historian and those who prefer to live in the past in their culture will be disappointed in this book. It is a modern rendition for modern readers. That is not to say it is weak in research or in bringing the past to life. What I mean is this book is written in the now and doesn't adhere to the old rules of whitewash.A major benfit of this work is the ointroduction to many of Edmund J. Davis, cast as the worst governor in Texas history. A Reconstruction governor responsible for the formation of the Texas Rangers as a force to enforce Reconstruction policy as he saw it and fight the elements that became the Ku Klux Klan.This is a refreshing and interesting work on the taming of the old west."
3,"Great Music, Ridiculous Lyrics....As Usual.","I'm a loyal Vai fan, so I always buy his new releases, no matter what. This album follows the pattern of the last few discs: a handful of great instrumentals, plus 5-6 ""songs."" I tend to fast-forward through his lyrics, until I hit the solos.If there is a God, I wish he'd tell Steve to stop singing. I love the guy, and he's got a decent voice. But damn, those lyrics are ridiculous.On a positive note, his compositional skills continue to astound."
3,Steve has done much better,"This album has some good points. Building the Church and K'm Pee Du Wee are my favorites. Firewall is an ok vocal song, but this album has some crappy stuff too. Dying For Your Love plain out sucks. Gai Gai is lame as well. Some of Steve's choices on solos make no musical sense, even for Vai's standards, and are full of emotionless wanking. I love Steve Vai, and have pretty much all his stuff. He needs to experiment less, and give us his good stuff. It seems to me that not much effort was put into this one."
2,Another hole in the water,"For me it's very hard to say bad about Vai's works (because I'm feeling related to him from when he was young and playing with ""uncle"" Frank), but this work is wrong. His guitar mood is similar, too similar to the past, so I can't see it as a new direction in Vai's opera. It's rather a stop or an exit from the majestic road he has tracked. I hope he starts soon with a new form of music."
1,terrible,"This is an experimental album. Takin a different road, doing something new, being creative, coming up with something never heard of before...etc.ok, now that is the obvious, so is it really good? In my opinion, it's terrible! After listening to it, I was not in a hurry to play any of the songs i've just heard. Matter of fact, I still haven't listen to it after the first sit through of this cd. it's really that bad! yes some of the songs takes the same setting from previous songs! LAME! some of the drum beats shouldn't even be considered ""music."" The singing sounds like a a grown 40 yr. dad singing in the shower!yes yes steve is among the best in guitar playing, but he puts out crap musically this time. There's nothing in this cd that hooks you into the songs! Just a mash of WEIRD beats and patterns that no one really does in their work!I felt like i really wasted my money. this is NOT rock n roll !!!This is yoga music!!!!!!damn you steve!"
2,"Steve, please stop singing!","I am like the rest of most people in here. I believe Steve Vai is as talented as any guitar player ever, ever! Nobody shreds faster or can get the same sounds out of an Ibanez. HOWEVER, he has 1/10 the musical intelligence of Joe Satriani. I can listen to Satriani anytime, each album is unique and exciting. However, with Vai, you get these hit and miss CDs with some creative playing and some awful heavy metal tracks featuring terrible singing. Here is hoping that Steve gets some direction, so his musical genius can be recorded for the ages."
4,"Very fun, good outing","I really like SV. His music is fun and always gives me a laugh when I watch, see or listen to his solo's.I tend to like the strangeness of the Zappa influenced work. I tend to agree with the other reveiwer who wrote that there are '2 Steve Vai's' but there is a lot to enjoy in this CD... and I think there are plenty of hooks, esspecially in the opening track.Hooks are nice for songs, and I love a good hook as much as anyone else, but I give SV a boost on this recording because he is bravely going where not to many go... and lets face it... songs are mostly now built around plastic hook on plastic sounding hook... it is true that SV is more meat than hook but good meat is good meat.I give it 4 stars, since I have other SV's that I like better..But there is still nothing wrong with music that is not pop fluff."
2,Destroying a legacy... one disc at a time,"I stopped buying Steve Vai's stuff for awhile. It was too out there for anyone that wasn't demented. I thought I'd pop back in seeing as Sheehan was back in the mix and see what was up... well, $15 is an expensive coaster. Yea got me Steve, I admit it.The production is thin and tinny. The direction is profoundly silly. The playing is good but lacks any sort of form to make it special. Think: ""Firegarden"" but twice as muddled.I'm not sure if the thought is that ""some day"" the world will see how brillant this stuff is but I highly doubt it, that's about as likely as a true Mad Max style future. It's an odd feeling to LOVE Joe Satriani, think Steve is the better guitarist, and yet NOT want to listen to Steve. It has a lot to do with what is being recorded and not the talent involved.And for the Love of God, stop singing. Please??"
4,Are you kidding?,"In response to the the negative and some positive reviews here I have to say most of you have no idea what you are talking about and are not qualfied to judge this recording. You may have an opinion but based on what?I'll take one song off this recording and explain what I mean.K'm-Pee-Du-Wee is a blues tune.The I chord is held for 8 measures instead of the usual 4. Then the IV chord is held for 4 measures instead of the usual 2. The remainder follows the traditional way for the most part.This is not a new idea but one that Vai uses to great interest. He is not taking a blues approach and he is certainly not a jazzer using loads of chord substitutions as well. His is more modal and that is his forte.He tansforms a blues progression into something else altogether with unique tone, chops and humour."
3,"Should be 2, but I just love Vai too much.","OK,,,so I have been a loyal and loving fan of Vai since his early, early days; we are talking ealry 80's when I was just a lad. I have bought every album and been to every show in Chicago (and other areas). I anxiously awaited this album, popped it in and was deflated like a balloon, hissing all over the place with annoyance. There isnt a sound, lick or riff on here that he hasnt done before? I just dont understand what has happened? Has Vai lost his edge? Has he jammed everything that his guitar can offer him? There is no argument that he is still amazing on the fretboard, but there are no surprises here. Maybe he should put out an acoustic album? I hope this is but a speed bump and his next effort will be a full, furious rip roaring sound explosion."
2,Noisy album,"Man I love Steve Vai, and I know he's one of if not the best technically greatest guitar players ever. He also knows more about music theory than I will ever in my lifetime. But there comes a point when the knowledge hinders usefulness. Yes, he is playing like a spider on crack, yes, he's using unique scales and patterns, but it all sounds so useless! I'd rather hear him sweep for 30 minutes and sit there and marvel than here a bunch of guitar synth noise backed by other tracks that make the whole thing chaotic. Steve Vai did a lot of the guitar work for the movie Crossroads. That's the type of music I wanna hear from him. Music that's catchy and at the same time, intuitive, creative and ridiculously hard to put your finger on. He needs to go back to the basics, he's too out there for me right now."
1,I was really disappointed in this one.,"I have to say that this is the only regular album Steve Vai has put out that I couldn't listen to. The songs had good ideas, but his lead guitar work ruined it for me. A lot of it sounded thrown together, and seemed more like showing off how many crazy notes he could put to gether than something that was orchestrated. I've been a long time fan of Vai (since maybe '95) and I have every album he's put out. This is the only one I had to get rid of. I don't think it's a lack of talent... just nothing grabbed me on it. Try to find it used, if you're gonna buy it. I sold mine for 1/3 what I paid for it."
2,Not again.....,"I'm sorry to say, I was a huge fan of Vai, but not any more. I'm just tired. I can't listen anymore to the same recipes of the same songs played using different scales and tempos. I know, he's not just asc-descending scales in tempos, but you know what I mean...Where are those days when warfare and firegarden came out and I was standing stunned by the melodies and the composing abilities of this superhero?I don't know, if I haven't ever heard of this man's giant masterpieces of the past, perhaps, I would've enjoyed this album. There are a couple of nice things here and there. But probably nothing more than that."
2,"Clumsily written, but the book still remains touching.","The original concept behind this book was a good one....one would like to think of Diana's last days as warm and happy, basking in the sun and in the warmth of a new love. The problem with this ""wanna be warm and fuzzy book"" is the authors ever present droning on about himself, (his self-glorification at being the best butler ever put on this earth made me tear up in angst). Rene Delorm is annoying at best."
5,Great Book,When I read this book I found that I couldn't put it down I cried all the way through it It was one of the best books ever written about two precious people
2,Diana & Dodi: A Lust Story,"A supremely sycophantic book ""written"" by Dodi's boy Friday (butler, valet, masseure, personal trainer, gofer...). All the perfumed prose cannot hide the skeleton of the story: two people who'd seen each other for about six weeks, dated seriously for about four of those, and were united in their stuffed animals and living well off of other people's money. No mention is made of Dodi's fiance, who was stashed on a nearby yacht during the first two weeks of D&D's six week ""love"" affair. This is definitely the Fayed public version of what happened between mid July and August 31, 1999."
2,dated with no real value,This book is so dated as to be of little use to anyone interested in the subject. At best its a good retrospective on the situation leading up to the US invasion of Iraq. But so much has happened since then as to make the book largely irrelivant.Certain of the contributors to the book have unhealthy ties to Kurdish groups and the Kurdish cause. The inclusion of material from those sources undercuts the credibility of the rest of the book.
5,not my old spyware program,"Just bought a new Dell because I was told my old one was running slow because of spyware corruption and doubling the memory on my old one wouldn't really speed it up--so I wanted to protect the new computer from spyware and bought spyware doctor for $30 dollars. I ran it on my old machine and it removed 200 separate items (cookies, trojans, etc.)that my old spyware program never found. It catches new things daily on my new machine. And the speed of my operating system is great. So for $30 bucks, I think tbhis is a great investment not only to keep your machine running smoothly but to protect against identity theft."
2,2 stars is being kind,"i bought this 2 years ago and it was o.k. it worked, i upgraded and it slowed my computer down so much (new high end lattop 1 gig memory ) it stops, i check task manager and its taking up 100% of my cpu ,memory ect. its finds the spyware fine, sometimes 30 or more a day but why let it on my computer in the first place ???????there is better and much cheaper products out there that wont hog your computer to a crawl and wont let spyware on your system so why not buy them ???? my last upgrade of spyware doctor folks"
1,Worst PC program I've ever used,"I'm not sure I understand those individuals who are not having problems with this Product. It, as many have said is lacking in quality, and if you care how your system performs, don't install Spyware. I had two problems. My system would not shut down and as most others, ran extremely slow. There is no support for this product as published. I corresponded with the Support Group 5 times and not once did they understand what I said."
1,Resource Hog With Big Problems,"This is the worst security program I have ever had the misfortune to install on my computer. It is inconceivable to me that this program was rated highly by PC World. Each time I boot up my computer, it takes forever to load, and it prevents me from doing anything until it has finally finished whatever it is doing. After the program eventually loads, it causes a terrific slowdown in my computer, and the scans frequently result in lockups. I've turned off the anti virus protection in the program and otherwise adjusted the settings, but nothing seems to help. I recently downloaded the newer version of the program, hoping that the 2007 version would run more smoothly, but it was no better. Today, I finally gave up and uninstalled the program, and everything is back to normal. If you are thinking about this program, forget it."
2,Plugged up,"This product did locate spyware, but I can get better results with Ad-Aware. I bought this product, however it clogged up my system. I had to remove it and re-install it. When I was notified that upgrades were available, I could not get upgrades. I finally removed it from my computer. Ad-Aware is FREE and works great!"
3,"Fine Job of Spycatching, but....","This software works great on a one-user account machine. On a machine with multiple users, it was very buggy. It didn't show it was running in the system tray on accounts other than the one is was installed under and it brought things to a grinding halt if you clicked the desktop icon on these accounts. Recommended for one; not recommeneded if multiple accounts exist on a machine."
3,"This is not an authorized album, just for her fans","When Elis Regina left Polygram Records, there were some parts of recordings, tracks which were not approved by their composers (like ""Valsa Rancho"" by Francis Hime) and even by Elis herself.Fortunately for her fans and unnecessarily for quality reasons, Polygram Records has decided to issue this neglectable album."
4,super value,"The Aaron Neville syrup aside, the other tunes on this disc are great. Fiyo On The Bayou is worth the price of admission alone. Hey Pocky Way is a great groove as well. This is the Neviiles album for me as it takes me back to the shows ion the late 80s and early 90s when all these songs were concert staples. Turn it up loud- even your neighbors will like it."
2,only 25 mins or so of music!,"there are only 8 songs, mildy mediocre ones at best, the total run time is around 25 minutes...on that basis alone it is not worth the 6 bucks."
2,Died quickly,"With this battery you get what you paid for. It died within 6 months. No short cuts, if your phones battery goes dead, just get another phone, good batteries cost almost as much as the phone and cheap batteries like this one aren't worth the trouble."
1,Background hiss ruins an otherwise good product. SSSSSSS...,"SSSSSSSSSSSSS... Got this, it was exactly what I needed, and sounded good - except for that continual, annoying BACKGROUND HISS. Paid the extra bucks to have them assemble it, so it was not my doing. Should have returned it, but kept trying to ignore the hiss, finally tossed it. SSSSSSSSSSSSS..."
2,Ehhhh,I received the cologne today with moderate hopes that it would be worth the cash dished out. I was sadly mistaken. It has an extremely strong at first which is a huge turn off. I have an extensive cologne collection and this is one of my least favorites.
1,LOOK ELSEWHERE,"This product smells OKAY. JUST OKAY. There is NOTHING spectacular or ""wowing"" about this scent. It's also not long-lasting. ONE THING: It is VERY HARD to spray! IT GETS JAMMED EVEN! I HAD TO STOP USING IT AT HALF BOTTLE. IT JUST WOULD NOT SPRAY!"
1,stinks/old,"I got this perfume in hopes it would smell good.I was dissappointed it stinks ,smells old or something,would not recommend this product for anyone who wants to smell good."
5,FCUK Cologne - Must have.,This is one of my favorite scents out there. The product came very quickly through the mail. Got it for an excellent price.
1,A strange title,"Dear Sirs,I was astonished to see the title: Fluency and It's Teaching. Is there a joke here that I am not getting? Why is it ""It's"" rather than ""Its""? Perhaps because it sounds the same and in a fluency situation it does not matter? It's puzzling all the same (at least to me).I am very curious to find out the reason. And then, but only then, I might read the book."
1,not worth it,the measurements where not clearly marked and very hard to read. I was very disappointed by that. my child does like the soft tip of the dropers.
2,DVD broken -- I have to pay for shipping,"As several other users have posted, the DVD on this unit stopped reading DVD's within 6 weeks of purchase. Now _I_ have to remove the television from its wall mount, pack up a fragile, flat-screen television for shipping, and pay for shipping to a Toshiba. I am now crossing my fingers that they will fix it, instead of, e.g., breaking it, or doing nothing to it and sending it back to me. Had I known, I would easily have paid an extra $150 or so for a different brand."
5,A really useful book on stylistics.,I teach at a University and I regularly use this book for my own research as well as for classes. This new edition is even better than the last one.
4,Still regal after all these years,"I got this Princess Leia as part ofStar Wars Episode 6 Collectible Tin.Princess Leia is a well made figure. The overall sculpt is good, with added details such as trences and fabric skirt. However, this figure is taller than later versions of Leia found since the Saga Collection.This figure has:- swivel head, shoulders and hips, but- no articulation on elbows, wrists, waist, knees or ankles.This figure has great likeness, but poor articulation. Since she just need to stand regal for the Ewoks celebration, articulation should not be an issue. I'm satisfied with it."
2,Not my favorite,"This is not my favorite hair coloring product. It's extrememly messy, takes forever to rinse the glop out, and it leaves your hair dull looking and feeling like straw. Also, for me, the color change was far too subtle, even after an hour. There is, however, a LOT of product for the money--you could easily do two applications from one box for long hair or more for short hair. If you want safe, SUBTLE color/highlights, this might be your thing. Just use a conditioner, especially one that gives shine to the hair. (See my review for the red shade)"
4,not very effective,"I would much rather use a purely natural product like this over chemical based ones, but it wasn't very effective. I have light brown hair and was hoping this would add more warmth to it than it did. Maybe I was just being too cautious in my color choice. I followed the directions exactly and did 3 strand tests. With the 3rd strand test, I added ginger and cayenne because the other 2 tests resulted in no difference at all. I left the product on for an hour, randomly applying heat with a hair dryer. In the end, it added only minimal warmth, which could have been from the cayenne, and that quickly faded. I am not saying this is a bad product, but that if your hair color is similar to the color you choose, perhaps consider choosing the next shade up."
5,In The Right Place/Gumbo,Exceedingly high sonic integrity. The condition of the CD was impeccable. Still trying to garner all of the Mobile Fidelity Catalogue on CD. Thank You.
3,Definitely not Weathertech quality.,"They are molded to fit the floorboard design of our Escape, which should stop them from sliding, but they have holes in them for carpet anchors. To me that's just a spot for water to leak into my carpet. The worst part is, the driver side floor mat was not molded to go under the gas peddle, leaving the carpet there unprotected. We have Weathertech mats in our 2010 Edge and they are by far a better designed product. Unfortunately, Weathertech doesn't make mats for the Escape or I would return these and order the Weathertech ones."
1,Seller nasty email,"I contacted the seller, due to the fact that I ordered Ice age the meltdown for my son xbox. When my son opened his present on Christmas it didn't work for his xbox 360. That's when we realized that the product is for the xbox and not the xbox 360, so I contacted the seller and they said they could not reimburse me for the product because my son had opened it. So I said well I just received this product on 12/23/09 obviously it's still a new game. They responded in a very nasty email (how unprofessional), saying it was my error bla bla bla. I will never order from hitgaming ever again.Angelina Santiago"
4,"Heavy reading, but very insightful","This book is not for the faint of heart. It delves heavily into the world of economic theory and policy, which may seem daunting to the layman. This is not a fun read. It quotes facts, statistic and theorizes in such a manner that everything must be absorbed before continuing. Yet it is a masterpiece in analyzing the workings of the Hungarian socialist system and why it ended. It examines the key difficulties in establishing workable socialism and follows the various reforms and 5-year plans that marked Hungarian Communist history. The book does not deal with historical events directly, but rather with the economic decisions that defined the direction the country took. A must read for all serious students of Hungarian Communist and post-Communist history."
4,Just a bit too big for my 2-year-old,This is just a bit too big for my 2-year-old grand-daughter. But she is improvising until she grows into it. Seems to be good quality product so far.
4,"Who doesn't love to bounce on a big ""balloon""!?!",My 3yro (90th percentile for heighth) is still a little short for this but he loves it none the less.
1,Don't buy this ball - The stars weaken its integrity,"We bought this for my daughter who's birthday was November 1. It never fully inflated to the stated diameter. I tried to get as close as possible and eventually it was stretched so tight that the stars started spliting. Two days before Christmas it finally got a hole in it beyond repair. Not even 2 months did this thing last. I even wrote the company, because overall we were happy with the thickness and seeming durability that we bought one of the larger ones for our older daughter that has none of the problems this one does, but they have as yet not responded to any of my queries. I would recommend getting one without the stars as it seems to weaken the integrity of the product."
5,Great indoors fun when the weather is bad,"My 5-year-old granddaughter loves bouncing around the house on this ball, especially when it's too cold, windy or wet to play outside. And since development of her gross motor skills is delayed, I'm thinking this toy provides some therapeutic value for her as well."
5,W O W WORD FOR BETTER THAN A MASTERPIECE?,"I must say kudos to Frankie B for his review for I cannot extrapolate more except to say: this remaster is so on target - as this project was when it was released. In some ways, it sounds better today then the year it was released. We can listen and almost hear the lack of brilliance that we have not heard in the years since the original release - and nothing is as pure, honest and rocking than this Donna release. It may be discofied, however I stand by my initial feeling as a kid - this is a rock and roll masterpiece. The remastering is frightening - the clarity makes you TURN IT UP and it sounds great LOUD LOUD LOUD. Remember in the 80s - artists would always have printed on their sleeves ""Play It Loud"" ? Well - Donna Summer did not need that on this originally or certainly upon this remastered release. However, I am telling you - play this LOUD and relish in the aural confection of the genius of Donna, Pete and GiorgioEXHILERATING."
4,more expensive,"is the same than bad girls & the dance collection put together with bad girls , witout with your love & with on the radio. a demo version of a song that is shorter than the real one i'm not interested on..the songs in the 2nd CD are all full lenght 12"" versions"
2,I work hard for my money too!,"This CD was just released for sale here in Toronto for 3 times the price of Donna Summer's ""The Dance Collection"".After listening to the ultimate ""Macarthur Park Suite"" track, my eardrums were in pain. This is an acoustically engineered disaster with shrill highs. I listened to the same track on her ""The Dance Collection"" CD and the sound quality is much better and at a cheaper price.Strangely, the other dance tracks like ""On the Radio"" and ""Bad Girls"" on CD #2 sound far superior.If you're only interested in 12"" remixed value for your dollar, then ""The Dance Collection"" CD is the preferred way to go.I'm still hoping for an exclusive 12"" remix and 12"" extended single ""Dance Anthology Collection"" CD from her.I won't hold my breath."
2,Memory is better than reality...,"Although I give props to Donna Summer as an artist and for having a truly beautiful voice, after playing this album for the first time in over 20 years I realized there's a reason everybody hates disco: for the most part it's just not very good music. And while a couple of songs are okay, none of them can be called timeless by any means. I didn't expect my wife and kids to get this music, so imagine my surprise when I didn't get it either.3 stars for the quality of the re-master, although that isn't so great either: you may be better off and save money finding this on vinyl. The album is a must-have if you are having a ""remember disco?"" party; otherwise look elsewhere for your nostalgic fix."
3,sounds excellent,"GREAT QUALITY IN SOUND. NO PROBLEMS. BUT ON MAC ARTHURS PARK SUITE. THEY DELETED 11 SECONDS OF THE SONG ON (ONE OF A KIND) THE CLAP SEEMS SHORTER AND AT THE END VERSE OF (HEAVEN KNOWS)WHERE SHE SAYS: SO COME ON DOWN HEAR MY CRY. IS NOT THERE. THIS IS THE ONLY CHANCE TO GET THIS MASTERPIECE REMASTERED AND THEY BLEW IT. THE 12"" COLLECTION HAS THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF IT. I THINK LAST DANCE ALSO SOUNDS DIFFERENT. BUT NOT FOR SURE ON THAT. I HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPED YOU."
4,Great Album,"I do enjoy Donna Summer's many albums from the '70's. Bad Girls is a great album because it has many different sounds. It's not just disco. It's a mixture of rock, disco, r&b and electronic music. I gave it four stars because of my amazon player's format of not playing tracks back to back. There is a gap between each song when sometimes it's suppose to be seamless. I also gave it four stars because the Mac Aruther Park Suite is not the original length. It has been edited."
3,Just the doc of an era!,"This is a live recording, a not very good sound recording but a splendid doc of those times when simply dozens of brilliant new singers and composers were born to the musical scene in Brazil. Reuniting the master Elis Regina with ""sambista"" Jair Rodrigues brought a tremendous commercial result. This is the very first of a 3-disc live series of ""2 na Bossa"", the Elis Regina/Jair Rodrigues collaboration. The ensemble consists of a trio piano-bass-drums. The ambience is of a huge crazy audience. I love this album because I have lived those times. It is really the CD doc of a great era of Brazilian music, the great 60 decade. To lesser the album quality, I note the exagerated use of medleys (in Portuguese, they say it ""pout-porri"" from French)."
3,Came out a nice shade of purple,"The color isn't bad. I just did it a few days ago but like it so far. I had some pink still left in my hair when I put it in, so mine turned sort of a plum color with a blend of purple. People that have seen it, like it so far. I may put another layer on soon to see if I can darken it up a bit. Not sure yet since I am kind of curious to see what it fades out to."
4,2 colors for the price of one,I dyed my hair purple for about a month. This is the best purple I've ever used. It looks purple in yellow light and blue in lights that I don't know the name of. It looked blue in my refrigerator light and classroom lights. I recommend using L'Oreal EverPure Sulfate-free color care system as it did not fade my hair! It stayed a bright purple for over a week before it started to become dull.This doesn't smell bad and it feels like children's finger paint. It does stain so be careful not to spill or drip any on any surface. I am definitely going to dye my hair purple again.
2,fades too fast.,"not too happy with it. I know Manic Panic products don't last that long usually, but this purple is worse than most. My hair currently is 'atomic turqoise' and 'ultra violet', and I've had it that way for over a month. I havent had to re-dye the blue at all (it has faded, but it's still looking pretty good), but I've had to re-dye the purple THREE TIMES. it fades to a ugly greyish color after Like three or four hair washes. Not a product I would recommend."
1,Turned BLUE not PURPLE!,"I've used this dye multiple times hoping that everytime I use it, I will obtain the results that everyone else seems to get. But NO! every single time that I have used this dye, the result is the same. i end up with bright BLUE hair without a hint of violet anywhere! i don't understand why this keeps happening, I've put it over bleached hair and i keep getting the same result. The only time it turned remotely purple was when i put it over pink strands of hair. I am so frustrated with this product. Will not be buying this color again."
2,Fades too quickly,Eep. I should have listened to my friends and not used this on bleached hair. It fades quickly and it fades to a sickly grey color on bleached hair in just a couple of weeks. On dark hair it simply fades to nothing in a few washes. Have had much better results with another brand.
2,Try if you want to,The color turned out a lot darker then it looks. The dye is very thick; because of this I had to use my hands to get it to spread evenly. The dye came out in two washes.
4,Handy Tool,"Took it out of the box, charged it and away I went. Still haven't run out of battery and used it to take a ton of outlet covers off, window coverings and light switches. I am remodeling a house and needed something in between a drill and a hand screwdriver for little jobs. This tool as proven very useful. If you plan on replacing a lot of outlets, installing a ceiling fan, or general work around the house this is a great tool. My only wish is that I bought it before Christmas as I could have used it to put together the ton of ""plastic"" my kids got from Santa."
3,"Usefull, but could be improved!","This is a nice little tool that you can keep in a kitchen drawer or your car for a pretty long time and not worry about it loosing its charge. I really like the small compact size. It also has a decent accessory set with it.Here is where I think it needs improvement:*No variable control (on or off only)*The speed is pretty slow*No clutch which makes it difficult tighten any screw on with any accuracy w/o taking out another manual screw driver to finish it off.*not enough power to tackle even a 1-1/4 wood screw into a 2x** You cant lock the shaft (I would want this to finish tightening a screw that this unit doesnt have enough power for)I realize this tool is not designed to replace a larger cordless drill and this does have many uses, but with todays technology B&D; can do better."
4,How Powerful Is it?,"My main concern before deciding to buy this cordless screwdriver was whether it would be powerful enough. After years of hacking together Ikea chipboard furniture I was confronted with a Crate and Barrel oak bookshelf. Getting the screws into the oak by hand was painfully difficult and I was starting to strip the screws before they were half in. I couldn't tell from the reviews here whether it would have enough juice for the job and ended up buying this in blind hope.Happily, the LI3000 did the job beautifully! The bookshelves were up in about a 10th the time it would have taken otherwise. How powerful is it then? Strong enough to get inch long wood screws into solid oak. I think thats probably about the limit of its capability."
3,Glad I didn't pay anything for this thing!,"I've had this screwdriver for several months. It's a pretty useless thing. It does drive screws, but very slowly. No clutch, no speed control. $40 should buy more in this day and age. I tried to think of somebody to give this to. There wasn't anyone I could think of because lack of speed control and clutch is a serious disadvantage to both the experienced and the inexperienced. I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 stars because a few other people are happy with it. That must mean that somehow I am missing something good about this tool. I think you should save your money and put it towards a more versatile tool. After all, its price is already 1/3 the price of a Bosch."
1,It broke,I loaned this from a friend in like-new condition. I used it once on 6 screws and then it stopped. It now only moves counter-clockwise.
2,"Terrible screwdriver, but comes with a million bits",Buy this for the set of bits and throw out the screwdriver. The screwdriver does not have enough power and only has one speed. You cannot adjust how quickly it turns by pressure on the trigger. This yields tons of stripped screws. It also does not have enough power to screw in anything by soft woods or pre-drilled holes. This gets two stars for an amazing array of bits. I use the bits all the time in my Dewalt driver.
3,Lots of torque = needs a clutch,"If this thing had a clutch it would be my favorite tool. The battery lasts forever. It has surprisingly good torque for something so small. It is small so it gets into tight places. It is so simple even my kids can use it. However without a clutch you can only use it to do so much. I have to carry a set of regular screw-drivers with me to snug things down, which rather defeats the point."
2,no power,The drill is a wonderful idea because it fits my small hand and is light enough that my arthritic wrists can handle it. But it was not powerful enough to drive in screws for the first two projects I tried it on.
4,Bk. & Decker Cordless LI3000,"It comes in handy for all the little jobs around the house. I bought 3, for my husband & son-in- laws. I think they are real cute. My husband has used it on several jobs around the house. It would be 5 stars if it came with a little carrying bag or case."
2,Was a bad choice for me,"I bought it to drive screws into a 2x4 where I was going to put a clothing rod up. It didn't work at all for this. It did help me put small screws into another project. However, I am very dissapointed. I feel I wasted my money."
4,Power Screwdriver,"It is a great product. only flaw I could say is, it isn't varible speed. But it is handy and comfortable to use. Thanks"
3,update: 3/13/10,"Alas, my experience with B&D; has been confirmed once again: the trigger switch now is failing. Occasionally it works, sometimes in reverse only, sometimes both ways, usually balky and tempermental. It is now an unreliable tool that must be replaced.Update 12/31/12. I have two of these, one in each of two houses, and use them occasionally. Have had them for years, say, 5-6. Despite my dislike for B&D; tools generally, these darn things are still working just fine. Still good torque (for what they are, of course). I keep them plugged into the charger but they still seem to run strong on each occasional job. You can use hex-base drill bits, too, although you must back them out carefully, gently holding the bit in the driver to keep it from pulling out."
5,great all-around home use,"I've had this tool for a few years now and I absolutely love it, I just never got around to writing a review sooner.It does what it's supposed to do for lightweight jobs around the home.I've used it for cabinet (several of them) and desk assembly, curtain rods,fitness equipment,new kitchen hardware installation, etc...anything you need to screw/unscrew.It saves a lot of time and (manual)effort as you don't have to wreck your hand twisting and turning. A very practical buy."
1,did i get a bad one?,"after reading all the reviews for this tool i purchased 1 from amazon..i have used it several times and found it to be far inferior to my milwaukee screwdriver..i barely got about 20 minutes of run time from it..i am an electrician and use it for replacing devices..my milwaukee comes off the truck after sitting a week and can knock off 15 or 20 devices no problem; charge it fresh and it's good for all day..this tool barely made it through 6 devices..i'll try to charge it longer and see if it changes the duration of use..if you are looking for a hard working tool, look at the milwaukee screwdriver kit..you'll pay more, but it is worth it"
1,Not Impressed,"I'm glad it was free. It came with some other tools I ordered. I am a remodeler, and this is not a professional tool. It lacks power, and speed, so I can't do much with it."
3,Film summary/critic/Essential Killinf,"I did not like the ending,it kind of leaves you with a lot of questions about the main character.I did not like the movie as a whole."
3,Essential Killing,"Maybe the best thing about this movie is not having to hear Vinny's whinny voice. Basically it's a silent film. For it's budget I guess it was fine, but what they were saying overall is kind of vague and they should have shown more of the evil water boarding and it's message would have been better understood and been a more powerful film."
2,Synopsis is misleading...way off,"The movie, although well acted by Gallo, far fits the description. First of all, he has no problem killing anyone. So don't go by the synopsis that was written by someone who obviously didn't watch the film. Second, the movie is mostly silent, so there's no dialog that helps you follow the story. However, you soon realize dialog isn't needed because the film never provides a real story line or plot. For example, he flashes back to events from his past but no details or even background are shared. The flashbacks could have been left out of the film and we'd never know the difference. This story is definitely not about war or politics. What this movie is really about is survival in extreme cold conditions. Nothing more. So if you're waiting for an explanation of why he killed, what lead him to kill...you'll never get an answer."
2,Seriously?,This movie is so unrealistic that it's junk. It's got that cheap documentary film setup..and a lame plot. I wouldn't say it's the worst movie possible but it's a pretty poor one.
3,The original is always better...,"I cant say that I was scared more than this one, but it has its moment. It goes to the sister of the first girl. Shows a bit more of the mystery. Little scares here and a surprise at the end. Yeah, I almost came out of my seat again, (the first one scare the be-jesus out of me!)"
2,Bad,"I have to agree with VRegina, this looks like a highschool film project...at best. I wish I could get the 1.5 hours of my life back that I spent watching this farce. It even claimed to be the ""Director's Cut"" but it seems any director worth his paycheck never would have participated. It is a self-indulgent, low-budet hack job."
3,Pretty Good,"the movie wasn't too bad, it seemed to drag along quite a bit, too much useless detail disclosd, but the ending was good."
3,"Decent Movie, 1st one was better","The last 20 minutes of the movie were the best parts....the rest of the film was filler and not really that scary in any means....the first one was more suspensfull but this one had its parts as in the end...i wish that closet door in the baby's room would have opened, that would of made it even better =p.....the ending was kool, some sweet revenge( watch it and you will see how it is revenge)...overall it was a ok movie...needed more suspense as in the first one"
1,It's Paranormal Activity without the novelty or scares,"Skip this tedious sequel. It's all filler, and the ending IS THE SAME AS PARANORMAL ACTIVITY!I only spent a dollar on the rental, and I consider it wasted.The only 'plus' is that there is much less shaky camera work than in the original PA.Bloated, boring, and unnecessary. Just watch the original again."
3,Watch only if you really want to know what happened next...,"When their home is ransacked, the Rey family (Sprague Grayden, Brian Boland, and Molly Ephraim) installs a security system with video cameras in every part of the house just in time to capture the paranormal events centering on their young son, Hunter.I love the shaky-cam, docudrama genre, and I enjoyed the first film, but this one fumbled the ball. It's not a complete disaster; the way its story dovetails with the plot of the first is quite clever. Unfortunately, this one is too much foreplay without enough payoff. It also stretches credibility too much at times in order to put certain events on screen; I don't think a teenage girl would talk into a camera the way this one does, and most families would get a flashlight when the lights go out rather than rely on the light on their video equipment. I also rolled my eyes at the stereotype of the Hispanic maid who just happens to be a fount of knowledge on demons and exorcism."
3,Not as suspenseful as the first one. Still has some suddenly scary moments.,"It's not as suspenseful as the first one because I get used to its filming style. It still has some suddenly scary moments but there are few of them.- The cleverest trick is it involves a baby. Any time the camera turned on the baby and his crib at night, I anxiously asked myself "" My goodness, what's going to happen to him?"". The anticipation of uncertainty was very suspenseful.Overall, it's worth watching once."
3,A Great Sequel,"Although this was not nearly as scary as the first film, this is honestly one of the best sequels I have ever seen. It incorporates aspects from the first film and goes more in depth into the past of the demon that haunts the family. It is a must-watch for any Paranormal Activity fans out there."
5,Simply amazed !!!,"I continuosly am dissappointed at the select people who rate this film , better yet the series, poorly. Coming from a a person who hates horror films for everything they have to offer, I absolutely love PA 1 & 2. Its a complete change-up on how horror movies are made and it is great. The constant suspense the movie has throughout the films amazes and creeps me out all at the same time. Kudos to Oren Peli for making such a low budget film into a great horror film that present day horror films should actualy look up on. The Paranormal Activity Series is going to continue to take the horror series into the next level. With all its thrills, suspense and depictions of what happens when you are really asleep. Many movie watchers are not going to be sleeping for awhile. Coming from now a new horror movie fan, I cant wait for PA 3.My grade: A"
3,Not sure if I like this,"This movie was ok, but I was annoyed by the ending. It was kind of phony is all I can think of at the moment. It was like looking at a Blair Witch documentary. Basically, I don't think I would watch anything else like if for fear I will be wasting a few minutes of precious time I could spend on something more worthwhile. I will have to put this one in the B category."
3,Confusing but good,It's slow going at the beginning and then picks up as it goes along. I loved the first one but I really hate prequels. Guess I wasn't paying enough attention to connect the two movies but each one stands alone. AFter reading reviews here I'm even more confused since there was no child in the first movie which is theoretically the sequel which follows the events in this movie.It's a mess; better just to watch them back to back instead of watching one a while ago and then watching the prequel or watch the second first and the first second.The way they arranged it was a mess.
1,A boring movie that wasnt fun even when drunk,"Im the kind of person that likes just about every movie even if they arent any good. I own well over 700 dvd's and about 100 blu-rays so when friends invited me out to see this movie in theaters I figured why not? I love the horror genre and the trailers made it look plenty creepy.Well I wasted my money. The movie is basicly an hour of nothing happening then small oddities occur followed by about 10 min of weird ""scary"" stuff and then its over. The movie is just a bore and its sad because it had potential. I dont really see how anyone could enjoy it. My description above is accurate. 95% of the movie is NOTHING and the last 5% is suppose to be scary but its just not. Right as things start to get where they should be the movie just ends."
1,Paranormal Activity 2,"This would have to be without a doubt the worst mvoie that I have ever seen. How was this allowed to be put on the shelves for sale. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. Jaws had more jumpy moments."
