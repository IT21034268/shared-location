5,simple workhorse,"i wear this watch every day, it's easy to read at a glance and also looks great. clean design, no bulk, and just large enough numbers. like the other reviewer, i've had to replace the band which is about $40, but it lasts a few years before wear gets to it. i'm very rough on my accessories, banging a wrist here and there into edges can easily markup a nice watch in no time. while i've had to replace the glass face twice (from cracking), the stainless steel bezel is as tough as they come. for the $$, i thought this was the best choice for a casual daily watch, and so far its reliability has proven just that. also love the camo straps - you can find them in olive drab or sea gray. excellent product. my other Victorinox is for dress, and wherever I go, it says ""I've arrived."" You get the picture, can't go wrong with a Swiss timepiece."
3,A tasty snack if you like dates,"I love dates and was pleased to be able to order them from Amazon because they are not always available in my local store.I agree with some of the others that many of the dates are too dried out, I'd say about half of them are like that. You also need to be mindful that you'll run across an occasional pit or partial pit.For the most part they are a tasty snack and much healthier than candy and I'll continue to order them, but I do think the quality control could be a bit better."
2,Poor quality,Dry Dates. I bought this product because it was't available in local walgreens. but would not order it again from amazon
1,Sun Maid Pitted Dates Rate as very poor product received.,"Sun Maid Pitted Dates, 8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 8)I have sent an e-mail giving my opinion of the dates I received.Thank you for your consideration."
5,How to want what you have and have what you want!,"An excellent treatise on living mindfully and in the present and not ""future tripping"" all the time and missing out on the true joy of living - which is a moment by moment experience of being in the present. Great read!"
5,An objective Reading of History,"This is one of the very few objective accounts one can find in the western world about the history of Palestine. The Creation of the so-called ""Ancient Israel"" is really but a Western literary idea. The Arabic historical reality of Palestine is confirmed in this fascinating Book. The conclusion of the book is that the Now-Israel is just a Myth which is enforced on the rest of the world through Western domination. A must read for any student of history and anyone who search for truth."
1,Oh Please,"Look, if you hate the idea of Israel and want to read something to comfort you in your fantasies, go ahead and read this book. If you want to learn something about just how much hate can derange the thinking processes of some academics, this book might be useful as well.But why waste your time spending money on a book? Just go to the PLO website, if that's your kick."
1,A disappointing attempt,"I bought this book hoping for a brillant sketch of the history of the people the world refer today as Palestinians. What I got was gruntings about how pro Israeli academicians and acheologists have pushed the case of Israel at the expense of the Palestinians. I think if any people have a history, they should tell it and not blame the other side for not doing it for them. I was disappointed with this book as I was not an inch better informed about the Palestinians at the end of the book. My money was wasted. If there is still anybody that wants the book, I am willing to sell mine at a huge discount.Kizito"
1,Be serious,Shame on Keith Whitelam. He's a trained scholar who ought to know better than to perpetrate something like this. We readers do not deserve this substitution of crude political propaganda for something of academic value.
2,Just plain embarrassing,"I saw this when Taubes book first came out and I have to say I've lost alot of respect for Dean Ornish, and Dr. Oz. Barbara Howard was bizarre "" ketogenic diets make people retarded...!!!"" The only good was that it did show people who Gary Taubes was. There was no serious discussion of diet and health that I could tell."
3,Not Disappointed in the book,"I have to say a friend recommened this book to me. I have never read anything on Budda before. This book, to me, was very confusing. I would suggest that if anyone wants to buy this book they should be aware of Budda teachings because if not - you will be lost... well I was anyways. There was some good things said in the book I understood, but I sure did not get the FULL benefit of its meaning. Hope this helps someone. Its not that I am disappointed in the book at all - more that Im disappointed in myself b/c I beleive this could help me If I knew more about the teachings.I am not sure how to rate this... It feels unfair to rate it low b/c Im not up to speed with this type of thing -- Im sure its a great book -"
2,way too heavy for most readers,"Unless you have been schooled on the fundamentals of Buddhist teachings (which I have not), this book will be way too complicated to be very useful in your life. It simply does not offer the kinds of practical insights that people need in order to change their attitudes and behaviors. The language is obtuse, evasive, just plain difficult to understand for the average college graduate with no background in psychology or religious theory. What a shame. It seems like Ms. Chodron is well qualified to really help people become more comfortable with uncertainty, if she would only write in a language more of us could understand."
5,If you are feeling at a loss,"My mother was critically ill, my husband unemployed, and I was sick from stress. I am not a very religious person in the conventional sense but this book is not conventional religion. I read it while I sat with my mother in hospice and I ordered it for my father to read after her death. Not much can help at times like these but learning to deal with life how it is rather than asking some higher power to save you resonates much better with me and that is what this book is about. It helps you to be compassionate towards others and yourself. I will reread it as I continue to work through my grief and I know it would be a help to anyone even if they are not going through something as life-changing as I am."
3,"Promising Tidbits, but Not Enough","I am new to Pema Chodron, so I chose this book as an introduction to her other work, hoping that it would let me know which one of her many works I should continue with. While I do like the fact that every other page you have a new teaching introducing a new idea, overall I'm left with wanting more. While the bibliography lists the four original books that this particular title stemmed from, I often find myself wishing I could find which book a particular teaching came from so I would know where to go to read more about that."
4,Sound wisdom from Pema in small doses,This book synthesizes the essence of Pema's teachings with excerpts from other books she has written. It makes a nice gift or introduction to the wisdom of Pema Chodron.
3,"Good advice, Maybe a little deep for me.","The principles in this book while sound, were hard for me to grasp. There were a few instances where the point was illustrated with a story, and I was able to embrace the meaning, but for the most part the logic seemed to run in circles. Probably not a good place to start looking for enlightenment."
4,Good Summary of Buddhist Teachings on Fearlessness and Compassion,"This book is well written and it is one of the best in terms of incorporating fearlessness into compassion.The author stresses that to really exercise compassion, you must feel the pain of persons who are facing adverse situations. It is sometimes easy to voice concern for those who are experiencing pain, but at times this concern is nothing more than being glad it is not you who are being effected. I also liked the idea that you must stand up to problems, and not be consumed by them. I am a Buddhist novice, but I found the concepts easy to understand and to incorporate into my daily activities."
4,great book,great book for coping with anxiety and dealing with worries. I read it weekly with my therapist. Then we discuss the chapters and discuss their meaning. The chapters are nice and short.
3,"Good content, bad reader","Pema Chodron is one of my favorite Buddhist authors. She has a way of articulating subtle ideas that really resonates with me. I bought this book and enjoyed it, although much of the content was familiar from her previous books. I picked up the cassette version of the book to listen to while driving, and I didn't make it halfway through the first side of the first tape. The reader's overly emotive, breathy narration is grating. I thought I'd get used to it and focus more on the text, but it didn't happen. This is the same reader who did the audio version of ""The Places That Scare You,"" which was equally unlistenable. It is a shame that the publisher, who coincidentally is also the reader, can't recognize the great gulf between her work and the author's. Can you say ""ego""?"
3,Audio edition disappointing,"Five stars for the content, two stars for the ""performance"". The reader of this Sounds True audio edition is also the founder of Sounds True. She is senstitive to the material but her delivery is overly soft and gentle and so I had trouble keeping my attention on what she was saying. I've listened to other Pema Chodron tapes in her own voice. Pema is a wonderful speaker, very direct, humourous, warm but not ""soft"". Like the previous reviewer, I recommend buying the book over the audio edition."
4,Great Book!,I believe that the main aspect of this book is that you can read it daily for a few minutes and feel much better. This book is something that is helping me out on a daily basis and I love it. I recommend this to anyone regardless of religious background due to the great tips.
4,one of the best I've heard in a long time,"This is heavier than any Norwegian black metal band, more melancholy than most pale, early '80's, British pop. Inventive instrumentation and samples coupled with interesting beats make this the most complicated and ulimately the most rewarding hip-hop album I've heard in a long time. This guy is the best kept secret on the Anticon roster."
5,HOT DARK STAR,Europe 1972 again...awesome. cd #3 is the BEST with neverending Dark Satr. Great Two Souls in Communion. Not as good as Steppin Out. cd#2 is the weakest. Still a great show.
5,One of the finest live albums,"Rockin the Rhein is a great live album from the Dead's 1972 Europe tour and was performed at Dusseldorf Germany.This complete concert was one of the last of the Pigpen era as he would shortly pass away in 1973 of liver problems.The highlight of this concert was an hour's rendition of their classic Dark Star with brilliant renditions of other dead classics like Truckin,Good Lovin,Turn on your love light,Tenessee Jed and others.Very highly recommended along with others live albums like1)Ladies and Gentleman Fillmore east 19712)fillmore west 19693)Stepping out with the Grateful dead England 724)Closing of Winterland5)live at the Cow palace 19766)Hundred year hall7)The Grateful dead movie soundtrack8)Jerry Garcia band Live at Kean college9)Garcia plays Dylan."
3,"From a die hard Dead-Head.. ""OK at best""","Jerry's off, the vocals are off, Donna Jean wails rather than sings and the audiance never even gets into it. Thank God for PigPen, his songs make the album worth listening to.If you have all the other live recordings then go ahead and add this one to your collection; otherwise pass on this one and go after some other live albums first.Check out ""Steppin Out with the Grateful Dead"" - not this recording is sublime!"
3,"Great, but i little inconvenient","this cd is great, but it has three cds in it and all the best songs r spread out between them (or at least my favs), but if i want to listen to all of my favorites, i've gotta cart around all 3 of the cds...:( i don't have a ipod. Other wise, it's great, but i just wish Truckin and Casey Jones were all on the same cd. but this is great if u do have an ipod or other mp3 device"
4,"Finally, Ms. Harris's side of the story is told!!","This is a good DVD to watch, especially if you are interested in the history of Death Row records. The ugly shady dealings within the industry are also exposed."
2,Watch the first one!,"Most sequels are disappointing, and this one is no exception. Meet the parents was a very funny movie with clever jokes, mostly coming from bumbling Gaylord and Pam's domineering slightly psychotic father. Meet the Fockers is nothing but a bundle of cheap gags. Ex: Barbra Streisand giving Pams dad sex therapy. Yes its wrong and not pretty to watch. Pams dad strapping a fake mammary gland to his chest to nurse a baby. Baby spouts profanities. You probably get the picture. To tell you the truth ben Stiller looks bored in this movie probably because the only jokes he makes are falling down and gluing babys hands to a rum bottle. The ending is horrible with beautiful lines such as Pam saying, ""Daddy how can you have a circle of trust with nobody in it?"" sobs quietly. Ok so dont waste your time by watching this sad excuse for a comedy."
2,Meh.,"Very dissapointing. Meet the Parents was funny and entertaining, but this heavy handed sequel was so forced it hurt. This kind of comedy can wear on you after awhile. Every single thing that can go wrong for Ben Stiller's character does indeed go horribly awry- and then they make up more stuff just to screw him over again. Its not even funny after awhile as they repeat the same gags from the first movie and reach for ""plot twists"" that neither surprise nor impress."
4,"funny at some parts, not appropriate","This movie is definitely rated PG-13 for a reason. Most of the humor is ""dirty"". It's not exactly as funny as the first one and definitely isn't as good as ""Meet The Parents"".This movie is about a man(Ben Stiller)that is marrying another lady. The only problem is that they have completely different families. Ben Stiller's family is loud, obnoxious, and very open about private things. You can bet that's where some of the dirty humor comes from. The girl's family is very polite. They are very private about private issues...and the two families put together create a funny, not hilarious, movie. Most younger kids would not get this, and not to mention this movie is NOT appropriate for them. Alot of things happen in this movie, which I'll leave you to see. This is more of a comedy for adults."
3,Kind of overrated,"Seems to me that the extent to which ""Meet the Fockers"" is seeing such great box office success and popular acclaim is because of the all-star cast. An all-star cast can get you in the door, but the performances have to earn their pay. Since I saw this as a $5 discount matinee, I think they did. Granted, the movie is funny, and for my money, better than its predecessor, ""Meet the Parents"", but merely funny does not a blockbuster make. I'm not a Ben Stiller fan so maybe that's why I was underimpressed, and he doesn't do much for me here, either. DeNiro easily carries this flick for me, as he did in ""Parents""."
3,Meet the Sequel,"Typically with sequels, they tend to add more and more and make it more about the characters than the plot, although this movie was funny, it didn't really provided anything new and only further cements that some films don't need sequels."
2,"Not Even Close to ""Meet the Parents""","Let me just say, I LOVE ""Meet the Parents."" It's one of my favorite movies of all time.Let me now say, this movie is NOTHING like meet the parents. The whole movie is based on two things:1. Cheesy Sex Humor2. Gross out gagsNothing else from this film is memorable (except for the always amazing Robert De Niro reprising one of his best roles.) Gotta love Jack!Skip this movie, see the first one."
5,We liked it!,I don't care what anyone else said this was a laugh out loud kind of movie. Especially since I'm the daughter of a cop (and we tend to have strange senses of humor). After talking with my staff at work too we all liked this one better than the first.
2,Predictable slapstick,"Sequels are not usually that great. This one is no exception. The main gist of the movie is that, following ""Meet the Parents"", Pam and her parents go to Gaylord's house to meet his parents. While Pam's parents may have been more traditional and strict, Gaylord's are liberal, loose, and fun-loving people, and those differences cause obvious clashes during the movie. Also not surprisingly, Pam's father still has some doubts about his future son-in-law being man enough to take care of his little princess.There is some comic element to this movie, and I guess I would have to admit that there is a little thought in the plot, when the couple gets a little surprise in the middle of the story. And if you're into slapstick comedy with the usual cliched situations, you may just find this entertaining. For myself, it was hardly worth watching once, but never again. The comedies I like are the ones that are actually funny."
5,DVD purchase,"I was very happy with this seller, my dvd came on time and was a great price.Thank you I will be ordering from you again!"
4,Hilarous,"This movie is classic comedy movie in which has no rival in the previous few years. HOwever, you get many of the same old jokes you got from ""Meet the Parents"". Although most of them have been used before they are still funny and this movie is still worth owning."
2,Booooo!,"Ok, so it wasn't absolutely awful, but pretty darned close. I loved ""Meet the Parents"", but I should have known better with a sequel. It did have some redeeming moments, but overall, the parts that were supposed to be funny just felt so forced. It definetly wasn't worth my $4 bucks at the video store (at least I didn't drop $9 bucks at the movies...phee-u!). Only rent it if you're desperate and can't find anything else... Better yet, go home and go to sleep."
1,"Sure, If You're Bored","""Meet the Fockers"" is about Pam and Gaylord meeting the other side of the family tree. It's basically just like ""Meet the Parents,"" except an annoying baby is added into the story line. If parents let their children in elementary school watch it, they have a lot of explaining to do.Unless you have nothing better to do, do not waste your time watching this movie (or the money to rent it)."
1,Fock You!,"This movie was AWESOME! Ben Stiller is a comic GENIUS, he's the new Jerry Lewis! DeNiro, AWESOME! Hoffman, AWESOME! Streisand, AWESOME and still very sexy for an old liberal ho! I thought the sight gags were priceless, and the plot line serene! This was Hollywood movie watching heaven! This film should have won some Academy Awards! I mean if Marisa Torme can win for My Cousin Vinnie, these A-1 actors should've at least been nominated! This is a highly entertaining film, and I recommend it to every and anyone to see, but wear your Depends, because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard! Dubya 99, you don't know what in the FRIGGIN' H E L L you're talking about! Yeah like we're suppose to take the opinion of an anti-social loser, that complains about going out to the movies? Stay home, I'm sure Dateline NBC will be calling soon about that episode they had recently."
3,Not as good,"This didn't compare to ""Meet the Parents."" Meet the Fockers had a wonderful cast, but it just didn't fall through. The laughs were scarce and the humor pretty bad. The plot is the same as ""Meet the Parents"" Greg(Ben Stiller) must meet the family of his new wife. He basically must ask permmision from these wacko parents. The father and law also has something strange about him. This movie had potential but it turned out to be a dissapointment, a typical sequel."
5,Funny,This movies was too funny! I could barely quite laughing! If you didn't think it was funny then there is probably something wrong with you! Ben Stiller is a great actor and he really shines in this comedy!
5,"Funny movie, must see movie",Very funny movie. Deniro was very funny. Hoffman was also excellent in this role as the father. I definitely recommend this one.
2,"Convoluted, unfunny mess","Well, the first movie was a gem. Very funny, situations flowed well, most of it worked, and worked together as a cohesive whole. Pretty much the opposite of this poorly put together sequel, which wastes a lot of good talent.The jokes are stupid, over the top, and require the characters to do a lot of actions that seem to be done just so the situations can be set up. The humor is dull and slapstick, and isn't funny. The ""risque"" jokes intended to be funny just by virtue of making the audience uncomfortable fall flat. They didn't make me uncomfortable, and they weren't funny. I did feel somewhat sorry for the actors forced to deliver the lines, but I figure they saw the script before they agreed and decided to do it just for the money.Save your money and spend it on the original, or on Zoolander instead of this."
1,Since the movie is so impossibly boring...,"and cliché, and predictable and tongue-in-cheek, and trited, and mindless, I'm going to summarize this movie as:Utter Waste of Money and Time.There's nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing positive to say about this movie. They were pushing it with the first one, however, it was passable and watchable. This sequel is one that should have never put out. It's so enclosed in its idiocy that it obfuscates the acting value of thespians of great caliber. Avoid!"
4,"Better film than the 1st GOOD, not perfect film","I Like this film better than the 1st.Why. Adding Dustin Hoffman & Barbra Streisand.I am not a fan of Barbra's but she & Dustin were great in their roles to me. Added with DeNiro 3 Oscar winners.The 3 of them with Blythe Danner are perfect in their roles.Teri Polo has a role that is just a watcher of course.Now, I am NOT a fan of Ben Stiller. He does his usual routine in this role as he did in the 1st & in ""There's Something About Mary"". Same lying, put out then blows his top role. Wish they could have gotten a better actor for the role.And, we MOST DEFINITELY could have done WITHOUT Owen Wilson in both films.As for the DVD, it is a good package. I like extras & this one has the kind I like. Deleted scenes, bloopers, etc.A BIG MINUS FOR THE DVD, IT HAS THE HORRIBLE LITTLE FLIP OPEN FLAPS ON IT.Otherwise, you should enjoy the film."
1,Deniro's lowest point in his career!,"I am saddened to see someone go from Mean Streets, Taxi driver, Raging Bull, Deer Hunter... do this junk. I guess the scripts aren't out there so he has to lower himself to do these formula comedies that might be funny to a seventh grader. The title says it all ""Fockers"" I could hear Bevis and Butthead laughing at this word because it sounds dirty. The movie isn't any better with its sophomoric humor. Once you've see a Ben Stiller movie you don't really have to see any of his other films because they are basically the same format and are as predictable as his other films. It seems like if you are an actor or singer on your way out you stop and do a Stiller film before you go. Sad!"
3,Two Hours of Fun?,"I think -yes.I am not a big fan of sequels, toilet humor, little dogs humping everything that moves, overdone baby jokes, ""Fockered"" jokes, and Ben Stiller. Barbra Streisand is not on my list of the favorite actors, either. But I saw ""Meet the Fockers"", I laughed out loud, I liked it a lot and I may see it again on DVD. Dustin Hoffman was hilarious - wild and crazy; together with Streisand they made a great team. Streisand was very funny as a Jewish Mama (I am dying to say Mother Focker - but it's been said hundreds times already. Well, I did say that :)) - Sex Therapist for octogenarians. They were the best things about the movie, and it was enough for me to spend very nice two hours (my husband and my son enjoyed it, too. Actually, it's been quite some time since I saw my husband laughing so hard at the movies).3.5/5 or 7/10"
2,An Inferior Sequel to Meet the Parents,"Given the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Ben Stiller's parents, along with Robert DeNiro back as the hot-tempered Jack Byrnes, you'd think that ""Meet the Fockers"" would be a tremendously funny movie.Alas, I was very disappointed. The gags and dialogue don't work nearly as well as in the first film. What kind of screenwriter would think that attaching a fake breast to Robert DeNiro, or having a toddler utter profanities, or giving Greg Focker an illegitimate son, would be funny to watch?The running joke about Greg's last name ran pretty thin in the first film, and in this one, they run it into the ground.It's a shame so many talented actors had to work with such a lame script."
1,"So bad....so very, very bad.",One of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life (and one time my ex made me watch a movie about Mare Winningham getting a brain transplant). I had to watch this with my girlfriend who laughed the entire time. I don't understand why she was laughing. I think she was drunk. Her lika da suds! If I could only get back that wasted time in my life I promise I would do something worthwhile with it. I would help an old lady cross the street or pick up cigarette butts along the beach. Hopefully by posting this review I will have saved somebody else some time. Somewhere out there an old lady needs help crossing the street.....go help her instead of watching this movie. That is all.
2,"La Barb, Rain Man, DeNiro and Moses have the most fun....","....I could use an entire film with father and mother Focker--Hoffman and Barb--because they definitely seem to enjoy their work here and it shows. La Barb is a bit zaftig here but that's okay, she still comes off as The Owl and the Pussycat kinda sexy.Hoffman's throwaway lines ('Can you believe I concieved him with one testicle?) are terrific. And the dog which 'humps everything that moves' who is flushed down the RV's terlit...funny, funny. Alas though. Stiller and Polo didn't seem to want to join the party as they kinda telegraphed in their acting. Oh, well...see it for the synergy of Striesand, DeNiro and Hoffman. You'll enjoy them."
4,Light. Comedic. Funny. Star-Studded.,"""Meet the Fockers"" picks up where ""Meet the Parents"" left off. The shaky truce between ex-CIA mastermind Jack (DeNiro) and would-be son-in-law, male nurse, Greg (Stiller) will be tested. Further, the emotionally distant Burns are about to meet touchy-feely aging boomers Bernie and Roz (Hoffman and Streisand). In the middle of it all, peacemaker and arbiter Dina, Mrs. Burns, finally has enough and puts her foot down.There are many chuckles in this movie; DeNiro, Streisand, and Hoffman play their roles with gleeful relish. The bonus features confirm what the audience suspects - the stars really had fun shooting this movie. The playfulness among them just shines.Inside the circle of talent, the four parents play like kids in a sandbox as Stiller watches from outside. All-in-all, this movie is fun and enjoyable. There is little to take seriously and mercifully, they don't."
2,Tediously adolescent,"The story line was quickly lost in an overabundance of sexual innuendo and tacky bathroom humor. As is often the case, sequels are better left to the imagination."
4,It was a riot,"By far it is not the best movie ever created. I thought Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand were fantastic in their roles. My wife and I as well as the whole audience just bellowed with laughter. There aren't too many movies out today that you can just enjoy. There was no subliminal thoughts passed on to you, no anguish, no sex, no violence, no subplot.... just flat out dumb humor. Every once in a while you need that type of experience.Bravo to the Fockers. Can't wait to get the DVD and to see the Focker's Have a Baby."
2,Reviewers with Arrested Development,It's surely a reflection on the deficiencies of society and of parenting that most of the reviewers were among those racing to the theater to help this movie set records. You HAVE to be kidding! Better than the first? Such anal infantile humor and you bozos eat it up! You are so untraveled and so unwordly. Try to get OUT for often and experience life.
1,Stiller ruins it !,"I think this movie finally proves that Ben Stiller is more obnoxious than his mother. Stick with the funny fart movies, Ben, they're more your speed. Some comedy traits you are just born with, and evidently you got all of your mothers genes and none of your fathers. As for the big time stars in this movie.I don't know what the fock they were thinking."
3,The Fockers were great!,The Fockers were great! And by the Fockers I mean Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman. Not Ben Stiller though. He remains unfunny as usual. I try to avoid Stiller's movies but I was forced to see this one because of the amazing chemistry Streisand and Hoffman share. They really should do another movie together where they are the stars. 'Meet The Fockers' was an alright movie. The poopy and pee pee jokes might be funny to 10 year olds but I prefer intelligent comedy. I give the movie 3 stars for the excellent casting.
4,Meet The Fockers,"Typically, your shipment date is not a timely as you suggest. I like your ability to have in stock diffrent movies. Keep up the good work, but improve your shipment dates. The movie had a high level of excellence. I feel, I will continue to order movies from Amazon!D E. Fowler."
2,Less Funnier Than The First And Over-rated,"Meet The Fockers is a seuqel that was disappointing to me. As I progressed through the first 20 minutes of the movie, I figured it will probably get funnier. To my suprise, it actually did. But then the movie progressed into a bland tasteless comedy after the second half of the movie. The movie tries to reach its goal of being hysterical but sinks into a bland comedy. Although, I did like the idea Of Hoffman and Stressiand being in this film. They were enjoyable to watch. Although Robert DeNiro is less funny in this film and quite boring. I couldn't stand watching him in this film. He just got on my nerves. He was funny in the first one, but now he is just the opposite for me in this sequel."
1,Repulsive,"Hyped because of star power, lacking anything related to class or humor, a poor way to spend your time, it trumpets contempt for you if you have values because you have them."
1,Just not funny.,"How could this be a comedy? It seemed more like a documentary of a couples' parents meeting. It seemed like everyone was against Gay(Ben Stiller)in the way they talked down to him, embarrased him, and showed no respect. Why would this happen?The parents became so annoying throughout the movie and were acting like children. I actually turned it off half-way through as the jokes were not funny at all and the attitudes of the parents were extremely unbelievable."
4,Streisand and Hoffman steal the show!,"I had also watched the first one, ""meet the parents"", but I think I liked this one even better. Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman are great, they are terribly funny but also give a real ""human"" dimension to their characters. I had a lot of fun watching the movie. Of course, it's more a light comedy than a ""cinematographic masterpiece"", but it's truly funny, very well acted and touching in some of its messages."
2,Uninspired retread,"It's a shame to see talented legends reduced to low-rent comedy that tries to be hilariously vulgar but fails miserably. The only redemption in this sorry sequel is the amazing screen magnetism of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. Who knew Dustin Hoffman could actually be likable in a movie? Who knew Streisand actually has a sense of humor about herself? Ben Stiller is funny but a little too old for the sad sacks he always plays. The Burns family trio (DeNiro, Danner, Polo) is so plastic and one-note I could hit the mute button and not miss a beat... DeNiro really needs to find something challenging before he starts competing with Robin Williams for film roles. If not for the pedigree of the cast, this would be a decent movie, but I really expected better."
4,Don't Believe the Negativity...It's Hilarious,"I'm so tired of everyone looking for Shakespearian perfection in every film, bottom line, it's a dumb comedy, so turn your pompous search for meaningful dialogue and great script-writingoff and enjoy the laughs. It's a comedy, not Macbeth. I kept hearing how horrible it was, well guess what, surprise, surprisethe critics were wrong again! If you enjoyed the first film, you'll love the second, it was every bit as funny, if not funnier. I don't laugh easy either, but it had me rolling most of the film, in tears laughing at times. I know when to be critical and when to put the brain on pause and just enjoy a good old fashioned laugh. It has that Farelly Brothers-type gross out humor, if you enjoy that sort of thing which I do, then you'll enjoy this. If not, go rent 'Annie Hall,' and spend needless hours pining over the film's lighting and set direction, you know, 'the important things in film'...rolls eyes."
4,VERY FUNNY AND WELL WORTH WATCHING,"just when greg thinks things can't get any more embarrassing, his future in-laws take the trip to meet his oddball parents! what insues is an almost non-stop laugh-fest!DVD includes deleted scenes, bloopers, commentary, the focker's family portrait, behind the scenes with jinx, and more.just a word to the wise-do not waste your time watching the extended version, at every extended scene the DVD stops then starts again really messing with the flow of the movie. just watch the theatrical version then go to the special features and watch the extended scenes."
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worst sequels in recent memory. The movie is painfully unfunny and the humor is tired and forced. Robert DeNiro looks embarrassed and what's happened to poor Blythe Danner? So talented but so wasted.The only shot of energy in this film comes from Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand. It's great to see them on screen together, particularly Streisand who has not been in a film for several years. She has star quality to spare but she deserves better than this garbage."
1,Not Very Good,"This film is so DUMBED down....and all the characters except perhaps the character played by Dustin Hoffman are drab and unlikeable. I'm sorry, but this is not worth the price of the rental :("
1,Zero stars,"PLEASE, please LISTEN to the people WHO HATED THIS MOVIE AND RIGHTLY! It is like eating a lemon with a thin candy coating--pleasant for a moment, and then you hit the bad parts. This movie is upheld by a cheap framework of sick jokes, and jokes with more than one meaning, and gross baby jokes. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RATED R, this cheap fodder. There's ways to make comedy without resorting to sicko s*x jokes. (...)"
1,Gimme A Break,"What is wrong with society that a movie can be produced with a title that resembles such a lame twist on the ""F"" word? Have we stooped that low? Is our pool of imagination/creative/artistic productions that banal? It is the fall of Rome, except it's the United States and we're living in the times where sex is supposed to be funny and bad words are too. It's sad. I feel sorry for our kids, of which I have two."
2,The Law Of Diminishing Sequels works once again...,"What I can't understand is the total lack of energy that Stiller put in his performance. It's so bad, so by the books, so uninspired, that it did not seem the same Gaylord Focker we watched in MEET THE PARENTS. This alone was responsible for a great part of the disappointment that this sequel is.Hoffmann gets out of this mess untouched. This guy is a master actor, he can play anything, he has timing for anything. De Niro is, to my pleasant surprise, better than in the first movie.The trouble is: the script is not even close to the hilarious quality of the first movie."
5,We Fockerized them,"This has to be the best sequel to a movie I have seen in a long time. You go into movies thinking that they will not match up to the first one, but this movie just blows me away. It has to be one of the funniest movies of the year. And that is saying a lot with Napoleon Dynamite, Dodge Ball, and Anchorman being released this year. The movie is just none stop laughs. I have to say that it is better then Meet the Parents. So if you found Meet the Parents funny then you will love Meet the Fockers. I can't wait in till some of my other friends go to see it so I can watch it again.And for those of you who or money conscious it is worth the few extra dollars to watch it after matinee passes. If you don't have the time during the day."
2,Leave a good thing alone,"I was in high hopes for this movie because I really enjoyed the first one. And maybe my expectations for it dampened the joys of the movie. I just didn't find it funny or humorous at all. I thought it was over the top, the whole Babs being a sex therapist for the older folks...it just seemed like it was pushed, trying to be funny and not it being natural. I will say PASS...believe me when I say that you're not missing ANYTHING!!!"
2,The Bloopers are Funnier than the Movie,"Dustin Hoffman comes off as a flake who is perhaps mildly retarded and Babs is a lecherous (...). Yeeach! DeNiro's character is a complete psychopath. I think his Taxi-driver persona was more sane than Jack Burns. They try to recycle the same old shtick for the sequel, but it falls flat because Ben Stiller comes off as the most normal person in the bunch. Even more so than his wife-to-be who deserts him at every turn. But that football scene - man that was funny though ... not. The Manson family needs to pay a visit to both these families."
3,Good Fun,"I LOVED Meet the Parents and with the addition of Hoffman and Streisand was excited to see this. I wasn't bowled over, but I wasn't dissapointed either.Fockers has some great comic moments and it is a hoot watching the old pros play against type in this one. Hoffman and Streisand are a welcome addition to the family, but DeNiro again steals the film.Definitely worth a watch. Or two."
5,i really laughed till i wept..................,"I COULD REALLY RELATE TO THE FAMILIES INVOLVED AS WELL; THE PERFORMANCES BY THE WHOLE CAST ARE WONDERFUL, OVER THE TOP, ZANY, ETC. THEY GIVE IT ALL THEY'VE GOT, TRULY. IT'S A FANTASTIC LOAD OF FUN, MY FRIENDS, AND FROM BEGINNING TO HILARIOUS END. AS USUAL, UNIVERSAL BRINGS ALL THE GREAT SOUND, THE GREAT AND COLORFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY REALLY TO LIFE! IT LITERALLY SPARKLES ON DVD! I COULD NOT SEE IT IN THE MOVIES, AS I AM HANDICAPPED, BUT MY DVD ARRIVED ONE DAY EARLY TO MY PLEASANT SURPRISE, AND I WATCHED IT BACK TO BACK. HOFFMAN, AND STREISAND REALLY GRAB THE BULL BY THE HORNS HERE AS WELL. GO ON, GET IT, HAVE A GREAT TIME LAUGHING, YOU'LL NOT BE LET DOWN-I SURE WASN'T."
2,Blah,"Completely unoriginal. I think I've seen Ben Stiller do this movie 50 times and it has yet to impress. Another safe Hollywood cash cow full of drab humor, and knack for annoying."
3,People might be expecting too much,"Based on many of the reviews I have read, I think people were expecting much more from this possibly because Hoffman and Streisand were in it. With a title like this, you should go in expecting an easy to watch film with a few laughs. And it does just that. I must admit, I went in expecting the worse based on the reviews, but it surpassed my expectations. Meet the Fockers is very easy to sit through, doesn't make you look at your watch, and it has some great laughs (even if they are rather crude). Everyone enjoys a film from time to time which doesn't require too much thought.Hoffman, Streisand and De Niro steal the show for sure. Stiller isn't too bad as the son embarrassed by his parent's behaviour. My advice: Do not to take it seriously, just enjoy it. It is a good value 3 star film ... no more, no less."
1,Painfully Bad,"A thin soup of potty humor, fart jokes, and juvenile cheap laughs. You know something is terribly wrong when you are halfway through a comedy and you haven't even cracked a smile.Good gawd, Dustin Hoffman sitting on the toilet?Robert DeNiro breastfeading a baby?Foreskin dropped into a fondue pot?Wow, a movie that hurt to watch.It wasn't even worth renting for free from the public library."
4,"Goofy, but fun. Hoffman with DeNiro are terrific.","For a sequel, I think it was pretty cute. Hoffman and DeNiro have great chemistry. The addition of the Grandson (and his sign language) gave me many chuckles. I rate it three and a half stars. It's better than good, but not quite great.It's a friendly, and lighthearted flick. Worth the purchase."
2,If you like the first one...you will hate this one.,"Meet the Parents was clever and understated with deadpan Ben Stiller get wound tighter and tighter around the axel with at first the seamingly normal parents of his fiancee.This one is too obvious, too vulgar, too slapstick to be clever. You can guess all of the jokes before you put the dvd in. The thing that got me the most was how over the top stupid the Fockers were. It would have been much more funny if the 2 families would have liked each other superficially at first and then as they learn more...grow further apart.What a waste of time for some very good actors."
1,Meet the sleep - zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,This movie was so bad I fell alsleep on the couch.Ben Stiller's worst movie tied with Envy.Don't buy/rent this sucky movie.
2,"a few yucks, but mostly just Yuck.","This movie has a few ok laughs--Ben Stiller can almost always at least get a chuckle out of me. Unfortunately the rest of the cast lets you down. Dustin Hoffman is corny and unbelievable, Robert Deniro has more ham than a deli, and Streisand--oh god, Streisand. Barbra Streisand (or B.S. as I like to call her) makes me want to retch every time I see or hear her. Whether it's acting (if you want to call it that), singing, blogging, speechmaking, or kicking puppies like the soulless conniving parasite she is, she makes me want to jump off the nearest bridge to put myself out of my misery.Skip this movie and pick up a copy of South Park Season 1 which features the classic episode ""Mecha-Streisand""."
4,Meet the Fockers,"Gaylord Focker's parents are everything that Pam Burns parents are not. I really identified more with Pam's parents, the Fockers were a bit too loopy for me, but still they were great fun as portrayed by Hoffman and Streisand. I absolutely loved Robert DeNiro's portrayal as Pam's over the top Dad. Great movie."
3,Of course Ben Stiller makes the movie.,"anything with that of ben stiller you know will be somewhat creative and funny as all get out. however, i did not find 'meet the fockers' nearly half as funny as 'meet the parents' to be honest i don't really think they should have made this ""sequel"" at all. yeah, it was funny. but i think the first movie pretty much left off at a perfect place. yeah, in part I we didn't meet greg's parents, but still, i just don't think this sequel did justice compared to the first one.PROS:funny, all you would expect from ben stillerCONS:kind of running in circles, their wasn't much need for a sequelOVERALL:rent it don't buy it"
3,Similar To The Original,"Same format same results. Yes, its amusing but the story line is so identical to Meet The parents. Robert Denero's character is so mistrusting of his future son in law. Hoffman and Striesand are a couple of goofballs. A little funny but alot silly and full of nonsense. Ben Stiller seems like the most sensible one in this film.Don't buy all the hype. This movie is OK but certainly not over the top."
1,What the Fock!,"For all the hype and publicity this movie got, it really sucked. Stars galore in this, but you know what this proves, without quality writing the movie will still blow. I don't understand how Hollywood can put together so much money to make a movie, but not be able to connect to the audience. I'm sick of watching crap."
3,EVEN WITH Tens of million$ and a star-studded cast ...,"OK, let's say you have no ethics and therefore, decide to be a Hollywood writer. Or in this case, let's say you have no talent either, and decide to work with a team of writers and produce a frankenstein of group-think. You are given...Tens of millions of bucks, and are duly informed, that you will have scenes including the following actors:Robert De NiroBen StillerDustin HoffmanBarbra StreisandIn other words, every comedy writer's wet dream.How can you miss?This movie missed and we can only fault the bonzo writer(s).It was just funny enough for me to keep my finger off the STOP button, but the laugh-meter just stayed in the middle range. With the heavy firepower from the likes of Dustin Hoffman in particular, I expected MUCH, MUCH more."
2,Yawn,"Dustin Hoffman comes off as a flake who is perhaps mildly retarded and Babs is a lecherous whore. Yeeach! DeNiro's character is a complete psychopath. I think his Taxi-driver persona was more sane than Jack Burns. They try to recycle the same old shtick for the sequel, but it falls flat because Ben Stiller comes off as the most normal person in the bunch. Even more so than his wife-to-be who deserts him at every turn. But that football scene - man that was funny though ... not. The Manson family needs to pay a visit to both these families."
2,Typical sequel,"There was lot of hype for this movie, as well as several recommendations that I heard. Apparently hype sometimes actually informs the opinion of the moviewatcher. Ignore the hype--this movie isn't nearly as good as the first. Probably part of the reason for the hype is the addition of Hoffman and Streisand (maybe to make up for the weak script). If your sole definition of humor is sex and bathrooms, you'll like this movie (but don't eat while you watch it--you'll lose your appetite in some places). If your idea of humor is genuinely clever and funny scenes as in ""Meet the Parents"", save your money and time. One more thing--you can't trust referrals!"
2,I paid 19.99 for my first DVD.I've been FOCKED,"Its almost worth getting Focked seeing Streisand,Hoffman,and De Niro in the same movie,and THERE ALL GREAT,but this movie is not a film you want to see again.There are a couple of laughs,but this DVD is not worth buying,just rent it,or borrow it from a friend,or you will get FOCKED,Like I did."
1,Horrible Movie,"I thoroughly enjoyed Meet the Parents, and I was a bit skeptical of this sequel from the beginning. I knew that it couldn't possibly be as funny as the original, as is generally the case with sequels. I would still have at least liked it if it hadn't been for all the sex jokes.If you're looking for an adult film that has a sex joke about every few minutes, then buy this DVD. If you're looking for a family comedy that you could watch with your kids, look elsewhere."
2,Lacks Imagination,"This film seems to take all of the gags of ""Meet the Parents"" and take them just a little bit further, far enough to fall flat on their collective face. Then characters are too extreme, Greg's parents too wild, care-free, and down-right annoying, and DeNiro too uptight and high-strung. All in all there was very little in the film that was actually funny. Sometimes sequels are just unneccesary, and this was one of those instances."
3,Meet the Fockers!!,"Overall this movie is a 2 1/2 star movie. this movie had somelaughs but other than that it was F*cked up. This is no familymovie at all cause it involves with sex. I would not buy this movie, rent It. This is one of Stillers worst movies.ZOOLANDER was his worst movie.g2g and rent this movie if you are B.O.R.E.DOh and don't buy this movie cause the Extras sucked."
5,Bach virtuoso,"I was lucky enough to hear her play in concert a long time ago, but I have never forgotten it. These recordings cannot equal the impact of a live performance,of course, but they are a pleasure. She is the musician who made Bach come alive for me."
3,Al-Qaeda,"One of the first books published after 9/11 Corbin paints a vivid picture of an organization and it's varied modes of terror.I read this book several years ago, and enjoyed it very much.However, it is a snapshot of an evolving organization, and the conflict to defeat it. By it's nature, it's perspective has expired by the time the ink has dried."
3,Annoying Flaws Ruin a Good Knife,"I've got a couple other Gerbers and I am generally pleased with them as a midrange knife. This one however has some flaws. Maybe I just got a bad one, but this knife is the hardest knife to open I own. It's easier to press up on the blade that it is to press up on the thumb tab (and yes, I did lube it). On top of that, it's hard to close because the lock is one side of the frame, so you're actually pushing one side of the frame to the side to lock it.There are a couple of pros (which is why this still gets 3 stars):- The blade does seem to be well made, and hold an edge- The serrations and standard part of the blade are about the right size- Being all metal it feels very sturdy- Even though it's hard to close, using the frame as the lockup does produce a very tight lockup"
2,"Good knife, bad belt clip","The clip on this knife is very poorly designed. The piece of metal that the end of the clip rests on is itself a hook. This hook catches everything, making it impossible to slide the clip easily over any kind of fabric, like your pocket. I have to use two hands.Otherwise I like the knife."
1,Crap. Absolute Crap. That goes for all Gerber Products,The knife pitted in 3 days. 3 days. The knife had rust spots and the second on e they gave me did too. I returned it and bought a real knife. The steel couldn't keep an edge anyway. This is more disposable then a razor blade.
4,Very attractive and functional knife,"I really like Gerber blades, they are affordable and extremely durable. This pocket knife is thin and fits very nicely in my back pocket. The knife slides open easily and is comfortable in my hand. The unique design allows it to be clipped onto a backpack or vest very easily."
2,Not comfortable with this knife,"I picked up this knife from Wal-Mart. I thought the Paraframe 2 design was cool, and wanted to give it a shot.Pros:-Solid lock up. No blade movement up/down or side to side.-Ability to open and close with one hand (it's a right hander close, sorry lefties).-Sharp out of the package. Ready to use.Con:-After playing with it, the paraframe design gave me the feeling that one of my finger tips may get sliced. More so if I used my left hand. Right hand, not too bad.-The frame lock on this knife is very uncomfortable to use. I did play with it for nearly two hours, and my thumb hurts.-The handle retention is very weak. A little shake and the blade falls out of handle.-The pocket clip is really hard to use.-Doesn't feel comfortable in my hand when the blade is in open position.I ended up returning this back to the store. This knife is not for me.Moral of this experiece is to find a store that will let me try the knife before I buy."
5,Martin Simpson Teaches Alternate Tunings,"This is a good instructional DVD. Martin Simpson teaches various guitar alternate guitar tunings. He goes slowly and explains very well what he is doing. He focuses on the user understanding how the different tunings function and how once you know one tuning you can often adapt it to another tuning. It is strictly instructional, so if you want to hear him play full-length songs, I would suggest you get one of his concert videos. I recommend it to people who want to start using open tunings, which have enormous potential to improving your playing."
3,Entertaining but forgettable,"I would like to give this 3 and a half stars, whereas I would give the sequel, Between Two Fires, four and a half. The book kept my attention but was ultimately unsatisfying. There is more drama than action. Too much on Jones' social and political life in Paris, tedious intrigues with Franklin and French aristocrats and officials to get some ships to go to war. Jones is a flawed hero, and a bit of a bore. He is presented through the eyes of John Severance, his first officer, who tells the story of his time with Jones to two aristocratic whores to earn a night in bed with the both of them. The device is unnecessary, and the women are featureless."
1,The Eighteenth Captain,This book could have been entertaining reading if the writer had only stuck to the story line. It was diverting the way the book hopscotched here there and everywhere.
1,"C'mon, Ed, you can do better...","Longacre needs to stop churning out so MANY books, and start writing better ones. This book is way overpriced, is small with large print, and due to the general and shallowly-researched content, is simply not worth the purchase. This work sharply contrasts with his much better recent works on the Federal and Confederate cavalry.There is much more of the story to tell about the cavalry during the final days of the war, and Longacre did not do it with this one. Don't waste your money or time."
5,Something for everyone...including M:TG Artist wannabe's,"I got this book not too long ago and I've gotta say, this is one for the records. It centers all around the great and wonderful art of Magic: The Gathering: The Rath Cycle. I got this book because the Rath Cycle is my #1 favorite add-on for Magic, and I love the art. It tells you behind the scenes stuff about all the different characters and places in the Rath Cycle. Now, don't get this book thinking that you're gonna get every picture in the set. They have alot of the art, but not all of it. I thought that, but I was still amazed when I got it. I use the book to help me sketch out the stuff I couldn't on the cards, they were too small. But they blow them up for the book. It's a great book, a must-have for everyone who appreciates the art and magic of Magic: The Gathering."
3,not as advertised,"The product detail states this is a 5 yard bandage, when in reality it is only 5 feet - but will stretch to 5 yards (not what I wanted when I ordered it - I wanted a bandage that was 5 yards to begin with, the response from the company is that it will stretch)."
3,Didn't last very long.,"I needed this to wrap my knee, and it quickly formed wrinkles that cut into my leg. Maybe I didn't wrap it properly, By the third use, little threads were popping out of it and the bandage was losing elasticity. I think it should be sturdier."
2,Flexible Wrap,The fabric is OK but the clips are very light duty. I probably wouldn't buy this product again. Look of a better product.
3,Same as others,"Nancy Martin is one of my favorites, but this book disapointed me by using either the same or similiar patterns. For someone who doesn't have one of Martins book you will love her designs and instructions."
1,This crap is a joke...don't waste your money!,"I don't know what I was thinking to waste my money on a product that doesn't list ingredients. After a couple of tries with this sugar based gel I threw it in the garbage! Thank god there are products out there that do work. If you want a product that lists ingredients and is guaranteed, tryVieNue Vivify Vaginal Rejuvenation & Tightening Cream / Gel for Relief of Vaginal Relaxation. Now this is the real deal!"
3,"Have no idea if it really works, but gave me some peace of mind","I actually hung this over the handle of my infant daughters car seat when we traveled on an airplane. She didn't get sick on the numerous trans-america flights we took which is a good thing. I did attempt to reach the manufacturer of this product twice, leaving detailed messages both times to make sure it was safe to use this product around an infant but they never got back to me which I found extremely rude and annoying, thus only 3 stars. I went ahead and hung it up anyway though my husband teased me mercilessly and told me I'd probably spent $30 on a blue light. (it makes no noise, but a blue light turns on) I didn't care, planes are nasty."
1,Ozone alert!!!,"I bought this for additional protection during flu season. It sounded like a good product and most of the reviews were positive but after only three (3!!!) days (average about 3-4 hours use each day)the blue light stopped working. More importantly, I developed a headache and a wheezy feeling in my chest and throat after the FIRST day! After the light stopped working I decided to do a little research on ion air purifiers and I am pretty certain this little gadget was the cause of my discomfort. I don't have asthma, but this article from the Mayo Clinic (and other online articles about air ""purifiers"") helped inform my decision to return this puppy and look for another solution to combat the flu and other unwanted airborne germs. [...]Long story short, if you enjoy sucking ozone into your lungs and the respiratory distress that causes, then this may be the product you were looking for. Otherwise, I recommend DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!"
3,Worked fine but handle with care,"I purchased this for a travel, and was pleased with it. The sound is whisper quiet and it gives off a pleasent stream of air. It has that ozone smell, which I like, but can aggrivate asthma in some. The charger is very cool too--compact and fast. Unfortunatly, it fell out of my bag on a trip and hit the floor, and stopped working completely. So it is my fault for dropping it, but it must be a fairly delicate product so be careful with it!"
1,GAVE ME A HEADACHE! EMITS OZONE ~ DON'T BUY,"WHEN I USED THIS PRODUCT, IT GAVE ME A MIGRAINE HEADACHE. OTHER REVIEWERS ALSO MENTIONED GETTING A HEADACHE WHEN THEY USED THIS. I READ THAT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO OZONE, TURN IT ON FOR 15 MINS BEFORE USING. ALLERGIC TO OZONE? I RESEARCHED IT AND FOUND OUT OZONE can harm lung function and irritate the respiratory system. THAT MEANS PEOPLE WHICH ALLERGIES SHOULD NOT USE THIS. FUNNY, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN AIR PURIFIER THAT HELPS ALLERGY SUFFERERS. ANYWAYS, I TURNED THIS THING ON FOR OVER 15 MINS BEFORE USING AND IT STILL GAVE ME A HEADACHE AFTER 5 MINS. I WISH I CAN RETURN THIS AND I WISH I HAD LISTEN TO OTHER BAD REVIEWERS. I BOUGHT 2 OF THESE TOO!"
4,Got this for H1N1 Protection,Well this either works or the folks that saw it on me just stayed away because they thought I was from a different planet and receiving messages on the unit. I'll update when the flu season is over.
1,Check with airlines,"Near the end of an Alaska Airlines flight, the Flight Attendant told me they weren't allowed."
5,"Again, a winner","Yes, I am a HUGE fan - she puts the best characters in historic settings with great stories!!!"
4,good read,"I enjoyed this book as I enjoy all of this author's books. The time period was one I haven't come across too often in romance books, so that was a pleasant change in setting. As always, good characterization and full plot. I recommend this one."
3,"Interesting plot....upsetting, predictable ending....","I enjoyed this little indie film. I thought it was well acted, and had an interesting plot. The first half of the movie is definitely better than the second half. The ending was predictable and disappointing. But overall, give this movie a try."
1,bad on so many levels,"The acting is bad, the storyline even worse and worst of all it works with stereotypes and prejudices, like Arabs are suicide bombers even if they seem to be nice. I don't think you learn anything about Israel and its culture, except if you count a few shots of Jerusalem. The movie is the equivalent of a dime novel and plain bad with no redeeming qualities whatsoever."
4,on the journey,good review of midwifery as it started in america. has the essentials needed for classroom knowledge where to begin and end your research.
5,Great customer service!,"I was very happy with the customer service, they know what it takes to keep customers. I would buy from again and refer to a friend."
2,Ruined by an ending,"This movie was a reasonably entertaining comedy up until the last 5 minutes, nothing special but certainly not bad, then came the ending which made no sense and seemed tacked on. I would recommend skipping this one."
3,"very nice transfers of classic sci-fi, done in widescreen the way it should be viewed, nice color.",Good quality of some sci-fi classics- hope to see more classic releases.How about someone getting us a good copy of Roger Cormans classicNOT OF THIS EARTH. This classic flic should be on D.V.D.
4,World Without End/Satellite in the Sky,"I'd been looking for a copy of ""World Without End"" for a long time. As kids, my sister and I were allowed to stay up late on Saturday nights to watch a local weekly TV show usually showing Horror or Sci-Fi movies. This film was one of our favorites and we'd probably seen it on late night TV at least 2 or 3 times. The special effects are pretty ""hokey"" now - but back then, it was exciting to watch. It's got drama, action, monsters from other worlds, heroic guys, beautiful girls, lots of bad guys (or creatures), and of course a happy ending. Needless to say, I'm very glad to finally find a copy of this in DVD. Nostalgic, and fun to watch, even after all these years - Fifties Science Fiction at it's best. What a treasure!"
3,Old Sci-Fi movie found after years of searching,"I've been searching for this old sci-fi movie for a long time.It's by no means a block buster film, and is not all that well known among the more famious old filmes, But anyone that enjoys the realy old sci-fi movies that are still enjoyible to watch should be glad they got this hard to find movie.World Beyond End is the much much better of the two movies on this DVD and is the one I myself had been searching for. The seciond film, Satellite in the Sky isn't realy very good but Hey! It's still a seciond sci-fi old movie for the price of one."
4,good movies,Amazon is very good at filling the order andsending it out. I liked that I could track myorder. The movies were very clear when I watchedthem and I am very satisfied. Thank you very much.
4,Old Sci-Fi movie,I had seen this movie years ago and it was good to see it again and in color. The quality was good.
5,Works perfect,"After reading about others' experiences with failed digital scales, I decided to wait a bit before producting a review. I have now had this scale for several months. It works perfectly and appears to be very accurate, as verified with two other scales. Note: When you first turn it on, wait just a few seconds after the zero appears on the screen before stepping on it. If you step on it too soon, it will give a wildly innacurate reading, because it has not finished setting the tare weight. I believe this has led to some people believing their product was defective when it really wasn't."
4,We miss you CBGB,"This is a combo set one DVD and one CD. The DVD sound and video are incredible and fun to watch. The CD is the same as the DVD. The CD good but its live crowd is yelling in the mic, I would rather have the studio version for the CD. The DVD is sick."
4,Average Job,"I must be a rubber-necker to the highest degree because I always enjoy these type of books. It has the standard fair, nothing really new on the format. The author does give us a good amount of detail, which she is known for. I would always like more photos, but there is enough to tell the story. If you like this type of book then you will enjoy this one."
4,A blessing for damaged hair,"I have very dry, frizzy hair and it looks even worse after I wash it--that is, until I tried this shampoo. Sap Moss shampoo is very rich and moisturizing and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth. It tames all the flyaway bits and makes styling a breeze. I like to combine this shampoo with Brilliant conditioner (also by Aveda), another great product. All in all, I recommend this shampoo to anybody who has damaged, problem hair. It certainly helped me! I also like the smell, which is earthy and herbal."
5,"expensive, but WORTH IT!","I love these socks! Yes, they are expensive, but they are SO WORTH IT! The thick cushion provides an extra layer of cushioning, useful for both pronators and supinators, and also helps keep the socks from shifting on your feet, reducing blisters. They are strong enough to reduce that dreaded ""big toenail hole"", but soft and comfy.I do hang them to dry, rather than use the dryer, but I have 8 or 9 pairs that are over 6 years old, so they wind up costing less in the long run than do cheaper socks."
1,Wha are these guys talking about? This is terrible.,"Bad acting, worse dialoge, horrendous direction - where do I begin? This is a movie that asks ""Am I Gay?"" and pretty much does nothing else. It feels like it was written and shot by 14 year olds, both emotionally and professionally. I guess if I was gay and trying to decide who I was....nah, this would still be amateur hour."
3,The Art ofBeing Straight,"Could have been better, but arrived timely and in good condition! Could have and should have been more fun, like an old fashioned sit com."
5,"""Feeling and Knowing the Joy and Passion of Your Aliveness""",Do not underestimate the power of this very simple yet extraordinarily profound ceremony! You can't help but feel your own wondrousness and aliveness! This CD is the most moving I have heard when it comes to knowing and feeling the truth of your own being: reclaiming our own power.
4,A good edition with a few flaws,"The other reviewers have made good observations about the text, so it might be helpful to shoppers to also know something about the book itself. This edition has the appearance of a facsimile (though none of the s's that look like f's, which is nice) with ample margins for notes. The only thing crowding the margins are Bentham's own summaries of each paragraph's contents, which are extremely helpful and short enough that they don't really rob you of substantial note-taking space. One disappointment was that, unlike the Dover edition, this book has neither a detailed table of contents nor an index. Also the book is fairly cheaply bound; the cover flap on my copy has started to curl after only a few weeks of use, and the glue in back doesn't look like it will last forever, or 10 years for that matter. But I suppose you're only paying $10, and for those who are interested in this influential and controversial philosopher, this book isn't a bad way to go."
3,Skinny as ethiopians,"I purchased this at Zia's and have seen them at Skrappys quite a bit. This CD is good, however, the quality brings it down a little. The first track is probubly my favorite, but sadly I could not find ""Penis Flower"" on this album, which they have played live before and is quite humorous. The hardcore kids are too cool to like them, but if you like original/punk/screamo bands this is for you."
1,Terrible,"I like overdue thats a good song but the rest of the cd is terrible they sound like a bunch of old 70's rock songs. I dont understand, some people are saying its good that they change there sound, i have no problem with that but u dont go from a emo-punk band to a 70's weird rock band in one album thats how u lose ur fans u have to gradually change ur sound thats how they might have one some fans over on this cd."
5,Kids to Men?,"Missing are some of my favorite aspects of Get Up Kids' prior offerings; the rough edges, tactile sounds, and synth-punk wailings of their early work. In their place, however, one finds the clean, confident, and mature sound of a band that has truly hit its stride.Toning down the Keyboard-driven mood in favor of a bass-and-guitar-heavy mix, one is first struck by the change in emotional charge. This album never reaches the same highs and lows as ""Something...,"" but it does not suffer for it.The Kids are growing up. And it's great to hear."
2,The worst Get Up Kids album ever,"Uninspired, boring and repetitive.... It's by far their worst album ever. I agree with the person who said they're not emo... they're really not. If you want emo, go for Bright Eyes, but if you want some fun rock music, skip this album and pick up ""4 Minute Mile"" and ""Something to Write Home About"" instead. ;)"
3,It should be the New Amsterdams,On A Wire sounds nothing like the previous albums. For the most part the cd sounds like it is New Amsterdams. I was very dissapointed when it first came out. Not one worth buying enless you like the New Amsterdams a whole lot.
4,A solid album !!,"I think most everyone who's heard this album talks about how it's too different, or it's too much of a departure for The Get Up Kids. I'll say one thing: I don't think it's as good as their previous work ""Something to Write Home About"" but it is good, nevertheless.The first single off this cd was an acoustic number, if that shows how different this album is, compared to ""Action an Action"" off of the last one. The Get Up Kids have traded in the bubble-gum, synth, pop sound of the last album in for a more organ driven, classic rock sound. The result is an album that delivers the same catchy songs, but just not as rockin.' Ones to check out are:""Overdue"" ""Let the reigns go loose"" ""All that I know""and ""Walking on a wire.""This cd stayed in my car for a week, and when I took it out, I quickly had to pop it back in. While it isn't as rockin' as their last album, they're still some catchy tunes."
2,i think lots of you have got the wrong idea...,"look, it's not about whether or not it's emo, or whether or not their sound changed for this album, or anything like that. it's just that the songs aren't that good. overdue, fall from grace, and hannah hold on are great songs -- but aside from that it's just not that great, musically speaking. people aren't mad because it doesn't rock out, (at least for the most part), so get it straight for all those of you who gave this all the possible stars and ripped on people for complaining -- the majority of the album just plain isn't very good. i'd rather have downloaded those three songs than bought the album. and can we stop all this talk of ""growing up""??? their next album could be another rockin' out masterpiece. bands have been known to experiment. it happens. unless you are a diehard fan, i wouldn't recommend it, and even then i'd still just download those three songs."
2,This is going the way of the New Amsterdams,Hey Get Up Kids! We already have the side projest doing some great stuff. But dont forget what made you great. I think it's safe to say that most fans would agree with what i'm about to say. We need some songs that have some energy and say F yeah man. Stuff we can jump around the room in are boxer shorts to and sing along with. Bruce Springsteen is slowing down but hes in his 50's dont do it yet man.
3,hippie ...,I am a freak for the get up kids and i was highly dissappointed by this album. I... They have totally lost the punk edge that they had on the first three albums. I would only recomend this album to true fans of the get up kids. If you are just starting out with them get something to write home about. Dont even think about this one!
3,In a word: Boring,"The Get Up Kids are my favorite band. I love them partly because they write such deep and thoughtful music, but also because they rock. In this CD they seem to have forgoten the rocking part. On a Wire is not just lacking, but pretty much absent of any of the driving, kick-[rear], energetic music found on Four Minute Mile, Something to Write Home About, and the Red Letter Day EP. The songs are still good, but compared to the standards set by their old CDs, the Get Up Kids come up quite a bit short this time."
1,this is terrible.,"This album is nothing like 5 minute mile or Something to Write Home About. If you liked previous albums for the awesome guitar riffs and distortion and emotional singing you will probably think this is a waste of money. The whole album is emotionless ... with soft, extremally finished guitars with the whole thing sounding a lot more like they might be giants then tguk of old. The songs are melodic and kind of have this happy bouncy boring way about them. I don't like to criticize one of my favorite bands, but this is terrible. I'm probably not going to see their tour just because this album is so boring."
2,Ouch - the junior year slump,"Wow - the New Amsterdams are really working hard, what with two new releases in one year. What's that? This is the new Get Up Kids disk? Oh..."
1,"Utter, Utter, Utter Rubbish!","My beloved Get up Kids. One of my all time favourite band with the great albums ""Eudora"" and ""Something to write home about"", tarnished by this complete drivel!! I mean there are no redeeming factors in ANY of these songs. I feel angered that I've not only been cheated out of my [money], that I had shipped from the U.S to myself in the UK, but also that the genre of music has changed. There is no more banging beats mixed with beautifully placed emotional guitars and keyboards. All I can say is I'm really disappointed, and I can only hope that TGUK will go back to there original sound, as they will not pull there original crowd back in with this plain boring Indie music. If you are a GUK follower i highly recommend, and I mean highly, that you stay as far away as possible from this album. In my closing lines, I'd like to say I still have hope in TGUK creating another creative/emotional/moving/lifting album in the future!!!"
2,the kids lost their emotion,"what a flat boring album. the songs go nowhere. the music puts me to sleep. what happened to the emotion that used to drive the get up kids. are they trying to get radio play with this album, cause if they are they'll only be played on adult contemporary rock stations. there's no hooks and no catchy songs on this album. the only good song is 'grunge pig'... the artwork on the album is the only good thing about CD."
4,Some people don't know what good music is,"First off, did the Get Up Kids ever say they were a punk band? That is what a lot of the reviewers here seem to think, as all they expected was more raw sound. I personally believe this the Get Up Kids greatest album. The music is incredible, and the lyrics to teach song are simply remarkable. Matt Pryor has always been known for his incredible use of lyrics, and it shows on this album. An excellent display of what good music is, not punk! Oh yeah, I highly recommend buying this album, even if you are a hardcore punk fan."
2,2.5 stars,"I am a huge fans of everything get up kids up to this album, but this is thoroughly mediocre. Not just because their sound has strayed far, far away from emo, but because it's just not very good. The first song, ""Overdue,"" is admittedly killer, and the second, ""stay gone,"" is pretty good too. After that, it is a whole mess of entirely forgettable songs. I've listened to the album more than half a dozen times, waiting for it to grow on me, wanting it to impress me, but it's just not happening. i don't fault them, good for the get up kids for trying something new, but i hope the next experiment is better."
3,"get over yourselves emo kids, they're changing","I admit, this CD is not as good as it could be. However, that has nothing to do with the fact that it doesn't have a strictly ""emo"" sound to it; the songwriting simply has slipped a little bit. For those of you endlessly droaning on about how the new GUK album is horrible because it doesn't sound like their other albums, that's the point. ""Four Minute Mile"" doesn't sound exactly the same as ""Something to Write Home About"", and it's obvious that they are trying something new yet again. It's always good to try something new, in my opinion, and while this is probably not their strongest album, I'm glad to see that they refuse to be pigeonholed into being simply an emo band."
1,Simply Boring,"With the only redeeming song on this album being ""Overdue"" Id have to say that this album is not only a big let down, its also incredibly boring and uneventful. They've mellowed out not only with this album but in their live shows as well. I remember TGUK as spunky and fun live, now they just kind of stand around. Too bad, they use to be great."
1,I don't understand...,"I'll admit that I've never been a fan of The Get-Up Kids, but leaving out any biases, expectations, thoughts of the band, or past albums I really do not like this cd. I don't understand how I could be a fan of so many emo bands or partially emo bands and not enjoys this at all. I really like Taking Back Sunday, Dashboard Confessional, Finch, Alkaline Trio, and Rites of Spring, but I can't get into The GetUp Kids' new album ""On A Wire"". Maybe there's something I'm missing. I'll try listenning again, hoping that something will change, but at this point I say go listen to the bands I listed above, they're not quite as boring."
2,Is this really TGUK?,"When I listened to this CD for the first time, the first two songs, ""Overdue"" and ""Stay Gone"" resembled the Get Up Kids alright. It sounded like all their other stuff. But once I got past those tracks, I heard so much I didn't like. This CD doesn't sound a single thing like the rest of their stuff. It's actually... terrible. I'm going to their show this July and I am praying to Bejezus that they don't play too much of this stuff. Everything was great up until this album (but that's just my opinion)."
1,This album is terrible,I dont know what to say this cd is simply slow and boring i cant just sit down and listen to it. thats it i dont know what happened i dont care what happened the new get up kids suck!!
1,This album blows chunks!!!!,"What did they turn Country-alternative? Man, some of these songs sound like old 70's stuff your mom and papa used to listen to. Over all this is very disappointing for a band that had so much potential. Dont buy this album, or for that matter save your ears some pain and don't download it for free online."
2,¡Me gustan las papas fritas!,"Let me start by saying that bands often grow and begin to take on a new sound, and you have to respect that. Nevertheless, I have been anticpating this album for over a year, and was majorly let down. ""Something To Write Home About"" was a special album to me. EVERY song was amazing -- you could listen to the entire album all the way through and never get tired of it. The new record just isn't special to me. But again, you have to respect their choice to redifne their sound, it just isn't as intersting to me. The album has its moments, but to be honest, its hard to listen to it all the way through. If I were you, I'd buy Hey Mercedes ""Everynight Fireworks"" --they are a great, under appreciated band.Don't you hate pants??"
4,"Different, but good","As for the new album, On a Wire, the pop vibe the band took with the last original album is stretching further. But once again, they have done it in a way that doesn't make them seem like sell-outs or pushovers, but in a way that makes them look like the talented band that they are. The songs on the album come from a more eclectic selection of influences, mixing their usual distortion-heavy punk tributes with some lighter, more Beatles influenced melodies and keyboards (All that I know). Also, the background vocals are something worth mentioning in this album, with catchy ""oohs"" and ""ahs"" (campfire Kansas). Overall, this new album shows a growing level of maturity for tguk, showing that emo bands really can grow up."
2,Disappointing,Really disappointing. Mid-tempo and kind of dull. More like watered-down New Amsterdams than GUK. I had to force myself to keep listening. Try to listen to someone else's copy before shelling out for this.
3,The Replacements??,"This album was not what I was expecting from The Get Up Kids. At first I was very dissapointed. Not one single fast song! It doesn't have The GUK's signature energy. Instead they went with a sound very familiar to one of Matt Pryor's greatest influences - Paul Westerberg of The Replacements. It definitely has that feel (slow, ballad type). After giving the album three listens, it's decent, but not The Get Up Kids I knew and loved."
4,After I Really Listened,"I got an advance copy of this about a week ago. I love the Get Up Kids, so I was really stoked. So I play it.... Well, I had luke warm feelings. It was slower than their other albums, but I kept listening, and around the third spin, something clicked. I don't know what did it for me, but I dig this album. The songs, while slow, are great. Well written and, fine I'll say it, catchy.If you are a true GUK fan and you hate this album, spin it again. It grows on you."
2,Great for beginners but for anyone else its a lousy set,The Magic Starter set helps kids a lot with learning how to play. The CD is especially helpful because it teaches kids how to play through a number of mini-games. The game is also playable right out of the box for two players. The reason I only gave it two stars in fun was because of one major problem with it. The problem is that the Starter cards are not allowed to be used in the real game! So basically if you have learned how to play already and decide to move on to the real game you can't use the cards from the Starter at all. This makes the starter just a huge waste of money.
5,A must-have for all Juan Gabriel fans!,"Juan Gabriel in Bellas Artes is wonderful! This gifted legend has given so much to the world of music and this 2 CD set proves just that. ""Te recordare dulcemente"" is a precious ballad and his ""Amor Eterno"" makes you feel the violins as if they were your own heartstrings!! This is a wonderful set to own or give as a gift to any Juan Gabriel fan."
5,He has always been one of my favorite singers that ever live,"I really don't know if he even sit down to read all of this but if he reads my I will be very happy to know. Well I just hope that when he comes to Laredo, Texas and gives a concert it will not be that expensive because I would like to take my mom to see him "" Juan Gabriel ""! I know that is rare that he comes to small city like Laredo but in those small city is where he is list by most of the people. Hope to see Mr. Juan Gabriel soon in this his small city."
1,Toshiba Adapter Power Cord,I bought this item in March 2011. It barely lasted one year....Don't buy this product - it is not reliable.
1,Cheap product,Purchased two of these items.(two computers) I am completely disappointed !!!!! Split only after two weeks of using them. Don't waste your money!!!!!!!! They should send me out replacements or refund my money.
1,Don't Buy,Worked for about 5 weeks. Of course the company I bought it from wouldn't accept a return. Bought from BestEZonlinestore. Would not recommend.
3,Sort of Disapointed,"I guess this is an ok game if you just like to fly around over boxy, grainy settings. The graphics are not good but this is an old game so what can you expect??? I bought it because it was so cheap. There is no limit to where you can go in the world on this game though, fly anywhere!! I recomend a newer version, it is worth the money to buy Flight Simulator 2000 instead of this 98 version."
3,Flight Simulator 98. Just ok,"I got this game years and years ago. I do think that the handling is real but it needs about 4 more aircraft.Another complaint is the graphics, it totally stinks and is like a 96 sim. Also the cockpit is unreal too. I also don't like the radio thing, it's too complicated."
3,It's OK....,"Flight Simulator 98 provides lots of scenery and many airports for taking off. It also gives you cool air vehicles that you can ride. It is fun to fly a plane, but in this game I can't seem to either find a runway or even land my plane without crashing. If you wanted to actually land in another airport, you would have to sit in front of the computer for hours or lots of minutes piloting the plane, which after a little while gets a bit boring. If you are a big flyer and you have the patience to sit in the cockpit and control a plane for a really long time, you should get this game."
3,not made well,I had to put the cart together. It was easy to put together but many of the parts were not made correctly. Some did not have drill whole and some did not fit the wholes correctly. I had to ask for parts twice. All in all the cart is not made well and is still shakey and the drawer does not fit well. I will never order from this company again and feel I paid too much for this product.
3,The Cars Unlocked - The Live Preformances,"Not all that... Not much narrative or personal band history along the way. I like the Cars and the music was great, it just leaves you wanting more story line or maybe they don't have much to tell. So if your srtictly looking for music video and little talk, this is the DVD for you."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"I should have known what I was in for when the dvd begins with a disclaimer stating the footage was shot ""20 years ago"" when technology was not as good as it is today. Give me a break, Monterey Pop looks and sounds way better than this and it was filmed over 40 years ago! I cannot believe they even released this footage it's that bad. As far as the live cd that comes with this set, I've heard bootlegs that sounded better. What about the show from 84 that was released on vhs? It was much better quality, the least they could do is release that on dvd. Stick with your Cars cd's or the 84 vhs if you want to see them live and skip this."
5,Cars Unlocked dvd/cd,"If you like The Cars...Get this set. I see some negative responses about the sound and picture quality and dont know why??? This isnt a live concert filmed in HD and it was never supposed to be. It has great old footage with some interview stuff/behind the scenes mixed in. Yes, they should release all their videos and the live 1984 show on dvd but this and the Musikladen is all we have now. Maybe with their new cd being released next Tuesday 5/10/11 we will see some of those old videos finally put onto dvd. The Cars Rule!!!!!"
2,Only for Cars lovers only,I do like their music but I agree with much that has been written. I will listen to it again but not much better than listening to a cd.
3,Not first rate but enjoyable,"Over many years in cover bands I have performed many of the Car's hits. I have most of their songs on CD, but never got a chance to see them live. I saw this DVD the other day and thought this is my only chance to finally see the boys live. I was disappointed in the video qualitity. I understand it's old tape, but I wish it was up to other DVD's I own of live bands. The sound is also lacking,but I have to tell you even though it's not top qualitity I really enjoyed watching this and couldn't stop untill I saw it all. They were very well balanced in the mix, in my opinion so you can pretty much hear everything everybody played and the vocals are nicely out front. I have a new appreciation for the band and especially the vocals of Benjamin Orr. He really shines on this, what a talent he was. If you really like the Cars you probably will enjoy having this one too. Not perfect, but it's not because of their performances and I'm glad I bought it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is just a one big letdown for Cars fans. I had hoped that this would be better that the Cras first DVD , but not in this case. If you are a huge Cars fan like me you will be sorely dissappointed !! If the VHS concert of the 1985 tour (hard to find) see's the light of day on DVD , that will be the ultimate Cars DVD , for that was a great VHS concert."
2,Nothing else to buy ? Take it......,"I have used a few digital cameras but have not found any unusuall qualities in the Pretec DC-520.The picture quality is just average,not better than its competitors.I bought it 2 months ago but have used it just for 5 or 6 times.Instead I like using my JVC Digital camera.It has many more functions than the Pretec DC-520.I would not recommend you to buy this."
3,Good value,This is the second digital camera that I have owned and is by far nicer than the last one that cost me 299.00. A very good value.
5,My son asked for his own copy--that's a recommendation.,This book seems exceptionally complete. It is the first school text my son has ever wanted to own. His group uses the Spanish translation to prepare for the Biology Olympics.
2,Doesn't play,"I've tried two copies (Amazon quickly sent a replacement to my original purchase) on three different dvd players (each new players including one blu-ray player). Neither play except in my computer's dvd player. Product info on Amazon and on the package itself indicate ""Plays in all regions."""
5,La potencia que dio Fobia.,"Sin duda el disco que fue el menos popular de Fobia, pero en el que en realidad muestran su capacidad y su potencia. La voz de Leonardo era la mejor del rock en español, que junto a la potencia de uno de los mejores compositores de Mexico y uno de los mejores guitarristas de Latinoamerica me refiero al lider y motor de la banda Paco Huidobro hicieron un extraordinario trabajo, sin olvidar a Cha!, Iñaki y Jay. Este disco muestra a Fobia en su mejor momento, y tocando como nunca, modernizando canciones viejas, y dandoles el toque de su propio estilo. A ese punto llegaban mas maduros que nunca pero desgraciadamente esa madurez mato el grupo, cada quien se fue por su lado, Leonardo se convirtio en popero y los demas haciendo sus proyectos individualmente, pero esperemos que Fobia regrese algun dia, porque dejaron un gran vacio en sus fans, incluyendome a mi."
2,my son did not like it.,my son was not even interested in the latern that he got for christmas it was not the exciting for him and that he does not pay with it. how can i return it if i want to.
3,Good Product,My toddler was hard on it and the handle lifts right off... nothing a little super-glue won't fix. It provides an extremely bright light and he loves the design!
1,NOT HAPPY WITH THIS CD,I was very disapointed with this CD. These are not the original cuts and the music is distorted. My other CD's play just fine. I have the originals on LP and these cuts sound nothing like the LP.I'm still looking for the ORIGINALS on CD.
3,Not just about fasting,"If you are a beginner like myself, this book may not give you everything you're looking for... There is a lot of information about fasting and fairly detailed guidelines on how to do a fast, but there is also a large amount of info about spiritual healing and other subjects that kind of turned me off. The information was a bit confusing for me to sort through (not well organized). I was looking for more of a text book and this is more like a chicken-soup-for-the-faster kind of book. I found a little bit more science in Paavo Airola's books as well as some helpful info in a pamphlet on cleansing that I got from one of the Wild Oats chain supermarkets. For some general information and one of many daily guides to a short fast this is an ok book, but if you're looking for more hard facts or need more instruction, I would check this out at the library, and use it as a supplement to other more focused books."
4,X-men Card Game is da bomb,"At first,being a Magic the Gathering player, I was skeptical about how the game would work and feel. I was afraid it was going to be a rip-off with X-men characters. I was completely wrong. It is so different from Magic, yet it still captures the feeling of a great card game. The dice feature is a welcome addition to card games that I have played. it is also simple to learn, but the more advanced you are makes it more fun. The cards are beautifull and well desinged. I think it is a great game with lots of inovation."
5,"Impressive ballads, catchy dance rhythms and a voice to look out for!","Better than the previous CDs these are 10 songs which mill make your toes tingle! Ballads for all those special moments in your life and watch out for number 2 and 10 which will make you sway your hips and dance till you drop! And where did that voice come from????? Powerful, warm and heartbreaking.....completely stunning! Can't get enough of it!"
1,Avoid - Not as pictured,"The actual pin looks sort of like the picture, but more like something you'd find in a dollar store. The ""coral"" roses are glued in different positions, looks like it was put together cheaply. Also comes in cheap box. Inside the box the pin is in a bag with ""Made in Korea"" in big letters. Although I wasn't expecting fine jewelery, I'd be embarrassed to give this as a gift."
4,Lovely coral and jade pin,"My coral and jade pin looks beautiful and has good quality workmanship. The only shortcoming I could see is that the clasp could have been better constructed. It's a little stiff. I like my pin because of the graceful design, pretty pink coral carved flowers and dainty size. At about 2 inches long, this is not an overpowering pin. I thought that it was a good value for a costume jewelry item."
3,Actually 3.5 stars,"I can't help but like Lemona--Giant Drag sounds like My Bloody Valentine forcibly merged with Smashing Pumpkins, fronted by Kim Deal. It's totally lightweight and derivative but it quickly burrowed into the part of my brain stem that loves early 90's alt.rock. Plus this EP features one of the most disturbing song titles ever: ""You ***k Like My Dad"". Think about that. Nasty.The thing keeping me from going 4 stars or higher is a nagging suspicion that Giant Drag is not really an indie band. I wonder if this disc and the subsequent album are really stealth major label releases. I can't put my finger on anything specific--something just doesn't feel right..."
4,Belonged on Creation in the heyday of shoegaze,"A little uneven as it sounds like this ep was recorded over different sessions, but wow... when they get their late 80's early 90's shoegaze on, it sounds excellent!"
3,eh,"Many other reviewers have criticized Crawford's complaining attitude. I actually didn't think he complained as much as some have made him out to. Yes, he complains about overbearing officers etc. but overall he doesn't go too much into politics of the Iraq War.The stories he does tell though, are really not that interesting. But what they lack in action and excitement, they make up for in offering a glimpse into the life of a modern US soldier. Crawford is not sympathetic to the plight of Iraqis and intimates that none of the US soldiers were. In fact his description of the army's attitude is very one dimensional and broad. This may be an accurate portrayal or he may just not be telling us all sides. I find it hard to believe that all soldiers dehumanize the Iraqis as much as Crawford and his buddies seem to.I have not read other memiors from the Iraq War but I think if one reads this book, maybe some other memiors would be good to compare with."
2,Forget accidental soldier,"I was highly disappointed with this book. Not only was it poorly written, so much of it seemed more like the random imaginings of a drug addict. His stereotypes of various people; his sexist behavior; his total lack of concern for the soldiers in his battalion - all signs of his lack of being a true soldier. Then we find out at the very end that it's not a true story. The only true story in the book is the very last one."
1,Would you like some cheese with that WHINE?,"Although Crawford does give some accurate accounts of experiences in Iraq, he by no means speaks for a large percentage of soldiers who served there including myself.We all have our personal opinions about the war and why and if we should be there. Many joined the military for college money. However, to whine about it achieves nothing. And the entire theme of this book is Crawford constanly whinning and blaming everyone else for his misfortunes. John, you were in a war... ""War is Hell"". You didnt spend anymore time over there than anyone else. I spent a year in Afghanistan, to only return to Iraq four months later. People should be aware of the horrors of war, but the story should be told with some dignity. You or your book has none. There was always blessing to count....even in hard times. You should have remembered your brothers in Bastogne!"
3,"good, but short and disorganized","A very raw account of parts of the author's experiences in Iraq. Definitely gives us a view of the war that is not shown in the popular media. The writing is good, but occasionally over-the-top. Each chapter is a vignette, and the chapters do not have an overall narrative flow. The chapters jump around in time and are sometimes repetitive. Also, the book is relatively short at just over 200 pages, large print, and small pages. Read it in a day, both because it was interesting and because it was short. A good, compelling read, but short and disorganized. Check out military blogs for similar material."
2,"Read this book instead..""Detained Differences""","Those of you that walked away with a sour view from this book, read ""Detained Differences"" by J. Robert Rowe. You wont be disapointed."
2,Hard to tell where the truth ends and the BS begins,Its hard to tell what is true in this book and what is not true. If you can buy another book - then do it.
3,Too Good To Be True,"Several of the reviewers here have commented on how this book ""might be something straight out of Hollywood"" and I have to agree. I got the strong suspicion while reading this that it was more fiction than non-fiction. I enjoyed it, in spite of its overwhelmingly negative tone towards the Iraq war (there's literally nothing good at all said about the U.S. intervention or occupation), but keep your B.S. detector on for sure while reading it. Every single cliche you've ever seen in a ""gritty"" Hollywood 'B' war movie is present here, the guy might as well have saved the world single handed from nuclear holocaust while he was at it, or captured Saddam himself"
1,The worst True Story I Ever Read,"This just seemed like a bunch of random stories. There was no coherent story line, lots of complaining, and lots of profanity. It is a world of difference from the experiences described by world war II veterans and a drastic difference in maturity and values."
4,Devastating,"With a callousness and stoicism that seems ready to crack at any moment John Crawford's writng vomits horror into the social indifference that sent him to war in the first place. With casual brutality and moments of compassion,Crawford illustrates the degradation of being a combat soldier. Whatever your politics are, they dont matter. This is a must read for all accomplices in the invasion of Iraq."
5,Pass It Forward,"Now I can relate to my Son...silently. Now I know the truth inside of him. Now it's inside of me. As a Mom, I held strong while my Son was over in Iraq for over 15 months, but yet cried through this whole book. It held my heart so tight I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was there his every step, his every breath.Please keep the truth going. Please Read this book and then pass it forward.John Crawford, No words, no ceremony, no ribboned medal could adequately honor you or all the other service men and women in the service for our Country. Your sacrifice is remembered, respected, and deeply appreciated. Sign me, Just a Soldier's Mom"
4,Honest but a bit sloppy,"Good, honest memoir held my interest. Was a bit put off by some 'extra-curriculars' that colored the conduct of our troops but this is a good story I was compelled to keep flipping the pages on."
2,Chronic Complainer,"This is John Crawford's account of being a soldier, the horror's of modern warfare, and his unsucessful attempt at assimulation back into society. Some what of a depressing book. Crawford comes across as a chronic complainer who complains way too much."
1,Poor and Unrealistic Example of The U.S Military,"I can have NO respect for a presumed author that leads the reader to believe that he is writing an autobiograhy of his own experiences, and then lets the reader down with his weak ""POOR ME"" attidude. Nor can I admire ANYONE (no matter what the Nation) that can take pleasure in watching a small, weak child running from bullies,------and is so delighted with the prospects of seeing a bloody beating that he invites a buddy to observe with him. A whiner and a coward! I have read books by Female soldiers that were far better ""men"" than he was----and better examples of what we grow in this U.S.A.---- Not worth the time of anyone that lives and takes pride in this country."
1,If you sign up - expect to fight,"After having a college education paid for in return for military service, all you get from this book is whining about having to do what he signed up for. I guess he did not hear"" ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country"".In addition to a somewhat poorly written book that jumps all over the place you get the usual ""those in command did not know how to run the war"". After reading this I know the author certainly did not have a clue!"
4,How a soldier got stuck in Iraq for 1 plus years.,"I liked this book, but I am surprised by the fact the author blames the military for his time in Iraq. As one of the previous authors noted, getting stuck in far away places at poor times is just one of the reasons why the military profession is a difficult job. However, I enjoyed the stories about the initial invasion and occupation of Iraq. These stories show how the soldiers lost the hearts and minds of the civilians when they looted and stole from Iraqis. It is hard when Crawford shows how his friendship with a young Iraqi women probably resulted in her, and her family becoming victims.This is a tell all book. There are some light hearted moments and some very serious and sad situations. I am sorry the author's marriage didn't last through his deployment, but the book is a tangible object to show for his suffering."
1,Soldiers won't enjoy this book,"I read this book while in Afghanistan. John Crawford is a whiny dirtbag who couldn't handle one deployment without being a valium drugged, self-pitying cry baby."
3,Family Fun,I thought this movie was very entertaining and a great family movie to watch with your kids.
4,Great Family Movie,"This is a great family movie if you have young children and don't want violent or obseen images waking your children up at night. The first five minutes might be slightly scary (just because of the music, and it's dark, and noises are unknown at the time). After that, PERFECT."
3,FRANK dvd,This was a okay movie. I bought this after watching the air bud movie but it just wasn't the same.
1,Not worth the money!,"The stones were lightweight, and the words were not carved into them; instead, they were just printed on--and not very well either. The words on two of my stones were faded. The accompanying book contained a haphazardly compiled collection of quotes, and provided no insight to the use of wishing stones. Definitely one of the more lame kits made by Running Press. Puppychu made a wish on the stones, and nothing happened. He was extremely disappointed. The black ""velvet"" drawstring pouch is the only redeeming part of this kit, and can be used to hold other small items. Overall, this kit is not worth anybody's time or money!"
4,Great for terrariums!,"Although the words were printed a bit haphazardly on a couple of the stones, these worked beautifully for my CHristmas terrarium project. They were fairly inexpensive and all of my recipients loved them."
5,"amazing oscar winning film - coming to DVD Fall, 2010!",this is a super powerful documentary film - it won the Oscar for best documentary of 1988. i have an old VHS of the film - but i read it is finally coming out on DVD this fall i will buy another copy for sure. you should see it when you can.
2,Howlin' Wolf: The Chess Box,"Unfortunately, the discs would not play normally in my CD player, as most songs skipped around on each disc. It's a great collection of incredible music; I just couldn't hear a lot of it."
5,I love Ryka!,"I own three pair of Ryka shoes, each pair gets better and better. The fit is made for a woman's foot. I am on my feet, in my Ryka's, all day at work but my feet would never tell you this. After work, my Ryka's and I head to the gym. I will not buy any other shoes, I only wish Ryka would make a dress shoe."
3,Not really sure,"I have owned 2 pairs of Ryka Versa MaryJanes in the passed and been quite pleased with them. The only fault I had with them was that the velcro wore out pretty quickly. Other than that, they were super comfortable and supportive. This pair...not so much. Great velcro, but not the comfort and support that I appreciated about my previous 2 pairs. Frankly, I'm a little disappointed."
5,Great shoe!,"These were my second pair of Ryka Mary Jane Walking Shoes. Unfortunately the velcro on the straps of my previous pair of shoes wore out for some reason, and the strap would not stay closed--maybe because I wore them while traveling in Greece, where it was very hot. So, I wanted to replace them and thought I'd try again since I really like the comfortable fit, support, and look. They're sort of stylish, and go well with jeans, hiking pants, and sweats. Also, love the blue rather than the black, that I had before.Core Strength Crosstrainer Shoe"
5,Pleased Customer,"I got my item within a very reasonable amount of time, which was great, because my item was a Christmas present for my husband and it needed to be here before Christmas! Thank you for your timelyness (spelling??)."
2,Men's suspender,"I am disappointed about this product. In the first place, it is very easy to put on, and once I got it on, it was not very comfortable. I think because it is made of heavy canvas, It is too stiff to wear for a long period of time."
5,suspenders,"great, husband loves them. when you put them on they stay on. others may come unfastened but this stay put"
4,valve model does not match illustration,"If you need a ""side outlet"" fuel valve (033305-10) as shown in illustration don't order this valve.You will receive a three way fuel valve with a ""bottom outlet"" (033302-10). The valve I received worked fine but I had to orient it with the handle differently than the side outlet valve I was replacing.Amazon customer service did a great job responding to my problem and I noticed they have a disclamer on the illustration now."
4,sent it back,This is a well built product it just was to large for my application so I returned it.B Hanson
5,I LOVE THESE GUYS! THEY ROCK!,"I love the Waco Brothers. They are just some great, no frills rock and roll. I also love WACO WORLD and ELECTRIC WACO CHAIR. I know a lot of ""purists"" love the older discs. I dig those too but these newer cds have better songs and the better production does their music justice. Big thumbs up. I feel lucky to know their music. Am I gushing enough for you?"
5,Alan Doughty(Bass Extrodinaire),"I got interested in the Waco Brothers strangely enough through my love of Jesus Jones. ...I never have heard mention of the fantastic musicionship of bassist Alan Doughty, also in Jesus Jones. This cd is great, possibly their best to date. As you listen to this great cd turn up the bass on your stereo and enjoy Al Jaworski I mean Alan Doughty's fantastic contribution to this band."
5,A voice as smooth as Sinatra,"I first heard Jamie Cullum on a popular British talk show a couple of months ago and he absolutely blew me away. I quickly purchased this CD and I wasn't disappointed. All the tracks are fantastic with superb arrangements on the classic tunes. The title track Twentysomething was written by Jamie and is great as well.He reminds me of Harry Connick Jr., but better and more original. It's hard to believe he's only 23.Too bad there are no samples of the songs from this CD. Try the Amazon.co.uk website."
5,Jamie Cullum is one of a kind,I flew out to LA a few years ago just to see Jamie live. Fabulous! I have all his cd's and his DVD. All a must. His audience ranges from 8 to 90. Last time I saw him was in Miami. Great performer.
5,My husband loves it!,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. Since I'm not the one using it, it's hard to do a review. I asked him how he likes it. He loves it! I mean really loves it. He says it's powerful. He love the battery time, charge time and power of the saw. I say the thing better be amazing since it's so expensive! When I bought this on Amazon it was at least $200 cheaper than at Lowes or Home Depot! So basing this on my husbands happiness & my happiness at saving some money vs. the store, I'd say this worth buying!"
1,horrible,"amazon shipped me a box that had bubble wrap and a packing list, didnt even get the battery. otherwise i would be here telling you about how great it was and how fast the shipping was, but alas, i recieved an empty box. i plan to take this up with amazon"
4,Nice package...,"This DVD is rare nowadays (because in the 21st century there are STILL people who get easily offended by brief nudity) but if you can snag a copy please do so. These movies do not necessarily represent 'good' science fiction (by any means) but if you are looking for a couple of fun nostalgic pictures then you couldn't do better than these. Bless Warner Bros. for finally putting them out; now if we can only get the Puritans to stop pulling them off the shelves, everyone can enjoy the Dinosaurs!"
4,An engaging glimpse into the glory and mayhem of Apple,Follow the Newton from conception to birth. It's a facinating look at how creativity and business clash and merge to form a unique product for profit. Our post-Newton perspective only serves to make the story more poignant.
5,"Realy Funky, Really Good",Jack Irons has no fear of experimentation and his drumming style is unique(No Code). This is a really good rythm focused CD.
2,not worth it,"First, if you're looking for a sound that resembles Pearl Jam then it's not here, not even close. Eddie Vedder does sing on 'shine on you crazy diamond' and Stone and Flea make some contributions but the album never captures you. It's actually a collection of beats that get old. If you know 'in my tree' from pearl jam, then the whole albums basic sound and rhythm sound like that. He tries to pack the songs with too many sounds that are borrowed from music that's characteristic of sound from all ends of the world. Some may actually appreciate it for its different style, but if you're looking for Rock or Alternative then look elsewhere...I would recommend Stone's album, amazing."
2,It's definitely the Jack Irons show,"I purchased the CD thinking that the collection of talent brought together would create some very interesting and great music. No doubt Jack Irons has talent of his own, but he has the Carter Beauford syndrome of always being the center of attention and not blending with the other quite capable musicians. To his credit, the ability to incorporate many instruments is impressive and he was successful in creating a very unique sound. The names on this CD seem to be there for marketing purposes and very little to do with influencing the music.If your a Les Claypool fan, the Frog Brigades version of ""Shine on your crazy diamond"" which gives credit to the ""Jack Irons version"" is NOTHING like the version on this CD."
5,A necessary book for all women,"As a registered nurse I highly recommend this book. It is excellent for the professional as well as one not in the medical field. It is absolutely necessary to take charge of one's own medical problems and bring the contents of this book to the attention of your physician. There is an answer in this book for every woman and the problems we have encountered without adequate results. My daughter, an MD, used many of her suggestions in a presention to OB/GYN physicians and was amazed at how much of this infomation was not known to them! This is a must for every female's library."
4,Women's health,This book was great for helping me get the nerve to face the issues I needed to face. It let me know how to face some issues with confidence. A good book for anyone who is facing issues that they can't seem to get across to the medical profession.
3,I found I couldn't sustain my interest in this book.,I would recommend SCREAMING... to a younger woman who is facing menopause. The information was not of much interest to me as I am in my seventies and have had both a hysterectomy and oofverectomy.
5,This book changed my life!!,"I learned more about my body - and hormonal connections - in this book than I have ever known (age 42!). I did go to Dr. Vliet's clinic -- with fantastic ongoing results.However, her goal is NOT to get you into her clinic -- it's to educate women about their bodies -- so that when you walk into your doctor's office you KNOW what you're talking about -- and can ask for very specific blood-tests. We have to be very PRO-ACTIVE in our health care these days -- and every woman needs to have the information in this book."
4,La Guzman en su mejor momento,"Alejandra Guzmán está en su mejor momento en esta grabación grabada en vivo en Cancún, Méjico. LA Guzmán tine una gran fuerza interpretativa y su voz y proyección está mejor que nunca. Su set acústico donde canta tres de sus mejores éxitos es una de las mejores canciones. Esta reina de corazones seguirá reinando por mucho tiempo."
5,Journey for or with your power animal,"I make weekly or bi-weekly personal tune-ups using this CD. Initially, I used the journey to find my power animal -- a relationship I'm still exploring, but the metaphor of that relationship is quite powerful, and helpful in my life. Now I use the same journey CD, but go on soul retrievals, or on expeditions with my power animal to find an answer to a specific question. The results have been surprising: useful, grounding, information or sensation-packed. I appreciate the format of the CD; the ability to have a ""voice"" and ""format"" to follow, and a call back at the end. Not to mention great drumming. I highly recommend this investment."
1,Too Much Talk,"Maybe it's my own fault. I thought I was ordering a CD with a major component of drumming only. When I received the CD I was disappointed to find that the woman talked through much of the first two sections on the CD. I'm sure if you are looking for an oral guided journey, you might be able to use this one, but I was disappointed in too much talk."
1,table,This is not a side table! This is way too small to be next to a bed or chair (unless for small children's furniture). The design on the top makes the table look cheap.
4,Great pack,"I really like this pack. It was very nice and it came before the expected time. In the pack, I received a Team Rockets Sneak Attack Trainer card that is a Holo and I'm very happy with it so overall I enjoyed this pack and definitely would buy it again."
1,i got screwed ! They did not have the item!,"I ordered the textbook on a Tuesday. Friday, I go to check my e-mail, and the seller stated that he had to refund the money because he didn't have the item in stock. So, you would think that sucks. I'll go and check to see if there are any others online. Then i go to check the item has increased from 55 to 80...I WAS PISSED! I needed the book and needed to save money. I then had to spend $100 on the book. I WOULD NOT recommend this vendor at all!"
2,:sigh:,"Elementary Statistics was the book required for my class this semester and let me tell you - IT SUCKS!This book pulls numbers out of thin air constantly and instead of telling you how to apply (or come up with) a formula it will just say something like ""use a calculator to find ______""I honestly learned more from google than from this book, and can't figure out why someone would make this required reading material for any class."
2,"Student Solutions Manual for Elementary Statistics-Picturing the World, 4th edition",I am disappointed with the solutions manual. There are too many problems that have only the answer instead of the steps to solve the problem. Students who are taking online or distance classes need the step-by-step solution of the problems.
4,All the answers,Just what I expected.And it has a recipe for a great pizza. I only with it would have had an apple pie.
5,"Webb Wilder's Latest CD ""About Time""","We caught Webb at the Coffe Pot in Roanoke on Saturday, March 4, 2006. There were only about 100 people, but man what a show. He sang five or six from his new cd ""About Time"". The crowd went nuts when he sang ""Looking for a Fool"".You need to purchase this CD and enjoy Webb over and over. The mix of ballads and rock-a-billy is typical Webb and the sound gets in your soul and won't let go. Try it, you will not regret this great American Icon.Richard (Mike) Furey, Blacksburg, Va."
2,Applied.NOT,"This book's title is misleading, as it appears to feed off the familiarity with the Applied Programming series of books from Microsoft Press. It is truly a mixed-bag, as the above editorial review admits. After expounding on the 'revolutionary' idea that software should be people oriented, it dives into pages of code that lays out an Asp.Net application. It then sandwiches in a C# fundamentals tour, and then dives right into more code. If there is a purpose to this book, I couldn't distill it. It truly appears as if each author wrote their portion of their book without talking to the other, and then the editor mashed them together the night before the deadline hit."
2,Night Tales,"I don't know what it is about this series, but all the females in these Night stories are such snots. They're rude, conceited, snotty, and unlikeable. What do these guys see in them? I liked Ryan a lot, he was so sexy and mysterious, but Natalie was an outright biotch to him. She needed a serious attitude adjustment. I couldn't stand how she talked to him like she was so much better than him."
4,Night Smoke,"Night Smoke was an awesome book. It had a great storyline and was a definate page turner. This Book had my attention from the beginnning. Once I got going I couldn't stop, which says a lot for Nora Roberts, considering this was my least favorite.She is a great author who always comes up with good romance novels. I can't wait to read the next Night Tale, ""Night Shield."""
3,a good first effort,i found this cd in a used store and picked it up after reading a review of it... Its quite good -- very indie rock sounding but the writing is pretty strong. Make a Dent and Grey Brick Walls are standout tracks but there are no real weak ones here. I would be curious to hear them with a good producer.
4,well made and good fit,very well made and perfect fit with my other nomination charms for considerably less money
2,WAAAYYYYYYY TOO WORDY !,"As required college reading for a Latin American History course, this book was painfully long and overly wordy. Filled with descriptions on every page, the actual important facts must be navigated by the reader, making note-taking difficult and compounding the problem of ""what's important"" and ""what's just fluff"" that every student undergoes.My advice from the Professor who wholeheartedly agreed with my frustration was to skip a lot of the superfluous babble and attempt to skim for the valuable information.All in all, Crow is an historian, and enjoys lengthy dissertations. A good choice if you have LOADS of time on your hands and nothing else to read or do for a while.A much better choice for crisp and concise facts on the Central and South American regions is MODERN LATIN AMERICA by Thomas Skidmore and Peter Smith."
4,terrific,"A comprehensive look at various historical and cultural elements of Latin America. I appreciate the scholarly, yet easy-to-read approach. Refreshing in its story-oriented approach to detail."
4,"As 919-page history books go, this one is very readable!","Generally, this is a very comprehensive and enjoyable summary of Latin American history, starting with the Mayas, the Incas and the Aztecs. It provides particularly helpful insight on the development of government and cultural traditions. The first two hundred years of history following the European arrival in the Americas is particularly enjoyable reading, because of the storytelling style. The 19th century and 20th century history is a little tougher sledding, at times a little disjointed and perhaps long on opinion. I would have also expected more coverage on the Caribbean, especially Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. That said, this was a good read from the perspective of someone who frequently doesn't enjoy history books."
1,On Brazil utter nonsense,"This book is laughable with regard to Brazil about which the author apparently knows very little. He is cited as an ""authority"" for example in the Wikipedia article on Tome de Sousa, but the article in Wiki is full of silly nonsense. I presume it came from Crow."
4,JUST LIKE THE TITLE SAYS,"JUST LIKE THE TITLE SAYS, THIS IS A CD OF RARE AND WELL DONE RECORDINGS BY BO DIDDLEY. NOT HIS MOST WELL KNOWN SONGS, IN FACT, ONLY FIVE OF THESE SONGS WERE EVER RELEASED, THE OTHER ELEVEN WERE UNRELEASED AND WERE RECORDED BETWEEN 1955-1968. BUT IF YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME GREAT BO DIDDLEY (WHO DOESN'T?), THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD."
4,Insanity in the Peruvian jungle,"""Burden of Dreams"" recounts film director Werner Herzog's insane project to film ""Fitzcarraldo"". The project is continually dogged by disasters and the obsessive requirements of Herzog himself. The documentary-makers record the events in an impressionistic fashion, giving one a real sense of the otherworldy atmosphere of filming in the Peruvian jungle.The DVD includes a throwaway item ""Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe"" on Herzog's support of Errol Morris's ""Gates of Heaven""."
2,"Eh, Not My Thing","My boyfriend wanted to watch this with me, I didn't care for it. I found it dry and dull, and rather depressing. But to be fair, I have no interest in this subject matter. If you do, I imagine you would find it much more enjoyable than I did."
2,fitfully interesting,"Like the movie, this documentary is overpraised. Like the movie, it is intelligently done, but is overlong. I personally saw it largely because I'm a Stones fan, and I wanted to see Mick Jagger in the part that he couldn't complete because he had to go do the Stones 1981 tour. I thought I'd get to see Mick between shots, talking about making the movie. But there Mick is only in the documentary briefly, when clips from scenes he did with Jason Robards are shown. It IS a shame, as Herzog says, that Mick had to leave the movie, because, from these short clips, he does appear to act effectively, and had a charisma that comes across (surprising, because Jagger was so bland, and acted so poorly in the more recent FREEJACK). But the Mick clips are only a few seconds each, and I used the fastforward button for a lot of the rest of the movie."
4,Classic songs,"This compilation is Lowell Fulson at his finest, the songs that make him an essential blues artist. Reconsider Baby and Check Yourself are worth having in your collection just by themselves. The Blues Foundation is recognizing this album as a Classic of Blues as part of their 2010 Hall of Fame celebration. One caveat--the last song, Tollin' Bells is a series of fits and starts as Lowell and the producer try to find the best take--not essential but maybe interesting for hard-core fans--the only reason I did not give the record five stars."
2,Not bad.....,"well, this is an ok gun. my first one crapped out in about 3 shots, my second one crapped out in about a month, kinda suckd. it was very good while it lasted..."
4,Free Read,"Excellent book for history readers.Without having to spend a fortune for reading material,amazon.com has a good selection of downlaods for free."
4,Re The Guns of Shiloh,"This book is obviously written for a youthful audience, I would say, as an excellent introduction or supplement to an interest in the Civil War. It could be considered a Civil War version of ""Johnny Tremain,"" the very popular novel about the American Revolution where the ""hero"" is a young man. Nonetheless, as with ""Johnny Tremain,"" the story is well written, historically accurate and interesting to adults as well. I looked up maps of the battles on the internet as I read it and that greatly added to my enjoyment and understanding of the descriptions."
5,Stretching the Ridiculous!,"Even children realize that waiting for a log to rot is foolish, but of course it is a marvelous lesson in using wisdom and not always being a ""yes civet""."
2,Not clear,"This book might be useful to explore some actual production process cases, but it doesn't feel like the author understood what he wrote about. The process descriptions are not clear."
4,An Australian View Point,"As an Australian who lived for three and a half years in Quebec, I found this book very useful to show my friends here in Brisbane what I have told them is true. This book is invaluable because we in Australia are not only geographically a million miles away from Quebec we are a million miles ahead, and Mordecai Richler has cpatured everything that is Quebec. This book is a must for those trying to understand the psyche of the Quebecoir."
2,"Oh Canada, Oh Québec, Oh Brother...","I was hoping that this book would be interesting since I find the Québec Separatism Movement to be one of the most fascinating things of recent politics. Well, I was wrong. I found this book to be extremely dry, I fell asleep a few times while reading it. I got annoyed with the fact that Richler kept bring Anti-Semitism into it. I understand his point of view, but I did not buy this book to read about Anti-Semitism, I bought it to read about the relations between Canada and Québec. Richler does get a plus because he at least explained things for the benefit of American readers, which was great or else I would be totally lost. He also gets a plus because he fully explains Québec's language laws. Overall, I was not too impressed with the book, I found it to be long, drawn out, and hopelessly boring."
5,Of course 5 stars.,How should I put this...?subtle? historic? passionate? Let's just leave it at this.IT'S A 4 CD BOX WITH BLUES FROM CHESS!! THAT'S MUDDY WATERS AND HOWLING WOLF!! DUH!!! OF COURSE 5 STARS!!
3,Umm...,This would make a great show if the replays were cut. More time is spent on replays than on the actual chases!
4,Paddling Minnesota is a great resource guide!,Paddling through Minnesota with Greg is a delighful trip. I've been using Paddling Northern Wisconsin as a guide and now I have two wonderful guides and lots of rivers to cross!!!
3,Ok,This book is great for giving you ideas for places to go but the maps are terrible. None of them are usable for navigation.
4,Beautiful EP,Cobra is one of my favorite songs by My morning Jacket and it just sounds amazing on vinyl. A great record to jam out with
4,Good business sense!,I found this book very insightful not only about the life of Mr. Penny but also into his way of doing business. The way he opened up new stores by offering the new store to one of his employees as a partner was very interesting. Lots of wisdom for business. Although the book is somewhat expensive I personally thought it was worth it.
5,Excellent!,"Von Frickle rocks!! The music on this CD abounds with odd time signatures, multiple changes in tempo and dynamics (from a speed-metal type groove to a softer jazzy song to electronic noise with tape loops), angular guitar chords, classic Moog and Farfisa synths, and much instrumental virtuosity.Take a liberal dose of King Crimson, mix in some Ozric Tentacles, add one heaping tablespoon of Krautrock, sprinkle with a smidgen of surf music (not to mention some decidedly un-bluesy slide guitar work), and you have one of the most interesting instrumental progressive rock bands of the new millenium. These guys have chops to burn, and consequently Von Frickle smokes on this release.In a world where there are many 'new' progressive artists attempting to re-hash old prog-rock cliches, Von Frickle carves out a niche of their own, not being afraid to wear their influences on their sleeves at the same time."
5,Progressive rock lives!,"A must hear record in the spirit of Lark's Tongue era King Crimson, but done in an all instrumental manner. Von Frickle is mersmerizing and Lee Fehr's guitar sound is hi-tech all the way. Progressive rock lives in the millennium!!!"
1,Totally flawed product,New battery would not accept charge and did not easily install or deinstall.Total disappointment.
4,"Who, Sir? Me, Sir?","I think 'Who, Sir? Me, Sir?' is interesting. This story is easy to understand, fun, and has the points for thinking. You will feel you would like to be Sam's students. You will want to have friends and activities as this story. Finally, you will know you can do it if you try."
5,oldies but goodies,"The packaging was excellent, the delivery very prompt. Would do business with this vendor again. It was a pleasure."
4,What a pleasant surprise!,"I never could have imagined that this batch of new songs from The Kings could be this good. Of course they are mostly (only?) known for their album, ""The Kings Are Here"" and specifically, ""This Beat Goes On/Switchin to Glide"". After 25 years to produce something that sounds this good, this fresh is truly amazing. Nothing fancy here. Maybe no instant classic in the mode of ""Glide"", but overall this is a better record than ""The Kings Are Here"". Just good old solid guitar driven rock. It doesn't get much better than this!"
3,Not as described.,This did not come with the blending tip as described.It does not last very long and I have to continuously re-apply throughout the evening.
2,Needs Revision,"This book needs to be edited and revised so that the language presented flows on a smoother gradient from simple to complex. It begins very simply and ends with a story containing a great deal of grammatical complexity, most of which has not been explained or presented. Also, it is impossible with the data given in the course to do some of the exercises. I found it very frustrating. Its greatest feature, however, is Charley Jones as a native speaker."
2,El Jardin de la CUEC,"Felipe Cazals, engresado del Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematograficos, fue integrante de ese peque~o grupo de jovenes cineastas conocidos como el ""New Wave"" o Nueva Onda del cine mexianco que incluye a Jorge Fons, Sergio Olhovich, etc. EL JARDIN DE TIA ISABEL (o EL JARDIN DE LA TIA ISABEL), fue el primer largo metraje de Cazals, estrenado en 1971.Una tripulacion de soldados espa~oles, curas y prostitutas (una combinacion rara por cierto) llega al Mundo Nuevo. En el transcurso de la pelicula, hay conflictos (unos claros y otros no tanto) y mueren los personajes por distantas causas y la pelicula resulta ser una historia de sobrevivencia. Es interesante al principio pero creo que fue mal ejecutada. La historia nunca tiene un punto fijo a donde ir y poco suspenso.La transicion de video a DVD no esta muy buena en esta edicion."
3,Good but not great,I used this to remove patchy hair growth on my face. Best used in conjunction with a hair removal cream to reduce possibility of ingrown hairs.I've been using this product for a few months now and it helped thin out hair in about 30% of the area applied to but is still struggling with the thicker areas of hair growth. I have definitely seen some improvement but not the complete hair removal I was looking for. It's definitely worth a spin if your hair is thin to begin with. Remember to give it at least a month to see results.I'll continue to use until the bottle runs out and see where I end up.
1,Not Very Good,"This is a pretty pedestrian made-for-TV movie. The mountain scenery is pretty, but there is really no reason to watch this movie."
4,Winter Kill,I enjoyed the mystery series years ago. I really liked this one. When it came out I had to have it!!! The whole family watches it weekly.
4,Sounds Great,"I havent actually purchused this CD yet, but I fully intend to. ive heard tid bits here and there and its gourgous lush music. AS a college student majoring in Music I know good stuff hwen I hear it. This relaxing sound has had me counting down the days til the CD release along with the movie and the book has kept me occupied this past month. I encourge anyone who likes celtic music and the works of Enya and Emigma to purchuse this. Its great to listen to around bed time."
3,"Great music, but the songs are too short","I loved the movie and the music. This is the first soundtrack I have purchased. Perhaps all soundtrack CD's are the same, as soundtracks are created for film and not for commercial consumption, but the songs are WAY too short. It is so frustrating to listen to beautiful music that lasts for only a minute. There are 22 songs on the CD and the CD lasts for about 37 minutes."
3,As expected.,"The book was for school, I got out of it what I put into it meaning it covered the bases when and where i needed them."
4,review my review,"It is my course book. The book provides complete information about the subject. Unfortunately there are many spelling mistakes, and moreover the English of the book is somewhat odd."
3,good dvd but the sound quality is horrible,"this dvd had some really good concert footage(the black my heart footage is amazing)it's just the sound quality is really bad. sound quality aside you get to see job for a cowboy when thier bassist still looked 15, winds of plage tear it up, and the warrior make everyone kill eachother. but i'd only recomend if you were a big fan of some of the bands on the disc."
5,Love ZZ Top's music!,"Very nice sound on this CD. Great mix of their career. I could think of a few songs I would have liked to see on it... Ten Foot Pole, Manic Mechanic, Breakaway, Concrete & Steel, & Give It Up.You could take back Velcro Fly (12"" Remix), Legs (Dance Mix), Cheap Sunglasses (Live), Viva Las Vegas & Woke Up With Wood. I will trade you 5 for 5!!Over all, nice collection. Thank you ZZ Top for years of great rock & blues."
4,+ 1/2 stars...A Thoroughly Satisfying Career Retrospective,"Although it is not the hits-intensive package that 1992's GREATEST HITS was, this two-disc retrospective does a solid job of covering ZZ Top's 20-year career on Warner Bros. from 1970's ZZ TOP'S FIRST ALBUM to 1990's RECYCLER.In addition to early hits like ""La Grange"" and ""Tush,"" there are, of course, the mid-eighties MTV hits like ""Gimme All Your Lovin',"" ""Sharp Dressed Man"" and the original single version of ""Legs."" [GREATEST HITS included a remix version.] The album closes with a rousing live version of ""Cheap Sunglasses"" from 1980, but the dance mix of ""Legs"" and the 12"" remix of ""Velcro Fly"" leave a bad taste in an otherwise stellar collection of big hits and strong album cuts.All in all, it's a matter of how big a fan you are. If you want more than the 18-track GREATEST HITS but don't want to spring for the 4-disc box set CHROME, SMOKE & BBQ, then RANCHO TEXICANO is exactly what you're looking for. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
5,Makes me wanna put on a fake beard and learn guitar,What can i say about this band that hasn't already been said? Nothing. If your a fan you already have all of these songs. However if you ever played guitar hero and wanted to hear some more of ZZ Top then you have found the holy grail. This album has pretty much every hit they had on it and the price is right.
5,Great Collection,This is a great collection of great ZZ Top music. A must have for any ZZ Top fan. One of the best 'Best of....' collections out there!
5,Top rated ZZ Top,"Rancho Texicano, has 38 cuts of the best of ZZ Top, from ""Cheap Sunglasses"" to ""She's got Legs"" makes any cruising trip, kayak paddling, or just sit back and revel in the pleasure of pure ZZ genius, last for hours."
3,"same thing as chrome, smoke and bbq","unless rhino is going to put out the zz top catalog in the near future remastered with original mixes unlike the six pack collection, this set was a waste of time. everything that's on here is on the box set. most die hard fans have already bought the box set and it's four disc so more for your money. i guess if you didn't buy the box set yet this would be the way to go but, most people do have it."
3,great collection,"Meant to rate it 4 1/2 stars...not perfect, but very good. Unfortunately, I hit the three star button. This set is better than three stars.Great collection of songs. Though some are missing from various albums. Like ""Need You Tonight"" and ""Thug"" from Eliminator aren't on this CD set, but it's a very good set."
2,"Musically it's interesting, but the lyrics frequently stink.","Title says it all. I was really liking their sound for pretty much all the tracks, but nearly half the tracks have disappointing lyrics. Sometimes the music is too xtian, other times (more times) the music is too disrespectful to women."
2,Another Miss by ZZ Top,"What's a ""best of"" ZZ Top release without fantastic songs like ""Give it Up"" and ""Nasty Dogs and Funky Kings?"" The answer is...""Not much!"" I keep hoping they'll get it right someday."
4,Wonderful Wine Rack,"This is an excellent wine rack for the price. It is a beautiful and classy dark cherry color with black accents and rungs for the bottles. It has a carrying bar at the top but I wouldn't recommend using that while there are wine bottles in it (it just doesn't feel sturdy enough...and who wants to risk breaking 6 bottles!) It is cheapened a little by the plastic caps that cover the screws but so what, no one can see them. This is small enough to work well in any space and would be a wonderful house-warming gift (or with this price, an anyday gift for yourself). I definitely recommend this wine rack to anyone."
5,Wonderful and inspiring tale,"It's easy to love this book, whether you're even a casual boater or a landlubber. Mr. Rubin gives some great insights into his life and the reasons why one makes the choices they make. I read the opening about him building the small boat as a child to my wife, who absolutely was entranced by the images. Even though I live near one of the Great Lakes instead of the Atlantic Ocean, ""messing about in boats"" is one of the greatest joys in life, which the author has aptly demonstrated in this book."
4,Ok condition,"Arrived in a fair amount of time. The book was a little bit more beat up than I expected, but appreciative nonetheless to find it and purchase it."
3,V. Majestic - self-titled (Edge Records),"Interesting sounding ten track CD from this experimental / neo-psychedelia / Avant Garde artist. Looks to be V. Majestic's sole effort. Wasn't able to locate much info at all on the Internet. Tunes I liked best include ""I Was Kicked In The Horse By A Head When I was Three"" [definitely, one of the longest song titles I've ever encountered], ""That's Entropy"", the downright insane ""Freudis Sexualis, Parts 1 And 2"", ""The Grand Substitution"" and the eight-minute ""Open Casket (For Tiny)"". Recommended for fans of Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart, Faust and maybe Can."
3,"Interesting ,but You Need to be Motivated","I'll keep this short. Reading the author's ""Thank You"" section, one is clued in that the book was initiated as a request by the The Naval Institute. There is nothing wrong with that, but it completely comes across that the book is more research paper than real biography. For those interested in background on one of the founders of computers and data processing, its a nugget, but one that also could be obtained if we just put the relevant facts on a few pages of a .pdf document. Kathleen Broome's imprint is her continuous comparison of Adm. Hooper's perception of the role / success of women in the computing field to what contemporary history would say. On the positive side, is some excellent background on the origins of COBOL. It's OK but you really have to want to read about Grace."
3,Replacement PC Battery,My PC says that this new battery is less than it was rated and that I should expect 30% shorter life when used it. I thought that I was getting a longer life battery.
1,bad quality battery,"Just over 30 days the battery died. The warranty for the battery is 30 days. my lesson is when you shop for laptop battery, look for battery with more than 6 month warranty."
1,No accent marks on pronuncation,"Chinese is a ""tonal"" language meaning there are high tones, low tones, rising/falling tones, etc. The tones can make a word mean completely different things. There is a complete lack of accent marks on the pronuncation key! I don't recommend this book."
4,LOTS OF FUN,My family found a number of fun projects in this book. We'd been thinking about ways to accent our flower beds and found useful project in this book. We created some different birdhouses as well as a few paths throughout the garden. We very pleased with the results.
1,Just not happening,"The music is too cosmopolitinish, I hear too much Lenny Kravitz and other influences that do not make it his own sound. Sure it is catchy. That makes me not like it that much more..... He will probably be doing songs for Toyota just like his twin Lenny someday. Anything to make a buck huh?? Definitley do not think the band needs to be named after Paul, he is not the star!!"
5,THIS CD ROCKS!,"I have to say thank you to my friend Jen for turning me on to Paul and his band. This cd hasn't left the changer yet. It has this lo-fi underground quality to it. very 60's, very today though, just genius. P.S. see them live"
5,AN AWESOME STORY!! (Sequal to the Rising),"The Rising was one heck of a book. Keene grabs your attention and keeps it all the way to the end. Can't say too many books do that. The story is easy to follow and very realistic. After reading The Rising, I couldn't wait to jump into CITY OF THE DEAD(the sequel). BOTH BOOKS ROCK!!! THIS IS 100% NOT A TYPICAL ZOMBIE STORY CONTRARY TO PREVIOUS REVIEWS!! This Zombie style is new to me, and yet the zombies arent the typical slow stupid slugs, THIS MAKES IT EVEN MORE TERRIFYING. While the story is quite graphic and VERY DISTURBING in parts, I guess if I were a zombie, I wouldn't care about who or what I killed either. BRIAN KEENE IS A MASTER OF HORROR!!!"
1,Just walk away.,"I had my Iron Chef America moment and put this book down and walked away from the book, series, and author after one of the characters commits a sex act with a captive zombie. Over the line. Too much. Unnecessary. I read the first book in this series, The Rising, and liked it ok, even though I was not particularly thrilled with the possessed style of zombie and the concept of animal zombies. I always love the initial zombie outbreaks and the descent of civilization into chaos.This book starts out ok with the end of Jim's quest to find his son. After that initial scene, the continuous gore did get tedious. When I reached the scene mentioned above, I stopped reading. I usually can't get enough of zombie stories, but this was more than enough. If you are looking for a good zombie read, check out J.L Bourne's Day By Day Armageddon, Recht's Morningstar Strain series, Brooks' World War Z, and Frater's As the World Dies series. Those are the best I've read so far."
3,Perhaps a 2 1/2 (2 seemed harsh),"I loved The Rising. City of The Dead, the sequel to The Rising, was a bit of a let down. Though it contains similar action scenes and gorry descriptions to the first novel, the way Keene develops the plot loses The Rising's darkness and mystery, becoming almost cheesy by comparison. Perhaps it was a plot best left to the imagination; perhaps, by the time the plot proved to have little potential, too much was invested to start over; or perhaps I couldn't be more wrong and simply have poor taste. Without ruining the plot, I will say only that the dark and evil forces from first novel turned into silly things with lame vocabularies. In spite of grandiose plans, the bad guys seemed more focused on handguns and buildings than weapons and countries."
2,Not Mr. Keene's Best Book.,"I read all of Mr. Keene's other books first and after reading COTD, I was glad I did. I didn't think this novel compared to his other books, way, way, too dark and depressing. That said, if you want upbeat and happy don't be reading horror books right? But Mr. Keene does it MUCH better in his other books, managing the horror but still not totally turning the reader off. Which he did with me in COTD.The zombies in this book aren't traditional shabby, shuffling, not-too-swift both physically and mentally ""zombies"". They are more demons inhabiting the dead bodies. They make for quick action sequences but how do you outwit them? That's the depressing part.Check out Dead Sea, Ghoul, or even Conquerer Worms; all by Mr. Keene and save this one for last."
4,Did Romero Rip-Off Keene A Bit?,"""The Rising"" was fantastic, it didn't really need a sequel but this book was an enjoyable roller-coaster ride of zombie holocaust.The chief demon Ob and his underling demonic zombies started getting a little silly towards the end (in a Schwartzeneggar action/thiller type of way), but that ending chilled one's bones and -I'm not kidding- brought a tear to my eyes."
4,Unique Zombie Tale,"This is the sequel to The Rising, one of the better zombie novels of the past few years. The Rising was an average book, with lots of borrowing from classic post apocalyptic tales. Especially McCammon's Swan Song. Keene's zombies are unique, in the fact that dead rise because they are being possessed by cross dimensional demon's that were accidentally released in a failed science experiment. These zombies are relatively intelligent and able to work together. City of the Dead is an upgrade from the first book. The characters are more fleshed out, and less whiney. They've had the time to adjust to the new world, and are starting to figure things out. Keene takes the opportunity to look at human evil and human triumph in this tale, and expand the spiritual concepts the first book only hinted at."
1,A pointless follow-up to a terrible first novel,I guess some people enjoy crappy writing and reading about characters that you don't care about dying horribly. other wise this clumsy piece of trash wouldn't have been written.
1,Makes other bad horror novels look good by comparison,"I randomly picked this up from a used book store, never having heard of Brian Keene, and I was bored with the book within the first 20 pages. Keene is just a bad writer. No, he's a terrible writer. The characters are cardboard, and their dialogue is so very atrocious that it is difficult to believe that Keene has ever heard another human being speak. I didn't expect much of a plot in a book about zombies, but the constant ""protagonists threatened by swarming zombies"" quickly gets boring here. I do like the idea of zombies via demonic possession, but Keene's cheesy dialogue makes the demons as dull as everything else in this book."
5,It doesn't get any better (except for The Rising),"I can't understand how anyone could give this book a bad review. It doesn't get any more fun and exciting than this two book series. He even picks up for more in Dead Sea. People say this is ""not a zombie"" book. I say, the villains were dead and now they are moving and trying to kill the living all while rotting... how much more zombie do you want? Who was really afraid of Romero's zombies anyway? You can run through a mall and punch them in the face for cryin' out loud. Not these guys!! :) Keep 'em coming Mr. Keene!"
2,"Do you like zombies? Do you LOVE zombies? If so, AVOID THIS STINKER AT ALL COSTS.","I truly cannot tell you how much I wish I'd read more reviews before buying this trash.I, like other reviewers, love zombies. I'm talking classic zombies, lumbering around moaning and searching for brains. When a book says to me, ""hey buy me I've got ZOMBIES! Come on you love zombies, look at me I've got like 300 pages and they're PACKED with zombies!"" and then 10 pages in I get ""lol surprise we're talking and organizing and SHOOTING GUNS AND DRIVING CARS HURRR"" it's unforgivable.The book is an interesting read (for trite, contrived writing that's not even up to the""standards"" of S.D. Perry's Resident Evil books, which is pretty shameful) but...ugh I want to slap Brian Keene. Brian Keene, you owe me five bucks, and I'm not kidding."
2,Here's why...,"One star because:it's so stinkin' corny. I don't see the zombie apocalypse happening this way, and I don't see millionaires alerting their bodyguards as to when they want to...well...please themselves (to put it nicely.) I don't see doctors committing sexual acts (by choice) with zombies. It seems to me that Mr. Keene just wanted to write a bunch of crazy stuff in this crazy setting. The zombies being capable of speech makes it less than scary, and I think that's the opposite of what he wanted in writing this book.Two stars because:Bringing a spiritual element into the zombies is a cool twist on it. I also appreciate that he was looking to deviate from the norms of slow-moving, mindless zombies, but at the same time, if they think and reason and speak, they aren't exactly zombies. They're called zombies all through the book, but they're not really. Also, as bad as this book is, I can't bring myself to put it down. It's at least a fun read."
3,Hate the Conclusion of this Book,"After reading the first two in the series, I was compelled to read the third. Others gave the ending less than stellar reviews so I wasn't surprised to be dissatisfied with the conclusion. Keene is a good writer, probably too good, but he's way too graphic for my taste. It didn't stop me from reading all three books although I admit to skimming a few of the cringe worthy scenes. It wasn't the zombie encounters but the cruelty exhibited by humans against other humans that bothered me the most. Keene masterfully brings out the best and worst in human nature, but one would like to think a zombie apocolypse would temper the evilness exhibited by more than a few of his characters."
5,Zombies again!,"the rising was a great great book. as soon as i finished the rising i jumped into ""city..."" once i started the first thing i noticed is that the writing was somewhat different. was it the lack of gore, maybe? the fact that the zombies dialogue isn't in italics? anyways, once i got halfway through the book the brian keene from the rising was back. i love this book, but i love the rising more. this book delves deeper into the reasons why zombies exist and all that. it has more of a supernatural feel than horror, but thats not to say there isn't horrifying things lurking in here. i read this in three days. i've not read that much EVER! i couldn't put it down. together with the rising this is an epic story. keene is a great writer and knows how to grab hold of your throat. if you didn't like the ending of the rising, you might hate the ending in this one. no mas."
3,Unsure zombie theme,"I've read the ""The Rising"" and must confess to loving all things zombie.That being said, I'm not really sold on the zombies in Brian Keene's novels. They're not the typical zombies from the Romero films. Keene has put his own spin on them that they're demons from another dimension inhabiting the dead flesh. Ok, I can sort of live with that.But smart zombies kill the majority of the suspense for me. Shambling zombies to me equate to suspense. Zombies who are smart & cunning just doesn't really work. And while this is well written and thought out, it just didn't work that well for me."
1,Disappointing,I was one of the people pissed off about the ending to The Rising. When I heard Keene was writing a sequel I was looking forward to it. I read this book in one day. City of the dead was a waste of my time and money. I will not be buying another book written by this author.Too many characters are introduced too quickly. They all die and you really can't care that they do.Keene could have gone down an interesting path with the magic idea but instead he did nothing with it. Why even mention it?I would go into more detail about why I dislike this book so much but I do not want to list any more spoilers than I already have.One good thing I can say about it is that unlike several books I have read recently I did not notice any grammar errors.
3,Kept me entertained,"I like this book and if possible would give it 3 1/2 stars. Jim is back and the book starts off beautifully where The Rising left off. I had written everybody off in the first book. There was no way that Martin, Frankie, and Jim survived the herd of zombies that were advancing on them, but they did and Keene made it believable.The talking zombie angle didn't bother me in the first book, but I have to say it did bother me this time. They were too organized, and too smart. Ob's dialogue was way over the top, and still didn't understand why the zombies fed on the bodies they wanted their ""brothers"" to inhabit. It didn't make sense, and it was poorly justified.Still, the action kept me reading. It was fast paced and easy to digest. Keene has a great talent for gore, and violence. This is a great read for horror fans, but zombie fans may be a little disappointed."
5,Fast paced Gore,"Not knowing that the Rising was the 1st instalment, I still continued to read because I could not put it down. I can't wait to read more of Brian's books."
3,Its head exploded and its guts spilled out onto the floor.,"I just finished ""The City of the Dead"" by Brian Keene. It's the second volume in a series of books about a zombie-apocalypse. I think I liked the first one better... The characters didn't really flesh out any more than they already had in the first book; they were basically there to fill out their specific rolls. Over all, the story is entertaining, though Keene's descriptions of gore are tired at this point; there are only so many ways to destroy a zombie's head, and only so many ways to describe how entrails spill out. Granted, I can't say that I disliked the book, and I think I'll read Keene's third installment, ""Dead Sea,"" but I don't see myself investing in anymore of his books any time soon."
3,"Not a ""Zombie"" book","The writing was good, characters were good, but this was not a zombie book. This book was about demonic possession. I guess maybe I'm too much of a traditionalist regarding the ""Romero zombies"".Ending is disappointing but as stated in another review - he's the author and that's how he chose to end it."
4,great sequel to the rising,"Loved this book, wish more detail went into the tower but...,all things considered good sequel."
3,Not As Good As the First One,"Surprise! The sequel is not near as good as the first. You'll have that!I was disappointed in the lack of story concerning the ""zombies"". I thought that the sequel would answer some questions about them and go deeper into where they came from and their purposes. More of the history of them would have been an added bonus.Besides that, the book was entertaining, if not predictable. It ended up being like most all other zombie movies or books. The original outdid itself and was not predictable in this way. It seemed to contain a lot of unnecessary foul language. To a point, when making characters real and believable, this is sometimes necessary, but this went beyond sometimes.If you read The Rising, you should read this one to have some closure, but don't expect too much."
1,Just not good at all,"I did not care for The Rising but I thought I would read the second book to see how the story ended (since the first book kind of cheated you by ending without a resolution). Unfortunately this book was more of the depressing same and maybe a bit worse. The super intelligent demon-zombies (you know the kind that can talk, shoot guns, fly heliocoptors, make wisecracks etc.) and all of the demon-zombie animals (you know all of the dead birds, squirrels, rabbits, rats, alligators, etc.) kill off everybody. I mean, come on, people do not stand a chance in this scenario where every single thing that dies comes back as a demon-zombie and the book is just basically an excuse to gruesomely kill every character that is introduced. Depressing and unenjoyable."
3,Better than the first book,"A 3 and 1/2 star book, City of the Dead, the sequel to The Rising, is a slightly better entry than Keene's first zombie epic. It has all the usual things one would want in this type of genre - incredibly fast paced action, gore galore, lots of death, and some twists to the zombie mythology. Herein lies my one problem with the book. I would be more satisfied to have more mystery about the zombies/demons instead of being told ever single detail about the ""rules"" of why the undead are taking over. The talking zombies with attitude also became slightly annoying. Unlike The Rising, Keene wraps things up very nicely at the end, so I don't think we'll be seeing another sequel. Oh, well, it was fun while it lasted."
2,"Decent writing, silly plot","I like Keene's writing. Terminal was great. The Rising was a miss in my book, and so was this. An over the top, not-so-thrilling ride through descriptions of gore and a silly plot. These arent really zombies, they're demons that take over the world in dead people's bodies. There's a master demon who's as dumb as a duck, and all his forces are evil comic-book cutouts gathering around to do whatever OB the demon master says. This is more funny than serious horror, and I did giggle along the way. But, it's not a horror novel. Not scary in the least. It's a silly book."
1,Talking Zombie? No thanks,"This is coming from a true zombie-lover who watches all the films and reads all the books. This book was very promising, great intro, great set up, until about 10 or so pages in when they come face to face with a family member while looking for his son.Don't get me wrong, it's fiction, I know, but something about a zombie who not only talks, but reasons, and is well versed? Sorry, that's a no go. I closed this book and got my money back.I did not read the book ""The Rising"" so I don't know the set up or if the Zombies were so talkative in that one, but this does not pass go, does not collect two hundred dollars.It's too bad, it has potential.Boo Talking Zombies. Give me ""Wet Work"" any days over this, or anything by Max Brooks."
1,Could it get any worse?,"This is the sequel to The Rising, which was an okay zombie book. But this one is even worse. But maybe this is because I'm a fan of George Romero movies. If you like talking zombies that run, are intelligent, and just like normal humans except that they can only die by being shot in the head, then you might like this book. All the animals also become zombies in this book. The story isn't all that great either. Not recommended for true zombie fans."
1,Worst than The Raising!,After readin this two part series I could help but feel like Brian Keene had this written just so he could make a little bit of money. The first book was truly decent. This second one is like.....pulling you in and then loading the shotgun...and then putting it to your head.By the time you finish this book the only thing your going to remember is how much time you wasted.His horrible end leads me to believe he is a complete idiot who only seeks money. As I stated in The Raising review...Brian Keene is not the next Stephen King. He is the next Wes Craven. Someone who thinks they are scary when in all reality thei r plots are more chilling than their twisted writing.THE BOOK ENDS BAD! GO TAKE THE BOOK BACK. WARNING.you have been warned.
3,Too cartoonish for my taste,"I love Zombies. Ever since I watched George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, I was hooked.As I browsed through the bookstore, City Of The Dead caught my eye. The synopsis promised me a really good Zombie story.If the Zombies/demons were not so cartoonish, it would have been very good indeed.However, once I lost respect for the Zombies, it was downhill all the way."
2,Its a no-win situation for these survivors.,"I wouldn't reccamend this book. The author is too wrapped up in visceral, in your face evil and awful ways to die. There were several points in this book where I was wanting to put it down and forget about it but having paid cover price I soldiered on and finished it. The ending chase and last scene were horrific to say the least but I wasn't terribly moved.""City of the Dead"" is a mediocre story with excessive violence, some extreme sexual devience and too much emphasis on action. In short its not a book i'll look back on fondly.PS -The author Brian Keene does however make himself available to his fans on his own and other horror movie message boards so +1 to him for that."
3,Not a sequel in the way you're thinking..,"The City of the Dead was written because fans of The Rising who hated the ending wrote and emailed Brian Keene. This book had the feel that he was just slapping things together; the characters were a bit off, some of the situations were absurd, the tone was different, there was a donald trump clone, one major character was given a quick and unceremonious death, another character suddenly has mystical dreamsthat said, you do learn more about the demons and their purpose, and what happens next where they are concerned, and the ending has a sort of sad beauty all its ownso i give it 3.5 stars out of 5, because i did stay up reading it even though i grumbled the whole time"
3,"Good Read, Good Heroic Characters & a Big Crappy Ending","***spoiler alert***I immediately jumped into this book after finishing The Rising (since it essentially had a cliff-hanger for this sequel instead of an actual ending). It was again fast-paced, suspenseful and I was cringing and on the edge of my seat all at the same time. The characters were well-developed again and I was definitely rooting for my favorites. The evil zombies were again gory, disgusting entities that were demons in possession of soulless bodies. My problem with this book was the ending and the fact that the zombies could not be defeated. And the whole story line about the demons possessing plants and insects was just weird and stupid."
4,a good read,"good follow up. got a little crazy toward the end, but still a must read if you liked the first one."
3,The ending is bad again,"Listen, mr. Keene, please give us a book with a better ending. This book and the Rising are fun, fast, and scary, but the endings are weak. Get to know everyone and they all die anyway."
4,"Has it's faults, but still a fun read","My review of City of the Dead is pretty much identical to The Rising. It's a fun story that deviates away from the typical Zombie story. It's very graphic at times, and touches many disturbing topics such as castration, necrophelia, rape, homosexuality, etc.The zombies are intelligent, speak, drive, shoot guns, strategize, etc. Some people hate that, others don't. Same with the zombie animals, which are plentiful.My biggest problem with this book, much like The Rising, is the Zombie's dialogue is so mindnumbingly terrible. It's cheesy, corny, and unrealistic. Every zombie has the same personality, and it really stands out in an awful way.But still, like The Rising, I really enjoyed this book, and it was a fast read. I can totally understand why some people would hate it, but as for myself, it was money and time well spent."
4,La magie de CLAMP toujours au rendez-vous,"Ceux qui connaissent et aiment depuis plusieurs années l'univers fantaisiste-réaliste de CLAMP ne seront pas déus!L'adorable Chii (Tchi en version franaise) et son matre inexperimenté en tout, Hideki, forment une belle paire, et malgré leur situation quelque peu particulière, semblent consistuer des éléments de normalité dans un monde où l'on se marie avec son ordinateur personnel, où l'on sort en cachette avec son professeur mariée, mais où l'un garon qui achète une petite culotte féminine est l'image mme du beau pervers...Bref, des situations folles sur des thèmes sérieux, beaucoup d'humour, des dessins superbes (comme toujours avec CLAMP), et par-dessus tout des personnages auxquels on s'attache dès les premieres pages. Chobits a donc tout pour plaire à un public un tantinet plus gé que celui de Card Captor Sakura..."
3,not what I expected,"i got this movie and thot it was that other movie wit the zombees. so i was really confused but i guess it was ok i guess. there was no hot chicks in it tho, so that sux. i will probly watch it again tho cuz it wuz funny."
1,VERY poor quality,I have been searching for double length elastic wrap for my mother who has circulation issues. I saw the brand name used for this product and recognised it as the brand name that the hospital used. What came in the mail was VERY POOR quality. Useless. The first time we used it wrinkled horribly and cut off her sirculation. VERY painful after TWO hours of wear! HORRIBLE!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I doubt that this truely is a HARTMANN CONCO INC product.
5,Talking Heads at their peak,"Expanded reissue of a 1982 double length live recording. Disc One features radio appearances and live songs from 1977-1979. Disc Two's 14 tracks are one complete setlist compiled from 1980 shows in Tokyo, Cherry Hill (NJ) and Central Park (NYC). Outstanding supplement to their studio output and essential for any Talking Heads fan."
5,"""I hate people when they're not polite...""","The people have spoken. All well-deserved 4/5 star reviews. The biggest gripe seems to be over the abbreviated ""Cross Eyed"". Given the expanded package, it's a pretty minor gripe. This is not a remastered rip-off, nor some jive ""greatest hits live"". Absolutely essential for one and all: TH newbies and long-time fans needing to upgrade the cassette or vinyl. Never heard TH's minimalist stew of post-punk pop and Afro-funk? One listen to TNOTBITH, you'll be a fan."
4,Suit yourself,"Disc 1 documents why we cared in the beginning. Disc 2 documents a band (with judicious support) becoming transcendent. The total package makes the case for why the sum was greater than the current pieces parts. Adrian Belew has gone atmospheric and Bernie Worrell continues to define genius. The Talking Heads may be silenced, but this recording makes the case for greatness being found in the sum, which exceeds the current decapitated parts."
5,Definite classic,I love this figure for its nostalgic value. Those who were watching at the time of blueblood Hunter Hearst Helmsley should get a kick out of this one and it's something a bit different for the collection. Also it looks great in its packaging
3,"Overpriced, nothing that you don't know already.","Personally I think this book should cost way less, its only a few pages long and I believe that if you've ever been on a budget in your life the ideas offered are nothing that you didn't know already. On a brighter note its very easy to read."
1,Look for Teach Yourself Catalan,"In recent years, Routledge has gone from consistently producing excellent language courses to producing some excellent courses and some bad courses. Unfortunately, Colloquial Catalan is a prime example of the very worst Colloquial courses.The main error in this course is the fact that it's exceptionally limited. After completing some of the more extensive Colloquial courses, you will master the grammar of the language and have a solid basic vocabulary. Colloquial courses like Colloquial Italian, Colloquial Czech, Colloquial Albanian or Colloquial Icelandic list over 2000 words. The average Colloquial courses list 1000-1500 words. In sharp contrast, Colloquial Catalan doesn't even reach 600 words!In my opinion, the Colloquial courses are often a better option than Teach Yourself courses, but that's not the case with Catalan. Teach Yourself Catalan will teach you more than twice as much as Colloquial Catalan."
3,Still lost,"I envisioned an accompanying written guide, but nope! The short lessons on cd are convenient, but if you aren't the best auditory learner (like myself), look for some written material to supplement."
2,Incomplete,"Although a cd teaching Catalan is great, it really needs to have the guide in order to use it properly. This is not clear in the description."
5,THE GODFATHER OF ROCK N ROLL!,"The ""Chess Box"" is a Chuck Berry treasure chest not to be missed. Elvis may have been king, but Chuck invented Rock N Roll along with Little Richard. His influence on major rock acts is legendary, just ask the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Leon Russell, Eric Clapton, Simon and Garfunkel and Bob Dylan how important he is to modern day rock? All the goods are here to enjoy in 3 cd's taking the listener through a career retrospective second to none. ""Maybelline"" ""Sweet Little Sixteen"", ""To Much Monkey Business"" and ""Johnny B Goode"" are only the tip of the iceberg here. This is quite possibly the most important boxed set ever released. Only Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard could match his intensity during the 1950's rock n roll boom. This should be required listening for all those rock n roller 101's out there. Chuck Berry's Chess Box gives the listener a fantastic history lesson on rock n blues by the rock ICON himself professor Chuck Berry."
4,look past the standards for lesser-known gold.....,"As all reviewers will attest, this is the hi-octane ""real McCoy,"" a body of work of which dreams are made. Chuck's famous standards are all here, but delve deeper for lesser-known sides. Of particular interest are ""Tulane"" and ""Have Mercy Judge,"" the latter being the conclusion of the story. A two-part tale of star-crossed lovers busted for selling drugs. While that might not seem like the hot ticket for a evocative story-song, it is. ""Tulane"" is a frenetic rocker while ""Have Mercy Judge is pure blues. Play them back to back to witness rock genius at work."
5,This man invented Rock and Roll,"In my opinion, Chuck Berry is the father of all things rock and roll. With a little help from the Muddy Waters spawned Chicago Blues genre, rock and roll as we know it (or knew it) was formed. This box contains almost everything anyone could ever want from ole' Chuck. There is some history contained on this set."
4,THE SPIRITUAL FATHER OF ROCK,"Youngsters will complain:i prefer the BEATLES or The ROLLING STONES versions and even the BEACH BOYS who aped him with SURFIN USA will always have the edge over the originals.Still a rock collection is not complete with at least the first two cds of this box.Those two cds are the heart and soul of a music we used to call rock.So many artists have been influenced by CHUCK BERRY,the list is endless from DYLAN to SPRINGSTEEN;he was the best lyric writer of the fifties.In fact,he made us aware that rock songs had lyrics to go alongside the guitar riffs.With that box,you get the original feeling of these songs as they were sung before the BRITISH INVASION sharpened them for their own good.(...)"
3,It sounds horrible,The songs are great and are really classics that you must own. However this box set has really an unacceptable sound quality. Hopefully this will be remastered sometime soon since the sound quality does murder these standards. Basicalyl you would have everything you need here by cHuck Berry if it sounded slightly better. Avoid!
4,Definitive...almost!,"Some previous reviewers have said that this box includes every great Berry song...they're wrong. It would be perfect if it weren't for the inexplicable omissions of ""Don't You Lie To Me"" and ""I Got To Find My Baby"". There would also have been room for ""Route 66""...I must say that 'Anthology' does an excellent job in boiling this 3 CD set down to 2, AND it contains ""Don't You Lie To Me"" as well as ""I Got To Find My Baby""!"
2,Is a Concert DVD Impossible?,Wouldn't it be nice to put on a McCartney dvd and actually watch a concert? The substantial number of Mac's dvd releases are the same... song performances that often interrupt the talking heads. Interviews in 5.1 are really neat though.
3,Pleeease Paul just make a straigt concert video!!!!,"Paul is great, Paul is good but Paul needs to stop making these kinds of concert video's where there is more audience, blabbing, interruptions than PAUL for g's sake. There are music message boards all over the place after the release of this that are screaming at the ADD affect of this video. He is the greatest living song writer of our time. SO, we want a straight concert video of him singing, etc. Pleeease Paul, put all of the other junk that you feel needs to complete you as a performer on a second video! Everyone will be happy then. And fans can sit back and have an uninterrupted Concert from Paul McCartney sans the other not really,who give a__, people on the planet!!! We don't need anyone to tell us you are FAB. YOU ARE buddie so believe it and hire another director and creative team to give your fans the real deal! MUSIC!!!!"
4,Great - But...........,"Great songlist but there are too many audience shots and mini interviews.If you are expecting Hey Jude and Let it Be you are in for a dissapointment. (Mini Interviews with very small parts of the songs) The rest of the songs more than make up for this issue. If there were two versions, one with the uncut concert and one as it is, it would be perfect."
3,there is much more space with in us than this dvd shows,"I'd like to start this review by saying that I like this dvd very much! However, after seeing Paul live in San Jose Ca this dvd doesn't come close to showing what it was really like. Paul played 37 songs in a about 2 and 3 quarter set. Songs like ""Jet"" ""Hey Jude"" ""Let It Be"" and especially ""Inspite of All the Danger"" were ommitted. These are the ones I can remember off the top of my head, there were alot more. What we got on this dvd is terific! I enjoyed the special features particulerly the sound checks from San Jose. So iI guess what I'm trying to say is that I really liked ""The Space With In Us"" I just wish there had been more consert footage and less talking between songs. That's why I'm only giving this dvd three stars."
2,More of PAUL please!,"I was privileged to attand one of the concerts on that tour. Having a not so good seat (though I was thrilled just to be there) I was so hoping that I would be able to see more of him on the video. I was extremely disappointed in that there was less of Paul and more of the concert goers, backstage scenes, interviews with people I really didn't care to listen to (ESPECIALLY 3 of Bill Clinton). Except for the fact I did get to see him sing a few songs, it was not worth the cost."
4,grande show,a simples presena de sir paul mc cartney dispensa comentários um agrande show com músicas inesqueciveis blu-ray chegou em perfeito estado
5,Amazing!!!,"As a Macca fan, I've bought all his music on vynil records, cd, vhs and dvd, and it'been great!!!!But now, with the appearance of blu ray, it is more than that!! Perfection has been reached.It is really amazing to enjoy image and sound!!!! I hope "" The space within us"" is just the begining.I hope to find more Macca stuff in BD, very soon!!!!"
5,Almost perfect!,One of the greatest shows i've ever seen!The only trouble is the speechs between the songs.
1,one star and I've not even seen it,"I will wait until I PERSONALLY hear from someone who's seen this DVD before I lay down dollars to purchase it. Why? Because I'm sick and tired of Paul McCartney videos where half the footage is of the audience wiping tears from their eyes and fawning all over the guy. John Lennon would have NEVER done that kind of thing. Paul, your music is fantastic and I have all your released audio stuff. However, until you get your DVD act together, I'll stick with the CDs. Sorry pal!"
2,Great song selection - The execution is the problem...,"McCartney rummages through his old songs and manages to come up with an appealing set-list: ""For No One"", ""I Will"", ""Too Many People"", ""I've Got A Feeling"", ""Please Please Me"" and many other that have not received a proper live treatment.The problem is one that McCartney has been struggling with form many years, his voice is simply trashed for most of the performance. Rather than hitting the high notes he ends up yelling / screaming in time with the music.There are a few complete bummers too. ""Flaming Pie"" has always been a nothing wink-wink nonsense song written to cash in on a famous Lennon expression. New tracks like ""English Tea"", which is funnier than Spinal Tap's ""Cups and Cakes"", and ""Jenny Wren"" make you wonder when he stopped trying to write interesting music.If you're a huge McCartney fan, it might be worth a rental at the video store, but there's nothing here worth watching more than one."
3,A so so DVD,"Maybe I expected too much from this, as I had a great memory of this concert, maybe I was influenced by the bad reviews I read for this before I got it, but I was kind of dissapointed by this.The songs are great, but theres something missing for me, I feel its kind of slow. Back in the US was an action movie compared to this, Abe looks like hes sedated contrary to what we saw last time when he nearly destroyed his drum kit.But hey, its Paul McCartney!"
2,A concert DVD without a real concert!,"I feel like I bought the ""Back in the US""DVD all over again!! I should have played it safe and borrowed or rented this one!This was more documentary than anything else. Don't waste your time or money with this one!!"
2,What?? Why doesn't Dolby 5.1 work???,"Pop this baby in the 'ol BluRay player and... What the heck?? Why does the audio sound soo dull? I'm talkin' extremely weak, flat, and NOT Dolby 5.1. Sure, you can select 5.1 audio in the setup menu, but the reality is you'll only hear stereo. And very dull, lifeless stereo at that. Somebody should lose their job over this oversight."
3,Same Old Rockumentary,"This is just another repeat of all the other live DVDS paul keeps putting out. I dont really want to see some dork in the audience dancing to pauls songs. I saw Paul in concert 4 times 89,93,2002 2005.He is truly the most awesome performer out there. This DVD dosent show that.I know Pauls fans mean alot to him, but I dont need or want to see them.I wish Paul would read these comments and put out a true concert DVD. A wordof advise, go to Ebay and get the bootleg of Paul min Madrid Spain. Itsall Paul and band Rockin out with no stupid audience shots. Also get Rockshowfrom Wings in 76."
5,It's your monies worth....,"My family and I saw this tour in San Jose, Ca, and it was, and still is, a magical evening in our lives. On the way into the pavillion Paul rolled down his window, popped out, and gave a peace sign. For brief moment in time we made eye contact with this most famous and recognizable person and it was a perfect lift off for the rest of the evening. I agree with others regarding this DVD issue, it would be nice to have just concert footage here but you know, after playing these concert films a few times you tend to scene jump anyway, so it really doesn't make a difference. You can watch your favorte song over and over...Jenny Wren! McCartney delivers, price of the DVD is reasonable, less than a concert ticket, front row, too."
3,"SPACE WITHIN US: GOOD IMAGE BUT A BAD, BAD SOUND...","After buying another time this title on Blu-ray, I was disappointed with the sound! Excellent Blu-ray image but the sound leaves much to be desired. Surprisingly, the version of this show on DVD had DTS sound technology impeccable ... Why the more modern version in Blu-ray does not offer the same quality of sound? It is unfortunate! I feel I succeeded!That's all for a while.Carlos EmmerichSo Paulo, Brazil."
2,some scenes pathetic,"Don't get me wrong, the music is superb, watching him play ""follow me"" is perfect, but I don't understand why they had to waste 15 min. in a lame family going to the concert, taping all the steps, from the preparing to meeting Paul, I just couldn't watch that clip.The audience, oh my god, how many takes do I have to watch to realise that people love him.I would really like to watch a steady cam on a tripod aiming only to the band, that's all I'm asking, no extras, no interviews, only an entire concert without cuts.I went to The Joint Las Vegas to see him and most of the people are not like the ones on the dvd, they enjoy, how many time did the camera man had to waste to tape that kind of audience, just not enjoyable.About the music, superb."
1,The ME Tour,"Paul calls this the ""us"" tour at one point on the DVD. Rather it should be called the ""ME"" tour. Basically this is a collection of fan reaction shots interpersed with sound bites from personalities who are supposed to impress on us the importance of Paul to modern civilization. Oh yes, there are a few shots of Paul playing, but I don't remember any close ups and the camera never stays on him for even a full sentence during a song. Apparently, it is too important to show more fans in ecstasy, on ecstasy, or whatever, for us to actually watch Paul performing.Okay, Paul, we get it. We are supposed to like you. Maybe we could like you more if you didn't keep reminding us and just let us watch?"
5,No Space for doubt !,"Holy Smokes!I've been a great Beatles fan since 1968,I well still remember, I was in 9th grade, already with my officail girlfrien,well,that's what I thought. I have bouth collections; The Beatles LP's and now the CD's and DVD's. I was myself part of this great DVD, with my son and my ex-wife. Madison Square Garden - Unforgettable. We were enjoying the Beatles live one more time. The back stage computerized scenes were hot. ""The Space Within Us"" The Best investment for Beatles fans, an Eternal Memory."
5,"More of a documentary, than a concert movie.","This DVD was taken pretty much in the same vein as the previous release of the Moscow/St Pete DVD.Many little side trips during the concert. Tended to stop the nice flow the concert was creating.I gave it 5 stars because for one thing, I got it at a very low price. You can't deny listening toMacca do the old Fab 4 tunes without a smile on your face...and maybe a few tears. The rendition ofPlease Please Me during the encore was a special moment. Macca taking the lead on a song that was normallysang by John Lennon. The fan reaction during the encore was quite emotional to watch."
5,Not Looking Forward Anymore,However if the documentary footage interrupts the concert footage and we see only a portion of the songs..then I am not interested.Addendum 11/14: After reading the reviews of people who have seen it...I am sorry I bought it. In fact I am rather angry with McCartney that he doesn't have the good sense or controlled ego to let the music speak for itself and not have all the celebs state how wonderful he is.
3,Missing Song?,"Anyone notice that ""She Came In Through the Bathroom Window"" was included on the broadcast version on A&E? This song is not on the dvd! The dvd is supposed to include more footage not less! What a shame..."
1,STAY FAR AWAY!!,Paul... is so crafty and controlling! and dosen't even know how to make a real live dvd... still needs to take lessons from THE EAGLES!! Stay away from this disaster!!
3,"Paul As Entertainer, Not Artist","Another echo of the many, many complaints here. The band is utterly fantastic, Paul is genuinely relaxed onstage (watching how he takes the guitar lead on the ""Foxey Lady"" riff early on is SO refreshing), and the tunes are out of this world. He's working with the greatest band he has assembled in the post-Beatles era, he's coming off a string of superlative albums...and he puts out yet another dvd chock full of soul-crushingly sycophantic messiah-worship that is every bit as ham-fisted as his best work is nuanced. I agree that it is a deep-seated insecurity, and not an excess of arrogance (as it was with John Lennon), that drives him to put out this infomercial-eque drivel. There is a huge minority of McCartney fans out there that despises the hollow theatrics and redundant myth-making, and it's a shame to think that he still feels called upon to constantly succumb to shark-eyed mass adulation."
3,It could have been better,"I went to the 2005 US Tour and the 2002 Driving Tour. Super...Super tour.It seems that every new dvd of a concert you see more people than the band. Fans really want to see the band playing, and of course all the songs, that's what everybody was hoping for. It's ok to show a bit of the audience, but not that much. In ""HEY JUDE"", it only showed a bit of the end. ""LET IT BE"" was the same. These songs were in the songs list of the dvd but it wasn't, ""really"". I know that hundreds of thousands of people around the world ""AGREE"" that IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. If the dvd would have all complete songs, it would have been 5 Stars....A GREAT MEMORABILIA for those who went to the concert. What happened to LIVE AND LET DIE?, IN SPITE OF ALL THE DANGER?, JET?, BAND ON THE RUN?, SGT. PEPPER/THE END? Hope,next dvd tour will be better."
4,"The new ""old"" songs are there..........","I realize that there are a lot of audience shots in the concert footage along with the interviews between songs. This doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would.What I really wanted, I got. The performances of all of the songs that he hasn't played since he was with the Beatles, (Til There Was You, I'll Get You, For No One, I'll Follow the Sun, Please Please Me, She Came in Through the Bathroom Window). I'll Follow the Sun and Please Please Me are what I consider the highlights of the show.There are now not many songs left from the Beatles catalogue that he has not performed live since he began touring in 1990. And I'm referring to the songs that he wrote.If he tours again, I'd like to hear (The Night Before, She's A Woman, Another Girl, I Don't Want To Spoil The Party, Lovely Rita)."
2,"Here we go again- ""The focus on the fan...""","Yet another of McCartney's endless ego trips, with the false modesty that it's all about ""US"", the fans. Sure the music sounds great and he plays many songs we haven't seen live before. But the concert is directed with the same painfully annoying cutaways of the audience as his last two concert films. This time we get to see more fawning celebrities paying homage to Sir Paul and gee whiz, folks- interviews with real everyday folks crying and letting us know that Paul loves them. I love the unintentional laugh and irony of the ""fan"" saying that underneath Paul is really a humble, everyday guy, you just have to look really hard! Will McCartney's depthless insecurity ever be satisfied?So far, Paul has dismantled the Soviet Union- and with this one, he claims to be saving family relationships through his music. I feel good in a special way!Oh, where is John Lennon when you need him most?"
2,A&E- LET IT BE!,"I saw Paul during this tour - I was so excited when this DVD came out, and was really let down.I wanted to see a Paul McCartney DVD, not a bunch of people talking about how timeless Paul is. I'M A BEATLES FAN - I KNOW THAT ALREADY!The lowlight of the film is when A&E; decides to cut away from 'Let it Be,' the post beautiful performance of the show I was at, and show Bill Clinton talking about Paul. WHO CARES?"
4,Make The Next One A Concert DVD.,"EVERY McCartney concert video has the same format(fast paced montage of four seconds shots,dozens of zoom in-out and around and audience shots of moslty well endowed pretties, and ecstatic people, commentaries who makes you feel like you're witnessing the second coming).The music is great,the band is youthfull and energetic and the performances are often inspired,so please give us a well produced concert like so many other rock performers put out(Concert for George,Gilmour,Clapton,Chili Peppers,etc...).O.K, the bi-polar in me still loves this concert because of the great songlist,the very much rockier arrangements ,guitar heavy sound and fantastic drummer. This younger band has given Paul a major energy boost compared to his previous touring band with Robbie McIntosh and Hamish Stewart.So,it sure ain't going to please everyone,but i watched it three times already. It has to mean something no??"
1,Too much focus on the audience,"Paul and his band give a great a performance but i couldn't make it through the whole video and would definitely not recommend it. For some reason the director decided to spend more time shooting the audience than the band. It is annoying to say the least. I didn't buy this video to see the middle aged audience members smiling and dancing around, I bought this concert dvd thinking I was going to see the show. The director failed miserably and should be flogged in my opinion."
1,More Macca--Way Less Audience,"I have watched this DVD once and will never watch it again. It follows the same format as all of Paul's concert DVDs--way too many audience shots, especially the blonde young chicks. How did they get there anyway? I want to see Paul McCartney. Paul isn't going to tour forever, so please put out one decent tour DVD in your career. This one is going to a friend. I can't stand the pain of watching it. It took me days to watch it. That is how bad it is and I'm a big time fan."
4,The Next best thing to seeing him in person,"I have to admit Paul has never been my favorite Beatle. Paul however is the last of the Beatles who wrote music.I do enjoy many songs Paul has written with the Beatles, with Wings and as a solo performer.What you have here is history. Paul McCartney and John Lennon are the two greatest composers/writers of the last century.This is a chance to see one of the Masters displaying why he is so popular and fameous.Paul opens the show with Hello, Goodbye and it just goes uphill from there.Another thing that was cool was how he ended a song with Foxy Lady, the old Jimi Hendrix tune.He does Beatles classics like Got to get you into my life and Penny Lane, among others.To me the hightlight of the show was when he did Jenny Wren and English Tea for the current album.He also closes the show with Yesterday and other big hits from the Beatles days.This is not as good as seeing him in person, but it is the next best thing."
4,Back and Forth Camera Action Makes Me Dizzy,"Great performances! Paul and the band are kicking it, alright! They couldn't be any better. Too much back and forth camera work from stage to audience and back makes it hard for me to watch, however. Keep it on the stage more, next time. Paul is nice to look at and so are the others in the band! I'm glad I got it, though. The music makes it all worthwhile."
1,very disapointed Paul Mc Cartney Dvd,"I have been ordering items from Amazon for a long time and this is the first time I have been very upset with the item I orderd. The Paul Mccartney Dvd in blue ray was a gift for my husband for Christmas. He was very excited to watch it. When we all sat down on Christmas night and started the Dvd, it skipped and froze for the first 3 minutes. No matter how may times we started it over and cleaned it and tried it never would play the right way. I called amazon and they sent me a replacement dvd which was also very bad. After the 2nd one I just wanted my money back. DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM and if you do then prepare to be disapointed. I Think the whole batch that was copied was bad."
5,Why Paul is the real King..........,"I was lucky to see Paul 3 times on the 2005 US tour - Anaheim, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles...........you'll see on this concert film why he's the real King of Rock and Roll. Gems like ""I'll Get You"", ""I'll follow the sun"", ""Mystery Tour"", classics like Maybe I'm Amazed"", Good Day Sunshine, Hey Jude, new ones like Jenny Wren, rareties like Flaming Pie.! The list is incredible, the emotions are sky high. Bass, Piano, Guitar, Acoustic, Voice.......all fantastic -Rusty, Abe, Wix, Brian are probably his best and energetic band ever - the lights and video are the best you can get. His talent is the proof, do not forget the King - from the greatest team of all - The Beatles."
3,"Complete, but not all is good","First of all, Buddy didnt became a legend for these recordings. They didnt sold either. Only on a few of these tracks you'll hear the guitar genious that he is. He became what he is for his live performances, on which he could get loose and play what he wanted. The recordings are good and historical, but not good enough for a 2 CD set which is too expensive by the way. Go get the very best of buddy guy, which contains some live tracks and some tracks of the 70's that do showcase his guitar abilities at his best. This cd is only for completists: it contains leave my girl alone, and going to school (which is mary had a little lamb), which is a better version than the one on a man and the blues album."
3,A little too complete,"Even the liner notes say it, "" Buddy Guy was always the proverbial odd man out during the Chess Years. "" These recordings taken from when Guy was basically a top side man for Chess show an artist who was trying to find his place at a company that didn't know what to do with him. Wacky dance songs like ""Slop Around"" and novelties like ""I Dig Your Wig,"" are mixed with great tunes like ""My Mother,"" and ""I Suffer the Blues."" This one is really for the Buddy Guy fan who wants everything he has recorded."
5,BUDDY GUY THE GREATEST ANTHOLOGY,"You've got a fabulous anthology of one of the greatest blues man : BUDDY GUY. It dates from 1963 to 1967 and released on Chess label. The sound is great and all the songs are fabulous. You can find the cream of the bluesmen that backed BUDDY (FRED BELOW on Drums, SONNY BOY WILLIAMSON & JUNIOR WELLS Harmonicas,LAFAYETTE LEAKE & OTIS SPANN Pianos, JACK MEYERS Bass, BOB NEELY Tenor Sax....). Listen great songs as ""Slop Around"" ""I Dig Your Wig"" or ""Watch Yourself"", fantastic stuff !!!! A great soulful blues outfit. Buy it, you can trust me.Fred."
3,mariasreview,i use the bandage every day on my left foot to keep swelling down...i purchase 4 of them and hand wash as needed...i found it lost elasticity after only 1 hand wash but still usable to keep sweeling down
2,Where is the Ghiardelli Chocolate Taste?,"Having liked the various types of Ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoa's I decided to try some Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Chocolate Mocha. After trying several cups of this I started to wonder what happened to the Ghirardelli Chocolate as myself I thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste. Not my cup of hot cocoa!!"
5,Ghirardelli Has Done it Again,"I made this for my 12 year old grandson. ""Grandma this is the best hot chocolate I have ever had in my whole life!"" You can guess what he got for Christmas. It really has a wonderful flavor. Top it off with whipped cream."
2,"Weird texture, too rich","The instructions on this product HAVE to be wrong. 4 tbsp to 8 oz of milk? Also, mixing it with milk as recommended makes it WAY too rich. It also has an odd texture, it's not very smooth or creamy. It's really like the powder doesn't fully dissolve in the milk. Also, I think heating milk in the microwave and adding it to anything always tastes bad. Better on the stove, but who has time for that in the morning. Anyway, totally not worth the price. A pack of instant swiss miss is way better than this. Too bad swiss miss stopped making pick me up! That was the best way to get hot chocolate with some caffeine!"
2,Not my cup of Cocoa,"Very bitter! I couldn't taste the coffee at all. It basically tastes like baking cocoa. No sweetness, no richness, not coffee. I bought the 4 pack though, so I've begun mixing it half and half with Swiss Miss (in the can), and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after I've made a cup. Even making it with whole milk couldn't make this yummy by itself. If you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee.... shop elsewhere."
3,"Tastes Good, But it's a lot of one flavor","The Chocolate Mocha flavor of this Hot Cocoa is really nice. It's different from the usual Hot Cocoa since it has a hint of Coffee. The quality is definitely there, I find it to be better then the Godiva brand. Mixes extremely easily, there is no residue and works with milk or even water mixed with half and half. I must say that it is a bit much of the same flavor, I would have rather 4 different flavors since the containers are big. Worth it though! A++"
2,Not as rich and satisfying as I thought,"Not really sure what I expected, but since I like Ghirardelli chocolate, and I like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops, I thought I'd like this product.Unfortunately, despite following the directions and making this in milk, it's not as rich and satifying as I hoped. I hate to say it, but I think Swiss Miss mixed Instant coffee tastes better than this.That's unfortunate, because this is a four pack of cannisters and I'm only half way through the first one!"
5,Ghirardelli chocolate mocha hot cocoa-16 oz. can,"If you've never tried any of Ghirardelli's hot cocoa products you are in for a treat! Made with milk, the cocoa is far superior to any other cocoa product on the market. I don't drink coffee, but have a cup of this every morning. When made in the Froth Au Lait hot chocolate/latte maker, you will get the best cup of hot cocoa you ever had."
3,Coffee not my favorite,"I accidentally got this not realizing it had coffee in it, but if you like or love coffee, it will taste pretty good"
3,Hot chocolate is great - Packaging wasn't so good.,The hot chocolate is great but the fact that five canisters were busted is disappointing. These were being used as customer gifts so I had to go to a local grocery store and pay more for product I should already have.
5,Christmas is Around the Corner,"When I was in Jr Hi our next door neighbor on hearing I was allergic to Eggs, made me a chocolate fruit cake for my Birthday, with the prime ingredient being Ghirardelli Cocoa Mix, that she bought in the City at Ghirardelli Square. Its been a favorite of mine for the last 50+ years. You can try other brands, but only Ghirardelli allows it to be made right."
5,Classic collection,"Chicago bluesman Mighty Joe Young's discography is a mixed bag, some of his CD's are very good while others are inconsistent and uneven. This CD features songs from two long out of print albums he recorded in the 70s that were probably his best albums. Featuring mostly original material and good, contemporary production, these recordings showcase Mighty Joe at his best, doing his own brand of blues with a whole lot of soul thrown in. Try listening to ""Chickenheads"" without nodding your head, you won't be able to. For those who like deep blues, check out his cover the classic ""As the Years Go Passing By"", probably the bluesiest song on the CD.Those who like traditional, straight ahead blues (Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf etc.) will want to pass on this collection, but those who like more soul flavored Chicago blues (Buster Benton, Jimmy Johnson) will definitely want this fine CD."
5,Life inside the world of learning disabilities.,"This book ""hooked"" me at chapter one when the author recounts her story about how she got into the field. After you read the first chapter, you get the impression that once you enter the world of LD, you have entered the region of the damned, regardless of whether or not you are a student w/the diagnosis, a parent, or a teacher. LD carries a ""stigma"" that is akin to having the mark-of-the-beast, in some circles. Students are treated like second class citizens, or as if they were going to school in a third world dictatorship, parents are dissed and disregarded, the teachers never get the materials, respect from admin. or peers, and the administrative support they need to make sure these dear children have a decent shot at success.The Pretenders will open your eyes into this little understood world. At times, it may even make you cry as you reflect upon the pain that students and parents (and adults w/LD) have to endure on a daily basis."
5,Encouraging series of vignettes for those with ADD and LD.,"This excellent book is a must for those with family members suffering from ADD and LD problems. Such readers will recognize a thread in common with the adult ""pretenders"" whose stories the author artfully presents. Each vignette recounts a heroic struggle to succeed against imposing odds. A good read!"
3,más o menos,"No me mires tan extraño (un retrato habanero como ninguno, aunque al final repite demasiado el estribillo), Se puede ser , El ilustrado Caballero de París (aunque tiene una parte que dice ""Y escribía Viva Fidel en recortes de las servilletas, y lo hacía con amor"", algo horroroso que me parece un perrerismo de Gerardo, pero el resto de la canción es muy bonito) y La balada de John sentado y no crucificado, me parecen las mejores canciones de este disco. Personalmente creo que él tiene genialidades, pero muchas veces explota un a voz que no posee, y llega a ser pedante. La elección es tuya. Por cuatro canciones..."
2,A lot of room for improvement,"After spending sometime reading this book, I find that this book still has a lot of room for improvement. This book does not have any proof on all the results that it states. It lacks all the required basic concepts and skips some important topics (IMHO). Nevertheless, it shows a lot of state of the art circuits and applications. This book is great as a reference book if you consider yourself an expert on ADC. There are a lot of mathematics without any detail proof. For a hundred dollar, I am expecting the author to do some work rather than trying to make some quick money. I am returning my copy."
1,garbage,"DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!recycled tracks, boring production, a lack of lyrical originality or thought for the project. worst album of 2002..."
1,If only the coverart were relevant...because that looks neat,"The most interesting thing about this book is the cover art, which shows some sort of weird robot thing with arms coming out of its hips... and yet... there are no robots of any kind in the actual book. It almost makes me wonder if this is the cover art intended for some other book. The other book was probably better, too.Planet of the Damned was a short book, which is one of the few nice things I can say about it. I am usually quite easy to please but this book's plot was pointless, the characters were pointless... I never felt any sense of urgency for their situation or even cared if they lived or died."
3,"""Damned"" waste of time","Another of those stories wherein only a specially trained superman can save the day. In this case, a man from a frozen world is the only one who can acclimatize to a hot planet (yeah, right). Ends rather abruptly with too contrived a solution to the problem. Occasionally goes off-topic to rant against religion, totally meaningless to the story.The middle portion of the book drones on endlessly while saying nothing, it was like reading a politician talk about his trip to the beach.Had it's moments so I gave it 3 stars."
1,"This is not a review, this is a warning","There are 2 interesting things in this book:1. The cover, shamelessly ripped off by the Simmons' Hyperion artist.2. The premise of a planet civilization based around games, something worked out flawlessly in Banks' Player of Games.However, the cover will only take you as far as page 1 and the games at around page 20. Because, then Harrison does a ""Deathworld"", unfortunately by orders of magnitude less interesting than the original Deathworld (which was not ground breaking SF to start with). End of warning and zero stars."
2,Trouble switching USB,"I liked the price and compact form factor of this KVM, and it switched the video well and quickly, but it was always slow and temperamental when switching the USB. Sometimes, I had to toggle it a couple times before the USB would properly connect and the light quit flashing. But this degraded to where it would cause the laptop to get into very wierd modes, with erratic mouse behavior. This required switching to a different USB port, and increasingly so, even rebooting the laptop. So I finally scrapped it and replaced it with this 4 port versionIogear GCS634U MiniView 4-Port USB KVM Switch. Though more expensive, it's working much better so far."
4,Does what its supposed to do.,"Yup, as the title says, it does what it (says and what it's) supposed to do...only thing, there is a slight (but bearable) delay when the switch is made, in that period (while the indicator LED is flashing) the mouse and keyboard dont work as they normally would.Good KVM for my money."
2,Worked fine for a while,"This KVM switch worked adequately for a while. One laptop and one desktop each running XP Pro. About every 20 times I booted a machine it would ""loose"" the mouse. Resetting was difficult. After 9 months of use, one channel no longer transmitted the blue signal to the display (red and green were fine). The failure was in the device, not the cables. Pay a few bucks more and buy a different brand."
1,"Horribly slow, works sometimes","This switch takes about 10 seconds to switch from one computer to the next, this is unacceptably slow. Other KVM switches have no trouble switching in <1sec, so if you're used to switching back and forth a lot, avoid this product.The hotkey feature only works part time between Windows XP boxes, sometimes you have to hit the key (double-scrl-lock) multiple times, which gets really annoying after several missed switches.Also, the hotkey switch only works one-way between a Linux and a Windows box (can't switch back to Windows, you have to use the button on the KVM switch), so this is a non-starter.The switch doesn't allow you to program a different hotkey, it's all burnt-in, take it or leave it.This junk goes right back to Amazon as we speak. Avoid this product, get something decent for a few dollars more if you use it on a regular basis!"
3,i bought it for the wrong thing but it works perfect!,whoops it thought this product was to be used to switch between two monitors not use them at the same time but if you are here to use two monitors at the same time then you got your moneys worth now i have to figure what will i do now?
1,Worked for 1.5 hours --- piece of junk,"Installed. Both computers working fine, was able to switch between each. Then received error 'Unknown USB device' (after less than 2 hours). Keyboard and mouse on both machines dead. Put back 'old' keyboard/mouse to shutdown. Removed 'old'-- reboot --- device NEVER worked again."
1,Not even worth the cheap price,"This is my first review on Amazon and probably will be my only one. I've used Amazon for years and have never reviewed products before as I am usually satisfied with the products I purchase. However, this KVM switch has got to be one of the worst products I have ever come across. I've used this product for about 3 months and it barely is usable as a KVM switch. Where to start? For starters, the USB connection cuts in and out frequently, the actual switching takes a few minutes on some occasions and every now and again I am force to do a hard shutdown as the KVM fails to respond (even Windows will complain the USB connection has failed). I'll stop here to keep the review short. Avoid this product, spend a few bucks more on a decent KVM switch. This is a cheapo product by a company looking to make a quick buck."
3,"Good, until...","This switch worked just fine until my house was hit by lighting, killing the USB functionality. I still can use the switch to manualy select display inputs to my monitor.When the switch first arrived, it was easy to install, and worked as expected. The next time I buy a KVM switch, I would include sound switching as well."
2,Horrible with VMware,"I am a systems Administrator who switches between VM hosts and clients a thousand times a day. Each time I move my mouse into a VM system, the KVM kicks me out. It's not an easy fix for me since I do this all day long. I'm going to try the IO switch that someone else had luck with."
2,dedicated keyboard buttont don't work,"i have the tk-423k and the basic keyboard & mouse function ok but many dedicated buttons on the keyboard are rendered useless. volume up/down, calculator, mute and many others on my ms comfort 5000 keybd/mouse combo don't work. caps lock use to pop up when they were on. this no longer works either. i'm sure i'll find more as i use it and probably end up throwing it out. bummer!"
1,Junk,"I bought this to use between a PC laptop and an Intel Mac. In order for it to work properly, you need to boot up with the USB attached to the KVM. If you plug it in afterwards, it will not work. Even then, after you switch inputs the USB on the other sometimes stops working."
2,A frustrating problem with this switch.,"I rolled the dice when I bought this cheaper KVM switch. I wish now that I would have purchased a more expensive one.The unit seems to be designed ok, the cables are long enough and hook up was pretty simple. The owners manual and documentation are pretty good and the Trendnet website is somewhat helpful if needed.The problem that I've had with this unit is that it will switch without cause. I'll be working on one computer, with the other one shut off, and all of the sudden the KVM starts switching back and forth between the two computers. Sometimes it won't stop and won't settle on a computer at all, it just keeps flashing back and forth.I didn't install the Trendnet supplied software because the manual that came with the KVM said that the switch would operate fine without it and that the software was for ""advanced features"".I would not recommend this KVM switch. I would recommend spending a little more money on a switch with better ratings."
2,Be aware of its big hidden limitation,"For me, the problem with this specific model of USB KVM switch as opposed to my old switch that used PS2 connectors is that it won't keep the USB connection alive when you switch away from either of the PCs.Since it dismounts the USB devices (keyboard and mouse) every time you switch away and then remounts the devices when you switch back, there is a good chance the devices will lock up. The instances of this happening occur more and more frequently as time goes by, and each time it happens the mouse and keyboard freeze up leaving me no choice but to reboot the machine.It's cheap for a reason. Skip this model and look for a switch that will always keep the USB connections alive on both machines no matter which PC you're using."
1,Dead,"Dead out of the box. Did not matter how I hooked up the monitor and/or keyboard, and trying other monitor and other keyboard, nothing switched. Very poor."
2,"Like most TRENDnet products, it's borderline junk","I've gone to this brand a number of times based on their features and price point. And I've been disappointed nearly every time. This unit makes no exceptions. Switching between computers is marginal sometimes requiring rebooting the power on the unit or, unplugging and replugging. I've tried it with PC and Mac and it's even worse with the Mac. Better units fake that the device is still connected when you switch computers so your computer doesn't think it's gone. Also, the buttons to switch computers get flaky after limited use. Save up your money and buy a higher quality unit."
2,Avoid this for Computer Shops,"I purchased this KVM switch for a second KVM based on newer computers that do not have PS2 slots on them. I have a QVS KVM switch that is PS2 based and it has worked fine for years.However I have found this one to be seriously lacking in the field of computer repair, as I am constantly swapping computers out on my bench. I am sure this one would work fine on computers that will be hooked up to it for a mesure of time. But for test bench uses it never works on the keyboard and mouse. I have to always hook a seperate keyboard and mouse up to the computer to get windows to load, then once it loads, it detects the KVM's Keyboard and Mouse, and I can use it just fine. I blame this short coming on the fact it only has one USB cord that hooks up to the computer."
2,Does not work with docking stations,"I purchased this to switch monitor, keyboard and mouse between a desktop and a laptop with a docking station. It did not recognize the mouse and keyboard when hooked to docking station and worked only when connected directly to the laptop. Hence I had to returned it."
3,"Like it, but some computers don't","When I originally set this up, everybody (computer) liked it. After a while one of the machines turned off it's video and that started the problems. Maybe the unit needs an external power supply, but I could not diagnose and fix the problem easily. I did like it while it worked. I bought it to make my life easier at work. I am now going to take it home to see if I can find a use there."
2,USB connection stopped working after 1 year.,"We bought this KVM switch in August 2011. It worked well until a year later, when the USB keyboard input stopped working. We're able to work around the problem pretty easily by just plugging the little USB wireless keyboard receiver into whichever computer we're using, but when it comes time to replace the KVM switch we'll be choosing a different brand."
2,Did not live up to my expectations,"I am running VMware desktop and this product is incompatible with it. Every time I open the VMware console, the kvm switch toggles my connection and disconnects it. I contacted the TrendNET support and their suggestion was to contact VMware to resolve this issue. Besides this, I have experienced keyboard and mouse connection issues occasionally that required me to unplug all the cables and plug it back in to get everything working again. Do not buy this if you use or plan to use virtualization. Otherwise, carefully consider the alternatives before buying this cheap product."
4,Worked perfectly for two years,I have had this KVM at work for just over two years and I didn't have any trouble using it with my two ubuntu machines. Then today it suddenly stopped working. I guess for the price two years isn't bad.
5,hardware switch is great,"switches KVM well between a laptop and a tower. I love the hardware switch with 2 buttons instead of hitting scroll lock or some other keyboard trick. Comes with all the needed cables, and is ready to use right our of the boxk,"
3,Great but don't use with Vista if changing constantly,This is a really nice gadget for usb and vga connections only. I found that the cable is way too long for my needs. Cable might be thinner if possible. It worked as soon as I plugged it in.Cons:-It takes way too long to find the right resolution when you switch to the computer running Vista-Cables are thick and can be shorter-Does not work if you only want to use it to switch the monitor and not the usb peripheralsIt is the best Switch kit for the $20 i payed for it.
2,worked ok . and then stopped working,I bought his to use at work where I was going to share 2 laptops with a monitor. (At home I have a great KVM from connectpro. )The unit worked for a while (a month or so) then I noticed that I would have to reboot computers every now and then to get video signal or mouse or keyboard signal. Then I had to do it almost every time I wanted to switch computers. What a hassle. Don;t bother with this one if you are using laptops. (one was a DEll (worked fine) the other was an HP on a docking station (this is the one that gave all the trouble)
2,What they don't say,"I bought this to hook up two computers at home, both under my desk. Trendnet TK207K can ONLY use 4 ft cables so I can not use it for my set up.No where did it say anything about the cables being 4 ft long or that longer cables could not be use with this KVM. In fact they go to great lengths to hide this fact. I searched the net looking for a new KVM as I gave my old one to my grandson. Cable length of others are 6 ft so I gave it no thought when I did not see a length listed. When I opened the box and found 4 ft cables I went to the site to find longer cables. There I found no cables listed for the TK207K, though some longer cables were listed for other KVMs. On the FAQ page I found that the only supported length of cable was 4 ft. An inquiry to support gave me the answer that 4 ft was the longest length I could use with this KVM."
2,Cables not ideal,"I'd like to see the cables all come off one side of this device. As it is now, there is no front and back to it, so it's not so clean looking on the desk. Also, I have one side plugged into my Dell E series laptop, and the cables are not long enough to reach either side of the laptop, where the RGB and USB ports are. I have no idea why the Trend people did that. Seems unecessary. So, can't use this for an E4300 series laptop, unless I get a docking station."
1,"It was convenient, but broke in 3 weeks","I was very happy when I got this KVM switch. It really solved my problem with using 2 PCs and 1 display. It took almost no time while switching from one machine to another. But in about 3 weeks of use it stopped recognizing the mouse and keyboard. After 3 reboots it revived for one day and then died finally. I didn't use my computers for a long period of time and it was strange. Now I am using same type of a unit by AirLink, and it takes a while longer to switch between the machines. I have just purhcased it and I don't know how long it would last."
5,Awesome kvm switch,I loved using this kvm switch. I have had no problems with it . I am using it only with ubuntu and windows. Haven't tried out mac yet.Will updated this space if I try that . the kvm switch worked flawlessly and coolest part was the 4 cables that came along with it.-Himanshu
4,Impressive!,A very clever little box. No PSU required. The integrated Video/USB connection makes connection a breeze. The only little irritation is a slight delay when switching from on PC to the other.
4,"it works... it WORKSss!!! imagine that!, a KVM that DOES work!","I had previously purchased an elegant IOgear (GCS632U) but the thing only worked sporadically. I have my KVM connected to a pair of Ubuntu computers.This little Trendnet JUST WORKS!!!!Note to ubuntu (linux?) users: hit num-lock twice instead of scroll-lock two switch screens (or press the buttons on the switch).PRO:1) It works perfectly (stable image, 1-2 sec switching etc...)2) It's cheap!CON:1) They could use a new hardware designer (ugly/clumsy boxes)2) The cables are a bit short, usable but it could benefit from an added 12-18"" of cable."
3,It's ok....,"It can't really handle a wireless setup, but for $25 why should it?Sometimes hangs, other times it's spot on. Who knows."
1,Poor quality video,"I had very poor quality video using this with a Dell LCD. When driven by my Windows laptop, there was display jitter that I couldn't get rid of, no matter how I tuned the LCD. When driven by my Linux desktop, everything was a little fuzzy. (Much less distracting than the jitter, but still annoying.) In the end, I use it for switching keyboard and mouse, but switch the monitor connections manually..."
3,Time of Death = 14 months,"I was happy with this switch while it lasted. The construction looked a little cheap, but it was functional and didn't take up too much space on my desk. I used this unit to switch a monitor and my wireless keyboard & mouse between 2 different desktops (linux) and a laptop (windows 7). I started having intermittent problems after about 14 months of daily use. Initially it struggled to switch the monitor on the first try. Within a month it was unresponsive."
2,Falls short,"For certain reasons, I cannot use Num Lock to switch between computers. The reason I bought this particular KVM switch was so I would not have to use the manual methods of switching - I have to switch manually. It would have been nice if I could choose which key is programmed for switching. The scroll lock method falls short as well. I have a Linux computer in my array. If I press scroll-lock, scroll-lock, 1 to take me to my Windows 7 computer on port 1, I am taken to my Linux computer on port 3 and cannot move from there except by manually selecting. The software supplied does not run on a Linux machine. I called customer support and they were of no help. I could have purchased a much cheaper device."
1,Quit Working,"After just 3 weeks, it simply quit working. Now this is the third one I've tried in the last year and they all fail sooner rather then later."
3,It might be good if you are not using VMWare,"I've seen many comment on its placement of the connections, one each side making it a pain. Ok, that's true. My problem is I use VMWare often. When I move my mouse into the VM the KVM thinks I did something and it changes to the next computer. I then have to press the button on top switch.Even with the slight hassle of hitting the button now and then after going into a VM, it's still worth it.Other than it's funny plug locations on all sides, and the VM issue, its fine."
4,Good performance for the price,"I have had this KVM switch for about 2 months now. No problem encountered so far. Compared to 2-port IOGear KVM I used in the past, it is comparable in performance while cheaper.I have 2 Windows XP machines and 1 Ubuntu connected to this switch.For some reason, I have to hit Num Lock instead of Scroll Lock whenswitching out of Ubuntu. That's no problem as long as it works.It seems to take about 2 seconds to switch between machines, which is acceptable though a bit slower than IOGear.One thing I found out is that if a machine is down, you cannot switch out of it until it completely boots again. This may be more than an inconvenience. I am not sure if that was the case with IOGear, or all other KVMs.All in all, this KVM works for me well, and the price was right.In any event, that would be bad if a machine"
1,Sending back.,"This device does not display when connected to Linux box. Customer support was not very helpful, and could not resolve the issue. Sending item back."
4,Between a vista machine and an XP machine,I got this product quickly and it worked as advertised and it does it well. I was disappointed that I had to buy extra adapters to get from USB (on the box) to the PS2 on the XP machine. I'd recommend theTRENDnet USB to PS/2 ConverterThe Vista machine didn't even burp once. All works well except the adapter issue and for a good price too!
3,KVM,Gave this item as a Christmas present to my son. He said the item works as expected and a good bargin for the price.
3,Defective Unit-stuck for postage,Switch arrived promptly but video feed did not work. Called and was given return instructions and UPS return label. Refund issued for amount of purchase only leaving me to pay the original postage. Personnel polite. Technical service answered within five minutes and tried to help. Think my non-working unit was a fluke rather than the norm.
1,Trendnet KVW switches. Do not work with certain O/S and no response from seller,I have ordered the Trendnet KVW switches in the past but they doe not work with either Windows Vista OR Windows 7.I wrote to the manufacturer to ask for a driver. They never responded.Threw it out.
1,I guess you get what you pay for,"Run, do not walk away from this switch. Had a PS/2 port go out on one of my computers so I was no longer able to use my old Belkin KVM. Read the reviews here and decided for under $20 I would take a chance on it. Big mistake. Have had it hooked up for less then 4 hours and have had to repeatedly unplug the cables to get it to ""sync"" back up. If you do a lot of switching back and forth, which I do because I have one computer for work and the other for play, the lights will just start to flash and the computer will not recognize the mouse and keyboard. So I've had to unplug the cables and few times already to get it reset."
1,Doesn't work very well. I am looking to get a better one.,I've been using for three months. It doesn't switch instantly -- always a delay. Sometimes the other computer completely freezes up--about once a day. Totally underwhelmed by Trendnet. I wonder if the rave reviews were planted? I fell for the cheap price. I bought this based on one of the multi-star recommendations that appear here. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1,Stops working after a few weeks,"After a couple of weeks the mouse stopped being recognized by either laptop. No problem. I just started using a separate mouse for each. Then, a week later, the keyboard stopped being recognized by either laptop. I tried using a separate keyboard for each. But, that was not very convenient. The mouse and keyboard still work fine when plugged directly into either laptop. So, I know the KVM switch is at fault."
1,A waste of money,"It worked great for a month and then the USB circuitry quit working. The KVM is now just a V since K and M are USB. Other reviewers have also had this happen. If you want to roll the dice on this one go ahead. But for me, it's a cost-reduced piece of garbage. I'd return it, but it's not worth the hassle."
1,Don't expect this to last....,"I purchased this item last year for a Christmas. I never opened it up until June 2011 after I set up my computers. It was great. I was able to do multiple tasks on each computer and switch back and forth with the hot keys. Then in September, the keyboard and mouse stopped working. Everything still works but the ports that have the wireless mouse and keyboard do not. I contacted Trendnet and they do not want to do anything about it. It is a real hassle to switch the keyboard and mouse to different computers. So if you are going to buy something, be sure to make sure the company will back up their product."
1,Poor Functionality,"I work in the emergency communications field where reliability is a must! We just had our old USB switch (which worked flawlessly, wish I could remember who made it) repaced with this one. I do NOT recommend this one for the following reasons:a) Slow switching. We use 3 of the 4 ports and switching is very slow (3-4 second lag time). Unacceptable in my line of work.b) Single directional switching. If there's a 'reverse' function, I am unaware of it. And if I'm unaware of it then it can't be very user friendly.c) It ""crashes"" a lot. Probably a couple times a week in 24/7 operation. When it crashes you have to unplug all your devices so that it can power-down.Again, I do not recommend this product for anything more than ""casual"" use."
4,Trendnet TK-407K Review,"USB KVM's have their inherent quirks because if you go to shut a pc down, you lose the USB communications which means you HAVE to hit a switch to move focus to another computer. Trendnets are about as good as you are going to get in the cost-effective KVM's. Definitely preferred the PS2 but it's going away. Keyboards and Mice should be dedicated interfaces so that they are always operational. One engineer's opinion."
5,Plug and Play,"This was a super easy install and worked out of the box. I have desktop and often use a work laptop. I just plug in the cords and hit the button... the monitor, keyboard and mouse switch over right away.Cheap and performs as stated.I would recommend to this to a friend."
1,"You get what you pay for, JUNK",If you do purchase this device make sure you write down the serial number. Supposedly there's a sticker on the back that has the serial number on it. My switch failed after a week. Since there was no serial number on my device the manufacturer has decided not to provide product replacement even though it's their unit and has their name on it.
1,Not a quality product,"I owned this product for a VERY short period of time and it completely stopped functioning. I contacted TrendNet and they happily offered to exchange it, and the 2nd one also went out after a few weeks. Their response? They'd be happy to send me another one. I work in our firm's Technology Department and I've never seen quality KVM switches go back this fast. They product is shoddy and Amazon should consider dropping it."
1,Horrible product,I bought this item about six months ago (Sept 2009). It barely last till the end of the year.The screen started turning redish in Dec 09 a due to some malfunction of the wire and by January it just stopped working altogether.
4,Little Walter Tape,"I had lost a friend's audio cassette of Little Walter's songs. Luckily, this source was able to get me a replacement quickly - cassette tapes are not easily found today and neither is music like on this cassette. Very good service!"
2,Just doesn't work for me.,"This movie just didn't hold my interest or offer anything spectacular. The sets I didn't like at all - everything looked artificial and felt too new for a period piece. I had a lot of hope for this film, as I am a big fan of most movies set during this time and of Ewan McGregor, but this just didn't work for me. Richard E. Grant's character was too unbelievable and overacted. Worth renting, maybe, but not owning. I'm selling my copy."
2,Slow moving historical drama--,"Although generally a fan of ""period piece"" films this one is a bit thin in terms of story. Good actors wasted on a low-budget effort with a plodding, slow moving plot revolving around a rich merchant's garden and a romance between his daughter and the gardener."
2,Not really worth the effort,"I purchased this DVD based on the previous reviews and the... price tag, but it still wasn't worth it. I'm a fan of McGregor, but this isn't one of his better efforts. I had no trouble understanding the story, it just never caught my interest. Try something else."
3,"Great acting, average movie.","It helped to read a review of the movie before I watched it, otherwise I would not have understood the premise of the movie as you are almost finished watching before you realize why things are being done the way they are. Orignially watched this movie to see Pete Postelwaite and Ewan McGregor (Love them both) but was carried away by Richard Grant. I really enjoyed his character, and the portrayals by all of the actors were very well done. The movie itself is a little on the slow moving side. Does not require an R rating-Have seen PG movies with far worse language than this movie, and there is no nudity or graphic violence. I guess one F*** reduces you to an R...All in all, not a bad rental, or if you are a big fan of any of the actors, it is worth owning just for the wonderful acting."
2,Not Worth The Price.,"I may like Pokemon cards, but since I already have the whole collection of the first two sets this new reprint vertion is just plain useless to me. Plus they left out some of my favorite cards (Like Mr. Mime), so this was another minus. Unless you have no way of getting the original sets than I recomend this. If you do, then skip this and support new cards insted of reprints."
2,don't bye these base 2 packs,"In every base 2 pack I have gotten an item finder. Talk about boring! The jungle are better but they arn't good either.Bye Team Rocket,Starter (should be base set)and fossil."
4,A collection of Canadian & Mexican Myths & Legends,"One hundred & four legends & tales. 65 from Canada, the rest from Mexico.A great deal of material on First Peoples/First Nations traditions.Not politically correct.Then again, collected long ago, when these tales were commonly told, so they might be closer to authentic."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this recordind, partly due to the slow pace of the drumming. The other issue was the poorly audible rattle sounds. I had read the other reviews and the CD sounded great. If you are used to a fairly rapid rate of drumming, this recording will take some getting used to."
5,Very Impressed,"I had heard the Hey Young World song on a jazz station and absolutely loved it. I never imagined that the entire CD would be as good. I could listen to this CD over and over again. If you are in to hip hop, rap and all that, THIS IS NOT the CD for you. But if you like old school songs with a twist of jazz acoustics, you will love this. I recommend it to anyone, it just depends on your taste in music."
5,Great Video For Little Kids,"This was a great video that I saw on TV this morning. In this episode, Molly and Loonette learn about the word why. Major Bedhead delivers a special package for Loonette which is a rod that tells why something happens. When Loonette and Molly read a story about why, Loonette sings a song called I Wonder Why in the story. Get this video today and see if you can get your child to say why."
2,Work great but crack from heat.,"This lights look great and perform very well, but I have already had two glass lenses crack on me. They just seem to be prone to cracking (from heat). I even had the clear plastic rock guards on them the second time. You end up wasting money on replacing the lenses, get better lights right away."
5,fog lights,These lights are an excellent value. Paired with hella 500 pencil beams I do not fear the dark (or fog)
4,Franti Bridges Cultural Gaps,"Franti does a great job at dispelling several commonly held beliefs about inbred hatred and injustice, at the same time giving a voice to people we don't ever see on the American news. Whether Muslim or Jew, Iraqi or American, we all fundamentally want peace for our families--and because this message doesn't serve corporate America and its warmongerers, the mainstream media doesn't bother to investigate it. Franti goes in with a guitar and a camera and reveals the humanity behind the opposing ideologies surrounding this delicate issue. Some moments in the film have the feeling of being overly precious, but this does not detract from the movie's moving message."
5,Human stories from the Middle East,"I've never seen a more realistic and hopeful picture of humanity in a documentary. Michael Franti travels barefoot to the Middle East with guitar and heart in hand. Micheal has an incredible ability to find the real story from every side of the complex and troubling unrest in the Middle East. Interviewing young soldiers and citizens throughout the region, Franti manages to disarm everyone with his easy idealistic manner and soulful music. Even the most frightened and defensive find themselves opening up to Franti, explaining their motivations and showing their humanity in a way that most seasoned news reporters fall short of accomplishing. Franti not only manages to get a real and true picture of the people of the region, he also manages to act as a one man civilian peace negotiator, helping mortal enemies to bare their souls to each other, rather than just bearing arms. Oh for an army of barefoot guitar playing Frantis to disarm this world!"
1,Social Irresponsible!!!,"Can you call this a documentary? What is the point of sharing an ignorant, shallow perspective of a very complicated issue? It feels like Michael Franti spent a handful of days in Palestine and Israel without any prior knowledge of the issues, pointed his camera and came back with footage- calling it a documentary. It's slanted, it lacks depth, and that is not responsible film making. It's cheap and very socially irresponsible!"
2,When the Bulb Burns out you are screwed,The product works great. I used it in a pantry in my kitchen. Its plenty of light and for about 8 months worked flawlessly. But then the bulb blew out. The warranty doesn't really cover it so all you can dois purchase it all over again. Not a great investment and some questionable truth in advertising.
1,Burned out in 2 months!,"So much for the 10-year warranty. My father purchased two of these bulbs. They burned out within two months. They weren't even as bright as my bedside lamp. The pull chain broke on one, and my dad had to repair it. Unfortunately, the other pull chain jammed, and he couldn't fix it. Do not waste your time or money!As Seen on TV ""Stick Up Bulb"""
1,A Waste of Money!,I really liked the idea and purchased this light thinking it would easily solve the problem for lighting in my son's closet. The light is very dim even with fresh batteries. Still couldn't see items in closet. And they eat up batteries very very quickly...four at a time. Very expensive to have to replace batteries every few times you use the light. Don't recommend for any reason. Simply not an effective solution.
5,Great product when you just want to shed a little light!,"This light isn't pretty but it works great for a 92 year old woman who wants a little extra light in a closet. It's easy to install and it's easy for her to use, just pull the little string. It is not a light bulb in the traditional sense but looks like one. We installed it low and it gives just the right amount for her to see things lower in the closet. We installed our original light more than 2 years ago and the original batteries just recently went out. We ordered a second one because one of her friends saw it in the closet and wanted one."
1,Don't buy this,Don't waste your money. bright for the first 2 weeks and that's it. It looks like a dull candle in our hall closet. I think we are going to be buying batteries for it every two weeks.
4,Pretty Good Overall for the Price.,The sticky adhesive seems to hold it well to my wall and the light is decent enough.My only negative is it eats up your batteries.You could prolly find a LED light that is cheaper and brighter but these are ok too.
2,A little disappointed,"I purchased this product for a closet that I use to keep my ""home workshop"" in.....my tools, screwdrivers, etc. The light is barely bright enough to see anything. I was hoping to avoid hiring an electrician to install a real light fixture, but it looks like I'm going to have to."
1,REALLY BAD,A WASTE OF MONEY.THE LIGHT IS SO SO BAD I put it in my closet close to my shoes and I couldn't even see them.Plus it consumes the battery's life even when you turn it off.
2,limited light,"I found the product to be deficient in the amount of light; it will hardly light any room.it is easy to move from one place to the other, but its advantages don't make it very practical."
4,Just the thing for unlighted areas,"I've always looked for lights that are useful in areas where reaching electricity is difficult. This light is excellent. I use it primarily in a garage storage area that has few outlets for electricity and always a spot that needs light. However, if you forget and leave it on for an extended period, it will use up the battery quite quickly. Best for short lighting projects."
3,More for practitioners than patients/clients,"Although I enjoyed this book, I felt it was meant more for Healing practitioners than for patients or clients themselves. I have done energy healing work for people in the past, and have read a lot of books on different types of energy work, so I was already familiar with most of what was written. I think it would be of interest to Naturopaths and other doctors who practice natural healing modalities such as Homeopathy, Chiropractic, or Acupuncture. I think it would also be eye-opening to folks who are totally new to the idea of energy healing."
1,This was not the book I was expecting,"After a very long preface and introduction, this book turned each chapter into a story of how a client was put ""into a deeply relased state"" and meridians were tapped and then the person was all better. They were also taught to continue these processes alone. Meditation and self-hyponosis are well known to be helpful to one's soul, but I found the endless ""case studies"" repetative and boring. I never made it to the end, where the techniques for tapping one's meridians were to be sxplained. I found this book to be centered on the author, with lots of stories about people she helped, which all began to sound alike after the eighth or ninth one. I am sorry that I got it and wasted my time on it."
5,Groundbreaking integration of EFT into HypnoTherapy!,"As a new hypnotherapist years ago, I was told of Marilyn Gordon in revered terms by my colleagues. Seeing her teach and reading this book transformed me, inspired me. My eyes were open to the integration of EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) into already powerful hypnotic techniques for enhanced success. I referred to this book over and over as I started my new journey into the world of EFT. I am grateful for Marilyn and this book for bringing 2 tranformative healing tools together."
1,Garbage.,"This book is an utter waste of time. A two year old could come up with these quotes. Quotes like, "" Have your suits cleaned often"" and ""Take your assistant to lunch, but not too often"" are examples of how little thought went into this book. If you find this book helpful you should be worried. Thank goodness I didn't buy it."
1,junk,"worked for 4 months then the clutch burned -up. Piece of junk, emailed seller about warranty and got no replyStill unresolved, company doesn't appear to have very good record keeping, they sold this as ""new"" but its notits either rebuilt, reconditioned or a cleaned up used compressor- don't be suckered into cheap prices-you don't get what you pay for."
1,Do Not Buy This Book,I created a pure bred breed of Bulldog in the 1970's and followed the Koehler technique to the letter. It is all about correction and not communication and teamwork. I hate to remember the things I did to dogs under Koehler's direction. You start the training by presenting a sudden distraction to the dog and then you drop the 25' long line (holding its end loop to your chest) and then run as fast as you can in the opposite direction. The object is to flip the dog over backwards. I wonder how many dogs' neck vertebrate were permanently crippled doing this. To teach a difficult dog not to chew objects in the house Koehler recommends putting big pieces of the destroyed item in the back of the dog's mouth and then you tape the dog's mouth shut and leave them gagging for way too long. These are just 2 over the top examples of the Koehler Technique.I am lucky enough to have learned from some of the world's most gifted protection trainers and not one would use this outdated method.
1,Completly outdated,"Do not buy this book, the information here is too old. If you really want to learn something take a look at Ed Frawleys videos and then search for an author that deals with solid and modern techniques. I got this book a long time ago and now that I train dogs for a living I know that I wasted my money."
1,A very cruel method of dog training,"This book has some very cruel methods of training a dog. Dogs should not be fearful when being trained and treated with cruelty. The ASPCA should be informed of these people.Sorry, but I would not recommend this method of training at all!"
1,Breaks too easily,"We bought this for our 9 year old. It broke within a month of having it- fell off our table and the side cracked when set up for drawing. The Company was not helpful at all- did not offer to fix or replace it at a lesser cost (we paid the full price $40) might be good for teens, but not for anyone younger."
5,great art toy,this was very well received and she plays with it a lot. reminds me of the aqua doodle but more sophisticated.
4,Maybe I need to fish more!,"Fast read. Action packed. I enjoyed the old mans method of telling the story. As the saying goes: ""there are more things in heaven and earth...."""
2,not to bad,"not the best PA ive read but still worth the time if you like the genre, i found it imaginative and the action pretty steady"
2,New Book by Keene??,"As I began this book I was reminded of Keene's 2005 book: EARTHWORM GODS.Oh, wait, this IS that book.This is an ""alternate title re-release"".This is NOT a sequel to EARTHWORM GODS, it's the same book.No one selling this book makes that very clear."
3,2/3 of this book was good,"Part I and Part III of this book was good. Part II was useless information. The main character, Teddy, should have been at least 20 yrs younger to do the physical stuff he did. The ending was weak. Too much like the movie, ""Tremors,"" only less exciting.-- review from the author of The Shadow God and Spiritual Sorrow."
1,Why is the book considered horror??,"This is the second Keene novel I've read and the last.Once again the only good thing is the book was free.This book,like The Rising, is filled with cliches and sterotypes.I nodded off several times while trying to get through it.The second half of the book made me laugh at the author's clumsy attempt at characterization.It's like he watched a late-night '80s creature feature and thought,'That would make a great book except my version will be deep and serious'.The book is so booooring and dreary.The ending was Mr.Keene's usual cliffhanger style.Since the remaining characters still have their cardboard personalities firmly in tact,it didn't matter to me either way what happened next."
4,Soda Stereo es el mejor grupo de Rock en Español!,"Con respecto a estos discos ambos son muy buenos, tu puedes escuchar la madurez de Soda Stereo en cada una de sus canciones. La guitarra de Cerati es genial y además mezclan nuevos instrumentos. A mi no me interesa si son dos discos o uno, simplemente disfruto cada uno de ellos. No creo que Cerati este haciendo el negocio de su vida."
5,The best recopilation of Soda Stereo's songs.,"Soda Stereo is the best music band in all the types of music, and I'm not being subjective, no no, it is the truth. And this cd has, in my opinion, the best songs Soda Stereo has ever produced."
2,No vale la pena,"No me parece que Soda Stereo sea una banda muy interesante, ni mucho menos la mejor banda de hablahispana como algunos dicen. Algunas pocas canciones son lo unico rescatable. Y lamento mucho por los fans lo averrante que fue haber editado el ultimo concierto en dos discos!!! Hay otras bandas argentinas con mas trayectoria y mejores compositores, como Los Enanitos Verdes (Marciano Cantero es el mejor compositor de hablahispana), Los Redonditos de Ricota, Andres Calamaro, Charly Garcia, y muchos mas. Soda Stereo no existe."
4,buena,"La mercancia es de buena calidad, y llego a tiempo segun lo establecido en el sistema. Lo recomiendo ... Venezuela"
2,Not impressed,"For the price I paid, I was very disappointed in this eyeliner. It does not go on dark, and it faded from my eyes within an hour or so. I bought it in black, and the color came out looking gray because the color pigments your skin so lightly. I've had better luck with much cheaper drugstore brands."
5,Good Product worth your money!,LANCOME you are the leading in makeup products the Waterproof is the best I have tried so far and believe me I have tried them all. Thanks Amazon your lead in providing your customers with the best quality products thank you once again. A very satified customer I will keep ordering from you to include your super fast delivery.
2,"24p Pamphlet on Finnish and Russian combat methods, organization and equipment","Warfare in the Far North, by General of Infantry Dr. Waldemar Erfurth; 24 pp, 1 map; DA Pamphlet No. 20-292; 1951.This is a 24 page pamphlet covering Finnish and Russian combat methods, organization and equipment and Finnish climate and terrain. It's a military document pure and simple. Not for a light read and hard to obtain, altho occassionally a copy pops up.ETHINT is a contraction of ""European Theater Historical Interrogations."" These manuscripts record the first American historical interviews with German officers, including some of very high rank, in the immediate postwar period. A few of these officers have made more complete and accurate reports at a later date. Most of the interrogations were conducted at Bad Mondorf, Luxemburg in the summer and autumn of 1945."
5,A Great Sourcebook,"I am a documentary photographer, specializing in endangered historic buildings. Having explored New England for a number of years, I am in the process of moving to Charlotte, NC.This book will be the starting point for my work in the south. It is well organized, with sites listed by counties and there are clear maps. The book is detailed, with a good basic history of the area at the beginning. A particularly nice feature is the notation as to whether a site is private, open to the public or may just be viewed from the highway. I also own the Guide to the Historic Architecture of Western North Carolina and find it equally valuable."
3,Hoyt,Not exactly gold but maybe bronze would be a better title. It has some very nice tracks but the main are just fillers in my opinion and I don't say that lightly having been a Hoyt Axton fan since the early/mid seventies. I bought this album to satisfy my curiosity and don't necessarily regret that decision but don't pay too much for this album.
5,Just the support I needed,These were perfect for my aging truck suspension. They really rejuvenated my tired leaf springs. brought my 1992 Dakota back to it's rated capacity.I can't tell you how happy I am with the price and quality.
4,Great Shocks Great Price,"Bought a '95 Dakota used and always thought the original OEM shocks would've been shot at 90K. It was mushy and very wallowy. As I would use it as a truck to do things around the house I went with the load adjust shocks (they have an add coilover spring) along with front Monroe's at the same time. The overall effect of the set was a positive and noticeable. I recently hauled 6 bed loads of dirt, (9 wheelbarrows per) and it sagged down some, but I would have never been able to do that with standard shocks. If you plan to load or tow, they're worth the extra money. Best of all I don't notice any adverse effect to the ride or handling when unloaded. The 80.56 price for a set and free ship was the lowest I found at the time."
4,Not a bad book,I built a 383 stroker for my 68 ElCamino runs good. It did help me with setting up the roller rockers and choosing the correct ones. But it's actually cheaper to buy a crate motor with a warranty and you have tech support unless your a diehard.
5,great debut cd,"i got this cd after their new cd division and i have to say i like this one better. division has some good songs but isnt as complete as the autumn effect. every song on this cd is good. you can listen to the whole cd without skipping a song. my favorites are wasteland, through the iris and fault line. they sound a bit like a perfect circle but i like 10 years better than apc. the singer has a great voice and these guys should be around for awhile. great job"
4,Easily enjoyable,"Bands in the vein TrustCo and A Perfect Circle may seem like a distant memory amidst the pop/emo crap that currently saturates modern music, but if you take the time to explore, you'll once in a great while find a band worthy of your time. Take 10 years. They had a minor hit with wasteland, but you probably haven't heard them on the radio more than once or twice. A shame really, because the music on 'the autumn effect' is truly timeless stuff. If you enjoy staind, apc or trust company at their finest, you'll like 10 years for sure. Agressive rock with a more than subtle melodic touch. Check it out."
5,Great!,"Great band, even better live. So, what other bands can you say are even better live than what they are on their album? None. What would you give a band that is just that? Five stars. Now this isn't saying that the album sucks, it truly is mind-blowingly good, but them live- Dear lord, it's like you've gone to heaven. But when it ends, it's like you've been slammed into hell. This is a must have CD, it's really great."
5,Tool-lite,"Just wanted to add to all of the positive reviews.The Autumn Effect is Tool-lite, which is not a bad thing at all. (Being compared to one of the greatest bands of all time is a compliment.) The lead singer shares the same vocal range/talent as Maynard, and the music is layered similarly to Tool, just not as heavy. Tool just has a sound that cannot be duplicated.I don't have any favorite tracks as of yet... the album has been consistently pleasing to listen to, yet they all stand out in their own way... something not many modern rock bands can pull off anymore these days.Anyways, blah blah blah... borrow it from a friend or just go out and buy it, you won't be disappointed."
5,Go Buy It!,"Well, I just finished listening to this CD and it honestly took my breathe away. It's unbelievable, my sister, who's a local DJ convinced the station to give out thirty copies of the CD. She, the radio station, and I all know that this is going to be a band for the ages.13. The Autumn Effect 5/512. Paralyzing Kings 5/511. Insects 5/510. Prey 5/59. Empires 5/58. Through The Iris 10/57. Half Life 10/56. Seasons To Cycle5. Wasteland 10/54. Cast It Out 5/53. The Recipe 10/52. Fault Line 10/51. Waking Up 5/5"
4,A Solid Debut,"Although nothing overtly ground-breaking, these guys are an insightful band that crafts intelligent, thoughtful, and well-rounded rock. The first listen may not be particularly enticing, but a few journeys through this album will let it prove itself beyond a doubt.10 Years is clearly a young band, and the influences are evident: if you're a fan of A Perfect Circle or even Trapt, for instance, you'll love these guys. That's not to say they're a knock-off band; there's plenty of originality in most of the songs, and what isn't new is welcome territory.All in all, a well-done, solid debut from a group that's going to be really exciting to watch mature: for the price, this one's a steal."
3,Decidedly average,"I like that 10 years is putting out music with some depth. As many have pointed out, they can get a bit tool-esque (although the vocals are different). They seem to be trying hard to be deep, and at times I feel like they're trying too hard. The album has it's highs, and I'm a big fan of half-life, but not much else. Decent but very average."
5,My most anticipated album of the year!!,"This album deserves no comparison! It's in a class all it's own. You will not find another album quite like this one. I've followed the band from the beginning and am most certainly not dissapointed with the major label debut. Seems a little more radio friendly than the pre-label work but is most certainly the most rocking album out especially that has lyrics that actually mean something. Jesse's lyrics speak for themself. The album is worth every dime! If you have any chance to see the live show, the album doesn't even hold a candle!"
3,Solid album from an underrated band,I feel this band is underrated as this is a very solid album. Not one skippable song on here. Sorta sounds like perfect circle a little bit but in no way am I comparing the two just trying to give a new listener an idea on what style of rock this is. The singer is great and they have a great production team that makes each song flow smoothly into the next. Nothing generic like the radio generally feeds us. Highly talented musicians for this genre of music which is why they are really underrated where bands that just suck like Nickelback get all of the attention. They instrumentally destroy them. The only issue is there is nothing that truly stands out and makes you go wow this is awesome just background music not much more really. Again i do recommend this band for someone out there needing a new cd to pick and not happy with what radio gives you this is a solid album that you will enjoy just dont expect something spectacular imo
4,Solid Rock CD,"Intelligent, melodic rock music. Not much of this is made today as kids music tastes have been warped by all the rap and hip-hop played on the airwaves. If you like Chevelle and Evans Blue then you will appreciate this cd."
4,"""Change my attempt, good intentions...""","A few weeks ago, I went to a show at Jester's Pub in Ft. Bragg, North Carolina with a few cool people. The headlining band was 10 Years. I had never heard of these guys before, that is until I heard them perform ""Wasteland."" Then I said to myself, ""These are them!""So I came home and borrowed the CD from a friend. And I was so amazed! The CD is really good in general. My favorite songs are Wasteland, The Autumn Effect, and Prey.The only thing I don't like about the CD is the fact that a lot of these newer bands do the same thing. They mainly sound like pansies. But it's the sound of the music itself that I care about the most.So 4/5 in my book."
3,IT'S COOL...,IF I HAD TO DECIDE BETWEEN THIS BAND AND EARSHOT (SINCE THEY BOTH SOUND LIKE TOOL/APC) I'D PICK EARSHOT AS THE MUSIC AND VOCAL MELODIES ARE ALOT MORE DEEPER AND MEMORABLE. STILL A GOOD ALBUM THOUGH.RANDY
5,What In The????,What in the heck is everyone's problem first off tool are not that great to begin with there are tons of better bands .Second ten years sounds like tool? are you kidding me there is no way in the world they sound the same because tool never sounded this good.If it isn't that some new band sounds like tool it's that the band can't hold a candle to them and you should run out and purchase a tool cd instead.Seriously i would love to see one cd review that doesn't reccomend tool or another band that is highly overated.Like i said i don't hear a likeness but if ten years was a tool clone that would be sad cause the clone would sound better then the real thing.
5,not tool,"first off how can you compare these guys to Tool or APC? Tool is unique and has it's own sound. even APC has a different sound as to Tool. That's what i like about 10 years, they are unique and fresh. Great lyrics, great music, what else do you need. But yeah u just don't compare anybody to Tool. they are their own sound. 10 years have their own sound as well so listen and judge for yourself, stand out tracks: ""Wasteland"", ""Through The Iris"" and ""Prey"" all great. Don't compare just listen"
4,Breakthrough artist of 2005,"I picked up this record after hearing ""Wasteland"" on the radio. After listening to the single about 20 times in a row... I checked out the other tracks. Amazing! 10 Years brings a fresh twist on a solid rock sound. 10 Years knows how to rock the guitars, while belting out some beautiful *maynard james keenan-like* vocals. Grab this cd now!"
5,What the music world was needing,"I must say that music has been in bad times recently, most of the new bands coming out all have the same message: ""I hate my life and I wear eye-makeup (please don't break up with me, I won't survive)."" Luckily, i heard 10 Years' track ""Wasteland"" on the radio and i was intrigued.Being a fairly new fan of A Perfect Circle and Tool, i found this band to sound reminiscent of the newer A Perfect Circle stuff, with a bit of dare i say...Crossfade or Breaking Benjamin in there. They are a great band, with great music, and they came at the right time. If you have been starving for the old style rock (Disturbed, Metallica, Smile Empty Soul, Seether, Incubus, etc.) then this band is for you. 10 Years has a sound that is like APC, but it still differs. All in all, their CD is enthralling, and songs like Wasteland and Through the Iris will leave you tingling inside.If you don't have it, get it, because they know what music is supposed to sound like."
4,"Killing All That Holds You (2004, EP, Reissue)","For those of you looking for the Killing All That Holds You EP, you can purchase it directly from the band off of their website. ([...]) It's in their Merch section. It is a full-length Reissue follow up to the original EP including 4 new studio tracks and 4 live acoustic tracks, along with the original EP, for a total of 14 tracks!"
5,A Truly Awesome Album,"this band has recently come to my attention, and i havent been able to get them out of my head since i first heard them. i have fallen in love with the band 10 years and their album the autumn effect! though i am usually first in my group of friends to hear and recommend new music, one of my friends turned me onto 10 years and i totally loved their song wasteland when i heard it on the radio. now i cant wait to see them live, because they are coming to NC in Feb. of 06 and im definitely going! its really a great rock album that will stay in your cd player or on repeat on your iPod for a long time to come!"
5,10 Years to long to wait for this album!,"If you like Trapt or Perfect Circle/ Tool, you will really dig this album. Pick it up if you have the chance. They kick A$$!"
4,It's pretty good!,"I really enjoy this CD. The guitar work is pretty good, and the drumming is pretty well layered in with all the instruments. The bass work is difficult to hear, though. I think the bass work could use some improvement so it isn't drowned out by all the other instruments.I like just about all songs on this CD (except maybe ""Wasteland,"" because it has been extremely overplayed).Great CD. Worthy of the money I spent for it and worthy of 4 stars."
3,"Good, but not great","3.5 stars. I know everybody else has already stated the obvious: Ten Years sounds like a Tool and A Perfect Circle hybrid. There is one other band that it seems Ten Years draws from and that is Anathema. If you like this band then perhaps you should check out these albums by Anathema: A fine Day to Exit and A Natural Disaster.I'll say that these guys are good, but there is something lacking on this album that I can't really put my finger on. The vocals are good as well as the music but it just doesn't reach it's full potential. Take that for what it's worth. Check out Anathema"
5,10 years GO GET IT!!,"I saw 10 years in concert a couple times and I was so impressed with there music that I picked up the cd after the first show. The guys are totally cool to staying after their set to meet with each fan. My favorite track if I had to pick one is track 03 ""The Recipe"".But the whole cd is awesome and anyone who likes rock music is guaranteed to like this cod ""The Autumn Effect"". So go get it it'll make the best Christmas stocking stuffer!"
2,Nothing New,"Perhaps Disturbed has 10 Years touring with them to make themselves sound better? Not that Disturbed needs anyone to make themselves sound better. But 10 Years could use some help.There is a familiar sound, like maybe Chevelle or Staind, to The Autumn Effect. That would be a compliment to some bands maybe, but 10 Years sound like they have put together a collection of what could be covers of the song-rejects from those bands' CDs.I bought this on Impulse after I heard the decent song Wasteland on Sirius radio and I also found out that they were touring with Disturbed. So 10 Years' The Autumn Effect just had to be good...it had to be...right? Well...the Autumn Effct is Nu Metal at its most generic. Very boring. A disk where the tracks all sound so much alike that you wouldn't even know that the track had changed if not for the numbered track indicator on your player.Absolutely nothing new here.Sorry, fans."
2,Will the real Maynard James Keenan please stand up?,"I can't believe it's not A Perfect Circle! The first time I heard this junk I thought it was a new Tool/APC song, but as soon as I realized it was just another crap copycat band, my respect for it went out the window. It's derivative music from an industry that does nothing but try to cram clones of clones down your throat and demand that you like it and pony up your 15 bucks. Broaden your horizons and break free from listening to the same old crap on top 40 radio. There are plenty of groundbreaking creative musicians out there who deserve your respect and attention, much more than these ""hey we wanna get on MTV so lets copy Maynard"" bands. BMG, Universal, and other record companies do not dictate what you, the consumer, should listen to. Support creativity!"
3,"REALLY GOOD BAND, BUT?","WHY DO ALOT OF THE LEAD SINGERS IN BANDS HAVE TO SOUND LIKE WHINNY LITTLE BABIES. I WAS READING SOME OF THE REVIEWS ON THESE GUYS AND AGREE WITH SOME OF THE TOOL COMPARISONS, WHICH UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD CRUCIFY THEM FOR, BUT IN THE CASE OF THESE GUYS THEY CAN PULL IT OFF BECAUSE THEY HAVE TALENT. AND THEY DO ADD ALITTLE OF THEIR OWN UNIQUE SOUND TO THE TABLE. AND EVEN WHEN COMPARING THE VOICES OF THE TWO YOU CAN SEE SIMILARITIES THERE AS WELL. BUT I THINK TOOLS FRONTMAN KNOW'S WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE FROM SOULFULL TO WHIMPY,WHERE AS THIS GUY BREAKS DOWN THE FREAKIN DOOR OF WEENY AND ANNOUNCES ""THIS IS FOR ALL OF THE LOVELY LADIES IN THE CROWD TONIGHT."" TO FU*KING BAD TO BECAUSE THE BAND REALLY ROCKS!"
5,better than tool,well this album is by far the best cd to come out in a long time.....the new tool cd is ok at best.....i can't believe you people want to rip on a band that you think sounds like tool.....10 yrs blows tool out of the water.....maybe if maynard would put more time in with tool and forget about a perfect circle the new tool cd would be better....a perfect circle is a total snore-a-thon.....
1,yuck,"this cd left me with a bad taste in my mouth. it seems like every song sounds the same, and the few that stand out get old too quick. the lyrics are boring on so many levels, and every other guitar riff and melody is stolen and re used without any sort of tweaking to make it atleast SOUND original (see ""through the iris"" for the most blatant example). ZzZzZzZ. if you need some background noise and are tired of using your coldplay and keane records as sleep aids, get 10 years. you 5 star reviewers are funny."
1,NOT TOOL,"ANYONE WHO HAS THE NERVE TO COMPARE THIS TOP 40 SLUSH TO SOMETHING GREAT LIKE TOOL SHOULD BE LOCKED AWAY AT ONCE! I HAVEN'T HEARD MUSIC THIS BAD SINCE NICKELBACK RELEASED ""THE LONG STUPID BORING AND FORMULAIC ROAD"". 10 YEARS IS YOUR A-TYPICAL RADIO-ROCK BAND, NOTHING MORE THAN A GLORIFIED CHEVELLE OR BREAKING BENJAMIN MASKED AS THE NEXT TOOL OR A PERFECT CIRCLE. SO STOP CALLING THEM TOOL. THEY COULD NEVER EVEN DREAM OF BEING HALF AS TALENTED."
1,How'd these guys get a record deal?,"I don't know how anyone can listen to this and not fall asleep! 10 Years could be a good band if they tried a bit harder, but they've got a few major hurdles to overcome before they get there.First, they need to stop emulating other bands, most notably, 30 Seconds to Mars and A Perfect Circle. You're better off picking up one of their albums, including 30STM's new one on August 30th. Wearing you influences on your sleeve would be a forgivable offense for a young band if they had any songwriting talent at all. The songs themselves fall flat, and are totally bland and unmemorable. They pretty much just plod along predictably, not really making an impression. They never really go anywhere except where you expect, and that's not what good rock is about.Bottom line, these guys are just plain boring. As stated before, pick up a CD from 30 Seconds to Mars or A Perfect Circle, those are actually worth money."
3,"Nice Plot Twists, Okay Characters","RLH certainly knows how to throw her poor characters for some crazy loops. That's how life is, so I love the realism. The ""letter"" chapters were all right; I liked the uniqueness of them. The characters seemed to learn alot, but overall, they struck me as too typical of the romantic, chick-flick lit sort of people."
3,Promised to Me,"This book was okay, but isn't one of my favorites. Jakob seemed so harsh. He always seemed to be upset. And I felt sorry for Lance. He was in love with such a loser. Charlotte is a character hard to understand. In one chapter she's all mean and spoiled. And in the next, she's feeeling bad for eavesdropping. The children were not realistic. They seemed too perfect. And it was hard to read because she kept throwing in all these German words. Some characters seemed to be crying every other page. Overall, this book wasn't bad. But I've definitly read better books. No offense."
5,Wonderful,"This was a great series, and one that kept my interest, right up to the very end. Great story line and I couldn't wait to get into the next book!!!!"
4,The Red Tent,"""The Red Tent"" was compelling and I couldn't put it down once I'd started it. All I can say is, ""Thank God I was born in the United States of America"". Women at that time and in that place were no more than chattel and completely dependent on men for their food and what type of home they lived in. There were, I'm sure, some men who were great husbands and fathers. Those women that were fortunate enough to end up with a husband like that were treated well, albeit virtual slaves. The others were just out of luck, for there were men that were cruel and mistreated their women and their children. This was a really good read."
4,A fascinating study,"This is an intriguing and very readable study of some of the most important members of government during the last years of Louis XIII's reign. It covers several areas: the working relations between Louis and Richelieu, and their joint relations with the secretaries and superintendants (all, by 1635, Richelieu's nominees); the responsibilities and restrictions of their various positions and their contributions to the power of the crown; and sketches of the individual ministers in question (Bullion, Bouthillier, Chavigny and Noyers).While this subject matter may sound dry it is not. The personalities of the king and his ministers are vividly delineated, as is the huge task facing them all during these war years. There are plenty of quotations from their correspondence (translated, fortunately) and many footnotes in the original French. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in the reign."
2,Too old fashioned!,"If you like the ""Cantinflas"" movies and you're over 45 -and have sentimental connections with Mexico- you might like this movie. But your children probably will not! This movie is simply too old-fashioned in every aspect.The only good scene is when they sing Cri-Cri's ""Marcha de las letras"" and all the cows move their tails to the rhythm.I bought it for my 3 y.o son and, like me, he didn't care for the movie at all."
4,"Great bit, would have preffered a 1/2"" shank.","Only complaint is that I couldn't get this bit in a 1/2"" shank. However, it has been used a reasonable amount with no wear. I expect this bit to last a long time and stay sharp enough for even the most demanding hardwoods."
1,THIS ITEM IS METRIC!,This item is advertised in inches but it only measures by the metric system. Don't buy it unless you want to convert all of your measurements each time you use it.
1,Whyyyyyyyyy!,Sourced from vinyl so it's not worth your time. It's a shame because Darrell deserves a proper release. Maybe someday.
4,Pretty good,Till now no problems in it... neither phone getting overcharged or anything else. In fact it gets charged much faster than the regular LG charger. Nice to buy in short.
1,worst knock offs ever!,I ordered this product thinking it'll look like the Steve Madden ones I have seen everywhere. This seemed to look exactly like the more expensive counterpart and it wasn't! i got the shoes and returned them immediately! the quality was SOOOO bad...it looked like it was falling apart (stitching on the inside and outside of the shoe) from the second I got it. I would never ever buy shoes from this company ever again. I returned it and bought the real Steve Maddens instead.
4,MORE PHOTOS PLEASE!!!,I LOVE WATCHING MARTIN YAN EVEN BEFORE I LIVED IN THE STATES.HIS FOOD ARE SO YUMMY N HE IS AN EXCELLENT COOK.SO I ADDED THIS BOOK TO MY COOKBOOK COLLECTION.I WAS JUST A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW PHOTOS.UNLIKE KYLIE KWONG COOKBOOK THE PHOTOS ARE AWESOME N IT MAKES YOU HUNGRY INSTANTLY.
3,A biography of the Little Magician.,"A nice little biography of the Little Magician. Wilmer gives us the low down on Van Buran who more formally organized the Democratic Party. Van Buren also gave the party structure, and did represent what he thought was right during both his Presidency and his many years in the wilderness. What surprised me is his contact with Lincoln both when Abe was a Congressman and during the Civil War. Van Buren was perhaps not one of the best Presidents, but he did represent his interests well. He survived a political struggle with the likes of Webster, Clay, and other prominent opponents.All of these books in the American Presidents series are for the most part well written. I thought this book rated well with the others in this series. Great information on little known leaders."
3,"Good Summary Read, Not Going to tell you Everything","I read this book simply wanting to learn more about Martin Van Buren than that he was the 8th President and was satisfied. This book did a good job of giving me an insight into Van Buren's life without giving me too many details. It is a good sparknotes of his life. If you have studied Van Buren this book will not tell you anything you don't already know.The writer does a good job of establishing a narrative of Van Buren's life as a builder of parties and his role in the Jacksonian Era both in helping elect him and later as a sage as the Country moved towards Civil War. However, his humor is not that funny. The author is like a professor who tries to tell jokes that are really not that funny and do not really help understand the topic. It does not take away from the narrative but, it is irritating."
2,"Fun read, but light on substance...","I can see why other reviewers would be put off by the somewhat colloquial language in the book. I actually found it to be very readable as a result of said language. But you still have to cover the historical aspects of the Presidency. Less than 50 of 172 pages cover the actual presidency, and you don't get there until page 93. If you're looking for a more historical work, see Major Wilson's book from the Kansas University series."
5,Great.,"The most important part of this book is the discussion about how Martin Van Buren pretty much created the two-party system in the U.S. The idea that an organization and it's policy positions should take precedence over any particular individual was an important change in American politics. Furthermore, it led to an important advance in the spreading of democracy in the U.S. Of course, as with all changes, these changes did not come without costs. But the country is, for the most part, better because of Van Buren's party leadership. As for his presidency, who cares?"
4,GOES THROUGH BULBS FAST,"I love the look of this, but it goes through light bulbs really fast.I couldn't get the bottom rung of the shade to pull down far enough, so I had to rig it with a hair band. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning."
5,Cheap and bright,Easy to assemble and 5'5'' as advertised. This makes a huge difference in my room as there is no ceiling light.
3,Rice lamp shade - good product,"This lamp gives a warm soft light to a dim room and adds a nice contemporary look. The only downfall is that when you pull the lamp shade down in order to hook it onto the stand, the shade will tear on the bottom of the shade, so you have to be very careful when pulling on the bottom of the lamp shade. Also, when assembling the stand, you have to push the cord into the rod of the stand, which is a tedious, time-consuming project, because they give you much more cord than you need. I like the foot button on the floor to turn the lamp on and off. Would buy this product again."
1,Crap,This is the biggest piece of crap video I have ever seen. Netflix should be ashamed they even have this video. Thats 10 minutes of my life I will never get back.
1,Unwatchable,"This ""documentary"" only consists of dated news footage and false narration that viewers are led to believe comes from a news team watching the events live. Garbage like this is only intended to plug holes in the video store shelf. I feel sorry for anyone who wastes any time with this video."
1,garbage,"this documentary open up on netflix, it sounded like an interesting one to watch, boy was I wrong. First all the vids they show are really old nothing past the rodney king beating and the LA riots which is the last one they show. At first I thought the narration was from the news staff in the helicopters because they have helicopter sound effects and radio transmission sound a like audio recordings. Then I realize it was just two guys making the worst documentary in history. The narrators are obviously anti police to the point that it is funny."
1,Cops Caught In The Act,"COMPLETE GARBAGE! NO REAL OFFICEER FOOTAGE DOING WRONG. A COUPLE BEATDOWN SCENES, BUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,"I would give it one star, but it made me laugh.","Let me tell you about this movie. There's these werewolves see, and it takes place in Australia, kay. Now these were""wolves"" are marsupials. I'm talkin werekangaroos, werewombats, etc... and there are these nuns, got it? And these nuns are evil, they kinda look like rats, still with me now? And then there's a town called Flow. (Pss, that spells wolf backwards, even though none of them are werewolves)Well there's this girl from 'Flow' and she hates being a werekangaroo, bla bla bla. She has kids in the end and dies, got it? Good, now do something better with your time and go look up reviews on GOOD movies, go ahead and stop reading this one. Just go."
1,werewolf drivel,"Doin't waste your time or money. This is a terrible not scary movie. Amateurish, poorly acted, no real special effects. Stick with the first movie."
2,HOWLING III,"Remember Seeing this when I was little it was scary then,but it doesn't make any sense. The 1st Howling is still the best one to see. all the others afterwards are just nonsense. they used to put this on tv alot."
2,"flopy,sucky.yucky!",I dont understand how some people can give this flick 4 stars!? I will not watch this movie again.
2,"Another worthless Howling sequel, though not the worst of the series","Philippe Mora, who directed the first Howling sequel, returned to the helm for Howling 3: The Marsupials, this time with more control over the film than he had on the previous worthless sequel. However, Howling 3 is really no different from the second film, the only difference being that this installment doesn't take itself seriously and even parodies itself. The storyline is non-sensical and the acting is atrocious, but there is a good looking babe as our werewolf main character, and some of the effects and makeup are decent. However, just like every other film in the exhausted series, this can't hold a candle to Joe Dante's original classic, and on it's own it doesn't hold up as a horror film. The following installments in the series would only get worse however, so if you're looking for some corny 80's werewolf fun you can still do worse."
5,A rational voice at last,"Most people base their opinion on crop circles on the little superficial and disinformative coverage in the media (apparently, like the previous superficial review). It's refreshing to finally have a truly scientific look at the REAL FACTS and then an equally rational attitude when it comes to drawing conclusions. That's what makes this book so riveting - you feel the author isn't trying to prove anything. His goal is the truth, no matter where it leads. And that kind of honesty is always appreciated, especially when it comes to something this hotly contested."
4,Good Reading,"This guy may be an old fuddy duddy English Chap, but he gets his point across in a professional manner, he comes at this is being neither a believer nor a debunker, I like that in this fellow! Cheerio!"
2,Didn't meet my expectations,"This book didn't meet my expectations. 75% of the time, the author tried to tell us that the phenomena is true through some of his personal (non-scientific) experiences. I wish he would have rather explained the scientific reasoning behind it and left to us, the readers, to come to any conclusions. The only chapter I liked was the mathematics behind the crop circles. I am disappointed with the book."
5,Study bible review,"I was given one of these bibles in ""Spanish"" by a friend when I first became a Christian. I like it very much, so when the time came for me to donate some bibles to a prison ministry. I decided to give them this bible. They wrote me back and they just love using it because they are learning quite a lot about Jesus Christ.Me regalaron una de estas biblias cuando yo me hice cristiana, y me encanto mucho. Que cuando vino el tiempo de donar unas biblias para un ministerio de la prision, yo pude regalarles de esta biblia. Los hermanos que recivieron las biblias estan aprendiendo mucho sobre Jesucristo."
3,Overview format,"This book is a nice supliment if you are planning a trip to the Temagami region in Canada, but the maps are not greatly detailed. Plan on buying another map of the region. I did take a 6 day trip from Wanapitei Lake then north all the way to Stouffer Lake. It is a beautiful route that is in the book. Sudbury Aviation picked us up at the end of the week and Lakeland Lodge was a fantastic base camp."
2,Not so good as I thought....,"I first bit into one..... ewwwwww, not so good, was my reaction!! I assumed they would be quite tasty, reading the other reviews, and Asian people usually always have good food, but in my opinion, these were not good. They stink when you first open the bag, and the taste isn't so yummy at all. They aren't disgusting, but they just aren't good or delicious. Disappointed."
4,I was suprised,"I was suprised I liked this album still. I mean come on I'm 16 and I love the Backstreet Boys. This album had a nice blend of everything from love songs to songs about cheating. My all time faves had to be Drowning, Show Me The Meaning, and The Call. My least faves were Shape of My Heart,Get Down, and Larger Than Life. I would say if you're a BSB hardcore fan you'll love this cd.1.""I Want it That Way""-4/52.""Backstreets Back""-2/53.""As Long As You Love Me""-5/54.""Show Me The Meaning of Being Lonely""-5/55.Quite Playing Games With My Heart""-4/56.""All I Have To Give""-3/57.""Larger Than Life""-1/58.""I'll Never Break Your Heart""-3/59.""The Call""-5/510.""Shape of My Heart""-3/511.""Get Down""-1/512.""I'd Go Anywhere for You""-5/513.""The One""-5/514.""More Than That""-3/515.""Drowning""-5/516.""The Perfect Fan""-5/5Penny Lane"
5,Gotta love 'em!,"It is hard to admit that I love the Backstreet Boys even though I am in my thirties but I do! You have to give them credit for consistently putting out bestselling songs and cds.This one is simply a collection of their best. All of the goodies from the beginning of their career to the latest. Even ""More Than That"" off of the latest cd is included. I love the mixture of ballads and hip-hop pop!This one is a true treat for fans!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This cd is a waste of money (i got it as a christmas gift). The only new song is Drowning. If you already own the first three CD's then just download Drowning. If you don't have the other cd's then i suggest you buy Black and Blue instead of this. This cd has alot of songs formt he first cd which all just mmush together, so yeah black in blue is the way to go if u don't have a cd. if you have all the cd's just download teh one song."
5,i love the backstreet boys!!!,all these songs are really great and i adore the backstreet boys with all my heart .
1,For Fans Only...,"Fortunatly I am not a fan. This album features all their hits and a song that was supposed to be on the album ""Black and Blue"". This album released October of 2001 debuted at 4 and only sold 1 million and the song ""Drowning"" which was supposed to be a cut for ""Black and Blue"" only hit 36. The future looks cloudy for the Backstreet Boys due to the fact I have heard nothing about any new releases nor that the group is still together. Otherwise this album is a good retrospective of their career of the late 1990s and early 2000s and will be good for nostalgic value when going into the future."
1,"let their music die, for the love of all that's decent.","as i write this review, this album has an average rating of four stars. there are two possibilities as to the future of this rating.1.as the months pass, it will steadily slide lower and lower, as the preteen girls of 1999-2002 get their hormones under control, post 1 star reviews to atoll for their musical sins, and start living meaningful musical lives.2.it will stay the same, as the preteen girls of 1999-2002 get their hormones under control, forget the backstreet boys ever existed, and start living meaningful musical lives.which ever of these events happens, for the sake of the integrity of western music, it had better happen soon. lets all join hands, concentrate real hard, and make it happen. we can do it if we try."
5,this backstreet boys cd rocks. you should go out and buy it.,"i love this backstreet boys cd you should go and buy this cd. i have been a fan of backstreet boys forever they rock!!!!!!!!! fan, rosie calahorrano"
1,Pathetic,"Okay, I'm all for Greatest Hits CD's but hello? BSB, you've only been around for like 4 years! You only have 3 freakin CD's!!!!! This is one more *pathetic* attempt to cash in before N sync totally takes over the pop throne. After they relesed the mega hit you released the maudlin Black and Blue. And now after the hit Celebrity you can't even crank out another dumb (at least new) CD? Get this: Your OVER!!"
5,AJ's FLOATING FACIAL HAIR MAKES ME WANNA LICK HIM,"this cd is the greatest to quote the smashing pumpkins song with a few words changed (oh how i make myself laugh like no other) but there is something i like more than laughing and that is AJ's facial hair its absolutely gorgeous to say the least, it really does make me wanna lick him.Oh and nick carter's bod is so so fine, so so fine i lost my mind."
3,2.5 stars,"okay then, why not just call it the last chapter of their career. I never screamed or fainted over these boys, all their songs sound the same and they are far from real artists. But the releases from millenium were really nice, especially Show Me the Meaning Of Being Lonely and I Want It That Way. The boy band craze is long over and you don't hear hits anymore from all these guys like n sync and 98 degrees either, you just hear about bizzare behavior and brush ins with the law"
5,I give it five stars.,Of Course they are going to come out with a greatest hits album. I hope they dont break up.LISA
1,i wish i could rate this 0-,"Chapter One: Ok, I agree that the BSB boys have been rolling…bumpily, but this last CD, it (...). All it is is all of the old “hit” songs and one new song. They've lost their touch. All they could come up with was one song, so they had to put some other songs there. Pathetic. (...)"
1,come ON NOW!!!,"how anybody considers anything by this or any other group like this music is beyond me. wake the hell up people. this is proof that anybody who walks out of the old navy store or abercrombie n fitch can be a pop icon. they don't play instruments, they don't even write their own music. these ""guys"" (i use that term loosely) are the reason why MTV still exists. that's enough to make me hope they rot. if you're into manufactured feelings, theni guess this is for you. ""like, WOW!"""
2,Greatest Hits?,"Though some of the songs are pretty good, I dont think it made much sense to release a greatest hits album yet, even though they have been out for years, its only been 3 albums. I think legends should have greatest hits albums, not just a group that just compiles all their singles onto one and calls it their greatest hits!"
5,a great CD,A compilation of the beautiful ballads and up-tempo mixes that made us fall in love with them. Its a must have for every Backstreet fan or someone who just wants a CD full of nothing but great music.
5,Excellent First Chapter,"This album is EXCELLENT! I am very happy that I purchased it. It contains all their hits. The one low point is the one new song on the album, Drowning. This is not a very good song, but the rest of the songs make up for it. You may have their previous albums, but it is nice to have all of these fab songs on one CD. If you don't have their previous albums, buy this and you will have the best of the Backstreet Boys."
1,Not what I expected,I thought I was purchasing BSB Greatest Hits: Chapter 1 on vinyl but it ended up containing 2 songs per side of remixes. I'd return it but it'll probably cost me more than it's worth.
2,The 90's were an odd time indeed...,"The 1990's... They began with ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and Nirvana, and ended with ""I Want It That Way"" and The Backstreet Boys. In other words, it went from smelling like teen spirit to actual teen spirit. Even though they pretty much defined the 2nd half of the 90's, BSB were still a horrible, horrible pop group. They had catchy songs and some good harmonies, but none of them were musicians or even writers. All their music was backed heavily by synthesizers, and if there was an acoustic guitar in there it was played by somebody else. The lyrics were not written by the boys themselves, but by a hired team or writers. Not to mention every song was about either A. love or B. dancing. What a range of topics, eh? Get this if you want some 90's nostalgia or a good laugh (at how cheesy these guys were). If you want a real 90's nostalgia CD, get Nirvana's Greatest Hits."
2,Wait!,"They are all good songs, but you've heard them before! - a lot! And if you liked 'em back then, you probably already got 'em.The new single Drowning is amazing, but thats really it. Even though im not a Backstreet fan I went out and bought the song. Well worth the money. Thats more than I can say about the album! Buy the next studio album instead, and save your dollars for something nice! Its christmas-time!"
2,The Hits--Chapter One,"Really only liked a few songs, but, I'm from an ""older"" generation and do not readily identify with all their music. Not their fault."
5,Good Collection,"This is great gift for someone who may not have the money to buy every single individual CD. Has a great selection of songs from each album, included their last one. Now, if only they would go on tour again!"
1,it's BSB,"What is there to say, it's Backstreet Boys. It's the same garbage over again, and i'm sorry i wasted my money. They say they reinvent themselves but we have yet to see that. i highly advize you all to run the other way from this album."
1,WHERE IS THE TALENT THESE DAYS ?,"The music world is in a sad state of affairs when a boring untalented group of whiney boys have a greatest ""hits"" album. Young people should be exposed to talented artists of yester-year who actually had talent. Maybe then ; future performers will produce inspiring music that will live in the hearts of future generations.This sort of ""music"" is pathetic."
1,don't waste your money,"as if we weren't sick enough of all their stupid sappy songs which basically state the exact same thing over and over again, they come out with a cd FULL OF THEM so we can all be driven crazy by their annoyingness. every single darn song on this cd has been overplayed to the point where you think your head just might explode if you hear it again. clearly the backstreet [boys] are losing their touch, if they ever had one, because this is a sad excuse for a ""new"" album. sorry guys, but id rather clean the toilet then listen to ""i want it that way"" one more time. don't waste your money on this piece of garbage unless you have literally no life and nothing to do but rot your brains with repeteive annoying teeny bopper loser mosic. maybe instead, you could listen to bands who are popular because they can actually sing and play instruments instead of just looking good. imagine that!"
1,HOw about a band has to actually be good to havea hits cd?,How can you even have a hits cd considering they had no decent music or hits to begin with? I listened to the entire cd and couldnt find a single song worth listening to for more than 8 seconds. This CD is full of horrible songs and now i have to have surgery to stop my ears from bleeding.
1,Worst Thing since New Kids On The Block,"I hate, im sorry DESPISE this sorry worthless pretentious ""music"" If I had it my way, those little men who claim to be musicians would go out and become poor hobos."
1,"Very Unnecessary ""Greatest Hits"" Album","The backstreet boys are over, and they probably thought ""well, we have a couple months left until we are gone. Lets put out a greatest hits compilation to cash out on a new album while we can, and call it ""Chapter One"" to fool them that there actually will be a volume 2."" I dont really see the point to this album. Every little girl that listens to this most likely already has every one of their albums. Plus the new song ""Drowning""? Sounds even worse than ""Shape of my Heart"". I mean how many times can they repeat the same type song? And apparently its getting a moderate amount of airplay. Thank goodness this will probably be their last top 40 single before they break up. I'm not a fan of the backstreet boys, but if i were to release a greatest hits album, i would include at least 2 new songs. And it looks like its not a very hot seller- even their last flop, ""black and blue"", sold 8 times more its first week."
1,Don't be fooled!,This software is great for creating screen savers but has very little compression ratio that makes the screen savers almost impossible to send to famliy and friends.DO NOT buy this software if you plan to share your creations. It does have Technical Support provided....but all that they could recommend to help fix the compression ratio was to buy there lastest version.
4,cute shoes but too big,"I first ordered this shoes in size 7M which is the size I normally wear with any other brand shoes but for some reason, 7M was too big for me so I had to give my shoes away to my sis. I reordered a size 6 1/2M but it's still too loose for me...I think I need to go for a size 6...I've never worn size 6 ever before but with this pair of shoes, I guess I'll have to go down one whole size. They are soo cute! I wish they had more colors!"
2,"im watching the mask right now. prove me wrong, muttonhead",eh. couple of the songs were ok. dont remember which. only listened to the cd once...right when i got it. nothing to write home about
1,Insult to the Black Sabs,"This is a terrible album, which serves only to insult the great Black Sabbath. If this album were broadcast to a wider audience, Bud E Luv would be hunted down and killed by people who understand the true essence of music. These songs represented the dawn of heavy metal and have influenced all music, even today's music. Bud E Luv has twisted the music so that it holds no bearing to the greatness that Ozzy, Tony, Geezer, and Bill made it to be.Instead, buy Black Sabbath."
1,Be careful on sizing,"I ordered a XL size. It is advertised as men""s sizing but I received a Youth size Xl. It won""t go past my hipsThe quality seems good but pay attention once you put it in your cart and make sure it is what is advertised. I will just freecycle since it was pretty cheap but sure wish I had the sweatshirt I ordered without the hassle of returns."
4,Thin but good for layering.,"The orange is not as bright as I thought it would be. Not bad. Good enough for my jobsite.The material is thinner than I thought it would be, but it's alright for layering, and feels nicer to wear than a safety vest."
1,Unremarkable,"As the ideal Chopin biography has yet to appear, I had high hopes for this book. But it looks as if Chopin fans are going to have to wait a while longer, because this one is unremarkable in every way. What appears to be a good idea in principle - a concise biography of Chopin's 18 years in Paris - breaks down due to Tad Szulc's complete inability to focus on any concept or topic.Szulc is an inept writer. His sentence structures are terrible. He seems to have nothing to say, and all day to say it. When the well really runs dry, he has a way of breaking off into obtuse generalities: ""He must have been guided by destiny."" I was unable to decipher so many of his ideas, sentences, and phrases that I wound up skimming the last 200 pages of the book. I read stacks of books -mostly about music- and this is the first book in years I've been unable to finish.Approach at your own risk. Me, I'll keep hoping for that elusive, comprehensive Chopin biography."
3,Where was the editor?,"The good stuff: Good history of Chopin and his life in Paris society. I especially liked how information about specific music pieces was woven into the biography. While the background on George Sand was a little long-winded, I enjoyed reading it nevertheless. In all, this biography brought Chopin to life for me and strengthened my interest in his music.The bad stuff: The author did not always present Chopin's life history in a sensical order - too much jumping back and forth making it somewhat difficult to follow. On many occassions I read a complete sentence or paragraph that had already been included in a previous chapter. Too much repetition - How many times can we be told how sickly Chopin was? We get it already! And the final clincher - Chopin was once referred to as ""Chop in"". Where was the editor?"
3,A fascinating story thats gets bogged down in details,"Szulc has written a deeply researched book that is great for the first third then starts to get hopelessly bogged down with minutia as he gets into an extended ""he said, she said"" over Chopin's relationship with George Sand. What starts out with promise ends up more a reference book than an engaging story."
4,good book on his life and love: music and George Sand,This book is a great read for anyone interested in learning more about Chopin and his love for music. You also get to learn about his love interest in George Sand. Szulc does a great job of keeping the material interesting as Chopin's contributions for all of time.This is a great book to have for anyone that loves Chopin!
2,"Well, it was only $20...","But I am horribly disappointed in it. I bought this lamp to go in my office to avoid the flourescent lights. It has lasted about 1.5 yrs. However, the light bulb blew out in it and now it no longer works by touch sensor and you have to unplug it to turn it off. That sucks. It only works on the lowest of the 3-way settings and my 100 watt light bulb is too dim for even my small office. I feel like this was pretty much a waste of money. For all the headaches, I would have bought something a tad more expensive, but more reliable. FYI, Garden Ridge has some nice cheap lamps."
2,Touch sensor fails,"I bought three of these lamps because they looked great and had the touch sensor which I thought was a cool feature. The light bulb in one of them blew one day and the apparently the touch sensor blew with it. A few months later the next one blew and so did the touch sensor. The final one recently blew. The touch sensors are incredibly sensitive to blowing when the light bulb blows. I have to unplug them now to turn them off. At least I have a wall switch on one of them so it works like a regular light switch. Beware purchasing this lamp because it will not last you very long. However, they do illuminate a room very well."
1,Junk. Plain and simple.,So..... $20 for 10 minutes of operation? I don't think so. I can't believe they even sell this thing at Target when the reviews are so poor on Amazon. Don't waste your money! The sensor on this thing will take on a life of its own before you even throw out the box. You've been warned...
1,Terrible,"This lab was a horrid item. It only worked on select outlets in my house. I found myself touching it several times to have turn on and then immediately off! This lab is terrible, definately skip it!"
1,Unreliable! Would NEVER recommend!,"So this lamp was used in the basement for the kids. I wanted a floor lamp that my 8 year old could turn on without having to reach a switch. From the beginning, the kids were scared of this thing. It would turn on in the middle of the night. All the time. I did some research and found that to be a common problem with these lamps. So I brought it upstairs. Now it won't even stay on. It worked right before I brought it up.... well it came on and stayed on, anyway.... now it doesn't even stay on. I give up. It has done NOTHING for me."
1,Poor reliability,I've now gone through two of these suckers. The touch sensor worked properly with a standard 3way light bulb with a max of 150 watts. The power dimmer that changes to the three different brightness levels is horrendously unreliable.The first one I had fried itself out of existence within the first hour of use. The second one happily lasted about 3 months and then decided to just let go... don't buy this expecting it to last.
1,This lamp hates me and is evil,"I bought this lamp from Target about four months ago. From the beginning, it would turn on and off at odd times, but it would behave most of the time. The last couple of weeks it started just turning off, and I couldn't get it to go back on unless I switched it to a new outlet. I'd get it settled in its new location, then it would turn off again. But did I give up? No. I moved it again. Then instead of suddenly shutting off, it slowly faded out. I changed the bulb. It worked! Then it turned off. As embarrassing as it is to admit, yes, I once again moved my furniture around so I could crawl behind to plug it into yet another outlet. Success! Then defeat, as it slowly faded to nothing. Finally I checked the Internet and discovered other people's similar problems. I've been chasing this lamp around my living room for four months and it's pretty much just been flipping me off. It is evil, and it will be in the trash tomorrow."
4,Won't work with compact flourescents,"This lamp is fine, but I had to remove the touch controller in order to use it with a 26w CFL light bulb. If you get this lamp, plan on using a high-wattage incandescant bulb, or getting an electrician to unwire the touch controller."
4,"Works great until it doesn't want to, sometimes","Sometimes you will see that this lamp doesn't want to turn on or off, don't worry, it's not broken! Just keep tapping it, and make sure no wires or TV or anything else is touching it that runs electricity. Very cool lamp, brighten up my room!! Pun intended."
2,Poor lamp,"I purchased one of these lamps in hopes it would work as a normal lamp in my living room. My first mistake was purchasing a CFL 3-way bulb for it. The lamp worked for awhile but would randomly turn itself on and off. I did some research online and found out that touch lamps can be sensitive to static electricity or interference from devices. I moved the lamp. Still, it turned itself off. FInally, I realized it was the CFL light bulb. So I put in a standard 3 way GE incandescent bulb. The lamp worked for many months without a problem. Today, the bulb burned out and tripped my circuit breaker leaving me in darkness.The other problem I have is that one of my cats figured out he could turn the lamp on and off by touching it. So if you have children, pets or wish to use an energy efficient bulb, this lamp is not for you."
1,it was nice until it stopped working two hours later,"Purchased this lamp from target through Amazon. Assembled the lamp, plugged it in, and enjoyed it for an hour or so. Turned off the lamp went away came back, and turned the lamp back on. After about 30 mins; It started to flicker, and finally went out. I figured it was a bad bulb. After testing 8 bulbs in this lamp, and another working lamp (which all the bulbs worked fine in. Found out that this lamp was defective. Sent it back and was refunded. However was still a waste of time.The lamp build is made sturdy. The light cover isn't frosted glass, but an opaque plastic. However issues that myself, and others have had with this lamp seem to be in the electric system of the lamp. Could be something simple as wire not soldered tight enough at the factory"
1,would NOT reccomend,I bought this lamp from target about a year or so ago. The touch part worked fine until the light bulb went out and I have not been able to get the touch part of it to work since. I am glad to see others have had the same problem and it was not just me.
5,Simply outstanding!,"One of the best Batman stories I ever read. The artwork is gorgeous! I particularly like the depiction and characterization of Bruce Wayne. Typically, Bruce isn't very memorable in any given story. He's just a generically handsome placeholder until he puts on the suit and ""becomes"" Batman. Here, he's strikingly good looking (the receding hair at his temples was a nice touch)and very much a dynamic, charismatic gentleman. The Jack the Ripper mystery which forms the heart of the story is interesting and entertaining, though the surprise ending didn't surprise me as much as the writers, perhaps, hoped it would. Overall, an outstanding effort."
3,Interesting,"The first of the Elseworlds books. At first look, this book is a real eye-catcher. The trade ads say that Jack the Ripper has finally met someone more terrifying than he is. That's only what it says. The book just doesn't capture the feel of better Batman comics like The Dark Knight Returns and Year One. Mike Mignola's version of the Batman may be one of the most popular but in this book, he just kind of failed to make Batman feel terrifying and intimidating. The story was kind of predictable. The setting of the story does make it interesting as it's not an approach tried on superheroes before. Taking a well known character and change the circumstances surrounding him. Because of that, it makes you wonder if you apply the same thing to other DC characters."
2,Predictable and dull,"Really baffled as to what all the fuss about. The underlying concept is great: Batman in the 19th century versus Jack the Ripper. This really should work; Batman fits in perfectly into a typical dark, squalid Victorian-era city with its Gothic architecture. Unfortunately the execution is poor; the story lacks any real depth or excitement and the identity of the Ripper is incredibly obvious. It's all over too quickly, and I think that's the problem. For this experiment to work, to create a believeable alternate world for Batman as well as strong characterisation and plot development, it really needs to be much longer."
2,Wasted potential,"Gotham at the turn of the century, the steam era, that great cover- it looks awesome, doesn't? The idea is great. It starts off great. But the story seems to loose track of itself and fall from what it could have been to an awkward attempt to push a Jack the Ripper mystery into the Batman backstory. The art was attractive and fitting, and there were definite little highlights sprinkled about but on a whole, I can't recommend this book."
2,A Letdown,"The premise for Gotham by Gaslight was so really intriguing, so I was pretty excited to read it. That excitement pretty much evaporated after about the first two or three pages. The artwork was really bland and the dialogue was very forgettable. The plot was so obvious that anyone with half a brain could have figured out exactly what was going to happen after about the first five pages. Another flaw I found was that it was too short for any of the characters to develop whatsoever. To sum up, great premise, very poor execution."
2,eh,I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this. The story is slow paced and fairly anti-climactic. The art is interesting but nothing special.
1,Don't waste your money - poor quality compilation,This is one of the worst compilations I have ever bought. It is quite boring except for Nicola Conte's Bossa Per Due. I bought it cheap and should have known - its quality is commensurate with what I paid for it.I would recommend any of the following instead:ESL Soundtracks - Modular SystemsJunkie XL - Radio JXL: A Broadcast From the Computer Hell CabinThievery Corporation - The Richest Man in Babylon
5,Excellent Chill Out CD,"This is the best Chill Out CD I have found. If you are like me and like a good background for after a night at the club or for an evening in, this this is for you. Check out Sail - Aim and Fingerprints - Liquid Syndicate."
4,A good companion to typical text-book approaches.,"For people who need to get things done quickly using JavaScript, this book can be extremely helpful. It is best used as a reference text in conjunction with other lower-level handbooks. Unless you have some programming experience, I would not recommend this book as a tutorial or introduction to JavaScript, but it is a valuable source of many effective techniques that can shorten your development time."
2,Attention: cd1 and cd2 are the same !,"Very good rock band from Chile... But, EMI have done an error with this antologia, because CD1 and CD2 ( with different color and marked CD1 and CD2) have the same content, the content of CD2... what a shame! So at the end, i've downloaded (illegaly!) the tracks from CD1. Now i can understand why a big company like EMI have so many problems, and why lot of people prefer to download mp3 ...And i can't send it back to amazon.com, because from France to USA, it's to expensive!"
2,Too Short's Worst Album,"Two albums ago, Too Short released ""Can't Stay Away,"" an imbalanced album featuring around 18 unknown and amatuer rappers and recycled beats. ""Chase the Cat""has similar problems, but it's much worse. Seventeen tracks on this album feature alot of filler along with atleast nineteen different rappers. *Nineteen.* The guest rappers dominate, and Too Short is little more than a footnote on his own album. Overall, the album features only four or five listenable songs.Fans of course remember a time when Too Short made albums for himself and by himself. The idea of a guest appearance on album was truly an exception, and when it did occur, it was an established rapper appearing. Now anyone off the street can get a record deal, and Too Short is more than happy to crowd the studio with no names and crank out another album. Short's focus is no longer rap music, but pure commercialism. Save your money."
3,When Is This Guy Going To Stop!,"This cd isn't all that great he only has a couple of good songs such as ""I Luv""&""Chase The Cat"" and ""Don't give up"" these are the only good songs on the cd and they are good to bump the bass and hi's are all great Too $hort comes out with the cleanest songs to bump! I suggest you just download them from Kazaa."
1,Too Short's #1 Fan,"I like ""I Luv"" and another song... Thats it and I have everything by Too Short. It might be time to RETIRE!"
2,SHORT'S WORST ALBUM,"This album is just terrible. I paid...for a TOO SHORT album, not for a bunch of sucker MC losers rapping while Too Short just sings the chorus. I guess Short thinks that he can't sell albums on his own anymore?? Oh, and the beats on this disc are about as funky as a golf tournament. I can't belive Ant Banks layed this junk down. Maybe it's a misprint??I'm a die-hard Too Short fan, and that's why I'm giving this album two stars instead of one. But this is the last album of Short's that I'll ever buy. He just doesn't have it anymore."
2,Messed with the formula,"You can save your money with this one...I'm a huge $hort fan and I love his style...usually. On this album his vocals are weak, the raps aren't as tight and the songs just really aren't that catchy. I have tried to give this album a chance on many occasions but I just can't get into it.For his later stuff I prefer his style more in the way of ""you nasty"" or ""can't stay away"". I'm looking for tight, funky loops with in your face lyrics. This album has neither."
3,Chasing The Cat,"It's An Alright CD If You Like To Roll Around. The Only Good Song On This CD Is ""I Luv"". It's Also Alright To Chill Back and Just Jam."
1,It claims to be stainless steel but it rusted immediately!,"The metal part that holds the brush says it is stainless steel. After a very short time, it was rusted and corroded.I won't buy this brush again."
1,Amazon Sends the Incorrect Item. 06067P is what I ordered!,I ordered this item on Amazon.com as its description states Model # 06067P which is the BRASS bristle model. Amazon sent me 06067SSP which is the stainless steal bristles. I called to let them know of this mixup. We'll see if I get the correct one.
1,Beware of wire coming off !!!,I ordered this brush and after a short time using it the wires started to come off and get on my grill grates. They are very small and when it happened I didn't notice it. I cooked some chicken breast and put on the table for dinner. My son was eating one and bit into a peace of wire. I had to really look close at the wire until I figured out that it was coming from this grill brush. I never had this happen to any other grill brush I have used. I would tell everyone to find a better brush than this one.
3,Nice item but not exactly what it says,"These brushes are very sturdy and heavy -- but the bristles are stainless steel, not brass."
5,A grand-slam for any sports fan,"This book takes you deep inside baseball ownership and it's battle with the player's union. Each team is historically described as the author takes you into Union and owners meetings and negotiations. From Marvin Miller to the most recent work stoppage, you'll walk away understading not only baseballs labor disputes but the labor problems of all professional sports."
2,Not worth the time,"This book is interspersed with some good stories of players and other key movers and shakers in baseball. However, the book did not live up to the title. If labor relations is your interest, this would be an good book. If you are a baseball history buff interested in the players, don't waste your time with this one. This book will be one you have to force your way through."
2,"I knew it would notbe new, but ancient?","I knew the book would be old, but it was in worse condition than I expected. In all fairness, I didn't pay much for it. But I've bought other used books through Amazon.com for less than $5.00. This was the worse. I've not yet tried to read it but in leafing through it there are many pages folded to half the page size. I'm going to try and get the book through our local library."
5,Truly insightful,"If you want to know about baseball, this is the one book you MUST read. From the early days of robber-baron owners, to the formation of the most powerful union in the world, this book tells it all in great detail. I cannot recommend it enough to fans of the game as well as anyone interested in the history of business in America. It has been said that to know the history of America, you must know the history of baseball. This book exemplifies that thought. Its out of print, but try as hard as you can to find a copy. You will not be dissapointed."
1,Kindle Edition,"Be aware! The Kindle version of this book is only Second edition. There is already a 5th edition in print. Stick with the print version until the publisher releases the current edition on Kindle.The Complete Idiot's Guide to Organizing Your Life, 5th Edition"
5,Great Book,This book has many great suggestions for all areas of your life. I was raving to my sister and she wanted to borrow the book but I wasn't done yet. She was calling me to send her a tip every few days... I decided it was worth it to buy her a copy. She loves it too.
2,dissapointed...,ive read over 10 guides in this vien. this one's an overall dry read. i know my review's harsh but its the truth.
1,HOKEY,"I found this on my bookshelf and thought, ""Gosh, I don't remember why I never finished this book."" Now I know why. If the following passage appeals to you, you'll like the whole book. I hate schamltz, so I found it hokey (if my husband said phrases like this, I'd have to retch):""Sunlight is the only makeup that should ever touch your face -- only the wind should brush your hair.""Seems like something only a lounge lizard would say. The whole book is hokey and doesn't really have much substance. It is a romance (which is not my favorite genre), but I thought it would also be a true mystery story, expecially since I'm fascinated by the concept of lucid dreaming. The aura of a mystery was 'kind of' there, but not enough of a mystery story for me.If you've ever attended the UW in Seattle, you will get a kick out of his description of the campus gardens near the forestry and botany buildings (that was the bright spot of the book). That portion was enjoyable."
4,Predictable But Pleasant,"Reynolds uses a panoramic camera for the views in this book. Whether one cares for this sort of photo with itsunconventional proportions may be a matter of taste. The subjects represented are fairly conventional for this sort of picture book, and several similar volumes about the Finger Lakes are available. Little textual information is provided. On the other hand, Reynolds is a photographer of the first rank, with a good eye and technical command of the medium. The book is handsome. For this reader, it is less rewarding, however, than his subsequent ""Wine Tour of the Finger Lakes,"" where the pictorial subjects are less predictable, while the informative text by Grady Wells makes the content more substantive. That one is a full five stars!"
2,Nothing new...,"LFO is something you listen to a couple times,then it gathers dust in a corner. They have same old tunes,with same old lirics just like all the pop sensations of these days. Nothing new I'd say. The song ""Summer Girls"" is pretty much just a promotion for Abercrombie& Fitch clothes. I say that because once that song was on the raido,BOOM(!) all the ""cool kids"" were waring A&F clothes. ""Girl on T.V."" is a slow moving tune and the girl on t.v. they're talkin' about is Jennifer Love Herwitt. They will have the same fate as the Spice Girls(if they even have another cd that would be pure luck). Unless the same stupid rap lirics repeating over and over with barly any singing set to a (yawn) slow melody, is your type of music, I'd advise just listening to it on the raido. Enough said"
1,Worthless,"If I could give this book zero stars I would. I was looking foward to a good read - something funny, clever. The book was none of these, nor was it educational, insightful, humorous or even mildly entertaining. A complete waste of time. My congratulations to the author and his publicist however, for getting me to buy the book."
3,Handbook for the Put Upon,"This is the book you take with you to kill time in waiting rooms. Or keep in the bathroom. Nothing important, but fun to read. Almost everyone will be inspired to use one or more of these devilish methods of fighting back at life's little annoyances."
3,Worth Reading,I remember when the front page piece in the NYT first came out by the same author. It circulated endlessly on the net. This book upped the ante in that it gave a closer sense of how people respond to the little gripes of daily existence.
2,This is one of the annoyances!,"There's about two laughs in this whole book, and they are only chuckles. Most of the great ideas people have for ""getting back"" at people who annoy them are childish and many admit that they have exacted no results at all from their little private wars with the ignorant,intolerant and uncaring.This book only takes about an hour to read and sadly- it's a wasted hour. I got it as a gift and decided to donate it instead of re-gifting because I didn't want to annoy anyone else!"
1,"BE FOREWARNED - THIS IS AN ABSTRACT, NOT A REAL BOOK","This is a summary of a book, not a real book. It costs $1/page, and is not worth it."
5,This book says it all,"From the get-go, the book sets the stage - you only lose sales to the next best alternative by being outsold. Everything else is an excuse.Having read several books on the topic of sales strategy, as well as taking training on the subject, this book really nicely summarizes everything I've seen covered on the topic of strategy (and then some).Highly recommended."
3,no nonsense book on getting the best return on effort while selling,* clearly explains selling form the salesman point of view* no nonsense book on getting the best return on effort while selling
2,"Too many stories, too few principles","Based on the reviews, I thought this would be a great book. But the author crafts too many exacting stories and not enough principles. If you're ever in exactly the same situations the author describes, you're OK. Normally, my hiliters work hard when I read books. Not this time. I'd suggest reading Strategic Selling and Spin Selling instead."
3,X-mas gift for co-worker,"My co-worker is a huge Bears fan. I thought he would appreciate the gift set for the holidays. It has been a little over six months since he has received the gift set, and yet no words of gratitude have made my way. This may not mean he does not like the gift, but he is someone to brag about items he enjoys and I have yet to hear enthusiasm of his usage. I'm not a golfer, so I do not know if the quality of the gift is useful. If you are looking for something to show you pay attention and know what the person likes (i.e. Bears and golfing) then I say this is a great gift. If you want to give something based on quality, I am no help."
5,Good health and Well Being AT LAST!,"Wiley and co-authors research was so far ahead of our times in 2001 but thank goodness the natural plant hormones are available for us today! Look further into this factual, yet amusing study, with a tremendous reference section and discover that artery blockage is caused by SUGAR after all these years of cholesterol lowering pills which affects our liver and many other facts relating to birth control pills and cancer. All women, neutered or not, will greatly benefit from reading this book and running to their nearest compounding pharmacy to start this natural hormone replacement. A feeling of well-being and subtle muscle and bone changes will also take place. I no longer have to take pills for arthritis! Thank you Wiley and doctors!"
5,"Sex, Lies, and Menopause","This is information that every womsn should have, not just middle aged women. The book helps you to understand the importance that reproduction and nursing has on our future health and in the prevention of breast and other cancers. It also expains why natural estrogen and progesterone are needed our whole lives. This book could save your life!"
1,Poorly done,"While purporting to expose ""the shocking truth about hormone replacement therapy,"" Sex, Lies, and Menopause is poorly written, even incoherent at times, and only adds to the confusion about HRT. The book is poorly researched, hard to read and contains glaring inaccuracies. In short, I found this book a real disappointment, especially during such a trying time in a woman's life."
1,One for the Alternative Medicine Hall of Shame,"As a physician, I can tell you that Wiley's logic is poor, that her references to the scientific literature are often incorrect, and that she makes completely unfounded assumptions as to the safety of her method.Further, I have treated about ten women who tried the Wiley protocol through other physicians and found it, after a few months, to be worse than useless.This woman presents herself quite dangerously as a medical authority. Do not take this book seriously."
2,Not worth the money....,"Potential buyers should be aware that, of the 398 pages in the hardcover edition, 144 pages are reference notes, glossary and index. The price should be half of what the publisher is asking."
3,Original music...YES!,This CD is not a cheap remake of horror movie music. These are the original recordings from the movie soundtracks. The recordings are top notch! Since I was looking for scary sound effects for an introduction...it was perfect! As far as the listenability of the disc goes...it is not something to put in your CD changer at a party. The Alien soundtracks are more like weird noise than music (not to say they aren't cool).
4,Well worth it for overture alone,"The overture, as a musical form, began life as the prelude to an opera or ballet. And many totally forgotten operas stay alive due to their overtures. Somewhere along the line, overtures became concert pieces of their own. Mendelssohn wrote many of them. Here we have one by Ibert which I found quite fascinating and enjoyable. It is in ABA form with a very long middle section. Nothing sad here, this is music of sheer joy. The rest of the CD has two Ibert masterpieces, one interesting dance work and a disaster, as noted by the previous reviewer. The performance of the overture and the dance work are excellent. The two masterpieces get respectable performances. As for the disaster, the performance does not really matter."
4,Great Fun,This is something that the whole family can enjoy. You do need to have a flat surface to use it. It is very hard to go up an incline. Everyone that comes over to our house has to try it. We bought two of them so that we can have races which is a lot of fun.
3,Kids Love It!,"The kids love their Turtle. My 5 year old enjoys riding it and it took my 2 year old a few days to figure it out. Only works on smooth flat surfaces, doesnt climb slopes. My 2 boys ride them mostly in our basement playroom and love it. Cant really use them outdoors where i live, pretty bummed out. These turtles are not cheap for the little amount of use we get out of them. If you had a big driveway they would be awesome!!!"
5,great old school outdoor toy,"this is a great outdoor toy...I ordered it for my daughter's 5th birthday and she loves it! My husband and I can ride it too. Great purchase and alternative to outdoor play. It will really fly down hill though, so be careful and ESPECIALLY not without shoes as there are no breaks....but it states this on the product."
3,So so,"Have this and several plasma cars. For whatever reason my kids seem to enjoy the plasma cars much better. Would I purchase another, probably not."
5,flying turtle,These are awesome toys. Even though my kids are now 9 & 10 they still enjoy them. They are easy to use and have held up great! Great exercise for the kids as well. Love this product.
1,did not get what i ordered,"I ordered a (purple) ""original flying turtle"" for my daughter. Instead I received a blue ""roller racer"". Immediately contacted the company by phone and was advised that the blue ""roller racer is the ""same"" as the ""original flying turtle"". The product is different not just by name, color and looks. But it is much harder to maneuver due to the handle bars being in a different position. I requested the correct product to be sent but was advised they do not carry the ""original flying turtle"". They also advised if I wanted a refund I must return the product and pay for shipping. I asked why they listed on amazon and the phone disconnected. Seriously!!"
2,Too much work to have fun...,I purchased this because when my kids were small they had one and loved it. It was fast and fun so I thought my grandchildren would love it. Although it looks the same it does not work as easily and is a real effort to get it moving. I had several different kids of different heights and weights try it but it just didn't work well. I was going to return it but didn't. It may just be the one I got but I don't think I would recommend it to any one since I assume it isn't defective but just the way they are made now.
1,flying turtles,I was very disappointed with this product. It was very uncomfortable to sit on. It did not go very fast. And you have to have a perfectly flat smooth surface for it to work well.
5,Turtle Fun,My grandsons love this toy. The turtle is sturdy and well-made. My daughters had the same thing in the 1980's and I am glad they are still around.
5,Fun for all kids,"The flying turtle is well constructed and made in the USA.My 8 year old 10 year daughters love it. I was worried that the older child wouldn't like but she does because she is kind of small for her age. It works great indoors on our basement concrete floor. It does not leave skid marks on the floor, even on our kitchen vinyl floor. I think kids as young as four would love this. It is a very unique thing to ride. I would only ride it on relatively flat, fairly smooth surfaces like driveways and sidewalks because you can't get it to move well on inclines. Adults like to watch the kids ride it. I am very pleased with it."
4,flying turtles,These are great toys! The kids have had a blast riding them and even my husband and I have taken a spin on them. :) The ONLY thing I could say that isn't so favorable is that they don't go as fast on our roughly paved road (we live on a cul-de-sac in the country and don't have sidewalks) but our driveway is a blast.
4,Awesome,"I got this as a gift for my stepdaughter for her birthday this month. We haven't given it to her yet, but my husband and I are having a great time with it!! I had one when I was a kid and it's still just as much fun"
5,coolest possible ride-on,"I am so excited about this turtle! I, a 32 year old mother, just received what will be a Christmas gift for my son (3 years old). It came fully assembled and ready to go right out of the box. I sat on it and started turning the handlebars and I was off! I could have ridden for hours - no joke! What a fun toy - may have to order one for myself...just to keep my son company, of course. Can't wait until we get to open it again at Christmas - if I can keep myself from riding it again in the meantime. A very sturdy and well-made toy!"
5,All around fun!!,"We first tried out a Flying Turtle at a neighborhood block party and our son fell in love with it. He quickly learned that HE could control how fast or slow he wanted to go. This is easily done by moving the handle bars back and forth. The Flying Turtle works on a number of smooth surfaces including hard wood floors (without a scratch or scuff on our floors), cement floors like basement or garage, black top driveway and sidewalks. You sit low enough to the ground so it is unlikely that a fall would hurt as much as falling off a bike. This is a toy that will grow with our son (I believe it holds up to 220lbs) so I won't need to replace it after growth spurts. It has improved our son's core strength and balance too. All around fun while getting great exercise!!"
4,Super fun inside,This is a great indoor scooter or on smooth surface like driveway or side walk. My kids enjoy this product (not as much as their bikes though). They played with it every day from Christmas until we brought it outside in the Spring and have not touched it since. I a going to just bring it back inside for the winter. The nice thing is it holds a lot of weight. I would race my kids around the house. They do have the Plasma Car which is similar and they like the Plasma Car better than this scooter.
4,Good,This is very fun! you can ride on hills it is a great arm work out but on carpet it is an even better one. The seat is really hard and after a day of riding it i am really sore
5,Flying turtle,This is an awesome product. I purchased 2 more as my kids were always fighting over the first one. They love them!
5,Loved it !,"If you love Palo De Mayo, you will love this cd. Being a Nica, I would recomend to get both Vol.1 and Vol. 2 to complete your collection. Vol. 2 defenately has a few great rare songs that you do not find anywhere else in any other Palo De Mayo cd. I've been looking for one song in particular that i could only find in this cd. Because the names of the songs are so hard to remember, many people don't know what they are missing. You defenately need to check these 2 cd's out. They should of called it ""The Best of Palo De Mayo"" because it truly is THE BEST!"
3,Want to sleep easy?,"This book has good info but the way its written makes it so drawn out, however she has great research."
4,DIANNO/ THE BEAST,"I was looking forward to reading this book as I was, and still am an early Iron Maiden fan. Loved Paul's account of living his crazed rock-n-roll life style with brutal honesty. Just a bit let down that Dianno did not go into deeper details of his solo career, having only touched upon various aspects while completly leaving out others(GOGMAGOG EP session's). I also wish he would have spent a little time describing the meanings behind his songs especially during his solo years. Overall thought the book was funny, brutaly honest, shocking. Its a great read and would recomend this book to anyone who loves to read rock -n-roll debauchery at it's finest. Paul is a beast and an Ace!!!"
1,What A Knob,"What a load of crap. This bloke should have been a pro boxer he is such a great fighter. Maybe his problem is that half of the people he has bashed are women. Even the people he gets to write some good words about him say that he is full of crap. He should get over the fact that he wasn't good enough to be in Iron Maiden and move on. He has lived on his past glories for way too long. As a long time metal fan, I have heard lots of stories about lots of metal stars. Yet I don't think I have heard of any of his self proclaimed famous and infamous stories that he writes about in this book.Only read if you are extremely bored. I only continued reading it because I could not believe how much of a goose this bloke really was and thought it would maybe get better. It didn't."
2,Dissapointed,"Very dissapointed in this book. I was hoping to find out more about the recording of the 1st two Iron Maiden albums. Now I know that the old saying goes ""If you don't have something nice to say don't say anything at all"" but Mr. Di'anno takes this to a new level. Aside from meeting Steve Harris about joining the band and drinking with Dave Murray nothing is said about the recording sessions or any shows.Mr. Di'anno mostly tells story after story of drunken sexual escapades. It gets quite boring after awhile."
5,"Paul Di'Anno ""The Beast""",It's not your normal biography that is for sure. Also if you think you know Paul Di'Anno better think again and read his book. It shows the highs in his career as well as the very low points and all the hellraisering in between. It really is a eye opener on some of his behavior both on and off stage. But overall a excellent read and well worth buying.
3,"Entertaining, yet redundant","I bought this book because I knew so little about Paul Di'Anno. What l learned -- he's a drunk/dope fiend with a rage problem and a large ego. He didn't delve into the Iron Maiden years enough, which was a mistake since that's the primary reason people know him. This book is so redundant .. same story, different city, different girl. It got real old, real quick.With that being said, the book was entertaining at times and listen to Di'Anno describe his sexual encounters makes you wonder if he writes Penthouse Letters or participates in cyber-sex frequently.LOUTS ... makes it all worthwhile. It's an abbreviation for a sexual escapade that makes the book worth reading."
5,A COMPELLING AND HONEST VIEW ON NEW CHRISTIANS,"This book isn't so much a sequel to ""My Mother's Keeper"" as it is about B.D. and Jeremy's new found faith. I found it engrossing and highly readable. Their faith is amazing and the stories of their miraculous healings are a true testament to that faith. This book may have gotten panned by critics and public because of their ""worship"" of Bette Davis, but ultimately, it is God who triumphs in the end. May God Bless the Hyman family for standing up for the truth and giving God all the Glory as they do in this fine book."
1,Could some real Christians step forward please,"So maybe Bette Davis had Narcissistic Personality Disorder and it seems that her daughter inheritat it. While Bette Davis turned her problems into great movies her daughter turned into a mediocre scam artist. She is claiming she 'found Jesus' and people should give money to her 'ministry'. Strangly she found Jesus pretty much the moment her mother cut her off finacially ( she and her husband had never supported themselves) the scam seems to work enough to support a semi-lavish lifestyle - all in the name of Jesus of course. Tacky, tacky, phoney! Could some real Christians step forward please and explain that Jesus wasn't about making money and spewing self-rightousness because it seems like some people are really confused on that issue. Yuck."
1,Narrow is the Mind,"This book is laugh out loud funny, but it is entirely unintentional. The Bette Davis book they wrote must have been a huge sensation; there is no other explanation for why this nonsense was published. The Hymans have to be the most self-serving couple on the planet. Too bad they reproduced; I fear for their children. These people are reprehensible, and they embody the exact opposite of Christ's teachings. I wonder if B.D. still believes one can be a good Christian even if they regularly skip church services for yachting & lobster expeditions now that she has her own ministry. These people are absolutely venal. That said, the book is a hoot for that very reason."
1,NARROW IS THE MIND----BORING IS THE BOOK,"Bette Davis' daughter explains that God made her write her vicious tell-all-and-embellish-freely book about her mother My Mother's Keeper. By trashing her own mother's name for millions she is doing God's work. She mocks gays, tells her son he's possessed by Satan, and generally claims God's authority for her own. Sadly, her frenzy is not able to energize the prose. Shame!"
1,What a couple of freaks...they deserve each other...,"Don't waste your money! This book is nothing but [junk] from beginning to end. Only in America could two pathetic losers such as these two actually find someone to publish their ridiculous story. On the other hand, their meal-ticket for years, the loveable Miss Bette Davis, is no longer alive to support their sorry butts. Guess they're getting desperate for money. I had to give it one star, but that was only because there wasn't a zero. Suggestion for B.D. and Jeremy: crawl back under that rock--you're scaring people!"
5,Great book very advanced,"Jean Jacques Machado with Kid Peligro Black Belt Techniques is a have a great book. The techniques are very advanced and have a lot of flow. The descriptions are crisp and thorough and present each situation and the variations of the situation and a few options of attacks.Thre are both Gi and no Gi techniques with most of them Gi but easily adaptable to No Gi.The pictures and presentation, like all Kid Peligro's books, are top notch. I especially liked the intro were Jean Jacques explains his thoughts on Jiu Jitsu and the way he trains and progresses.I recommend this book to everyone even beginenrs, so they can see what the future is and how to get there.GREAT JOB!"
3,"A cool book, seems a little unrealistic though...","Ok, I'm no Jiu Jitsu expert like JJ Machado, but after buying and reading this book i feel like...1.) in the words of another reviewer, alot of these moves will only work if you are A.) JJ Machado B.) Rolling with a complete beginner who has no knowledge of Jiu Jitsu.On the positive side, the book is very well put together in terms of organization, quality of photos, and descriptions. Alot of interesting ideas are presented and the book did broaden my perspective on things. That is, while I didnt find many moves that work for me in this book, it did help me to see things in a different way and incorporate that understanding into my game."
5,tartar remover,"IT WORKS REALLY WELL, I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT IT FILLS THE BILL. I USE IT ON MY DOGS :)"
3,scaler,"I received this item quickly, and it was as discribed. However, the blades were so dull that I was unable to use this scaler to clean my dog's teeth."
1,Great item - very bad shipping and handling!,"The Tartar Remover arrived at my home promptly. It is a great item, made with very superior metal and SHOULD work well, BUT, it arrived being bent 90 degrees. It is made of a very high grade stainless steel (medical grade) and is very sturdy. It must have taken a ""gorilla"" to stomp on it to bend it 90 degrees. How can this happen in ANY shipping/handling? It did not cost so much even with the shipping (about double the cost of the item) added, so it is not worth my time to return it, but, it left a bad feeling about Amazon in my stomach!"
2,It does the job,I purchased this item for personnal use. The quality is fair and it does the job. I will not do business with the vender as the shipping was rather slow and cost more than the item.
3,"Does its job, but low quality metal","When I received this item, I put it in the dishwasher to clean it before using it. When it came out, it had some rust on it. I was expecting a higher quality stainless steel than that, so I was disappointed. It's only in a small area and the scraper is fine otherwise."
3,Nice for Price,"The metal is good for the price, but it could be a little sharper. I would recommend it to a friend."
3,"needs sharper edge, but OK considering price","I use this little tool on my dog, on advice from my vet. However the edge it came with was too thick to fit into the areas needing cleaning, so I had it ground down, but the metal is not the best quality for that process. Overall though, I am able to use this tool effectively and for the price it is OK. Could spend much more on this type of tool, so I am happy to have this one, which does work with modification."
2,tartar remover,"Maybe I just can't figure out how to use it, but I can't get this thing to remove anything. My set of picks works so much better. Not recommended for do-it-yourself tartar removal."
3,Decent game,"Graphics look good overall. In some areas of the game and the in-game cut scenes, the textures can look somewhat freakish. If you enjoyed playing the previous Brothers in Arms games, you will enjoy this one. Gameplay is fun, the ability to use cover is a great addition."
4,Good Game,If you like Brothers in Arms other games you will also like this one.But what I like is that you get two new unit a Machines gun team and also a bazooka team it is a lot more fun.
3,"Alright game, a good holdover to the next Modern Warfare, etc","This game is alright, nothing spectacular and nothing super terrible. I mainly got this because it was on sale for Black Friday and it was a good filler between Modern Warfare games"
4,Very fun and well made with a few quarks.,"Overall, this is a very fun game with lots of special effects and action. The game has a good way of alerting you to enemies by placing a red dot over their location and allowing you to suppres their fire to move or move your teams around. You have command repsosibilities and the A.I. will help you out a lot later on in the game. There is fairly constant action and the graphics are impressive. There is a slow motion camera that kicks in when you get a good head shot in or throw a well placed grenade and enoy the German destruction. The only probablem was that moving out of cover once you have ducked down behind something was a little clunky. Instead of easily vaulting over while crounched or boltiong around a corner you have to pull back then walk around. In the heat of the battle this can get confusing. Overall this was a fun game and was worth every penny."
3,An OK Game,"I don't have a lot of time to write a long drawn out review for this game, but I will say that although the graphics are pretty sweet in the beginning and although the story line is beautifully done, I think that this game lacks playability. I just wasn't impressed with the controls, movement, or overall weapon use during the game..."
2,average game.,"I you have windows 7 with 64 bit, and you like cheat codes forget it, cheats do not work on windows 7."
4,Good game but wait for price drop,"This series always has been known for realism and historical accuracy. The graphics are lacking in areas, but it is an enjoyable and cinematic experience, if not a little short (and multiplayer is underwhelming)."
2,Hated it,"Did not like the game at all, The previouis brothers in arms was a lot of fun, but this version is definetly lacking. The graphics are visually stunning and the sound is great. However the gameplay is extremely lacking and the storyline tedious"
2,boring,"It is obvious the rave reviews were written by people with an agenda. Web reviews have become blogs for employees of the game manufacuters. This game is repetitive to the extreme. The controls are complicated and most the time don't work in time to keep SSgt. Baker alive. ""Press A to vault over obstacles"" is mind numbing, slow and a good way to get killed. When ""dug in"" he keeps rotating back and forth so much you can't aim properly. I have never played a game such as this [with the exception of ""Gears of War""] that is so repetitive and is an invitation to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. To place it in the same category as Battlefield: Bad Company [the funniest and most fun Xbox 360 game yet developed] or Call of Duty 4 is rediculous. Not even close. Ignore any review over 3 stars with this one. Col. Antal is getting paid by Ubisoft and, from a former USMC combat infantry officer, should be ashamed of himself for even mentioning the real combat soldiers in Afghanistan/Iraq in the same breath."
5,War-o-Riffic!,Impressive game. Not just a FPS -- you direct the actions of other soldiers in accomplishing goals.
1,BROTHERS IN ARMS HELLS HIGHWAY,"This game is very slow and frustrating. Good graphics. I cannot seem to understand if I am playing a shooter game, a movie game, or a strategy game??? Would be nice if it was just one or the other.Very disapointing overall."
1,I'd rather be in hell than play this game,"First of all, I bought this game to play LAN with 2 of my friends. We all got together to play and found out it didn't have a LAN function. Pretty annoying but whatever, we'll play on XB Live. Too bad this game is so garbage no one plays it anymore. Team cooperation is near zero, and when you die that's it. No respawning. There is only one game mode and its not fun. Single player isn't much better. The whole game has a cheap, rushed feel. Graphics/textures are crap. Voice acting and script writing is retarded. The character animations are emotionless. Its like watching moving mannequins with guns."
5,Very Impressive,"I've always been a fan of the brothers in arms series but this one blew me away. If you are looking for a very detailed, and near realistic game, this is it! The graphics are great esp with an hdmi cable. There are not very many missions but other things make up for it like the story line and destroyable cover (which was awesome too btw). I hope you enjoy this as much as I did."
4,great game,"The only good thing is the story.Online Sucks.This game is a FPS,Horror and Strategy all tied into one.The story has some scary parts to it in the cut scenes and the strategy part is telling your squad where to go.This is a great game for the money!"
3,lacks qualification,"When I oredered this book, excitment was the theme. Upon looking at the cover, I noticed the teacher of the year was on the cover. I liked the idea. As I read, I remembered having Tom as a teacher. He seemed to lack some of the important qualities listed in his almanac. I felt it was sort of inappropriate, or just maybe unqualified. I would be honored to have him teach me again, only under the guise of the person who wrote his book. It is excellantly written, engineuic, and one of a kind. I hope it is a display of more truth than fiction. Good luck, stick to the facts, and enjoy reading."
3,My First Introduction To Ms. Allende!,This is the first time that I've read Ms. Allende and maybe due to the fact that I've not read any of her previous titles I did not have any expectations when beginning this story and as a result found this a pleasent read.Although there were some slow parts I enjoyed the history of these two families but in the same breath found it at times difficult to follow the many different characters that were introduced. Still it was nice to be given a chance to know the various characters that make up this story and as a result given a chance to know the families.I look forward to reading Ms. Allende again in the future and recommend this book as a nice way to pass the weekend.
3,"A good read, but not exceptional","This book follows many of the characters Allende introduced in another novel, Daughter of Fortune. I actually liked this book a little better than Daughter of Fortune, because I felt there was at least a little more mystery involved. There are many compelling characters in the book, but, unfortunately, I didn't really think that Aurora (the storyteller) was one of them. Her grandmother Paulina was infinitely more interesting. Also, I thought the title was strained. It felt like Allende just tacked a paragraph or two onto the end of the story to justify the title. Although Aurora was a photographer, I didn't feel that the title naturally sprang from the work. Rather, it was foisted upon it."
3,Beauty in the storytelling,"I apprecaited the storytelling aspect of Allende's work, and had to work hard in the beginning to keep all of the characters straight. Once I kept reading, I found myself turning the pages to find out what happened to Aurora, and why she had such horrible nightmares. The last part of the book begins to get more interesting.....but I wanted more in the end.My favorite Allende book is still, Paula."
1,bad,"I didn't liked it, it's very boring and more of the same (from the first part daughter of fortune)."
2,Sequels are never as good as the original,"Portrait in Sepia is a sequel to Daughter in Fortune. The first book had wonderful characters and a good variety of characters. This book has mainly two characters, one of them from the first book. I found this book almost boring and depressing. It wasn't nearly as rich and colorful as the first. Nothing happy really happens. Isabel Allende is a good writer and I will read other book by her but I was disappointed in this one."
4,Portrait in Sepia,"I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read books with detailed and descriptive content. It was recommended to me by a friend who keeps up with bestseller and ""books to read before you die"" lists."
3,"Better than most authors, but subpar for Allende...","I like Isabel Allende. And PORTRAIT IN SEPIA is a good story, well told, but sometimes I felt that Allende phoned this one it instead of really working on the characters.I agree that the grandmother is the focal point of the story . . . I'm not sure that's what Allende intended, but you couldn't help but love the domineering, overbearing, bejeweled woman who paid to have a huge bed carted by the house of her husband's lover!I wish Allende had spent more time with a few characters, rather than filling the pages with so many comings and goings. Some of the characters really intrigued me, but they almost disappeared into the plot.I'll continue to read Allende because she's very gifted. I just hope she'll take more care of her craft in the future.Enjoy!"
3,Something lost in translation,"I've found all of Allende's other books compelling to read, hard to put down. This one was hard to get through for some ineffable reason. Maybe something was lost in the translation from Spanish to English, or maybe there were just too many characters and it was too large of a generational saga to fit into a 300 page book-maybe a five or six hundred pager would've given me the depth of character I was looking for, because I just felt unfulfilled when I finished. There are some really gripping moments and the main character, Aurora, seems to be a strong, interesting protagonist on those rare occassions when her personality really comes through."
4,the portrait of a pageturner,"I am a great fan of Isabelle Allende's ever since The House of Spirits, so I could not help loving this book who takes us back some generations before the first aclaimed novel."
2,Worst book by Isabel Allende,"I am an enthusiastic reader of Allende's books, and this has been a real disappointment. She seems to have lost her capacity to render the most intimate feelings of her characters, this book is very superficial and sometimes very dull.If you are interested in this author, read Paula or the 2 books of Eva Luna, which are real masterpieces."
4,Decent Book,"Although I didn't find this book as wonderful as some of the others that she has written, it was still a wonderful book from a very talented author. I went over my book budget to get this book, and I am not disappointed. If you want to give her books a try, I would recommend reading another one of her books first. If you have read her before, then give it a try. I think the opinion of the book depends on the reader."
4,From Platinum Print to Portrait in Sepia,"Isabel Allende is an encaptivating writer and story teller and she proves this again with her latest novel about the difficult life of Aurora del Valle's family. The people mentioned in her novel are all full of character and Allende manages to weave poignant lessons to learn from them.After reading and enjoying Daughter of Fortune, I had to get a copy of Portrait in Sepia and I am glad I got it. Allende keeps the reader magnetized to the family trees that she speaks of. I loved her tittle from the very start but was wondering why she had used it. Her last paragraph in the book answered my question making me sigh ""I wish I could write as beautifully as her.""While reading the novel, I was already visualizing filming the movie in San Francisco, Hongkong, London and eventually in Chile. I wonder whether she will eventually be doing a movie just like House of the Spirits which was excellent."
3,Mixed Review of Portrait in Sepia,"This book left me with mixed feelings. I understand why she titled it ""Portrait in Sepia"" as I have many times looked at an old sepia photograph and it evoked such a feeling of nostalgia and wonderment. This is the feeling of the story. However, I thought the writing was uneven, I guess that's the main reason I can't give it four stars. At times she wrote like Hemingway, as others have said, and then other times Kathleen Woodwiss came to mind. I didn't particularly like the writing style of telling the story. Sometimes it was boring with over-long passages about the Chilean wars and history and then at other times I found myself turning pages late into the night. It was an interesting story and I will definately read more of Ms. Allende's works."
3,As enthralling as an American soap opera,"Portrait in Sepia is as enthralling as any American soap opera, with beautiful women and reluctant lovers and mismatched husbands and wives.Portrait in Sepia is more than a great tale with intriguing characters and inventive plot twists, though. It's also a thoughtful look at the blending of cultures and ethnicities and the difficulties and joys the blending brings.Quite a ride!Note: I'd not realized Sepia is a sequel; I wish I'd known this and read Daughter of Fortune first."
3,Portrait in Sepia,Its mostly a review of Daughter of Fortune (which I read first) and it's a continuation of that book. Much of the story line is repeated. Too much detail about the war between Chili and Peru.
3,Maybe it's me...,"Maybe it's me, but I had a hard time getting ""into"" this book. It didn't keep me very interested, but I read on to see if it would get better & how it would end. I read Daughter of Fortune and it was much of the same way for me, but it picked up after the first 75 pages. I thought this would be the same way, but really it picked up in the middle, after 150 pages! It was a neat story to tell, but it could have been told faster, and therefore made the book more engrossing."
2,expected much more,"I was so excited when I found this book. I have an old version (1993)and thought this 2010 version would hit on the age of the internet... you know...Self promoting yourself/work vis website, blog, social networking.What I found? 2 pages on creating your website.That is it. Nothing about blogging, or networking via the internet.NADA.So warning, if you are expecting some Zen vision about developing yourself/work using the internet, it isn't happening in this book.Boldt's idea of life changing apparently means he's not looking to the internet that much.Look else where my friends."
3,author needs a writing course,"You know those people who have something interesting to say but then dont know when to stop talking? They ramble on and on and at the end you stop caring about what they are saying and just wish for them to finish.Well this book is that same experience - while there are a lot of valuable ideas here and there, the author's primary goal apparently was to fill as many pages as possible.And certainly, this book has little to do with Zen. It takes its ideas from philosophies all over the place. Nothing wrong with that, but if you were looking for applying Zen to your career search, you will be disappointed. In addition the book is not written in the spirit of Zen at all - it is more of an indiscrimnate bombardement of concepts than an exercise in saying the needful in a most careful, focussed manner.Still giving three stars though since some of the ideas were very inspiring nevertheless (though quite black-and-white at times)."
2,long-winded,"Like some of the other reviewers, I didn't make it through the first part of the book -- too much long-winded pseudo-mystical rambling. If it's never occurred to you that you should try to find work that you find fulfilling, this book might spark some reflection and insight. If it has, you're better off with Boldt's other book, How to Find the Work You Love, or the old stand-by, What Color Is Your Parachute?"
2,Almost painfully difficult to read.,"Although I have a four year degree in English, I felt strained trying to read this book. Everything is so long and drawn out - by the time I finish a paragraph, I forget where we started. Part One about killed me. I'm 34 years old, in the middle of the country, working from home. I don't need to soul search and philosophize - I know who I am, and I have no patience.Part 2 did have some useful information, but I was so burnt out from part one, my enthusiasm was drained. Will keep it as a resource book, but will never ""read"" it again."
4,Former college text but very readable,"Purchased it knowing it wasn't ""new"" and received the condition I ordered. Great price; Great service."
3,"Too much, but dig for the gems","Pros -- great information, excellent non-traditionalperspective, provides lots of food for thought, discusses values andpurpose in an in-depth fashion which puts other career books to shame.Cons -- WAY TOO LONG. There is a lot of unnecessary information in here which my be interesting, but is ultimately gratuitous, especially given that the reader is most likely already swirling with questions and conflicts regarding their career issues.I suggest this book be used as a reference companion to other more focused and action-oriented career books -- it has good things to say, but you wouldn't want to have to slog through the whole thing cover to cover. END"
2,The Fortress of the Pearl,"Reading The Fortress of the Pearl after Elric of Melnibone is a bit of a downer. The Fortress of the Pearl had no character development, and no events that pertain to the grand scheme of things. It's a mediocre adventure and is not redeemed by the characters. Elric is brooding and sycophantic, prim and proper. One second he is sucking up to someone, the next minute he is threatening to kill everyone. The main part of the novel is made up of the dream world where the pearl is located which is mostly metaphysical, and not very exciting. The only good thing about the novel is that it is short and simple, otherwise I would have never finished it. I hope the rest of the series is as good as the first novel was, and not like The Fortress of the Pearl. Big disappointment."
1,Not what I expected!,I wasn't happy with my purchase I bought this for me n my husband n it's stuff we could never do n it's from back n the 80s now all it's good for is the trash!
4,good workout,"The concepts in the book are beneficial and I definitely sweat when doing the exercises. I bought the book due to a chronic injury in the hopes of strenghten my core muscles. I think the book is worth getting and overall I would recommend it. For athletes in good shape though, you will start at level 3 or 4 and master the workout within a week or two. However, it is a good supplement to regular exercise programs."
4,Core Performance Essentials: The Revolutionary Nutrition and Exercise Plan Adapted for Everyday Use,educational as well as helpful - I'd recommend this as it also was recommend to me.
4,Good book!,"""Core Performance"" was a great introduction to core fitness, nutrition and lifestyle. No complaints - well written, concise... good book."
2,"You either need the full core performance book or a personal trainer, not this","You should either know the whole theory and figure out what you should be doing on your own, or get a trainer. Trying to get the shortcut (i.e. the exercises without the theory or the $ for a trainer) will be a let down, because, frankly, you can't do the exercises easily while following the book and it's not the type of thing you can take to the gym. That's not to say it's a badly done book by any means, maybe you can get what you need out of it, but for me this type of book was a bust."
5,JRB...is he a God of musical theatre?,"Okay, so I'm from Chicago and saw this show 5 times there. I LOVED it. Jason Robert Brown is my favorite composer. I was lucky enough to see him and Andrea Burns in concert in Chicago before this show opened and hear them perform songs from it. My favorite it ""The Schmuel Song."" I cried like a small child when I saw it the first time. I LOVE Sherie Rene's take on ""I Can Do Better than That,"" too. This album, like ""Parade"" and ""Songs for a New World,"" is perfect."
4,Fantastically Different,"I originally bought this CD because I love Sherie Rene Scott and I was hoping to hear more of her amazing voice. After listening to the CD, I realized I had lucked out and had found an amazing CD. The story and the creativity behind the story and the music is wonderful. My only disapointment was that in some of the songs, I felt like the lyrics did not always fit. However, after listening to it a few times, I realized that it gave the musical a very conversational tone. This musical is so much fun to listen to and belongs in every musical lover's cd collection."
5,Last 5 Years,Saw a local production of this fabulous show. Had to get the soundtrack and I love it. The CD was delivered very promptly.
3,Not great but well built and musically interesting,"I saw this musical a couple of months ago in Buenos Aires and was impressed by the way the sweet-and-sour story of a young couple is told. With only two characters on the stage, this musical examines the relation of these lovers starting with the beginning of the affair and-immediately after this- ending up with the break. So the story goes back and forward until, by the end, you get a full idea about the circumstances leading to the separation. I would define this show as a chamber musical, perfect for small spaces, intimate atmosphere, simple anecdote and good music but nothing great."
2,Not as good as Chicago live performance.,"I saw the show in Chicago. Then I bought the album hoping to capture the same energy. It lacked something. I really don't know the difference. Was it performed by different artists. I didn't remember the names of the two here. Maybe all musicals are better live (I think so). Anyhow, the songs are well written."
5,Jason Robert Brown is the new king of broadway.,"I was informed about 2 months ago by a friend that you are a bad person for not listening to this musical, so I bought it the next day. And after the first song Still Hurting, I felt like a bad person for never hearing it. This is a great CD and Jason Robert Brown is an amazing composer. I have all of his CD's that he has in production and I highly recommend anything by him."
5,Still Listening,"I bought this CD two years ago. I am still listening to it today on a regular basis (at least once a month). The score is great. The performers and their performance are wonderful. If you are a fan of musical theater, you will not be disappointed. What more can one say?"
5,Great Soundtrack,I love this whole CD. All the songs are fun to sing and memorize. I haven't gotten sick of this CD after months.
5,A composer deserving recognition,"It's easy to see why this broadway show has not gotten more attention from the general public: it's not exactly shallow upbeat fun for the whole family. It is however profoundly beautiful in it's writing and heartbreaking in its message - another confirmation of Jason Robert Brown's genius in the musical theater genre. The music moves from the lighthearted (actually fall on the floor funny) comedy of ""A Summer In Ohio"" to the smoldering sadness of ""Still Hurting"" without sounding like two separate musicals, but rather an amazing portrait of a slice of life we can all relate to. One of Brown's greatest strengths is his ability to showcase beautiful evocative lyrics without compromising the music. Each element of the song stands on its own helping to convey it's message in a powerful and musically beautiful way. If you like thoughtful song writing and haven't heard his music before this CD is worthy of listen."
3,not quite what I expected,"I was expecting a book that would show a child what to be truly thankful for ie., food, mommy, daddy, grandparents, love...not toys, cars, trucks, teddy bears = materialistic."
3,Not what I was looking for..,"I was hoping for a book that would say bless my mommy, bless my daddy and bless my grandparents. This book doesn't mention family. It mention cars, trucks, bears and bed. This is a good book but not what I was looking for before bedtime.I prefer that Thank You Prayer by Josephine Page. The book isn't a cardboard book but it's built toddler tough. This was more of what I was looking for."
1,Price? Are we serious??,I have purchased this wonderful board book for many years as a gift from the Nursery Team at our church to new parents. The simple message is appropriate and one that would be welcome in many faith traditions. I came to Amazon to purchase another copy and was anticipating spending what I had in the past - about $7.00. With the price of a new copy posting between $350 - $900. I'm trying to imagine why the price jump and figured I must have ordered the editions not dipped in gold. I'm saddened to see this.
5,"An Educator reviews, ""Astronauts...Space,"" (Dreamquest...)","I use ""Astronauts and other exciting careers in Space"" in my sixth grade middle school classroom. It is exciting and holds the interest of my energetic students. It is useful for inspiring my students to aim for higher goals, such as working for the space industry, and for teaching character building as well as for giving them reasons to stay away from drugs and to stay in school. The filming is excellent and shows pictures of actual astronauts working in space and even doing stunts in their weightless condition. Ed Flanagan offers a Teacher's Discussion & Resource Guide with the video when he knows it is for a teacher."
4,Turophile ( Lover of Cheese),"I make cheese, run a website and forum at CheeseForum, and borrowed this book from a library to broaden my knowledge of different cheeses. ""Artisanal Cooking"" does this to a small extent as only 12 pages on cheese intro, buying, handling, storing, serving etc and a listing and description of the authors' favorite American Artisan made cheeses. However, to its credit, it is a beautifully laid out book recipe book, albeit not a lot on cheese!"
4,(Expletive Deleted)!!,"I had to edit my own title , because I get so excited every time a new Luna CD comes out. This EP is fantastic. I will always be a fan of these guys. They write the best honest-funny-ironic-weary songs around. Luna has that sound that I love, a guitar band that doesn't bludgeon you with them. The guitar work here is cohesive as always. Solos tasteful, melodic always. Songwriting is A plus as usual. The Stones cover is really languid and cool. The instrumental is good too. This EP sounds like they made it in a loft late at night jamming after hours. Make sure you catch these guys live sometime. All hail , Luna!"
4,"Great first track, interesting covers","Not up there with the band's mid-90's stuff, but some tracks come close. Overall, a very warm, comfortable sound inhabits this E.P. Have not popped it into my computer yet to look at the videos, but that's a nice bonus. Note to the person who was annoyed by ""Neon Lights"": it is a cover of a Kraftwerk song. That's why the lyrics are repetitive and simplistic (not necessarily a bad thing, but certainly not a typical Luna thing)."
5,"Great , but for older children","This book/playhouse is great and so cute but too detailed for my two year old. I should have paid attention to the age suggestion. If you have a 4 year old +, it would be very entertaining and fun."
1,The actual price for this item is 5.99 (each),Please be aware that the seller will charge $5.00 USD each for shipping in the US. If you buy 5 of these your shipping cost will be $25.00 USD. Therefore consider the price of this item to really be $5.99.
4,El General Did Not Record El Meneaito,"So there is no confusion, if you are looking or El Meneaito, El General did not record it. It was recorded and made a hit by Gaby, and produced by Big Daddy G. and The Karma Master. El General is a great Artist, and one of the original contributors to Reggaeton. Muevelo is a very good song, but he did not record or create El Meneaito."
4,Good,Have only read Christine Feehan part so far and as always she is a great read. will continue with the rest after I have completed what I have of Christine's dark series
3,"One star for each author, no stars for Feehan","This is another of Feehan's short story introduction into a new set of stories. This time about South American Carpathian brothers. It starts out very interesting and quickly turns into jungle sex and the story dies off. If you are looking at this book for more Feehan, unless you are a die hard have to read it all, pass on it. There is nothing in it to miss that will not be mentioned in the next book.The other stories were sort of interesting but I got to them only when I had nothing else in hand to read. I had not read any of those authors before. But none of the stories inspired me to read other works by those authors."
2,Huh ????,"I'm a big Vampire Books Fan (Maggie Shayne, Sherrilyn Kenyon, you get it....). I have to say, I kind of tired of Christine Feehan, she writes always the same stuff (Carpathian gets injured, has to go in the ground and so on). I like stories that have a little ""bite"" to it and have a little humor to it. This book, especially Angela Knights story, was at times almost pornographic, sorry. If the hero wouldn't have had fangs, it would surely be in the ""adult"" section, geez....none of those stories gripped me, really. I guess I'm just not a short story reader...."
1,OMG!,"Now, I haven't read any of the other stories beside the last one by ANglica Knight and I have to say that it was the worst romance story ever. I really think she had the right idea not to give in and that story depressed me so much I would like to take a gun to my head right now and kill myself. Now that I haven't felt this way before, but that story was really bad. That council was horrible gangbang her until she gifted?!? That was truely horrible. Through I think I will more than likely enjoy Christine Feehan entry in this book."
5,A great addition to any collection that will have you looking for more,They stories are ranged each different and encompassing the reader to keep going. The final in the book a great look into a another version of King Arthur and his knights as vampire. Very addictive and you just have to know more. Excellant works
4,Sex AND Horror? Yummy!!,"This book has four separate stories of horror, including vampires and werewolves, but told in smoldering, sensual ways. For those who like romance combined with the suspense of horror, you'll enjoy this book."
5,This is a good short for the Dark series,"They mention the leads in other books and it was good to get to ""know"" them and their story."
3,Not her best,"I love the Dark series, but this one was barely ok. I actually liked the other stories better, even though I only got the book to read Ms. Feehan's story. This one was a short story, so it's not completely fair to compare to the full lengths. The one redeeming quality is that she brought in the jaguar species from Scarletti. South American version, of course."
5,Dark Hunger,I am a huge fan of Christine Feehan and her Dark series books I have read every one of them and have never been disappointed. But this IS my absolute favorite book that she has written yet I absolutely love how she did the love scene (yes I'm talking about it lol) I love the chemistry from the two and how strong they both are. I would recommend this book to my best friend as soon as I finished reading it I opened it up and read it all over again! I have yet to read the other stories in the book so sorry I cannot give a review to those. I hope that if you are on the fence about buying this book that this helps you with your choice to buy it it's an amazing story I would have liked it if it were a bit longer but it was still a very good book.
5,Hot Blooded Review,I love reading Christine Freehan's books. They are excellent and capture the imagination. Every time I read one I see the movie in my mind. She spins a wonderful story very detailed.
2,hot blooded,the story starts of really good then out of nowhere you have to stuggle to finsh the story.
4,Are some of these stories reprints?,"I really enjoyed reading this anthology, but was disappointed because I believe, despite the copyright dates, that two of these stories have appeared in other anthologies. I know I've read the Shayne and Holly stories before, but since I sell alot of my books right away, can't find the previous publication. Did the stories seem familiar to anyone else?"
5,Best Anthology this Year,"This is the best collection of short stories I have read this year.Dark Hunger by Christine Feehan is great, if you have never read one of her novels about the Carpathians this is a great beginning.Awaiting Moonrise by Maggie Shayne is very good. If any could be said to be slow this is the one. However, if you like werewolf stories you can't beat it.The Night Owl by Emma Holly was awesome. I really enjoyed it and it gives you a taste of her novels about the upyr. It really made me want to buy some of her other books.Seduction's Gift by Angela Knight was so good I think it will set the scene for a whole new series similar to Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunters. I liked the premise and enjoyed the story.This was a very entertaining read for the afternoon. I don't think you could possibly be disappointed."
4,"Wicked, Wild, Wonderful","The terms I would use to discribe this book. Clearly all the authors show great talent but Christine Feehans rises above the rest. Her ongoing Carpathian saga is compelling, each book or story give you a deeper glimpse into the dark magical world of the Carpathians. I bought this book for Ms Feehans story and while I enjoyed the others I felt that the last story dealing with King Arthur being a vampire, while hot was a little too over the top for me. I might try something else by this author but overall I would not recommend this book on her story alone. The others are worth reading and to try stories by different authors is a wonderful way to expand your horizons."
4,Funny and a great introduction to the new swank culture,"The retro-ish styling of the book introduces the once stylish world of mixed cocktail. Even cooler was the fact that the book also included a few non-alcoholic drinks for my dry buds. It not only is a good resource, it makes a great coffee table book as well."
4,An explosive concoction for your shelf,A fun and tasty look at the kitschy side of cocktails pleasantly put together and easy to look at. I bought this book and Hollywood Cocktails which looks at cocktails through the silver screen. Why have just one cocktail when you can have more?
3,Didn't match description,"The actual covers were fine, but they did not fit my vehicle. The description and picture indicated that they were for seats with built-in seatbelts, but there was no way to get them on - no opening for the seatbelt. Very disappointed that I had to return them."
2,Great drawings not so good scanned,"great drawings of big author, worth the have it, but I saw originals in Vienna and must say that I was bit disappointed when I saw the drawings in the book. I think that they are not to good scanned. Originals have very thin lines and in the book that lines are not so thin, so much detail because of that is lost. Second, on original drawings some parts are sticked, and you see that in different shades of paper. And in the book all is on white paper so you cant know which part is collage. Hope that was helpful"
4,"Very good, A must for all Queen fanatics","""Queen: The Early Years"" details the lives of the four members of Queen before they were stars. It follows John Deacon, Roger Taylor, Brian May, and Freddie Mercury from their respective births and childhoods to the release that got them world-wide acclaim: Bohemian Rhapsody. Be warned though, if your not a die hard fan, I don't reccomend this book. It, at times, relies heavily on knowledge of the music business and English geography. Overall, it's a marvelous book which provides insight on what events formed Queen and it's four diverse personas. As the author says many times, ""Your not going to see any of this in the authorized biography""."
3,If you're a Queen fan...,"...then you will enjoy this insight to the early years. If you're looking for a more in depth bio after they became the royalty of rock, then you might want to look elsewhere.I've been a fan since 1980 and thought I knew pretty much everything. It was very interesting to read up on the pre-Queen era. I especially enjoyed reading up on Freddie and being able to see him evolve into the rock icon he became. It would have been nice if there were more photos, but over all I found this a nice addition to my collection."
4,"Bit dry, but informative for new Queen fan","A bit dry in spots, and if you're not a die-hard Queen fan, the diversions into people & bands peripheral to Queen's beginnings can be a bit tedious. But overall, it's a straight-forward book, devoid of the cheap, gossipy tone found in many other books on Queen and very informative about the band's genesis."
4,A peek at the formation of one of the biggest rock bands ever,"If you want to know who and how Queen was formed and a little about each member in their early, formative years, this is a good book.If you want salacious details about Freddie Mercury, pass on it.I found it interesting to see the genesis of this intriguing band that would, to a large extent, change the face (and voice) of rock! A little of Freddie's ""star"" attitude and his mannerisms early on are also revealed.His on stage persona was in stark contrast, often, to his private one.It is worth a read for fans of the band. That would include yours, truly."
3,Not Bad,"Get past short bio's of Brian, Roger and John and onto Freddie. These are very short and generic. Freddie is always interesting and fun. Jim Hutton and Peter Freestone's accounts are personal and heartfelt. Mick Rock and Leslie Ann-Jones writings are in my opinion, must reads.Lets face facts one Freddie Mercury biography is not enough. Silly me, I thought one would be all I'd want but now it's very hard for me to get interested in other books.Wish Bryce Courtenay would pen Freddie's bio and Humphrey Bower to narrate."
4,Nice book,"This is one of my son's favorite books right now. He loves to look at the pictures and tell me the name of each vehicle pictured. He also recognizes these when we are out and about. The only negative thing I have to say about the book is that I wish it had more of a variety of vehicles rather than multiple versions of same type. Some examples of the pictures that I find repetitive are a tractor and a tracked tractor; harvest combine and a harvest forager; giant excavator, mini excavator, and an excavator."
4,Great Pictures or Truck Fiends,"My Big Truck Book is a nice, over-sized board book with a whole lot of photos of things that GO packed between the covers. It loses a star for labeling a clapped out 80's van as a ""Mini Van"" and for using a lame picture of a truck for the pick-up photo. A lot of the vehicles are European with the steering wheel on the ""wrong"" side of the car. Those things aside, there is a really big variety of vehicles and my one year old does love to look at it."
1,This Book Is Not Accurate,"My three year old son received this book as a gift with mere excitement, only to be devastated. While the pictures are bold and bright the context (name of the pictures) are completely false! Even my three year old knows that a disk (farm equipment picture) is not a Plow. Come on Roger Priddy do you and your high priced publishing firm not do any research before writing your books? It is obvious that this author, Roger Priddy, is more concerned with making money while teaching children wrong information. This picture book contains 40 photographs with name depiction and of the 40 pictures 11 are named incorrectly! There is better children's literature out there, this guy is a joke!"
4,Trucks,"I am not extremely knowledgable about trucks (I see a review here where a person is disturbed about the accuracy of how the trucks are labelled) but I certainly give the book a big thumbs up for the beautiful imagery and the durability of the book itself. I think that the trucks may be a bit similar for my daughter (17 mths old) to distinguish the differences but going forward I believe she'll be more interested. For the younger set, I think a book covering a broad range of transport vehicles may be more appropriate, I purchased this because what I was looking for was out of stock."
5,My 3yr old LOVES this...,"My 3.5 year old son received this book in his Easter basket. He loves trucks, construction equipment, and tractors. This book is just perfect for him. On numerous occasions I have caught him with his light on in his room reading this book after we have put him to bed. He matches his toy trucks to the pictures. I highly reccomend this book if you have a little one that loves trucks!"
5,Great book for children that like trucks,"My oldest son received this book for his first b'day in 2003. The book is still going strong after lots of use and now my 2nd son, born 2007, drags it around the house. As a parent, I don't like reading it because it is boring (how many times can you say tractor in 5 minutes and not be!!! :)) But since my boys love trucks and construction equipment, etc. I will read it over and over again."
5,enjoyable,"My three year old grandson loves big trucks, when I saw this book I just had to buy it for him. When he opened Christmas Eve, he just lit up. Thank you again for the wonderful offer."
3,"excellent book, poor binding","My 2 year old loves this book, but the binding has broken twice over only a few days. He carries the pages around with him. Granted, he is difficult on books, but this book fell apart way too soon! Content and pictures are outstanding for a toddler that loves big machinery."
5,purchase,"Very nice quality, and a great value. I am very pleased with my purchase and excited to the look on my grandsons face."
4,Great Truck Book,My son loves trucks so I bought him this book. He's eager to learn the names of all of the trucks in the book. Great book for the little truck fan!!!
5,My granson loves this book,"I recently brought this for my grandson's ""construction"" themed birthday party and of all the gifts he received, he loved this the most."
5,Great Truck Book,"I bought this book for my nephew (23 months) for Christmas but should have gotten on for my son (21 months) as well, they fought over it big time. Great book for a boy or girl, who loves trucks!"
1,Bait and Switch,The saw in the picture is a very good American made tool. Unfortunately it isn't made anymore. It's replacement is an inferior Chinese piece of crap.I was lucky that the vendor Heavy Duty was a stand up company and accepted my return and refunded all of my money including shipping. This is a great company and I will do business with them in the future.
3,replacement parts,We love you product...but would like to know if you sell parts for this product. We have owned two of these hacksaws and have broken the front part that holds the saw blade in. Do you have this part for sale?
4,First Take,"I bought this album, having heard part of the 13th on the radio. I chose this version after reading several reviews on Amazon. As a casual classical music listener (and community orchestra performer), I am pleased with the recording. The three pieces present differing looks into Haydn's vast catalog. I don't feel qualified to discuss the quality or historic significance of the recording, but I will say I heard no obvious technical flaws. No doubt, Haydn wrote more compelling pieces - I love many of his later symphonies - but the 13th just struck me on my initial radio exposure, and hearing the entire work here did not disappoint. Number 36 is nice, but doesn't move me like the 13th did. The passing of the themes between several instruments in the Sinfonia is interesting - I shall have to listen to it many more times before I decide if I think a ""shared"" concerto works for me."
1,Policemen,"I should have looked for the size of them, I was disappointed because It was to be a Christmas present for my grandson and I thought they would be something he could actually play with. If I was into miniature scenes maybe they would have been alright but that isn't what I was expecting."
3,"Only an average book, IF you are absolutely new to Flash","This is only an average book, if you are absolutely new to Flash. The reason I say this is because I am fairly okay with Flash, meaning I can make simple animations, modify other's, but am no pro at one. I know that this book is for beginner's, but I think that doing things in a more 'hands-on' fashion would teach you far better than reading how to make animations from a book. It would be better if you purchased Flash reference books instead, so if you ever needed help, THEN you go to find the answer. Also, you could just visit sites such as www.flashkit.com to find your answers or post on their forums."
1,Never again,"To the reviewer who would purchase this cd again...you can buy mine. I made the mistake of purchasing this cd without listening to it. I thought it would be of the same, top-notch quality that the others were, but this one sounds like it was made for a cheesy bar. Volumes 1 and 2, especially, have been favorites for years. I am very disappointed. If you want melody fit for meditation and true ""Quiet Times"", don't buy Volume 4. This group has been wiped off my ""favorites"" list for good."
1,Be careful this is the miniature edition.,It was not that clear that this was a miniature of the original book. ...
2,"The book title should be ""The Power of Wishful Thinking""","This book is dangerous, particularly for naive people who believe that they can achieve anything by thinking positive. When you face risk or danger, you have to explore and weigh the possible negative consequences. I strongly recommend ""Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self"" by Dr. Rosalene Glickman. This brilliant, realistic book points out the pros and cons of positive thinking. It teaches you how to make the most of any situation and achieve your goals, without wishful thinking. You learn how to ask the best questions to get the best answers. You also learn how to identify and understand disturbing emotions, use them as optimization signals and make the most of them. In this age of terror and technology, you can't waste your time with wishful thinking. Optimal thinking is the optimal path."
2,to simplistic for our time,I started this book after hearing so much positive press about it. I stopped reading the book in the middle of the first ch chapter. the likelyhood that someone will find this book interesting I believe depends o on whether can change by developing and changing his character or whether one can change one's performance by learning quick techniques and formula solutions. I'm firmly in the first camp.
2,Might Want to Pass This Up,"This strikes me as a bit funny to leave a somewhat negative comment about a book called ""The Power of Positive Thinking"" -- forgive me. First of all, I bought this version without realizing just how small this book actually was. I knew it was a miniature edition, but this is just a hair bigger than the smallest of post-it notes. That is small! Oh well, I can carry it in my purse, right? While I enjoy the affirmations that remind me to think positively, I am not a very religious person and I very quickly tired of the numerous biblical references. In retrospect, I would have bought something else."
2,Small,"when purchasing the book it said ""miniature edition"". I didn't realizethey meant the whole size of the book. Probably 2"" x 2"" square.Still excellent reading though. Positive Affirmations."
3,ordered by mistake,"I ordered this by mistake. I somehow missed the fact that it was mini-micro small version. It was like 1"" X 1"". For the price I paid I didn't even think to look to see that it was a paperback. It went in the trash. Don't buy this over getting someone the audio version. They really need the real book not the chapter headings."
2,Small? Try tiny.,"We ordered this book thinking it would be smaller than a traditional hardbound copy; however, we were rather surprised to find out it can fit in the palm of your hand. Useless format."
4,Vol 2 of Half Magic,"This book follows the children in Half Magic as theygo on vacation. This time it isn't a coin that is magic, butan entire lake. Of course wackiness ensues. This is anothergreat 'chapter' book to read to 3rd-6th grade kids."
4,holly's review,"This was an excellent book. The view of relationships among siblings, and acceptance of each other's idiosyncracies, was accurate and positive. The adventures were imaginative and unexpected. There were many lessons to be learned relative to not repeating past mistakes, not jumping to conclusions, and not being judgmental of others. My only criticism was that in some areas, such as the beginning, the book moved a bit slowly for kids. Our 2nd grade Book Club chose this book to read, and it was a little hard to get my son to stick with the slower parts, to get to the exciting ones."
3,"This book was well writian, but it had a bit to much fantasy","This book was about a family of kids who go down to a lake house, and the kids wish for a lake full of majic. They wish for may different things, but most of their wishes backfire. They go many places in their wishes, but eventually end up in the wrong place. This was a good book, but it had a bit to much fantsay. I think that if a book has fantasy, then it also has to have reality."
2,Grimaud plays Chopin: Chopin loses,"This is my first encounter with Grimaud's playing and I can't say I enjoyed it much. Grimaud pounds the first two movements of the Chopin sonata into submission, rarely stopping to pause for breath or reaching anything below a forte. As for her ""gorgeous tone"" (as Dan Davis puts it), her sound gives a rich new meaning to ""chalky."" Her attempts at lyrical playing in the Trio of the Funeral March and the Berceuse are remarkably metronomic, and her trills in the latter are distictly unmagical. I suppose some will regard such playing as ""powerful,"" but to me its mostly noisy. The Barcarolle is somewhat better, though no competition for the likes of Moravec and Lipatti. The Rachmaninov sonata, a remarkable piece of junk, fares better in Grimaud's heavy hands, but I doubt if I'll be listening to this cd in the future."
1,Student-like playing!,"It is amazing that critics as well as audiences can praise such mediocre Chopin playing!!! Did you forget people like Dinu Lipatti, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Ignaz Friedman, Josef Hoffmann, and just recently Radu Lupu, Martha Argerich, and the brilliant Adam Harasiewicz, not to mention such excellent, if not brilliant, talents like Murray Perahia and the most successful piano comedian Lang Lang. Even the recent mediocre competition winners like Yundi Li and Alexander Kobrin play way better than Grimaud can ever even dream of.Grimaud's Chopin and Rachmaninoff as well as Brahms and Ravel are on the student level: overpedalled, generic, technically inferior, lack musical ideas, not to mention having new ones, in one word - boring!In addition, the cover photo is nothing much to look at. The eyes are beastly empty and express only nothingness, exactly like the playing. The pretentious, quasi-philosophical booklet writings only confirm the impression from the photos and the performances."
1,Item picture is not accurate,"Just a warning to potential buyers that the product may not be identical to the picture above. The picture shows a chain with eleven links, while the product I received only has eight links. That means the chain is 2.5 inches shorter than expected. Probably not a problem for most, but we needed that extra length for our use. That's why I specifically purchased this item rather than others that showed a picture of chains with eight (or fewer) links."
3,not quite what I was hoping for,It's ok .... didn't have any success in using it. There are better bleat calls out there. I'll probably try it again next year to see if there's any better response
1,Don't bother,It looks nice... that's about it. Don't be fooled by the Bass Boost button and equalizer -- all they do is make your cds sound like AM radio instead of worse than AM radio. A true waste of money unless all you want to do is look at it.
2,classic accesories colorado pontoon boat,2nd time out one of the valves broke while inflating. A bit concerning since it broke for no apparent reason. Customer service was quick to ship me a new valve but I'm concerned about the quality of valves used on this boat.
5,Great little boat,There great boats for running the rivers here in New Mexico. Easy to put together and store.You sit high in the water and is very comfortable.there easy to control.The one that I have is green.wear your pfd
4,Top quality,The colorado pontoon boat is a top of the line product for a reasonable price. I live in oregon and have used the boat on rivers and lakes in my area and I was impressed with how durable and well made the product is.I definitely recommend this product..
4,riveting new thriller written in an erudite style,"I enjoyed Grail Conspiracy very much.writen in a most felicitous style that engages the reader and the author carries his considerable learning lightly.I confess that I am a bit of a prig and I know that I know allot more trivia and history etc than most educated people---and thus I was very impressed to find McGaulley dropping so many pearls with so little fanfare!the story is fascinating: I thought from the first 150 pages or so that we were going to be in a Da Vinci genre look-a- like but he shunned that.It was a 'page -turner "" and the juxta positioning of the different actions certainly maintained the thrill of the tale.I feel sure that this should do very well if reviewed in NYT or similar influential paper."
5,Beautiful Music,Opera Without Words and Classical Heartbreakers are the best music CD's of my collection. I have played them over and over. I love them because the music is so beautiful and produces an environment of peace and love.
3,an introduction to opera music,"If you're taken aback by Opera singing, check this record. Very well known opera excerpts without the voice... Just what you might have wanted to take a first step in the right direction. It's no masterpiece, but it makes for nice enjoyable listening."
5,On Top of the World: Five Women Explorers in Tibet,"I love reading historical adventure books and this was as good as I expected. It was not a ""page turner"" but an interesting account of these women's explorations. I am surprised I have never heard of these women before as they were true pioneers. I recommend this to anyone who likes reading about travel adventures."
1,Velcro barely attached,The velcro was barely even attached to the wrap. Looks like it could rip off quite easily. I wouldn't recommend this.
4,NOT Clash of Civilizations but contact and mutual borrowing,"At least until recent times major civilizations gradually shared, adapted, borrowed, and sometimes transfromed material elements of civilization and even ideas. A wonderful overview of history before European colonialism introduces eaxamples and processes for a valuable perspective that should be read by area specialists and others tending to see things from the view of a single nation, faith, or culture. The pace and shock of change increased with modern communications and powerful force producing perhaps a different story from the period after that so well reviewed in this book. One might start with Phillip Curtin and Wolf's ""peoples without history' for this later period."
3,history book,the book is in good condition for being used. i got it for my history class and it came fast
3,Not really the original,I really thought they would be exactly like the ones we had in the 70's. The toe grip on these shoes is not as large as the 70's ones/ Overall I still like them.
3,Very comfortable but busted after only one summer of wear,"I love the way these shoes feel and look. I wore them almost every day this summer. Unfortunately, they seem to only last one summer. The clasp broke just the other day as I was walking, and my shoe fell off. Luckily I was at home so I did not have to try to get home without a shoe. I thought these would be better quality - that's why I bought them. Am a little disappointed as these are my second pair of Dr. Scholl's that have broken. Don't think I will buy them again. Shoes should last more than one season."
1,Cheap imitation of the authentic original...,"I have no issue with the buckle--it is easy to adjust-- just search on the reviews, here. But, after a screw fell out, I tightened all of the remaining screws only to discover that three of the screws on the opposite shoe simply turn without tightening. I'm sorry to say this because I really loved these shoes in the past, but this newer version is junk."
4,"Very cute, they definitely get noticed",I remember wearing Dr Scholl's wooden sandals when I was a child in the 70's so I was excited about purchasing a pair after all these years. I fell in love with the red suede model with the pink hearts. The look of the sandal definitely did not disappoint and I get lots of compliments and questions about where I got them. As for wearability they are good for short distances but the top part painfully rubs on the foot if I wear them all day. I saw a few tips from experienced wearers in the Amazon reviews in regards to this problem and I plan on trying them out. PS - this pair indicate they are made in Italy.
3,Too big.,These sandals are a classic and I love these sandals. They are a little too big. I'm a 7 1/2 and sized up after reading the reviews saying to size up if you're a half size. I really wish I had sized down instead because they are loose around the strap. And I have not figured out any way to tighten them.
4,VERY NARROW,"I've worn these in the past and loved them. The fabric is just what I wanted and the perfect color. HOWEVER.............the medium width is so narrow that I couldn't wear them, even on the last hook. Sadly, they were returned."
1,Adjusting the Buckle,"I read the instrutions here on how to adjust the buckle but they do not work for me. I'm about to send these sandles back. Can anyone explain, very simply, how to move the buckle so I can make these shoes fit tighter??"
2,I just don't get it..,"I truly never understood what was so great about these shoes. Before I got them and wore them, I liked them better.. After wearing them, I realized they were just plain.. clunky. I clunk around in them all day. I haven't worn them in a while, needless to say. They ok in the comfort department, but not great. And, as some other reviewers mentioned, I was never able to get the hang of easily adjusting the strap. I only tried a few times, because, again, I didn't wear them all that much, but still. There are cuter shoes in the world that don't make you feel so dumpy and frustrated."
2,Toe ridge/grip is not what it used to be,"I recently ordered the ""Original Dr. Scholl's Exercise Sandals."" They came today, and I plan to return them for a very important reason: The toe ridge, or the toe grip, is absolutely nothing like the ""original"" Dr. Scholl exercise sandal. I knew as soon as I saw the new shoes when they came today that the ridge was not the same as the ""original."" I compared the new shoes side-by-side with a pair I've had. The difference in the toe ridge in the new shoes is significant. It is almost flat. The toe grip is the best feature of the Dr. Scholl's exercise sandal, and is Dr. Scholl's big selling point. I think the description of the toe grip in their ads for the ""original"" exercise sandal is misleading, because it just isn't what it used to be. I am disappointed in the shoes for this reason, and will return them. I started wearing Dr.Scholl's Exercise Sandals in the late 60s and I've been a fan ever since, until today."
3,Dr. Scholls Sandals,"These were popular when I was a teenager - but my parents could only afford the generic version. So, I decdied that after all these years, I would treat myself to a real pair. They are comfortable but I still cannot adjust the strap. My husband and I both tried. I can't loosen the buckle - even following the enclosed directions. I don't wear the pair that I purchased because they slide off of my feet. I am disappointed. I will probably end up selling them on eBay (unless I can figure out how to adjust the dran strap!!)"
2,Add $40 to the sales price for replacing the soles,"It's just like some of the reviewers were saying: After about 2 weeks, you will need to have the shoes re-soled and that's not cheap. They're comfortable but slip off your feet easily."
5,Ahhhhh....the good ole' days,"I've always LOVED these shoes! I didn't know I could still get them until recently though. Take your time wearing these for the first few days. It was a little uncomfortable at first with the side of my big toe, but now it's all good.It took a little adjusting here and there but now they're a great fit. Definitely a great buy. Other sites sell these for MUCH more. Great price, great fit! Still would have been nice to find them for less than $10 at the local drugstore like I used to, but times change."
3,"OK,but..........","Well,the first time I wore these for a couple of hours I got a blister on my big toe.I just put a bandage on and didn't wear them for 2 days.The first time I wore them for several hours at a time,I went on a long walk with a friend,and when we got home I noticed the rubber bottom by both heels had completely rubbed off~leaving bare wood.I was walking on a paved surface,so it should not have torn off that easiy.They are very comfortable once you get used to them...but the workmanship is kinda shoddy.I'm just hoping I can take them to a shoe repair place and have new rubber put on the bottoms."
3,for my wife,my wife have the same. but the we got looks like a copynot like the original Dr Schollsbut she liks it & the price was a good one
3,can't move strap size!,cannot wear cause they are set too big and impossible to move straps- unlike the ones from the old days!
2,not like i remember them...,"These were a bit of a disappointment in that I remember wearing these as a teenager and LOVING them..I liked the idea of wearing wood, plus I used the muscles in my legs so it kept them in shape, but they seemed (after 30 some odd years) heavier and if you don't get the leather, they look a bit cheap. Plus, my foot kept sliding off of them so, the rubber worked better for me."
1,"They're darling, but I can't adjust the strap","Like Denise above, my foot slides forward too and I cannot adjust the strap either. I tried everything, even prying open the thing that looks like it would release the buckle, to no avail. All I ended up doing was making a mark on the metal! I haven't worn them outside, so will probably take them back, which is a shame because they are absolutely darling ... I got the pink plaid ones."
4,Suki and the Invisible Peacock- important lessons in life,"I purchased this book for my nephew who loves Peacocks. This is an endearing story about a lonely Japanese-American girl who makes up an invisible friend (the peacock) who teaches her some of the most important lessons in life. Themes of diversity, acceptance of our own individuality, unconditional love, self esteem and friendship are present throughout the story. Invisible friends are common in childhood, but in this story, the peacock seems so real to the reader that we begin to believe he is real too. Suki's father encourages the relationship with the invisible peacock and tells her such imagination can lead to good faith as an adult. The peacock teaches Suki to be humble and to love all others (even the school bully), just like God does. A good lesson for all. The book is 63 pages long and has only black/blue pen-and-ink/illustrations (although tastefully done, may not capture the attenttion of younger readers)."
4,Oil,"I'm a prime customer and received the Briggs and Stratton 2-cycle oil in 2 days. The product is a Easy Mix, Low Smoke Formula. It's 1 8oz bottle and seems to work fine."
2,Toyotomi TAD 32 problematic,"I purchased the TAD 32 in 2007. Worked well for about 2 years of infrequent use. We needed a unit like this, because we could not put window units in the front pf the building. Problems started to occur withe the wireless remote, which is also the only control panel for the unit. If the control unit or communication between the remote and the TAD 32 fails, there is little you can do with the unit. The remote failed. Toyotomi customer support was not good. Bought a new remote for about $ 35. Tried programming it and the new one would not work either.Repeated emails and calls to Toyotomi went unanswered. Maybe I had a lemon or maybe that control unit is ill conceived."
2,WOW WHAT A LOW PRICE!!!!!!!,"JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF ADVERTISEMENT I SAW FOR THE SOLEUS PORTABLE A/C, THAT WAS PRICED AT 64.99.TELL ME. EXACTLY HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN? AMAZON SHOULD HAVE SOMEONE REVIEW THESE ENTRIES FROM TIME TO TIME TO PREVENT THIS KIND OF MISREPRESENTATION.IT LOOKS PRETTY BAD!!"
3,Lacks a Little Something,"I own 1940's house and can watch it time and time again. This documentary however, about a family living in a 1900's house lacked a little spark. The family whinged throughout the documentary especially the mother and eldest daughter, and there wasn't any focus at all the the young boy. The family also didn't always do things authentically which made watching it annoying and slightly disappointing.Having said that, it is interesting to see how the average-income family would have lived in the 1900's with their furniture, their household budget and income, and entertainment."
5,King of the Reality Shows!!!,"The 1900 HouseThis is the absolute BEST (and original) reality show ever! Watching the Bowlers try to adapt to the lifestyles of a hundred years ago is amazing. No matter how many times I sit through it with my students, it never gets old, and each year's students appreciate as much as the previous ones."
4,"Fantastic, but too brief a visit","At four hour-long episodes, we are merely there and back again in too short a time. (Even worse, the entire first hour alone is devoted to the preparation of the series.) While informative and insightful into the everyday life of a middle-class English family in the year 1900, this series is simply too short.It's not nearly as grand in scope as my favorite, ""Manor House"" series. While Manor House was isolated in the country, the 1900 house is situated in the middle of a modern neighborhood with cars visible out any window. People dressed in modern clothes stop by and the family shops at a present-day market. While the interior of the house is accurate to the last teacup, the outside world intrudes too much and breaks the illusion of living in the past.Don't get me wrong, 1900 House is very much worth watching -- but the journey is over far too quickly. An absolute must-see for anyone interested in the sufferage movement or women's studies."
5,Wanted this for years.,"I watched this PBS series when it was first broadcasted. Been wanting to see it again. Searched for a long time and many people only had it available on DVD. Most people wanted around 150.00 for the DVD. I chose to purchase it on VHS and bought a VCR just to watch this program again. If you get the chance, this is an awesome series showing how mankind reacts from living in the material world to living as it was in 1900 and going by every rule, no exceptions. The family that was chosen thought it would be so fun, well I don't want to give the story line away, but it wasn't as easy as they thought it would be."
1,very short article,"For a little more $, you can get the whole book, Made to Stick by the authors. This very short article introduces one useful idea, Curse of Knowledge, but without all the context and related ideas that make the book so valuable."
3,good for motorcycle use heavy for bicycle,"I love this lock. the cuff on one end is a great idea. You don't have to mess with a cable and lock separatley. The only problem I have is that it is very heavy for a bicycle lock. unless you are pulling a trailer where you can store it, you will have a hard time trying to figure out how to trasnport it without the cable getting in your way. I know it would work great for a motorcycle or moped where weight is less of an issue"
2,Ehh,"I locked my bike with this lock and the next day, it was gone. Found out the thief actually cut through the wire :("
2,Dead on Arrival / Fixed problem no thanks to mfr.,"Update: We just didn't know how to use the product / pushing in the cylinder locks it - the key has nothing to do with activating the lock. I'm still giving this a bad rating because this would be so simple for the manufacturer to respond and let us know, rather they did not respond at all to their web site inquiry and another Amazon reviewer helped us out.I purchased this item 39 days ago -- today was our first bike ride where we needed a lock. We arrived at our destination and the lock would not lock. What a piece of junk. So instead of the long bike ride and nice breakfast we had hoped for, we had a very long bike ride no food - and since it's over 30 days, Amazon won't help. Useless item, and a great lesson about buying on Amazon vs. a retail store that will take care of these problems for me after 30 days."
4,"Okay, but ...","The cable is nice, very long and multi functional. I have found it very useful for locking up my Piaggio Fly 150. Though I must say that sometimes is is difficult to open."
5,las llaves del exito de napoleon hill,el libro es muy bueno y el servicio ofrecido por amazon fue excelente estoy contenta con los productos.
5,dorie,Errol Flynn has in my view never made a bad movie ! This film has plenty of action and romance throughout the film. I love this era where this dvd is based. Well worth owning this movie.
5,Sail to adventure with the Sea Hawk,"Errol Flynn was in his home element as the captain of a privateer in the service of Queen Elizabeth. A true swashbuckler, this is alot of fun. The story is full of intrigue, action, humor and romance. The production values were high for this movie. Add to that a cast that included Brenda Marshall, Flora Robson and Claude Rains. Also look for some of the best character actors of the day, like Alan Hale, Donald Crisp and Una O'Connor to round out the movie. See sea battles and swordplay aplenty to make for a rousing good time. One note, this was made early during the second world war. The final scene with the queen was added as a morale booster for the audience in England.Warner Brothers did this up right with this release as part of their Warner Night at the Movies. Dvd comes with Newsreel, Short, Cartoon and trailers. As included is a featurette about Flynn and this movie. You got to get this one!"
3,entertaining fantasy,"I watched this movie when i was a teenager years ago, then again now in my thirties. Not very accurate historically, since pirates, buccaneers, corsairs or the so called seahawks would never dare in real life to attack a spanish war galleon, only slightly or unarmed merchant vessels. This movie is however very entertaining with all the swordfights and adventure not to mention the message the directors wanted to send concerning the begginings of World War II."
3,A letdown for this Flynn fan. ----- Brenda Marshall!!???,"As someone who greatly respects Errol Flynns work, I must say I was disappointed in this movie. A year before in 'Dawn Patrol' I thought Flynn gave a great performance as a hot shot fighter pilot, who when given Command must accept responsibility for the lives of his men.Critics have said that Flynn's 'Sea Hawk' role is a mature performance, to me it's a dull turn by Flynn. He is not helped at all by a clunky script and a stunningly bad performance by Brenda Marshall. She brings NOTHING to her roll as the female romantic lead. A truly terrible performance by this young lady.In Captain Blood (his American debut), Flynn has verve, enthusiasm, amazing charisma, he rightly became an overnight star with that performance. But, he looks somewhat bored in this film. It is an OK, 3 star film, but please don't mislead people and compare this movie to 'Robin Hood', or 'Captain Blood', or the terrific 'Charge of the Light Brigade'."
1,Godawful rotton copy !,"Absoutely ambsymal, grainy, poor quality, former LIBRARY copy, hard to see, too dark, . . . I would never have even considered selling this to anyone, heck, I wouldn't have even donated it, it's actually that bad ! This is most unfortunate because I am a huge Errol Flynn fan, have most of his films, and only wanted to augment my collection with a ""COLORIZED"" copy of this movie (I feel that color would/could have enchanced the scenes of a fine swashbuckler). Alas, 'twas not to be . . ."
3,Good...but Great?,"I've been an avid Flynn fan for years...but I always thought this was weak. Flynn seems too restrained and like what a previous reviewer stated ""all the ingredients are there but the cake didnt rise"""
4,Whitcover pulls a Teddy White,"Theodore H. White's ""Making of the President"" series set the standard for campaign books. White ended his string after the 1972 campaign, and it is from there that Whitcover picks up the torch. Witcover is a excellent journalist and a fine writer. He chronicles the chaos of the 1976 campaign on the Democratic side and shows how a determined darkhorse named Jimmy Carter was able to outlast his many rivals in part by getting an early jump start on them. He also documents the bitter nomination fight between Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford that almost tore the Republican party apart. Lastly, there is the general election in which Carter started with a huge lead and blundered his way into winning by the closest margain of any election since 1960. This is an excellent book for politics junkies."
3,"Pretty Good, Pretty Good","For those who think Jimmy Carter was a pious Christian and never said a bad thing about anyone, read this book.For those who think Gerald Ford was right - or wrong - in his pardon of Nixon, read this book.For those who remember the far left policies of Muskie, McGovern, and Humphrey, read this book.For those who barely remember Frank Church, Morris Udall, and Fred Harris, read this book.For those who want to understand how Reagan learned from his 1976 mistakes - particularly in his selection of a running mate - and won four years later, read this book.In short, if you like politics, read this book."
5,Very Readable and Objective Overview,"As somebody not alive during the election, ""Marathon"" was educational, enjoyable, and informative. The candidates, primaries, and general election are all objectively covered. The books covers in great detail the issues. I would recommend this book."
3,"Account of 1976 election lacks nuance, human touch","What bothered me most about ""Marathon"" was that through 700 pages author Jules Witcover never gets underneath the major candidates' skin (Carter and Ford). This book is much more a long newspaper article than a biography of the powers of 1976. There is little depth, but it is heavy on names and numbers. Witcover seems happy to point out seeming inconsistencies in Jimmy Carter's public statements, but as a scholar he never gets to the nuance. I'm still not sure what Gerald Ford ran on in 1976, how could the author leave this out? As a review of 1976, Marathon is barely adequate--and it is a very far cry from quality leisure reading."
4,good background,"This book was an excellent introduction to visual basic telephony...If you are interested in a beginning book on Telephony and how a telephony application would work in a point and click environment, this book is a solid choice."
1,big disappointment,"This book belongs on the ""out of print"" list. A promising title, but lousy content. Instead of providing useful materials on developing telephony applications in Visual Basic, the authors, in essence, used this book as promotional material for their own Visual Voice software component which works with Visual Basic 1.0, long outdated considering VB 6.0 is about to be replaced with VB.Net . The rest of the book is an overview of Visual Basic, telephony terminology, and even talks of Windows 3.1. This book is overdue for the recycling bins."
2,visual basic telephony,"In general, it is well writen: easy to read. However, as I worried, it was a little bit outdated. And, there were not surficent explanation on codes for visual voice. I wouldn't recommend this book if someone wants to learn how to write a program using visual voice in visual basic environment."
5,recommend,"This book does an excellent job of introducing queer theory into communication. As a graduate student of communication, I purchased the book on my own accord to gain more understanding of the intersection between the two. Knowledge of Judith Butler and Michel Foucault will help those new to queer theory understand the ideologies."
3,Nice...,"I think this book had good passion but it lacked a good reasonable plot. There was no reason Helena could not have told Ram why she was where she was and when. It certainly was better than letting him think she was loose. It was a good read but a little irritating too. If I had to read it again, I would."
2,Disappointing,"Be warned, this book is misleading when it says on the cover ""Get What You Want in Every Situation Using the Classic Book of Changes.""Reading this book was fascinating; I felt like I was learning so much. Then I asked my question, tossed my coins, and read up the answer. I didn't have a clue what it meant. The verbiage is too esoteric and obscure and leaves too much room for wishful thinking and misinterpretation."
3,It's Ok,"If you're looking to really get into the i ching and try to comprehend it beyond a bunch of philosophical ideas. This isn't the book for you. I like Joseph Murphy a lot so i'm a bit unwilling to bash this book too much but as soon as i read it, i wanted to basically sell it because i wont need it in the future. It's not that kind of book where u can go back and study and i think the I ching is just one of those things that you'll be going back to forever as long as you're casting yarrow stalks or coins."
1,A Thorough Disappointment!,"I bought this book after reading the sample text; believing that I was getting a book filled with Eastern Wisdom, NOT Western Christian Dogma. I will be deleting this item from my e-book reader and chalk it up as a contribution to Amazon.com."
5,Excellent MUST READ,"I can not state the value of this book, since it made me aware of what was wrong with my business early enough for me for me to fix it. I am an entrepenuer with a several rapidly growing businesses, and without this guide I would have been in trouble. Having this book really saved my business!"
4,I WANT MORE BY THIS AUTHOR,This book is so full of information that I want more by the same author. Please write a sequel.
2,Disappointing,"What a disappointment is this disc. The harp playing is quite nice, though the handling of the viola is hardly what one would expect from the English school. The tone is weak and tinny, sounding rather like a violin fitted with viola strings. Tertis would have been sorely deceived."
4,"Dark, gruesome, and awesome...","Michael Keaton dons the cape and cowl in what is the best of the live-action Batman movies. No Robin in this one, as it centers around the origin of Batman and Joker. Tim Burton's directing is dark and almost scary. The sets for Gotham City were revolutionary at the time, looking gloomy and melancholy. Gotham is a dirty, ugly city and Burton portrays that perfectly. One complaint: there could have been more development of Batman. Keaton is given little to do here, but he makes a good Batman nonetheless. Most notably is Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker. His presence in this movie is enough alone to steal the show. Nicholson is a highly talented actor and this movie confirms that statement."
5,Batman and The Joker a classic showdown.,"Batman is a great comic book movie. The pace keeps it from dragging. Jack gives an inspired effort as the Joker, Michael Keaton does well as Bruce Wayne and Batman. The supporting cast do a good job Jack Palance stands out. This is a dark violent film. The Jokers warped sense of humor gives enough laughs to to break the tension, the gadgets, weapons and vehicles are inovative. Batman has never been done better."
4,The Only One That Captures It Perfectly,Once again the original is the best in the series. Burton does everything right. Its not too gothic yet not like a normal film. The style is exactly like the comics and the story is great too. It was also smart to have Keaton(the worlds most overlooked actor) as the Dark Knight and Nicholson(usually extremely serious) as the comical Joker. It was too bad that we had to wait 16 years before another decent batman film(Batman Begins).
4,Batman the origanal,This movie was good and it had the action and all the batman stuff but the joker could have been better in my opion but other than that four star movie in my book.
4,Nostalgic Reward,"I'll be the first to admit that nostalgia fuels a sizeable percentage of my purchases. I remember when Dave Matthews Band was cool in high school and I keep buying their records now, even if I don't like them like I used to. The same goes for the original, animated Transformers movie. I bought that before the 2007 movie came out, watched it once, and realized that my tastes have changed since I was five. That movie is almost unwatchably bad. This Batman film, however, is still awesome. I love it. It's still my favorite, even after Batman Begins blew me away. Jack's Joker is great and Michael Keaton will always be my Batman. The look and feel of this movie is dark and exciting without being oppressive. Occassionally the strain on your suspension of disbelief is a little much, but this movie is still well worth your time and your money."
3,The Great Bat Hype.,"This movie is so over-rated.This movie is boring! All the characters were flat, boring, and lifeless. The one exeption would have to be Jack Nicholson who plays a great Joker. He really brings the Joker to life for this movie. When he was on screen were the only times in this movie that I didn't yawn.Batman's costume looked like it weighed 300 pounds. He didn't look like he could MOVE, much less fight crime in that big rubber suit.I love Batman. He is one of my favorite superheroes.(He could outsmart and beat Spiderman's little candy-butt any day of the week.) but the way he is portrayed is this movie just doesn't cut it for me. The Dark Knight had no depth and Bruce Wayne looked like a skinny little geek rich-boy.(No offence to Michael Keaton.)Good movie, not a great movie."
1,DONT BUY THIS SET,"Coming October 18th are special editions of Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, & Batman and Robin."
1,"THERE SHOULD BE MORE, THATS ALL","This is a fantastic movie, believe me. The one star is because there should be more included. For cryin' out loud, when this movie came out in 1989, there was a media hype that was out of this world. Where is all the behind the scenes specials? Trailers? Posters? Interviews? Commentary?!?! DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? or whatever its called got a friggin' comentary but not this classic piece of movie making. Whats the deal with that? MOVIE: 10. HOW IS WAS PACKAGED FOR DVD: 0"
1,THE MOVIE SAVES IT,"Okay, I have not bought or watched BATMAN on DVD. I already own this fine film on VHS. Why 1 star you ask? Simple.With all of the hype...all of the propoganda...all of the BEHIND THE SCENES stuff I've seen on SUPERMAN (recently released), why the devil do they NOT do this with BATMAN? C'mon! What's the purpose of owning BATMAN on DVD when there is nothing special about it?!? The film is excellent and is worth 5 stars. But I am reviewing the DVD - THE DVD, which in the year 2001 is ridiculous. C'mon Warners! What the devil are you thinking? I remember the BATMAN-crazed hype in 1989. I remember a behind the scenes special and a whole lot more.As for this one, it rates te same as the others. If you want the film only, its worth it. If you want some special stuff like ANY DVD NOW HAS NOWADAYS, forget it. Buy it on VHS."
3,MICHAEL KEATON JUST NOT BELIEVABLE AS BATMAN...,"... what really saves this movie is the casting of Jack Nicholson as ""The Joker""... a better choice for Batman back in '89 would have probably been Alec Baldwin (when he was still in shape)."
3,al right,"It's the first batman movie and it really wasn't that good. Jack Nicoleson was good at joker. But this movie just doesn't catch you. The story between Bruce and Vicky is okay. Tim Burten filmed it well,the action wasn't that good, and compared to the others except the fourth one it doesn't stand a chance."
4,The REAL Batman(Keaton),"This is an excellent film. I keep reading that the first two Batman movies(Batman and Batman Returns)were dark and evil...my god this is BATMAN the superhero that lives in a cave not the Carebears that live among the rainbows and clouds etc. Real Batman fans see and appreciate what I'm trying to say here. All in all, I highly recommend this to your VHS/DVD collection, it is truly a work of art. Michael Keaton gives an outstanding portrayal of the dark knight, Tim Burton did a great job. Now for the rest of the films after the first two...well they just blow...Joel Schumacher really [messed] them up...real bad. I hope you enjoy this film..I did"
4,"""Specialises in a gothic perspective-good.","Tim Burton's creativity and limitless imagination is attested to in the original Batman instalment.Features the appropiately cast Jack Nicholson as the nefarious, pasty-faced harlequin-Joker, ravenously overembellishes in the malestrom of the role, outstaging his co-stars."
5,WOW,"It all goes down hill from Batman Returns...Keaton we love ya -- no matter WHAT you look like.and that's not the point. He's only human -- after Burton, Batman became...a cartoon. Someone save the bat."
4,BATMAN,"Although the superior ""Batman Begins"" reinvented, reimagined and reinvigorated Batman, this, the original, still stands alone as a very good movie. Tim Burton's ideas and vision of Gotham and the Dark Knight look great on DVD. Forget the color-laden, comic book""Batman Forever"" and the horrible, unforgivable ""Batman and Robin."" By-pass the box set and add this and the special two-disc edition of Burton's even darker follow-up, ""Batman Returns"" to your collection."
3,pretty good better than the other ones that have followed,this film is pretty good.it's better than the other 3.Tim Burton does a good job but he has done way better films with less cash&hype.Jack Nicholson does a good job.Michael Keaton is real chill.Kim Basinger is her usual dull self.the music overall is hit&miss.
3,I thought this came with a Digital Copy?,The Blu-Ray is great.. but isn't this suppose to come with a Digital Copy? If so.. I don't have it with the copy I bought from Amazon.
1,Why is Prince's Partyman video edited? WHY!?!?!?,"Bought this to get the Prince videos and watched in horror as I discovered that they put a poorly edited version of the Partyman video and not the full version. If they ever do another special edition of Batman, they MUST include the real versions of the Prince videos and not crappy edits."
2,Batman Too Dark,"Noone is a better Dark Knight than Keaton. Noone will ever fill his shoes, well boots. But this original is too dark and the story is on the border line of being flat and dull. Didn't think every much of it. I don't think any Batman films in the last ten years has done the comic justice."
4,Good MOvie,The Only reason i'm writing this review is to diagree with Quintin Xavier this is not an adult movie it's a teenage & kids movie sure they won't get the part about his parents dying until thier older but why would WB make a kids cartoon & comics into a movie.
5,Easily The Best,"""Batman"" is easily the best out of all the ""Batman"" films. It has a better cast than all of the other films in the series and it is the best directed one also. Michael Keaton will always be the best Batman. The sets and production values in this film are also amazing."
4,Well made film. Helped with a Strong Direction by Tim Burton,"When a Millionaire named Bruce Wayne (Underplayed by Micheal Keaton) turns himself into a Crime Fighter Caped Crusder known as Batman. When a Dangerous Man named Jack Napier (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Jack Nicholson) turns himself as The Joker, Who wants to take Control of the City of Gotham.Directed by Tim Burton (Ed Wood, Mars Attacks, Planet of the Apes) made a Well Made Action Film. The Highest Grossing film of 1989. Nicholson steals the film here. Although it falls flat at the film last half hour but it's still entertaining. This film has a Fine Supporting Cast including:Oscar-Winner Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Micheal Gough, Pat Hingle, Oscar-Winner Jack Palance and Billy Dee Williams. Followed by Three Sequels. Grade:B+."
3,BATMAN,"August 22nd 1997 was the day the greatest superhero motion picture of all time, BATMAN, was released on DVD, eight years after its cinema release. Since it was an early release, it was what fans were used to, but as years went by, extras-stuffed DVD's were released, and fans realized that the Batman DVD is very disappointing. The DVD only contains production notes and biographies, and the picture/sound quality is poor. Let's hope that the rumour that BATMAN: 2-DISC SPECIAL EDITION is being released on 3rd October 2005 along with the other films in the series is true."
5,Great movie from when I was a kid,The movie is amazing. Takes me back to when I was kid. I think Keaton had the best overall take on both Wayne and Batman. I wish him and Burton had the chance to do the third and fourth movie and it would've been a nice little quadrilogy to the Batman mythology. Still a great movie and worth the buy.
4,Definate Plus,One of the first comic book hero's who came the big screen. And what a way to go. You get the dark and alomst gothic feel to the movie. And the acting well done by Micheal Keaton. The storyline was excellent. A movie for the ages for comic book lovers
4,Awsome,"Although there are some minor gripes, this is by far the best Batman film. Sorry Val and George fans."
3,Split Decision,"Here is why I gave this DVD a 3. I love Batman to death. I still remember being 6 years old and going to the theater to watch it. And plus I can honestly quote the whole entire movie, I've seen it that many times. It's one of the best films ever. However, like most of the reviews, the DVD features suck. I was disappointed that there were no extras. However, I can still watch the DVD at anytime. That is why I give it a 3. Oh yea, I'm Batman."
2,My childhood memories shattered again,"Now Batman was an alright movie, but its definitely over hyped. The series has gotten more attention now that the Dark Knight series has been in theaters, but its definitely not the same kind of movie. The quality of the plot line is somewhat lacking, and it often leaves the viewer scratching their head. In the final fight scene, the movie is so dark you can't really see whats going on, making it very anti-climatic. I would have been better off not buying and keeping the old childhood memories."
4,"Not the best in the series,but still enjoyable.","Batman Forever is the best of the series,but this a really close second.Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton are great in this.Nicholson plays Joker to the the core(he was even nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance)and Keaton is great as Batman,athough I think Kilmer was better.Anyway,a great movie!Followed by one terrific sequal(Forever),one that is very underated(Batman and Robin),and one that is just plain awful(Returns,boy I HATE tht movie)."
2,Much too dark,"Like any child who grew up watching Adam West's Batman, I was instantly disappointed with Tim Burton's vision for the character. For me, Batman represents that shining beacon of hope to the hopeless, and he always seems concerned for the safety of others. At least, he used to. Sadly, it seems that Batman is gone, along with Robin, the Batboat, the Batpoles, the Batcopter, and classic villains like Egghead and Louie the Lilac.In their place, we get a Batman who relies on gadgets more than brains, a Joker who hardly ever laughs, and fight scenes without the trademark ""Pow""s and ""Zap""s. It may have a decent story, but I'll always look at this big-budget bust as a missed opportunity."
2,You call this a movie????,"The first Batman movie has got to be one of the most cheesiest heroic movies of all times. I've watched this film over and over and over again, and it still doesn't get to me. It's full of too much romance and way too much violence. I wasn't too thrilled with the pick of characters for this film. Jack Nicholson did an okay job as ""The Joker"", but again here's another movie where Michael Keaton is playing himself. He never takes his Batman job seriously. And I can't stand Kim Basinger in this film! Her wardrobe is God-awful!! When you're on a date, at least comb your hair and put on a decent dress than something handed from a second-hand store. And I can't stand her screaming in about every other horror scene. This Batman movie was a joke to begin with. The other two Batman movies were okay, despite the last one was without Michael Keaton.I was hoping for an action-packed movie when it first came out, unfortunately, I was very disappointed."
4,"""BATMAN"" SHOWS HOW A COMIC SUPERHERO FILM SHOULD BE DONE.","Even if ""Superman"" is a decent movie, Batman is the real thing; Tim Burton created an ultra-stylized film, and his dark version of the superhero paid tribute to the true spirit of the comics, instead of using the style of the TV comedy series; in my opinion that was the right choice.This film is also the best of the series; when Tim Burton and Michael Keaton left this movie franchise after ""Batman Returns"", the quality of the rest of the films was pretty poor. In ""Batman"" there are a lot of things to enjoy: good performances (Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson of course, Kim Basinger and Jack Palance, to name a few), good music, great sets, ultra cool gadgets (the Batmovile is amazing) and a very interesting story.A comic superhero film is not an easy to make, but Tim Burton proved to be the right choice in this film."
3,Great Movie...Horrid DVD,"Sorry. Just watched the, so called, widescreen version on DVD...and neither side of the DVD had the widescreen version. Both sides were anamorphic. Buyer BE-WARE! I was very disappointed!I know it's older, but the picture quality was grainy and the sound was NOT 5.1 Dolby. Pls note that we are blessed with a top-rated home theater system and we watch and enjoy movies ALOT.We also watched Ghostbusters yesterday on an HBO HDTV broadcast and it was absolutely beautiful and it is 5 years older than Batman.I agree. This was the best Batman movie ever made. I love Keaton and Nicholson in it. I'm just so sad tht it is such a lousy transfer. Just be ready."
4,The best one of them all.,"This is the first of all the Batman movies that followed, and still is the best. As over-the-top as Batman is, the rest of them went way to far over the top. There couldn't be anyone else except Jack Nicholson who could have done The Joker justice!"
4,By far the best Batman movie.,"I might go as so far to say it is the only good Batman movie. There. I said it! This is the only good Batman movie. Burton's Batman does not have any of the cheesy cartoonish-ness of the later Batman films. His characteristic dark moodiness gives the first Batman an edgy hipness that the others definetly lack. This is not without humor, of course--Jack Nicholson makes a wonderfully perverse Joker. I also love Michael Keaton as the unlikely superhero. Kim Basinger is a little annoying as Vicki Vale but oh well, you can't have everything."
5,Well Scripted! Well Acted! Well Done!,"Yes their is simply no better movie then Batman. All my life this movie has always been their if I was down and I just wanted to have some fun. The dark knight, Batman, has an amazing costume which makes this movie as wonderful as it can be. The acting is superb, every chacter played their roll here. Actor that staneded out the most here was definently Nicholson! Keaton Was outstanding as well, it just goes to show that he's a true comedian as well as a serious actor. A very good story, finished off with an ending that no one can complain about. Batman gets 5 stars simply because it was one of the best movies ever made."
3,Collection,Good item to add to my Comic movie collection so my kids can show there kids and keep the imignation alive. If they still have DVD's by that time
4,The Viewer from Canada -read this and please understand.,"Well, I do have only a few compaints. One is that people over look the fact that while seeing Nicholson as the Joker is highly entertaining, if you are a true, avid reader of the comics (especially Frank Miller's ""Dark Knight Returns""), you know that there are people who could have played the part better. The maniacal grin is not, according to the comics, a permanent condition. Plus, Nicholson is, physically speaking, not an equal of the comics' Joker (Tall and wire-thin). Even so, this is a very minor complaint, and I must admit that this is the best of the features. As an answer to the viewer from Canada, comics aren't necessarily ""just for kids"" anymore. Any pro in the field will tell you that. Look at ""Spawn"" and such and you'll see what I mean."
2,Really Much Closer to the 60's Batman than I expected.,"I had seen this film in 1989, but had forgotten that it really wasn't that much better than the 1960's Batman. Worse, the 80's fashions are no longer in style and make this film even more laughable. Disappointing film from Tim Burton. I think I actually enjoyed his first Frankenweenie better."
4,Batman Blu ray 20th Anniversary Edition,The movie is great but the digital copy from iTunes offer expired in March 2010.Bummer!Dave in TX
5,Michael Keaton rocks it out in Batman,Michael Keaton is a really good Batman. One of the best Jokers is in it. He is Jack Nichelson. Kim Basinger and Pat Hingle are also in it. This is a relly good Batman movie.
5,Batman (2 Disc Special Edition) DVD,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift, and while there was some misunderstanding initially about the product, everything turned out all right and he loved his gift. Another successful Christmas!"
4,Batman 89 review part 2 part 1 on 2 disc special edition DVD reviews 8.5/10,Continuing Burton has a gothic gritty dark style Nolan has a more realistic crime drama & realistic villains but I prefer Jack Nicholson's Joker he felt more like the Joker but Heath Ledger's Joker clicked very well for me too he just sucks you into his performance. No knock on Christian Bale his Batman just seems way to invincible & I do relate to Micheal Keaton's Bruce Wayne more so than Bale's. Honestly I wouldn't compare 89 Batman with The Dark Knight I would compare it with Batman Returns. I know I have p$$* off a lot of comic book fanboys & Dark Knight fanboys with this review.
5,Great Blu ray!,Very pleased with this blu-ray. The cover art is great and the features are many. The quality is also superb on my 32 inch lcd. This is a must have for any Batman fan. Now onto Batman Returns on Blu ray!
2,Movie great pulls it to 2 stars,"listen, YES this is one of the greatest comic book movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorites across the board, but what is Warner Brothers thinking about not giving this DVD an upgrade to a special edition. Look at how many movies have been given this honor that have been flops. U.S. Marshalls for one. Knowing Tim Burton there has to be a ton of material waiting to be used to have hours of extra features. I would love to see even some new interviews with the cast reflecting back. PLEASE GIVE US SOMETHING THAT IS WORHTY OF THIS MOVIE!!!!"
1,Terrible Blu-Ray transfer ~,"I just wanted to point out that this is not true 1080p transfer. Sure the box might say 1080p, but this is not high definition. It reminds me of the first shipment of Fifth Element which was basically DVD quality on a Blu-Ray disc. That was recalled and Sony issued an apology. Now Warner needs to do the same for this film.The film itself is a classic, but just don't upgrade to this version, you will be disappointed with the film quality. It looks no better then the standard DVD version.(For the record, I put in the Blu-Ray of Lawrence of Arabia right afterwards, and let me tell you- that is a real Blu-Ray remastering!)"
3,I thought Batman could really fly.,"I was really disappointed at the movie, because Batman got beat up so much. Sure, he was smart and strong, but most of what he relied on was the Batman Suit and gadgets. He couldn't even fly; What's so cool about batman if he is so normal! It seemed to me that he was great only because he had all those money to get all those nice equipments. Though the end with the Batman Airplane hanging unto the moon was very nice, but I was amused that such a great plane was incapable of shooting accurately at a man at most 20 meters away. It just looked fake. Also, I would have liked the movie to be less SciFi, a more I-am-your-neighor kind of feeling. Really, I tried to like the movie more, but just couldn't do it."
2,"Triumphant Movie, Poor DVD","...I am anticipating the Special Edition release of this DVD. I have read reports that it is to be coming out this winter from Warner, but a official statement hasn't been released yet. But it is definitely needed. The surround sound on this current disk stinks. The picture isn't horrible for a 12 year old movie, but it could be a heck of a lot better. The widescreen version on this disk might as well be full screen because it almost fills the screen. I loved this flick when I saw it the first night it came out and is one of my childhood favorites, the DVD I have doesn't do this movie justice!!"
3,"This movie is O.K, but the director forgot to call for light","The original Batman film is certainly a decent movie, but it suffers from the facts thata) Keetan is an awful batman. He has a fat face, wears turtlenecks in the batcave, and his lips stick out every time he wears the batsuit, which really ruins his serious acting.b) I know this movie is supposed to be dark, but there are times when you can barely tell what is going on it's so dark!There are some good parts, like when a swordsman comes sumersaulting at him screating, but is easily beaten up. However, this one only rates second as the best batman movie, with batman 3 and 4 tied for first."
2,If you're gonna adapt a comic book for a movie...,"stick with the damn comic book. This gets 2 stars for Nicholson and Palance. That's it. Every kid who's ever read Batman knows the Joker had absolutely nothing to do with his parents' death, much less saying anything to Bruce Wayne as a child. Gotham looked like a sci-fi fan's fantasy, not like a super-hero's domain (yes, that's a fantasy, too, but of a different sort; a ""real-life"" sort). The whole museum ""dance"" sequence, other than an excuise to showcase a Prince song, was pointless. The whole thing actually, was disjointed and rambling, and yes, I agree Burton was far more concerned with visuals than authenticity. This film wasn't wonderful when it came out, and it hasn't aged well at all."
1,Not my Batman,"Batman Begins is soooo much better than this or any other of the batman movies. Nicholson SUCKED as the Joker. Joker is a comedian who had an accident trying to pull a robbery to help his pregnant wife. HE IS NOT A GANGSTER OR THE ONE WHO KILLED BATMAN'S PARENTS!!!! HE IS A PSYCHO AND BATMAN'S NEMESIS!!! YOU CAN'T KILL HIM OFF!!! HOW STUPID IS THAT?!!! Who came up with that one. Keaton is a sissy, Christian Bale could beat him down!!! Keaton DID NOT have the physical prescence to play Batman. All in all, a joke of a comic movie..But it is better than Daredevil!!!!:-)"
3,Could be better,"The best scene in this film is the first one, in which Batman appears to beat up some common thugs. We get the sense of dark mystery about him that the early comic books contained. Tim Burton is an interesting directorial choice, and the overall look of this dim picture is great. However, Nicholson is simply annoying (and there are gratuitous scenes of him dancing round an art museum or clipping up photographs from God knows where that simply don't make a lot of sense) and we never get a very satisfying dismissal of him at the end. Basinger is useless too."
3,Thank you,But when I received the package as soon as I opened the envelope you can tell the piece that holds the movie in place broke so it was not package well. Since it was a gift I didn't have time to return it or complain. I just hoped for the best that it wasn't scratched too badly n played well.
5,Really great classic,Great movie... Cant go wrong with the classic joker..the original batman and the classic view of gotham city and the bat cave!!
3,A good all rounder,"Batman is a good example of a movie that can entertain. It has humor, it has action, some nice effects, and a good cast.Most have heard about Batman, but its really not Batman that does this movie, its the movie in general that makes it good, unlike the sequels."
5,Great job Burton! This is Batman in his best form!,"This is such a great flick! Filled with great action and a good story, this film is definitely true to the Batman Saga unlike Schumacher's wrecks.Keaton IS Batman. Nothing you could say can make me think otherwise. He's a great Bruce Wayne and a fantastic Batman.Thankfully in the Tim Burton Batman movies, Batman doesn't take a backseat to the villians which is what happened in the Schumacher movies.This movie, Batman Returns, and ALL of the animated movies are the TRUE vision of Batman.Don't waste time on renting Schumacher's flicks if you havent seen them. Trust me, as a big time Batman fan, you're not missing a thing with them.Tim Burton rocks!"
5,Great early 70s soft rock!,"Bobby Vinton is one of the greatest singers and this CD consists of 2 albums he released in '72 and '73.I love that early 70s easy listening pop and Bobby presents that style admirably.He does a lot of covers,and puts his stamp on each one.Haunting and pretty,through and through."
1,Not Helpful,"This book is waste of time if you really want to learn about anorexia. It's very difficult to understand and the author seems to have some odd ideas concerning his clients. I also think he tends to encourage being too blunt and forceful with anorexia sufferers, something that only pushes them away. He also doesn't permit his clients to have enough choices in thier treatment."
2,9 Perfomances that barely enhance the experience,"9 short stories by 9 different authors, each ""performed"" by someone else (""Letting Go"" by Ken Wisman performed by Susan Anspach & Will Patton; ""In Gethsemene"" by Stephen Gallagher performed by Christopher Cazenove; ""The Big Sky"" by Charles de Lint performed by Loretta Swit; ""Alfred"" by Lisa Goldstein performed by Jennifer Warnes; ""And the Angels Sing"" by Kate Wilhelm performed by Denise Crosby; ""Basileus"" by Robert Silverberg performed by Roscoe Lee Browne; ""The Man Who Loved the Faioli"" by Roger Zelazny performed by Tim Russ; ""All Vows"" by Esther M. Friesner performed by Terry Farrell; and ""Upon the Dull Earth"" by Philip K. Dick performed by Kevin McCarthy). If you're expecting Angel fantasies or light and airy angel stories you've come to the wrong place! These are stories firmly set in the fantasy genre that tell of encounters with other-worldly beings - not necessarily Angels!"
5,great purchase!,I read many reviews for this item and a lot mentioned prints in about 57 seconds but when I received my own I was more then happy with the 40 Sec prints and great quality of the photos.
3,Shoe Review,"It's a well-product and light weight shoe. I'm a 44-year-old casual runner (6-10 miles per week) and I've been pleased with past Reebok DMX running shoe purchases. Unfortunately, this model isn't providing me the cushion I've had in other Reebok shoes, ones that were $30 less in price. Perhaps it's the fit of this specific shoe on my feet, but I'm disappointed in the purchase, the first time I have after many purchases of Reebok running shoes. The bottom line is it's a good shoe but it's not turning out to be right for me."
3,Fun for a while,"My one year old initially liked this book a lot because of the scratch and sniff smells. When I first held up the smells of the different foods to him, you could see the surprise written on his face. But within a few days, his interest started to lag. This is a fun book for a young child, but don't expect it to hold their attention for long."
1,crap,"came and i was embarrased ro give it to my son, he loves the smell books but this was all stuck together like they had food on it"
5,My son LOVES this book!,"I actually picked this book up in a store when he was about 15 months old to occupy him. I quickly found that I would have to purchase the book. My son just wouldn't part with it. He learned how to ""sniff"" different things from using this book. He played with it so long and hard, he nearly destroyed it! He is 21 months now and still plays with the book daily. The smells are true to life and last well even under the worst abuse."
5,Good,"Using it as a backup for bypass fuel flow if my fuel filter on my boat gets clogged. I can stil run my boat into shore if it stops running due to a clogged fuel filter. Fits my hoses and isn't made out of brittle plastic that is susceptible to hot Texas heat, but moreover ethanol over time!"
3,Odd book - who is it aimed at?,"Couple of odd things about this book. First is Whitman's invention of acronyms to refer to simple concepts (such as minority investors) which makes the book more confusing to read than it needs to be. Bigger problem however is it is unclear to me who is supposed to read it. The first 200 pages are a rant against the efficient market hypothesis, investment banker fees and a couple of other topics interspersed with a basic overview of markets. Last 30 pages are an advanced discussion on distressed security investing (one of the author's many talents) and dividend policy.I was bored for 200 pages & interested for 30. Others would be the other way round. Very odd."
3,Decent,"This book has many good insights, but the writing isn't great, and it gets pretty technical at times. A better choice, especially for less sophisticated investors, is Kirk Kazanjian's ""Value Investing with the Masters,"" which features Whitman among a panel of 20 value gurus."
3,Good Overview,"Whitman's book offers a good introduction and overview of the issues and topics to pay attention to for value investors. He does a fairly good job explaining and clarifying his points. However, sometimes that is overdone and things seem quite repetitive. New value investors should definitely read it. My main disappointment is that there are not too many illustrations, in-depth examples or stories that would have made the book a more interesting and valuable read. This book has its place in today's ""pay anything for growth"" mentality."
2,"Some Good Points, when you can understand what he is Saying","Parts of this book are good. Whitman does say a few important ideas clearly, but a lot of what he writes is difficult for the lay reader to understand. Maybe you need to be a business major or have an MBA. Whitman does not clearly define alot of the basic terms he uses through the book. When he does give a definition, often the definition is obtuse, wordy and confusing. The tables of financial data and examples are pretty much impossible to follow. Some good ideas here, but I really had to force myself to finish it..."
4,strength training,This book will be very helpful in my strength training program while not leaving my house to do it.
2,"Journalism, not essays","These pieces do not earn the category ""essay"". They read like the journalism that they were. I watched Wallace a few nights ago in a 1990s Charlie Rose interview and felt connected to this bright young man. But he writes too casually, letting any thought get into the narrative. The endless digressions sap the energy of the text. I understand that his novels are that way too (i e endlessly digressive). How sad that he was unable to overcome his depression. Maybe he would have matured into a more disciplined writer."
1,Semi-Ugh (updated),"I gave this one star, but I should update it to 2. The essay that attracted me first was on English usage, but it seemed daunting to tackle it. But once I got into it, that alone lifted my rating slightly.The rest of my early review went like this and is somewhat the same (unless I revise it again!):I had contemplated getting a Wallace book for a couple of years. I found my way there in part because of Amazon cross-reference suggestions and such (""people who bought this also bought THIS, etc.) and then I checked into it ... from what I read, his subject matter and writing style seemed up my alley.Maybe this was the wrong book to take the plunge, so I won't paint all his work with the same brush. But I found myself paging through this book, trying to find a good starting point. The Updike chapter was mildly interesting, but otherwise .... zzzzzz.I'm not wasting any more time trying with this one."
5,"Get out the dictionary, kids!","I bought ""Consider the Lobster"" because I wanted a little taste of David Foster Wallace's style before deciding whether or not to invest the countless hours it would take to read his most famous monster of a novel ""Infinite Jest"". Wallace has sold me! Very smart writing on topics the average person doesn't necessarily stop to consider (as the title might imply). Just so you know, because it certainly surprised me, there are some very scholarly essays (there's a huge one about American Usage (language, grammar), for example, as well as one about Dostoyevsky... you get the idea) included in the anthology. If you have the discipline to get through them, though, they make some very interesting points and show the amazing range of what Wallace can do (which as far as I can tell, is just about anything.)"
5,good read,My nephew who is 15 really liked this book. He had read before but had been wanting his own copy. My neice who is 17 suggested it to him.
3,Not as Good as Most People Think (Still Not Bad),"I don't get all the 5 star, Wallace loving reviews here. This really isn't spectacular. There are some 5 star essays in the book (Big Red Son, Host). Also some one star ones that are just awful and tedious to read.Who wants to read 75 pages about his views on language usage. Maybe if your a linguistics major. The tour diary from travelling with McCain loses it's drive halfway through.Good, but not his best. Start w/ ""Infinite Jest"" and take it from there."
2,Self-Indulgent,"Footnotes with footnotes? Really? I'm all for the fifty-cent word, but Wallace seems a little too infatuated with himself. I was thoroughly unimpressed. Occasionally insightful observations are dwarfed by excessive pontificating and obscure references."
3,Missing one key piece...,"DFW's content is not the object of this review. Rather, I am reviewing (and objecting to) the Kindle version of the book, which does not include the marvelous essay, ""Host."" Although I (now) understand that the article in its original form used sidenotes that cannot be duplicated in the eBook format, it would have been nice to know that before hunting through the publication notes on my Kindle to discover this. It seems that either the sidenotes could be changed to footnotes and so duplicated, or the publisher and Amazon could let me know that what I am buying is a somewhat diminished version of the book."
2,Smart kid seeks validation with 'in' crowd,"So sixty-nine of you (out of 84) gave this four to five stars? Relentlessly jocular (you can almost see the sweat), doggedly ingratiating (will you be my friend?), grimly populist (I'm smart but I'm just like you really), excruciatingly condescending (and I'm only doing it for the money), shockingly trivial (the fact that these were commissioned, from a variety of publications - Gourmet, Premiere, Rolling Stone - is no excuse), often poorly written (people's phonecalls on 9/11 not making *rational* sense was a nadir - what other kind of sense is there, exactly? - but he seems to think slackness is a virtue), crassly and unfairly offensive (Mrs Thompson; Tracy Austin), often interminable (Authority and American Usage; Up, Simba) - so what's to like? Trite, smug and - as we now know - desperate; I cringed even as my heart went out to him"
2,Very Abridged CD Version,"My rating and review are specific to the abridged CD audio version. Be alert that it contains only four of the, I believe, ten essays of the text version - a fact I wish I had been aware of before making this my first daily commute audio book purchase."
4,Excellent (As Always),"This collection is another excellent compendium of DFW's essays. Some are brilliant, some are very very good, a few are merely filling up the book.But even the less-than-great pieces are still better than 99.8% of the work that's out there. DFW is word-for-word the only American writer in the same league with Thomas Pynchon.It is September 15, 2008. And I am very sad."
4,"It's about best practices, not a reference manual","I'll take one star off for somewhat careless editing that includes a few typos and some slightly misleading information, but this is a great book for what it is. If you possess a solid basic understanding of Windows and networking hardware, this book will help you set up a SBS 2000 network with confidence and skill. I think Harry's emphasis on ""best practices"" is worth the price of the book alone: he is a networking pro, with years of hard-won experience, which he shares freely in this book. His humour and unpretentious style are a bonus - certainly a refreshing change from the impersonal and alienating tone of most books in this field. I used this book to set up several SBS 2000 networks and found it helped me get the job done right. Actually, this edition is probably more complete and helpful than his best practices book on SBS 2003 (which leaves out some of the info in this edition - i.e., makes you go back to this edition to get the job done!)."
2,A book for beginners,"This book should have been titled ""Small Business Server 2000 for Dummies"" It is a good for for a novice business owner or manager to do the most basic setups of SBS 2000. However, if you are experienced with Windows NT/2000 Server, you will be disappointed, as this book covers some of the most basic features and functions and it does NOT show the best practices in real life small business networking situations.In short, this book is for beginners only and it doesn't deserve similar rating as Mark Minasi's outstanding Windows NT/2000 Server books."
3,Two Books?,"Maybe there are two books by Harry Brelsford with the same title. In the book I got Bob Clough, a marketing manager at Microsoft, wrote the forward to Mr. Brelsford's book. He was not a co-author. The book I got is not a 5 star book.This book needs an editor. There are many typos (what is a 3/18"" nut driver?) and Harry's good-old-boy prose is annoying. As proof of this I also bought Harry's ""MCSE Consulting Bible"" which was published by IDG Books. This book is well edited and Harry comes across as the smart and informed business man I'm sure he is. This is a 5 star book. What a difference an editor makes!""Small Business Server 2000 Best Practices"" is a book filled with tips and a few best practices by a man who has extensive experience installing small business server. I can recommend this book because of the great advice and despite the poor editing and high price."
1,Terrible DVD.Don't buy,I do not recommend this DVD. I already have reviewed it but my review was not published because it was honest.
4,"A fun, quick read...","This book had a superfluous murder, some anachronisms, and some cardboard characters. That being said, I thought it was great fun to read. I loved that Weezie was what she called ""a picker"" and what is known around my part of the country as ""a dealer."" As someone who loves a good auction or garage sale, I was delighted to read about her finds and her quest to find an item that would pay off big. Her best friend was quirky yet grounded. The murder was unnecessary, but who cares. It's fast and it's fun. Overlook the editing errors and just enjoy it."
4,"Fast, quirky, funny.........wonderful!!!","When Eloise, a struggling anitque picker, divorces her wealthy husband Tal and decides to live in the carriage house behind Tal and his girlfriend, Caroline, you know that the author has a quirky and wonderful story that will unfold page by page!!!Eloise sneaks into an old home where an estate auction is to be held and is found beside a murdered woman. She has motive and opportunity but claims innocence. While fighting to prove her story she relies on her Uncle who is about to reveal a family secret. On top of all this, Eloise' mother has a problem that will need the entire family to ""circle the wagons"" and help out.Mary Kay Andrews brings her delightful sense of humor and a delightful sense of timing to this fun, fast story that deals with some serious issues and yet never takes itself to seriously."
5,Pure Dee Fun!,"I loved, loved, loved this book! Such a fun, light, uplifting and riveting read! The characters were hilarious and very well-developed. In fact, I think I know more than one of those snooty b--ches!!! I enjoyed reading and learning about the intriguing world of antiques...and the murder plot was ingenious. It kept me guessing until the end. A delightful read that I very highly recommend. I'm looking forward to more from this wonderful Southern Belle!!!"
4,Entertaining,"I loved all the info about Savannah, plantations and of course, the food. The characters with unique and they all had their own funny quirks. BeBe's attitude and way of getting things done was admirable. The only problem I had was with Weezie's attitude with Daniel. It was obviously the guy was in love with her and she didn't treat him very well.Other than that I enjoyed the book."
4,Chick Lit Mystery,"It takes great skill to turn a chick lit piece into a fun mystery, but Mary Kay Andrews (Kathy Trocheck) has managed it with SAVANNAH BLUES. Yes, the plot and the characters are silly, but then they were meant to be.Just the book to enjoy and laugh with the antics of the characters.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
5,Hilarious!!,"Great southern humor with strong women, a kooky family, a sexy boy toy, and not a little intrigue. I was sorry when it ended. Can't wait for another book by this new author. As a southerner, I can always tell when the author isn't from the south. THis author's language is wonderful and her southern ""speak"" is hilarious without making you gag."
5,"IF YOU LOVE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW, YOU'LL LOVE THIS BOOK","If you love going to flea markets, yard sales, and browsing through antique stores, you'll devour this book. It's a fun mystery too, but the real hunt isn't for a killer...it's for the killer find, that piece of furniture you pick up... that turns out to be early American and worth 25,000, or the box lot that contains a treasure trove of jadite dishes in the bottom. And the city of Savannah is here too, with all its charm and drawbacks...but ah, who wouldn't leave Atlanta, as the author did, to write a mystery there. I can only hope this is the start of a series..."
4,A real original,"I genuinely enjoyed this book. It mixed believable characters, crime, antiques and a real, unique sense of place into a delicious stew. Eloise (Weezie) is a lovely, flawed heroine -- not at all Superwomen, but flesh and blood and very capable of making hysterical mistakes. Her relationships with family, friends, neighbors and men all ring true (eccentric, perhaps, but true nevertheless). The only reason that I subtracted a star is that I found it slow going in the beginning. I got a little impatient waiting for the action to really begin. Still, it was a great summer read."
3,Could have been better,"I really enjoyed this author's book Hissy Fit. So I decided to read this book also. It was an okay read, but I will not suggest it to any of my friends. It took me forever to read. I usually read a book within 2-3 days, but this book took me almost a month. I could not get into it, and I found myself deciding to do other things beside read my latest purchase. The author spends a lot of time detailing Weezie's ""finds."" I was not interested in the furniture, so I skipped paragraph after paragraph. I'm not sure if I'll read any of her other books."
