5,Double O Excitement,"One movie, one theme song, one legend. The Bond theme songs here are timeless, classic, each perfectly suited to the movie for which it was written. Yes, some were more popular than others, but they are all great songs.My favorites are ""We Have All the Time in the World,"" ""Live and Let Die,"" and the theme from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Of course, anytime Shirley Bassey sings a Bond theme is a special treat. This is a great CD on a long road trip. You'll find yourself singing along and dreaming of all those special automotive alterations that Q made.Whether you're a Bond movie fan or not, these songs stand out. They're simply wonderful."
4,Great But........,"A must for all James Bond fans. Has almost all the songs by the original artists. In my humble opinion they should have went a little further. They should have included: 007 theme from ""From Russia with Love"" and Dawn Raid at Fort Knox from ""Goldfinger"". Eventhough I still highly recomend this CD."
5,Awesome,"This jam packed CD offers bursting sound quality. Differences though, include all of the soundtracks except for the World is Not Enough. I would definitely recommend this product. An exceeding 5 star quality!"
2,Not For Me,"Some folks seem to be satisfied with this product but I was not. It is described as a ""Wide Angle - Panoramic - Macro - Fisheye Lens"" Well, in my opinion it is not wide angle or panoramic and as others have said it is not a true fisheye lens. [As for the macro part I didn't try that but I'm happy with the built in macro features on my camera.] I was looking for something to give me a really wide panoramic effect for landscape photography. This lens did not work for that. I had a lens in the past for a previous camera that did a great job but not this one. In fact it only slightly increased the wide angle view of my S3IS Canon before I began noticing dark corners in the frame. I returned it being more than happy to pay the return postage and the 15% restocking fee."
2,Basically a novelty item,"For the price, one should not have great expectations. The lens is OK, but is pretty much a novelty item with a single application. My 2 stars is based on overall quality, versatility, and use. I did keep mine, but will use it only very occasionally. It's not a ""real"" fish eye."
2,watchable but forgettable.,"Rail Kings revolves around the quest by a rich man's feckless son who suspected of the murder of his parents, escapes justice by riding the rails as a hobo to seek the real murderer. He experiences the lifestyle and company of the various hobo jungles, love interest, robbery and murder along the way. Good box car scenery apart, this is a B movie special rather than an A train ride, with no name actors apart from a cameo appearance by Ernest Borgine of the incomparable hobo movie `Emperor of the North'. There are grounds here for a more engaging road/train movie to break out, beyond its otherwise base banality and disjointed direction. I watched Rail Kings via computor download, so I can't comment on the DVD format. To conclude: watchable but forgettable."
2,Disappointed,"The book started out OK, then just died. I really like her Maclain series, but not this one. I liked the two main characters, but the plot went off in tangents all over the place. I also didn't like the sister (Jamie). The ending felt like it was rushed, and to make it worse, the author takes the hero's friend and gives (marries) him off to the sister. He deserves better. I was hoping Ms. Thomas would give him his own story, but maybe it's for the best, I'd hate to be disappointed twice."
4,Surprising Twists,"Once you start reading it's hard to put this book down. The story is unusual. A women, Kora, agreeing to marry a man, Winter, she just met, hence she gets 20 acres on a Texas ranch with a home, (part of his inheritance.) Kora is a poor woman, who needs a home and food; she is caring for her younger sister, who is a zany character to say the least, and her brother who is mentally scarred from war. Winter is a man of good character, his ranch is thriving, but under attack, but they are not sure from who. The characters are intriging, and the story takes many unexpected twists and turns. There is humor threaded throughout, and of course romance. It was a good mixture of fun and mystery and romance."
3,A little disappointing,"I was really prepared to love this book after reading all of the favorable reviews. It had some good parts but overall it wasnt as good as I was hoping. The main charactors left me a little puzzled at times, such as (not to ruin the story for those who havent read it yet) when Kora is finally safe after a dangerous situation, Winter locks himself in the study without a word to her? Even though he has his struggles, I think he would at least show some concern or interest in her welfare. That would have moved the romance along. And then you have Kora who seems overly submissive in scene after scene. I found myself more interested in who her sister would end up with."
4,Two Texas Hearts,The main characters are likable. There's plenty of action. It's funny and hard to put down. The only down side to this book is that it was difficult keeping track of time. There was little to distinguish one day from the next and day from night. I often found myself struggling with the time line.
2,Not a perfect vacuum,"This vacuum has its pros and cons. PROS: (1) extremely good suction; (2) easy to empty dust cup; (3) good-lengthed cord; (4) inexpensive. CONS: (3) hard to push, despite the ""ultra swivel"" wheels; (2) cord coating isn't tough enough (the first time I used it it got caught around and under the leg of our easy chair and when I was pulling it out, it stripped the black coating off the cord in a couple spots!); (3) hose storage is insecure, so the hose keeps poking out while you are vacuuming (minor annoyance)."
4,Dirt Devil Vacuum,This Vacuum picks up GREAT. It delivered promptly and the price can't be beat. My only drawback is that is does not GLIDE smoothly as The name would indicate. I have a grandson that is learning to walk so it is VERY important to me that the carpet he is ALL over is clean and I recomend this vacuum highly on cleaning. I also have a seven year old granddaughter with MANY alergies so again controlling the dirt and dust is my main concern. If you don't mind the noise (not much worse than any vacuum) and can handle pushing a little harder than most it is a GREAT DEAL.
4,Good vacuum for the price,The only thing I would say is very annoying about this vacuum is the fact that you have to shake the filter off after every time you use it. The filter makes a big cloud of dust. I wish I would have known this first.It does have GREAT suction.
2,No Screws,"Recvd the product in a timely matter. After a couple of days open up the box and discovered there were no screws. Called Dirt Devil and was told the screws would be shipped, after a week still no screws. Called again and was told there was no record of my previous call requesting screws. So again I requested screws, by now it's week 2. I returned the vacuum cleaner. The screws showed up three weeks later. Don't know if the vacuum cleaner worked or not. That's my only regret."
2,not that a great vacuum,"My friend gave me this vacuum when she moved out of the country. I was quite excited when I got it since it looked very nice. I found it really hard to glide on the carpet with the swivel wheels. It didn't even pick up the cereals dropped on the carpet, which is a standard way to test how good a vacuum is. I will suggest people to buy Hoover vaccum with the same price."
4,Mostly a good vacuum,"This vacuum was a great purchase. The price was exceptional. It works great. The only down fall is the manual change from main carpet to hose. You have to pull out the hose from suction hole, get the hose put it in there and twist to lock.Otherwise I am very happy!"
1,Run for your life,"This vacuum is a nightmare to clean. You may as well use your nose to pick up all the dirt, dog hair and other denizens on your floors and carpets because that is where it will reside once you start to clean this vacuum. It should come with a warning--people who are allergic to dust, dust mites, and animal hair beware!Dirt Devil 085805 Ultra Swivel Glide Bagless Vacuum"
1,worst of the worst!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,This is the most vile piece of junk!I had to put 1 star but it is negative stars in my opinion
4,"Boy, this baby sucks!!!","The one and two star reviews are really unfair. This is probably the most effective vacuum machine in its class. It has its faults: it is loud, heavy, the cord is annoying, and I wish it had more hose, but I've owned about 5 VCs and none compare to this one's ability to suck dirt, and especially dog hair, out of carpet. I initially did not like this machine because of the noise (it is still loud), so I had to buy the highly rated Eureka Smart 4870DT which now sits in the corner collecting dust, because it is a true dog compared to this baby."
3,More than one person got mugged --,"This frothy piece should have been titled 'Women Obsessed with Style,' for surely the book had no substance. Bradford's original 'Woman of Substance' remains a timeless clasic, but her third generation twit offspring are less than inspiring. Most troubling to me, less than 6 pages from the end - what was the red herring mugging? A few hundred words later, why did evil Jonathan suddenly disappear? Obviously all that was a springboard to the next book, but where the heck was the ending of this one? Bradford seems to have committed the same faux pas with her readers as politicians often do with their constituents: she lost respect for our intelligence."
2,Disappointed,"This was my first Barbara Taylor Bradford book to read. I've heard great things about her books, but this one is very disappointing. I'm over half way through the book, but I don't think I will be able to finish it. There are so many characters that I can't keep up with who's who! Also her writing seems more like ""filler"" than actual fiction. I'm afraid I can't recommend this book to anyone."
5,I'm reading the books out of order..,"I read this one first! I loved it, and how tight the families were was a great story line. In this book Bradford puts a family tree of the Harte Clan which comes in very handy no matter which one of the books you're reading. Definitely on my Best Of Books of the year."
2,Yawn,"A cliche ridden melodrama. The dialogue is predictable and wooden; the characters are stiff renditions of type casting. How many times does she use the phrase, ""Bred in the bone?"" Or how about saying a flatterer has kissed the Blarney stone? Oh puhleeze! The quality of prose is on the same level as any pulpy bodice ripper."
1,Disappointed,I had high expectations for this book because I have listened to other Bradford books. This was a total waste of my money. There were too many characters to follow and too many details about them. I was so confused with all of the characters that I never really understood the story. Very disappointing.
2,Cleverly disappointing,"When I first read the 'family tree', I was scared I wouldn't be able to follow all the characters. However, Bradford effortlessly leads you through the meandering storylines of several different characters - and not once did I get lost! Emma's' Secret is definitely a page-turner, yet I feel Bradford went off on a few 'filler' tangents. Instead, I wish she focused on an ending that would have satiated all the readers who devoured this beautiful story as quickly as I did. I know its probably more advantageous to Bradford to leave the story `open' for her next novel, but the cliffhanger was disappointing to say the least! The ending definitely makes me wonder what will happen to the characters. However, I feel cheated - its almost as if I read the book for nothing! Honestly, the ending was way too blunt and it made me realize that Bradford is just another greedy saga author looking to rope readers into buy her next book."
1,End of an Era,"I enjoyed Emma Harte so much that I have been compelled to follow the stories of her offspring. I was incredibly disappointed to read Bradford's description of Evan's mother who struggles with bipolar illness. Her perspective of this condition is extremely negative and shows very little comprehension of the illness. Because of this glaring incongruity, it would be a real strain for me to continue to accept Bradford's credibililty. What else has she presented in a totally skewed manner? My reading of Bradford novels has come to an end."
2,A Woman of Substance it isn't,"I read ""A Woman Of Substance"" about 20 years ago, and LOVED It. When I read that there was a new book in the series, I was thrilled. But let me say that ""Emma's Secret"" is NOT on the same level as the first book!This book starts out with a death of a woman and the request to her granddaughter to find Emma Harte. So off the England the reader goes where they meet the newest generation of the Harte family who frankly lead soap opera lives. About 3/4 in the book the reader finds themshelves in War-Time London with Emma Harte, who has seem to lost her fire since reading the first book. Then after only a few chapters we are back with the young people for the secret to be known to all.This book was not good at all in my opinion. It didn't not need to be written. The only reason that I gave the book two stars were for the war-time chapters. In truth, Ms. Bradford should had let the Harte family go out on the hight note."
4,A terrific follow-up,"Emma's Secret is a terrific follow-up to The Woman of Substance series, and in some respects it's like checking in with old friends or with family that you have lost contact with. Set some thirty years after the death of matriarch Emma Harte, we are introduced to the clan's newest generation, and discover a long buried secret from a previously untold chapter in the Emma Harte saga.My only disappointment with the story was with the treacherous family scion, Jonathan Ainsley. Reading, I was led to believe that this sociopath was hatching some truly murderous revenge against the family that just never seemed to fully materialize.Well, perhaps in the next installment...."
3,"Enough, already","I have read all of Barbara Taylor Bradford's books. They have ranged from wonderful to mediocre.One of the best books, in my opinion was her first -- ""A Woman of Substance."" She wrote, in great detail and meticulously researched, of Emma Harte, a poor servant girl who rose to become one of the world's richest women. The story was spell-binding and I loved it!However, she has milked Emma's story with three sequels, each of which tells of Emma's descendants and extended family, and each of which is less compelling than the previous. They are watered-down versions, none of which have the power or interest of the original.Although she's probably made millions by doing this, I think Ms. Bradford should have stopped with the first. I think the three sequels have deteriorated an extraordinary story."
1,The secret is there is no story,Any book that cannot stand on it's own should not be written. I found the characters totally confusing. They suddenly appear and it is presumed the reader knows who they are and their relationship to each other. I quit in the middle due to complete frustration.
1,The secret is there is no story,Any book that cannot stand on it's own should not be written. I found the characters totally confusing. They suddenly appeared and the reader is presumed to know who they are. I quit in the middle due to complete frustration.
1,Confusing and disappointing,Emma's secret was a terrible disappointment.. I have read all her previous books and inspite of that found it difficult to keep track of the vast cast of characters.. I had to frequently refer to her index. Finally the book just fizzled out. After hinting at some devious plot being laid by the villain he just upped and pushed off to HongKong. As one reviewer said this is probable a precursor to the next book. However it was highly disappointing. I did not expect BTB to do this to her readers.
2,Very disappointing,"I read the three books by BTB starting with A Woman of Substance and loved every one of them. Wonderful books with great stories and characters. I was very excited to read Emma's Secret. It was probably one of the worst books I have ever read. Please, don't bother with it! It is very poorly written. Characters tend to speak in a way that no normal person EVER would. I found that nothing really happened in the book until the last few pages. Even then, she leaves you dangling and lets you know at the end that more books are coming. I found that Emma's Secret was just a ""filler"" book to get to her others that are coming. It traps you in! Too bad - I wish she had put more thought in to continuing this series."
3,Emma's Secret,I could guess the ending from the start. However I was still pleased with it when it came and would have enjoyed a sequel.
3,Title is deceving but generally good,"We bought this book for the photos week by week. Instead, it is 4 weeks by 4 weeks and there are not enough unborn baby photos that we expected. Most of the unborn baby photos only cover the first half of the book. There aren't enough information based on week by week. She instead summarizes the whole 4 weeks.There are some new age or mystical info. She talks about mother-baby communication via hormones and via psychic. She talks about baby dreams.At 23 weeks, she says baby may cry with sound. But the baby can't cry with sound since there is no air inside his or her lungs.She address the baby as an ""IT"" during early stages then calls the baby as she/he or his/hers. We don't like the way most baby books address unborn babies as ""IT'S"". That baby is a child with personality - an unborn human being. It could also be the fault of the English language having no neutered gender.The best way is to see any book personally first before buying it."
3,Good Amount of Information but a Bit Confusing,"This book is chock full of information that I have not seen elsewhere. The photo illustrations are also pretty good. However, it's difficult from page to page to determine if they are basing the information on the embryo/fetus' development from the date of conception or from the Last Menstrual Period(LMP). Every time I thought I had it figured out, they threw in another curve. This can be a bit confusing because the 2 weeks differential can make a world of difference in tracking the rapid growth and change of my future baby."
3,Great Book,I found this book to be very useful. A lot of great pics also. I would recommend this book to anyone who is pregnant.
4,What Perceived Mountain Do You Allow to Limit You,"Using the challenges of climbing Mt. Everest as a metaphor for how we make lasting breakthroughs in our lives is excellent.I chose this book because I was looking for something that I hadn't already read, to guide me to focus upon unconscious limitations that need to face.Ten pages into this book, I've identified and continue to work on those limitations, as I shared the detailed challenges of the authors of this book.The one thing that I would have liked to have seen, with this book, that was not here is photographs that detail key points about their trip. I kept having to ask myself, ""What does that look like? Where are they now?""As a motivational book; however, this is an excellent tool."
3,Self reflection,"Jamie and Alan found out more about themselves on that mountian then they ever would have imagined. Some of it was bad, but most of it seemed to be positive. They learned that it's not necessarily the summit that makes you succeed but the path you take to get there. It had me almost in tears at times and I was surprised that it had the power and appeal to do that. If you stories of hope then this is for you."
3,SHould have been better,"Outside of ""In This Country"", ""My Neighborhood"" version A & B and ""When Will The World Be Like Lovers"". The rest of the album is a waste of time. His first and third (latest) albums are far superior. Give up the social commentary Robert!"
3,Lamm's lyrical style,"This cd features Robert's ability to write songs about daily life situations. From the title track, to All The Years, Murder On Me, When Will The World Be Like Lovers, the music and lyrics blend very well together."
3,A pleasant surprise not on the Top 40,"Robert Lamm's most recent solo work is not bad. It doesn't match up to his best writing during the early 70's with Chicago, but not much else does. The best tracks here are ""All The Years"", which was written for an unreleased Chicago album, ""My Neighborhood, Version A"", written for his birthplace of Brooklyn, and ""In This Country"", another song rooted in today's social commentary of the times. ""Life"" would be a good addition to your CD collection."
2,"so, so...","This book was informative, but it is limited to ""on the road"". You'll hear about the bush taxis and their drivers, but will visit only a small part of the country. This book could have used a good editor -- there's some repetition -- and a better map. The map in the front of the book doesn't list all the towns, villages, etc. that were visited and doesn't name the adjacent countries. I thought it was worth reading, but disappointing."
1,More Colonial Nonsense,"What most reviewers of ""Riding the Demon"" miss is the way in which the author metaphorizes Africa for his own ""literary"" ends. As non-Africans have done now for centuries, Chilson translates ""Africa"" into a useful tool for his own soul-searching-and pontificating. While in some respects the book may open western eyes to the complex that is ""Africa,"" ultimately Chilson bends ""Africa"" to his purposes and authorial desires."
5,Excellent book,"Book has bundles of information about working in the print or the web design world. Has theory and abundant, little found, coverage of practical professional designer issues. Presented in two page semi-independent modules."
3,Great voice and lousy selections,"Brian Lane Green has a beautiful, exquisite voice. I especially love his version of ''More Than This,'' but he loses points with me by doing overdone cabaret songs like ''Flight'' and ''Grateful.'' I also find the CD too ballad-heavy; it would be fun to hear him do a couple of uptempos. Some of the songs sound too much alike. I hope Brian's next CD features more material that's worthy of his excellent instrument."
4,"""Candlebox"" an intriguing band name!!","Candlebox is a band that seems to not become as popular as Alanis Morisette and Madonna (the woman that gave this band to be the first band to sign up for Maverick/Warner records). This album however gave grunge alternative rock to become as intriguing as Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots and Alice In Chains. This band had a bit of success before Alanis Morisette was even heard of. My favourite songs on this album is ""Change"", ""Rain"" and ""He Calls Home""."
4,Honest Music !!!,"You can say whatever you want about Candlebox but they sure can put together nice tunes. There's always a time when you just want to hear music that makes you feel nice, no need for top acts or ultra long-brilliant solos by some master musician. Here's where Candlebox come into the spotlight, music without commitments. There are a lot of great tracks in there, just look for them..."
3,"CD WAS OK, BUT LIVE THEY DROP","Hey, I am not on the candlebox bandwagon. The first Candlebox CD i owned for a couple of years before I even listed to it. But after I saw them live, I couldn't stop. They are an excellent band to see live...Candlebox pours out the jams and the lyrics will hit you like the Terminator."
5,Classic!,"This is a must have CD. I love every song on this disc.Every track has it's own identity with great lyrics,guitar, and drum work. Since it's release I can always put this on and listen to it over and over. I never get tired of it. whenever I'm feeling down I put this on and I feel great again. I can't really explain it! Every song is great on here. Although I think ""Rain"" is my favorite. I especially love the blues side to this track. If you like rock with a bit of a blues side to it then this is for you!"
1,Among the worst of the 90's,"A bunch of hair metal rejects who decided to try their luck at ""alternative"". Horrible, monotone singing with that cheesy fake 90's twang (that is somehow still selling records for Creed and Matchbox 20, who stink also). Weak, weak guitar solos. TERRIBLE lyrics. ""Now may-ya-ya-ya-baya, i did-own me-yown to treat you ow so bayad, but I did anyway!"" Are you kidding me? People bought this? People give this 5 STARS!?Anyone who gives this group a positive review is certifiably clueless."
4,Great Cd,I've had this cd for years and it still manages to find its way into my stereo time and time again. This is by far the best cd Candlebox ever put out!
3,Candlebox,"This is a band that didn't quite make it big, perhaps like many suspected that they should. This CD is a good cd, nonetheless. Tracks 3-6 are excellent. However, there is a distinct sameness to all of their songs. Listeners may tire of hearing, what seems like, one continuous song. Yes, I love certain songs, and yes, if you are a serious music collector you need this CD. All in all, though, I wish the lyrics didn't always blend in to one long sentence. The lead singer reminds me of the lead singer of CREED. (maybe that's just my ears)."
3,It's good but not that good,"Let's face up to reality here... Candlebox are good at what they do and this is their most consistent work, but its nothing new or exciting. There's bands out there with this same sound and better songs. Don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan and love their work but it's not Mozart. If you're into all that alternative circa 1994 you will adore this album, if not, well its your money..."
1,"Odd how time brings perspective, isn't it?","Gee, it's strange that, had this music service from amazon.com existed at the time that ""Candlebox"" was released, this page would be overflowing with 5 star reviews claiming ""THIS IS THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER MADE!!!!!"", like so many of the other cheap, two-bit rip off acts like Matchbox 20. It's good to see that time brings things back into perspective, and encouraging that second rate bands will dissappear as quickly as MTV removes them from their ""Heavy Rotation"" set list. In the meantime, the bands that they ripped off are still going strong. I for one am relieved that I will probably never hear ""Far Behind"" again."
2,"If you didn't waste your money then, don't now","Sometimes 10 years can go by and music can get better with age. Not the case here. The band could play a little, but the song writing, lyrics, and the overall sound is piss poor. It was almost like a combination between Pearl Jam and Poison, without the fun of Poison and the Voice of Pearl Jam. The things that gets me today was how these guys sold any records, but that is not important now. If you are looking for a good early 90'd alt rock record, pick up some Soundgarden. If you are looking for a more talented band from the same era, check out Dream Theater's Awake."
4,Great beginners Album to 90's music,"I really like this album. Some of their music blends the sound of Seattle and the sound of moody Jazz. ""Don't You"" is a good opening song, I like the stop and go rhythm section. ""You"" is a song that starts off slow, but then builds up its momentum. ""Cover Me"" is your typical alternative ballad song mixed between acoustic and electric guitar sound. The highlight of the album is ""Far Behind"" which I think was the first single to be released from this album. As I remember this song was played on a heavy rotation on the radio and on MTV. It has this very unique 90's synthesizer sound that I find very amusing. ""Far Behind"" is a song dedicated to the late Andrew Wood, one of the chief pioneers of the Seattle rock sound in the early 80's.This is a great beginners album to anybody who has interest in listening to early/mid-90's alternative music or anybody who wants to get into the habit listening to this stuff."
3,Average Fare At Best,"Candlebox made it's mark on the history of alternative music of the 1990's, then faded away. While they had enough potential to grab the attention of the public, and a major record label, they had little staying power at a time when other bands like them flooded the market. Soul Asylum, Gin Blossums, Blind Melon, all came to the same ending.""You"", ""Cover Me"", ""Far Behind"" and ""Change"" were the highlights of this recording, and they are the songs that speak for the band. Unfortunately, they had very little in the way of versitility and imagination, and pretty much speak for the band's entire career. All their eggs are here in this one basket.If you like Candlebox, you might not agree with me. But the general record buying public spoke loudly when ""Lucy"", Candlebox's sophmore CD, went straight to the bargain bins. If you want the best of what represents Candlebox, you are best to stick to this CD and leave it at that."
4,Very underrated indeed,"Candlebox appeared on the music scene in 1993 and made a few albums before disappearing into obscurity. That's too bad, since they are actually a really good rock band with a solid, 90's grunge sound. But this album doesn't stop at that. It does spread its wings a bit. One track has a bluesy feel to it, another track has a classic rock feel to it.Far Behind is probably the most well-known track on this CD, and arguably their most known track of all. It is a gem too, but it is definitely not the only good one.This disc can be hard to find in stores. I wasn't even looking for it, I had actually forgotten all about Candlebox until I stumbled upon this CD in the used bin of my local record store for $2. It is a bit scratched and there was no track listing provided, but I took a chance and got it anyway. I am certainly glad I did. I think any fans of 90's rock would be happy to stumble upon this one!"
2,Dissapointing,"Perhaps the most fascinating feature of this book is the order in which topics are presented. Students flit all the way through triangles, angles and intersecting lines before they learn that theorems and postulates have some importance. They go through half of the book (and presumably through half of the school year) before they encounter the concept of a mathematical proof. In fact, they already have been required to learn some proofs, but the book hasn't told them that this is what they are doing."
4,Mind meeting,a highly informed and elegant look inside the world of our minds. This is a work that adds to the classics on the subject and offers a slightly more sophisticated perspective than one would expect.Very interesting stuff.
2,"Read ""The Doors of Perception"" instead.","The greatest contributions in this book were just the native americans talking about what peyote meant to them, and why it should be legalized. The author, although more than qualified to write on the subject, has no passion or fire behind his writings and the essays seems to be written in a manner which Mr. Smith's extensive vocabulary is showcased over the much more exciting power of the entheogens. If you haven't read Aldous Huxley's masterpieces ""The Doors of Perception"" and ""Heaven & Hell"" read them instead. If you have read those already, you will not learn anything new here."
4,Helpful identification of common Hawaiian floral plants...,"Hawaii: A Floral Paradise is an interestingly titled book. Many of the species photographed and discussed are alien species, and some are even considered invasive. Hawaii is indeed a paradise for growing these colorful and fragrant plants, but that means almost anything will grow in this paradise.Many nice photos, with a brief description of the plants. However, photographer Douglas Peebles sometimes used shots of flowers and plants when a macro lens would have allowed the reader to view the intricacy of the flower's structure in greater detail (like that rainbow heliconia). In addition, for some (not all) photos, a studio shot excluding the material surrounding the plant could have been used to great effectiveness, for an alternative perspective.These comments reflect my tastes, of course, and perhaps are not held by other readers. Take a look at the book."
3,Great little signal generator for the money,"If you are looking for a inexpensive signal generator with out all the fancy gismos, this is it.I gave it three stars, but it does work, but there is no read out and you should use it with a scope or frequency counter. It is battery operated which is kind of nice, however if you are going to do any real electronic work, I would get a real signal generator. It is ok for what it does."
1,Not accurate,Took the tester to my doctor to compare reading and found the Panasonic wrist tester to be as much as 70% high in reading. Did 5 tests with 2 different nurses using standard cup. Returned the wrist tester.
4,Panasonic EW3032S wrist blood pressure monitor,I'm very satatisfied with the product. The price was right and the monitor does a great job. When readings are compared with a unit at the doctor's office they are very close.
4,easy reading.,The accuracy depends on some unpredicatable factors since eachtime you got different number. I am still trying to figure outhow to use it properly.The back cover is quite loose.easy reading and using.
1,Review is incomplete,"The CS review presented a problem but no solution: Did CS return the item and try another?As an engineer I note that the ""Engineer"" reviewer mentioned ""repeatability"" which indicates the writer is really an engineer!While the CS review reports no useful technical data to support the CS evaluation.Lorenzo"
4,More Theatre Than Ballroom,"By my reckoning, only nine of the many sides recorded by Debroy Somers' Band have been reissued, so this compilation is a most welcome addition to the catalogue. Remastering and presentation are up to Living Era's usual high standard, and Dan Donovan takes the lion's share of the vocals. Somers made something of a speciality of medleys, four of which are included, and two are from West End shows, for at least one of which he had conducted the pit orchestra. In fact, overall these recordings are more evocative of the theatre than the ballroom, probably because that's where Somers concentrated his considerable energies. If your taste inclines in that direction then you will not be disappointed."
1,Its not original !,"It looks like somebody took the original bottle and refilled it with something . Ive been using Iceberg Twice for years so i can tell the diference right away. I am really disappointed . Yes, it was way too cheap to be the original - lesson learned . Don't buy it. And by the way I am pretty sure that 5 star feedback was posted by seller himself !Don't buy it."
1,"Adjustable Thigh Support, Captain Sports","The velcro closures and neoprene does not prevent the support from sliding down the leg when exercising, this happens even after tightening the closures."
2,Not Happy.,This product feels good as long as I sit still.When I stand up it slips down my leg no matter how tight I make it.Look for one that will stay up.
2,Thigh support,Very disappointed in the quality. After a few wearings started showing significant wear. Velcro straps do not secure the support when you want it tight and pulled up high on the thigh. I have been disappointed in the value received and have already made a replacement purchase.
3,Got me through a tough time,I used this a lot when I had a large contusion on my thigh. Other reviews are correct though about it not staying up. I used some safety pins which helped. After a while the velcro started losing its sticky.
4,This is Live CD to have.,"This is only truly representative live collection in Chicago's history. Including songs thru Chicago V, it is very representative of their live shows from that period, featuring Terry Kath's guitar prominently, and of course the Chicago Horns! Except for the band singing 2 songs in Japanese (Lowdown, Questions 67&68) this set doesn't miss a beat. Particulary good are Dialogue and Hit by Varese. If you want Chicago Live....get this one"
5,THE live Chicago album to buy,"Recorded when Chicago was still a cohesive unit (not Peter Cetera's back-up band), this album is far tighter, and has far better sound than the Carnegie Hall album.I bought this album in vinyl as a Japenese import in the late 70's. I never thought it would make it to CD. When it did, I scooped it up. If you like the sound of Chicago at their peak, then THIS is the album to buy."
5,The ultimate live album.....,"With the release of the re-mastered Carnegie Hall album just around the corner, I have to say this is still the ultimateChicago Live album. I remember seeing Chicago a couple of months before this album was recorded. I guess you will notice how Saturday in the Park was never introduced. They performed it that way the night I saw them and for weeks I told my friends that they played a new song that night that was awesome.When they asked me what was the title...I said something like ..The 4th of July..Duhhh.."
5,Murder By Mousse...,"""Murder on a Bad Hair Day"" continues the adventures of siblings Patricia Anne (petite, practical, retired schoolteacher, married for 40 yrs.) and Mary Alice (250+, loud, brassy, has buried 3 husbands and always on the lookout for the 4th).This series is one of the funniest to come along in years! It is especially great for older individuals who have children and grandchildren (although I have none).A beautiful former student of Patricia Anne's shows up on her doorstep following the ""murder by mousse"" of an ill-liked gallery owner. More murders follow and Patricia Anne and Mary Alice along with Detective Bo Peep work to solve the crimes.The plot is great, but buy this book (buy the whole series!) for the dialogue alone. The sibling bantering is hilarious!"
2,Murder on a Bad Hair Day.,"The book was shallow and the plot was unrealistic; therefore, I can't even recommend it for light entertainment. It was an easy read, but will not read any more of the series. It would probably be interesting for pre-teens. The only interesting factor was the landmark of city whose location is near where I live."
4,"Fun, fast read!","Fun story about a retired teacher who gets involved in solving a murder. I love her family and I love reading about her relationship with her sister and her husband. It's a light, easy read!"
4,Can a Bad Hair Day Kill You?,"This is the second in the series about Southern sisters Patricia Anne and Mary Alice. I fyou like cute cozy mysteries you will probably enjoy this novel by Anne George.Murder on a Bad Hair day finds the sisters at an art show where a cast of characters are introduced. The next morning, the owner of the gallery is found dead. Although the sisters try to stay out of it initially, they get swept up in the investigation and maybe even a little too close to the killer.I thought this one was better than the first one (Murder on a Girls Night Out). I thought Murder on a Bad Hair Day was funnier and more entertaining. After finishing, I immediately purchased and began reading Murder Runs in the Family."
4,Relaxing reading,Funny and intersting sisters entertain as always. JUst a nice little mystery that is a great quick read before bed especially.
3,This story was a little too...,"Could have been a great plot, but the story got muddled along the way. Too much of one character (the more practical sister) and too much repetitiveness about her daily domestic activities. Also, too much of a rushed and forced ending. It was on the high side of so-so."
3,Sister pull up a chair,While I didn't enjoy this as much as the first book in the series I still liked reading about this pair of Southern sisters. I like the combo of down-home life and good old-fashioned nosiness. The sisters are a hoot & a nice light read. I have gotten the whole series and plan to read them all!
4,I'm Hooked!,"I have always been a big fan of Southern writers; Conroy, Samms, Edgarton, Burns, and of course Mitchell to name a few. And now I have a new name to add to the list: Anne George. Her books are just precious and her characters are lovable! As I have previously stated, since I live in Alabama, I especially enjoy all the references to the Birmingham landmarks. When I read about highway 280, the Vulcan and the Galleria I feel that I am part of the story. Speaking of the story, I loved it. The writing is crisp, the dialogue forceful, and the plot is scrumptious! If you want a great book that will grasp you on the first page and is effortless to follow, get a copy of Murder on a Bad Hair Day: A Southern Sisters Mystery--you won't regret it!"
3,More fun with Patricia Ann and Mary Alice,"This is the second book in the ""Southern Sisters"" series -- which looks to be a series that's worth reading in order. (Murder on a Girl's Night Out is the first in the series.) Once again, being sixty-something and retired in Alabama is looking to be lots of fun and a little bit dangerous.This time the sisters get involved in a death at an art gallery featuring ""outsider"" art (think quilts, primitive oils, etc.) The book is strong on humor, sisterly chat (and teasing), winter in Birmingham and teacher love. The mystery is pretty weak -- particularly the conclusion which both comes out of nowhere and is way too convenient.Bottom line -- a fun, light read of the cozy kind. As another reviewer mentioned about Anne George, it's nice to find an author that you can recommend to your senior citizen mother."
3,A Very Funny Story,"I love eccentric characters in mysteries, and these two gals are the epitomy of eccentricity. Two southern belle sisters in their sixties, and oh so ""southern"". The characterization in this book is extremely good, and the two old gals are wonderful. Unfortuantely, I didn't find the story line as good. There are some pretty big holes in this plot, and the last part of the story, or the denouement made no sense, but I still enjoyed the book because of the characters, and because of the setting. I think I will give Ms.George another try. It's definately fine for light reading."
1,"Bad Style, No Substance",Lighter than air plot and prose. Definitely a book written for lighter than airheads.
2,Weird book.. clay modeling anyone,"Hi This was one of the few books that was available as indian edition and I must say what a dissapointment.The authors teaching style is clear but he loses focus and tries to teach clay modeling with scissors,steel clips,cutting plier ..what a shocker. There are other resources like kenny coopers videos that is way way better than this one."
2,"The ""Creature-from-the-Swamp"" book","Simple Test: Click on the front cover image to enlarge it. Look at the ""creature"" there looking back at you. Look deep into its eyes, and then at its claws, face, skin, legs... the menacing figurine of destruction. Now think of Godzilla (example). Or a rampaging T-Rex, ILM style. What do you think the rest of 'Maya Feature Creature Creations' is going to be like with a clown-creature on its cover?"
1,Plastic Surgery Secrets,"lots of misinformation in this book, questions need reworking as well as answers. Inconsistent with board or In Service exams."
5,Great study for kids,"I am working through this study with my 9 year old. He loves learning about Revelation, and I do too. He has had some fears over the end of the world, and my hope is that this study will help him trust God, and not fear."
5,wow,"This was my first book encounter with Andy Goldsworthy and wow- his art ideas are great. I love how he uses nature in his art- and even more so, how the changes in nature are art themselves."
2,Probably not a bad idea in 1996,"Had a been there, done that feel.... The plucky heroine, falsely accused man, etc. Rescued animals, evil blackmailers, nasty ex-mistress. Maybe some books just shouldn't be reissued."
2,Recycled Plot,"For the most part I enjoy Candace Camp's books. But I am getting tired of her recycled plots. There is the heroine who is in danger. There is the hero who will rescue her. The hero tells her to stay put so she will stay out of danger. But, she ignores him either because she's not going let him tell her what to do or just because she's a twit. She leaves the house with someone she thinks is a friend. Of course that person turns out to be the villain. Well, if she isn't captured the hero can't rescue her. But I wish Ms. Camp would find a more creative way of getting the heroine into trouble rather than recycling the same plot."
4,Suddenly,"Like some reviewers have said, this book has a deja vu feeling. The plot isn't anything unique, but the relationship is very steamy and seductive. I didn't think the book was bad or boring, just predictable and too detailed. Some parts were better than others, and I really loved them. But others were obvious and expecting. Sometimes a character would go on for a looooonnngg paragraph describing what had already been inferred by the reader. But I liked the chemistry between Charity and Simon. I admit, Charity was a little oblivious to things though."
1,If only I Could...,I liked the beginning. I thought I would love the book. The main character Charity seemed like a good character to like...however...Charity was a child. She acted like a child through out what I read of the book. She believed too much and missed too much. I'm sure she was a good character and while I do not mind when an author makes one of the characters a great deal younger then the other I cant finish the book if the heroine is so innocent in everything. It feels wrong to me and so before I barely started the book I stopped reading it.It might have been a good read for some people but I couldn't do it and I wish I had not bought it.
1,Very unlikable characters,"After reading The Courtship Dance, I was trilled to see that Candance Camp has published a new book. Let me say that although the story begins with so much promise, I got annoyed 1/3 into it. Initially, I liked Charity and how she enticed the duke to choose her instead of her sister, but then the story just turns ridiculous. When you see your fiance have a strong reaction towards another man, shouldn't you go see him and ask him why instead of continuing to frequent the man out of a sense of not letting him control you. On the one side, she promised to be the perfect wife for him and on the other side, she ignores his feelings. I didn't even bother to continue reading the book and choosing instead of skipping to the end. This book was a complete waste of money. I could barely stand Charity due to her immature behavior in the book and the mystery plot drags on until the end with only a couple of pages to tie it up."
2,romance or bad mystery - pick one,"When I buy a romance novel, that is what I generally look for. A good romance.Camp likes to add in blatantly unchallenging ""mysteries"" into her stories, where the reader has figured out who the ""murderer"" or ""mystery"" is long before the characters do. The characters seem to be intellient people, but she makes the antagonists so obvious, it's frustrating to keep reading. The love story itself is very good and enjoyable in this book, but the added ""mystery"" is distracting and takes away from the pleasure of the story. If Camp feels it necessary to clutter the plot with a weak mystery, she should work harder on making the ""mystery"" more captivating.Stick to the romance."
5,Just keeps getting better,"I enjoyed Henderson's blues albums, but this new one is a giant step forward in terms of sophistication, layering and just great playing. He's still ripping it up, but most of these tunes have two or more guitars layered, some affected vocals and judicious use of samples. Absolutely to die for guitar tones throughout. For those of you partial to the sound of overdriven tube amps on the verge of giving up the ghost, this CD is a certain delight!"
4,very cute and sexy shoe,"Although these shoes make u look hot, they are very high and can hurt your feet if you are not use to high-heels. ouch, beauty does hurts. The shoes are a very pretty brownish rosy color."
3,Low Quality film,"I'm not sure what year the movie was filmed in, but the quality of the film this DVD was made from was very poor.The acting and plot are very good. We enjoyed the movie and will probably watch it several times. It provides a good lesson for todays times. The kindness that Little Lord Fountleroy shows to others comes back to him many times over."
3,cook-book-ish,"It's Ok, but not all I (novice) had hoped for. It takes a lot of time to get through: tutorials are like tedious stories, every step is written down in a full sentence. This way it takes pages to do things that, looking back, aren't really that complex. And even then not every thing you're doing is explained. Also, not every story is told to the end!I'd like to see a more clear layout with theory and tutorials separated. If the chapters started out with bit of theory (with catchwords in the margin, also mentioning functions you don't need for the specific, follwing exercise)and the tutorials had shorter, clearer instructions (perhaps in a more steno or even graphic way) you would not only learn quicker; the book would also be more valuable as a reference book.Though: In the end you will master Viz. The writers do pay attention to explaining you why Viz 'does' things the way it does, the way Viz 'thinks'. That will turn out to be usefull."
1,Don't buy this book,"I bought this book thinking to improve my knowledge about VIZ, but that book is exacly the same 3D VIZ 3, with the same examples, etc."
3,Crack,"Loved that it got here extremely fast, however, there is a huge crack going across the front of the case."
3,Good single,"This is a pretty good song that should've been released awhile back.. It comes with 3 other decent Blink 182 songs, so if you're a Blink 182 fan you'll enjoy it."
4,Good,"The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I've heard all these songs before. I burnt I Won't Be Home For Christmas and some of my cds before so it's nothing new to me. Josie and Please Take Me Home are also good songs. Then, a great start for all the Small Things, it's a good cd. I recommend it. I Won't Be Home For Christmas, is a great song my favourite!"
5,This has been the best...,"This is absolutely the best investment for our new home we could have made! We have had it just short of 2 years and it has not only been an electricity saver, but also a marriage saver.... he likes it cool and I like it warm so we use it facing me in the winter and him in the summer and keep the house at higher temps in the summer and lower in the winter!!! Awesome!"
2,HUGE negative pressure,"Sucks air out and exhaust it outside. AKA barley takes air in threw intake, sucks some air from inside and exhaust it outside. You lose cold air since it don't recycle cold air. Told these are good and I see a split unit would be a better investment due to sucking cold air out."
3,Portable comfort,"It doesn't heat as much as it cools. Great product and it's easily programmable, but it takes extremely long to heat up a reasonable size room. Still a great product though."
1,save your money,"I have a 14000 BTU Portable AC Soleus Air LX-14010-1-2009 purchase date>The unit will not cool or heat>Start up for cool is 61 fan speed high, will not blow cool air>For heat set at 88 fan speed low unit does not blow warm air andcycles on and off every 3 min.,.We are not getting any error codes>Company will not provide any help nor will it sell or supply any parts.It's Trash??????Hank"
1,"Soleus Air PE2-10R-32 portable 10,000 BTU","I bought this unit from Sears less than a year ago. I stopped cooling, just blows warm air. I asked Sears for help and they said it was still in warranty but they don't handle it.I emailed Soleus and they asked me if it was plugged into a wall socket or surge protector. When I told them it was plugged into a surge protector they said it has to be plugged directly into a wall socket and that the literature is clear about that. I checked the literature and sure enough, in the installation instructions it says to plug the unit into an ""electrical outlet"". It doesn't say how to do that or what not to use. It gives no hint whatsoever that the warranty can be invalidated if you plug it in wrong. I think you would have to be a real detail freak to guess there might be a wrong way to plug in an electrical appliance. This is obviously a gimmick to avoid responsibility for their crappy product."
1,Worked for less than a year,Bought this a year ago and it worked well.Barely can get any cool air out of it this summer.Don't waste your money.
2,portable heater,"The heater even at 80f only heats a very small area in a room, and not at the temp it is set at,and this room is only 125 sq ft. with a door closed for that room. That is with the temp. being at 36F. what will happen when it is colder? The drain is so low it is very hard to drain which is at least once a day. I am disapponted that it does not live up to what you claim."
2,terrible factory help,"I have a lx-140 portable unit and after only a months use the squirrel cage fan on the condensing unit litterally exploded, I called the factory and they dont sell the part and need to contact a service center, I asked for a list of service centers or a place to buy the part and the guy told me I would have to Google it? What kind of a company wouldnt have a list of certified repair centers for their own product. I think this company is just terrible on helping their customers"
2,"Makes cold-ish air, LOUDLY!","Bought this around May of 2012 and have used it a couple of times to help the tired central AC in my 50 year old apartment building cool my top (10th) floor apartment. Let me put it this way: if you are sitting directly in the line of fire (or in this case, cool air), it's great. It does not, however, cool the bedroom or the living room down much at all, and it's super loud (even when the AC compressor off). I got a sound meter app on my iPhone and checked. Soleus says its average sound transmission is around 46 db from 3 feet away with the thing on medium fan speed. I got around 66 db under those conditions. Just sayin! It was an expensive experiment, and it really did not pay off. Oh well! :("
2,Works but it's a hassle.,"This is probably the biggest, heaviest, and most cumbersome air conditioner I've ever owned. My sister gave it to me and said she just didn't like it. After a few months of owning it, I completely understand.First the good:- It can get a room from 90 down to 70 very quickly.The bad:- It will not automatically shut down when it reaches 70. The temperature setting just seems to be what it's pumping out.- It will drip out water everywhere. I ended up with a massive mold outbreak in the corner where the unit was. The part that says ""Evaporative"" is 100% bunk.- You will break your back trying to lift it.- It doesn't remember auto-on and auto-off settings and about once a week it seems to forget all of its settings entirely.In short: For the money that you pay for this, you could get an air conditioner with a lot more features that isn't going to dominate and destroy a corner of your room."
2,"Air conditioning works well, but the weight and the wheels...","I was expecting adequate air conditioning from this unit - it works better than I was anticipating.I was expecting a large unit that weighed a considerable amount - that you can get from the product description, and it was what I was expecting.What I did not expect was the undersized wheels on the unit. Coupled with the weight, when I first rolled it across my hardwood floors the unit left tracks forever sunk into the floors.So overall the unit worked as-expected, but damaged my wood floors just be wheeling it - a very expensive lesson."
1,Absolute Garbage.,"This product is a total waste of money. The only reason I got it is because my HOA doesnt allow window units.It claims 14000 BTU but can barely cool at 120 sq ft room. On hot days it can only get my room down to 78 degrees. It's pitiful. Since that room never gets down to the thermostat temp, the compressor stays on constantly.In addition to not working as an Air Conditioner, it also needs to be drained constantly. It's supposed to exhaust the condensation, but it does an extremely poor job at that. It will shut off after running for 6 hours or so.GET A WINDOW UNIT IF YOU CAN"
4,Soleus portable,Pretty much does what it is advertised to do. I solved the drain pan problem by tubing it out the wall in a permanent fashion with a combination of tygon tubing and aluminum tubing so that it will self drain.
1,Garbage,"I wish I could give it 0 stars. Bought in July of 2010. Cooled relatively well till end of August and started leaking a lot of water while the drain reservoir was empty. Had to mail it back to company which was really difficult given weight. They sent us a new one which we started using June 2011. Started leaking a tremendous amount of water after three weeks. Again, no water in the drain reservoir. We contacted the company again and they said sorry, the warranty only replaces the unit once. $500 down the drain. You'd think in this day and age a company could not get away with selling garbage that doesn't work for $500. I will be suing them in small claims court and filing a complaint with consumer affairs, but I don't know if it will do any good. Avoid Soleus!"
5,"Cherubini, a forgotten musical giant","Cherubini was a famous and talented opera composer in France before the revolution but later he dedicated only to sacred music, giving to the posterity several masterpieces: 3 or 4 requiems, many masses and motets. Also his instumental output is great, like his string quartets.This requiem was truly loved by Beethoven, a great admirer of Cherubini, who expressed his desire in his own funeral service to ""hear"" a performance of this masterpiece.There are some recordings of this requiem but this one by Christoph Spering and his Das Neue Orchester in period instruments is the best by far. Pristine sound and articulation, strenght and a great sense of the work's architecture. More than sublime, this mass for the dead is at the same height of other famous requiems in history. Listen and judge."
4,Outstanding Try,"Being an avid fan of Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks, and also of Christine McVie and Lyndsay Buckingham's solo work, I have to admit that this album may not live up to certain standards, BUT it is a beautiful tribute to the enchanting and seductive works of art that were born from Fleetwood Mac. There may be no lyrics, but the harmony between instruments and the elegant ""feel"" leaves this album feeling just like a ""dream""."
4,Classical Fleetwood Mac,"This CD is a beautiful tribute to a great band. Nic Johnston's classical acoustic guitar provides a completely different feel to these classic Fleetwood Mac songs. If you love Fleetwood Mac and enjoy acoustic instrumental music, you can't go wrong with this CD. I especially like the haunting version of ""Rhiannon"". A very enjoyable CD!"
3,Corrs ain't so bad on dreams!,"I admit that dreams by fleetwood mac is a hard act to follow. However, this is a tribute album, and if you think that the Corrs did not do a good job on ""dreams"", then check out the video of the Corrs live in the Albert Hall in London. In the video, Mick Fleetwood drummed for a rendition of ""dreams"" by the Corrs. Look and see how much he enjoyed it."
2,Cheapo,"Maybe works good with an over-ripe, borderline rotten, melon, but for anything firmer than a Wendy's frosty* they'll just bend on you."
4,Decent Compilation with Obscure Bands,"Purchasing compilations can be hit and miss. Sometimes there'll only be one redeemable song surrounded by alot of crap. But this one gives a good 5 or so. It's a good way to discover some of these bands; however, most of their releases are long out of print and/or hard to find."
3,Have you got this one?,"You'd probably buy it for the Beck song... well thats worth the admission. I was kinda hoping Id stumble upon another Beck on the record label, but as it turns out there is only one Beck at fingerpaint records, but the others are allright.Basically its a 2 star compilation where the addition of Beck gets it another star.'ts'allright"
3,Button lovers bewhere,"This game i all about the stylus, you tab Kirby to make him move and make little bridges. So no buttons. In some locations i had a heard time getting to the enemies because of the cliffs. I am not very far in the game:(. This is my only Kirby game. (Unless you count Super Smash Brothers Brawl.) But i have played Kirby Super Star Ultra (my friends game) and it was more fun. I liked it because of Kirby's transformations and the challenge for us button lovers.(Oh yeah did i mention he is limbless.)Pros-Challenging.The always loved transformations.Cons- absolutely no buttons. (It uses the DS to it's full potential but not the gameboy.)Some levels are just way to difficult, so you give up after a while.RKgamer"
1,this game is terrible,"this game has only 7 worlds with each world taking about 5 minutes, and the controls are stupid because you can only use a stylus pen."
4,"addictive, fun, but a little too short","this game has good graphics, it has fun gameplay, great bosses, and uses the touch screen a lot. In kirby canvas curse, kirby is sent to a different dimension... i think. You being the player finds a magical paintbrush and you aid kirby to go back to dreamland. This game has two modes in which to play on: main game which you go through the story as kirby or 3 other characters, or rainbow run. There are 8 worlds to go through, each world having 3 levels. At some points the game may get frustrating but overall it is a great game."
4,Great DS Kirby Game,"This is by all means a very good game, my one problem with it is that there just isn't enough replay value. Ever since I played my first Kirby game I have been a huge fan of the Kirby game franchise. The difficulty of the 7 worlds with 3 levels each are honed to perfection and very fun to maneuver. The final boss is creative but predictable. The copy abilities are great, but their just isn't enough replay value. I got this game with a DS for Christmas and loved it, but I had beaten it a few days after New Year's, but it got gradually more boring after that. I recommend this game to everyone, but I'm warning you, it won't last long."

I recommend this game to everyone, but I'm warning you, it won't last long."
4,Review of the pink ball,Kirby has been in a long generation of Games Few good Most badI am a huge kirby fan i have all his games but i cant say i liked them all. But this one is an acception. The DS did a great job of using the pointer thing. You would use it as a Rainbow line to guide kirby around and up and down kirbys enemies. The Game was very well done. But i excpected Better Graphics from the new Nintendo DS system it was very well done. I give it 4 Stars overall
3,An okay game.,This game is okay but not one of my favorites. When I first got my DS this game came with it I played it and started to enjoy it. But after a while I got bored of it. It seems all the levels are the same with the only difference being the backrounds.It was also rather easy all you really need to do is wipe the DS pen across the screen a couple of time and before you know it the game's over. This game would be a lot better if they'd make it more longer and challanging.Over all this isn't the best Kirby game I own.Grade: B
4,Great Job on Worship Standards & New Material,"My sister loaned the CD to me; now I need to have a copy of my own! My very favorites on this CD are new to the band: ""Before the Day"", which talks about communion with God in the early hours, and ""Favorite Name is Father"", talking about how we can address God with a myriad of names, but He has a preference. Both are ballads with a solo cello to accompany them; they are both superbly performed. The bonus of this CD: the live version of ""Arise My Love""."
5,Dynamic and Powerful,"Dynamic, powerful and real! These gentlemen were actually praising and woshipping the God that they know with fervor, passion and excellence. They were not just cookie cutting another album. A must have!"
3,Okay,"Liked the book, however was having a hard time doing some of the postures in the early pregnancy time. Dint like the fact that had to keep reading and looking at the book while doing the posture. Some postures were great if you know them already. Trying to learn from reading the book doesnt work. Overall book was good though."
1,Frank let me down!,This projet was done for money. Frankie in his elderly state was in no condition to sing. I hated it! The first time I have been disappointed by Sinatra. I love his music but everyone is allowed a mistake or two now and then. Rest in peace maestro.
2,cd is screwed up,"I bought this cd as a present for my wife and it double plays, we put in the cd i purchased at the same time of Tony Bennet and the player worked fine so I am trying to return this thing. very poor quality cd"
2,Hard to read,I thought the white display on a black background looked cool in the photo but it turns out to be very dim and extremely hard to read. You need to be in a fully lit room and hold it at just the right angle for it to be legible. This is in sharp contrast to my old Timex Ironman watch (with the standard black display on a light background) which was easily readible under a variety of light conditions.
1,disappointed in this watch,"I have had two timex ironman watches - I gave one away and lost the other. I replaced it with this one - price was good and it looked nice. Howver, when i'm running, unless the sun is directly on the face, i cannot see it. And - when running and using the intervals, I cannot hear the tones idicating the end of the interval. So - totally useless for these purposes."
3,Screen Hard to Read,"This is the second Ironman triathlon sleek watch I've owned. I decided to purchase this one based on my overall satisfaction with my first watch (the band finally broke after several years). Since the blue watch proved to get pretty dirty I decided that the green body and black face appeared pretty cool on-line. In reality it's hard to see the white numbers on the black background unless you tilt your wrist in an ideal way. Basically there is no way to ""sneak"" a peak at the time. In addition, both watches have let water into the screen occasionally (1-2 times during the life of the watch) which creates a ""cloud"" that usually subsides after a day or two."
2,Dirty Band,"I have had the watch now for several weeks. I really wanted the black face because i thought it was cool. I read the reviews--and was nervous because some people had trouble seeing the face. I haven't had much trouble, but I hate the light colored band. From the picture, i couldn't tell if the black trim on the band turned completely black, as it got toward the back of the band, because that is the area that gets the dirtiest. But no, the band is green throughout and is grimy after three weeks. For a sporst watch, it certainly absorbs dirt."
1,this watch no good,"Although the watch probably tells time, I can't see it because the numbers do not show up brightly in the black face. It looks great on line, but it really is useless to me. I can see the numbers if I turn on the light, but who wants to push a switch every time they want to see what time it is??? I am now paying for shipping both ways just to find out that the product can't be used. I will never order another product from Amazon that I have not seen in a store already. It is stupid to pay for shipping just to look at something that isn't any good and that cannot be used."
5,Love it!,I love this watch! The color is awesome and the features are great! The service I recieved was fast and efficient! Thank you!
4,Useful watch,"I bought this watch several months ago and I still love all the features, especially the multiple alarms that you can set for weekdays vs. weekends or everyday. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the light color shows dirt after a while and the rubbery plastic does not clean easily."
2,not so much,i like the look of this watch on the computer..the blackface looks neat...but in real like the numbers are really hard to see unless you are in direct light.
1,Can't See Screen,Can't read watch without using light. This is no good since who wants to do this all the time. Don't get watch with black background.
4,Great watch but dim numbers,"This is a great watch, but some of the prior reviews are correct. The numbers are very dim on the watch face. Fortunately, my daughter's love for lime green has overcome this disadvantage. My suggestion to new buyers is to buy another color with black numbers on a regular digital face."
1,Screen too dark,"The screen of this watch which appears bright white in the advertisement is actually a faded grey-brown. The sceen is readable in broad day light, but I don't want to have to make an effort to move my watch into the light every time I want to know what time it is. I am sending mine back."
2,Decent attempt,"The book is outdated, unclear in its focus, and makes assumptions for the reader. This book provides only a poor intro to Squeak and poorly touches up on OO principles. Liu's Smalltalk book is probably where one would want to start to get both worlds. Worst, this book is used at Ga Tech for a class titled ""Objects and Design.""Also, all the previous book reviews on this page were reviews of Squeak and Alan Kay as opposed the book. So their 5 stars are misplaced."
3,"good content, but flaws in figure reproduction troublesome","The content is quite useful, and I'd have given it four stars out of five, but the screen captures appear to have been saved and reproduced as JPEG images. This results in the text being almost completely unreadable in some figures, such as 4-16 and 4-17. Even the better-looking figures still show a high level of JPEG artifacts. It's astonishing that this wasn't noticed in galley proofs and corrected.I've been seeing these problems more frequently in recent books, and even in the local newspaper. Publishers really need to learn that JPEG is only for continous-tone photographs, NOT for line art or text."
2,WHAT ! NO BYBLOS ???,"What is it with record companies. What planet are they on? I can't believe that such a worthy tribute album could have been so badly put together. Terry Kath was a truly great guitarist and songwriter. Why then do we have a collection of tracks of which a mere handful are Kath compositions and hardly any really define his intensity, lyrical perspective or guitar playing. Where are ""Oh, Thank You Great Spirit"" ""Song Of The Evergreens"" or ""Takin'It On Uptown"" to name but a few. And ""Byblos"" ??? where is ""Byblos"" !!! Surely one of the best songs ever written. This is a great album if you want a Chicago collection, but if it's the real Terry Kath you want, best to get a CD-R and make your own !"
5,Terry Kath was the heart and soul of Chicago,"As a 30 year fan of the greatest American Rock band Chicago, I can say with some authority, they never fully recovered from the loss of Terry in 1978. He was the guts of this band, the heart and most definitely the soul. This album is a must for early Chicago fans and I highly recommend it."
2,not too much inside,"The book is well written but it is not for learning nuclear physics. There is nothing inside except a nice list of topics with a very superficial view of them. So it is like a good syllabus but does not contain any real pieces of useful stuff for newcomers to the topic.I found quite good for general approaches when no details at all are needed (like tales or just a narrative about nuclear matter). Also, if you want to do the end chapter problems you have to go for the more conventional books, so again, it is just a nice syllabus. Not to mention that there is no insight at all on how experimental work is related with nuclear physics, even the scattering cross section is highly theoretical and far from reality.So, it is not bad but not useful for practical purposes, it is a good guide but not recomended as a study book on the subject, like Krane's, just to mention one."
2,"Simplified, dumbed-down, disappointing","Nikola Tesla was a genuine genius. As such, he deserves better than this book. Certainly, it covers Tesla's life and achievements, but does so in a very simplified and dumbed-down way. If you know nothing of electricity beyond flicking a light switch, it's probably quite illuminating. Otherwise, you're better off with other books about Tesla."
5,It rocked,I loved this book it told in detail everything to the lives of the samshing pumpkins provign they are a very well organized band and work very hard
5,The book is a must if you really like the pumpkins,This book and cd was the best that i have ever read and listened too. If you love the pumpkins you would get it too.
5,GREAT DVD,"This is a good work that presents the work of Francisco Gabilondo Soler, and the cartoons are very good. I love and my kids too. This album is in spanish"
1,Not the real cri-cri,This is not the real voice of cri cri-it is a lady instead. If you are looking for the real voice of cri cri do not buy the dvd. It misleading.
5,It would be funny if it wasn't so true,Rall's comic political/social satire strikes home. It would be funny if it didn't ring of the reality of what the world is and will become if we don't wake up.
3,A mixed bag,"True, 2024 has some biting commentary and it's most definitely food for thought. But even as someone who agrees with Rall's views, particularly in his regular work, including comics and articles, I still think this is an overblown comic book all prettied up for a hardcover book. There's just not enough meat here to justify the format.The characters are rather plain and have very little distinguishing characteristics. I think that's part of Rall's point -- people losing their individuality. However, even 1984, which I'm honestly not a fan of in terms of general fiction readability, had better characters than this.2024 is good, but it's really just an overpriced comic book with a good message."
2,Great ideas but could have been presented better,"2024 is about mindless consumerism. People are driven only by caring about themselves and collecting ""points"" to buy useless stuff (really, isn't that where we are almost at now?). It was okay, it only takes about 45 minutes to read. I wish the art was better. I don't enjoy the ugly comics of today."
1,poor item,this item i was thinking would be like the charm from rocky you know the boxing glove pendant. but unfortunalty you get what you pay for half a small boxing glove the back is hollowed out and the front doesnt look as good as it doesn in the pictures my advice save your money and buy a more expensive one
3,A snooze fest,"Boy, it this episode bore me. I mean, don't get me wrong, Clayton Raynor's performance as the deaging Admiral was excellent and the idea of someone deaging from a frail old man to a strong young man is a good one. But the dialogue didn't really give me any suspense for what would happen to this man. Also, as much as the makeup for the run of TNG has been solid. They must of had an offweek with the old man makeup, made it look like he was melting. But maybe that was what it was supposed to be, i don't know. I just didn't like it"
2,Disapointed,"These sheets were a disapointment--thin and not exactly soft. But the worst part was the size. I own a queen pillowtop matress so purchased a queen sized sheet set. It was about 8 inches too wide. I returned the queen size and bought a full size, and it was too small. I am going to buy elsewhere to find one that is ""just right."""
3,Okay,"It is a nice CD, I like his recording of Amazing Grace the best, and America The Beautiful is good too."
4,The Fans Have Gotten It Right,"Bjork herself called this CD ""without heart"" on her website, but strangely the exceptionally premature ""Greatest Hits"" works amazingly well. By not taking the traditional route avoiding chronology to provide instead a solid mix of music was brilliant. Even those hardcore Bjork fans might want to at least look at the arrangement of the songs since the most unlikely of songs become good bedfellows when paired back to back. The only carnal sin here is the exclusion of any tracks from the experimental SelmaSongs. One would think ""I have seen it all"" would be here amongst the list, Alas, no. ""It's In Our Hands"" wraps the compilation up with an original composition. If this album had waited another few studio albums to come out, the result may have been more effective, but for what we're given it is shockingly enjoyable."
5,AWESOME!,"Bjork is my favorite artist of all time! Her music is awe inspiring with it's technical and vocalistic wonders. She truly is a one of a kind and no one will ever beat or match her! This compilation is very welcomed and features a good portion of what she offers with her talents. I have listened to this cd over and over and will never tire of listening to it! That is one of her amazing facets, you never get tired of listening to her songs because they are so unique and beautiful! Bravo darling!! Gotta love ya! And the unreleased song ""It's in Our Hands"" blew me away! Also check out the newly released Volumen Plus DVD collection of videos. Her videos are just as incredible as her music. Check it out!!"
2,Eliminate the vocals & it's really not all that bad.,"The instrumental music that accompanies Bjork's vocals are creative and atmospheric, however I just cannot stand the sound of her voice. I'm sorry, but it is annoying to me. I'd like to find a copy of this greatest hits cd without the vocals, I'm sure you could do it on your PC with the proper software."
2,Bjork = Bad,"I bought this cd, even though the cover kind of scared me, hoping to hear songs like Its oh so quite. But NOOOO!Its oh so quite was not even on this cd wich makes no senseto me at all. This cd has little of any value. Avoid it by all means. If Bjork continues to get more and more weird she will problubly end up selling no records at all."
1,Dont Buy This .,If you want good music then stay away from this tripe. She is also not a very nice person.More ego than real talent.
4,Nice mix for newcomers,"This is a great way to introduce oneself to Bjork's music. It does what a greatest hits album should do. Picks out the quality sounds and leaves much of the noise and clutter out. I own 4 other Bjork albums and to me, many of them contain tracks that lack substance. Tracks that are not much more than interesting sounds arranged, experimented with, but without a theme or cohesion. I'm not a huge fan of Bjork but a number of solid tracks on this album swept me off my feet."
4,"greatest hits is wonderful, but not essential","Um... Well, whoever that ""Bubba"" character thinks he is by giving this album 1 star had better be a little more open-minded about certain things. The only other music he seems to listen to is Christian stuff. That's all he's reviewed, anyway. A bit too ignorant of other (better) music, in my personal opinion (which i've censored quite a lot, in order to hide my anger and dislike toward bible-thumpers who can't stand ideas that don't involve jesus/god).But this album, while a great introduction, isn't a definitive Bjork album... Buy the other albums, especially Debut and Homogenic. The full albums generally provide a better experience in which her music can be more fully understood."
3,Not satisfied,Your CD case looked messy and completely different from what i expected. But so far i am enjoying the song on the CD.
3,The Obligatory Greatest Hits Cd...,"Its become expected that after 4 albums, an artist puts out a selective set of songs known as the Greatest Hits. Not being in chronological order, this set was selected by a poll taken of Bjork fans. The tracks are pretty good choices, but I was hoping that UNISON or I MISS YOU would make it to his album. I don't agree with Hunter being on this album though.If you have all of Bjork's previous albums, than it really is not necessary to get this cd. If your a new fan, this is a good enough introduction to her works.So, enjoy this one if your unfamiliar. The new song can easily be downloaded, or buy the entire album just for the new song. Its your choice."
3,"It's enough for me, no more Björk after this.","I have bought this CD. I must say it's OK, I like most of the songs. I can't say I like all of them, either. But definitively, not my cup of tea. I think this is the only Björk's release I will ever have. I don't like her style enough to buy all her albums."
3,"Saw the movie, read the book","The full movie is available on youtube. It's a very good film that follows the book accurately. The book has less knife fighting and rather a lot of sex. The book also alludes to Greek mythology more so that the movie. It's clear the author has an understanding of American knife culture, as many custom knives are referenced. The knife seller scene in the movie was rewritten. The book went into more detail about various features of each knife. The book has a all Brazilian view, whereas the movie brought in international actors. The screenplay was written by the book's author, so he blended this well. I would give the film a higher rating than the book, although the book was readable and never bogged down. I hope this was helpful to you."
1,"High Art, not like Exposure","I enjoyed the 1991 movie Exposure, ( http://www.amazon.com/Exposure-Peter-Coyote/dp/078310135X ) so I thought I would also enjoy High Art, the novel on which the film is based. Both book and film are set in Brazil and tell a story of revenge in the underworld of that country. However, where Exposure kept the plot moving quickly along (and had some good fight scenes for martial arts fans), the plot of the book plods slowly along, giving out pertinent details only reluctantly, in small doses, while its author tells a narcissistic and pornographic soap opera. Much better reading can be found on my Books for Guys list at: http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/R3A2ZOJIC3IOSA/ref=cm_pdp_lm_titleExposure"
1,Not a good product,"Just would not work for me. No matter how I set the hand strap on camera, the strap just did not fit right nor wrap on my hand/wrist properly so I could shoot or hold camera comfortably. Additionally, the part that screwed into the camera was off-line setting when I put camera on tripod. It just felt uncomfortable to me when shooting on tripod. It was as if I was shooting from side of tripod and left me feeling that I was shooting off-center. This product to me is a waste of money. I do not recommend its' purchase. Chalk this up as a lesson learned. I just went back to the shoulder strap that came with the camera. I just have the camera held with the strap around my neck or shoulder or on a tripod when I go out to shoot. I have decided to wrap the shoulder strap a few times around my wrist when carrying the camera which seems to work better than this product."
1,"flimsy, poor design, poor concept","I went to a local camera shop (SAMY'S) to try out some of the hand grips they had. Unfortunately, their selection wasn't grand, and they recommended this one as ""the best.""I tried it in the store, using my Canon 40D. It was next to impossible to set up, and once we did manage to get it on my camera, it felt flimsy, and I felt no security in how it would steady my camera. Thankfully I was able to try it before I bought it. I did not buy it."
5,Simple introduction to tensor calculus,This simple and informative little book gives a detailed introduction to tensor and matrix calculus. A good introduction for anyone who's ever wondered about tensors.
2,This watch is way smaller than it looks,"For a men's watch, I was rather disappointed. The watch is about the width of an average woman's watch. The wrist strap is small; the band is thinner than the width of my smallest finger. I'm 5ft 11inches tall and I have an average man's wrist. This watch is so small, I'm on the last notch.The wriststrap is the smallest of any of the Nike watches I ever owned. I would strongly advise you to get the midsize 100 version if you are looking for a normal man's watch. I was sorely disappointed.The lighting is subpar and not terribly bright. For some reason, nike decided to reverse the lighting, causing the watch face to go dimmer.I had high expectations since this is my second nike watch. I also felt disappointed that Nike abandoned the coin-open battery cover design on their earlier models to go for a decidedly clumsier micro screw panel.It's a huge step backward."
1,Haha,"This movie was so horribly filmed and made. The videography was totally grainy. I recommend that you should only watch this movie for the sake of laughing at it's flaws. It seems as if the actors are blind, and cannot see anything eye level. Also, it is violent too! Alas, it is embarrassing to have fallen for the cute preview and actually spend money on it because that was $4 that we regret spending."
5,Not Big Budget - But Super Cute!,"This movie is very cute. I wish they had a bigger budget to make it not so cheesy. I love the kid who played Reese! Absolutely ADORABLE! I wish I could've seen him in more things. He played the perfect ""Cool Kid""! Overall pretty cheesy movie but I thought it was cute!"
1,Probably a fifth grade school project,"This movie was insulting to viewers of all ages. It essentially mocked the intelligence of anyone watching it. The ""writers"" and producers did not even bother trying to cover up the strikingly glaring holes in logic and sequencing. Our 7 and 9 year old children both concluded quickly that this was ""the dumbest movie"" they had ever seen. Not only that, it looked as if it was filmed in a city park and the ""action"" was as exciting as watching butter melt on a kitchen counter. Movies for kids often have a formula to follow but this one just settled for making the outline of the formula and assuming the audience was ignorant enough to go along with them. Well, it doesn't work that way. I feel sorry for the adult actors in the movie since their careers would have to be impaired by the greedy ""felony""now on their resumes. I strongly advise staying away from this ""film"". Any family could do better by making their own home movie."
5,Great Design,"We have had this clock radio for several years and I cannot say enough about how great it is. It is extremely user-friendly. There is no fumbling with the buttons when you are trying to set the alarm, even in the dark. It has a toggle button to change between standard time and daylight savings. Such a simple idea! Why don't all clocks have that? It keeps time during power outages without any batteries. They seemed to think of everything for this clock. My only complaint is the background light in the display is much brighter than it needs to be. I taped red cellophane over the screen to take care of that problem."
4,refreshing,"This cd is very good. The strings are well done throughout, as well as Terry Kath's unique bass playing, and Robert's wonderful keys and vocals. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
2,Be aware!! There is NO re-condition done for the machine I received!,"I tried the item the moment it arrived. The machines not only looked dirty, but the water tank was linking!! Hello?! Obviously, there is no RE-CONDITION done for the machine I received! I wondered if other machines have been RE-CONDITIONED??!! Buy at your own risk and luck!!"
1,Sloppy piece of hack work,"For those used to Robertson's ponderous and derivitive offerings, this will come as no surprise. His ""find"" that Hill suffered from V.D. has been readily apparent to anyone who ever read the general's correspondence (and who can recognize a 19th century euphamism). As for the rest, Roberston's factual blunders (like his ridiculous mention of the non-existent shoe factory in Gettysburg) are surpassed only by his uncritical fawning over his subject.A. P. Hill was a fine soldier. He deserves a better biographer."
3,"Robertson has written an in-depth, thoughtful book","however I can see how some civil war buffs would feel that this book looks at A.P. Hill through rose colored glasses. A.P. Hill was exactly the kind of general that Longstreet hated, proud, political, overly aggressive...He was passionate about his men and his cause but much like Hood lacked tactical and strategic skills. The corp he commanded at Gettysburg should have gone to D.H. Hill. In 1864 and 1865 he provided steady, reliable service but never distinquished himself."
4,At last a good book with maps on the vikings!,"The maps in this book are clear and readable. It can be used as a stand alone, informative text, or as a supplement for historical reference. The timeline at the beginning of the book offers a comparison of activities in different parts of the world from AD 1 to 1024. This is very helpful and puts a number of events into perspective! Not only does this book help if reading Scottish, Irish and English history, but it ties in nicely while reading the new translation of Beowulf by Seamus Heaney! (Although, I would have liked a bit more information on this period) However, as a book with an overview with great maps, this book is a elemental reference text for any history buff!"
3,"Anglo-centric and a little outdated, but okay","Although I agree with the other reviewers that the maps and the two-page spreads are handy and informative, in my opinion the book lacks information on some of the most important recent findings on viking life and culture in their homelands. It also bothered me that the author chose to use the derogatory term ""Lapp"" rather than ""Saami"" to refer to the other group living in Scandinavia at the time. I felt that for an American audience, the book assumes too much prior knowledge of British geography and history. The text makes many references that are not illustrated in the maps. The book is great for someone focusing on viking battles, influences and history in Great Britain (and to a lesser extent on the Continent), but I feel it lacks important information about viking life in Scandinavia. There were also some bloopers, like calling ""Aud The Deep-Minded"" (from Laxdoela Saga) ""And The Deep-Minded"" on p. 44."
4,viking historical atlas,It wasn't the fastest shipping I could have hoped for but it did get here within the allotted time.
3,"Looks pretty, but could use a fact-checker","Although, as a visual learner, I enjoyed the wide array of maps and pictorial descriptions of Viking life and travels in this book, errors were present on almost every page regarding when events occurred, who participated, and where they took place. I note Dr Haywood has left the staff of Lancaster University, and I do not question his academic credentials, but to use this book as a complete reference source for the Vikings would be limiting - students would be better served by a stronger, better researched text, to accompany Dr Haywood's book."
2,Didn't like it very much,"I was looking for something that talked about using dance to become more spirtually, emotionally, and physically active...instead the book is basically just about dancing to ""her"" music, with ""her"" rhythms, that she has attached some special meaning to. I like some of her music but was disappointed in this book."
2,"Pompous, Anything Goes Homily","I like Gabriel Roth's music, but in her book she's full of herself, constantly congratulating herself for being hanging out in ""hip"" and ""funky"" clubs in East Village. Seeming to recognize the empty pompousness of her story, she awkwardly and unconvenciencly envokes ""God"" has ghostwriting events. Writing about dance is difficult. I recommend Constance Schrader's ""A Sense of Dance"" for a grounded discussion, free of image."
5,Amazing,"This book helped to me recognize that life is a dance to me. It has given me tools to ground this flighty Gemini in a dance. The 5 rhythms are amazing to use dancing to electronic music (especially goa trance!) and recommended for all of us ""new school"" dancers that listen to electronic music as our way of life."
1,Old Product-Do Not Buy,"This product is a VERY OLD product that YogaFit put out in 1994 and the audio publishing company is still selling it as a new product. YogaFit's technique and entire program has changed dramatically since 1994 and the company offers MUCH better DVDs, CDs and other merchandise. Please visit [...] and to view YogaFit's products. Please do not waste your time on this old product!"
5,This was the product I was looking for,"I was looking for a mini tape recorder in order to use it at the University. My main search was for a product with a small and powerful microphone, and now I think that I choose the best choice. The sound I recorded was clear and almost without unexpected noises. Additionaly, the radio broadcast are easily heart. I recommend this walkman. I think you will never change your mind once you test it. Thank you SONY. You did it again."
2,Carharrt men's jeans,I'm disappointed. I wanted fleece lined jeans. I thought that was what I ordered. I don't know if I'll ever order this type of product again.
2,another average song,I use to Kinda dig Mary J.Bliege but after a while Her tracks went down&Her Vocals became Yikes.this Song is so Predictable.Dr.Dre has that tired Beat in the Background.I'm glad Michael Jackson&Him didn't end up working together because Dre ain't Bringing nothing new to the Mix here.it's Danceable but a far Cry from Her First Album which had far tighter Grooves.
4,Does its thing,"This is a nice but very basic amp.The FX available are Delay, Chorus, Reverb, & Flange but they can't be run concurrently.(I mainly play blues-based stuff so it's cool since it tends to stay on a slight delay.)The overdrive (distortion) is there but very basic as well. If you're really looking to get a specific sort of sound you'll want to get a effects processor if you get this amp. It's important to keep this in mind - if you're learning and just generally ""testing the waters"" a better solution in this class might be a Line 6 Spider amp.Despite it's class (30w), this amp gets very loud, very quickly. (There's other reviews elsewhere that mention this and they are not overstated.) Depending on your situation, that could be a gift or problem.I'm happy with it. It's a Marshall that sounds like a Marshall."
4,Start with the Basics,"I used a forerunner of this book when I was in graduate school twenty years ago. I pull out the current edition when I need to review basic skills for myself or for supervisees. Middleman and Wood do a thorough job of defining sixty-three basic skills for direct paractice in social work. These skills are the foundation of any professional counseling work, and their absence from the curriculum of many schools is too well reflected in the professions.While social workers and counselors often pick up these skills along the way, the concise, straightforward listing and explication by Middleman and Wood is a better way to go.I think any counselor or social worker would benefit from a review of these basics, and any trainee or intern who has not encountered this book would benefit from it."
2,Severe technical difficulties,"Dr. Chen's Tai Chi for Beginners suffers greatly from primitive production techniques. I have three DVD players; this disc would only play on one. The music is dull and repetitious, and the scene is totally static, so if your monitor isn't LCD it will go to black fairly often. The teacher is good, I think, but the editing and general production are pathetic -- I speak as someone who has produced low budget videos. I suspect the one five star rating evaluation you have is an inside job, quite frankly."
1,Is this a kid's large?,"I like the style of the sweatshirt but one question comes to mind: Is this a kid's large? All of my hooded sweatshirts (and believe me, I have A LOT!) are larges and all are quite, well, large on me. This one however is extremely small and in a side by side comparison with my others you would think it actually was a small. I don't recall seeing anything that says it was a kid's sweatshirt when I ordered it online. Unfortunately I was absolutely desperate for a Bengals shirt of some kind since I was going to the Bengals game otherwise I would have attempted to return the item. I really don't think it was worth the price I paid either."
4,I found this book agreeable,"As far as erotica goes, this book was very good. I have read a lot of such material and this book had an extra spice that helped make the reading of it worth while. I would recommend it to any of my friends"
2,FUN READ,HARD TO BET PENTHOUSE THIS IS A WILD ON THAT KEEPS YOU UP FOR A A TIME. STORIES ARE COMPLETEUNLIKE SO MANY EROTICA. THIS IS A BOOK THAT YOU COULD BELIEVE THE SOTIES WHERE REAL.
4,very nice,"beautiful construction and design. made with the convinience of a head band, so you dont lose your mask in your celbrations. Just flip it up and it stays put. Pity that the surface is fragile and prone easily to scratches."
4,Good buy,The door handles showed up and they have 2 parallel grooves going through them. Not what I expected because the picture shows a smooth finish...however they still look really good.
2,not as advertised,The product showed up on time and was a good price but was not the same as the picture posted on the site. It has two lines running the length of the handle where the picture shows a smooth finish. Disappointing as it was the smooth finish I was looking for.
3,"Look great, almost OEM - but won't last as long","*** Update ***Well, after a few years they are still OK but just starting to deteriorate. Still good for the price! Just expect to replace them every three to five years if you park outside somewhere like Florida.*** End Update***Look great! Would have been 5 stars if they fit just a LITTLE more flush with the door panel but you won't be disappointed."
4,Look almost OEM,Look great! Would have been 5 stars if they fit just a LITTLE more flush with the door panel but you won't be disappointed.
1,Boring,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz makes me want to sleep. So boring. Hard to believe you could mess up these great songs. This CD does.
3,STR,This actually is not made for windows 7 so there is no sound no matter what I do to try playing it.
3,Do not buy this game.,"This game is simple and after the novelty of getting the game the fun wears off. Basically, you have a few minutes to shoot a bunch of roaches running around. Five different maps and dull weapons contribute to the Two Thumbs Down i give this product."
4,Fun and Easy Shooting Game,"It doesn't take a lot of brainwork to play this game. If you like shooting gallery games, but with a twist, this is a game for you. My wife and I are addicted! It provides the kind of mindless fun you need after a hard day at work. Shoot the variety of roaches, targets, and special items to get more powerful weapons, extended time, etc. The game is timed, so you need to shoot fast and often to better your score (or your wife's score!)If you like simple, easy play, addictive games, Shoot The Roach is a good one."
5,Bester's Best,"Most of the short stories in thi s volume are also reprinted in ""Virtual Unrealities"" but, if you can find this volume, it is much better because of the introductions and essays that Bester wrote. They help to create the feeling that you actually know the man. The stories themselves are among ht ebest science fiction short stories that I have ever read."
2,not worth the price,"these coasters are not worth the current price there not a solid wood its more like a balsa wood, iv had them for 3 days and one already snapped when it fell off coffee table there stained walnut but certainly not a solid walnut as i thought they were,i would not pay more then $6.00 for these id love to find solid ones like i use to have ."
2,Poor quality,"This is a very functional fondue set (3 in 1, as advertised) - it is hard to find alternatives, even in a large price range. If you don't care about looks, but need functional, this is it, if you can swallow the price.The bad news:The quality of this set if sub-par.The copper plating is cheap - very cheap. In fact, 3 replacements later, I gave up (the thin copper plating was marred, burned, or completely scratched off out of the box)The steel is also thin - not necessarily a problem, but the unit could easily warp, and doesn't hold as much heat for as long as ceramic/iron sets.2 stars, given the price (thin steel sets can be found for far less, this copper plating - and even the simple ceramic insert - doesn't justify the price)"
5,"Rain, Sleet & Snow Won't Stand In The Way Of Great Grilling!","I am so inspired by ""Grill Power""; Holly takes the confusion out of indoor grilling and shares secret tips to help make it easier than I ever dreamed possible. And the advice she gave in the book helped me choose which model grill would suit our family. Best of all, the delicous recipes included are perfect for any occassion-- my family has loved ever one I've made so far. Healthy flavorful foods that are quick and convenient to make- what's not to love? I definitely recommend it."
5,Grill Power,"At last, a book for all us apartment dwellers who want to enjoy the pleasures of grilling but don't have the great outdoors at our disposal. Not only does this well thought out book cover great gastronomic territory but it brings important nutritional information to the ""plate"" as well."
3,Not what I was expecting,All in all some great recipes but not layed out the way I prefer for a cookbook. It is menu oriented so each grill item is set up with a couple of different recipes in more of a menu format. I prefer all similar items in a section. The recipes are good but not really what I was looking for in a grill press cookbook. Others who prefer a menu driven format will probably like this book.
2,Unappealing Book,"There may be good recipes in here, but I didn't see them. This is a cheap book; no photos of the food, one color printing, poor layout design."
1,1 star because 0 stars was unavailable!,Do listen to the sour grapes reviews. This book is for people looking for meals that you cannot pull together without first shopping at multiple locations to purchase the ingredients. I prefer simple recipes with items I can find in my pantry or pick up on my way home from work. Save your $$$!!!!
1,Save your money!,"This book was a huge disappointment, what fluff they filled the pages with. Most of the book is dedicated to reused recipes where she substitutes the grill for what would normally be a frying pan. Eighty percent of the book is recipes and eighty percent of the recipe info is about other things besides the grilling. That means 64 percent of the book is not about grilling!There is very little useful info for new grill purchasers. This book is a marketing ploy for new grill buyers. There are better cookboooks out there for recipes. With them I will figure out how to substitute the grill for the frying pan, without the author's help. Even her stated qualifications as an author for this book are sad. I went through this book over the first few days I had it. Right now I'm not sure where I left it, and I don't care a bit.In regards to the high regards; maybe it's their first cookbook?"
4,Yea NYE was pretty good,Yea I totally dug the NYE cd it was good stuff to bad that they had to break up. But I've heard some great things going on lately from Ilyn and I've talked to Dino and Jon lately they seem doing pretty well. Well if you want to check out what Ilyn is up to now you can go check him out at eitherwww.burningvegas.com or myspace.com/burningvegas they f'n own.They just released their E.P. in December on InHighDef records they also have Jon Sayre from Erase The Grey(Universal/Republic) singing for them. I found out about them when I heard Story of the Year talking about them at their concert.I haven't heard anything Dave is doing lately or if he is doing anything though but if I do I'll keep ya posted.
5,Further teachings of Lao Tzu in a more readable format.,"The Tao Te Ching is more poetic, but at times cryptic. Wen-Tzu goes into a bit more detail. The prose used, however, is in keeping with the ideal of Taoism that simplicity is better.Mr. Cleary also does an admirable job of setting it up in his introduction. Don't skip it!Although it can be thought of as the ""companion"" guide to the Tao Te Ching, it stands alone as a cornerstone of Taoist thought. A book of truth in its own right."
5,An eye-opener!,"I frankly had some difficulties with Lao Tzu. It may be due to the fact that the book's popularity invites too many ""free"" translations and ""interpretations"". This book is more unknown, but that means that the translation is a bit more scholarly. Wen-Tzu does explain essential aspects of taoism, and how to include them in your everyday life. He is clear where Lao Tzu is obscure, and practical where Lao Tzu is philosophical. Simplistic, but not simple - all of these teachings are easy to understand, but take years to really sink in."
5,Shamhala,"This book provides an imminently readable translation of the fascinating oral teachings of Lao Tzu. Think of it as presenting Lao Tzu, the metaphor or amalgam of Taoist thinking, as opposed to Lao Tzu the author. Approached this way, the book feels like an extrapolation of Te Tao Ching. The reader gets the chance to read and conclude on the reasonableness of the extrapolation. I liked it, and thought the logic and mysticism therein were very similar to that in the Te Tao Ching. As such, I would wholeheartedly recommend it to those fleshing out their concepts in Taoism"
4,A very good beginning,We have used this book as a Spanish tutorial. It covers the material that one needs to get a good foundation in the language. We found the exercises a bit repetitious in some cases. More variation may be better but they do drill on the material presented. This book has a far better sequence of presentation than many Spanish texts.
3,marginally helpful,"If you were expecting something akin to the breadth and depth of material found in the general FE review manual (which is excellent), or other discipline specific manuals by Lindeburg, the preparation manual for the industrial discipline specific test will leave you wanting.The manual is short, and essentially a practice exam. You will need other study materials, such as the Handbook of Industrial Engineering, to augment your study to adequately prepare for the exam.A suggestion for future editions would be a review of the subject material like you find in the general review manual."
5,What an excellent cd!,I first heard this amazing voice in the stanley tucci movie the imposters. the songs on this cd are either very sad or very happy depending on the mood you are in. They are incredibly romantic songs from the early half of the 20th century sung by one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard. It's very laid back and great background music to play softly when you are doing something stressful like writing a term paper or studying for finals.
3,Doesn't look as good as it works,"This is a very attractive soap dispenser which also works really well. The reason for the 3 star rating is that immediately after we started using it, any soap that dripped onto the dispenser discolored the bronze color. It now has many dark spots where the soap has hit. Also around where the soap comes out the bronze color has rubbed off. Works great, but I can not recommend it due to the appearance problem."
1,Won't Work On Anthing But Pc,"So far, for whatever reason, these won't playback on my home stereo system or my car cd player. They should be working, but they do nothing. They do work on my computer, but no place else, and both of these support this type of disk. I have used them in the past. I gave up and bought some non re-writable disks and they work fine everywhere."
5,Good product/value for the price,"Good product/value for the price - just as advertised, just as expected. Got this mostly for music and the disks have yet to give me any problem."
3,The Oompa Loompa Corral,"Standard shoot 'um up Western, WITH MIDGETS! These Tiny Cowpokes spend their time riding Shetland Ponies around in a miniture set. Creepy in that Classic kind of way. Kind of like a teeny Ed Wood."
5,exactly as Described,shipped quick and exactly as describedthanks recommend to othersi need ten more words now five now three and
5,Awesome,"My key remote works like new. I has a strong signal, as expected; it's Duracell. I'm well pleased. Not to mention the decent price I got it at!"
5,Hard to find battery!,"For a while I was looking for this replacement battery, finally decided to look online. As usual Amazon doesn't disappoint and it's been working great so far... a few months after."
5,Batteries,The product came in a timely manner.I was well pleased with the supplier.I will consider them for future purchases.
4,Great?,"I really loved this frog but my furries tagged teamed me snatched it up the first day and I never saw again so I think it really impressed them. So you need to be careful this toy is really small, not small enough for them to choke on but little enough not to easily find. Also, they really mean pull and go,it has a string cord to pull for it to vibrate and for it to vibrate you have to keep pulling it over and over again."
5,His favorite toy!!,"My ferret goes crazy over this toy! It has a little bell inside of it and even if Im not there to pull the string and play with him, it still keeps him entertained.If I cant find him, I grab this toy give it a few shakes and he comes running!Its hilarious to watch him play with this...gets the weasel war dance going every time!"
1,Dangerous and unscientific,"This book posits that mental health professionals can, merely by observing the verbal and non-verbal interactions between a child and a parent suspected of sexually abusing the child, arrive at an accurate conclusion regarding the presence or absence of abuse. Nothing could be further from the truth, and there is nothing in the scientific literature to suggest that such a thing is possible. The fact that a reputable organization such as the Kempe Institute would lend its name to this book and the protocol it suggests is disturbing to say the least. There is not a shred of statistical or empirical evidence to back up these claims and I shudder to think of the amount of harm to families this book caused. Pseudo science like this creates a situation in which the guilty go unpunished, and the innocent have their families destroyed."
3,Can a book both enlighten and yet be overly mystic?,"I just finished Education of Little Tree. There was no suggestion on my copy that it was a 'true' story. I knew that there was some background of the author as racist although not the particulars. I found the novel both touching and exasperating. I don't know if it reflects anything about the Cherokee Nation other than the Trail of Tears was terrible and a travesty of humanity. I have one Cherokee acquaintance who is rather mystical, so although that doesn't fit in my realm it doesn't seem so off the mark either. The touching relationship between Little Tree and his grandparents made it very appealing, as well as the appreciation of nature. I found it exasperating regarding attitude toward the government, politicans, etc. and yet it helped me see that many people who are 'off the grid' have a rationale for not seeing the value of taxes even though they did make use of their library frequently.Overall, I was glad I read it."
5,The Education of Little Tree,"The education of Little Tree was a very good book. The main charecters{Little Tree, Granpa,Granma}were very courageus and I liked their attitude and style and the way that they respected everything around them(the animals plants and the earth.) The bad guys were mean to little tree and called him names that he didn't understand. The story was an eccelent story and had you intrested the whole time. The Author really made you feel like you were walking along side Little Tree on the mountain trail."
4,A very touching story.,"A story of a small Native American boy being raised by his grandparents. Very charming and touching. This book is full of excellent lessons for all of us. In many ways, a deeply sad commentary on our majority culture."
5,Great bedtime story,"This is one of my favorite CDs to put in the player by my bed. Evocative, peaceful, poignant and soothing, it is guaranteed to send me to sleep quickly or keep me happily engaged if I can't sleep. Little Tree's storytelling is enchanting and Peter Coyote give it just the right touch.Which is right."
3,Carter a Documented KKK leader-Why it matters,"Author Asa Carter (Forrest Carter) was not just a KKK member, he was a leader who wrote Gov. Wallace's speech: ""segregation now, segregation forever"", supporting banning blacks from attending the University of Alabama (Look it up, it's at the library--Time, Newsweek, etc. Don't pretend to love books and not do your homework.) I don't advocate banning any books--just know that it is NOT an autobiography, as printed on most editions. By the way, Carter probably chose his pseudonym, Forrest, after Nathan Forrest, the founder of the KKK, which believes in the supremacy of whites above ALL other ""races"" (as if ""white"" was a race and not a color). So he was not a repentant man. He made his profession in speechwriting and radio. Go ahead and read this book, but if you'd actually like to learn about Native Americans, try a different one."
4,Should be required reading.,"This book is being sold as an autobiography of the Forrest Carter. It isn't!The Cherokee is one of the First American People that I have studied. The Cherokee names for things does not match what I have learned.However; this book IS a delightful peice of prose that will give you a look into the life of a poor mountain family in the Great Depression trying to make ends meet (including making illegal whiskey).This story begins with the death of ""Little Tree""'s mother when he was 5 years old, then going to live with his grandparents in the mountains.The story of the way ""Little Tree"" and ""granpa"" tricked two ""city slickers"" that was wanting to talk to ""granpa"" about making illegal whiskey for them is worth the price of the book alone! then there are other wonderful stories here too.I hope you enjoy the book; Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
4,A Book You'll Want To Share,"I think The Education of Little Tree is exceptional because, at its end, the reader feels a tremendous desire to pass the book on to a friend. Many novels leave you thinking, and you are content with your own journey to the author's world. The Education of Little Tree is different. After you read the final page you are determined that others will also visit Little Tree's mountain home. Why is this? Why do we readers all feel the need to share this novel? I think we want others to be as touched as we were, and continue to be, by this beautiful, beautiful story. What a world! Not only are the relationships loving and supportive, the kind we would all like to experience, they are of a time long gone. This is a wistful book; you yearn for Little Tree to be happy as you yearn for your own world to be as complete and connected to nature."
4,Moving,"Carter always claimed this book was autobiography, even though it now turn out it probably wasn't. (Well, we might have guessed that, especially during Disneyesque scenes like the two swindlers getting lost on the mountain.) But that doesn't matter - it's a fine novel, depicting the life of a young boy growing up with his grandparents and dogs in the mountains of Cherokee country in the Depression. The young boy's point of view makes for many comic and touching moments. We grow to care about these characters and their struggle to live free amidst discrimination a good deal, which makes the end all the more emotional. This is a fine book for both adults and junior high/high school readers."
1,A Pocahontas joke,"This book reads like the author saw the film Pocahontas and then decided to send it up by writing a faux-sentimental piece of drivel. If this was the intention, then ten out of ten - you succeeded in creating a really bad joke of a plot and extending it from a single page to an entire book-length work of fiction. It's written by someone who cannot write, and beyond being a really poor prank, is about as interesting as watching paint dry. Can I get my money back, please?"
1,Is it really an autobiography?,"Please, before you read or recommend this book, read thisarticle published on the NativeWeb...It calls into question theauthenticity of the author. The community has asked the publisher to re-classify the book as a novel, not as an autobiography."
1,Sucks.,"My language teacher made our class read this book last semester. It had to be the worst book I've ever read. It provided an unrealistic portrayal of the life of a Cherokee Indian, and I got the feeling that the author didn't do any research at all for this novel. Like most dumba**es, he makes the native americans seem 'magical' and 'mystical' like they practice wicca or something. the whole scene with the wilderness calling him home, and the trees singing to him was rubbish. it's corny and a waste of time."
5,My Review for The Education of Little Tree,"I Really enjoyed the book,I found it very hard to put it down. A wonderful book! But I also found it very sad,I would have prefered that it end on a happy note rather than a sad note.Forest Carter should of kept the grandparents alive What a way to grow up though. The novel really shows how childern lived from that time. I have the book 5 Times since reading it for the first time. A excellent book which I would recomned to people that I know. I also will be reading more of Forest Carters books."
3,Recommended as a curio,"This is the infamous book that fooled many people then and now. After the author's death, ""Forrest"" Carter, the so-called Native American, was revealed to be actually Asa or Ace Carter, George Wallace's speechwriter (most notably Wallace's ""Segregation Forever"" speech). That has been confirmed.If the reader bears that in mind, he or she may enjoy the book. I regard it more as a curiousity piece."
3,Little Tree,"Little Tree was an ok book.It was not very exciting. the ending was good though. Also, it was kinding confusing. It had an nice story to it though. I thought that it was slow and took forever for it to get on with the point. What happend is that Little Tree gets to go to an orphanage becaus his grandparents think that they are being selfesh. Little Tree dosen't like it at the orphanage and when his grandpa comes to visit him, Little Tree says that he want's to home. His grandpa says ok and takes him home. I liked that part of the story, it was nice."
5,"Truly heart-warming and human, despite author ""fake""","I loved this book, a truly hearwarming storyabout the pain and joy of being human. I had noknowledge of the author's politics and racismuntil I read the other Amazon reviews. If theauthor truly is a KKKer, you can't guess it fromthe text, as he treats people from diversebackgrounds with gentleness and respect.Yes, I am troubled by the author's supposed background.Yes, I abhor the KKK, racism in any form, and the veryidea that this author would claim that this work isautobiographical. But, this is a forumfor a BOOK review, not a soap box to critiquethe life of authors.Get off your soap box, Paula. P.S. I'll betthis isn't the first time a book was written/published for money!! What a silly,irrelevantpoint to make about this book."
5,The book and the man are not the same,"What a pity that critics of this book focus solely on the fact that this book was originally promoted as an autobiography, and that sad past of the author.Today both of those misconceptions have been well documented. The book is a novel. While I loath what Carter apparently stood for in his ""other life,"" there is no denying that this book is deeply moving. Separating the author's views from his work is what's need here. I do it with brilliant actress Vanessa Redgrave, and I can do it here.READ THIS BOOK!"
4,The Education of Little tree,"This was a very good, interesting story(true) with such good homespun advice about conservation, taking only what we can use, and how to treat other people through life. I liked it very much."
4,The Education of Little Tree,"This is a charming, heartwarming story that works for both adult and younger readers. It helps the reader gain an understanding of others and of the relationships, both with the natural environment and with the people we love. You will grow to love the characters of ""Little Tree"" and his grandparents. The story is so very touching that I cried tears as I completed my reading. I highly recommend this lovely book to people of all gender and ages."
4,"Read, didn't know, now I do, put it in it's correct place.","This is not the first time the wool has been pulled over the eyes of many. I read the book last year and was totally unaware of the author and his political views, because the Univ. of New Mexico would not lie about it being a true story. So, it drops down a notch. It is still a moving story. However, it leaves a knot in my stomach, thinking that it was true. Of course, I feel these events are too well described not to have happened in some way, shape or form to Mr. Carter. Look Homeward Angel was fiction, yet had been experienced. The same can be said for all of the books of Hemingway. Mr. Carter either saw these events or was a great listner of stories, and judging from his politics, I doubt he listened to non-whites much. But, for a good fictional short read, give it a try."
5,Great read,"I have read this book every year for the past 20 years, and I still enjoy it. It's just that kind of book. It tells the way life was in the backwoods during the early 20th century, and what it was like for a little Indian/white child who was taken in by his grandparents. Heartwarming and funny. one of a kind."
4,THE INDIAN OUTLOOK OF LIFE WHICH IS UNIQUE..SPELLED OUT,"I have always enjoyed and appreciated books about American Indians. Their society and outlook of life is very different from the typical Americans.' This book explains in simple detail what an Indian is about as it is written from the viewpoint of a 6 yr. old.Indians are purely physical as to their world makeup and they know what nature brings them and how it protects and feeds them. They also have a deep spiritual awareness that includes the ability of animals to aid in their daily life and help them in many different ways.This book does not go into some of the complex issues of Indian philosophy, but introduces one into the reality of life as ascertained by most Indians. A short read and one most worthwhile."
1,Buyer beware...,"People should read this book just so that they are aware of what a hoax looks like. Before the controversy erupted about this book, I'll bet many politically correct people read it and marveled at the truth of it all. This book points out that you can't believe everything you see in print. Things are not always what they seem to be. Aside from all that, I don't think the book is well written either. Read it just so that you can take a reasonable point of view when your friends discuss the controversy."
4,The End Was Incredibly Quick,"Throughout the meat of the book, it was an amazing (even if not certainly true) book. Filled with lessons from the Cherokee's ways, it enhanced the damage out government and army did to them. However, the last chapter seemed as if it was hurried, and but a bad impression on the rest of this great book."
1,"This book is a documented FAKE, written by a KKK member","Written strictly for the money, this man had no more to do withCherokees than Jesse Helms. The U of NM should know betterthan to insult Native Americans by continuing to promote thisas an Indian text. Shame on them."
5,so the good spreads out where no tellin' it will go,i've given about 30 copies of this little book to friends and acquaintances over the years. precious wisdom.
2,Disappointing,This book was assigned school reading. I found it rather boring and the language used in the story became annoying after a while. Not recommended.
1,ONE OF THOSE BOOKS I WILL ALWAYS RECOMMEND......NOT TO READ!,"The Education Of Little Tree is one of those books that I will always recommend...not to read!I hated, wait, hate is such a strong word, but it truly describes the way I felt about this book. I have read many critics' opinions on this book after reading it, I agree strongly with almost everything that a lot of the critics have said about this book. I thought it could have been written a little, I mean a lot better. Every time that I start reading a book for school, I think `Oh great, another pointless and boring book', and there are only some books that I have read that have contradicted that. The Education of Little Tree was not one of them. I may have used a lot of powerful words in this discussion, but that is the way I feel about books like this one. I really hope that we don't have to read books like this one during this school year."
4,"Laughter,Sadness and most of all, love","This book is about a young Indian boy who is brought up in the 1930's depression. He learns a lot from his grandparents on how to live in the mountains. It is a book that gets you feeling all kinds of emotions; laughter,sadness, and love. I liked this book because it goes to show that living with your grandparents or family can sometimes be more of an education then going to a school. I also liked the relationship with his grandfather and what they went through together. It is a book I would recommend for all ages and a good book to share with family. A great adventure."
4,Little Tree,Wonderful book written from the perspective of a little boy. Tells much about the American Indian's way of life and the ignorance of Americans regarding them.
1,Only for the saps,"Complete Dreck. If you want to read good American Indian fiction, this is not it. Try Sherman Alexi."
2,A manipulative novel,"If you're an adult reader, ""The Education of Little Tree"" may initially make you angry at the white man's world of cruelty and racism. The story, though, relies on standard elements of sentimentality: an orphaned little boy, half Native American, raised by his grandparents who are honorable without fault, surrounded by cynical whites who take pleasure in ridiculing and hating redskins. Little Tree himself is so innocent and good-hearted that he mistakes ridicule and laughter for affection, and of course he and his grandparents are at the mercy of white power and authority. Even young readers need to know that good and evil aren't so precisely delineated, that love of the land isn't only limited to the dispossessed, and that an awareness and a certain toughness of character are more likely to ultimately triumph than passive innocence. The intent of the story is good and admirable, but its simplistic and sentimental elements do a disservice to its issues."
3,This book is not what you think it is,"After reading this book, be sure to do some research into who the author is before you believe a word of his writings. He conveniently twists your ideas temporarily into being shallow, judgemental, and accepting stereotypes for truth. I am apalled to see this book reccomended for children studying American Indians."
1,"If interested in Native culture, do not read this book","Forrest Carter was a racist KKK extremist who manipulated the little knowledge he had on Native American life and culture, and sold it as a factual life story. Anyone who wants to learn true Native history should NOT read this book - especially teachers who use this book as a cultural tool for young children. Boycott this book and read something with credit and accuracy. Do not support a man who lied about who and what he was."
1,unhappy with seller.,"Jeewon was the company that did not send my order , charged to my credit card. would not respond to two emails to them.Amazon refunded my payment. amazon was great. not jeewon.I am not rating the book because i never received it from jeewon."
3,who are the real fraudsters?,"Jerry Kopel (a 22-year veteran of the Colorado state legislature-and a Jew) knew Carter in 1948. Way back then Carter spoke at length about his Indian ancestry. That was well before the Sixties Cultural Revolution,state-sponsored Multiculturalism and PC. So it was unlikely that a white guy in 1948 would weave elaborate tall tales about his nonexistent Indian heritage. Especially since the book wasn't written until 28 years later.Kopel's column is easy to find on the internet.Given that anyone over the age of 13 knows that most autobiographies contain a lot of fiction, ask yourself, who are the real fraudsters?"
3,Simplicity,Story was a sweet one about a boy and his grandparents. Their love was shown in such native Indian ways and the things they taught him of nature. It was disappointing to learn that the author was a very racist man.
5,"I laughed, I cried, it reminded me of my childhood.",I loved this book. It reminded me so much of my childhood. Days when things where sweet. No TV so we would sit out back a quote James Whitcomb Riley. I could see my grandma and grandpa as these people were. Mr. Carter will be in my heart forever.
1,Go to the real website!,I guess I didn't read the fine print. I should have gotten it from the official website. I got a USED but paid for a NEW price plus shipping. Just be careful these days. Here is the real website [...] Good Luck!
2,"A good story, but poorely written",It's hard to get into because of the tediousness of the language and the time spent describing the sea and the boat. Conrad foreshadows this book into the ground.
1,Pip-Squeak,This mimi cabasa was a waist of money. It produces very little sound. I regret having bought it. I expect that a larger version of the same instrument would be a good buy.
1,Disappointed,We can't load this - part way through loading we get an error and abort message. The soft ware must be currupt.
4,Office 97 Pro,"This is a good program, it has all the basics needed for an average user. Easy to use and learn, even for the most novice user. Installing over XP may require several restarts of the set up program, however."
5,Great for general home use!,I used Office 95 for years but needed to upgrade. I use word and excel a lot but don't have a need for all the fancy stuff. The features that were upgraded in this version are perfect for what I need! I highly recommend this version for simpletons like myself.
1,Upgrade only-no money or refund info from bigbuys yet,"I missed the other one star review, this is an upgrade only. NOT AS DESCRIBED.Do not buy unless you just want an update to Office 97.BigBuys has only responded by requesting my phone number. That was five days ago!!!!Will I ever see my money again??????"
3,Misleading,"The editor classifies every theatre that submitted a self-description by his deadline as a ""major"" festival, and every theatre that didn't as a ""minor"" festival. So some top companies, including Shakespeare Theatre of DC, the Old Globe of San Diego, and Chicago Shakespeare, are found in the ""Minor Festivals"" section of the book. And you wade through a number of unpaid, technically community theatres in the ""Major Festivals"" first. This doesn't serve the reader as well as it may serve some editorial vendetta."
3,"the title-track, not the entire album","""New York avec toi"" sert d'illustration au film à succès ""Marche à l'ombre"". Ecoutez-donc Renaud et vous découvrirez l'humeur des banlieues franaises.Pour le reste, je rvais d'un autre ""Téléphone"".The EMI-years were better than the Virgin ones."
1,don't waste your money,"This is an overpriced plastic bag. the camera could not be quickly inserted into the bag and secured in any position that would allow one to actually take a picture! Also, because the camera is not secured, every time the lens opens, when it extends outward it hits the glass at the front of the case and won't fully extend; After returning the package, I still hear noises from the camera that leave me wondering whether attempting to use this product has permanently damaged my camera."
5,Great product for the money!,I bought this mattress topper to add some additonal comfort for guests on my camper. I decided to try it out for a night myself & was pleasantly surprised. GREAT PRODUCT for the $$! I would definitely recommemd for anyone with a camper or a regular mattress they want to add a little comfort!
5,Love it!,"I was a little worried about food sticking in these after reading the other reviews, but I didn't have that problem at all! I made pumpkin muffins in them and they came out great. The muffins poped right out, leaving just a tiny residue, even though I forgot to spray them with cooking spray first! I just soaked them for a while and wiped them clean, easy as pie! I love these because I am always running out of paper liners at the wrong time and I hate throwing out all that paper anyway. I can't wait to make more muffins!"
3,Pretty but Hard to clean,"these silicon cups come in 4 pastel colors: blue,pink, yellow and green.they look pretty but they are hard to clean, even if you put it in the dishwasher little tiny bits are left in the folds. also when you serve it to people you gotta make sure they don't accidentally throw it in the garbage or loose them.i personally like the paper cups better, use 'em and toss 'em.MiMi x)"
5,No problem here! Great for Weight Watchers bakers!,"Look, I'd rather use paper liners, too. But I bake low-fat Weight Watchers recipe muffins and they stick like mad to the paper. I got these with a 50% off coupon from Michaels (ergo, $5). Directions say wash first in hot, soapy water (check), dry thoroughly (check), Spray with non-sticking cooking spray (I put a drop of vegetable oil in each one and spread that out with my fingers) Muffins didn't stick, soaked the cups, washed with soapy sponge (check). Perfect.I have used them many, many times and no staining. I love this product. I just hope that silicone really is SAFE...Jane"
5,fun,these work well for muffins. My daughter also likes to experiment and make frozen treats in them. They peel off easily and wash well!
3,Environmentally friendly but difficult to clean,"I bought these to save money on the ""disposable"" muffin cups, however, I wasted much more time, energy, and water/electricity trying to get these things clean. Scrubbing and scrubbing and scrubbing is the only way to get them clean. You cannot simply toss them in the closed utensil cage of your dishwasher and get them clean. I had to wash these things three times or more to get them clean. Also they tear easily. Do you really want a piece of silicone in your muffins/cupcakes?I have gone back to good old paper muffin cups."
1,RCA 111 is much better,"I got two Terks, the 525 and the RCA 111 and tested all 4 for number of signals and for signal strength. The cheapest (111) came out head and shoulders above the rest. Not only did it receive 3 more channels than any other, but the signals were stronger. Plus, I save on electricity because I don't have to plug in the 111. I returned the 525 with a big grin on my face. $5 antenna and great signals from 25-30 miles!"
4,Works good,For a digital antenna it works great and the boost adds to the power that helps get in some more channels.
1,No good,wasnt a good tv antenna because the reception wasnt as good as i wanted it to be. threw it away.
2,Amplified TV Antenna,"The antenna works okay on about five channels in my area. It frequently loses the signal. The problem could be location, not sure."
1,Zero Digital Channel Reception,The RCA Amplified Indoor Antenna was a complete disappointment. I tried it in upstate New York (about a hour outside Albany) and it failed to pick up any digital TV channels and I returned it. Even my original rabbit ears antenna picks up two digital channels.
2,didn't really help,"didn't see any difference compare with my rabbit ears that come with my TV... tried many different locations, directions, angles, still receive same amount of channels ..."
4,Good,"We are very satisfied with this item. Initially it took few etc minutes to set it to work properly but then when we finally did, the quality of channels has improved.We dont use cable/dish so this helped in amplifying the news channel the most"
4,Great product.,"Excellent antenna, I wish I knew about amplified antennas a long time ago! I used to get some channels pretty good and now they're totally clear. And I used to get some channels not so good, with a lot of fuzz and snow, but now they're pretty good. Highly recommend investing in one of these. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is becasuseI saw a generic brand one for less cost, but RCA is good, so I'm glad I bought it."
3,"good reception, but attached coax cable","i tried four antennas for my hdtv, and this one was giving the best reception, but it has an attached ~4ft coax cable, meaning that I can't put the antenna farther than that from the TV. I think I'm going to return it."
2,no difference vs rabbit ears,"We our in the western burbs of Chicago, in a wooded area, so OTA reception has been a challenge for years. Now with the DTV transition, our upstairs bedroom TV has no cable connection and was doing ok with OTA analog. After the digital transition, reception was blank screen.Read the reviews and bought the RCA indoor antenna - NO change vs the VHF rabbit ears or UHF loop.BTW - most folks do not realize that the analog TV signals were mostly VHF freqs, and the digital TV signals are mostly much higher in the UHF freqs, so that they both could co-exist for several months if not years.SO... your DTV reception will pretty much mimic your old UHF reception."
2,Bad product,"This antenna did not help. My area does not pick up a signal that well, but it did not work better than an older antenna i have been using for a long time. Only thing going for this product is the look of it..."
3,Good Enough!,"First, I'd like to make it very clear that this is a great set for the price. The knives work fine for what I need, and the block is small enough that it doesn't take up a lot of counter space.However, there wasn't enough slots in the block for all of the knives. In addition, the meat fork is pretty weak and flexible (and probably going in the trash). The knives also are pretty thin and flimsy. I'm not scared of them breaking, but when it comes to the sawing/back and forth motion when cutting raw meat, they do a lot of bending. Even so, they seem to work well on cooked product.Having said that, if you aren't going to use them every day, I think these are a great buy. If you are someone who is going to be doing a lot of cutting and will be using them every day, I suggest spending double and buying a little bit better of a set.For quality they get 3 stars."
2,not a big fan of these knives,"All I can say is, you get what you pay for. Very cheaply made - they rust and are dangerous when they break."
4,Cleaner than conventional mopping!,"The dirty water coming out of this was disgusting! I really can see how much cleaner my floor is with this Floor Keeper now! There are some minor ""discrepancies"" but I think that is with every product:*Kinda loud during use*Small dirty water container, no indicator of when it was fullOverall it does the job for me, my floor is much cleaner than if I was just pushing a mop around it."
2,Almost good,"The Dirt Devil Floor Keeper could be great. Unfortunately, it is unbalanced in the upright position and something breaks every time it falls over. After a year of use and some waterproof tape to hold broken parts together; it is beginning to spew solution out regardless of where the foot pedal is positioned.On the other hand, it has cleaned kitchen and entryway tile and it's grout (all white) for a year (I have a large dog and 4 cats), the tile in a walk-in shower and the cheap vinyl flooring in laundry room and bathrooms very well. I'm now looking for a better quality machine, but it you don't want to spend a lot of money finding out whether you like a floor cleaning machine--this is the one. Just make sure that it is always leaning carefully against something so that it doesn't fall over-- and buy two bottles of the floor cleaner when you can find it."
3,"good, but has flaws","I just purchased my floor keeper about 3 months ago. We live in military housing and the floors are all tile. The floor keeper is convenient and easy to use, however it has a couple problems. First, the switch to allow the water/floor cleaner water to dispense is awkward and hard to tell weather or not it is on or off. Second, it is hard to clean the hair and build up from the lower compartment. I think the filter on top is usless, because it always becomes wet and dirty. It needs a little improvement, but is worth the money if you don't want to scrub a lot of floors by hand."
1,"Looks Nice, Works Terrible","This unit looks really nice. The vacuum suction is very strong. It is heavy. The wet mop and vac features suck. Water spills out everywhere, especially when the debris container is full. It is very cumbersome and heavy. But it looks nice. I puchased a Bissel Flip Mop and it blows the Dirt Devil out of the water. The Flip Mop from Bissel is simple to use and lightweight. The water flow is controlled via a trigger switch. Unlike the Dirt Devil with the badly designed foot pedal that doesn't work well at all.The price is the same for both units, I recommend the Bissel Flip It!"
1,listen to the other reviewers,"They are right - mine had all the problems the others mentioned, and the stupid thing was completely broken after only 2 weeks - it just quit dispensing any cleaning solution at all. This was a complete waste of money."
2,Like most Dirt Devil products - it works but not well,"We've always been disappointed with Dirt Devil products and the CE5500 Floor Keeper is no exception. While it does a decent job at cleaning tile floors and is inexpensive, it has too many negatives to keep it.The solution dispenser doesn't seem to work very well, I ended up spraying glass cleaner on my tile floors instead. The dispenser on/off switch is difficult to tell when it is on. The unit is unbalanced and will not stay upright in the locked position. It is very poor at removing the water/solution from the floor, I had to go over the floor with a towel to get it dry. This is the main reason it's going back to the store. But to get it back in the box I had to unscrew the end so I could take it apart."
2,several important problems,Since I retired I have assumed total responsibilty for cleaning the house and as a man I am always looking for the most effective (easy) method. The Floor Keeper is a great concept but unfortunately has several important flaws. These include:1. The machine tips over too easily when the water tank is empty and the cord in wound on its holder...it is just a matter of time before something will break.2. The shut off cleaning dispenser indicater is difficult to read...the only real way you know is when water is pooling on the floor.3. The dirty water tank only holds 12 0z of solution (the amount of a large cup of coffee) before the vacuum shuts off. The time you spend emptying the tank makes mopping seem quick and simple. Back to the basics!
1,Good Idea/Poor Product Quality,"The Floor Keeper worked well at first. Then, as mentioned in other reviews, the cleaning fluid refused to drain onto the floor to use the wet vac mode. Applying manual pressure to the front of the canister helped. After a year, some of the plastic parts started breaking: the bracket securing the left wheel, the canister securing catch. Also had problems with the unit falling as it failed to lock in upright position. $100/year is too much for floor cleaning tools."
1,Over rated,"I bought one thinking that for $100.00 it would be a great help around the house, wrong! The thing does not stand up by itself, its always falling over, to heavy on the top. It does not pick up hair at all and I have two dogs so thats no good to me. Save your money and don't buy this product."
4,O.K.,I was fascinated by his simple fruit desserts as seen on TV. Thatbook was not available so I bought this one. Not so fast as you maythink - but then - this is French cooking.
4,Fun & fast,"I love Jacques Pepin, especially in his lack of snobbery and his use of innovative techniques that take fat & calories out of food without using low-fat substitutions or sacrificing flavor. Proof of both: his unapologetic use of ketchup in many recipes in this book. One problem I have with his recipes, though, is that they are difficult to improvise on. It's true with this book as well as with Cooking with Claudine. But if you follow the recipes, the food is fabulous and easy to prepare."
5,"Great Meals, efficiently prepared","Fast Food My Way and his follow-on book More Fast Food My Way are essential books for those who love cooking, and have a busy schedule. I make many meals using his techniques, recipes, and advice on how to prepare wonderful meals. Many of these recipes are made within 30 minutes or less. I recommend the hardcover for durability, and the companion DVD's (get the set it is worth it). Awesome text from beginner to advance cooks."
4,Delicious Recipes,"I never thought I would be interested in buying a Jacques Pepin cookbook, mainly because I don't have the time to spend hours and hours cooking a single meal. But then I saw him as a guest judge on Top Chef, and he seemed interested in down-to-earth foods, which intrigued me. So I bought this book. I've made some of the soups from this book, some of the salads, some of the vegetable dishes, and some of the rice dishes. I haven't yet tried the fish, poultry, or meat dishes, but I will. What I've made, I really enjoyed: the food is delicious.This is not, however, the kind of book you can pull off your shelf on a night when you want to cook something delicious in a very short time. The recipes often call for special ingredients that you might not have in the refrigerator or pantry. But if you pull this book off the shelf the night before you want to cook from it, you can buy what you need. Then, I suspect, there's not a recipe in this book that you won't find delicious."
4,The Best of the Best,"Bought this book for my Sister... she is one of the best cooks ever. She loves it. Fast Food My Way is for those who want Great Food without a lot of time to prepare. Excellent Book, same goes for More Fast Food My Way. You are going to love both of these books. Jacques is the best."
5,He just keeps getting better!,"I've long admired Pepin and have several of his earlier books. This newest book (and PBS series) brings us his approach to ""fast food"" which I think is meant with a wink and a smile. It's only fast in the time sense! I'm a serious foodie and this is real cooking; equally useful for family meals or entertaining."
5,NEVER had a better cookbook,"In this fantastic book of basic recipes, Jacques Pepin explains so well that great food can be incredibly simple. I use it frequently, and often look in it for inspiration when working with other (less well thought-out)recipes. Quite a few of the recipes have become family favorites.The best!"
2,A great disappointment,"Love his show and looked forward to obtaining the book. But, and this is a big BUT, why do publishers think light green ink on a white page is conducive to reading? I opened to the Content page and it appeared blank. After taking the book right under a lamp, there was faint writing, but I couldn't decipher it. Tried to find a page number, and I wasn't able to since they, too, are so faint that they're useless. Granted, the actual recipes are in black ink, but the comments and cooking/serving suggestions are not. It's like buying a book without the author's personality coming through. A real disappointment!"
3,Somewhat dissapointing,I'm a huge fan of Jacques Pepin but can't help but feel that this book and corresponding PBS show were hastily thrown together to try to capitalize on the success that the hyper-kinetic chipmunk better known as Rachael Ray was having over on the food network.
2,Cooking,"I purchased this book at after a friend suggested it. I found it, except for a couple of recipes to be very elementary and not worth the purchase.... will most likely end up in a 'give away pile'. There are many better books available."
1,Will Never use,The receipies are hard to follow & was very disappointed.I love Jacques Pepin Just not this book.
3,HALF of the book is for desserts...,"I was expecting most of the book to be about meals, not desserts. The 2nd half of the book is mostly about pasteries, they look great, but if you are interested in meals this may not be the best book for you. I believe the recipes are hit and miss, as are most. From those that I have made I've liked half, while the other half were BLAND and the food had to be thrown away. I would recommend this book, only for the dessert section, otherwise I would not."
3,review of reprint,"This book is a reprint of the original text with some weird typo type errors but most disturbinglythere are no photographs and Rock was a serious, excellent photographer of native Hawaiian treesshowing long gone and full size examples of amazing and rare trees. The book itself is a classic."
1,steven seagal is a comic genius. who knew?,"music from the crystal caves. with poetic imagery like that in the album title alone you know you're in for a real treat. imagine yourself being whisked away to mr. seagal's recording studio hidden deep inside a cavern formed entirely of brilliant, luminescent crystal. tantalize your senses with the boundless sonic delights of some of the most hilariously bland and soulless attempts to cop popular musical styles since hasslehoff. this is the stuff of legends."
5,My review about Songs from Crystal Cave,I like this music it surprized me to find out Steven Seagal did music and when I heard the music on this CD I enjoyed it I would recommend this to anyone looking to listen to light bluesy type music. It's enjoyable and easy to listen to.
5,COCO'S Twitter Alert,"Move over Oprah, out with the old, and in with the new.....Conan is taking over...."
1,don't throw it out!,"My first impression of this cd was that it sounded like those radio ads for Bud-Light...way over excited...way too loud back-up singing...way overdone. It works for Budweiser because they know it's cheesy, and they're trying to be funny. (But I think Mr. Seagal is serious - yikes)The cd might have had more potential had Mr. Seagal parted his lips while singing, if Lt. Stitchie wasn't so hyped up on goofballs, and if Lady Saw wasn't there. This cd caused me so much trauma, I even started biting my nails.However...there is an upside to all of this. Aside from ""Strut"" being the grossest song I have ever heard, this cd does offer the benefit of humor. It's only after you forgive yourself for listening to it, that you can fully appreciate the comedy within. At the very least, it might make a good coaster."
5,Steven Seagal Music CD,"I was amazed at how good this Cd is! My husband is a HUGE fan of his (movie wise), which is why I purchased the CD in the first place. I was SOOO surprised and PLEASED with it!"
5,Crystal Cave,"Very good, who would have guessed that Stevan Seagal could sing this good. He should been doing music instead of movies. I rate this A+"
4,Surprisingly good,Been wanting to obtain a copy of this for some while now since watching one of the Seagal documentaries on TV. Very surprised when BB King was commenting about the Aikido Master's mastery of the guitar - and I wasn't disappointed. An excellent variety of tracks on this and some very capable guitar work. Why was the opener Girl It's Alright not a single - check it out on YouTube! Would jump at the chance of seeing the band gigging in the UK??
5,best blues,this was a pleasant surprise everything a blues album needs to be Mr Seagal's guitar playing is excellent love this album
5,BECAUSE CO CO SAID SO!,"The man himself told us to buy it so what are you waiting for? Grab this with the calendar and you will make Conan happy. You dont want him to be sad, DO YOU??"
2,Song From The Crystal Cave by Steven Seagal,"I was excited to get this, but disappointed after I listened to it. It's difficult to hear and understand what Seagal is singing because the music overpowers him. Sounds like a low budget CD. Would not recommend."
2,I didn't know that he also tortured cats....,Give this a spin if you must torture your cat with sonic disturbances that will rack the ears of most cats as being funny in the slightest.
2,Poor quality,"Bought this for Pickles the chihuaha and her sister Bambi, but will only be able to put it on Pickles as the material is a bit rough. Bambi has a skin condition and I am afraid this would irritate her. Otherwise, is cute. Additionally is a bit loose in places; my chi's are chesty but small through the waist."
4,The Silver Swan,"The Silver Swan is part two of the 'Sutton Place' Trilogy. It follows the fated Weston family, this novel being set in England during the eighteenth century. It has its basis in fact.Melior Mary Weston is the tragic heroine of this novel. She is beautiful and captures the hearts of many men- including the Jacobite Pretender to the throne of England. It involves many twists and turns to the story, and keeps the reader reader inthralled throughout. A definite must for History buffs as it is partly factual and nearly always realistic in terms of historical content.Many of Lampitt's novels stem from this trilogy with minor charactors and their descendants becoming the stars of the show. They are a delight to read, and piece together- like a large puzzle.Therefore, if you find that you have enjoyed the trilogy, there is the added bonus that you can prolong the magic by reading her other books."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"As a web developer I bought this book hoping to learn new techniques. What I got was frustration. Although this book contains numerous coding examples (mainly for use with Internet Explorer), only about 5% of them work (with Internet Explorer). Don't waste your money."
1,This book stinks,"I got this book because I wanted a good introductory course to DHTML. I knew little about style sheets and my scripting skills were not too great; and this book basically assumes that you know it all. It doesn't give any good examples and it's poorly laid out with useless sample code. This book should have been in color with a CD-ROM included, and it should have gone more into depth with style sheets and scripting. In a nutshell, don't buy this book. It stinks."
2,Out of date,"When I bought this book I was looking for something I could read away from the computer and still pick up the basics of the new dynamic HTML possibilities. I got what I was looking for. The book is easy to read and understand and I was satisfied. . .until I got around to actually sitting down and hacking out the code. The book is, frankly, out of date. Written before the final release of IE4.0, it misrepresents some of the methods and code available for Microsoft's latest browser. I can only assume that the support for some of the code was changed after publication of this book. In fact, a lot of what I learned turned out to be fairly useless. As if to verify this, I soon found that there were many updates to chapters on the publisher's website. All in all, it's a book with great potential. I would expect a new edition out soon - and when it comes it could prove to be a truly excellent introduction to DHTML."
1,Not very useful as a reference,"I think this book was valuable when I was just learning about DHTML. Reading it is like learning about what is possible, but you can't learn everything about DHTML. The author really just provides examples of what you can do, but he won't show you everything. Keep in mind that this book was published back when the then current version if Internet Explorer was (I thought) the best implementation of DHTML, albeit non-standard. And that's the rub; the techniques the author demonstrates are browser-specific and won't work universally, not even today. Finally, the book seems disorganized, and it is difficult to find what few useful examples there are."
3,Packard's version of 'Space and Beyond',"This is not among Edward's Packard's finest works, but it's still a good read. There is more of a fast and frenzied pace on this one compared to the more psychological 'Space and Beyond'. You find yourself being the tie breaker to critical decisions which could mean survival and sudden death aboard the spaceship. Some of the endings are really creative such as when your spaceship runs into it's own weapons after firing them at hyperspeed. Some of the other endings are abrupt and will leave you scratching your head. I actually reached the planet Altair but lost contact with the mothership. So I was sucked on board an alien craft. The friendly aliens came up to greet me and it was the end. Shrug. At least this book, unlike 'Space and Beyond', allowed the reader to, at least, reach the third planet of Altair. It was damn near impossible to reach at least one of the planets on 'space and beyond'"
2,The Third Planet From Altair,"Like most Choose Your Own Adventure books the choices you made don't always result in a way that makes sense. But this book makes more sense than most as you can, if you pick correctly, end up on the planet Altair.Earth has detected messages from outer space. The source happens to be from the third planet in orbit around Altair, a yellow-white star 16 light years away. The messages repeat themselves and are from an intelligent race but nobody can understand them.You, and a three others, are selected to take the spaceship, the Aloha, to seek out who, or what, is sending the messages."
3,Mixing & Mastering DVD Course,"This DVD would be good for anyone new to the art of mixing and mastering. In the mixing section, it gives a fairly good description of some of the techniques used. However, in the mastering section, it only focuses on describing plug-ins used in mastering. If you are looking for something on mastering, this is not for you. It seems as though they were advertising the plug-ins and forgot about describing techniques. But as I said, this is for anyone with no prior knowledge of the artform."
2,bad chemical reaction ...,"I like Yngwie and I like Graham Bonnet, but Alcatrazz is just not my cup of tea. The guitar work is brilliant and so are the vocals, but the poppy keyboards and drums really spoil it all.This band had no identity, sorry. Yngwie quickly found out that if he was going to take things seriously he would have to leave the band. In came Steve Vai and although he sounds more comfortable than Yngwie the band wasn't meant to last.Bonnet went on with the Impelliteri-project, but that would be just another stint with another guitar hero. Sometimes the chemics don't work, even with musical (read:technical)heroes around ..."
3,Alcatrazz - 'Live Sentence' (Universal),"Originally released in 1984,as 'Live Sentence' is a so-so live recording of the band's tour they did of Japan during that year.I've never been able to get into Alcatrazz at all,even though guitar wizard Yngwie Malmsteen was cutting his teeth in this second rate hard rock band.Some of the tracks here I thought were okay were ""Too Young To Die,Too Drunk To Live"",""Night Games"",Russ Ballard's(member of Argent)""Since You've Been Gone"" and Rainbow's ""All Night Long"".Line-up:one-time Rainbow belter Graham Bonnett-vocals,Malmsteen-guitar,Gary Shea-bass,Jimmy Waldo-keyboards and Jan Uvena-drums.Believe I saw Alcatrazz as support act for Ted Nugent around this time period.Take my word for it,as an opener,I didn't even notice Malmsteen.Sort of like a Rainbow wanna be."
4,Good Song,This is a good song... i have heard it a few times at Abercrombie & Fitch...the radio version is the best.
5,Easiest reading Bible related book I've ever picked up!,"I find this book hard to put down. It's written in dictionary style, you look something up and it gives you every passage in the Bible where that word, term or phrase appears and includes the passage. It's wonderful! I can't wait to pick it up in the evenings and wish I had it around when my kids were young, it would have been valualbe to use as ""well the Bible says..."". I could see this being a great tool for Sunday School teachers, Sermon planners, Vacation Bible School teachers, home schooling, etc. I just can't say enough good things about this book. I highly recommend it."
5,Don't pass up this book,"This book is informative on a wide variety of topics. It's easy to read pages, cover the bible thoroughly and I most especially like the fact that if I want to know about only one subject I can go to that topic and see what the bible says about it. This book is a time saving resource that will be both useful and helpful for those wanting to know more about the bible. After I bought this book, I ordered another one for a gift."
5,Encylopedia and Dictionary Combined.,This is a great resource for bible study students as well as those in ministerial positions.
1,"A penny saved is a pay-to-read ""article"" spurned.","Since my grandfather had worked in the mines in Windber, Pa. during the years referenced in this article, I purchased it. If I'd dug a little deeper, I might have noticed the total length of the offering - a scant 885 words.Much of the content could have been acquired free of charge through means other than a digital download costing several dollars.Perhaps I found irony instead of coal in this wasteful impulse purchase of a few paragraphs on the Windber miners. It's not every day, after all, that I get to write a review about a review. A review with a price tag, no less."
2,The Most Gripping Book on Civil Engineering Yet in Print!!!,Wow! Was I blown away with this book. I can't belive there was so much about civil engineering that I did not know. My persective on Adhesives will never be the same... WHAT A YAWNER!!! If you must read this book for your profession or education I supose it could prove to be usefull. And if you do I feel sorry for you. This book is a real page turner. (If you could hear my tone of voice right now you'd know I'm being sarcastic.) There's no naritive and the title dosen't grab the reader. The valuble piece of information for the usess of glue the author could of used is how to glue this book shut!
2,Sloppy knife,"I love Leatherman products, however, this knife is has about 2mm of slop built right into the blade. If you own a firearm you know what I mean by slop. I can wiggle the blade back and forth 2mm in its locked position right out of the packaging. This is not something that should happen in a knife of this cost. I am disappointed. The multi-tool aspect is less than desirable. In all, there are much better choices out there."
3,"They didn't fit - and price is for one, not a pair.","They are what are what they are supposed to be - they just didn't work for me. Price was cheap, but got less than expected. Shipping was more than the cost of the bolts but I paid it because I needed them fast - but then they didn't work. Probably my fault. I'm not informed enough to be critical or give a glowing review on this, but I think they are honest about the listing and they are OEM quality."
4,A bum with theatrical costumes,"He lives in a shack next to the city dump with a sick dog.Across the river where the posh live, there are tall buildingsand an pet grave yards in Hyde Park.No pets allowed for poor kids by the English housing authority.Some kids are orphans with parents, but these kids run awayand find their Dad in Hyde Park after a talk with the optimist."
4,Great nice and heavy hoodie,My father in law works as a truck driver and needed something heavy outside. this product looks to be true to size and looks super heavy and well made which is great.shipping was super long Would not order from this vendor again.
4,gift,I haven't seen the jacket. It was a gift for my dad and he says it is exactly what he was looking for.
4,Would recommend and purchase again.,Sweatshirt was exactly what I wanted when I ordered it. It is true what other reviews said of the lining being a little rough right out of the box. I just go the box and am wearing it now but will probably wash a few times tonight to see if that relieves the itchy feeling. But Carhartt is the best for work wear and warmth!!! No complaints other than the lining....so far.
2,Too Short In Back,"I'm 6'10"" and own a non-thermal lined hooded sweatshirt which fits great and should be identical to this one. It is not. Even though the thermal lined sweatshirt is 2X Tall, it is way too short in the back and is being returned."
4,"Warm, durable and comfortable","Warm, durable and good fit. Good Carhartt quality throughout, easy care and holds up well during rough use in the shop and yard"
3,Its okay.,"This jacket is nice heavy and warm. However, you can not wear it with a short sleeve. The thermal lining is incredibly rough and is only comfortable with a long sleeve. The back side also rides up the back a little and is not long enough if you have a long torso."
5,Perfect gifts...,"I have been an avid Carhartt fan for the longest time. These jackets will continue to keep me coming back. I purchased these as gifts for 4-H members and had them personalized with an embroidered logo and the kids names. I knew they would be great when I ordered them, but I am still amazed as to the quality of craftsmanship in all of Carhartt's products. They looked fantastic and I am sure they will hold up quite well for the kids."
5,Warm and Comfy Sweatshirt!,"I love these sweatshirts, the one I recently purchased was a gift for my boyfriend, and he loves to wear it as we transition into spring. It's warm enough to wear on a 30-40 degree day! They are also built well."
4,Featuring Stephanie Weir and Average Asian,"You'll like it, trust me. With Stephanie Weir's girl from social studies with a video camera and her friend. And the Asian dude makes appearances throughout."
2,Chris Rea -Farewell Tour,"I was just disappointed. I have been listening to him for quite sometime and love his music..I was not familiar with most of the songs, maybe that had something to do with it."
4,"Ah, Wise Guy Cookbook, Uh? ya, ya, ya!","For those who like their stooges trio, this is cookbook. Fun and rare, lightly seasoned with some actual edible recipes and them some others.What's cool about the combo cookbook is one can cook and remember the stooges films and remarks at the same time. See knucklehead!Buy this if you're a stoogehead or know one who'd love this!"
4,Social construction of family images,"I really enjoyed this book by Gillis. I particulary found the idea of, the family we live by versus the family we live with, interesting. I used this book to write a research paper on the social construction of family photographs. Are the images the photograph imply real? Is it an image the family has constructed on purpose? Gillis has made a lot of intersting points in this book and everyone should read it."
1,The Previous Review,"Well, I haven't read this ""book"", but I can tell you that the last review praising good ol' Morgan for his literary skills was written by Morgan himself due to the fact he signed it ""Morton J"". Considering the fact that I know Morgan personally (blechh), I also know that his father's name is Morton J. Rosenberg and somehow I doubt that Dad has even read this crap much less reviewed it. Just thought the readers might want to know. It's a fake review."
5,perfect fit,It fits the needs of our car wash facility.The brush is just the right combination ofbristles to clean the outside of our vehicles.I would definitly recommend this product.
3,Not a Stand-Alone Dish,"The taste of this spicy dish is excellent. But I have to take one star away because there is no indication in the description that you really can't eat this by itself, and I'm an hour away from a grocery store, so the convenience I was counting on turned out to be a big inconvenience. (Bread goes with this much better than would a starch or rice, by the way.) If you can get Indian (style) bread easily, it would be even better - I've had mine with wheat bread twice so far. I have to take the second star away because you have to buy ten of them, which will take up cabinet space for several weeks. It would be better for us if Amazon would offer an assortment of flavors if they're going to only offer case quantities."
3,Not Worth The Price,"This stool is decent and it's nice that it swivels. However, it is worth only half what it retails for, if that. I'm not impressed with the quality of materials or way it is put together. I probably wouldn't purchase again, and certainly not at $79.99 each."
2,Too much elastic,"I don't run around much and therefore don't need abundant elastic to hold my socks up. I don't appreciate having a sock emboss my leg. I buy Wigwam Husky Athletic Wool socks, instead."
5,Christmas Krazy,Dr Demento should play this at chistmas time if he doesnt. Which Im betting he does because that other reveiwer said he highly endorses this album. I unfortuneally wouldnt know for sure. Because althouth I am an avid fan of his cd collections and bought any I could find my radio doesnt pick up his radio show. It hasnt for years. Getting to the album its a good one. My favorite song is the one where the three friends and Santa Claus stay up all night smoking misletoe. Merry Christmas.
3,so so,The seam too is rough The sheet too is hard But the design really isattracts the person very much also is lovable
4,Good piece of the Dosage Series,"I have been buying the Doseage Series in reverse. This one is not as polished as the later two, but still a great video. It has all the usual suspects and great climbing."
5,Excellent LP With a Soft Bop Sound,"This LP is a good one to play for your friends that might not be into jazz. It also would be a good LP to help people that have made the mistake of embracing ""Smooth Jazz (yech!)"" It really captures the essence of bop without being too ""out there."" That's why I call it ""Soft Bop."" Yet that doesn't mean is doesn't swing. It does. I think the real treasure here is the beautiful sound and presentation of Harris and his generous sharing of the musical load with the other musicians. I have the LP, so I can't speak to the sound of the CD. I always defer to the vinyl in regards to the ""sound."""
2,false advertising and poor fit,"Got this for my dad's truck. He said he struggled to install it due to faults in the adapter requiring him to file parts of it down to get it on.In addition to the installation issues, it doesn't have the silver base as it shows in the picture here, and it is also not actually made out of wood.. it's plastic. Yet the description says it is wood material. Lies."
3,Feels a little better,2000 S/10 ZR2 fells like it gives a little more umph but still ot a hot rod by any means I also added a Volant cool intke that helps some too
3,"Good looking, but otherwise useless","If you really need to replace the shade that came with your Palm III, get this product. Otherwise, it is totally frivolous and has no real electronic value. It's a shame that Amazon will ship it at the price of electronics, though."
3,Slasher film in print,"Though I do not dissagree with the other reviews already listed,I feel they miss the point.Yes, this book DOES have one dimensional charcters doing one dimensional things, then getting killed in various gruesome ways(Chainsaw, Set on fire, Pickaxe, etc/etc...)But, this thing was written for one auidence and one auidence only-slasher fans.Crye cleary knows his stuff, so if you are in the market for a quick blood and guts read, here you go."
2,One-dimensional,"I picked this up at a used bookstore last year, and am sorry I did. It was a mindless slasher story, albeit with some clever metaphors thrown in (the metaphors are what give the book a ""2"" instead of a ""1"" rating). Character development was poor. I stopped reading after a few chapters."
3,General Hospital,"This album(now cd) showcases one of the hardest rock songs ever recorded, i.e. General Hospital. The rest of the album is ok, but this one songs elevates the album to a collectors item. I've probably listened to every rock song ever made and this one just kicks. I recommend this album as a Yngwie fan, but more so for ""General Hospital""."
5,Brilliant,"I think this is one of the best albums that i ever heard, malmsteen's playing is just superb, it has a lot of variety and really awesome songs like ""kree nakoorie"", ""General hospital"" and ""Hiroshima mon amour"" just to name a few. I strongly recommend it, you don't have to be a big yngwie fan to apeciate what a great hard rock album this is. I think is a must have for all guitar players out there."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this vacuum in November 2008. After my initial honeymoon phase (being happy about the cordless part), well I might use it every couple months now. I have 3 dogs and 2 cats, and all Pergo flooring. In the winter the brush on the vacuum does nothing but produce tons of static, making it impossible for the vacuum to suck up any pet hair at all. In the spring / summer, the little rollers on either side of it collect all the hair, so it must be turned off, picked up, and cleaned out every few minutes. I had very high hopes after reading all the positive reviews here, but unfortunately it just hasn't worked out for my living situation."
1,Worst vaccume I have ever had.,"This is a junk. It stopped sucking after a few times of use.Then, it started spreading all the trash that inside the vaccume. instead of cleaning my house, it made a huge mess !!! I was so mad when it started doing this.I totally wasted money on this. This vaccume is going to be in the trash can."
1,Lost suction power very quickly,"Its like my kid. It just wont pickup anything completely from the floor. I would have to use something else to finish the job. The worst vaccum I ever bought. My olderBlack & Decker CHV9600 9.6 Volt Cyclonic DustBuster Portable Vacuum Cleaner, which I planned to replace with this, does a better job, only I have to bend with that one."
3,"Great Power, But...","I just purchased the Dirt Devil Extreme Power Stick Vacuum Cleaner because I have some physical issues that make it difficult for me use a heavy vacuum cleaner and bend down to use a dust buster. And, although it does have great suction power, I've already had some annoying issues with it...1. I have 4 dogs, which leads to a lot of hair balls throughout my home. Although it picks these up, within 1 to 2 minutes it won't pick anything up anymore because the hair gets caked into the vacuum brush - so I have to keep stopping to pull the hair out.2. The ""deposit cup"" is pretty small - I can only do about 1/4 of a room before it's full.Now, if you don't have a lot of pet hair to deal with, and plan to use this for smaller jobs, I would recommend it (like I said, the suction power is excellent), but if you have a lot of pet hair in your home, I would pass on this vacuum."
2,Would not buy it,I bought this product after reading the reviews and was very disappointed. Its power didnt last more than 20-30 mins even after charging it all the time.The most irritating factor was the dirt falling off from it while lifting it or even while placing it on its stand/Charger. I would definitely not recommend it and I am returning my vacuum cleaner.
3,Mine died after 11 month,"Does not pick up big items and runs out of energy after 10-12 min. Still, is very convenient and easy to use for a quick clean up: dust, pet's hair, tiny crambs. I will probably buy another one"
1,Not worth your money or time,"This little Devil stopped working within a month. Money wasted and who has time to deal with shipping a $50 product back and hope to see your money again? No suction, the brush stopped turning, but worse, it caught bits of cat litter in the wheels and scratched my floors - a lot. It gets worse - I'm going to toss it - more plastic in the landfills and a battery to remove and hopefully find a place to take it to be properly disposed of. What a waste - shame on Dirt Devil for putting more junk in the environment."
2,Cordless Vacuums Stink,"I keep trying cordless vacuums, hoping for a good one and still haven't found one. This doesn't have ""extreme power"" like Dirt Devil claims. Take my advice: don't buy a cordless."
1,"Useless, crappy","It doesn't do anything! the first time I used it, all of the debris was clogged in the brush and the chute, nothing in the plastic container. No suction. Returned it."
1,"It's not ""extreme power","I own this one almost half year. It stack just little peace of wood , boys toys ather staff. Also it is NOT warking any suckshion. Do't buy it. Just waste money."
1,this vacuum cleaner just can't do the job,"can't pick up the dirt even with full power, and full power only last for 2.5 rooms, useless against pet hairs :( but the cordless idea is very nice."
1,Not good,"This unit came highly recommended on this site, but I gotta say, I have been disappointed and frustrated with its performance. I have to go over a fleck of dirt 3 times or so on a tile floor to get it up. Sometimes the sweeper just pushes a speck along in front of it and I have to chase it down. Our little Black and Decker cyclonic hand vac does a better job. The old Hoover electric broom was excellent and lasted about 30 years. Now I am going to give a corded lightweight Hoover a try."
1,This vacuum is a piece of garbage!,"This vacuum does not pick up anything but a small amount of dust. If you need it to pick up something as big as cat litter, forget it. It appears to pick up animal hair but if you turn it over and look at the brush, the hair is just wrapped around the brush, not sucked up into the tank. This was a total waste of money."
5,Finally ! A Cordless that really works...,"I LOVE this vacuum! I have two cats with enough cathair for 6 more... I have bought every cordless stick that has hit the market and each and every one was a 'dirt relocator', they took cat litter from one place and relocated to another. Not one had the power to pick anything up. This one not only picks up formerly relocated litter but removes cat hair from carpet almost as well as my electrolux does.It's true that it's collection bin is a bit small, but as a cordless it's used daily, an ""in betweener"" per se, certainly NOT recommended for major escavations that require hardhats and heavy machinery!If I got commission for every one I recommended, I would own the damnn company!You think I'm too enthusiastic and should get a life? Ok so maybe I need to get out more... but until I do, I swear it's the best money I spent this year!"
3,handy but has quirks,"It works fine. The suction is good and the battery lasts long enough to do an entire house. The only hassle about it is that you have to clean the filter after each and every use and after each room if you're doing an entire house. The suction, though adequate for a stick-vac, isn't all that powerful and the filter is so small that it clogs quickly. It's nice though because the dust bucket is transparent and you know when when you have to stop and clean the filter because when the filter's clear the dust spins around like a cyclone. When the dust stops spinning, it's time to clean the filter. You have to constantly watch the dust bucket though. If you get lost in the moment and don't pay attention and then suddenly notice the dust isn't spinning, you won't know exactly when the suction stopped and you might have to re-do the whole thing. It works great for small jobs like crumbs and dirt tracks though."
2,Not an everyday vacuum,"I bought this vacuum because of the great reviews everyone gave on this site. After getting the vacuum and being disapointed, I went through all of the reviews again. It seems that many who use this vacuum can't really handle the size of bulky regular vacuums. Hence, the most people focus on its portability and decent suction for size.Unfortunately, this is much weaker than a typical $50 upright plugged in vacuum. It has difficulties with corners and hair. Any hair longer than 4 inches is likely to get in the brush.I agree that this is a nice vacuum for those quick spills...but there's no way this is adequate to clean a home. If you can handle a normal vacuum, go with those for now.Dirt Devil is still needs to iterate on this one."
2,a little weak,"First, it is great having a cordless product, it makes cleaning small amounts almost instantaneous. The problem is the thing has very little suction. The rotating bristles can be stopped easily with just light pressure from your finger tips so I suspect that as I'm vacuuming carpet the bristles stop spinning.The vacuuming on the hardwood floor is also not very powerful, you have to go over a piece of dog fur directly to get it up and when you're through you see lots that it left behind. I'm looking at the black and decker model next."
1,Worked great for first month,"This was a great stick vacuum. It saved me so much time as I have a little one but aftera short time, it didn't pick up as well. The crumbs would pick up with the rotating brush but when I turned the power off and lifted it, all the crumbs came right back out! I do NOT recommend this vacuum."
1,"A big, fat waste of money!","I bought this cordless vacuum for quick pick ups. I thought I would buy the more expensive one because I thought it was more powerful. It is a joke. It picks up MAYBE half of the crumbs off our hardwood floors and just pushes the cheerios around the floor. We have young children and I thought it would be nice and fast - trust me, you'd be better off picking every little crumb off the floor with your hands than using this!"
1,Not worth it,"I bought this for my apartment and have been really disappointed. My floors are almost all hardwood except for one 9 x 11 area rug. It barely picks up the dust and hair from the wood floors and on the rug all it does is roll around the dirt into little piles that I have to later pick up. The suction is so poor that when I cleaned up from removing our Christmas tree, I gave up on it and used a broom instead. I kept it on the charger as per the manual and felt after 5 minutes of using it, it had to be charged again. The dust container was small and had to be emptied quite often. The only redeeming quality of this thing is that it's cordless, but I'd rather have a corded vacuum that actually cleans than this!"
3,not impressed,"the vacuum is lightweight and convenient to use, but has very little suction power to begin with, and loses it in a short amount of time. also, the rotating brush stops spinning periodically. works ok for VERY small jobs."
5,I love it.,Great vacuum. I love it and my daughter and friend like it so well that he is going to buy one too. Very handy and works really well on both floors and rugs.
2,Disappointed....,"I bought the Power Stick Vacuum in order to have something handy for in-between quick pickups of cat hair and scattered litter off my linoleum. It does okay on the cat hair, but I was disappointed to find that it does not pick up bits of litter or much of anything else."
5,Dirt Devil Power Stick,I have been using this vacuum for about one month and am completely satisfied. It cleans carpet very as well as hard flooring. The 14 volt battery provides plenty of power with excellent life per charge. The charging platform is very handy.
5,Great product,"I agree with many of the other reviews. This vacuum does a great job. I bought it to pick up pet hair from my hard floors. It works great, is lightweight and convenient. As others have said the only negative is how often you have to empty the waste container. Overall it's well worth the money."
1,Way below par,I bought the Dirt Devil Extreme Power Stick Vacuum to pick up the spilled dry cat food that our cats and kittens leave around their dishes. It picks up the food and then blows it all over the kitchen floor making a bigger mess. It picks up hair alright but isn't up to the task as you have to empty it frequently and the beater brush is left with most of it.A good idea that needs much improvement.
5,Dirt Devil Extereme Power Stick Vacuum,"Excellent Product. This vacuum is light and maneuverable and quite powerful for its size. The dirt dump is very easy. We originally bought it to go on our boat, but so far we have not been able to get it out of the house because it is so much easier to deploy than our full size vacuum. You can grab it from its convenient charger/holder, sweep up an area of dog hair, for instance, and put it away in less time than you can plug the other vacuum to the wall. We are ordering another one for the boat."
4,It is powerful...,"This vacuum does have the power to clean well on hard floors as well as carpeted areas. It is not a replacement for a regular vacuum, rather a convenient, battery powered floor cleaner. I am happy with how well it does on my tile floors. The only complaint I have is that it is very loud."
4,Good vacuum,"This little vacuum provides an excellent complement to normal vacuuming. It is not a substitute for a full power machine, but comes in handy for in between cleanups and stairs."
4,Good Buy,"I bought this vacuum for a quick pick-up of bird seed, feathers, etc. as I have 5 birds and they do make a mess! I use this vacuum at least 3 times a day on the carpet and it does a sufficient job. Picks up the light stuff much better than it does the heavier stuff. I like its size as it can get into places that a larger vacuum cannot and the convenience of not having a cord to get in the way is great. Good buy for the money."
1,Think again before buying this,"I actually bought 2 in one year. The first one worked well for about 5 months, then I bought new filters and even a new cup (the price ended up being almost as much as I paid for the unit.) It stopped sucking up stuff, so I took it into an ""approved"" service center, they took 2 months to tell me the problem with the vacuum is not covered by the warranty. But since it took so long, I bought another one, it's been about 4 months, and this one has stopped sucking, too! So now for about $150 in product and accessories, I could have bought a real good vacuum. If you need a spot cordless vacuum, look into the Eureka 96D... it has wonderful suction, but I can't tell you how long this one will last as I have only used it for about a month, but it has better suction for pet hair."
1,Downgraded rating - gave it away after 1 year,"I replaced my Bissell Clean Sweep - which broke after 1 year, with this vaccuum. I'm very glad I did! It is much more powerful and easy to handle. It works great on our hard floors, picks up kitty litter on the hardwood, even cat food from the floor as well as cat hair, human hair and dust. It also does a great job on the area rugs.I've had the Dirt Devil Extreme Power Stick about 2 months now and it seems very robust and holds a charge well (I have never run out of juice cleaning our 500 square foot apartment at least). The design allows easy cleaning under furniture and in corners. It is light and easy to handle, and the dirt receptacle is large and easy to empty. It's the perfect vacuum for hard floors!Editing to add: After a year of use, this vaccuum no longer held a charge or had any power. I cleaned the filters etc and that didn't help. I guess if you are looking for an annually disposable item this will work for a while."
4,Best cordless vacuum I've had!,"This is my fourth cordless vacuum in about as many years & it's the best one yet. It does a good job with dog hair, the others just pushed it around & it does a great job on the hardwood & tile floors. The battery holds a charge longer than the others -- I can vacuum the entire 1st floor (approx 1500 sq ft/mostly wood & tile) before I hear the motor fading. Dust cup is on the small side but that's insignificant."
2,Vacuum too weak to be useful,"The vacuum is too weak to pick up anything heavier than a grain of rice. If this is ok with you, go get it. Otherwise, stay away."
5,Works Great on Hardwood,This is a very convenient vaccuum for hardwood floor cleaning. I have a dog that sheds and it picks up the dog hair from my dark wood flooring. Very easy to assemble and use.
4,It performs as advertised.,"For what it is (not a dyson) this cordless vacuum works very well. Good suction, long lasting power, beater bar for carpets. For the quick cleanup, touch up or dust bunnies off the wood floor, this machine does it very well. I am very pleased."
4,Great cordless vacuum!,"This vacuum works great on bare floors and area rugs. I have three dogs who shed a lot and this vacuum picks up their hair with no problem. Also picks up dirt/sand and bird seed. It's nice looking and very light-weight. My 4-year-old can even use it. The cordless feature is a definite plus and it stores nicely and out of the way in the charger. I do agree with the other reviewers that the dirt cup is small but, overall it's a must-have."
2,No suction,"Yep; it's true. Works great for about two weeks, then loses its suction even when fully charged. At first I thought it was a matter of putting the filter and dust cup back correctly, which can be a little tricky, but no such luck.I bought this primarily for the kitchen and the laundry room (which houses the litter box) and while it picked up litter and bread crumbs just fine at first, it has since become completely useless. The only thing I still use it for is the carpeted stairs. I have a Eureka Boss, which is very heavy, and this one does a good enough job to not have to haul out the monster every day.So here I am, shopping for the next one :~)"
1,High hopes dashed,"I read lots of reviews for this and other similar vac products. I eagerly awaited my product as I have a bathroom tile floor that gets dusty and a wood kitchen floor that's always full of crumbs. After charging over 24 hours, the first use was fair. My second use (yes, after cleaning the filters completely and charging another day) was marginal to poor.So, needless to say, I am incredibly disappointed. I was not expecting this product to be anywhere near the performance of my traditional upright, but the fact that it cannot even suck up a little dust leaves me frustrated and annoyed.So if you are comparing this vac to other similar ones...don't waste your time. Seriously. Don't say you weren't warned..."
5,WOW..this is great!!!,"This dirt devil is so much better than I thought it would be. The suction is incredable for a cordless vaccum.I was replacing the ""Swivel Sweeper"" because the battery burned out. I did like it buttttttttt, after this Dirt Devil, there is not comparison. It does carpeting & floors great! This rocks!"
2,Loses suction,"While this vacuum is easy to use, it loses suction after only 6 months. Don't buy this to waste money."
2,Oomphless,It is good for picking up lightweight objects. We have had an infestation of Lady Bugs. They are not picked up. We either use a tissue or hand vac. Very disappointed.
5,great cordless vac!,"This vacuum holds a charge well, is easy to clean with and easy to clean out. It has two filters which minimizes allergens. My only complaint is that we could not find one of these two years ago."
1,Maybe I got a lemon...,"I purchased this item based on some excellent reviews here but it was a huge disappointment. I have been meticulous about cleaning the filter and cup, but the suction is very weak. It will pick up dust and tiny dirt particles, but anything larger (e.g., toast crumbs) is either not picked up or requires multiple swipes or is picked up momentarily and then falls back to the floor. I never expected a stick vac to pick up large items or handle heavy dirt, but this one doesn't perform even light cleaning. We recommend you preserve the packaging and test it thoroughly in case you need to return it as we did."
1,Don't Buy Unless You Want To Take It To Service Center For Belt Replacement,"Dirt Devil 083414 Extreme Power Stick VacuumUnable to order a replacement belt online or when I call their 800 number. Apparently you have to take the unit to a service center (which for me is 80 miles away) and then apparently they replace the working part of the unit, rather than just the belt. This explains why there is no instruction for replacing the belt in the owners manual and why I was unable to order the belt online at their website. The 800 number representative said I had to take the unit to a service center to have the belt replaced. On their website they essentially recommend replacement of other units belts every 3-6 months. Good luck on taking your unit to a service center every 3-6 months for belt replacement."
1,Save your money,"I just printed the return shipping tag for this useless vacuum. I could not observe that it produced any suction. Occasionally, the rotating brushes would force it to suck something up into the chamber, but this was rare. The vacuum is also not terribly light & makes a high pitched noise that is just as loud as our standard size vacuum. I tried to love this vacuum, but it just wasn't working for me."
4,Devil of a good machine,"I moved into a home with polished concrete floors and needed something to do touch ups on the concrete and the various rugs I have. I looked at many other cordless vacuums and after reading the reviews chose this one. It took the 16hours to charge that some have complained about, perhaps for those folks a corded one would be more to their liking.There are two settings on the vacuum one is just plain vacuum and another is suction with the rotating brush. I have found the best results is had if you clean out the debris chamber often and making sure the filters also are cleaned often.For the price this is a very usable vacuum. I park it in a closet that has a electrical and pull it out when needed. This will not replace your more strong vacuum but it will be very handy on those days when all you need is a quick pick me up."
4,Pretty good machine,"This little vacuum does a good job going frontwards but has little or no suction on the sides. This does not present much of a problem as it is very easy to manuver. Overall, I am very pleased with it."
4,"very good, but does not pick up raisins!",I needed something for quick cleanups after my 2 1/2 year old twins. It works great with the exception of raisins. So far that's my only complaint.
4,Great tour of Duty,"We have had it for two years. For a cordless I doubt you can find one better. It does a good job. Only problem is the battery will weaken over time like any other. Mine has lasted two years because I do not leave it on the charger, but only charge it when it runs down keeping the battery capacity higher and extending the life. I hope to find another one when the time comes. Every day use for two years is pretty good. I hope to make it to 1000 uses before replacing......"
3,NO REPLACEMENT BATTERY,"I purchased this vac a little over a year ago. My original thoughts were its just an ok vac... I've owned my share of them..I have alot of birds so i constantly need something i can just whip out and clean up after them. I've owned probably everyone thats out there. I figured i was tired of replacing them so i figured this one was a little more expensive it will last longer. boy, i was wrong..it just died the other day so i thought i'd call dirt devil and just replace the battery..wrong again! they don't make a replacement battery for this vac. I had already purchased the extra filters months back and now i'm stuck with extra filters and a vac that won't charge. I think this is rediculous..they should inform the customers that there is no replacement. what a disappointment"
5,much better than the Shark,"We need a cordless vac for every day touchup. I bought a ""Shark"" and returned it as being too weak & flimsy and purchased the Extreme Power Stick. It feels substantial without being heavy, it's powerful for its mission, and the drop in holder/recharger is one the slickest design features I have seen. GREAT JOB, Dirt Devil! Buy it--you won't be disappointed!"
3,Dirt Devil Extreme Power Stick Vacuum,"Prior to my purchase of the Dirt Devil I read other reviews but should have heeded the warning. The dust cup is very small and needs to be emptied very frequently. At the same time I purchased this vacuum I purchased a Eureka cordless stick vac at my local Linens and Things. The Eureka has a much larger dust cup and converts to a hand held vacuum. Althought the Dirt Devil and Eureka have equal power for picking up dog hair on solid floors, neither is very good on carpeting. The Dirt Devil costs more and does not have a replaceable battery which is a plus for the Eureka. Also, Eureka converts to a hand held vac which is very handy for vacuuming above the floor. I will be purchasing another cordless vac for my home but will stay with the Eureka. Although the Dirt Devil functions well on solid floors offers less for the price than Eureka."
2,A bit disapointed,I am not too hapy with the way this product picks up items from carpeted floors. On tile it is good. It holds a charge a long time and is easy to operate and clean.
1,dirt devil bagless power stick sucks...,"it sucks and it doesn't, if you follow me.do not buy this vacuum. do not. vac fills quickly, loses suction. it's loud.not worth the money."
3,Quick Pick Up,"Its fine for the purpose i got it, quick pick ups in between vacuuming. Easy for the kids to use."
1,A big disappointment,I got this for quick cleanups to avoid dragging out the larger vacuum. However this vacuum picks up so little I don't even bother using it. This product is a big disappointment.
2,My Swiffer Vacuum works better on floors w/o carpet,Honestly I could have spent my money more wisely. I have a swiffer vacuum that picks up better than this more expensive model. It doesn't suck up that well on carpet either. Not really worth the money. I found this same item at walmart for half the price and actually just saw this at our local thrift store for $5.00.
2,Kind of useless,"This is not a replacement for a full size vacuum. I have difficulty cleaning my 1 bedroom apartment. There simply is not enough power to pick up dirt. The roller gets stuck with hair easily. You also need to empty the canister frequently. I also missed the extension hose.It is fine picking up small amount of dirt. But again, you can do it much faster by hand. I am buying a full size vacuum to replace it."
5,A cordless vacum that actually works,"I am 70 years young and have purchased several cordless so called vacums. This is the best I have ever used. My daughter just purchased an extra one for a spare ""cause it seems every time we find something wonderful, it gets discontinued. She has several long haired dogs so it gets a real workout. It works well on carpet and tile, so perfect for those quick touch ups."
3,So-so,"I bought this vac only because of the great reviews it got here.I used it twice, and I am disappointed with the sucction.It does not get anything near 14 v of power. It's so much weeker than my 10 year OLD corded 12v vac. The Dirt Devil still cleans the hard wood floors well, but is almost useless on my very short-hair area rug.When I put my hand to check the sucction - it's so week by comparison with my 12volt. Did I get a deffective model?"
3,"Only one ""con"", but it's a biggie.","For close to a year, I used this vac daily and loved it. It's easy to maneuver and did a sufficient job picking up cat litter and various dirt and small objects. However after about 8 months I noticed a significant decrease in suction as it took multiple passes to pick up simple dirt/litter from hardwood and linoleum. As it approached the one-year mark, after 1-2 minutes of use you could audibly hear the charge drop off. The problem here is the rechargeable battery is not replaceable, so a whole new unit is needed every year. Supposedly the new Accucharge model overcomes this limitation, so I'll be buying one of those soon."
3,Not enough suction,"I did a lot of research before ordering this product and based on many other reviews from other sites it seemed to be the best. However, I was very dissappointed in the cleaning ability of it. I have had a cordless stick vac before, but after two years of use it finally gave out and I was searching for a replacement. I was not expecting the cleaning power of a regular vacuum. However, this has trouble vacuuming anything other than dust, especially off rugs. So, if you want it for light cleaning and getting tiny bits of particles and dust off the floor, this will do the job nicely. But it's not as good as my other one that was nothing more than a hand vac on a stick - but still had great suction power!"
1,TERRIBLE! WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"I am so mad that I spent my money on this product. The reviews looked pretty good so I went ahead and bought it but it was the biggest mistake to do so. The suction on this thing is TERRIBLE!! It is completely worthless! It doesn't even pick up the smallest pieces of crumbs or dirt. I can't stress how disappointed I am with this vacuum. I really wanted something that I could pull out quickly to pick up small ""messes"" but, believe me, this is not that something. I would give it 0 stars if I could!! Don't waste your money on it!!"
4,"Great for what it is - small, convenient","We got this for our apartment and have been very happy. No cord is nice, and with the charge station it's always ready to go. In our small one-bedroom it's not a pain to empty the small compartment a couple times each time we vacuum the place, the trash can is close. Only problem is that every 5 vacuums or so the rotating brush gets snagged where hair wraps around it. Otherwise, good power and small size is fun and easy"
2,Dissapointing,Cleans OK on tile floors - I use it for the kitchen after cooking. Leaves a few things behind. I've had it for about 3 years and the battery now no longer holds a charge. It is not replaceable.
2,Not Very Powerful,About the only thing this will pick up is pet hair and dust. It isn't powerful enough to pick up much else. I'm disappointed.
4,light & easy,"This little vacuum is wonderful. It's so easy to use every day on my wood floors. It does not work as well on rugs, however."
2,Doesn't do it for me...,"Barely picks up much before you have to empty it or it loses suction. I dont think you should have to empty the cup EVERY time you vacuum a small area. Suction isnt strong enough to pick up anything but dust and fur, slightly bigger or heavier particles are left behind or dump out as you continue vacuuming. WOULD NOT reccomend, I am on the quest for something MUCH better."
2,Poor suction,I thought this would be really great for in between vacuuming and for on my kitchen floor. The suction isn't very good and it has a hot smell to it. I still use it but I have to go over the same spot several times before it picks up. I do like that it is really lightweight; even my 3 yr old can do it with ease.
3,Worked well but not for long.......,This was a great little vacuum for about 9 months. Then the brush stopped moving and now it doesn't suck up much and what it does suck up it spits back out. Searching for a replacement now.
2,Not powerful enough,"I bought this product due to the price and good reviews. However, it does not have near enough suction to clean even a low pile area rug. It does not get any lint out of the carpets at all and you have to go over the same spot over and over again in order to get it just a bit clean and even after that, there is still crumbs there so I have to go over it with a regular corded canister vac which I was trying to avoid by purchasing this. Its best used for hardwood floors and tile but forget it if you want to use it for carpets. My little handheld Shark vacdoes a better job. Very disappointed with this and just received a Roomba for xmas so now the Dirt Devil just sitting in a corner gathering dust."
2,Doesn't suck all that well.....,"I bought this as a present for my wife. Read all the reviews and picked this one becuase of most of the reviews were positive (at the time). I did see a few others mentioning that it did not seem to suck as well as they would like. I chose to go with the majority that said it was great.Well, unfortunatley our does not do so well we have a 5 year old corded bissell that is falling apart more or less that does better than this one does. We use it for cleaning the tile floors of the kitchens and bath. We tested em out by first cleaning with the new cordless then following up with the old corded bissell. This one missed some visible stuff and the old Bissell picked it right up.We do love the idea of the cordless and the carpet brush. But just cannot live with its suction. So far Amazon has not done so well with responding to our inquires either. Hopefully that will change soon!"
2,Not powerful enough,"I have ceramic tile floors throughout my kitchen, dining room, bathrooms and hallway, so I thought this would be perfect for those last minute pick-ups when company is coming over. I have 3 cats that track tiny litter balls across the tile, but it won't pick them up. Although it's light and easy to use,I end up going over things repeatedly to try and pick them up. It ends up hurting my back and taking more time than it would to pull out and run the regular corded vacuum. If you have grout, forget it - it doesn't have enough power to get anything in the grout. On my floor it is really only good for removing hair and dirt from the tiles, even little dried leaf pieces remain. It also doesn't pick up very well on throw rugs or carpet. I waited too long to 'give it a chance' and now cannot return it. I bought the Eureka Quick Up for less, and LOVE it. It works as good as the big vacuum on the floors, even picks up the kitty litter!"
2,Good while it lasts...,"I bought this vacuum about two years ago at The Home Depot for my hardwood floors. It worked perfect for about a year. Then, the problems started. First, the suction was not as strong so I cleaned everything I could remove until it was spotless. It worked better for a while, then the spinning mechanism stopped working altogether. If it tells you anything this vacuum was sold in a yard sale for $20. I have gone back to a broom and dustpan."
5,Can't live without it,"This vacuum is worth every penny of the purchase price. I searched forever to find a rechargeable, small scale, light weight stick vac with enough suction to prevent me from lugging out the canister system so much. The handheld just can't do the job, plus this upright is easy on the back.It has great suction and the additional rotary brush feature is just right for throw rugs & carpet. My hardwoods & tile are spotless after every quick pick-up, so this was the perfect choice."
2,Weak vacuum that does not pick up lint/dirt,"I bought this vacuum because of the reviews on Amazon. I wanted to use it to clean up the kitchen (wood floors) once in a while and use it on our carpeted stairs. In the first week it was great. However its only been 3 weeks and the power is very weak. You have to vacuum an area several times just to pick up loose items. Its faster for me to bend over and pick it up myself. My dust buster does a much better job. Also on the ""bare floor"" setting, it picks up *nothing* on my wood floors. I have to set it to the carpet setting for it do anything at all."
2,Works great for about 5 months....,"I previously had a cordless vac that lasted about 2 years. I was upset that it only worked for such a short time. However, this model only worked well for 5 months. First the brush stopped rotating and then the suction declined. I have 2 dogs and love vaccuuming quickly throughout the house daily. I will try another cordless-I just won't get my hopes up high....."
1,Loses suction in under two minutes!,"I've owned this vacuum for almost three months now. When I first bought it, it was GREAT. The suction stayed steady while I cleaned for a good 25 minutes before the charge wore out. Now, I turn it on, start vacuuming, and within two minutes (seriously!) I hear the vacuum get much quieter and the dirt it's picked up in the canister goes from a full swirling motion to barely moving. And no, the canister isn't full and nothing is clogged up anywhere that I can see. Arghhhh! I just upgraded to a Hoover Linx cordless vac today which has a different type of rechargeable battery that is supposed to be much better. We'll see what happens!"
1,Not what I thought it would be,"Bought this to replace a cordless Shark thinking the reviews made it sound even better. It will be back to the Shark for us. This picks up hair, but leaves most heavier items (like sidewalk salt or sand) right where the vacuum is shut off (you learn to not shut it off until you are over the garbage can)...if, in fact, it doesn't just leave it on the floor in slightly smaller pieces. We bought it for quick clean ups on smooth surfaces, so it has not been asked to do the job of a better vacuum. I should have spent $10.00 more and had something usable."
1,I really tried to like this product!,"I purchased this vacuum several months ago based, primarily, on the good reviews written here. I needed something small, portable, lightweight and easy-to-use for quick pick-ups between regular vacuuming. We have dogs, so needed it to work on doghair. It works marginally on hard surface floors (we have tile) where there is only lint and/or doghair . It will not pick up sand, or other small bits of hard particles, leaves, paper, twigs, etc. The cup is very small, and the vacuum will not pick up lint if even a small amount of material collects in the cup. The cup must be emptied every few minutes. On carpet it picks up lint and doghair primarily by wrapping it around the brush. I have continued to try to use this little vacuum, thinking I could get it to work better. The concept of having a small, lightweightc cordless vacuum for quick pick-ups is super. However, I have now pretty well given up on this one."
3,NIce little vac but died soon,"I agree with the positive reviews that have been posted. I found this vac to be very convenient for quick pickups of cat hair, pillow feathers, etc. and saves you the effort of having to get out a big vac. It was also very good for quick tuneup duty on the stairs since it is lightweight and cordless.That being said, mine died soon after the warranty expired. The beater bar would no longer turn and this unit does not have enough raw suction power to do much good without the beater bar. I took it apart and cleaned out all the hair and debris and it worked for a while longer, but after the second time I tried this, it quickly stopped spinning again when under load. It seems that the motor was just getting too weak."
5,changed my life,I have a one year old and a sweet but messy husband and was sooooo sick of sweeping multiple times a day. We have hardwood floors downstairs and some small area rugs. I find that the stick vac can clean what I did every day MUCH faster and less tiring than before. I found the charge lasts longer than I have needed and the suction is good. I like the carpet setting for all floor types.
1,This is terrible!!,"(I would give it 'no stars' if I could!!) I bought this to replace my Shark that had a broken handle. The Extreme Power Stick Vacuum is TERRIBLE!! It's no more than a glorified dust buster on a stick. I'm so disappointed with it. I got it for my kitchen floor, which is hardwood, and it leaves behind far more than it picks up. As for my carpeted floors, it's barely a lint picker-upper. I wish I just replaced my Shark with a new Shark...now I know."
2,A big disappointment,"This vacuum was performing well in its first days. Very shortly afterwards, it began to lose suction. It didn't even pick up cereal crumbs, let alone kernels of unpopped popcorn.I followed the advice of another reviewer to empty and wash out the filter, but saw little change. It does a good job of getting up dust and hair, but I really wanted something for kitchen crumbs, and am not happy with the purchase. I had gotten a Eureka broom vacuum for someone else for less money, and that is delivering excellent performance over a much longer period of time, without emptying its filter cannister or cleaning the filter either. I had ordered the Dirt Devil because of the extra feature for rugs, but would not recommend it. I will be getting the Eureka."
5,NO HOME SHOULD BE WITHOUT ONE!!!!,"This very powerful cordless vacuum was exactly what I was looking for. Having two small children and a dog, one can only imagine what my floors look like!!! This is something to be used EVERY day. This is truly ""a mother's helper""!! It has a setting for carpet and a setting for floors. The handle swivels for hard to reach places. It is great for a quick clean up!!"
2,Soooo disappointed!..,"I bought this product hoping that I will be able to vacuum whenever I want and I will not have to deal with the cord. However, I wish I bought the ones with a cord and a bag. Like my mama always told me, ""Stick with the classic one, honey"". She was damn right. I live in a one bedroom apartment and this vacuum is in charge 24 hours-7 days. Even so, it really does not have enough power.The brush doesn't rotate anymore, it is clean and perfect, however it started to malfunction. I did not have a chance to clean my small apartment with this thing. I was busy, and a little late to return it and now I am keeping it.I am looking for another vacuum, in the meantime I borrow from my friend, she has a dirt devil, too. But hers is with a cord and bag.So, I do not recommend this product.If you want your place to be clean and free of germs, dust, buy a corded, machine or let's say a stronger one."
3,Its okay for a small home,"I bought this one last month and its working fine till now. Only problem is that once you recharge it(for say 12 hrs or so..) lasts only for half an hour. You have to recharge it again. If you have a big home, better not to go for it."
3,too much noise,"i'm not sure how powerful it it, there's this time when i tried to put my hand there and i couldn't feel the suction at all at least there's some dust in the bag so i guess it does something after all... the only prolem i have is that it cause too much noise i just feel like all its power goes more the the noise rather than the dust"
1,Horrible!,I just printed my return and sent this useless thing back!The suction is terrible.What little it did manage to pick up it spit back out. The worst I've ever used. I don't recommend this product at all. I'm going back to my Eureka The Boss. Might not be as pretty but does what a stick vac should~ VACUUM!
2,Not Tweezermans Best Idea,"I have shipped my scissor tweezers back to Tweezerman. The 2 arms began to wiggle immediately after I purchased them, making it impossible to bring the 2 ends together and grab on to a hair.Tweezerman Scissors were like gold around my house when I was growing up. If my moms tweezers came up missing you would have thought it was nearly the end of the world. As an adult myself now I can sort of understand why one would freak out, I do it all the time now. Only problem is I live alone so there is no one to blame.I contacted Tweezerman about my problem with scissor tweezers and they are going to have a look at them so I will update this review as soon as possible."
4,Scissor Tweezers are easy to use & control!,"Wife has a small lightweight pair of tweezers with scissor handles that we have looked for years to find again and can't. This is the closest to them that I've run across. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, is they are not quite as light or easy to use to her old ones... but certainly the next best thing. These are really great, scissored handle tweezers are the only way to go, yet relatively hard to find for some reason. Once you try them, you'll be sold. Daughters have been after my wife's old ones for a long time, and ""no way""! Now, I'll probably be getting a couple more of these for gifts for them. Highly recommend."
1,"Shoody stiching, thin fabric",The fabric is thin and the stitching is terrible with threads coming out and gaps in the joints. I won't be using them anytime soon.
1,not creapure,Dont rely on the picture. This stuff is not creapure. It gave me horrible gas. Like non stop farting with the worst smell ever.
1,Not Creapure,"This stuff is complete and total garbage. They no longer use Creapure, yet most websites selling this still state that it uses German Creapure.I've tried many Creatines, and this is the worst. It'll give you sharp pains in your stomach, and you can actually feel your kidneys ache. Before any fanboys attempt to make light of my comments. The granulation of the Creatine per the description say it's micronized, but it has the weight and mass of sugar, it does not dissolve in a matter of seconds... it'll half dissolve in about 10 minutes. You'll have to constantly stir to distribute, and then it'll settle again. Most micronized Creatines dissolve in minutes into clear water. Not this garbage. Stay away!After receiving this and learning of the non-German Creatine, I took it once to try, got pains for about 8 hours... and then bought Optimum Nutrition's Creatine which IS made with Creapure."
4,You get what you pay for,"creatine monohydrate is a very cheap product, its around 6-8 cents a drink,, buy monohydrate and drink it with a grape juice, or anything non-acidic. I gained some size and veryy little strength from it. take 20grams a day for 2-3 days not 5 days like it says on the label, and take 5 grams wen ur training and 2-3grams on non-training days because u will just waste it if your not training it gets into the form of creatinine and excreted from your body- WASTE.. not bad to cycle a couple of times,, but remember everybody is different,, i gained 5lbs of muscle in 1 month"
4,really good product,this is a really high quality product. I've been using it for couple of weeks and so far I've seen good results..The only downside is that I have to mix it with Gatorade or something similar because the original flavor is not really tasty..
4,best CM i used!,so far the best CM i used...not grainy compared to other brand i used before...helps in firing up muscles during weight training...
3,creatine monohydrate,I have been using this for a month now and I recommend it. The pre-load stage was slightly bothersome in that you found yourself going to the restroom a bit more frequently than normal. I solved this problem by drinking this along with a meal.I did noticed a gain in energy on the fourth day and this helped my workout tremendously. I would not say my energy levels were as high as in my adolescent days but for someone who is in his early fifties this helped alot.
4,AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED,"I'd heard about Skolnick's jazz trio, but hadn't listened to them prior to buying this disc. I was betting I'd like it solely on the merits of Alex's playing in Testament. I was right. I'm no jazz guy, but I'm a fan of AST now. All three musicians are excellent, the arrangements are neat, stylish and precise. The 'covers' of Tom Sawyer and Revelations Mother Earth are impressive and the aptly titled Western Sabbath Stomp is nothing short of inspired. I don't know enough of the 'rules' of jazz to critique the originals, I just thought they flowed well and were interesting to listen to-- just what you'd want in something you put in a stereo. Check it out, whether you liked him in Testament or not--makes no difference."
5,Used Guaranteed,"This cd is used but it is as if it were new, when I arrived satisfaction was great, almost to a new low price"
1,The phone is very staticy,"You cannot talk more than 10 feet away from the base, if you live near power lines."
4,Blockbuster!!,"This film is the best review on record of what happened in 1967. The reviews that denigrate it don't answer the charges, they just distract. The FACTS and the EVIDENCE show that Israel attacked a U.S. ship in international waters and tried to sink it, for whatever motive. Some feel that it might have been because Israel, our ""gallant little ally"", was executing POW's because they didn't have the logistics to care for them. Others feel it that they were going to sink the ship and blame it on Egypt, thereby drawing us into the conflict directly on Israel's side of course. (where have we seen this before?) The detractors can't deal with the facts and this film PROVES Israel is a murdering, traitorous, backstabbing nation whose only alligiance is to themselves."
1,Simply doesn't stand up to evidence,"Friendly fire incidents resulted in over 5300 American deaths during Vietnam, 50 Israeli soldiers were killed in these mistakes during the 6 day war including 4 the day before the accidental attack on the Liberty.There was no motive for Israel to deliberately attack an ally in a time of war, especially when their forces were stretched thin. Capt. McGonagle of the USS Liberty even admitted the attck was accidental. If Israel really wanted to sink the ship they would have done so with submarines under the cover of night, instead of a partial attack in the middle of the day. More than 10 American and 3 Israeli investigations have come to the same conclusion the attack was an accident.The USA would never have begun funding Israel with military aid had they deliberately attacked the Liberty, all in all this film is for conspiracy nuts and haters of Israel, and lacks any real coherence."
2,be careful!,"I've ordered a few of these ata133 drives from amazon in the past few months. None of them have been ata133, they've all been ata100. I needed 133 for a RAID controller card and I was sadly surprised when both attempts to order ata133 resulted in receiving the wrong items. Two different sellers blamed amazon.com for the mistake, so be careful!If you HAVE to have 133, go to a store. It may cost a bit more, but at least you'll know you're getting what you need.Other than that....the drives work great. Fairly quiet and included software so windows will recognize the 200GB size. No messin' with the registry if you're using it as a back storage drive."
5,Fantastic,"Bought this drive last weekend and was reading a few things about it like that it was fast, but that it was a bit on the noisey side, but i have mine in one of those hard drive enclosures and i sit less than 3 feet away from it and i really have to strain to hear anything, in my opinion it is very quiet, and for the money i paid for it you just can't beat it, tech for less did an excellant job of describing the drive and i commend them for being a great merchant to deal with, i certainly will be looking their way in my future purchases"
4,"As expected, a fine HD","Reliable & roomy. (enough room for a small refrigerator, reclining easy chair & TV to watch feetball on Sunday afternoon)"
5,"A measure of clarity, at last","Alfred North Whitehead is, without question, the most original philosopher of the twentieth century. Unfortunately, his most important work, Process and Reality: An essay in cosmology, is almost impenetrable. This is not the first attempt to make Whitehead's metaphysics more understandable, but it is the best to date. Although Whitehead's goal was to uncover the structure of reality as revealed in human experience, his insights have been laregely overlooked, in no small part because of the difficulty of his text. Hosinksi has accomplished what many may have assumed to be impossible, namely, to make Whitehead's speculation accessible. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in metaphysics."
2,disappointing,"While the homes are very beautiful, they are intended for the very wealthy. I enjoyed many of the floor plans, including some of more modest proportions, but strangely, none of the homes illustrated correspond to any of the floor plans featured in the book! The photographs are very attractive, but for most of us, the uber-designer look and (ergo) expense makes these homes unattainable."
4,Tiki Tones What a Blast,"First off - who would ever pay over $20 for a cd that no one was interested in in the early 90s. I bought it back then and I am glad I did. Surfy and loungy and tongue and cheek. Good stuff good tone just fun. A couple of songs are draggin a little. But still great. THe second is even better.**Whoever is selling this cd, Fathoms Cds, Ghastly Ones Cds, Bomboras CDs, Huntington Cads CDs and most of the early to mid 90s surf Cds for over $50 SHAME ON YOU. You are not a fan. I hope all of this stuff gets reissued and the market drops out from under neath you like it did to sellers of Beach Boys stuff for crazy money.No one was buying this surf stuff in the 90s but are now - tourists!"
2,Unnecessary,"Look, this album is not worth the price being asked for used on Amazon. It sounds very much like 'Suburban Savages', only slightly less clever. Unless you are an absolute Tiki Tones freak, you don't need to pay $20 for this album. Go with the Suburban Savages album, or better, try something by the Blue Hawaiians likeSavage Night. Much better stuff."
5,Great Book not just on Argentine wine but on wine in general,"I work with Argentine wine, and when I wish to introduce someone who doesn't know much about Argentine wine or wine in general, I always get them this book. It is a great overview not just on Argentine wine, but on wine in general. Highly recommended; both the English and Spanish versions are well-written."
1,Avoid,"Avoid this like the plague. Jerky gameplay, few options, and bad graphics make this a less than memorable game. Instead, pick up Fifa 2001."
1,Not What I Had Anticipated,"After ordering and trying Fox Sports Soccer 99, I must say I am sorely disappointed. As one who never plays the game direct but, lets the CPU control both teams, I was appaled by the failure of Fox Sports to include this feature in their game. Since most games such as FIFA 2001, etc will allow CPU control of both teams, I assumed this would be the case with the former. Had I known this was not true, I would never have purchased the game to begin with. The graphics quality, which is a poor second to FIFA 2001, I could have tolerated but, not the inability to chose the way in which I control the game. I gave it a one star rating, but, in all honesty I feel it deserves a 0. I find the price of the game to be only attractive thing about it. And if it would not cost me more to return it than I paid for it, I would probably return it for a refund. In the future I will steer clear of any and all Foxs Sports games."
5,Moves air. Did you want something else?,"One of the facts about today's economy that I find amazing is that I can buy a powerful, effective, little machine like this for under twenty dollars. It doesn't seem quite right.This fan is among the more solid ones we've owned. It has three speeds, a lot of power, and oscillates without the creaky, squeaky irritation you often get from such machines.My wife and I sleep in a room with this fan on 'low', which works great to dampen sounds throughout the house, like the cat yowling, the boys prowling, the dogs clicking their nails on the hardwood floors, and the incessant flutter of bat wings.Actually, we haven't had much of the latter, but we're prepared if it kicks in.Buy this fan."
2,Oscillates.... sometimes.,"I'm actually a fan of Honeywell fans, but this particular fan (Honeywell HFT114B Oscillating Base Turbo Fan), I bought because it was supposed to oscillate. Out of the box it worked fine, but less than a week later, it often gets stuck, which is really irritating when you set it up before going to sleep, only to wake up in a sweat to find that the fan has gotten stuck blowing air against the wall.As a stationery fan, it works fine, but I didn't buy an oscillating fan because I wanted a stationery fan. Another complaint I have is that the fan doesn't point downwards, so if you happen to have it set up somewhere higher than where you want the air, you're pretty much out of luck."
5,"Very strong, well-constructed fan!","This fan is a great bargain. It produces a very strong breeze, and the oscillation function is well done: It doesn't squeak when it reaches the edge of the oscillation, like a lot of inexpensive fans. I don't know why people were complaining about the noise; it is no louder than any similar fans I have used. Highly recommended."
4,Honeywell small fan,"I have a ""vortex"" fan just like this. This is an oscillator fan and about the same size. I love the rotation and the angles the fan is allowed. I would say that the vortex gives a bit more air, but the honeywell was 1/3 the cost and moves 2 dimensions in airflow."
5,Great fan for a small room,"This fan is great because of its size - it's extremely portable but powerful enough to cool a bedroom. It's also very quiet, self-contained & sturdy. Much better than those huge oscillating fans that used to be everywhere."
4,"solid, powerful, compact, energy efficient","I was looking for a fan to use over the summer instead of the AC.Overall the fan seems pretty well built. I was expecting a quality product since it's from honeywell.It's portable, it has a soild base, it's powerful when pointed in the right direction, and fairly quiet.If I could change the fan I'd probably put the controls on the base or somewhere that doesn't cause the fan to tilt upward when changing the speed. It's not too big of an issue though. I'd recommend it over the large unwieldy fans that are more powerful than necessary."
4,good fan for the $,"for the price, this is a good little fan. i've had two of them for a while and they both still oscillate. i would definitely recommend it."
4,a powerful LITTLE fan,These fans are awesome little fans. They oscillate so dispersing the air around larger rooms is accomplished. I would be lost without these powerful little fans. I keep the regular ones and now this type on back up at my house since I live in Texas and getting through hot summers is tricky. The only drawback is that when they get dirty you can't take them apart to clean them. But for the price I just replace them.
4,It does what it promises.,It's a great little fan that does what it promises. I wanted a compact oscillating fan that will fit on a side table and powerful enough to move air so that I save money by not turning on the AC all the time during summer. For $20 what do the naysayers want?. I guess a freebee. Buy it if it suits your needs !!!!.
3,lacklustre,"My kitchen was very, very badly designed: the only window that opens is a tiny 12x12"" one in a corner over the counter. I bought this fan to pull air through and exhaust it. I couldn't find a box fan small enough to fit on the window ledge, and all round models including this one have the fan raised enough off the base that it doesn't overlap the actual window opening, so I propped this up in front of it. It does seem fairly directional, so being a handspan from the actual window opening doesn't seem like a problem.When plugged into the nearest outlet, which has a GFI, turning the control often trips the breaker which has to be reset. Turning the control from behind also has a way of unintentionally inclining the fan, as others have noted."
3,What do you mean it's not loud? Yes it is!,"A good little fan to be sure. Moves a lot of air. Absolutely, it is louder than most! I wonder what some of you are use to listening to if you think this is quiet?I bought 3 different style fans, all work for what they are designed for, including this one. But, it is definetely on the loud side. My larger Honeywell that was bought years ago (maybe 3 times larger) is quieter than this little train. But hey, it moves air to be sure."
3,Honeywell Oscillating Fan,"The fan is not big, but is pretty bulkly and not very quiet. The fan does not angle down at all; either strait ahead or strait up at the ceiling. Other than that its a pretty standard fan."
2,Shoddy construction and noisy as heck!,"Within 30 minutes of taking this item out of the box, one of the screws mounting the fan to the stand came loose. That didn't seem so bad, so I screwed the piece back in. I enjoyed the fan for a while - it moves a huge amount of air for such a small fan, but even on the lowest setting, this fan makes more noise than most box fans.After a month of regular use, the base stopped oscillating, and when I turned off the fan and picked it up, I heard something rattling around inside. I figured that another screw had come loose, but when I opened up the base, I found out that the screw connecting the oscillating motor to the base had snapped, leaving the shaft of the screw stuck in the rotating portion of the motor. Anyway, I now have a noisy, non-oscillating fan (that admittedly moves a lot of air)."
2,Poorly Designed,"The size isn't mentioned and was disappointed to discover it is only a 9"" fan, on a 12"" base. I was hoping it was at-least a 12"" fan.This fan is very noisy, really prevents you from falling asleep, even on lowest speed, which isn't low enough. There isn't much difference between the three speeds, Extremely fast, Very fast, and Fast.Speed switch on top, when adjusting speed the fan moves changing angle, must use both hands, one to steady fan position and the other to adjust speed.Switch should be on base.Base should have rubber feet, to prevent movement or sliding during adjustments.Would not purchase again or recommend to others.Needed a fan right-a-way, out-of-season and made a poor choice.When summer stock arrives at local stores I will replace this fan."
2,Disappointed,"I was so happy with this quiet fan - at first. The directions state the batteries will last 72 hours. I got cheated out of 70 hours, as mine lasted 2 hours at the most. Think about the cost of batteries before making this purchase"
1,Cheap and useless,"Beware of this fan. First it is really small, very noisy even at low speed and sends out a very weak, narrow push of air. But most annoying is that whenever it's on it tilts completely up - the resistance in the hinge is useless and it always ends up pointing to the ceiling. I didn't return it and threw the packaging out thinking I could fix it, but it's a piece of junk."
1,Good will it lasted....,"I bought this thing just to use while I sleep, and it functioned as advertised for about 3 months. However, it no longer even turns on anymore. I wish I could get a refund or have them fix it, but of course they make you pay for shipping.If a fan only works for 3 months when used only during the night, I consider it garbage. I have had cheaper fans that are still working after 10 years use..."
4,"Cheap, compact, no complaints","Just got the fan so I cannot comment on durability, however, so far I'm happyPros: price, storage will be easy, good performancecons: a tad noisier than i was hoping for"
2,It's going back...,"Just got this fan today. I bought it to help distribute the hot air coming from our fireplace. I plugged it in, and turned it on to the lowest speed. At first it sounded pretty quiet, but then it kept getting faster, and louder, and faster, and louder and LOUDER!!! Now let me tell you what I really think....Its way too loud!! I think the slow speed should have actually been the medium or fast speed. I was hoping for more of a whisper hum on the lowest speed, like most fans. But I think this one is trying to compensate for its small size by increasing the rpm's. Even in the hallway or our 2nd story, I can hear it all the way downstairs, through the living room, and into the dining room. Granted, we have hardwood floors, but that should give you an idea of what to expect.They really need to make this fan with a speed at least half as fast as its lowest current setting. I'm sending it back tomorrow and it's back to the drawing board. Too bad, I had such high hopes!"
2,much ado about nothing,"I bought two of these fans because they were suppose to have a lot of power for their size. They are a disappointment. If you want better air circulation, stick to the window box or square fans that one gets at Target or Walmart. The Lakewood brand etc.I am sure these Honeywell fans will last a long time and are durable but as I write this, the amount of air moved around is very disappointing."
1,Planned Obselesence?,"This little fan worked nicely for a couple summers of occasional use. Then it was slow to start up and now it doesn't work at all. It was never abused or left to run more than 6 hours at a time. Now it's worthless except to help pollute the planet. Nice work, Honeywell!"
3,Book is too biased against Intel,"It is not surprising, since most of the sources of this book comes from people who were sued by Intel or are competitors of Intel, that this book bashes Intel. In return, it only does a token job of giving Intel's perspective.This book does not try to be objective. It should not be taken as an authoratative nor a credible source of what it is like to work for Intel."
2,Very negative book about an overachiever,"The details are well researched, but almost everyone that is mentioned in this book is painted as a person full of flaws. It is almost like the author decided that he would do so BEFORE doing the research and writing the book.Intel is great company and has made some amazing technolgy possible for all of us. This fact is never acknowledged in the book."
4,Best book to read for engrs contemplating joining Intel,"If you are an engineer contemplating joining Intel read this book. You will have one of two reactions afterwards. You will be even more enthusiastic about joining a no nonsense, very well run company, or you will run like hell away from Intel. Take it from me, an Intel newbee, this book lets you know what Intel is all about."
3,It didn't meet my expectations,"This book is a good book, but I expected to find more informations about Grove's behavior and a kind of recipe to manage as good as he does. I suggest this book only for ones who enjoy computers or electronics and knows something about this tech-world."
3,"Expected so much more, but still an ok history of Intel","This book is ok. Good, but I was disappointed. Why? Because I feel it could have been just so much more and rich in history and anecdotes with less dry (and uninteresting) technical background. Intel's the world's largest processor company. Exceptionally dynamic and with high tech, cutting edge resources (people). More important, it's a look into the future. I thought reading this work would provide a privileged insight into this modern day paradigm of manufacturing and management. It was just ok. Good, but for all that we hear of Intel and see of its present day market dominance, I couldn't help but feel that so many pages just didn't do it justice. Bottom line: author Jackson could've provided much more content in the pages he used."
4,Fascinating Look Inside Intel,"I read this book on the advice of a colleague, both of us Ph.D. engineers in an unrelated field. Jackson presents an interesting dissection of life inside Intel as it grew to the leader in its field. Some of the details were astounding...I couldn't believe they occurred. I agree with other reviewers...if you want to work for Intel, you MUST read this book first."
3,"An interesting read, but too dry and narrowly focused","If you are really interested in how Intel looks from the inside out and would sacrifice that insight for some dry sections, this book would be good for you. I had high hopes for this book when I started it. From my understanding, there is very little in print about Intel in such a format. The problem is, the book is a bit dry. While it has some interesting high points and a sprinkle of humor, it ends up reading a bit like a coporate history, time-lined by every court case Intel was involved in. There is a wealth of good information, and obviously Tim Jackson spent a lot of time researching this book (and hunting down the people he needed to talk to). It is definitely a unique window into the strategy and corporate culture of Intel that I have never seen nor heard off, but I much more enjoyed reading ""Startup"" (a history of ""Go"" - a pen computing company in the 80's) than ""Inside Intel"". Frankly, it was just better written."
4,"Very comprehensive, if a little dated","I learned *alot* in this book. It felt at times like a 'way-back-machine', taking me back to the good-old-days of computers. It is definitely packed with information, and sometimes the cast of characters can be a bit large, but well worth the read! David W."
4,Very good,"Along with the ""Vault Reports Guide"" on Intel, which is full of quotes from Intel insiders, I thought ""Inside Intel"" was one of the best insider views of Intel."
4,good reflection of the current culture,Mr. Jackson seems to have resisted the temptation to take cheap shots. It's a refreshingly realistic interpretation of the Intel experience that is recognizable to the people whose lives are affected by it.
4,The Last Song,"This single is very good. Two of my favorite smashing pumpkins songs are on it. And the only way to rate this acurately is to do it song by song.Thirty Three (5 stars) probably my third favorite song from the double cd. It's has good lyrics and a cathy tune.The Last Song (5 stars) one of the greatest songs I've ever heard. It's well worth the money for this one alone.The Aeroplane Flies High (4 stars) a excellent song, easy to listen to.Transformer (3 stars) I didn't particulary like this one as much as the others but still not bad.So the stars average out to a 4.25 rounded to a 4.0 none the less a excelent single"
3,"""The aeroplane flies high ( looks left, turns right )""","... appears on this cd, it's a classic, 8 minute+ piece that at once is both typically pumpkinish and new. The Last Song is also quite good, a slower, lilting piece. Transformer is a pretty straight forward rock song that sounds like it's off Pisces Iscariot (which isn't such a bad thing). The Bells has Iha doing the vocals and is pretty. My Blue Heaven sounds lame even when the Pumpkins do it though."
1,never arrived!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I ordered this at the beggining of July with a promised date of july 2oth. It is now august 5th and it has never arrived!
1,What happened to my review???,I reveiwed this thing a while ago... Anyway... Mystry.. you knew right away what gonna happen but you dont' really care. Romance....what romance? After one.. scene the two fall in love... I'd give half a star or no star... Get it from the library.
1,The worst ever,"This is my 4th Karen Robard's book and they go down hill all the way.I hated the sex scenes, which were so insipid. No female could possibly respond in the way that Gabby, a Victorian Lady, did. It was gagging."
5,I liked it!,"I loved the premise -- masquerading stranger appears as half-brother, heroine falls in love with him and scandalizes London. I'd buy it again - which is my personal standard for romance novels."
5,Absolutely Loved It!,"I haven't read any books by K.R. before, but I am compelled to read more of her work now. Just loved everything about this book, and my face is still warm from finishing it!"
3,I've read better,"I have read all of KR's books, and while I was waiting a long time for a historical (which are her best), I found this one just ""ok"". It had similar elements to some of her other books (e.g. Dark Torment, Nobody's Angel), yet I found the story dragging at times."
3,Pretty Good,"This was my 5th book from Robards and although, not exactly my favorite, it was pretty good. It was a tad slow-moving at first, in comparison to the others I've read by her, but the pace picked up toward the middle. I probably had such a hard time reading it because I had just finished ""Desire in the Sun,"" a very fast-paced and action-packed historical romance by Robards. Scandalous, definitely not my favorite, but it's good enough to recommend...I liked the characters and the story, and I look forward to reading ""Irrestible,"" the second installment to the trilogy."
3,It was pretty good!,I'm not really into romance novels and there were a few sex scenes that were a little too explicit for me. I just skipped over these parts and the rest of the book was pretty good!
3,3 1/2 stars - Pretty Good Read,"Started out a bit slow for me.....Ok, Ok, we get the central plot....must have been stated and re-stated a dozen times....but about halfway through...started to get suspensfull and interesting. Good dialouge, good amount of romantic tension and though the ending came up quickly, was satisfying. Would definitely recommend as a good romance novel."
4,Great for both students and teachers of group therapy,"Dr. Fehr's book was designed for students--and is laid out in a most convenient way for them--even with questions at the end of each chapter. But, as a teacher and long-time practitioner of group therapy, I found it to be engrossing, well presented, and helpful. There is one especially interesting chapter where several guest contributors each discuss the same case fragment from differing points of view. This book is an excellent addition to the libaries of both students and teachers of the art."
4,Great introductory text on group therapy,"This text is a very good alternative to the ubiquitous Yalom text:Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy, Fifth Edition. Fehr writes in a much more concise fashion, with most chapters only 10-15 pages long. The book is split roughly evenly focusing in the the first half on models and empirical information and the second on practice advice and real world experience. Overall, Fehr presents a detail overview of the way group therapy should run, and how to do it as the beginning clinician. Excellent text for students. It should be noted, however, that Fehr writes from a strong psychodynamic perspective. Although he tries to embrace other approaches in some of the chapters, it comes through clearly in most chapters. Provided that doesn't turn you off the text too much, it is highly recommended."
5,"Had I seen it years ago, my daughter would have owned it","If I had encountered this book when my daughter was young, she would have owned it. The structure is a basket containing a white rabbit, chocolate rabbit, a chick, flowers and Easter eggs. These items are depressed, so as the thick pages are turned, the items are ""removed"" from the basket. The pages are very colorful and the ""basket"" items sparkle, features that will capture and keep the attention of young children. The text, which appears in captions at the bottom, explains the religious significance of Easter."
2,Not a Good Deal!,"This DVD set consists of one outer and two inner Boxes, each has 4 glassy DVD case, 3 double, 1 single. DVDs are not indipendent in this set, so if you want to buy it used, beware of the condition of the box. some movies like ""THE DOORS"" and ""Nixon"" are originnaly two discs editions but only first discs are included in this dvd set and worse is, there is a word ""disc 1"" printed of them which indicates that these are the first DVDs of a 2 disc set and that makes you feel there is something crude about this box set! and there is something really crude!the quality of boxes and print is low. outer box could easily be damaged or worn and it's very loose. it's not a good deal, specially at the price of 116 dollars!"
5,great disc set,"if you like oliver stone, or even one or two of his movies, this is a set for you. the movies are excellent, this is a great item for collectors of all kinds as well as any plain ole joe like me! The movies are awesome, they are displayed nicely, and it is a great deal for the price! A must have for a movie buff!!"
3,One of my favorite director's; far from ultimate box set,"I'll keep this short and sweet, as most of you have already touched on this before me. None of the 2 disc sets include their second disc. That means collectors like me basically had to repurchase the DVDs if they wanted any supplemental material included with their fave flicks. I found this to be a bit of a money waster, and basically an expensive way to purchase the Stone documentaries, that as far as I know, can only be found here. I'd have rather just paid 20 bucks for them on a seperate DVD, however."
3,Cottage Winds Chair,"Loved the distressed black color of the chair. This is not a heavy chair. It has small legs and wood work, but the seating area is very comfortable to sit in. Great chair for a desk."
5,Love this chair,"Loved the price of chair and that it came assembled. When it arrived, it was packaged very nicely and securly. Sturdy and comfortable chair, looks great in kitchen desk."
4,Great chair for the price.,"This is a nice chair--doesn't looks so worn or distressed as others in this style often do. Feels solid, seat is ample, yet it's not too heavy to lift or slide easily for seating. Very good value considering the price--highly recommend."
5,A feast,"The programme maybe disjointed, but it doesn't matter, because the singing is some of the most glorious I have EVER heard. A shining feast of articulation, phrasings and harmonies, heavenly executed by Ms Ciofi and Ms Di Donato.Just buy it for an unparalleled vocal chord experience; marvel at the singing. Any other considerations are entirely oblivious."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"What I liked: The eyeshadow base and concealer included in the pallette. That's really nice and rare, too.What I REALLY didn't like: There's no place for a brush! The brush was included OUTSIDE of the pallette, so it fit in the cardboard box, but not in the kit. I usually use my own brushes when I'm home, but for a to-go type pallette you definitely need a brush!The colors weren't great either because they all had gold flecks in them, so if you don't want gold you're out of luck with every color.I was hoping for more, especially for $28. It's a small pallette that I'll probably never use, it's too inconvenient without the brush.I got the 'minimum' and the 'mirage' sets, the 'minimum' has a better range of colors, no gold flecks, but still not great."
4,Very Interesting Book,"not for the prurient, this is an entertaining and sometimes funny book relating the ins and outs of boy love in samurai japan. the descriptions of the boys are priceless as are the innovative ways they are chased by their admirers."
5,An important and often very beautiful and moving work,"""Great Mirror of Male Love"" is Saikaku's longest work, and we would probably recognize it as his best, if homophobic critrics had not been throwing dust in our eyes for a century or more. It does not have a continuous plot--it is a collection of what we moderns would call ""short-short stories"" rather than a novel. But almost all of the stories are interesting (I admit that a few are not, but only a handful) and some of them are deeply moving. As far as I know this is the most recent translation of any Saikaku work, and it was published some twenty years ago--what gives?"
3,Letter Openmer,I was somewhat disappointed in the size of the handle. It definitely was made for a man's hand. I bought it as a gift for a very small statured women!
4,nice!,"Didn't realize nice letter openers would be so hard to find, but this one is very nice, was a gift and well received."
5,Judge for Yourself - Worth Reading,"I am reading this book now. I wish I would've read this book before I got married. Unfortunately, I am divorcing, but I can say that this book is a real pick-me-up. I am now understanding the role of a man and a woman in a marriage and now I know what to look for when I do get married again. The responsibility of a man in the household, How men and women are different, how to get past hurts and how not to be manipulitive. God wants relationships to have order. Work as a team under the guidance of the Almighty. Women and men are the same in the spirit, but they provide a different function. If one person doesn't fulfill their role, the marriage will not work. The love emotions will fade and it will end in disaster! Amen! I went through it. I haven't finished reading all the chapters yet, but I can't put it down. Decide for yourself, it is a real blessing to me. Thanks Bishop Long!!!"
1,Needs a New Title.,"In light of recent events, maybe Eddie should rename his book, ""I Don't Want Delilah, I Need Youth! What a Man Needs to Understand about paying off Young Male Victims."" Homophobic Hypocrite."
4,Great Job,"I have heard a few Bishop Eddie Long sermons, this book was great, like being there live!!!Try the Book"
5,"""A BOOK FOR EVERYONE""",This book was wonderful. I recommend this book for singles as well as married couples. I also suggest that men and women read this book. I learned a lot about the order of marriage through the Word that Bishop Long focused on in this book. I enjoyed the fact that Bishop Long's book was totally scripture-based. It's not too late for anyone to start their marriage or relationship on the right foot.
5,This book is of the hook Bishop Long is a awesome Man of God,"Any body thats single needs to read this book.It shows you what real womanhood and manhood looks like.And how the lords wants to clean you before you get marry.Bishop Long is a awesome man of god and i really respect him.Believe it or not he keeps it real, ""you know what i mean"".Nothing about him is waterdown."
2,Digital Camera,"The digital camcorder that I recieved is a nice camcorder but overall, it doesn't give the results that I would like, especially for the price I paid I could have actually got a larger camcorder for if not the same or lesser price. The camcorder pics online makes it seems as big as your hand but it's actually smaller than a digital camera. I was disappointed with what I recieved but, I like the pictures that it takes...,another disappointing factor is the amount of recording memory it holds, horrible. I will have to upgrade camcorders within a few months."
5,my 5 year old can use it!,"I bought this for my husband who is deploying next month. We took it with us to some caves to test it out and my 5 year old worked it the whole time. I was so impressed with its battery time (lasted over 3 hours) and it is so easy to use ( my 5 year old was a pro at it with little instruction). I think the quality of the pictures and video were really good espically since it doesn't have a light and we used it in some of the caves. The small size was great, I could put it in my purse or my husband put it in his shirt pocket. He is really looking forward to using the MP3 player on the trip overseas and the web camera. I highly recommend this little device especially for the price."
5,Authentic!,"Authenticity is the best word to describe Connie Cavanaugh. In this book, Connie humbles herself by sharing how her relationship with God was a farce, and then explains in practical ways how she truly found God's grace.Many of us are exactly where Connie was - just going through the motions of our faith, too embarrassed to confess it. I challenge you to read this book and discover God's grace just for you!"
3,"half good, half bad","The first half of the book, which is the adaptation for the first X-men movie, is horrible. It feels like the writers didn't have much space, so they crammed the movie into a handful of pages. It gives some of the action a jerky, incomplete feel that leaves you wondering what just happend. The dialogue in places is some of the corniest I have seen in a long time. Characters state the obvious very eloquently during tense moments. Finally, the artwork is so dark overall that I find myself wishing there was a magic light switch to make the pages brighter.The second half is worth the buy though. A few of the older comics are included after the first one, and they have class. They are intelligent, funny, suspenseful, and great for people who are just getting in to the x-men universe. They are what made me glad I purchased this book."
1,QUESTION,"WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHY THE BOOK ""X-MEN: THE MOVIE"", WHICH HAS 144 PAGES, COSTS FIFTEEN DOLLARS, WHILE THE OTHER BOOK, WHICH IS SIMPLY CALLED ""X-MEN"" AND HAS 233 PAGES, (SAME STORY AS ""X-MEN: THE MOVIE"")COSTS JUST SEVEN DOLLARS?"
4,"X-men, is Xcellent","I saw the movie and just had to read the book. I loved the animated series and comics when I was young. Hugh Jackman is a wonderful wolverine, better than I expected. In fact everyone was cast perfectly. Missed the Beast and Gambit, but hopefully they will be in the sequel. I hope the hard-core fans liked it as much as those who have never heard of the X-men. Surely no one can deny, it's Excellent."
4,whey,"It's a little more clumpy than the Gold Standard 100% whey and doesn't mix as well with milk or water. It also seems to have more of the ""protein"" aftertaste."
2,Not as good as other Optimum products,"I had tried a number of different protein powders before settling on the ON 100% Whey and love it. I had tried a few other MRPs and thought they were all OK - but none blew me away. I figured the ON MRP would be similar to the protein and I would love it - I was wrong! The taste of the Chocolate is not at all the same, by adding carbs/fat it changed it completely so rather than being easy to blend and tasting pretty good you definitely have to force this down and it took a lot of shaking in a water bottle to get it to blend. I would recommend EAS Myoplex or Universial Real Gains over this."
4,good capper,"..after I ordered this capper, I saw a flyer for a home brewing contest and the flyer had a picture of this capper on it so maybe it's the standard in home brewing? I like the capper...it's pretty heavy and sturdy. I broke a small piece off of it, but it was my fault. I'm always afraid the capper isn't perfectly level and my cap will be all crooked. I've bottled about 20 beers with it and it gets the job done without any problems."
3,mediocre quality and not fool-proof,"Item arrived with plastic guide on one side slightly dinged. If you press down too soon before squeezing inward the handle/levers will catch on these plastic guides and continue to wear them away. The design could be improved by making these guides curved so they guide the levers inward to the center from the start. Also, the bell at the top where the cap is seated has a good bit of tolerance, so it's easy to get caps off-center. It does what it's supposed to, but you must use it with care."
5,Great Capper,"Caps bottles. Doesn't break them. Not much else to it. I did have the magnet come off on me, just turn it so that it is tight, fixed it right up."
5,Works as designed.,Bottle capper works as designed and seems to be of a good quality. I've used it several times and it does a good job of seating the caps securely and tightly.
4,Works great for your standard bottles,Pros: It works great and is easy to use. It puts the caps on securely and I have had no issues with the seal.Cons: It does not work for all bottles. The standard long neck beer bottles is what it works best on. I was not able to get it to properly seal caps on bottles that had shorter thick necks. I think it was the thickness of the neck that prevented it.
4,works or not,"bottle capper it hits the center real hard give distinct empression on cork only thing dont care for be nice for capper tip mor blunt to not tear up corks so much,besides that works well 90 corks now still going strong"
1,Did not fit my Pathfinder!!,"I have a 1999 Nissan Pathfinder SE, Amazon's guide said they fit my car, well after receiving them I know this is not true!!! The rubber opening on each end are not made for this truck , I had to call KYB corporate and they gave me the right part # for my truck!! Now I have have to take time out of my day to send these back because of amazon's mistake..grrrrr"
1,cheap material,When the beret is held up u can see through it also u can actually tear apart the material.
3,my review,"I like berets, but this one had a sort of fluffy, almost angora-like texture. Prefer the short-hairs."
4,Gift for Mom,"I bought this beret for my mother because she stated that she was looking for a red beret, and found this item. I recently gave my mother this beret, and she was delightfully surprised and overjoyed. This beret looks beautiful when worn, and goes great with any outfit, especially a classy one."
3,Its not bad for a costume,"I bought it for a French theme party and it did the job. If you are looking for more, I would suggest paying more for a better quality hat but for a costume its spot on."
5,perfect birthday gift,it was what she wanted she is taking french in school and she feels more french when she wears it the power of influence
3,Not as good as the first two but decent,"This is probably my least favorite of the beefs. Most of it is about todays rappers go at it. You see T.I vs Lil flip, Game vs. 50 cent, and more. Most of the beefs though do get squashed well except for game and 50 we all know that still going on. It's pretty interesting but not like the first beef. Even the second one had some pretty good beefs. The one I don't get is why would they put lil scrappy vs the police. Man almost every rapper is against the police thats not a beef. Anyway a pretty good dvd but not worth to buy."
1,BEEF III -THE RAP GAME IS DEAD.,"Beef 1 is the best one of the 4,the only reason worth watching is Pac',all the rest is just post-1996(Rap Game is Dead)malarkey,Biggie,G a y -Z, flab boy,mobb sleep are all whack, East Coast Rap unless it's 80s or BDI and Bootcamp Clik/SmiffnWessum it doesn't matter, And all these so-called ""Positive Rappers"" as Willie D once said Positivity ain't getting nobody paid. All these back-packers read Fake muslims(Nation of Islam is a Radical Communist Sect-yet they have an monopoly on bean pies and providing security for the industry,ironically the suspect last seen around BIG was an Bowtie wearing ""Peaceful"" follower.) The only ones worth listening to Yukmouth,Scarface,Willie D,Dru Down,E-40,Bone,Spice 1,GrandMaster Flash,Big Daddy Kane,but all these others are all over rated,Krs-one is one self centered sucka MC.Backpackers or bling rap is still dead."
3,good,it is a good documentary but i think it should have 50 cent's side of the story on the beef with the game.
3,Cinematographic masterpiece,"Vol. 3 of this series focuses on things that happened in the last year or so. This is great because nobody remembers last year. I'm glad they didn't waste time showing anything interesting or featuring any rappers who matter. My favourite part is the feature on Twista vs. Bone Thugs n Harmony, which is Twista saying ""we never had beef"" and krayzie or whichever bone saying ""we never had beef"". Perfect material for a dvd titled Beef. I was particularly impressed by interviews with such stars as a guy who used to know 50 Cent, and a guy who kind of looks like Phife Dawg. I'm sure guys like KRS-One, Ice Cube and B-Real really wanted to come back, but they just weren't big enough names."
4,pretty good ball,"this is a great ball for its price. the extra wide channels make a big difference, and the overall grip is great. its a bit sticky when you first get it but i guess thats normal with new balls. it is overall a good ball, but if you're willing to spend more money for something better, get the Spalding NeverFlat Outdoor ball."
2,not as tacky as I want,"The surface gets slippery just after a few months of playing outdoor. No long exposure to sunlight as it was always kept in garage when it is not being used. I also consider ours as occasional plays, about twice a week, and I played with 2 young boys. Now it is over a year, and there is a lump in a spot."
3,Great CD,"I love this CD. I first copied it from a friend, but listened to it so much that I had to buy the CD myself. My favorite song on the CD is ""Le Dernier Soldat,"" a very moving song. Thank God for Amazon.com and their commitment to providing us with music from all over the world. I don't know where I would have found this CD if I couldn't get it here."
1,fragile: velcro could be stronger than the reflective material. Easy to damage on removal if you are not careful,"fragile: velcro could be stronger than the reflective material. Easy to damage on removal if you are not careful- so, be careful if you buy these"
2,They worked but too narrow and cheaply made,"They worked, for a while. They are narrow not really providing a broad surface for reflection. They are cheaply made. I had one had the stitching fall apart. Bought another brand > 'Reflective Band - Made With Genuine Reflexite in America - By Jogalite (Pair of Two)'. This Jogalite brand is much better. Wider, better materials, better stitching work."
5,"Beginings for some , and others , sing along .","Clearly this is a classic cd for all genres and for all ages.My friends ,and family love hearing the wonderful songs and melodies.Sometimes we listen as we do our chore, or , sometimes, we just kick up our feet, and just sittin' again ; and listen to good warm feeling music."
2,I wish I'd have checked these reviews first.,"I had the pleasure of seeing Loggins & Messina in their reunion concert and must say that it was one of the best I've ever been to. I saw this CD at the show and mistakenly understood that it was the two of them BACK in the studio RE-recording. I didn't realize it was just a compilation of some songs as they were originally recorded. Had I known, I wouldn't have bought it. I should have read the reviews first. Oh well."
4,The Best is REally THE BEST,"If you recall the original project was a Kenny Loggins solo album with Jim Messina just sitting in and then the first album went platinum and the rest is history. To me the early albums are the best. This compilation has all the hits including ""Crazy Eyes"" and more. If you haven't invested in the single CD's of their albums this one is for you, no need to buy a double CD. Sound is great (of course vinyl is always better), highly recommend."
4,Welcome Back,"Shamefully neglected music from the 70's. They seriously disappeared from the radar in the late 70's with the arrival of punk and disco, the 2 most damaging musical movements of all time. Hopefully other artists can enjoy some sort of critical and popular renaissance as well. Pray tell, who will be listening to the Sex Pistols in 50 years time."
3,A Sony Blunder,"Actually, I was in error with another Loggins & Messina CD review, but this is the one I found in the budget bin, with (18) Tracks. A nice selection of songs, but marketed so you have to buy others for, at least, their US Top 40 charted songs. The (re)mastering is shoddy, specially with ""Your Mama Don't Dance"". Sounds like it was possibly remixed on a old analog mixing board with worn components. Nothing severe, mind you, but if you want pristine sound quality, seek another CD or source. If Sony only put their Blu-Ray ""quality"" into all their products, and use genuine session tapes, without amateurs involved, they probably would receive better reviews."
2,If ua have any flash experiance...,"Ok so the name of the book is flash ""Quickstart"" but I did look at this book as an associate boutght a copy, but if u have ever touched flash before mainly version 3 then this book is useless, it never touches any of the new abilites of flash , keep it in mind when looking for a book - because nothing in here cant be figured out on your own or learned through an online resource for free"
1,This book is not good for me.,"Well I bought this book from amazon.com and I was expecting it to be the best book about flash ever after reading the reviews , but discovered it only have the basic's of flash 4 and the information is not giving in a clear way , I did not enjoy reading the book nor using it , and the book is sitting right up my shelf's doing nothing. So don't waste your money on this book it's not worth it."
4,"Ok, but too simple, other book is required","The information presented is reliable and ok, but it is too simple for what I was expecting. I wanted a more serious approach with at least a real-world full projects done,even the examples that come with Flash are cooler. The first 100 pages teach you how to use a Windows interface. with Flash, something that you already know. This is more like a superficial introduction to the product. I gave it a 4 due even is so basic, the basic is covered in a clear manner. Need a more advanced book for Flash"
5,Good stuff,"Being a newbie at Flash 4, I needed a book which would go thru the basics, but at the same time not leave me with a ""Is that all?"" thought at the end. I have to admit that these VQS guides didn't impress me initially, why? Maybe because the title implies ""quick and simple"". However, I've grown to really enjoy the series. Like others in its series, this book is very affordable, illustrative, and packed with more than enough information to get you started, but not treat you like a fool...I've got 2 chapters to go, and I can say that I've learnt a lot from this book. With many simple, but very useful examples, complemented with explainations and pictures, there's nothing else to complain about.All I can say is that this book is a great buy. If you've just got Flash 4, then this is a must!PS. The Photoshop 5.5 and 3D Studio Max 3 VQS guides are also very good!"
4,No better way to QuickStart!,I decided to buy this book after fumbleing around on my own and not getting anywhere fast. Within hours of basically just paging through the book i was able to start putting an animation together. This truly is a quick starting quide that will get you going in no time at all. But starting is where it stops. If you are looking to do something more complex you will find the book lacking in help. Things such as Action Scripting are kind of just skimmed over and leave you confused about what to do to make things work properly. So if your a Beginner and want to get started quickly this is your book.
4,"Just reveived the book today, I really like it.",I like the pictures that go with the directions. It makes working with the program much easier. This book is probably not for someone who is Flash Master.
2,Not such a quick start,"I didn't like the book at all. I tend to figure the programs out on my own and need a book for reference to learn a certain task. this isn't that kind of book. Definitions are vague and it was difficult to find certain tasks, and the meaning of some of the actions. I really wouldn't recommend this book."
2,what a jip,"this book is week. the author assumes that everyone is a complete moron. it is a rehash of the manual that came with the program. there are no interesting tid-bits of information AT ALL. if you are looking for action scripts or advanced effects DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. however, if you are interested in rereading the basics or just having an incredibly boring night at home with your computer check it out. in all honesty it's a book for newbies."
3,Good,"This book is a good beginner's entrance to Flash. But, the book seems like you have no experience in computers. In some of the examples, it will spend a whole different page on explaining something that is really obvious. This is why the book is so thick. The book is definitely worth buying if you want to learn the basics of flash, in a sort of illiterate way."
2,Too basic even for rookies,"This book is so basic, that you will learn how to use a menu and click buttons on a Windows iterface"
4,Great Quick Start Guide,"This book is just another of the great quickstart series. It is designed for those of use who haven't used flash before, and I love it. Basic, easy to understand...."
1,very bad book (short text),"everything u see in this book is a way too easy. if pple can't even those things, don't even bother to learn flash"
3,Good as far as it goes,"It covers the basics very well, but I'm not sure I learned very much that I didn't pick up from the online tutorial. I wanted to learn more about scripting and actions - it just isn't there beyond the barest outline.If you have already used other graphics/multimedia software then you will be irritated by the long descriptions of how to draw a straight line, how to cut, copy and paste, etc.At least its not an expensive book. I did get one or two tips, but I could probably have learned the same things from the various websites offering support."
1,"Plodding, No Quick Start Here","Elizabeth Castro's HTML books were a real Visual Quick Start, this one just plods along so very, very slowly. It reads ""as if"" the author was rummy from far too many sleepless nights getting it to press. Don't judge a book by its series.I wonder who this book was written for when so many of the lessons start with: ""Open a new Flash document, and add two new layers. This gives you a total of three layers in the movie."" Can you say THREE, boys and girls? It points out obvious stuff like this over and over again, but then is scant to mum regarding not so obvious details, like ""Flash Actions"". I regret having highlighted one line in the book, if I hadn't I'd be able to return it."
4,A great start but not quick,"This book saves itself from a poor rating only by explaining everything so clearly. I am the type of learner who needs to see examples, not explanations. I did not fare well with this book beacuse of that. It does an increadible job of showing you how everything in Flash works, and in steps that could not possibly be clearer. What frustrated me was the lack of real world examples and the amount of time it takes to get through the explanations of everything. If this is frustrating you try the Essential Flash 4 book. It makes up for where this book lacks. This book is a great resource for Flash 4 though. I would recommend it as a companion."
2,More hash than flash,"Having played around with an evaluation version of this program for a couple of weeks, with varying degrees of success, I decided to make my life easier and buy a tutorial. Unfortunately, I selected this book. It wasn't until I reached chapter 10 that I learned something I had not already worked out for myself. If you are a complete newcomer to Flash, do yourself a favour, download the manual from the Macromedia site and save your money for a more advanced tutorial if and when you need it."
2,Don't bother,"I bought this shredder for my office. Just under 1 year it started getting temperamental in that it would stop shredding. I called Fellowes and they instructed me on how to clean the paper sensors and said that they will periodicly get blocked with paper dust. Well unfortunately, the situation has not improved unless I clean them after each use. I had much better luck with my previous shredder that was considerably less expensive and was manufactured by a company that does not specialize in shredders. Save your money and buy a less expensive one that will last longer."
1,Warranty NO good,"Be advised, the warranty is no good. Fellowes will not honor their warranty. I tried twice already. It doesn't matter what story you have. They find some excuse to get out of it. Don't bother paying to ship the heavy thing back, they will just deny your claim and try to charge you to send something that doesn't work back to you."
1,A lip gloss that tinggles,"Wont buy it again. Nothing special about it, tinggles for a little while. No plumping. Nothing that any other lip gloss can't do."
3,butterfly,didn't do much...it didn't PLUMP my lips a lot but it smelled great and i really liked it actually .i think i might order one more
1,Just lip service!,"In the words of our local consumer advocate....""Don't waste your money!"" If you walk around with your mouth stuck out like the product picture...maybe! The only thing this product plumps up is...the comapny's bottom line....nuff said!"
1,"Outdated, sparse, poor","I'm quite amazed by the positive reviews, because this is one of the worst web related books I've ever seen. The techniques presented in this book are often outdated and I could not believe my eyes when I saw the book has been published in 2002. Tricks like using the <pre> tag to increase leading apparently did not die in the 90's.Even worse, it's plagued with errors --- I found about six huge errors (not typos!) on four pages.Hands off this one."
2,"Came up ""short""","This cable was billed not just as a replacement for the Canon STV 250N but the actual cable so I thought I would be getting the identical cord that came with my camera. The one I received is 1/5 to 1/3 shorter. I don't know what market they are trying to appease by that measure. Also, the mini plug is at a right angle to the cable instead of straight. It's not a favorable feature if you know the socket hub of the Canon cameras. I don't know where to go to get the exact copy of the original Canon composite A/V cable, but this ain't it."
1,Does not work!!!,"I purchased this cord thinking it would be the exact replacement, it wasn't. Looks simular but would not work on my unit. My dad has the same type camera, so I asked to use his and it worked fine, so I asked the company to replace the defective cable.They responded and sent me another cable without me sending back the defective one, and it does not work either.So I have two cables to sell or give away to someone and now I still have to find and purchase the correct cable so I can return my dads.I would not recommend this cable to anyone, find and buy the better quality cable."
1,Not Compatible,"This cable appears to be a decent quality for the price. The only problem is that it is not a Canon STV-250N cable, as listed, and is NOT COMPATIBLE with applications that require a STV-250N cable. It cannot be made to work because the ground on a REAL Canon STV-250N cable is on the RING NEXT TO the base of the 3.5mm connector, whereas, on this cable the ground is on the base of the 3.5mm connector. It simply is not the same cable."
1,it doesn't work,"the cable was connected to the camera (a canon video) and the tv (a 42"" panasonic hd plasma tv).The images didn't appear on the screen."
4,Canon video out chord,I use these chords for sending video from cameras into Canon ZR camcorders. This allows the camcorder to act as a VCR from an external source for recording astronomical events. I have used these in French Polynesia for solar eclipse recording and in the US for asteroid occultation recording. They perform perfectly!
5,The Return to New,"Absolutely stunning! Who would've imagined the blues city could produce such an international funkafied groove? Rolling drumbeats and intricate brass work combined with downhome, Ivory Coast strings makes for an afrobeat sound that Fela Kuti would be impressed by. With little to no hype or advertising, this is definately a sleeping giant of an album. Highly recommended for any funk aficianado."
2,Can't see the tree for the forest,"This book is a compilation (in order) of short (a few pages each) biographies of the lineage and throne holders and other lamas of the Palyul Lineage of the Nyingma tradition. The biographies include much legendary material (especially in the older ones) and consist mostly of the many empowerments and types of teachings each person received and gave. If you are interested in an intricate history of a continual lineage, this book's for you. Unfortunately, there are virtually no teachings in the body of the work. It does include a 20 page notes section which does include some valuable information of some interest (otherwise, I'd have given it 1 star)."
1,blade review,The blades received does not contain the mounting hole as depicted in the picture for the item. My jig saw requires that hole for proper mounting.
2,Wouldn't buy them...,"Too many odd-ball knives, made ultra cheaply. When they break, watch out! I'd save my money and get a couple/few good knives that will last. These rust badly, but what do you expect for so little money??"
5,Soothing and makes for easy listening,The music is familiar and is great when you put in on for home dinners with friends or at the end of a stressful workday.
3,old edition,"It helped with some basic computer questions I had. The problem I had was I didn,t realize it was a 2006 edition and was not compatible with windows 7 which is what I have. Still worth the $4.99 I paid for shipping and handling. Interesting that it was shipped from Great Britain."
5,A gift to a songwriter.,This was a gift and since the recipient was very pleased with the quality of the product I was pleased as well.
1,hated it,"This vacuum actually worked well (when it was working). My biggest compliant is that something in it, maybe a belt, kept breaking. I could tell it was broken because when I would vacuum it would smell like burning rubber. The smell lasted forver! I had to get it repaired for this same thing 3 times. I've had it for a little over 2 years now and recently the spinning brush gave out on me. I don't vacuum too often and a lot of the times it was in for repair so it should have lasted much longer. Anyway, take my advice, go with a different vacuum. If you still insist on buying this one, make sure you buy the warranty!"
4,I like it a lot so far...,"I just got this two nights ago after my old Kenmore's power cord was chewed by my dog and not worth the trouble of fixing. Now I feel like all that time I had been vacuuming it was just a waste of my time! I pulled out so much dirt and fur out of my carpet, it was really gross, but made me happy to have purchased this vacuum. I also had to shake out the filter three times when I vacuumed today. Once on each floor level, but it picked up so much stuff I'll do it gladly! Better in the garbage than on my floor. It is scarily loud though. Very noisey, but still worth it. The cleaning tool on the front is super cool, especially if you have any animals. Picks up fur from hardwood floors and steps really well. I love it so far!"
2,"Works great at first, then turns into a nightmare!","I bought this vac a year ago and it worked great at first, picking up all the stuff you see on those vaccum commercials (big paper clips, staples etc.). About two months ago this thing went way downhill in terms of performance. It would pick things up but they wouldn't go into the canister, everything just got stuck in the hose. I would then have to shake the hose out on to the floor, somewhat defeating the purpose of vaccuming, and pick up the big clumps of dirt that had formed in the hose with my hands. Today when I started vaccuming it spit out pieces of dirt from the last time I vacced on to the floor which I then had to vac up again. Think it's time I put this thing, and myself, out of misery."
1,WASTE OF $$$$$$,"This is my first Dirt Devil vacuum and thought for the $60 bucks it was a good temporary vacuum for the upstairs of my home. Little did I know..1.) The thing would NOT vacuum up anything on the carpet2.) It would blow the dirt OUT and about and all over3.) It made everything MORE dirty4.) It was SO loud it scared my two cats to death...they only have 8 lives left!Horrible contraption and even worse customer service. Called to check on just why it was blowing air out at me and why it would not vacuum as a vacuum is suppose to...was told that Dirt Devil does not replace, exchange, or refund for a bad machine. Also, that vacuums are suppose to blow hot air and dust out the front.Don't buy...go with Bissell. They actually make a vacuum!!!"
1,BUY SOMETHING ELSE,"I bought this vacuum a year ago and now I wish I didn't. The first thing to break after a year was the Turbo tool. Then a month later the belt on the main vacuum for the floor brush broke. After replacing the belt, it still did not vacuum right and was twice as loud. The replaced belt broke and it was replaced. Then the brush attachment melted in several places. This manufactorer says there is a 3 year warrenty on parts, I am waiting to see if they will honor that or not. I will not buy replacement parts that may or may not work for any length of time. I'll sooner throw the entire vacuum in the trash and buy another brand."
2,Respiratory problems ? BEWARE!,"Has great suction (will eat heavy scatter rugs!)and turbo tool is great for upholstery. In spite of ""self propelled"" feature, still somewhat clumsy. HEPA filter located inside collection bin is a nightmare!! Regular maintenance says must be cleaned after every use by removing, tapping inside garbage can. Dirt, dust, pet hair...everything so marvelously sucked into collection bin, now goes flying back out of filter into air, on floor, all over inside and outside of garbage bag, and up your nose! And the hepa filter (which cannot be brushed) is STILL full of dirt. I used the hose to suck dirt, dust and hair from filter into collection bin, but this whole process rather defeats the purpose. I have asthma and had very bad reaction. Better to use w/o filter."
1,Sorry I wasted my money on this piece of junk,"Please do not waste your money on this vacuum! I replaced an old Hoover upright (1986) with this dirt devil and regret it everytime I have to vacuum. It did work fine the first few months and now it just spits the dirt right back out onto the floor, barely any suction. We have no indoor pets or small children messes to deal with either. We have replaced belts, filters, rollerbrush and it still won't function properly. The cord is too long, the hose and attachments do not stay connected. Thank goodness I have mainly hardwoord floors and can sweep because this vacuum is headed for the dump. The manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves for evening putting this on the market. I will definitely go back to Hoover and soon. My 1986 model actually still worked fine, so old that it had no headlight or on board tools, that's why I bought a new one. Lesson learned. If you insist on buying a Dirt Devil Vision Turbo, email me and I'll GIVE you mine!!!!"
1,Worst vacuum ever,"I bought this vacuum a little over a year ago, and at first absolutely loved it. It was loud, but it seemed to do a great job of cleaning the carpets. I was so excited. Within a couple of weeks, something broke on it. I went back to the store and they replaced it. In the last year, I have had to replace this vacuum four times. I finally gave up and am buying a Dyson. I definately do not recommend this vacuum to anyone, unless you enjoy getting a new one every couple of months."
2,Will never buy another Dirt Devil,"I've learned my lesson, this is my 3rd Dirt Devil and I will never buy another. The only thing I like about this vacuum is the turbo attachment. Otherwise, it is heavy to push, loud, and the hose continuously comes out during vacuuming. I even had to remove the ""kick stand"" from underneath because it kept popping up keeping me from pushing the vacuum. And as with all upright Dirt Devils, the cord comes out from the bottom causing it to be run over and eventually chewed up. If they would just have it come out from the top of the vacuum so that you didn't have to worry about holding on to it, it wouldn't be a problem. This will be my last Dirt Devil."
2,"Works great at first, now it's garbage after one year.","We bought this a year ago, and I was happy with it at first. It picked up dirt well, and also worked on a multitude of surfaces (carpet, linoleum, area rugs). There was no way to turn off the brush for bare floors, so it had a tendency to shoot the dirt out of the back when you used it.The next thing we noticed was the HEPA filter needed to be replaced much sooner than expected, and those things are pricey. It was also a messy chore to empty the dirt container, forget doing that in the house! It took a trip outside to bang the filter on the sidewalk to get all the dirt out.Finally, after one year of regular use, our Dirt Devil was done. It started tripping the circuit breaker every time we used it. We had it looked at, but now it's in the trash. I won't be buying another Dirt Devil."
1,It doesn't suck; it blows,"I bought this vacuum less than a year ago, and use it weekly or bi-weekly on a small two-bedroom apartment with cats. It was very loud, so much that it scares the dickens out of the cats, but it worked well until three months ago.That's when its suction was working less and less. I kept thinking, ""Wow, I have to vacuum more often, maybe the cats are shedding,"" or ""I can't believe how dirty we've been lately."" As it turns out, the vacuum wasn't really picking up items so much as it was either redistributing them around the carpet, or collecting them in the nozzle. As soon as I'd turn it off to store it, things came out all over the place.I'm frustrated to have to buy yet another vacuum in less than a year's time. No more Dirt Devils for me."
2,"After listening to ""Upon my wicked son"" this is disapointing","As an avid Wall of Voodoo (WOV) fan I had high hopes with regards to Andy Prieboy's work. I ordered both of his albums (Upon my wicked son & Sins of of our fathers). I listened to ""Upon my wicked son"" first. WOW ! What a great album !I realy enjoyed it to the point that several of the album's songs were on automatic playback in my head for a couple of days. This albums deserves a 10 stars rating. After such a high, Sins of our fathers was a near total let down . The lyrics are OK but its the music that dosen't seem to fit and lacks that ""wall of voodoesque"" rythm and cutting edge. I was disapointed 'cause I know Andy has done a lot better elsewhere. Come to think of it its like comparing the great WOV Seven days in Sammy's town album with the mediocre Happy planet one. Prieboy seem to function on a feast or famine model..."
3,Potato Pancakes,This is a good story for kids just learning what Hannukah is and what kind of traditions they have. it is rather funny though to see thata little bit of almost anything can go into a potato pancake.
4,Great re-thinks of classic spy music.,"A great CD - especially if you enjoy different ""takes"" on music genres - in this case, spy music. You can't go wrong with an album that features (among others) MAN OR ASTROMAN? and COMBUSTIBLE EDISON."
2,Not what I expected at all,"Maybe I missed something, but I thought there would be speaking from the Dalai Lama on this CD. Nope. It is entirely musical."
5,nice easy read for kids,I read this one to my 7 year old son and it held his interest from start to finish.I wish there were more books like this around.
1,Worst Reception Ever,"I would have given this radio zero stars except that was not a choice. I, like the other reviewer, thinks this is the worst radio you could possibly buy. Every feature on the radio works great except the radio itself, which by the way is the main feature I bought it for. I even called Sony customer service, but all they said was to return it if dissatified. If there was at least an option to add an external antenna, that might help, but there is not, and no way to even hook one up if you had one. Please don't waste your money!!!"
3,Pot Pies for Adult Taste,"Though I found this cookbook interesting, there were many contradictions and areas where it lacked. Mrs. Ojakangas talks about pot pies being international yet the majority of her recipes had a French flair to them. Personally, these are recipes I'd expect in Bon Appetit, they are not your everyday family fare. Many recipes require a large number of ingredients. Many you will be hard pressed to find in your local store.I did find it a bit difficult to prepare many of her recipes after coming home from work. Though it can be done, it does mean eating late in some cases. If you're short on time, wait to try most of these recipes on the weekend.Though I can't see myself picking up this cookbook often, these are recipes that are great for casual company, brunches, and garden parties. If you like European home-style cuisine, you'll enjoy this cookbook. If you are looking for simple meat and potato recipes, move on."
2,Not really a book...,"Though the recipes in here are fine, this isn't the cookbook I was looking for. It is one of those small little books that sell on the bargain table at Barnes & Noble, not in the cookbook section.If I had expected a small cheap booklet, I'd probably be happy. The recipes are well written and sound good. However, I was expecting a cookBOOK."
5,Everyone should have this book . . .,"And everyone should taste the dill, havarti, shrimp and roasted pepper pot pie. I've given this book and a pie as a gift more times than I can remember. People ask me to make recipes from this book. Yum, yum yummy!"
5,Steamy angst romance,"This is pretty cute steamy book filled with angst and snappish attitude between the two main characters. A definite page turner for me and I actually stayed up reading this one (which is rare for me when it comes to Harlequin books)This features Samantha Brewster, a wild modern minded woman, who was set up for a blind date with Demetrios Karas in one of Samantha's sisters' party, but never did meet each other properly, leaving a whole set of problems throughout the book. Samantha was a translater and ironic part is Demetrios was in need of a skilled translater for a business transaction. From where Samantha saw it, Demetrios was trying to own her entire life. Gotta love the sexual tension they had for each other plus so much ego and pride in all the wrong places in this book."
1,The kindle version of this is the worst one I've ever read!,"The story is fine. But I lost my appetite by hundreds of wrong spacing and tons of misspellings.Moreover, some of these ""$*a-?@#9*"" sentences appeared between the lines,which made me uncertain about whether I had missed anything in the story!"
1,"nice idea, but don't buy it",this toy was great fun in the pool for about 20 min---then it broke. don't waste your money. water gets into the battery compartment and toy dies.
5,Funny and Clever....,I think the reader from MN missed the entire point of the book -staying fabulous is to make YOURSELF happy thereby helping to build a solid foundation to build a relationship upon...not all about simply making your husband happy. I found the book to be light and humourous - it is not supposed to be a depressing discourse on what marriage is really like ...for some. Why is it we can't believe that happiness is an option thses days? If you want to find out more about bitter and depressing reltionships I would suggest Jerry Springer and Rikki Lake (sp?)and for addressing serious problems - the self-help section or a counselor! Lighten up!
5,Great beans,Great beans. I roast them to an espresso roast and they have a very nice flavor and aroma
5,On my second bag,Took a flyer on the Guat Huehueteango. Glad I did. Roast to a very nice cup all the way from City to Vienna. I'm on my second bag and if I can find a way to keep em flowing I likely will.
5,"Excellent All-Purpose Yoga Practice By My Favorite Yoga Instructor, Rodney Yee!","This is a great way to learn yoga. You can benefit from it as a brand new beginner, starting slowly, and then improving as you continue to practice. You simply do what you can do, not struggling to meet someone else's idea of perfection. I love Rodney Yee's low-key approach. My husband once walked in as I was practicing and said, ""You are doing exactly what he's doing!"" That was the best compliment anyone could give me about my yoga practice. I'm at, and probably will remain at, the Intermediate level. That's where I am. As I get older and have had injuries from an automobile accident, I find that my form isn't 'perfect' but I do what I can do and I'm comfortable with that. Rodney Yee doesn't seem to push me to do what is not appropriate for me. I like that.I recommend this yoga practice highly!"
3,Not round,"I play with it, but its not perfectly round. It has a nice material that will last on outdoor play, but you can feel the unevenness of the ball. During pickup, no one wants to play with it. So I use it for practice before games. There has to be better."
3,Aceptable,"Me parece un producto bastante aceptable, la calidad es buena aunque pudo ser mejor, no obstante y basados en el precio del mismo la calidad es buena. Luego de mas de un año de uso el balon aun se encuentra en buenas condiciones.Recomendable."
3,Cheap rubber basketball,"For a cheap rubber basketball it's usable. Like most inferior quality balls it's slightly out-of-round and I question the weight as well. It was advertised as ""Authentic Size"" which I'm sure it is but it seems light. When you get used to a lighter ball it's tough to go to a authentic weight ball (during a pick-up game when another ball is used, for example)."
3,A little defection,The basketball I bought is not completely orbicular (you can try to turn the ball to check it out). Thus it is not good to inflate the ball with 80% above.
5,Perfect,This was a Christmas gift from my kids and it replaced my 20 year old basketball that I had. It's is great for indoor and outdoor play
2,No one is a serious player here,"I am sorry, but I trusted over 100 reviews that said this was was good, and I finally decided to get it.The price was definitely attractive, but as always, you get what you pay for.If you have ever played with Indoor balls like TF-1000, or quality outdoor balls Zi/O Excel Basketball then you will hate this ball.The one I got was nicely inflated, but is not fully round, so the bounce is unpredictable, and the rubber consturction doesn't look that quality.I am keeping mine just because I bought it at a good price ($10.00), and I'll use it as a second ball, but hope this will save some of you the time and money that you don't want to spend."
3,It's an NBA street ball,Same as the ones you've probably seen in cities across the world. I personally thinks it bounces a little too high and is a little big and would recommend a NeverFlat instead if you can afford it. If you just want a cheaper ball to run with you this is still pretty good.
5,Medicine ball,I would not recommend these for filling with sand and using them for slams.Burst quickly after having professional baseball players slamming them into cement.Having them slam these balls with sand in them onto a cushioned surface like a couch cushion I would imagine it would not damage the ball.
4,basketball,looks kinda small. im giving it as a gift so will see what my hubby says about the size. cuz he said he wanted the official size. so will have to se.
1,Very Disappointed,"Awful Customer Service !!! Cheap quality!I Bought Two of these balls.Got to say that info on the description is a sheer lie.Concerning shipping weight which states it is 1.8 pounds. In reality it turns out to be 12 pounds (it was important to me as use interim shipping company). I tried to contact the seller but they did not pay attention. Absolutely awful customer service.The ball itself seems to be made of cheap materials in China and is of cheap quality. The worst ball I ever had, does not even seem to last long time, especially if you play outdoors. The grip does not feel well and what is most important one of two balls needs pumping every other day.I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE YOU FROM BUYING THIS PRODUCT !!!!"
1,The material is bad,"It is made badly, not good for either practice or play ball. Although it's very cheap. I strongly recommend you not to buy it!"
5,Great Street Ball,"I bought this and the UK rubber basketballs for a YMCA pool, this ball is a bit hard for a pool area but it sure would have been nice 40 years ago when I played outside in alleys on coal ashes & rock but it is good for an indoor pool if young kids are not in the area.This is a well constructed, tuff ball for outdoors where leather is not practical.Trot on to the Buggy Bowl!HH"
1,No lo quiero,Ya no quiero este articulo esta pelta es muy mala esta en mala condiciones por favor asepteme la de volucion
3,not to bad,"ya my son says the ball is not bad, I cant really say cause I dont use it. sorry i am no help, but like always price was good and also the shipping was great"
1,Cheap playground ball,"I have three problems with this outdoor ball:1. The ball is clearly designed for durability but the result is a ball that's too hard. Unlike many indoor/outdoor balls this one has absolutely no cushion. It's made out of hard rubber that might last forever but is no fun to play with.2. The ball is too rough. Many reviews cite the ""excellent"" grip that this ball provides. Although true, the grip is so rough that it's not an exageration to say that it will seperate your finger nails from the tips of your fingers if you don't catch a pass in just the right way.3. This rubber ball has way too much bounce to it. It's reminiscent of those Voit bouncy balls used in school yard playgrounds, just 5 times harder.In short, spend a few extra dollars for an indoor/outdoor ball. The grip might not last as long but the overall quality of your balling experience will be much improved."
1,Two balls and they both leak.,"AMZ was great in replacing the first ball we have that leaked air every day. However, the 2nd ball leaked air rapidly as well. In less than a week, my son has to have the ball pumped five times. We tried everything, pumped it up a bit more thinking the increased air pressure would close the valve a bit more, storing it in the kitchen where it's warmer reading how cold air affects the pressure e.g. No dice. It must be a bad batch of faulty valves but we're going for a more expensive and hopefully better ball this time."
4,Name of the Game,"This is a great basketball at a great price. Of course, Spalding is the official sponsor of the NBA, so the size, material, and performance is exactly what the doctor recommended! The reason for the loss of one star, is that there is a white barcode label on the basketball itself, which is not aesthetically pleasing. It cheapens the ball quite a bit. If it was not for that minor imperfection, this would be a 5 star ball!Also, one cannot beat Amazon's price - cheap, no tax, no ship, and it comes perfectly inflated! :)"
4,Basketball,"Honestly, what's to say? It's a basketball. It hold air. It bounces. It works. Get it if you want. I'm not a basketball ""fan,"" I just shoot some hoops every now and then. Recommended."
3,Lasted one summer,"Bought this last Christmas, it made it through the summer, but by this point is no longer has any grip. So I got the kids another one this Christmas. At this price ($8.99) I believe we got our value out of it but feel it should have stood up to a little more abuse than it did."
4,Good feel,I bought the intermediate ball for a third grader. He loves it. It has a good rubber cover that feels closer to a synthetic cover than rubber.
2,"Too slippery, bouncy and hard.",This is really a ground ball made of hard rubber. There is no cushion and bounces to the moon and back. My biggest issue is how slippery it is. Overall not a great ball but it looks good. Maybe let the kids have this one.
4,Spalding 6249 Official Size NBA Street Basketball,"Good day,The product was received as required. Thank you for your excellent management, received a cordial greeting from me."
5,great ball,"I purchase this basketball for outside use and so far its been great. Its rubber but not the cheap basketball rubber, its like leather ball but with more roughness. Its a bit on the bouncy side but I can deal with it.Overall great ball for outside use."
4,Good ball,"I've been using this ball on an outdoor court, and it is great. It came flat, so make sure you have a pump and needle to fill it!"
4,The search for the perfect street ball goes on...,"It's an excellent value and probably the best outdoor (rubber) ball I've had - it has a great grip, shape, & weight. BUT... it still too bouncy a feel compared with a good indoor or indoor/outdoor ball. I have to slightly under inflate it to compensate. You'd think someone would have figured this out by now."
4,Good value ball,I bought three of these balls for my kids to use with the new basketball hoop. Solid ball for driveway use. Can't beat the price.
4,"Solid ball, feels like it's a little flat but bounces fine","The ball feels a little flat if you push it in so you may want to overpump it. But first let it bounce and it's deceivingly bouncy. Other than that, the ball feels fine, I would recommend for a durable outdoor ball. The grip is great."
4,Good Value,"I usually go through outdoor balls in weeks. This ball has withstood the beating for months now and especially in the winter time when the material of other balls tend to wear and tear this one lasts. It also doesn't cause blisters and cuts on your fingertips like most other balls. I loved it so much I ordered another one. You can't argue with the price!The only negative is the break in period, the ball is extremely slick and when wet almost impossible to handle. But after a couple games it was fine."
5,A Six Year Old's First Spalding NBA Street Basketball,"This item was purchased as a gift for a six year old boy, who absolutely treasures it! He had just started playing on a team with boys his age, training on a court with a children's basketball coach and all he had was an inexpensive ball that wasn't even the correct size for him! He is now so thrilled with his new ball that he just can't play with it enough! Great product!"
4,One of the toughest bballs I've used,"The hide on this ball is much tougher/resilient than a regular indoor basketball. It was definitely made to withstand the street. I play on a driveway with a brushed cement finish that absolutely destroys balls and shoes. These balls hold up well despite the finish on my driveway.It seems like the hide is a little thicker too, which makes the channels a little deeper. This makes it a little easier to handle/palm the ball. I can just barely do it on a regular bball, and on this one it is much easier. It's fun when you play with it, but it may give you false confidence when you switch back to a regular ball.If you are a serious competitor, I wouldn't use this ball because it might change your game. You might start shooting/gripping differently because of the increased grip this ball provides."
1,Goes flat every day,"Ball worked fine for the first week or so. Now, it goes flat every day. If you pump it up, it still works fine, but will be flat again by the time you try to use it the next day. I guess you get what you pay for, and $12 for a quality full size basketball was just too good to be true."
4,a plain ball,"The feeling is plain and a little tough, like a plastic ball. But the price is cheap. I think this basketball is not a professional one. If you just play for fun, it's a good choice."
5,Best Buy,"there's not much to say about this basket ball. Its great, ive had it for almost over a year and its still in good condition. worth the price good brand not cheap like those bad copies of wanna-be basket balls. dont regret this purchases came right in time and in good condition."
2,"Love the feel, just bad","i love this ball for shooting, the grip feels wonderful and it flows well with your shot but everytime you want to use it you have to pump it up. it's absurd and frustrating"
4,"Solid grip, almost a little too much!","The overall quality of the ball is really good. When I first held the ball, I really liked how much grip there was to it. But after playing a game with it, it actually started to hurt my hands (and I don't have very soft hands either!). We swapped to another ball and immediately missed the grip, but didn't shred our hands. I assume after some serious wear it will get better, but in the mean time it stinks not to get the best of both worlds!"
4,Spalding Basketball,"Arrived slightly under-inflated but other than that its round and bounces on the ground. Ideally i would have preferred to have gotten the slightly smaller Basketball, as my son is not quite comfortable with the full size and weight. However, the smaller size was considerably more expensive....Hmmm, go figure. My son is none the wiser to my ordering dilemma and just loves the fact that he now has a basketball."
2,Grippy & Bouncy But is constantly going flat!,"Although it has good grp and has held up quite well, This ball does not stay inflated and i am having to carry a pump with me wherever i ball, dissapointing!"
5,GOOD GRIP!!!,My boys shoot ball in the cul-de-sac in front of my house and told me a month before Christmas that they needed a street ball. Of course I went to Amazon immediately and found the best deal ever!! My boys said the ball has a great frip and I have to agree! They love it!!
4,Ok for the casual hoopster,"I only have access to outdoor courts. I've used it religiously every saturday, sunday and holidays to shoot hoops. Nothing competitive, just shooting the ball. 10 months later and my ball is still good enough for me to exericse with. It is faded all around but it does maintain its basketball shape. I keep the ball in the trunk of my car. I really only worry about air every month after 4 months had gone by. It's not the ball you would want in a pickup game; it bounces too much. I am satisfied with my purchase and would buy another one when this one becomes unrecognizable."
2,Not so good,"I expected more from spalding. It must be a bad batch of faulty valves but we're going for a more expensive and hopefully better ball this time. They were great in replacing the first ball we have that leaked air every day. However, the 2nd ball leaked air rapidly as well. In less than a week, my son has to have the ball pumped five times. We tried everything, pumped it up a bit more thinking the increased air pressure would close the valve a bit more, storing it in the kitchen where it's warmer reading how cold air affects the pressure e.g. No dice."
4,Spalding Street,"I purchased this item for my husband's birthday. He is a moderate player in his late 20's and it fit him well. His hands are a bit rougher than most, so the texture didn't bother him. The size of the ball was perfect for his handling. He plays outdoor basketball at least 2-3 times a week and he enjoys it. We did notice that the ball goes flat after a while, so I just bought an air pump to keep it sufficient for use. Overall, the ball is of good quality and I would reccomend this product to anyone who loves to play ball, but I would also reccomend getting an air pump for long term use."
3,Fun while it lasted,"I purchased this ball last year thinking that it was a steal for my outdoor basketball play. Upon arriving I was thrilled about the ball. It did feel more rubbery than usual for me but I quickly got used to it and fell in love with the ball. This was short lived though because after my 24 game driveway season (games up to 60 points) was over the grip was nearly all gone and all the pimple like hills were smoothed over. On top of that, the ball didn't last the entire season and started losing air. Before every game I would need to give it a good pump or it wouldn't bounce. Overall for $15 this basketball would be a good buy, but don't expect too much from it, similar to what I did."
1,Playground Ball,This ball is more geared towards beginners or playground kids. The ball feels cheap and would recommend going w/composite leather.Definitely don't bring this ball to a pick-up game.
1,Unusable,Basketball does not hold air and is not perfectly round. Not expensive enough to bother returning. I have owned many basketballs and have never had this happen before.
1,Does not hold up to street play as advertised,"This item looked good and played good for the first couple of weeks. However, after minimal play time the ball no longer holds air and has worn significantly. Would not recommend this item."
5,Space Metal Classic,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned that this record seems to form a literal sonic bridge between the Krautrock/British Psych Underground of the late '60s and the Hard Rock/Proto-Heavy Metal of the '70s. You can actually hear the transition between the two eras as the disc plays.This sounds nothing like the subsequent recordings by this band and will probably not appeal to fans of their later, more famous work. However, fans of Hawkwind, Blue Cheer, Ash Ra Tempel, Black Sabbath and the Stooges need to give it a spin.If you like this, also check out the first record by the Scorpions 'Lonesome Crow' for a similarly uncharacteristic record by a famous band."
5,space rock extrodinaire,Myself am an UFO fan from way back when-for the era this was released this defined progressive space rock as it should be-it is easy to become highly involved within the confines of this recording-it has a quasi-chameleon effect as it goes along-quite original and expansive.The mainstream albums etched in stone are of course-Phenomenon-No Heavy Petting-Lights Out-and Force It;;ok so people it aint got that Schenkar sound then again what does-saw them in Atlanta more than once-personally i would have loved more UFO albums along this format in the later years but it is not exactly a comercial product-it is well worth a listen-a downside if any the bass can be a bit overpowering at moments otherwise a wild ecclectic ride to a cosmic dimension..
2,"Superficial, not soulful space rock..","This is one of the most boring albums ever produced. I don't care what fans say. There is no excitement. No development or change. It is just the same progressions repeated and repeated- all drearily plodding along in a haze of smoke. and, some of the most rediculous lyrics ever. ""Lost my self in a starry storm/had to find my way out"" always gets me to chuckle. This is an prime example of a competent bar-band having too much drugs."
3,Don't expect typical UFO with this one.,"If you love the hard rock sound of UFO do not expect to find it on this release. This album was very experimental and features many long freaky guitar solos, (The fact there are only five tracks on this disc should alert you to this.) I honestly don't think I would pay full price for it, but if you can find it used somewhere for like $5 it's worth it. Put it on if you want to mellow out by yourself. The guitar solos will lull you into another state of mind Man. :) I can't speak as to the quality of the remastering because I haven't heard it. I am reviewing this album from listening to my old vinyl copy."
2,Not Much Better,"Early UFO really is hard to listen to and for the die-hard collector who must have everything they produced. Thank goodness they changed with the times and with the advent of Schenker and the ""Phenomenon"" album in 1974 ventured into heavy rock proper. This release is the same ""space rock"" style as UFO1 but not much better."
2,Indeed It's Hard,"This, The Who's final studio album, is I think the weakest of all their albums. Some people blame Kenney Jones for this. I'm going to go out on a limb and say if Keith Moon was still alive, THE ALBUM WOULD NOT BE ANY BETTER! The problem stems from the songwriting aspect rather than the performance.Although ""Athena"" was the hit of the album, in my mind the only decent song is ""Eminence Front"" maybe because it doesn't try to sound like other Who songs before it.The other songs are not bad but they are mediocre, probably because Peter Townshend's heart wasn't in it.The four bonus cuts are from the final show of their 1982 tour. It sounds like they're glad it's their final show.For completests only."
4,Not their best album,"Though The Who is and always has been my favorite band, I have to say, this particular recording is a bit of a let-down. Honestly, four words surmise how I feel about this cd: It needs Keith Moon."
4,first class Who,"Critics who lambast this fine album prove that many people's musical perception is based entirely upon common concensus. If the DJs and the critics say you're a has-been you can safely bet that a majority of a band's former fans will fall in line and dismiss an album before even listening to track one. As a casual Who fan who used to care only for the hits, I was surprised to find that this album rocks as hard and as smartly as their best work. It's a sad but true fact that most bands are only allowed about ten years before radio decides that you're done and that hip fans need to move on to whatever radio is currently selling."
1,This album simply sucks.,"I would have rathered the Who depart gracefully than to release this turd and taint their legacy. The mix, the songs, the lyrics, the groove, the riffs on this album sucks. It was an 80's infused Who attempt that failed bad at least for me, I tossed this out about two minuites after finishing the final song."
4,A Good Album!,"Though, not the best album put out by ""The Who""; it has some really good songs and great sound quality. Daltrey plays some awesome rhythm guitar on a few songs. There are a few songs that Pete Townshend later released on solo albums; but here they're sung by Roger Daltrey, who packs a noticably powerful vocal punch! I do miss Keith Moon Though..."
3,It's hard ... not to to like this record,"Now this is more like it. The Face Dances fiasco seems to have focused the Who on making a better record, and if there's something a little calculating about it -- it's as if they're consciously trying to recreate the 'Who sound' -- its slickness is its salvation. Terribly underrated; despite some clumsy lines Athena is a keeper, as is Cooks County, the incredible Eminence Front (Townshend's last great Who song), the gentle One Life's Enough and Entwistle's hilarious One At A Time (could have done without his other two tracks, though). My own personal standout is Why Did I Fall For That, a lovely big pop song like they used to do in the 1960s. Roger's singing great, Kenney's drumming is perfect (not Keith-style, but then it didn't need to be), Pete's in fine vocal form and playing great guitar ... It's hardly their finest achievement but it's got great moments and wasn't at all a bad one to go out with."
2,The Definitive Version?,"The limited edition import is part of a 12 CD Who series issued by Polydor in Japan (POCP-9208). As with the rest of the series, this release reproduces the orignal LP artwork in a miniture cardboard cover/inner sleeve. It also includes a lyric booklet and a section from a Who discography. The CD itself is the Polydor/MCA re-master, with extra tracks, originally released in Jun 97.Despite the loss of Keith Moon, and the developing rift among the remaining band members, It's Hard has some excellent songs in Eminence Front, I've Know No War, and Cry If You Want. Critically, it will never get support from old time Who fans, but it deserves a fresh listen now and then.The domestic 97 re-master is fine for casual fans; the limited edition import is a must for those who want the complete set of the Japenese series."
3,why was this remixed?!,"Sadly, the remix/remaster of this fine album is another example of historic revisionism. I thoroughly enjoyed this album, but the remix was a terrible idea. They changed the drum parts on ""Cry If You Want""!!! This was one of Kenny Jones' finest drum parts on a Who album...terrible choice in changing it. If you loved this album back in '82, then buy a used copy of the original cd...much cheaper too. Buyer beware!"
2,All the Best went into Empty Glass and Chinese Eyes,"That about sums it up. Those 2 solo albums have 10-12 GREAT songs from over a 3 year period of Townshend inebriation. What were the odds that anything decent would end up on Face Dances and It's Hard? You have to love these 2 WHO albums for what they are. If you saw the tour as I did, these songs all have special meaning. Less than a few good songs here, but generally, I can listen to this album without barfing, mostly for the nostalgia element.The years have been kind to this record I suppose. 26 Years, wow thats a lifetime. Seems not that long ago."
2,An average CD,"This album is about what you'd expect from a professional and accomplished rock band...which is why it disappoints, because the Who used to be so much more than that. Its a shame Townshend started his solo career while the Who were still recording since this resulted in sub-Who-standard albums like this one. Nevertheless, Daltrey's voice remains incredible and the album still contains a few nuggets like the Title track and especially Athena which is on a par with 'You Better You Bet' as the Who's best song since Moon died."
3,They didn't die before they got old,"I'm a big Who fan, but the band's final studio album does not measure up to their usual high standards. The fire of youth has been reduced to competent professionalism. That's not to say there aren't some good songs on this album. The hit single ""Athena"" and the long form ""Eminenece Front"" are probably the two best. As this album and subsequent periodic live shows have shown, The Who probably should have called it quits when Keith Moon died."
4,Kenney Jones replaces Keith Moon,The Who's first album without Keith Moon. Still great music and some very good tunes.
5,"Great classic album, their last might have been their best","This is an excellent album, top to bottom. The popular songs, Athena, It's Hard, and Eminence Front got their share of air play 'in the day' but the rest of the album is sound as well. Lyrically and musically I think this was The Who's most complete album."
2,It's OK,"Most of the songs were pretty good, but the album overall was pretty quiet. I had to torun the volume pretty high to hear it. The title track was a disappointment, because live they do it so well, but on the album it doesn't have any emotion."
2,Should've done what Led Zep did,"With Glyn Johns back as producer, this at least sounds like The Who, and ""I've Known No War"" is an underrated little gem, but like ""Face Dances"" the rest of this is pretty bad. By this time Townshend was saving his more ambitious writing for his equally awful solo records like ""All The Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes"" and ""White City"". The spirit and purpose of The Who died with Keith Moon, and without him the band was just three 60s guys adrift in a new wave. I'd like to recommend a few other post-Moon Who related projects, though. Townshends ""Empty Glass"", of course, and the new live cd from The House of Blues, and Daltrey's ""McVicar"" and 1994's out of print ""Rocks In The Head"". Long live The Who."
2,Third Rate,"Definitely a sub par effort by the Who on their final all original studio recording. Whereas the synthesizer abuse from Face Dances is somewhat curtailed on It's Hard, the songs themselves are terribly overblown and noisy with a severe shortage of captivating moments. Cooks County, Cry If You Want To, and One At A Time are especially excruciating. The single Athena is quite subpar due to its pedestrian lyrics and annoying drumming. It's Hard is a redundant mess.As for positives there surely isn't much. Eminence Front is an excellent tune with an excellent opening guitar solo and creative synthesizer effects. One Life Is Enough is a nice mood piece and Dangerous is fairly catchy. The rest isn't bad but certainly not overly memorable.For completists and die hard fans."
3,"Amusing, but lacking in punch","Sci-Fi pinball appears, on the surface, to be a fanboy's dream, but it falls a little short of the mark in execution. The tables are themed on some amazing Fox titles that have potential that just isn't realized by the repetitive and uninspired final product. If you really enjoy Aliens, Predator, Buffy, or the fly, you will find a certain amount of amusement experiencing them in pinball form. If you are a true pinball simulation aficionado looking for an exciting Sci-Fi themed fix, then you would be better off passing on this one."
5,Kickin' Jazz,"As mentioned in an earlier review, as a jazz enthusiast, this CD has reached a turning point in music for the 21st Century.In the times that we are living in, it is a Domain of hate, unjustice, and sin. LOVE DOMAIN, is an utmost, appropriate title,for which music has been laid to and a fruitage of the spirit that all should strive to cultivate, that of LOVE.My appreciation and congratulations, to the Artists involved.Peace!!"
5,COOL!,"I love all types of music, and I think jazz is really cool. Keep up the good work guys. I'm looking forward to the next cd.my favorite song on the cd is Room Full Of Blues. Coooooooool!!!"
3,The scent is great but...,the soap tends to dry out and crack after a while. I rate is ok..but not the greatest.
4,A real sleeper,"Not a perfect movie by any means. There are places where it could have used a bit of editing. The premise seems formula enough. But watch this movie and then the classic ""gal-pal"" movie ""Thelma and Louise"". The similarities are striking -- and this one came first. I particularly like Peter Coyote as the tortured policeman who keeps trying to bring the story to a close before things get out of hand. Dean Stockwell, unfortunately, is a disappointment as the district attorney who wants to be attorney general, and some of the business he gets to do doesn't make a lot of sense. Still, this is a chance to see both Helen Slater and Christian Slater in early roles. And enjoy it both for its sense of fun and its message."
5,Worth the wait!!,"What a pleasant surprise when I received this DVD: widescreen anamorphic, cleaned-up picture, and great audio. I was expecting just a straight video transfer from an old video archive. Many thanks to Sony and Warner Bros for producing a quality product. It is a DVR transfer, so the disc you get will be a DVD that the company burned from a data file, but it plays beautifully and it was probably the cleanest picture I've ever seen of the movie. Plus it kept all of the original music - by far the greatest gift they could give for this product - the soundtrack is awesome. I wuold recommend this to anyone who is a big 80's movie buff :)"
3,movie,"Quality of the movie was a little fuzzy. Other then that it was fine. Packaging was perfect, no scratches on disc."
5,"A classic must be out on DVD, what's keeping Billie Jean from it?","Incredible movie, great acting, and brings back a lot of memories from the 80's. It needs to be out on DVD. It's a great nostalgia thing, just when the Shopping Malls were so cool back in the 70's and 80's, the one that is featured in here I think it's the Sunrise Mall from Corpus Christi. Hope that the DVD release will see the light of day someday not far away."
5,Great surprise!,"i watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago - it's a great 80s picture and i immediately decided to purchase it when the end credits came up. After reading some reviews and doing some research, i was kind of disappointed to see that there is no good version of this movie - or so i thought ... apparently this versions is only a dvd-r and the spanish dvd is open matt/not remastered. And from reading some of the reviews here on Amazon i was expecting a bad copy. i received the movie yesterday and was positively surprised: this is no dvd-r and the picture quality is excellent. I compared it to the HDTV Version, which is really bad in direct comparison. This is a great release and everyone who loves this film should buy it."
5,Great Old School Movie,"This is a must see movie for good vs. bad, right vs. wrong crowd. My kids liked it too; however, it does have some cussing in it that I didn't remember. I recommend it."
4,billie jean,"This movie is a great movie. It is before my time and I still like it. It is a movie I can re-watch anytime. The Pat Benatar music is great. I am a fan of hers so it is great to hear. Christian Slater in one of his early roles,.... even though his sister (Helen) steals the role it's still a great watch. If your a fan of 80""s movies this is one to add to the collection... ""FAIR IS FAIR."""
5,Fair is calling this movie great!,"I just watched this movie again for the 100th time and continue to think its one of the best movies of the 80's. It really captures the feeling of life in the 80's and what it feels like to be a smart teenager who gets treated unfairly. The soundtrack is also awesome- Billy Idol, Wendy O. Williams and Pat Benetar. I read that Benetar loves to rip this movie up in concert before singing the theme. Too bad she is such a idiot not even knowing the coolness that is this movie. Check it out- Fair is Fair! Oh and the Joan of Arc refrence gives it some alternative flair."
5,Legend of Billy Jean,This is one of my favorite 80's movies. Where is the DVD version? My money is waiting for you......
5,Bought as a gift,I love this movie but got this one as a christmas gift for someone else.. I think they will like it.
4,80's treasure!,"Awesome retro flick featuring a VERY young Christian Slater and Super Girl, Helen Slater. An absolute must see for 80's nostalgia lovers."
5,Classic,I love this move and the seller was awesome .brand new i was originally just thinking of getting it from Netflix and never returning it
4,Great Movie,It has been so long since I have seen this but it is a great classic movie. I am so glad I get to add this one to my collection of movies.
2,Was not pleased.,"I gave two stars just because the product arrived. However, the dvd case was cracked and the dvd was moving freeling inside collecting scratches. Willing to forgive the cracked case, I put it in the dvd player discovering that the quality of the dvd is that of vhs and was supremely disatisfied. The entire product looked like it was created on a home computer and was not worth my 19.99 plus shipping. Will not order again."
4,DVD RELEASE PLEASE!,"A great small film. The premise is a little corny but over all, the movie is a classic. It a starts when a brother ( Christian SLater) and Sister Bille Jean(Helen Slater) are chilling at a lake when the town bully who has a crush on the Bille messes up the brothers vespa. They want him to pay for the damages and he and the bully's father refuses, So THE LEGEND OF BILLE JEAN begins standing up to the police, the community, their parents, with the help from their friends leave town because of another incident which they are to blame injuring the Bully's father find salvation on the Media and turn into a Joan Of Ark stance.Haven't since this in a while,,waiting on its offical DVD release."
5,The Legend Of Billie Jean DVD,"One of my all time favorite 80's movies. I love 80's movies, music, sitcoms mainly because it was the era I grew up in. I was hestitant at first to purchase it from Amazon due to some bad reviews from customers. I did not want to take a chance of getting a bootleg copy. Well I ordered it on a Friday, to my suprise it was waiting on me when I got home from work Monday. I was so happy.....it was brand new. Case was brand new, dvd was brand new and it played perfect. No complaints and I am very happy and satisfied!"
5,absolutely love,I love the movie and wanted to watch it again. After 20 years of not seeing this movie I had to buy it. I can watch again whenever I want. LOVE IT!!!!! :)
5,Great classic,If you like the movies of the 80's you will love this it's a It's a reminder of how movies were made in the past Before CGI
3,GOOD 80'S MOVIE...WHERE'S THE DVD ? ? ? ?,"Why is this movie not on DVD? There are thousands of titles that have been released that don't deserve to see the light of day,but this is a pretty good little film! After a crazy mishap with the owner of a store, a group of teens try to stay one step ahead of the law until they can straighten things out. The movie stars Helen and Christian Slater(no relation)."
3,Good fun movie,"At this time, November 2009, the movie has not been officially released. According to an interview with Yeardley Smith she was thinking it would be out the summer of 2009. I imagine it will be out before to long, a digital copy for instant play is now available at Netflix.This has become a cult classic, so keep holding out for this fun movie."
5,RELEASE THE DVD!!!,"That's all I have to say. I loved this film and would like to see a DVD release of it. I wouldn't expect a 2 disc special edition, or a remastered video & 5.1 audio (although it would be nice!!!), just a standard issue DVD release would make me happy. Please, release this soon!!!"
4,Accessable Overview of Jewish Music,Heritage of Jewish Music is NOT a history - it is an overview of the many influences and cultures that make up Jewish Music. It is easily read by the lay reader and an important source for the Jewish music professional. It includes a plethora of musical examples. I highly recommend this volume for anyone interested in Jewish Music.
2,Not what I expected,"Book came without the dust jacket. If I knew that was to occur, I wouldn't have bothered with the purchase. Contacted seller who said he didn't have one and apologized. Refunded some of the cost . Nevertheless, I would not have made the purchase at all if I knew I wasn't going to get the complete product."
3,No Other God,"It's a few months since I read this so the comments will be brief. As with much Death of God theology I found No other God, despite its brevity to be difficult to follow in parts. Much of that I think is that I simply don't have the background in Continental philosophy.However, I did find this book engaging in its assessment of the relevance and intelligibility of God-talk, particularly in the dialectic of the World and the Word. In many ways this book represents a theological attempt too come to terms with and embrace secularisation.Not the easiest read, but worth the effort."
4,Great small set,"The picture on the Sony is clear as a bell and very easy to see, even from several feet away. My only reservation about the set is how high I have to turn up the volume in order to hear it. This may be a function of its' sitting under a cabinet in a corner of my kitchen, but I really need to crank it. It also doesn't mask the static if I turn my satellite receiver off before the set (my other sets do). However, I like the set well enough that I'm considering getting another one for my upstairs bathroom."
2,Sony KV-9PT50,"Great picture until it went black after 2 years. Looked inside and found it cheaply manufactured. The tag inside read Made in Tijuana, Mexico. That old sucking sound coming back to haunt us.That's all I have to say"
5,Max your Strategy - must read at least 3 times!,"Fantastic read! Dauten is brilliant. Short, easy read that isn't cluttered with lots of charts, graphs, diagrams and theories. Believe it or not, I read the book in Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport while waiting for a flight. Read the book the first time in an hour, couldn't put it down till finished! Each subsequent reading took longer. This book has to be read multiple times. You will get more creatively charged up and get more out of it each time you read it. One of my dreams is to meet Max someday. After reading the book, I feel like I was actually there with Max and the businessman.Recommend for anyone who has a job, from the clean up person to the CEO.I can't believe this book didn't make the Bestseller's list! It's Outstanding."
5,Great CD.....One glaring omission!!,"This is a wonderful collection of music so diverse as to please most listeners at least some of the time. However, to echo an earlier review - I was horrified to find the music which accompanied the caprio/diaz dance sequence to be missing!! This track (whatever it's called?) was 'screaming out' to be on the compilation...So lets have a GONY 2!!"
3,question,"i am also wondering what the name of the song is when the first fight scene ensues, with priest dying. someone please help me if they know it."
1,No Thanks,What is worse than Scorsese's historically inaccurate portrayal of Herbert Asbury's iconic book about mid-nineteenth century New York City? How about a horrible cast and even worse soundtrack. Scorsese may be a New Yorker but he knows absolutely nothing about the City's history or how to cast for a movie. Skip this if you can.
3,Just don't works alone,"while in the movie the music sounded excellent, here it just chaotic...I loved the irish/cosmopolitan sounds that were the background for movie action,but without movie it sounds empty.but some tracks stand alone proudly - these are the Afro celt sound system,U2's ""hands that built america"" and different version of ""Signal to noise"" from Peter Gabriel's ""Up"" album...i love the movie, but as is said before,without movie it doesn't sound the same..."
2,Really bad picture quality.,"Kimba The White Lion is a classic anime series that has been released on DVD by several different companies. The ""Ultra Edition DVD set"" has the original Kimba; the others have later re-workings of the series. This DVD here is one of 4 Kimba DVDs released by Genius Products. It comes in a carboard envelope and contains 2 Kimba episodes: ""Rumble in the Jungle"" (original title: Battle at Dead River) and ""A Flood of Grasshoppers"" (original title: Insect Invasion). These are the 1993 version of Kimba, not the original. The picture quality is really washed out; these DVDs were very poorly made. The only thing they have going for them is that both episodes have both an English soundtrack and and a Spanish soundtrack. Both of these re-worked episodes are also available on the Bazooka Joe Presents Kimba DVD with much better picture quality, but without the Spanish soundtrack."
2,You can't have it all,"I guess it's just too much to ask to want a novel with a great setting, a plot centered around diving, and a little plausibility. Mr. Poyer doesn't develop his characters much, and misses a great chance to describe the book's setting. He also dumbs down descriptions of diving and diving related maladies. (I think if readers can hang with Michael Crichton and Tom Clancy they could handle an accurate description of nitrogen narcosis). Plausibility is the last straw, though. Nobody could buy this plot."
4,"Hatteras Blue, Tiller Galloway","I expected more, since this was the first of the Tiller Galloway series by Poyer, all of which I'd read. HB was good, just not GREAT like I expected it would be."
4,Good production clever ending.,This re-telling of the classic horror tale was nicely done. I enjoyed the fresh storyline and found the production quite good. the count was the best of course and the actor who played Quincy was quyite amusing. I didn't give it a 5 * because I didnt find the role of Mina to be very good. I felt she didn't portray her part in a very believable manner and that she brought a level of humor to the whole pruduction which made it a little campy and took away some of the suspense. Still I recommend this Cd to anyone who enjoys a good scary tale and loves to listen to audio productions.
4,"This is not your father's ""Dracula""!","I don't really have a taste for vampire stories and it's a rare bloodsucker tale that entertains me. This one did. If you already know the Count and his antagonists and are ready for a fresh take on their adventures, here's one. (Sound Mind Theater's) production chops are solid... soundscaping is subtle; music is confined mostly to transitions but is variegated and emphasizes the action without overrriding voices. All in all, this one works."
4,Quality Issues? Let's be clear.,"It is possible that the latest edition has failed to explain why the format for the images is appropriate. I have the 1987 Pantheon edition. The new edition looks like a fairly exact copy of my 1987 copy by Pantheon. That book takes as its model the 1933 first edition. The images are matte because the original and the Pantheon are heliogravure prints, a matte process. (It is also likely that Brassai's original prints lack the hi-gloss sheen common to modern magazine printing and plastic-coated photographic paper. I have nothing but pity for those who cannot appreciate such a process and yearn for something like today's glossy magazines.) The quarter-inch gloss frame arond the images is a feature of the Panthon edition, as well (and the '33?). This new book looks (on superficial viewing) like a faithful effort on the part of the publisher. Now- someone offer an A to B comparrison, please."
2,Reproduction quality is an insult to Brassai,"One only has to compare the nicely reproduced dust jacket photo to the print of it in the book to see the amount of detail that is lost in the rest of these images. Even the thumbails in the back next to the writeups show more detail than the muddied out larger vesions in the book. Brassai's images are so great that even muddied up like this they are worth looking at, but what a shame the publisher didn't do better. Shame, shame, shame."
3,Latest edition of Brassai: Paris By Night.,"This book is very important. Paris By Night by Brassai is a book that is central in the history of photograhy.It has been a great inspiration for many photograhers (and others).It is a shame, that this edition is very badly printed (loss of detail).I am sorry to say, that therefore the book is too exspensive.I bought the book anyway. Why?Because I wanted to have it on my shell. To study it. And because it reminds me of the first time, twenty years ago, when I saw some of the pictures from Paris By Night, and found that photograpy could be a great art."
3,It's good but it could have been better,"I've never seen an earlier edition of this book so I don't know how they were printed. This new edition definately has a couple problems. The photos are reproduced on matte paper so they don't have the sharp detail of other Brassai books. The borders are a quarter inch of jet black while the pages are matte black to the edges. This is not the best way to set off the photographs. Many of them seem to get lost in the dark, and the ink has a strong unpleasant smell. This is however still an amazing book, and will remain in my collection. It is worth the work it takes to study the pictures. My reservations about the book itself certainly do not carry over to the photos. Brassai may have been the first photographer to fully understand the night, and he has taught us all to ""see"" in the dark."
4,Paris By Night,"Brassai was probably more responsible than most for generating the noir genre associated with Paris but that, I think, was a function of his equipment. The deserted streets could be a factor of the five minute exposure while the close up shots of the street workers, of all occupations would have been necessary because of the lack of electronic flash. When looking at his pictures, we must be careful to pass them back through the filter of his time. BUT, that same filter has given us some beautifully composed images. There are no accidents. Thus, as well as a wonderful collection of very evocative images, the book can act as a reminder of the importance in engaging the intellect to make such images."
3,wasn't required for my class so I returned it,I found out I didn't need this book for my class so I returned it. Customer service at Amazon made it easy. I definitely recommend doing business with Amazon.
2,"Um, like a textbook, as you would expect","I found this book not to be worth it unless you are taking a class. It did not come with the CD that is supposed to accompany the text (so said the psychology professor). I'd have to say, stick to buying your textbooks at college. If you are not in college, go to a bookstore so you can actually look through these kinds of books really well before buying them."
5,Helping Profession,This book is a great and easy read for those in the helping profession. The author gives many interesting examples that will keep your attention. The book addresses many common issues that every helper should know.
3,Hurray for the heroine.,"I found Gabriel's Bride to be suspenseful, but the romance was not all that believable. Gabriel was a bitter man because his mother died and his father never loved either of them. Because of this, he swayed between treating Cassie like dirt and trying to seduce her. I like the way the author made Cassie a fiery and outspoken woman and how she brought Gabriel and his father together. The romance between Cassie and Gabriel was a bit rugged and I disliked the way he was always threatening or trying to humiliate her. Though I didn't find this story to be as good as her others, I would still buy Samantha James books."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This book is utter trash. The characters are one-dimensional at best. The author attempts to show emotion through adjectives. The characters are neither interesting nor lovable. Gabriel is forever threatening rape and generally doing mean and hurtful things to Cassie. The period is not believable, and neither is the romance. I bought this book based on the other reviews and wish I'd saved my pennies."
4,Gabriel's Bride,I couldn't put this book down. First and foremost do not expect Gabriel to sweep Cassie off her feet. This is a romance when somehow Cassie learns to fall in love with Gabriel. He is a stubborn yet fiesty man.Sometimes he can be the rudest most crude man and then other times (mostly when he is thinking in his head) he is the sweetest man ever.Cassie on the other hand is a fiery yet humble character mix together. With all the rude things that come out of Gabriel's mouth she really loaths him. But mostly she yearns for his attention and mainly just wants him to love her. Physically and mentally.The way Gabriel's father treats his son is probably the reason why Gabriel is such a arrogant yet handsome man. I have mix feelings when Gabriel and Cassie are together. One minute she wants him the next she hates him.But just like any other romance they too finally learn they can't live without eachother.This was my first Samantha James books and it won't be my last I read it in two days..
1,Hated It!,"In this book Gabriel is NOT a hero he is always very rude, mean adn cruel to the heroine. He basically raped her in the first love scene (if you could even call it a love scene!) Then when the she gets pregnant he yells at her for it and acts like it's all her fault! So this book was just Gabriel being rude to his wife then apologizing for it. I liked the heroine though. But I cannot see how she ever fell in love with him?! I usually love Samantha James's books but I wanted to throw this book out a window! Then at the end it just kind of cuts off with ""I love you"" which I didn't really like. I do not recommend this book. Don't waste your money on it."
2,Uncomfortable Reading,"While the author can write a great story and shows much talent in that area, I was taken back by the many 'love scenes' that were nothing more than rape. When a woman is saying now and the man forces himself on her, that is rape. I know this book is somewhat older and I most certainly hope today that this type of stuff would never fly with editors."
5,Dr. Art Ulene's Complete Guide,"Dr. Ulene's Complete Guide is an extremely useful reference book to have on the shelf. Its information is up-to-date and in-depth - and readable! Its format lends itself both to quick, specific reference and to slow, random browsing. I've found it indispensible in answering particular questions, and I've also enjoyed skimming through the pages whenever I have a spare moment. My knowledge of vitamins, minerals, and herbs has definitely increased since I've had this book, and I recommend it as a great reference source."
4,Very Nice Everyday Pen,"I recently began using my fountain pens again on an everyday basis. I am enjoying them and decided to shop the Aurora line. The Ipsilon is their entry-level model and it is very nice. Gold-plated steel nib writes very smoothly. The girth of the pen is medium, I would say. Not too fat and not overly thin. Nice for a medium sized hand. A very nice feature is that the Aurora accepts Parker cartridges which are easy to find. I chose the medium point nib. Unfortunately, there was not a fine point for me to try. The medium may be slightly more broad than other mediums but it is just fine for everyday use.I recommend this pen. It appears to be an excellent value for the money."
4,You can take Creoles out of Louisiana but.......,"Even though this is fiction, I understood this account is right on hit with many Creole families who have migrated from Louisiana. They tend to form enclaves and continue as they have in Louisiana. Grace, a young woman of twenty who is questioning everything including her sexuality wants no more of it, or so she thinks. Can she escape the smothering, close-knit family that insists in keeping its culture amongst the post-riots and uncertainty of 70s Los Angeles? This book had some comical moments and a little on the wild side with T-Papa appearing from the dead. There were some slow moments but all in all this is a must read for those who enjoy reading about those black folks that insist on being called Creole."
3,"""LOVE LIKE GUMBO"" tasted like oodles of noodles!","LOVE LIKE GUMBO was good enough for three stars, and that is only because Grace's need to be independent and her wacky family helped to place it at that rating. Aside from that, this had to be the only book that had more words than WAR AND PEACE! The structure of the book was definitely erratic, and there is such a thing as too much description. 2-4 pages to describe one thing is not a book to recommend to Evelyn Wood. It took me two weeks to read the book completely. Not a personal best. If you have nothing to do for one week, two weeks max, and you need a book to catch you off guard (like, far off in left field), then here it is. Otherwise, move on to faster pastures."
1,Leaking cannister,When this arrived by DHL the box was intact but as soon as I opened the box I could smell cologne thus finding the cannister this was contained in had not only cracked but leaked out.
3,A good thesis paper,"This is one of my favorite author's earliest books, and it quite frankly reads like a thesis paper. The editing is not outstanding to say the least, and the flow of the book is poor. From an information standpoint, I would recommend reading his other books which are much, much better and you wouldn't be missing anything."
2,Separates lashes but the teeth fell off after less than a month,"It separates lashes like a charm and if you use it carefully, it won't hurt yoru eyes. BIG drawback: more than half of the teeth fell of less than a month after starting using it! since you need to clean it everytime you use it (as it naturally gets mascara deposits in the metal teeth), you need to pull a bit on the teeth with a kleenex or a cotton. Even doing this very gently, the teeth just fell off. Very disapointing..."
2,Lot's better places to get the blues,"Listened through all the samples and that's all I need to tell that this is very average versions of a lot of great blues songs. I agree that Spoonful is the only song on this disc that seems to have the power or feeling of any previous versions of these songs.In general don't waste your time with this, instead go back and listen to versions by more credible blues artists or better yet the original artists like Junior Wells and his friend Buddy GuyPlay the Bluesfor Messin With the Kid. Try Lowell Fulson the writer of Reconsider Baby or Freddie KingTexas Cannonballwho did a classic remake. Robert JohnsonRobert Johnson: The Complete Recordingsor The Allman Bro's for Come On Into My Kitchen. Etc, etc, etc..."
2,BORING,"I am a fan of Campbell's from the Dio days for sure and I had great expectations for this release but it is simply boring. Of course it has its moments but don't waste your time. If you want to hear some SHREDDING Blues, get Dave Meniketti's 'On the Blue Side'...it will melt your face off! Sorry Viv!"
1,Vivian is out of his element--total waste of money,"I wish I had seen the previous two reviews before buying this CD--I totally agree with them. It's obvious Vivian is a guitar player, not a singer. This ""producer"" that encouraged him to record a blues album as told in the liner notes is crazy. He has great tone in his guitar, and his respect for blues music is evident by his restraint in his playing, but this is clearly not his forte--shredding is. He displays a solid vibrato in his soloing, but apart from that his blues guitar work is nothing special. And his vocal style is no good at all, especially for blues. Vivian is a great guitar player, but he needs to stick to what he does best--shredding with Def Leppard--sorry, Vivian."
1,The most horrible transfer to DVD I've ever seen,"Althought Saura's ""Antonieta"" is frequently considered as a lesser work, this movie doesn't deserve the extremely poor transfer to DVD that Vanguard Cinema made. Obviously taken from a poor TV transmission, the image shows every imperfection you can imagine. I couldn't believe that, in the climatic scene, the film shows a ""twisted"" TV signal! Frankly A BIG ROBBERY. Please, don't buy this movie (at least the Vanguard Cinema edition)."
1,Extremely poor quality recording,It is a god film but unfortunately the quality of the DVD is extremely poor. It looks as if it has been recorded from a VHS tape and they made a bad job of it. The sellers should indicate on their advertisement how the DVD was produced. That would enable the purchaser to make up his/her mind whether he still want to buy the DVD. That would be more honest....
2,Not Worth Your Time,"Technically the transfer is very poor. The cinematography is hazy and the Spanish dialogue is out of synch (obvious to anyone, even those who don't know Spanish), as are the subtitles, which often makes the film confusing. As for the film itself, it feels as though it has been drastically cut down from a much longer film. Edits seem abrupt and characters just disappear. While the name of the film may be ""Antoieta,"" it tells us virtally nothing about the woman, nor does it reveal anything about the woman who is researching her. The film's sole attraction lies in the depiction of this period in Mexico's history, for those interested in that."
4,YOU WILL FIND THIS REVIEW USEFUL,"...I have been using the unit for two months now and here is what you should expect:PROS: 1) Excellent sound quality. 2) Numerous combinations of options available for wake-up times and modes. 3) Ability topre-select specific CD track for wake-up. 4) Typical ""Sony"" beautiful styling. 5) User friendly instructions and programming.CONS: 1) Mediocre radio reception. 2) Increase Bass switch to ""on"" results in minute change in tonal quality. 3) No battery backup in case you accidentally unplug. 4) Not stereo. 5) Sound distorts at higher volumes unlike some of the $100.00satellite speakers sold for desktop PC's.Conclusion: If you have not owned an alarm clock with a CD player before, you will be surprised as to how much better yourmood will be when you wake up, when you can choose the music youwake up to. For items like this, that you can see up close, touch, and try out in the store, you can save lots of cash bybuying online and know in advance what to expect."
1,Don't buy as an alarm clock!,"This clock has the quietest ""buzzer"" I've ever heard - useless to me as an alarm clock, which is what I bought it for."
4,The slow song in the club!!!,"What is the name of the song in the movie ""Empire"" the girl on stage is singing at the club when Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo) with his fiancee Carmen, Jack Wimmer (Peter Sarsgaard), and his girlfriend (Denise Richards) went to hang out. It was the night Victor told Jack and his girlfriend Carmen was pregnant. ******The Artist Mia Rebel - ""She Says"""
5,Song name?,Does anyone now the name of the song that plays when Vic goes to see La Colombiana and he gets into the Black Lincoln and its raining? I think Its mostly vocal music.
5,Love it! Its compact & love the devotional passages in each book of the Bible!,"I really love my bible. Its compact and easy to carry with me. The compact devotional bible is inspiring and love the devotional passages. Very happy with purchase, thanks Amazon!"
2,Bulky and Uncomfortable,The only thing good I can say about these are that they do make your ring fit better. Unfortunately they are bulky and very uncomfortable to wear. They get in the way and can actually pinch when you close your fist. I would only recommend this as a very temporary fix. You can go to any jewelry store and for around $15 can get a slim gold or silver ring adjuster that does not get in the way and is barely noticeable.
4,nice shoes,"These shoes make my arches look fantastic. I got them in black for a recital, and now I'm hooked.They are extremely comfortable, and true to size. The heels felt a little thick on the bottom when I first got them but that will wear down a little with time.I love Bloch's jazz shoes and ballet flats. They hold up really well, feel like they were made for my feet, and don't fall apart easily. If you want them to fit like a glove, buy all your Bloch shoes 2 to 3 sizes smaller that your street shoes. I like this cut of ballet flats much better than the Bloch SO258L Economy Split that my old studio required. If you have a choice in shoes, it's worth paying a bit more for the these Prolight II Hybrids. I just wish the elastic they come with came pre-sewn. I'm lazy."
5,Henley Standard Review,"This is a ghostly tale with an original twist. When inhabitants of a small community in the west of Ireland encounter the local Lissergool Ghost each one has a unique and changing experience. These simply told, pleasantly chilling stories have underlying messages about growth, being open to new experiences and facing fears that will resonate with young readers."
3,an enjoyable whodunit,"This is an enjoyable mystery set in the often underappreciated state of Rhode Island. The puzzle-constructing amateur sleuth is an interesting character and the interaction with her private eye love interest provides a means of letting the reader in on things in a natural way. I also very much liked the larger format of the book. My only quibble is that the puzzles (which are fun) are not as integral to the plot as one might wish. It stretches my imagination, at least, to think of them as providing clues."
2,Frustrated Guy's reveiw,"This game looks soooo cool. first of all i installed it, and it had a problem, and so it froze. i installed it again, and this time it worked. i played it, the title screen was sooo cool, but i was immensly dissapointed when it froze. the game will not work, and will not uninstall, so i am stuck with a usless 100mb lump in my hard drive."
5,Dad loved the book as his Christmas gift!!!,I Couldn't find this anywhere else at this price! Unique!! Really enjoyed looking through it :) Great seller! Came quickly.
1,Don't recommend it,Several things annoyed me about this film. The music was one. Talk of spirits. No coherence. Maybe read about the events on wikipedia or elsewhere.
5,Toddlers Love It,"These stories are simple but to the point. At first I didn't like the illustrations, but the kids in my Sunday school class don't share my opinion."
5,Read Aloud Bible Stories,I teach kindergarten and love giving these books as a gift to my kindergartners. They can read many of the words themselves and I love the fact that they are reading God's Word for the first time by themselves. The stories are well writtten. Accurate yet easy words. I really like volume 1 and 4 the best. I highly recommend this book.
4,Good Intro to Bible Stories,"I have had this book and others in the series and have read them a hundred times to my daughter. This is a very good introduction to Bible stories and keeps the child's attention. The reading is easy and will probably help the child learn to read as she gets a bit older. The repetition ""step, step, step"" gets old, but does reinforce the words."
5,Read Aloud Bible Stories,"This set of books is wonderful. My children adore them. Ella Lindvall does an amazing job of taking Bible stories and applying it in such a way that children grasp its meaning, and in a way that they can apply it in their life. That is such a hard task with young children. It is also written in a way that makes Jesus seem personal to them - as he should. I can't say enough great things about these books - you won't be disappointed!"
5,Highly recommended,"I purchased one book and my boys (three at the time) loved it. I purchased another in the series and then finally the last two. We've got a lot of bible story books my kids had no or little interest in. These are so engaging--the writing, the pictures, the selection of stories. These stories inspire them to pretend and re-tell the stories themselves. They are also easy to use as a lesson--the story, acting it out, doing a craft. I only wish there were more in the series!"
3,"Great, but not for the petite person.....","The concept behind the added lumbar support appealed to me, but like another reviewer, I could never quite gets the straps to fit tightly enough or comfortably enough. I am 5""2 and smaller busted, and the back straps had a tendency to ""pucker"". After experiencing some pretty severe and unexplained shoulder and shoulder blade pain for weeks, I realized that this was the culprit. I am returning this and a new original carrier is on its way. If you are taller, it may be a wonderful product for you since it it easy to put on and off. My baby loves to face forward and see the world. I look forward to receiving the tried and true original. A quick FYI: By the end of April 2005, Regal Lager corp. will no longer be affiliated with the baby bjorn; a new company is buying it."
2,There's a better carrier,"I used Baby Bjorn original with my first child, so I was excited to try the new and improved Bjorn with my second. I was disappointed. This carrier is very confusing to use. I returned it and purchased an awesome carrier online (...) - it has great support and is easy to use. (plus, since it is made from neoprene, it keeps baby warm in the winter (and it can go in the pool in the summer!) Much happier with this one - worth checking out."
2,Beware - the back strap broke on us very unexpectedly,"This is a great product that we use all the time but beware of safety defects.This product has been recalled because of safety issues and about a month ago we received the ""new & improved"", post-recall edition (which was supposed to have addressed the defect).Well, the strap that connects the lumbar support to the shoulder straps just broke on us (Amazon's 2nd picture shows this faulty strap). We were lucky and our baby didn't drop but it was a scary moment and could have been much, much worse.We have a different version without the lumbar support and this model seems safer."
4,Great for a new born,"My daughter was born in the summer and I used this carrier all the time. I was actually very dissapointed when I had to send it in to have it fixed during the recall. I purchased a pouch and my daughter was much happier in this. She is 6 months now and in my opinion is outgrowing it. If my husband or I were taller I could see using it more, but her legs bang off of ours now and her head is up to our chins. It is very comfortable and easy to adjust. Like everything else, I wish she did not out grow it so quickly."
3,"It's okay, but....","I was really excited to get this carrier, because I have heard so many good things about it, and it does seem to be constructed really well. However, I am a short-waisted, large-busted 5'2"", and don't use the Baby Bjorn nearly as much as I thought I would because it just isn't very comfortable (my daughter is 5 months, and we have used it since birth). It is hard to keep the lumbar support in the right place, and the straps tight enough, without totally squishing my bust. On the plus side, my broad-shouldered, longer-torsoed 5'10"" husband is perfectly comfortable in it, and our baby girl loves riding in it (sometimes, during a colic spell, it was the only thing that comforted her- but it was usually my husband who would carry her around). Also, when she is front facing, I have to safety-pin the flap down, because it keeps flipping up in my daughter's face. Now that she can sit up by herself, I am hoping to have more success with a backpack carrier"
2,Waste of money,"I had a snugli with my son and ""upgraded"" to a bjorn when my daughter was born because I had heard such good things about them. My daughter was comfortable in it for the most part, until I had to get her out 7 into her carseat/bed/to change her/ & anywhere else. It was hard to use, and the extra straps on the active model were a serious pain to mess with. Honestly it wasn't much more comfortable than my snugli, and it was much more expensive. I bought a pouch sling & she is much happier. Plus it isn't a hassle to get on & off or get baby in & out. I returned it after giving it a good try. I am glad I was able to return it."
5,This is great!!,"My child lives in this thing!! She is 3 months old and LOVES to be held! I put her in the bjorn and carry her around the house. She falls asleep in it within a matter of minutes and I get all of the cleaning done. I have cooked dinner, cleaned bathrooms, and even done my make-up with her in it! We recently went to disney world on vacation and my whole famiy was able to use the bjorn (they are all shapes and sizes) I love this thing and strongly recommend it!! The only downfall is attempting to take her out of it while she is sleeping."
5,Darn Good Music,"Love the melodies and words. I love music I can relate to, especially when it's done with thought and feeling from the inside!"
3,Amazing singer/songwriter... pretty good compilation,"As is the case with most 'best of...' compilations, there are some songs I would omit (perhaps he wanted them included for personal reasons) and some songs that are notably absent (as someone mentioned, Waning Moon is one). It's a subjective thing, of course. After adding it to my collection (on my PC), I made my own 'best of...', and found I had only included 10 songs of the 19 on this disc. My version has a total of 17 songs. I added Synesthesia, Waning Mood, 1000 Years, Surrender, Fight for the World, Untitled, and This Father's Day. Again, it's subjective. This disc certainly gives a good overview of a brilliant body of work."
3,lots of bending,"To make the wings flap/play the sounds, the child has to bend way over (the directions say 30-degree angle, but we find it's more like 90-degrees) then stand back up. We had to try this several times to get the wings to work. They play for a few seconds, then stop, and you have to bend over again to get them going. Finally, my child crawled around on the floor and found that crawling kept the wings flapping/playing sounds for the most part, but they sometimes shut off and won't come back on for several seconds, or until we reset it by shutting them off and on. We bought these for $21.99. When they work, my daughter loves them. The box says they play music, but that's a stretch of the imagination. They play sound effects you would expect to hear when a fairy waves a wand, etc."
4,My daughter loves these!,"My daughter got these for her 7th birthday in October. At first I couldn't figure out how to make them work, but after I read the instructions (duh) they worked just great. I let her wear them to a birthday party (not her own) and to school for Halloween and they're still in great shape. The batteries are still going strong. With care, these wings will last a long time."
3,Wonderful Performances - Tedious Screenplay,"This film has wonderful performances by Judi Dench, Jim Broadbent and Kate Winslet. However, the plot can basically be summarized by: aging author gets Alzheimer's, slowly begins to lose her faculties, and dies. There are no surprises here. It can be very difficult to watch, and it depicts Alzheimer's with reality. Thankfully, there are flashbacks to Iris Murdoch's younger years, which relieves some of the relentless downward spiral of this film. However, I found myself wanting to see much more of Ms. Murdoch's life than what is portrayed here."
3,Pretty good film,"As expected, the acting is top notch, and I was interested in the historical setting, but overall I found the movie a bit slow. But happy I saw it."
3,Too jumbled...,"The movie is about famed novelist and writer Iris Murdoch. And if you want to know information regarding her achievements look somewhere else. However, if you want information concerning her personal exploits, then this film will keep you interested. For me the problem with the film is that it jumps back and forth too much. From Iris's reckless youth, to her degenerative brain disease later in life. It also concerns her companion husband, played superbly by Jim Broadbent (who earned an academy award for his performance). However, since the film jumps back and forth so much, the film suffers from the lack of a narrative formula. However, the movie is saved by wonderful performances.Warning: If you are looking for a dedicated love story than this film is not for you. It seems the two main charachters live together because it's more comfortable, not because they love each other."
5,Great story,Had often read about Iris Murdoch and very much enjoy her poems and quotations but never really knew her story. Great movie. Great cast.
4,Anthony Minghella's fingerprints are all over this film.,"The great Anthony Minghella's fingerprints are all over this film, even if he only produced it and did not direct. His trademarks are here: the magnificent music, acting, cast, and a bold new direction for a film to take. All four of the principals, both young and old Iris and her boyfriend/husband, give stellar performances. This a film about a woman and her relationships -- with words, with her mind, with her friends, but above all with her enduring boyfriend and husband. It's touching, heartwarming, and heartbreaking to see the devotion, admiration, and adoration between them, especially looking from his eyes. A fine film, and one certainly not cast in any hollywood mold, which is such a treat to uncover. (hollywood is not capitalized on purpose.)"
4,Ode to Iris Murdoch,"This movie is based on the reminiscenses of John Bayley, the husband of Iris Murdoch, an English novelist and philosopher. Scenes of the early part of their courtship and love affair are juxtaposed with her later descent into madness, as her husband ministers to her growing needs. The performances of Judith Densch and Ben Broadbent are nothing short of remarkable and catch the roller-coaster existence of these two literary giants with wonderful clarity. For sensitive viewers, be forewarned, the subject matter is depressing and is certainly not light entertainment."
2,never got off the ground. iris.,"Flash back forward and sideways (not really).Not worth [$] tired of paying that much for a movie and thennever seeing it but 2 x's. I love to watch movies over and over.Like Sweet November,A Beautiful Mind,Things To Do In Denver When You Are Dead (great movie, great acting, great clothes and great beauty and of course a good strong story line and finally greatphrases, The Big Sleep, a bunch more."
2,"And I thought ""Sylvia"" was a waste of an evening...","I'm not qualified to disagree with the glowing reviews of the acting, etc., but I was annoyed by the way the flashbacks were done. I suppose it was a metaphor for what Iris must have been going through.But LOTS of people are slutty or succumb to Alzheimer's. What made Iris noteworthy was her writing. To focus on the former and almost entirely omit the latter is shamelessly manipulative, and it made my girlfriend, who lost a grandparent to Alzheimer's, cry.I suppose the moral of the story is: Don't watch movies; read books instead."
2,Depressing,I didn't appreciate the movie and it's sad rendition of a slut who died of Alzheimers. I failed to see any redeeming quality in this movie.
3,"The book is an oldie, but the disease is still with us.","I read this book years ago, but never dreamed the day would come when I, too, would be diagnosed with breast cancer.The experiences Betty went through are much the same as what most of us go through after we hear the diagnosis; however, over the years, treatments and medications have changed allowing us a great chance of survival. Like everything else in life, there are no guarantees.I like the way Betty told her story, because she had a positive attitude about her illness, which is half the battle in itself. She never portrayed the ""poor me"" attitude and is an inspiration to others. However, it is an older book and I found some of the statements a little redundant in view of the changing times. For this reason, the book rated three stars. Overall, I still enjoyed the book."
3,Worth The Read,"This book is a good read for those who want to have a good easy take on this subject. However, I found chapters 8 & 9 and the epalog the best. Read it in less than a day. Having been in medicine for 30 years it's an okay read. Betty is a wonderful writer and I might read her other two books some day."
2,"First, You Cry","I bought this book for a friend who has Breast Cancer and only read some of it, however, she has told me it is very helpful and she is getting a lot out of it. There is nothing like hearing from someone else who has had some or all of your experiences and this is done well and in a very positive fashion."
4,Good Camera But Very Basic,This camera takes very clear pictures and is very easy to use. I bought it about 3 hours ago and so far my only complaint is that it does not shoot in black and white or sepia and the software that comes with it does not convert to black and white. I was dissapointed in this. I bought it at an Army PX for $145.00 tax free. I wanted a simple camera that I could just leave in my purse to capture all the moments and it will serve that purpose very well. I will probably purchase a better photo editing program though.
1,such a waste,"This is the second time I have purchased this camera. Both times, it lasts for a couple of months and then it just stops working. It takes good pictures and has nice settings for taking various pictures but none of that really matters because it doesn't last long. Now, whenever I try and turn it on, it stays on for a second and then shuts off after a couple seconds. It is cheap, compared to higher quality cameras, so I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Yassir,"Unexpected quality, cheap material, I doubt that it is from sony.May because it is made in China???even the picture quality are bad.I regret buying this item and don't recommend pthers to buy."
2,Sure NO NO for families with kids!,"We got this camera a month before bcos it looked a very good bargain for its features versus its price. Good things about the camera are its sleek design, battery life and decent pricing. However, the image stabilization is very bad, and almost 50% of the pictures go blur. We have a 18mon old, and mainly wanted to use this as the camera to click his pictures. We have lost a lot of wonderful moments due to the bad image stabilization of this camera. The focus and the click - both on the same button - are highly confusing... it has blurred pictures by changing focus on the subject during clicking. Many pictures also have green-brown dots on them, which are very visible when the images are downloaded.May be this camera is suitable for stagnant subjects to be clicked. But for families who want to click pics of kids - this is a sure NO NO!"
4,Sony Cybershot S700 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom,I got what I want!! I am satisfied with the qaulity of service and product quality
1,Disappointed,"I have owned three of these, and all three have malfunctioned. The first one worked for about three days, then just cut off right when it was turned on, even with new batteries. The second one did not function at all; and the third one had the same problem as the first. For the time that the first one worked, I was pretty happy with it... But I am now tired of all the problems these have given me and have moved on to a different brand. Sure, this thing might not be as expensive, but for about $20-$30 more you can get a much better camera that's actually RELIABLE."
2,"Nice description, bad product","I owned a previous one which had been broken, and so I bought this hoping to replace it. Put some brand new batteries into it when it arrived, tried to turn it on... no-go. Product arrived busted, sold it to a friend, made my money back (yay!), black listing the user I bought this from so I don't repeat this in the future."
4,Sony DSC-S700 Cybershot,I purchased the Cybershot DSC-S700 for my wife. She loves taking pictures but isn't into complicated gadgets. This camera is easy to use turn it on point and shoot. It has 3X optical zoom capability and additional features that will satisfy most photographers. I believe the Sony DSC-S700 is a great camera for the money and a wonderful gift for the amateur photographer in your family who just wants to capture the moment.
4,Buena camara con 7.2 MP,"Esta es una buena camara y a un precio insuperable, Amazon la redujo en ese momento a 99 dolares, sencillamente por el precio una excelente compra, las fotografias son de buena calidad.Ten en cuenta lo siguiente:1. Funciona con baterias AA2. La memoria interna es muy pequeña, muy pequeña!"
2,OK camera when it worked.,"This was a decent point and shoot camera when it worked. I took very good care of this camera. I did not drop it or damage it in any way. After 9 month's the LCD screen stopped working. This forced me to take several photos of the same pose/scene in the hopes of maybe taking a good picture of it. A couple of weeks after the 1 year warranty ran out, all of the pictures i took were fractured and blurred, forcing me to purchase a new camera. Like i said, when it did work, it took good pictures. But the quality of the hardware left a bad taste in my mouth. I will not buy another Sony camera again."
4,Captures the lightness of Mozart,"This is the fourth installment in Brendel's 21st century cycle of Mozart's piano sonatas. And, it is good to see that he didn't make the error of recording a live performance as he did on his 2000 recording, complete with coughing and obnoxious applause. Unfortunately, it is also the shortest and clocks in at less than 56 minutes. This is unfortunate because Brendel still has 5 more sonatas to go in order to complete the cycle which will probably not fit on one recording. If Philips had generously filled this disc then one more recording would have accomplished the task. Hopefully he gets it done before his aged fingers start to fail him."
2,Don't set your expectations high,"What a great selection of Barry Manilow songs. Unfortunately, that's about the only thing great about this karaoke CD. I tried two Chartbuster Karaoke CDs and found that Chartbuster doesn't really even try to pull off the piano preludes and postludes well, which is very noticeable since nobody's singing on those parts of the song to drown out Chartbuster's instrumentals. I thought this was especially disappointing on Mandy and Could it Be Magic. Could it Be Magic was also hacked by a minute and a half, so if you're looking for the full version you'll be disappointed. However, Chartbuster did do a fine job on the instrumental background for It's a Miracle. All in all, a good selection of songs with arrangements that fall short."
3,"This is not th NYR story, just the 1994 season and the Cup!","If you look at the name of this DVD, mislead you to think this includes all the NYR story, but after you receive it you can actually look the little letters on the cover that say, The 94 New York Rangers Story!"
5,muder she wrote,i want all of murder she wrote because i wasn't able to see all of them on tv and i wanted to watch them at my leasiur. i have a favorite and now can watch again and again. i like that she was not the scatter brain that most women are portrade.
1,Not worth the money,"My husband tried the kit and it just didn't live up to the claims on the package. Rather, I would suggest going to your physician who can order a lab test to measure the sperm counts and morphology in a much more accurate manner."
3,Tiny Lights,"I had seen this band back in the late 80's at a bar and they were so awesome and different...had never seen anything like them. Searched for them for a long time to see if they were still around. Found a couple cd's of their stuff...it's okay, I've decided they were much better in concert...the cd doesn't translate with the same energy they had onstage."
4,"Possibly the best in the series, but read A Darker Geometry.","Three stories covering Kzin involvement with Humans. All very entertaining if you like Niven's Known Space universe.The first 80 pages are a flashback style mystery set in the late 19th century and just after the first Kzin contact.The final 50 pages is an action packed black ops story set at the end of what is probably the last Man-Kzin War. It paints a great picture of what a single ""smart"" Kzin could do.Over 220 pages of this 345 page collection has been released as a complete novel with 150 pages of additional material (Author: Mark O. Martin, Title: A Darker Geometry). I highly recommend A Darker Geometry, particularly for Niven fans."
5,An excellent read!,"Three snapshots of the wars. Hal Colebatch's ""The Colonel's Tiger"" is parrticularly impressive, a blend of Gothic horror story, hard SF, Victorian detective story and a hint of Kipling. The three stories cover the wars from first contact to the first appointment of a humble and nameless Kzin as ""Ambassador"". All well-written, fast moving and with strong believeable characters, human and Kzin. A must for all fans of the series!"
3,Improper story line?,"I was puzzled by the story of how the humans first acquired the hyper drive. I think the author made a few foul ups, and am not sure that part of it fits the entire story line. Otherwise, not a bad read overall."
5,Excellent!,"If you like Sci-Fi and you like Space, then You've GOT to read Larry Niven's Man Kzin books. He's gotten together with scientists and over 20 writers and created a so-fi world unlike any that's ever been created.His sci-fi world will continue perpetuating itself long after he's gone because many young writers have bought into his sci-fi version of space as well as MANY older well established ones."
2,Not Worth Buying,"I like Suze Orman, but this was at most entertaining, I probably won't watch it a second time. It didn't really provide me with enough new information on what to do with my finances and now I am $15 further into debt. Save yourself the money and just borrow it from the library."
2,Storybook International,I bought this for a multicultural class I was teaching and am somewhat disappointed because the DVDs are marred and stop playing at various intervals and because my students(4th & 5th graders) are fairly bored with the stories.
5,Another Great New Series,"Yet again L.E. Modesitt Jr. has started the makings for a great series. It definitely has the potential to rival the Recluse series. Like in the Recluse series you get a sense of a vast history, in which you start to learn about as you get further into the books. I can't wait to read the next one."
5,Modesitt's best yet,"I read a few of his Recluse books, and they are very light, formulaic, and highly predictable. This one is wonderfully written. You really grow to care about the main character, Alucius. I can't wait to read the next one."
3,Needs proper editing but a good story,"I just finished Legacies. Modesitt is a great storyteller. I believe a better storyteller than a writer. If you're an anal critical reader, don't read this book. Read if you're looking to get lost in a story and overlook annoyances. The frequency of such problems depends on the reader. Personally I had to roll my eyes or get frustrated in confusion at least twice every session I read.Pro- I love how his story was more character based. The talent and the history of the story are VERY under developed.Cons- I gave this book a three because I was entertained but as before stated, BUT he told a story as if by mouth not refined as I'd expect from a TOR Author.All in all the book did its job. Read itRich Tijerina"
5,Legacies... an intriguing beginning,"I liked this book.The writing of this fantasy is plain and simple, no complicated words or phrases: but the story is told with the skill of a master taleteller and (just as important) with an easy readability. I found myself eager to get back to it whenever I found a spare moment.I found I liked the central figure (Alucius) and his special ""talent"". Also, there seemed to be just the right balance of magic, suspense, love, friendship and battles to make this work a pleasure to read for any fantasy/adventure fan. Recommended!"
1,Seek depth elsewhere,"This is childish fantasy in the tradition of the later work of David and Leigh Eddings. The characters and their motivations are naive and simplistic, to the point of being unbelievable.If you're a parent, this may be suitable for kids 14 years old or younger.If you're looking for a page-turner filled with gritty realism, try J. V. Jones or Steven Erikson."
2,PC pseudo-science,"This is the most fascist piece of work I've read recently. The authors have taken scientific research - or allegedly scientific research - and assigned a politically correct moral to their conclusion, which is that male higher primates are inherently aggressive and therefore ""evil."" Himmler would have been proud. Keep in mind that the Nazi's quasi-scientific thesis was that some human races are genetically inferior to others, and therefore the ""superior"" races have to assume responsibility for the advancement of humanity. The thesis of ""Demonic Males"" is that males are genetically predisposed to ""evil"" and therefore inferior to females, who therefore must be given ""equal"" (actually, superior) status so they can lead human civilization down the flower-strewn path to Peace, Love and True Happiness. Both appear to be guilty of the unscientific sin of describing genetic traits as morally good or bad; that is, if you're born an ""untermensch"" or a male, respectively,"
4,"Great introduction to design for mere mortals, and still lots of gems for pros","I read this book after I'd already spent years doing design, and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. As some have said, the examples in the book are dated - but the design principles it teaches definitely are not. It is perhaps one of the best introductions to design that I've read. Before and After does a great job of concisely explaining why a design works or does not and how to improve it. They do it in such a way that the earliest beginner can understand it but the seasoned designer can still gain tips to improve from it."
2,"Disappointing, but not useless","If you have even a modicum of page layout/design experience, this book will be nearly useless to you. It's filled with examples of how the author took a bad layout, moved some things around, added elements, removed others, enlarged or shrunk photos, and declared the result improved. Now, it's completely true - the After layouts look much better than the Before layouts - but there's little theory behind the changes, simply a series of pronouncements.Those that need a ""do this, do this, and do this"" approach that's heavy on picas, this might be your book. I found it stiff and not particularly useful."
2,Dated but Useful,Would rather recommend their beautiful magazine and/or PDF publications which come out irregularly. Every issue is a treat. Take caution however; sadly their customer service treats subscription problems with contempt.
1,Where is the rest?,"While I like the pen (I've had several over the years), I do NOT like JBHines as the seller. They shipped my order of 3 pens promptly and they arrived undamaged. However, I bought these for gift purposes, and I happen to know that when they leave the Fisher Space Pen factory they are in ""moonscape"" gift boxes with a publication about the history of the pens. When I received these pens, though, from JBHines, the three pens were simply rolled up in cheap bubblewrap, without even a package, so I had to purchase other gift boxes to use, and had no information to include for my friends. In the future, I will order my fisher pens directly from the factory (spacepen(DOT)com."
5,One of Woody Allen's Best films.,"If you feel that ""Husbands and Wives"", ""Interiors"", ""Stardust Memories"", and ""Everyone Says I Love You"" rank as some of his best works you will love ""Another Woman""."
2,Makes you long for Annie Hall,"Unsympathetic characters leading self-indulgent lives of betrayal to spouses, friends and selves.Naval-gazing New York liberal elitist intellectualism in full flower.So much for the ""life of the mind""Giving it the second star because of the skills of the actors and actresses...."
4,Count the Sniffs,"I love this movie, and have loved it for a long time. I have a little game I like to play during a certain scene--and this is only because Mia Farrow's performance does not thrill me. If you know the movie, find the scene where Rowlands finds Farrow crying in the antique shop. The game is: count how many times Farrow makes that sniffing sound with her nose before and during the ensuing dialogue. Some of the sounds are close calls, but I count 24 sniffs! Anyone else?Gena Rowlands is a marvelous actress and John Houseman breaks one's heart in his dream psychotherapy session."
1,The Worst,"Everything you ever hated about Woody Allen is here in this movie, minus everything you ever loved about Woody Allen. All of the pretentiousness, wealth-worship, self-pity, intellectual posing, and sheer bad writing and directing are here at their most overt. The characters in this film have way too much spare time on their hands, and could use a job behind the counter at McDonald's."
2,Hyper-Cerebral,"I really like highbrow drama, but this one was slow, stagey, draggy and ruminative. The first half hour showed potential but the remainder fizzled out. Disappointing!"
2,why wait,The book was quite worn; loose and torn pages and a family's picture inside . I knew it would be used but they said it was like new
2,Needs new poetry,"This book was given to my children as a gift. Currently my toddler asks me to read it to her frequently. She likes the flaps, and likes to repeat ""true"" with me after it is repeated on each page.The ""rhymes"" in this book irritate me after a short time. Take for example this non-artful example: ""Blue is for the rain that, well, just fell and fell and fell and fell."" Please. I believe that children's books, especially books pertaining to God, should be beautiful in appearance and in sound. The clunky rhymes in this book are not beautiful. Each page also emphasizes an incorrect grammatical structure ""...who God gave this special promise to."" I try to avoid books that do this.The colors are nice, the unique design of the book is nice, but I'd prefer it to be re-written."
1,"if you like . . ., poor . . . buy it.",This is by far the worst investment of my life. I've spent weeks trying to get it to work. USB doesn't work for windows 2000. You can't use the scanning software it gives you. The customer support is horrible. Never ever buy this product. I warned you!!
5,A Teriffic Xerox Product,"I have owned a Hewlett Packard 682c Color Printer for 4 years and after the warranty ran out, had nothing but problems, I also bought a Cannon 620U scanner 6 months ago, and had nothing but trouble with their TWAIN drivers, so I sold both and bought the Xerox XK35c Workcenter from Best Buy, I have had no problems like the other guy from Columbus, Ohio and had he read the manual their is troubleshooting tips for correcting the white streaks. After using this Xerox product I will never buy another Cannon scanner or Hewlett Packard printer again."
2,OK ball but wears quickly,"About half a dozen of these balls were purchased for a Y where I work out and shoot. When new, the balls had a good feel, with excellent tackiness and good pebbling. Yet, six weeks later, the balls have worn noticeably even though they have not been heavily used (this Y attracts very few basketball players). The tackiness is pretty much gone and the pebbling has worn way down, despite the fact that the balls are only used indoors. In contrast, my Wilson Evolution has been heavily used for years and is still in superb condition. It costs more than the TF-500 but is well worth the difference in price."
3,ball is fine,not the latest model in this line but the ball was the right price. good feel and easy to grip with my sausage fingers!
5,Circle of Light,"Here is a book that can you make aware of the light and dark forces that surround all of us. Frightening enough to make even the biggest of paranormal skeptics doubt their beliefs. Powerful enough to creep into your mind when you're alone in your thoughts and in your dreams sending cold chills up and down your spine. The story of Madison and her journey through life had me totally captivated from cover to cover. Emily Ann Roesly has written this book enabling you to feel the raw emotions of Madison, the sheer terror she experiences, the overwhelming sadness and frustration, to the heartwarming happiness as if you are actually there, with her circle of friends. The contents of the book stay with you even when you've turned the last page. Excellent work Emily! I am looking forward to reading your next book."
3,"A tremendous novel, a truly awful translation by Louis Iribarne","What else can I say? Daniel Gerould has done a fine job translating other of Witkiewicz' works into English, demonstrating that it can be done. Hopefully someday soon this great novel will be available in a competent English translation. (A great translation would be -- great, of course, but a merely competent one would be a great improvement.)"
5,Mary Lee is an innovative singer and songwriter.,"Three years ago I heard this band in New York City. I went to the club on the advice of a friend, and afterwards I was completely enthralled. Mary Lee was singing many of the songs on this cd at that time, proof that she and the band have been on the scene and steadily building a repertoire.The cd is a collection of varied melodic songs, some which are haunting and others which surprise the listener with their fresh lyrics. The instrumentation is nearly a ""folk"" sound, but it manages to maintain its connection to rock and roll. Mary Lee's vocals are soulful, lending an extra poignancy to the simplicity of the lyrics and instrumentation.I am thrilled to see this cd available nationally. I have been on the mailing list for Mary Lee's Corvette for three years, and I live in Iowa! Finally a star that has been hidden for too long has emerged in the sky."
3,Knife Set.,The knives are pretty dull although they do the job. Its a great set for the price. I never used the steak knives with actual steak so I dont know how well they will work with it.
1,the one-sided film,I would encourage anyone who is truly interested in the truth to attend an event personally before listening to the bitter resentment of people who feel they have been conned out of something. Make whatever choices you feel- but I at least want people to have the same chance as I did to make a personal decision. The organisation is non profit and you will not be asked or even encouraged to do anything other than listen to his message and ask questions if you wish
1,Juvenile,"This film is, and always has been, a juvenile attempt to discredit a teacher who has done much for millions around the world. The organizations that support Maharaji's work are not controlled by him and do not provide financial support for him. Nothing about him or his work fits the definition of a ""cult"".Only juveniles with little or no imagination would find this film interesting.Anyone wanting to know the truth about Maharaji or The Prem Rawat Foundation should see him in person and hear what he has to say or visit www.tprf.org. Anyone interested in the truth about Elan Vital should visit www.elanvital.org.False and libelous statements will never prevent the truth from reaching those who want to know it."
5,Anatomy of the Maharaji Cult,"This video is both hilarious and tragic at the same time. It shows the amazing gullibility and sincerity of young people in the 70s who wanted to find truth, and the willingness of a charlatan Guru to take advantage of that sincerity. For those who used to be members of the Guru Maharaj Ji cult but have been freed from it, which continues to this day, it is a powerful reminder of the power of cults and mind control. The video uses interviews, music, and a kind of wandering camera to give wonderful insights into the 1973 Astrodome event at which the Guru was supposed to reveal his plan for world peace. Rennie Davis and Abbie Hoffman provide wonderful contrasts of perspectives on the cult."
5,This document's interest keeps improving as time goes by.,"If this document hadn't turned-up on the market almost three decades later, memories of the event would have been altered and, some day, lost. It already surpasses imagination.For anyone foreign to the era and phenomenon, it gives a great insight into a cult. Chances are historians, sociologists, philosophers and theologians will benefit from seeing it. Thesis are to be written on this fringe which once pretended to mainstream.Chances are, as the story unfolds, this cult will return into the spotlight. Skeletons pop-out of the woodwork everyday now and front page stories will, one day, stop being wasted. I see a great potential for a 6 hours mini-series where footage from this document will be worth a fortune. Who owns the rights?"
5,Loved it as a teenager - still love it now,"I found this book in my mom's book shelf when I was 16 and never gave it back. The cover has fallen off and I lost most of the last page! It is exciting, colorful, sometimes funny, sometimes frightful but a great step into the history of the US through the eyes of a proud mother of 10!"
5,This was the best book I have read in the last ten years!,I am a huge fan of history but this is the best book of any kind that I have read in recent history! It is truly a page turner. It jump started my thirst for knowledge. I crave to learn more about the early history of the United States. Thank-you James Alexander Thom.
2,"Not for all ZR cameras in series, be carefull","I purchased this kit with a brand new Cannon ZR300. When the kit came after I received the camera, I was dissapointed to find out the battery was the wrong size for my camera. I checked the packaging and my camera, all the information said they were compatible, but the battery it came with was 1/2 an inch larger than the battery the camera came with, and there was no way it was going to fit.Also the case appears to be a fairly good size in picture, but I was surprised at how small it actually was. I wanted a case that would hold the camera plus all of it's cords, accessories, and user manual. There is no way this case will hold all of that, only the camera, a couple tapes and the battery charger. You would be better off to find a case and battery in person and buy them seperatly.I was unable to try out the software that it came with but I have found most of the programs that come standard with computers now are pretty easy to use."
4,Excellent Game,This is an excellent 2D war game. 3D games sometime give me a headache. Two thumbs up.I did notice a bug in one of it's missions where I couldn't escape even after finishing the mission.
1,Doesn't work with WINDOWS XP,"The Game is good I have played before but the installable in this CD will not work any version of windows other than 95 and 98. This is crap... I dont know how many people are using 98 Windows still, my purchase is waste as I can't change OS for this."
3,"Difficult game, but fun for those who try.","This game can get very hard at times but like any good game of chess it takes strategic planning in order to win. You have 6 characters in the game and each has their own skill. The purpose is to use each man together with their skills to achieve your mission. The game is tough but it is also time consuming as well as fun. The game is based during WWII in which your men go in Nazi camps and sabotage, rescue, kidnap, assassinate, etc. This game is not for everyone especially for those who get easily frustrated, it takes patience and planning to win. I recommend playing a downloaded demo to see how you like it before actually buying it. The price has reduced so i would recommend buying one now or wait as they might combine the two commando titles in one to resell."
5,Commandos Behind Enemy Lines,"Your looking for a new game right? But, your sick and tired of being bored with your new game by the end of the weekend. Not with this game my friend. You control 2-6 commandos during each mission using each commandos unique abilities to wreak havoc and mayhem on the German Army. The missions start off fairly easy, but watch out! The missions become more and more difficult as the game progresses. This game is not for someone looking for a relaxed WWII sim game. Missions can take a few hours to complete, and there's more than one way to complete each mission. I highly recommend this game for the person who enjoys a challenging(very challenging) game combined with a great storyline."
2,Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 80 GB,Description indicated drive was like new but that clearly was not the case. Drive is working however...
2,needs a major overhaul in design!,I am no means an expert in design. However this calender went from being one of the best Star Trek products on the market to somthing that makes the budget rack at the end of the year. I can't buy this anymore seeing the pictues are so small.I don't know if this is the intent of the designer or from the publisher. I wish the publisher would enlarge the pictures enough.... so you can see them accross your desk! I can purchase a generic calender instead of this one. I wish the calender could return to its glory days of large photos. I'd buy it right away.
2,Disappointing,"With technology as progressed as it is in this age, why does a production company release sub standard recordings? The video quality is that of old VCR technology, even saying that is offering more credit than the video is entitled to. The sound is mono. This would be a good video to play on your cell phone screen but play it on a home theatre setup and you will be disappointed. The only redemeaming quality of this three DVD set is the 3rd DVD. Save your money and invest in high quality. After all, that is what a DVD is suppose to be. I enjoy Iron Maiden and very much enjoy Bruce's work but this video project is a let down. I would have loved this video 25 years ago but not in 2007"
2,"Well, no one's perfect","A smarter person than I once said, ""It seems impossible for Bruce Dickinson to release a bad product."" Well, unfortunately, this seems to be it.I won't delve into the contents - plenty of other reviewers have done that.The live performances are certainly full of energy, as is typical of Bruce. The video is below average at best. While this isn't a hidden feature (it's been described a number of places, including the booklet with the DVD), the major disappointment is the sound quality. First of all, it's only provided in dolby digital stereo - no surround sound. Secondly, the live performances sound remarkably flat. In fact, the sound for the second DVD doesn't even match the quality of the CD for this show. It's too bad, because a good quality sound could have made this an awesome DVD."
4,Try M Live,"I find it interesting that M is starting to get known in the US. I'm sure those who discovered him feel blessed. I personally don't like his studio work as much as his live performances. I strongly recommend purchasing ""Le tour de M"" available on DVD and CD (I recommend both, the setlists are different). I believe these can be found on amazon.fr."
5,fantastico,written review este libro es lo maximo tienes que leerlo es tan bueno que no puedo describirlo lo comense a leer y no pare asta el final gracias Vctor Villacenor por darle valor a nuestras raises latinas
1,No apparent English version.,"I ordered this book thinking that it was written in English as are many of Villasenor's books. I received this book and realized that it was totally in Spanish. There was no indication from your review that it was in Spanish, therefore it was a total surprise. When I returned the book, I asked, in writing, for the English version, but did not receive anything more than a refund."
2,"Ugh, Avoid this book","So far, I have yet to find a more useless d20 book. The whole book seems to be a collection of randomly generated maps.The maps are typically a top down view with brief (and somewhat questionable) descriptions of what each item represents. The map quality is only passable at best and the descriptions are sometimes just plain silly.After purchasing the book, I returned it and took the shipping loss. Don't make the same mistake... avoid this book!"
3,effective and versatile hand vac for short while,The unit charges up effeciently and runs intermittantly about 15 minutes before needing a charge. The extendable brush helps sweep up small particles and the extendable nozel works really well to get into hard to reach places. Cleaning and emptying the unit is easy and the filter seems to hold up through lots of session. It is a pretty powerful unit for a cordless hand vac. One major issue is that it must be kept in the charger all the time after use. Over time the battery seems to hold less charge.
1,It's not F4,"Do not buy if you are looking for F4 filter. It does not fit model 0880, 0881, 0886, and 0887."
1,Does Not Fit All Specified Hand Vacs,"The filter that arrived actually says ""Filter Fits Extreme Power Cordless Hand Vac"" and does not say type F4 anywhere on the box. The filters themselves are about 2.75"" in diameter and 3"" long, but have a large flat plastic attachment. I'd guess the plastic is the part that fits into the frame of the hand vac. If your hand vac fits removable filters (i.e., you only throw out the used filter and a small plastic ring that is connected to the filter), then these probably aren't the ones you want. I have a Vibe Scorpion Cordless Hand Vac (model M0888VX) that takes a standard type F4 filter and these did not fit."
1,Be aware,I bought this filter because it says it would fit my Dirt Devil Jaguar hand held vacuum. The filter number on the description of this product matched the filter number of the filter I currently have in the vacuum but it did not fit.
1,Product not as pictured.,I ordered this product as a replacement for the Arm and Hammer brand to try and save a few dollars. These filters have a part not shown that did not fit my vacuum. I was able to cut the filters off and rig them up to the old parts to make them work... but I will not be purchasing these online again.
5,Great little vacuum,"Bought this one to replace a Black & Decker. So far so much better. B&D needs to come out with an inexpensive replacement battery, but too late for me. I love the Dirt Devil. Much more suction than the B&D."
3,Good Substitute,"The product was not the best but, it was a good substitute. Price was cheap so no buyer's remorse. Easy to install..."
4,Good hand held portabel Vacuum,"I bought this to replace my old Black & Decker which was worn out. I use it for occasional use picking up crumbs, lint or spilled items. It has increased power and suction over my old unit, and I am quite happy with it so far, at least."
3,"Poorly engineered, and doesn't seem as sturdy as the original filter","These filters are made of a thin white paper-like fiber, whereas the original filter was made of some type of gray cloth-like material. So far, the first of these replacement filters has held up to about 10 uses, so it may be stronger than it looks, but I can tell that it's getting pretty worn. The ones I received are definitely Dirt Devil branded, and come in the red box, shown, which was a concern that I had when ordering, since another reviewer said they were generic.Overall, I'm not crazy about this vacuum filter design, since everything you suck up in the vacuum adheres to the filter and you either have to spend time picking all the debris off of it by hand or with tape, or use another vacuum cleaner to clean it. When this vacuum stops working, I'm not going to buy this type again."
5,It makes my life much easier.,I have an indoor cat that uses a litter box. He isn't too careful about letting the litter fly out of the box as he buries the waste. For years I used a hand held vacuum with a separate charger which didn't hold the charge for very long. Even when it wasn't in use it was losing its charge. The dirt devil occupies a small space in its charger and never disappoints me when I need to use it. It is easy to empty and is always ready to go.
1,ABORT!!,"ABORT, ABORT!! This is NO horror movie. Just guys running around in Hanes underwear. NO NUDITY!! Bad acting, NO VIOLENCE (and its a horror movie???)"
4,Rather good,I am an admirer of Peggy Noonan and my mark might be biased. I failed to get any real insight into the quintessence of her writings and how her Catholicism has influenced her writing.Dr Jusuf Hariman
5,merry supremes christmas,"with sooo many holiday lps to pick from,i can tell you 3 of the best,one ELVIS CHRISTMAS,second,JOHNNY MATHIS CHRISTMAS and the third,you got it right here,THE SUPREMES!this cd gets the deluxe treatment with all the bonus tracks and theres not a christmas that go by without us playing it.how can you go wrong with christmas and the supremes!a perfect match.great songs.one of my favorites .this lp also sold more than 3 million copies for the ladies.beautiful lp and Performances,make sure you get the new remastered delxe version with the added tracks such as SILENT NIGHT,NOEL,JUST A LONELY CHRISTMAS."
4,More for Christmas,"Diana Ross, Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard actually recorded nearly two dozen songs for this album. It's a shame this beautiful piece of work is out of print but even more of a shame Motown hasn't pulled together all the recorded material into a full-collection C.D. (some of the tracks have been put on compilations). The most interesting parts of this album are the Motown originals, with ""Little Bright Star"" being an alternate lyric to a Tammi Terrell song."
5,It's baaaaack!,I remember jamming to this record during Christmas as a kid. And could never find it. Until now! Love the '60's vibe & sass of The Supremes. Brought back great memories!!
5,Little Bright Stars,"Yes indeed! It just isn't Christmas without hearing this compilation of Supreme gems. ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Me"", ""Little Bright Star"" and ""My Christmas Tree"" truly make the season bright. This extended version is wonderful - but that has all be covered nicely in previous reviews. I do wonder why Motown chose to omit ""Oh Little Town of Bethlehem"" from this collection, since they released it on a previous Motown Christmas compilation. The girls do a terrific job on that song (as they do on the rest of the Christmas songs). It certainly would be a gift to have all the Supreme christmas songs on one CD."
3,Be careful but collect this!,"This is not an album of outstanding achievement by the group that changed the ""Bossa Nova"" as a musical movement. Mendes took us beyond the Byrd/Getz phase to a more pop sound the 70's wanted. This album, however takes some classic 70's music and tries to make it brazilian. Not good, but not too bad either. Sadly, some great stuff lurks here. But if you want ""it all"" like me, you need this for the historical tracing of Mendes' discography! If you are looking for something to include in the library you are building, chose Equinox or Brazil 66."
2,"""Hero"" didn't win me over at all","Connor made a mistake by not contacting Beth after their night together. Beth was angry, miserable for years because of it and the consequences of that night. She comes home for her brother's wedding after avoiding coming home because didn't want to run into Connor. Connor is all hot for her right off the bat - even though he's attending the wedding with his girlfriend of 6 years, live-in for 3. Now that ""the one"" is back he doesn't seem to have any problem getting over the girlfriend super quick - avoids talking to her. That came off very jerk-like besides his past sins.I normally like Heidi's books but this one didn't do it for me."
2,dissapointed that the top rolls down,"I am very short-waisted and have been looking for ""undies"" that won't roll down at the waistband. I was hoping that since these panties had a wider waistband that they would not roll at the top. Unfortunately with my bodytype they do."
5,Best Panties Ever,These are supportive but very comfortable. The high cut leg hits at just the right spot. I can finally toss out all the ill fitting panties I have bought over the last 3 years. It would be nice if they included a size chart. I guessed and got mine right.
4,good,Very comfortable and nice. The only problem is that some belly fat still hangs over. Product is pretty and arrived quickly.
4,Beautiful shoe--runs small,"This shoe runs very small, which is especially problematic because it has a pointed toe--you don't want squashed toes.It is, however, simply stunning. It's practical, elegant, and very flattering on the foot."
1,Wishful Thinking,"Citing a few case histories as ""proof"" that a person with a serious mental illness/brain disorder can be pulled up without medications is lazy science. There have been studies done on thousands of people which show bipolar disorder, for example, to be genetic & schizophrenia to be due to visible (on PET scans) differences in the brain."
5,LOVE these sticks!!!,"My 9-year-old LOVES these. I bought them because the price was right, and they specifically said they were sized for kids. Not sure that would matter, but these sticks are great!!! Bright, fun colors. The tassels are nicely made from suede, and the rods are slightly tacky, like neoprene, so they have a little grip and the juggling is easier for a kid. Santa batted this one out of the park. Plus, shipping was VERY fast. They also come with a nice velcro strap to keep the sticks together, but I'm pretty sure we've already lost it. Nice idea, though. Our set came with a blue tassel rod & red juggling rods. They are very engaging, and every family member wants to get their hands on them. Lots of fun value for the price!"
5,"Heartwarming, Real and Inspiring Family Entertainment","Timeless, heartwarming family entertainment that is real and not sugar-coated throughout. As the youngest male in a family of six boys, and the offspring of depression-era parents, this film touches my heart in magical ways. It continues to be one of my favorite films since first viewed over 10 years ago. I highly recommend it."
3,Planet Storybook Awaits!,"Remeber Grover the Waiter and his chubby blue customer? This video is a great chance to visit them again - Grover has ""worked his way up in the food business"" to become a Planet Storybook (read Hollywood) waiter and change the unhealthy eating habits of his favorite customer. Along the way are lots of gags about storybook characters (Grover trips over Jack Be Nimble's candlestick, for instance - and the restaurant is decorated with memorobilia like Cinderella's glass slipper) Very cute.I think I'm not cool enough to enjoy the song clips, but if you and your kids enjoy spoofs, you'll like them: ""Cereal Girl,"" Cookie monster rapping about ""Healthy Food,"" and bologna, cheese, and bread singing ""Telly's Lunch"" (Brady Bunch Theme) I liked ""Blueberry Mouth,"" a Leon Redbone style (?) tune about blueberry picking.I don't know that it made any difference in eating behavior with my son, but he's a pretty good eater anyway. He enjoyed it, though: particularly the singing broccholi."
3,For older kids,"I bought this video for my 19-month-old son who is a Grover fan. (Note to previous reviewer - Elmo is the red one - this video is hosted by Grover.) Although he still finds it somewhat entertaining, the songs are a little few and far between and it's pretty preachy about trying lots of types of foods. Unless you're having this problem with your child, I'd recommend something else."
4,Let's Eat Has Lots of Entertainment Value,My 22 month old daughter has been faithfully watching this video for months and it is one of her favorites. It is one that I don't mind watching either.
5,let's eat,As they say in espanol ESTUPENDO. Great songs fabulous presentation and it works. Couldn't rate it highly enough. Lo Mejor The other titles I have purchased were also of a high standard and most enjoyable.
1,"As the Monty Python group said ""run away!""","These look identical to the ones installed in my Mother's new home. Within a year they were jamming. With a little bit of use, the friction built up and they became hard to retract.First, the catches are not balls, they are non-rotating bullets, made of very thin metal.Good news is that they were easy to install. Drill a 1 inch hole in the door, and hammer the catch into it. Surface mount the strike plate. No mortise work required.It is a bit harder to pry them out and throw as far as possible."
4,Good reading,"I enjoyed reading this book, but found it a little smutty at times.Gives one an insight to what it must be like to be overweight."
3,Not her best...,I have greatly enjoyed Lynne Murray's books in the past. This one was just OK... moved slowly and many of the character's in this book just were not likable or interesting.
3,LARGELY ENTERTAINING,This is the first book I've read by this author and the first l've read where the main character is a woman of substance...it is refreshing to learn that some folks actually believe that ample flesh does not result it a scarcity of brain cells. I look forward to reading more from this author.
2,Soso,Probably would have helped if I had read the first mystery. Was difficult to figure out why certain things were happening.
1,Not my kind of book,It seemed very boring. I like to read before bed. I kept falling asleep when reading it. Some one else might like it. There was no real mystery to it.
1,Bleah,I couldn't even read it. I read a few pages and the characters were so preposterously written and the dialogue so improbable that I decided not to waste my time.
1,Big Girls,"The book was so concerned about keeping us informed about her large size that it didn't develop a strong story line. I did not finish the book,so it may have gotten better. I will never know as I do not intend to force myself to read this book."
2,At Large,"Did not read all the way through. It did not appeal to me, so I cancelled it. I don't like paying for something and the cancelling it."
4,"Great for readability, poor on consistency with ancient languages","The New International Version is excellent for readability and overall quality. However, because it is only 52% consistent with the original language (Old Testament comparison only) you cannot do serious bible study without using a concordance.The Strongest NIV Exhaustive Concordance (Strongest Strong's)"
1,Product Was Not Effective At All,"We used this product on our kids in July and August 2009 at Gulf Shores, AL. I swam in the ocean as well, almost as much as my kids but without this product. I had no jelly fish stings, and my son's had seven stings between them.So, I cannot say this product works at all.Keith Walker"
5,Super sun lotion!,"Protects and doesn't sting the eyes when you sweat. My husband fishes, etc., and this is the only sun protect he'll use!"
3,How would you know???,Purchased 2 bottles of this for a trip to the Caymans. It comes with no safety seal or any type of wrapping. Could be just plain old lotion for all I know. My daugther did get whipped by a jellyfish. Hard to tell if it works or not. Better safe than sorry so we thought we would try it. Would probably use it again.
1,Really bad Sean Bean movie,"I remember reading someone saying that the plot was muddled. It was. The ending was one of the worse I've seen in movies. I expected Sean Bean and his compatriots to get even, but all they did was get their as**** kicked by the Gov't. I mean, just when you think his little army of misfits are going to complete what they set out to do; they bollix (or bollox) it up.Even Bob Hoskins part in helping out the ""vigilantes"" was predictable and so bad you knew when ""his time was up."" Bad script and bad direction."
3,outlaw,Good point to the movie just filmed cheesy. Over all good movie would recommend to watch once. Rock n Roll
5,2000 Nissan Frontier King Cab,"My wife bought me this for Christmas last year. It really is nice for the money. Easy installation in about 30 minutes. The bars being affixed to the cover is really nice. Customer service is also top notch. I broke the tab on the left side, emailed them, and in less than a week I had a complete replacement set for both sides, no charge no questions asked."
2,USeless,No doubt air gunners (or anyone involved in the murderer skies of Europe in WW II) should receive all the credit they deserve. They payed with blood to accomplish their missions. But air gunner were the clear champions of overclaiming in WW II.
5,alexz johnson amazing songstress,this album is sooo good. ive listened to it over & over again. I would highly recommend it to any1 who likes upbeat songs. Superbe Alex!!
5,Hot Music Man!,"I heard about this album from the show Instant Star on Noggin. That ""24 Hours"" song was really catchy so I got this CD. I'm not disappointed at all. The whole thing is just great. With a rock edge that's still commercial, this CD would be a huge hit on its own terms, without the show. It's at #36 on Amazon as I write this, and it hasn't even been officially released in the States yet. I hope this really does well. It already has a built-in audience for fans of the show like me, but it could reach a wider audience with the right single and marketing. I have high hopes for Alexz. She has a good voice and a good sound. Good times."
4,Great CD,"Being a singer/songwriter myself, i've been wishing i could watch Instant Star since the time i heard about it. But of course, we dont get it here. So when this CD came out, i decided to get it so that i'd have an idea about what the show was all about.I didnt really get an idea what the show was all about, but i got to listen to some GREAT music. Alexz voice is amazing and this is the right genre for her.Some songs are of course better than others, but the whole album is really good. Very listenable and enjoyable. The best songs on the album are ""24 Hours"", ""Waste My Time"", ""Me Out of Me"", ""Pick Up The Pieces"", ""It Could Be You"" and ""That Girl"".I'd surely reccommend this album to all pop/rock lovers. Fans of Skye Sweetnam and Avril Lavigne will love Alexz Johnson."
3,It's Alright...,"I don't watch Instant Star, so I'm writing this review based purely on Alexz's tracks and vocals. For starters, I think that most people like her because she's on a television show, not because of her music. Her music is alright, but it sounds just like lots of other rock influenced pop. Her voice is pretty good most of the time, but when she tries to hit some of those high notes, it sounds so painful that I cringe. Her songs have the sound of deep, meaningful rock tracks, but when you really listen, the lyrics are typical of a teenager and have nothing individual about them, plus Alexz didn't even write them. In conclusion, maybe someday Alexz Johnson will go far, but for now, she's stuck in the same teen genre hundreds of other artists have been in, and it looks as if she'll fall through the cracks of pop music just like many a singer before her."
5,Lovin this young canadian!!,"Alexz is an amazing artist. First off I was not too sure what this cd would be like, I only bought it because the song being played on the commercial sounded awesome. lol well lets just say this shot in the dark was a perfect shot!"
5,I LOVE INSTANT STAR!,"I love the show Instant Star. Alexz Johnson is a great singer, and a great actress. ALEXZ ROCKS!She a bit Skye Sweetnam, a pinch of Avril Lavigne, a little Britney and ALL ALEXZ!BUY BUY BUY THIS ALBUM, IT TOTALLY ROCKS!"
5,THIS CD ROCKS!,"now, i watch instant star on The-n but it orginally started in canada on ""CTV"" and now its on The-n and i love the cd! i was going to buy it on ebay for 10.00 but i wnated a new 1 so i got 1 imported from my friend in toronto,ON,CA and we met up and i got the cd for only 30.00 now i gues su could say thats wayy 2 expensive, but when u have money and u want a new 1, than its ok, esspecially since i live in the middle of michigan (Lansing) so it wasnt hard to get to toronto. but anyways, i love all the songs she has and i love every epiosode ever played, and since its form the creators of Degrassi: The Next Generation than u know its gonne be good. i would recemend this cd to anyone who loves the show and the songs on it.. plz DONT DOWNLOAD IT ILLEGALLY, thats way 2 lame, just buy it!"
3,Jessica's review,I think this cd is ok I like some of the songs on here. I love Instant Star so I was glad that I got her cd.
4,A handy product,"If you don't want to be plugging your cell phone into the wall all of the time but would prefer to be able to see its display while working (in my case typing), this desktop charger is wonderful. Another excellent feature is the battery drain: this allows you to take a NiCad or LithIon battery and completely drain it, and then the charger will automatically charge it back up. This is necessary to do at least 2 or 3 times in the life of a Nokia LithIon battery to prolong life."
3,Cliche loops you hear everywhere - nice sound though,"I do like apple loops and have several jam packs. What bothers me is that with Logic pro you get everything in the jam packs, but apple doesn't tell you this, so now I have bought them twice when once would do. Several of the jingles, loops and foleys have been used to death in commercials on TV and radio and you will recognize them instantly, so you have to fold spindle and mutilate them into something new otherwise people will instantly know you did your song on a mac in Garage Band or Logic. There are also some places that openly sell you boots of these jam packs, so watch out."
3,"Nice look, but gets ugly when in use","I'd been looking for something to hold the mail and keys with modern, clean lines (not cutesy, country or oversized like a lot of them) and I thought this would work great. The problem is that it is too small for lots of mail (anything taller than a standard #10 letter, which a lot of bills, etc are these days). It looks good when it's empty but if you actually use it, it gets really messy. There is hard foam inside the top key slot, which holds the keys in place. It is pretty stiff which makes putting the keys in and out a little clunky. I decided to return it."
3,"The manga was better, but...","This is the point where the anime goes in a completly different direction from the manga. It's not entirely bad [...] Also, we finally get indisputalbe proof that Integra is, in fact, female. However, if you have a problem with genderless [...] vampires who really,[...] then from here on out, this show is not for you."
2,"""The center does not hold""","Kariti Mattila is indeed stunning as Amelia Grimaldi. La Scola's bumbling, eager, and erratic Gabriel is thoroughly appropriate for the operatic character (and for the historical one as well). Jacopo Fiesco and Paolo Albiani are both well-played. But Paolo, a mere henchman, dwarfs Carlo Guelfi's Simon. Simon Boccanegra, in the opera as in history, was a forceful and decisive leader. Guelfi's failing voice and hesitant acting reduce the central character to a bewildered and tired old man. The costumes are dull and historically inaccurate."
2,Abbado and Mattila can't save this production,"I have to respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer. I agree that Abbado gives the score of Boccanegra a bit of oomph, something it needs for it to 'sell.' But the principals, excepting Karita Mattila, and the production are bush-league. At times I thought I was watching silent moving acting, or members of the football team acting the annual school play. And the singing is merely serviceable. That includes all the male principals. When Mattila as Amelia appears, though, the stage lights up. That, unfortunately, is not enough to save the whole enterprise. Now, if we could just get Mattila on DVD as Salome!"
4,NOT for the beginner,"I got this bood a few months ago when I was a beginner and it mafe no sense, now it does, it wont teach you the concepts it will tell you how to use them."
5,Impressive,"This is easily one of the best programming books I've ever read! It is extremely useful to anyone who has some experience coding games and wants some great object-oriented design solutions to common problems. It is also a great book for C++ progammers who want to hone their coding skills in this language.In terms of readability, Llopis has one of the best writing styles, explaining concepts very clearly, with adequate examples, and without trying to sound ""too cool"".My favourite sections were those on memory management - I had always wanted to write my own heap and memory pool managers, and Llopis shows you how.Two of the most useful chapters to game programmers are those on object lifetime management and serialization. I personally always found these two topics the most challenging when coding games, and it was refreshing to see different methods of implementing them.Get this book!"
3,Been in the buisness of making games for 12 years,"Going through the contents and skimming through, I'm not sure how this book in any way relates to game programming. It could be a great C++ book, but that's not what the title is about. Some of the things it is suggesting break established paradigms of game developement. It *may* help Windows based game programmers, but it sure doesn't cover any of the myriad of issue sin using C++ on a console such as the PS2, GameCube, etc....It seems like another C++ book. Any thoughts on this?"
4,An interesting account of the Colin Baker years,I really found this book interesting from start to finish. There are the usual behind the scenes explanations and in particular the debacle between Michael Grade and the programme is explored in detail.Personally I found the Colin Baker years some of the most interesting times on Doctor Who. Probably because of when I was growing up I suppose! The stories are described in detail and reviewed by the authors. Revelation of the Daleks (my favourite all time story along with Trial of a Timelord) is chosen for an in-depth analysis.An interview with Nicola Bryant (Peri) is also included relating to her career and how she saw the character.It's a good read if you're into the background of the programme.
3,Key Safe holder,"I replaced my broken key-safe after 25 years of continuous use with this one, but although they look the same, the finish of the crimping inside the key chain is rough and scratches the belt very bad."
2,Too much useless information,"If you are using this as a study guide, go elsewhere. Its close to 600 pages, only about 170-220 should have been used to cover what is on the Proxy Exam. I finally decided to use something besides the Exam Cram books, and do I ever regret it. The author even states at one point, ""you might be asking why you need to know this"". I agree that knowledge is power but save the extra 400 pages for another book about proxy. It is definately a poor study guide. You get so bored with the mounds of useless info that you are a zombie by the time he gets to the good stuff. s"
1,Irritating fluff.....,I've read 10+ MCSE books from Sybex and I liked all but this one. It's got about 300 pages of fluff. I actually had to stop reading several times due to the irritation I felt toward the publisher for wasting so much of my time. Go with Microsoft Press on this one (same content/half the time).
1,Proxy 2 in review,I just finished up the proxy 2 book and took the test. I did pass the test though with little help from the book. I would agree with the majority of comments here that the book fails to get to the point. My impression was that it was mostly mush. I would have serious reservations about purchasing this book!
2,A let down for Sybex,"I have read 5 other Sybex books and passed 5 microsoft exams, but Sybex's Proxy Server guide is a big let down compared to the others. The book does not read well and is not well organized. I found myself re-reading sentences and sometimes whole chapters! I suggest you go with a different publisher for your Proxy study guide."
2,Very Poor. Is written in Circles. Not Structured,"On the moment of starting this book I was not impressed. Out of all the Sybex books that I have read this is absolutely the worst. There are 2 chapters that are identical to the TCP/IP book.There is one and only one good feature of the book and that it the review questions. There were about ten (10) questions that were identical to the Microsoft Exam.My recommendation is to look for another book as I found it very confusing and disorienting. I ended up skipping pages and chapters as I got bored and fed up with it. I was very lucky to pass the final exam.If you want a good book to read, read the TCP/IP book from Sybex (even though it has nothing to do with proxy server). Very well done. It has humorous lines to keep you interested. Something that Proxy Server 2 lacks."
1,Too much,"Sybex at its best: A lot of pages. Those guys think that they have to make thick books so customers will think they get their moneys worth.If you are familiar w/Networking (and you should be if you want to implement the Proxy Server or become an MCSE) then skip the first 100 pages.We all want to pass 70-088 with the least effort. This book is to big for this exam, its far too much reading and blah blah blah. The Author even admits this (see Note on p. 100).Skip it.NC (soon to be MCSE, average of over 900 points on MS tests)"
3,Not as good as other Sybex,"This book was long - in part because it covered a lot of NT information that you should know by the time you're taking an elective exam. For this test, I actually perfered the Exam Cram study guide because it clearly defined the three components of Proxy Server and then expanded on all three and how they fit together, where as this book seemed to devote huge chapters to each component leaving the reader to figure out how everything worked together.Also, some of the sample questions at the end of the chapter were not sample 'exam' questions - they were essay/short answer."
2,Hard to believe....,"After using Sybex's TCP/IP Study Guide, I looked forward to this book, since two of the three authors are the same. What a disappointment. I had to re-read several chapters, because things aren't always placed into a logical order. A fitting description for the text in this book would be ""dry"". It just isn't interesting to read. By the time I was done with this book, I really couldn't visualize what I would be tested on, because the authors focus overly much on irrelevant material, and fail to point out the important information. I passed the exam, but I think it was due mostly to familiarity with the product and the more focused Exam Cram than to this book."
3,The book is good but too wordy!,The book is good but too wordy. The others are right if you already have taken the TCP-IP exam you can skip the first 100 pages. This could have been an excellent book if it's not too wordy and focus on subject properly. Reading this book is like reading a novel and it will put you to sleep. I hope the authors re-write this book like an exam cram type.
4,Good but wordy,"I thought the material was quite good but for someone who was trying to blast throught the MCSE tests, a lot of wordy material gets in the way. If you like reading and detailed explanations, this is a good book but if you have some experience already and are trying to prepare for the exams, it may seem to drag on. Still would recommend to others."
2,Worst Sybex book I've ever encountered,"I purchased this book based on the reviews.... The book wasnot easy to follow and the author spent more time telling you that thetopics would be covered in a later chapter - Never mind the fact thatthe topics were never thouroughly explained. I feel that this bookwas very diorganzied and did not present the material in such a wayfor individuals to understand it. If you are using just this book tostudy for the exam, I highly reccommend that you use other materialsto supplement this book. END"
4,Good product and company,"I purchased mine at Wal-mart on clearance for 50.00 and let me say it worked great, except the digital reader that shows the humidity percentage of the room did not work. I called the company and they were incredible with no automation or holding on the phone! I was very impressed and will buy from this company again.As for the running of the machine, it kicks out a lot of humidity and air, doing a very good job, but there is a bit of noise from it (depending on the level it is set on). There are three levels (1-3), with the 3rd being the loudest. I don't mind the noise on 1 or 2 because it isn't noticeable. A nice feature is the three accuset modes where you can set three different desired humidity percentages and keep them locked in, and change them with the season (or whenever you wish) without needing to manually reset everything again. It is really convenient. The filters are hard to find since this model is out of production but it is a very effective humidifier."
4,Good hold & smell,"American Crew does a pretty good job of holding hair in its place, and smells good by the way. One aspect I didn't like however was the how long it lasted, a couple hours.. Overall, I will probably buy again."
2,Not as good as the reviews say,"The hair gel doesn't smell good at all. It smells like very cheap cologne if you ask me. The hair gel is very oily so you probably don't need to apply much to your hair. I guess the only good thing about this gel is that your hair will not flake. I last boughtShort Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel, Packaging May Vary, 16.9-Ounce Pump Bottlebecause of the higher reviews, and I prefer this gel because it's more harder and dry. If you prefer oily gels, then get this one; it won't dry at all. But if you sweat, then this American Crew gel will definitely go into your eyes. For some reason, this is cheaper than the SHORT SEXY HAIR GEL brand."
4,"Good hold, low price",I bought this because my salon uses the same stuff. CREW seems to be the salon choice of product around my area. Overall it's got a good hold but isn't super heavy. Doesn't seem to leave a flaky residue either (if used in moderation). The color is clear so even if you use slightly too much you can't really tell unlike other products.
4,pmat2,This is the strongest gel I've found so far. Works fine in holding your hair in place all day long.
2,This product is deceiving,"Despite the product's claim that it is firm hold, I do not recommend this product at all. It does not harden into firm hold at all. I even tried using much more than I have used of previous gels I have purchased - same results. It looks like a gel but does nothing."
4,Hair Gel!,"Its great hair gel that smells good, if you like Crew products you will like this one.It does a good job at providing a firm hold, but it does not flake when it is roughed up.The down side is that if you are sweating this product will run into your eyes and burn like nothing else!"
5,Great gel worth every penny,Length:: 1:02 MinsThis gel last a very long time and it's top of the line gel.
5,Best gel ever.,"This gel works great, smell great and last for a long time without making your hair too crunchy.It can be on the pricy side but you can always find great deals on it every now and again on Amazon."
5,Crew Styling gel,I cannot believe I found this product in a 33.8 Oz. size at 1/2 the price I was paying. This is a great product. I've been using this styling gel for years.
2,Too Firm,This product is way too firm for thin hair. Twenty years ago it probably would have worked well on my hair when it was much thicker.
4,Very good and strong Gel.,"Pros: Very good smell, strong hold, less flaky(but still a little flaky)Cons: If you touch your hair too hard it gets messed up, at first the gel doesn't stick, you have to wait till it dries for the full effect.Buy it if you can take a little flakiness and are willing to be patient till it dries. Overall, very good shampoo!"
5,Excellent value!!,Excellent product at a great value. Much more product at a better price than a retail store. Very satisfied. Highly recommend buying online.
5,"Great price, great product!",I refuse to use any other product besides American Crew. I've been using AC products for going on 12 years. The hair gel is the perfect blend of hold and texture. The price simply can not be beat.
4,Firm but a tad sticky,This gel works great for wet or shower dried hair. Leaves your hands a bit sticky but otherwise I'd say I like it overall. Smells good and doesn't flake.
4,"American Crew Firm Hold Styling Gel, 33.8-Ounce Bottle",would have ginen 5 stars but I think it should have come with a pump. I had to buy one separate.
5,Like Poe,"I just wanted readers to know that this writer can write excellent horror in the tradition of Poe - hard core new-gothic writing that will rock your socks off. I was especially impressed by his dark landscapes and incredible and chilling descriptions. My favorite story was ""The Resurrection of James Mason."" This was blood chilling to say the least as the protagonist is trapped in the tomb of an evil master of sorcery on the very night of his resurrection back into our everyday world of strange and weird encounters with spirits of evil."
5,I have never heard of Zakk Wilde,"I have never even heard of Zakk Wilde, but I like Black SabbAth so I might like Zakk. I just wanted to say that my name is Zac and This guy spells his name really weird. Go ahead and buy this album if you want to."
3,"Well, welll....","Well, judging by some of the reviews Zakk turned himself into a kind of Beethoven and wrote a definitive master piece of music.But this is not true. This album is not original AT ALL; it's firmly rooted in country / southern music, and Zakk did not spend any effort trying to hide this fact.I agree that all the songs are listeneable, I really enjoy the whole album. The difference here is Zakk's voice. It improved a lot comparing to the PRIDE & GLORY album. Also, his guitar palying here is sharp and crispy, with a real edge on it."
3,Ummmm.....,"This is not the Zakk Wylde we all know and love. You may think all Zakk plays is the Pantera-influnced Black Label Society and playing lead guitar for Ozzy Osbourne. But no. On this album, Zakk showcases a much softer side, playing acoustic Southern junk. I gave this 3 whole stars because some of the songs on here are actually quite good. But some of them are so boring, it puts me to sleep. I want metal! I feel this is something of a sellout, going acoustic."
3,Zakk unplugged,"The follow-up solo outing for Zakk Wylde since releasing his masterpiece ""Pride & Glory,"" an album which merged the Heavy Metal Power of Ozzy with the Southern rock blues of the Allman Brothers. This time Zakk goes for a stripped down approach, delving deeper into his bluegrass roots. But what the album may lack in flash, Zakk more than makes up for in song writting. Some of the better tunes include ""Way Beyond Empty,"" ""Between Heaven and Hell,"" ""1,000 Miles Away."" Zakk also shows some of his shred power on ""Road Back Home."" Simply amazing!"
5,An artists that should not go unnoticed!!! - ERIC BRASWELL,"I am extatic to see that there are other people out there that listen to Zakk Wylde. He is an awesome guitarist and deserves a lot more credit than he has gotten from the music world. For those fans who haven't heard his first album ""Pride and Glory"", it is a must. It is a more raw sound than ""Book of Shadows"", but it is as soulful and well put together. Thank You for listening and enjoy!!! ALOHA"
5,Zakk Wylde shows his incredible range yet again!,"While Book Of Shadows is a strong departure from his work with Ozzy Osbourne or his recent Black Label Society efforts, it offers a great blend of accoustic guitar, accoustic bass, piano, and Zakk's strong vocals. The songs are surprisingly hook laden, such as in the chorus to ""Road Back Home"". Being a metal fan, I thought this album wouldn't be to my taste in music, but it was excellent. The songs were more vocally oriented than guitar-oriented, but there is plenty of great guitar work to be had. Zakk has made one of the best albums of the 90's, although he hasn't received anywhere near the acclaim that he should. I recommend this album to any fan of music anywhere. Thanks, Zakk."
