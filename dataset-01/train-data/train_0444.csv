5,"WELL, HUH, GENE HACKMAN IS GREAT.",IF YOU WANT PASSION. WATCH THIS MOVIE. HACKMAN'S PASSION FOR GETTING THE BAD GUYS IS REALLY A GREAT TREAT TO WATCH.
1,Mississippi Burning,I bought a used VHS that was in horrible condition I could not hear the movie most of the time and the picture moved up and down continually throughout the movie I did not like the movie it was way to much of a downer the history was good but the movie is really long I wish I did not but this movie it was a waste of my money
3,a racist america!,"A racist America!, August 6, 2004A Kid's ReviewOne can see the supression of the black people from the first scene. The Documentar reports shot the racist scene of the 60's.1. The two FBI men like Dafoe and Hackman tried to disolve the problem in the deep south by hunting the KKK members. Though they failed to disolve the problems...The black men are in misery again2. The two protagonists are white guys and the white guys dominated the roles again,...where are the black heroes in this film?The white guys on again -> the black men are still in misery!3. The complicated problems which happened in the racist deep south, did not sorry anyone in the States, many citizens have just seen the tragedy but did not help them. Black men are in misery again.Could USA be a tolerant State in the future? the answer blows everyone of us."

1,"Shallow, predictable movie","This movie is a great example of what is wrong with Hollywood today. I watched this movie hoping to see an intelligent, controversial film but instead it was the same old politically-correct propaganda.I'm certain that a lot of racism existed in the South in the old days, and that some of the events in the movie were realistic. But what I didn't like was that this movie portrays most southern white people as despicable, illiterate, racist murderers. Yet all of the black people in the movie are depicted as peaceful, church-going, articulate people. I actually had to rewind the tape at several parts of the movie because I couldn't make out what some of the white people in that movie were saying; they sounded so unintelligible.This film basically makes racial issues of the old South seem very clear cut. Good & evil, black & white. Anyone who feels that there are two sides to every issue will find that Mississippi Burning is an insult to their intelligence."
1,Sent Wrong Filter,"I wished I could have written a review for this product. Unfortunately, they sent the wrong filter. My mistake is that I bought it long before the present was due for changing, and did not check the dimensions of the K&N one until I was ready to install it, at which time I found out they sent the wrong one. I guess we should always expect them to make mistakes with shipments and should never take it for granted that they would send the correct product."
5,The Most Haunting and Compelling Melodies To Date,"I stumbled upon this band purely by accident, on an online radio station and was instantly captivated. I have to admit, I immediately tried finding mp3 downloads, to little avail. The songs would not leave my consciousness, and after hearing the songs again on same, had to purchase the CD. These songs are so beautifully done, entrancing your imagination as the instrumentation sweeps you away. I only wish Anna Domino had done more of like nature. This album is a must have for those of you who like the music of Poe, Beth Orton or Portishead. Very, very well done."
1,not very good,it fogged up the first time i used it . not a very good product. would not reccomend to anyone
1,defective,"I love the movie, but it (the DVD) is defective. I didn't bother to return it because it seems too much trouble for the amount of money involved."
1,Sox Fan,"I am a really huge Red Sox fan. I have been for years. I thought is was great and all that they were doing a movie about the Red Sox but this was one of the worst movies ever!! Jimmy Fallon is a horrible actor!! I just wish they could have potrayed Red Sox nation a little better and not have sucked Jason Varitek, Johnny Damon, Trot Nixon, and other into the Hollywood life along with them."
4,Baseball fanaticism at its best,"Fever Pitch provides an amusing insight into obsessive baseball interest. With the Boston Red Sox as a key theme to this film there is a plentiful supply of ups and downs. It is the absorption of the Red Sox as a life anchor that ripples across work and social facets of life, which provides an uproarious baseball movie.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Baseball Author"
3,A real departure....,"This was not a bad film in the least....had a storyline, which I have to say many films this year lacked....The acting was good, concise and very believable...although I have to say that this is a real departure for Jimmy Fallon...he is usually into screwball comedy and in this one he is more, shall I say, human...actually shows that he can play a character that has depth, and something called feelings....what a nice thing to see for a change.One thing that I do not agree with these so-called ""romantic comedies"" is that they are not drop on the floor laughter comedies that they claim to be....sure there were some laughs...but it is not something that would be rented again and again...."
3,Red Sox...sex.....and breathing,"This is a decent date movie. It explores the idea of people initially seeming ""too good to be true"" and the eventual discovery that everyone has their unique hang-ups.Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore are quite good together and make for a good comedic pairing. This is a lighthearted movie that has its funny moments. I also think it's pretty amazing that the movie had to be changed due to the Boston Red Sox actually winning the World Series.The movie was actually being filmed through the process of the Red Sox making their historic comeback against the Yankees. It makes the movie a small part of Boston baseball history."
3,Partial home run.,"Fever Pitch starring Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore almost nails it but this romantic comedy falls short. Fallon's acting stalls while Barrymore just looks bored and confused with her role. This film isn't a disaster, it does have some cute moments but Fever Pitch is forgetable. Only watch this film if you are a die-hard baseball fanatic, otherwise you can skip it."
4,A great movie,Fever Pitch is a great movie. Fallon and Barrymore are sweet and there are funny moments. The best part is that it's not gross out humor ( a Farrelly staple) I really enjoyed Fever Pitch.
2,Rip Off!,This edition may be contains 30 seconds of extra material that I had to watch 3 times to make sure was there! Stick with the original!Go Sox!!!But all that said this is a must have movie ..any version you can get.
5,Lets play ball...,"This movie is awesome if you are a baseball fan, jimmy fallon does a great job in the movie...im a Mets fan by the way"
4,ALMOST A GRAND SLAM,"Having guarded feelings about a Farrelly Brothers film (expecting another gross out comedy), I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by the rather sweet-natured FEVER PITCH. Certainly the performances of Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are largely responsible for the winning nature of the film. Drew is once again remarkably ""cute"" but still a good enough actress to make her character believable and likeable; Fallon uses his comic understatement to convince us he is both a rabid Bosox fan and a young man falling in love. The movie has some nice comic bits and a sense of reality grounded in the stars' alluring comraderie. Only an over the top ending at the World Series mars the credibility but as a movie ploy it works nicely and makes FEVER PITCH at least a three run homer."
5,Hits a Home Run Over the Green Monster.,"Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon did an unbelieveable job in this spectacular adventure to Fenway Park. It is so hilarious.I was in Universal Studios when I saw it and the crowd was in stitches so if you are a fan of the Red Sox this is the perfect movie for you. It was spectacular,unbelieveable,hilarious. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD I will definetley buy it. If you are a Red Sox fan you can not miss this movie. My grade over all (A++++) Fever Pitch is rated PG-13 For crude and sexual humor and some sensuality"
5,great movie,this is so baseball or should i say boston baseball this is how it is here in boston a baseball town
4,Boston + drew Barrymore,If you love Boston and you love drew Barrymore this is a great movie! Really it is in general. Jimmy Fallon is a bit obnoxious but that's how he always is so comes with the territory! I really love watching this movie.
1,PITCH THIS ONE OUT!,"I have enjoyed Drew Barrymore, especially in EVER AFTER. I was looking for a video that had character building traits so I could share it with the children I work with. I was so disappointed in the the DVD that I literally pitched it!"
2,cute,To start off let me just say that I was really dissappointed by jimmy falon in this movie. for as funny as he is on saturday night live youd think they would let him work his magic and get some good laughs out of him but he does not have a single truly funny part in the movie. drew barrymore(sp?) is also very mediocre in this movie. the comedy is at the level of a 5th grader... drew barrymore gets hit in the head by a foul ball while she isnt looking and gets knocked out? HA.. hillarious. maybe if your a red sox fan you could make it through this movie just cuz it brings back memories but if you arent a red sox fan... dont even bother.
1,"Way overrated , even for a Red Sox fan.",It's great to see parts of the Season of film but this movie was not funny or well acted. I was surprised. Something about Mary was very funny.
1,Fever Glitch,"Stupid, dull, and pointless. Jimmy Fallon has a few of his yucks, Drew sleepwalks through an emotionless and senselessscript, and we have to listen to a lot of boring Red Sox triviaand a totally plodding and obvious plotline. Movie redefinescrapola. Sickening."
1,WAS GLUE EXTRA,DVD had sticky substance around center of disc which was unnoticed when loading into machine. It required taking machine apart to remove.
2,Stupid romantic comadey with bad acting,"I found the movie to be just stupid to stupid. Jimmy Fallon's charactor is just stupid and to baby like. If you act like his charactor you need help. Again Dre Berrymore plays the sweet inocent girl. The story line is bad it's stupid, babyish, and predictable. There is the odd few good moments in the film which I found funny. Overall the movie was stupid and foretable."
4,3 and 1/2 stars. A good rent.,"Myself, being a big fan of the Farrelly brothers was looking forward to this and I really enjoyed it. It definitely isn't as good as Dumb and Dumber, Me Myself and Irene or the untouchable comedy masterpiece There's something about Mary, but it still was funny. The movie was a lot more appropriate than the others as it was a sweet movie that had funny but appetizing jokes. The movie is about a man who's completely obsessed with the Red Sox and he basically must choose between the Sox and his one true love. Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore were great for their roles and this movie was funny and at the same time appropriate and doesn't go over the gross meter. A definitely worthy rent."
2,A Weak Pop-Up,You would think that with source material by Nick Hornby and the filmmakers benefitting from the Boston Red Sox being in the pennant race that this would be a more engrossing picture. The film suffers from flat direction by the Farrelly brothers and uninspired performances by Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore. As a baseball fan I was bored with the Red Sox arcana that the film is rife with. Do yourself a favor and seek out the superior British filmization of Hornby's novel concerning a fan of the Arsenal football club. The always good Colin Firth delivers an excellent performance in that version. I'm not even remotely a soccer fan but I was infinitely more engaged by the British version than the American one.
3,LIKE THE MOVIE UNTIL THE END,I WAS WATCHING THE MOVIE AND I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS PRETTY CUTE. IF YOU HAVE EVER DATED A SPORT OBSESSED PERSON YOU COULD TOTALLY RELATE TO THIS MOVIE. THAN I GOT TO THE END OF THE MOVIE...AND IT GAVE ME A VERY SICK FEELING. BROUGHT BACK SOME VERY BAD MEMORIES..OF A VERY HORRIBLE ALCS SERIES. ANYONE THAT IS A NEW YORK FAN YANKEES FAN...JUST MAKE SURE NOT TO WATCH THE ENDING.
3,Haven't I Seen This Already,"Havent' we already seen this type of movie already? Yes, it was called Anger Management. The only difference is that in Fever Pitch, happiness ended at Fenway Park and in Anger Management, happiness ended at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.As a Yankee fan, I'll take Anger Management anyday. I'll never watch the ending of this movie, EVER AGAIN!!!"
4,"nice, fun movie",nice movie and very important review of 2004 Boston Red Sox MLB Championship. this dvd was used but in perfect shape.
4,High in Boston flavor,It is ok for a sentimental purchase I guess..something you feel it'd be good to have especially after the 2004 Red Sox victory coming after 86 years.
4,Divine intervention and the Red Sox win it all!,"Now I'm biased. I am also one of the most pathetic creatures on Earth--a Red Sox fan. Given which, this is a FUN movie! Now, cinematically, it's NOT really a four-star movie. But I think if you like baseball and you're looking for a romantic comedy and you're not an Evil Empire fan, you'll enjoy ""Fever Pitch"". It's funny and sweet--and, oh yeah. The Divine intervention.The Urban Myth goes, they wanted to pick a losing team--that's why they choose the Red Sox. But, by the grace of G-d, the F. Bros. shot this movie in 2004. They originally wrapped up filming in August, 2004. They had to come back, reshoot, and BE there in St. Louis. YES!I also know some Sox didn't want to see it because JF is an NYY fan. Oh, please! Just think how Galling it must have been for him! Obviously, he will sell himself for money! ME, I can't wait for the Boston Red Sox Collector's Edition to come out! The Idiots Rule!"
2,Not as expected.,The movie was great however I was disappointed that I could not easily move this to another media source and still be able to use it. Mostly my fault for not understanding the terms of use but also somewhat misleading product use description. Read closely the types of media it can be watched on. Expect nothing more than media types listed.
3,Back back back .... gone !!!!! homerun !!,"I loved Fever Pitch since I am a big baseball fan!! However, You do not have to be a baseball fan to enjoy Fever Pitch. The acting in this movie was very good!! Jimmy Fallon (the obsessed Red Sox fan) delivers a great performance along with Drew Barrymore.After watching Fever Pitch I had to read the book ""Faithfull"" by Stephen King. It is about the 2004 Red Sox team!!A must see for baseball, comedy, and romance fans!!!"
3,Not nearly as good as the book,"Fun enough to watch, but am I the only one who feels it's sanitized? Everything is all so nice and works out in the end, Red Sox included. Although I haven't seen the 1997 Colin Firth film, I did read the book that both were based on and gave it 5 stars:Fever PitchHave you heard ""If you liked the movie, you'll love the book""? I'm not sure that's true here. Interestingly, this movie was released as ""The Perfect Catch"" overseas. Probably because it is unrecognizable from Nick Hornby's book.The Farrelly Brothers are not Orson Welles, and while this isn't full of potty humor like some of their other movies, nor is it an art house film. You don't need to pay close attention, everything is spelled out for you (sometimes multiple times!). Drew Barrymore knows romantic comedies but I think Jimmy Fallon is more surprising, and impressive. Ultimately it's a chick flick, and I suppose there's not too many of those about sports."
4,Phat Phat Phat,"If you are down with East Coast rap then get this CD! 18 phat tracks by 18 artisits, you can listen to this $#!+ 3 times in a row and still want more!"
3,Good and Bad,"The good is obvious the complete National Geographic Magazine up to whatever year. The National Geographic has many amazing articles and photo spreads and is, or perhaps was, one of the best. A couple of drawbacks however in this CD-Rom collection is the scan resolution. It appears not to have been high enough! My eyes can just plain hurt trying to read some of the issues pages because the words are murky. Then, of course, some of those earlier years weren't that interesting, frankly. The magazine definitely got better as time went on. There is something much more satisfying by actually thumbing through a real magazine and looking at the pictures than trying to do this on CD-Rom. So, if you are aware of some of these drawbacks, but figure this is the only way to complete your collection, then I'd say, ""go for it!"""
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"This has mostly the older style slots with 3 reels and one payline. Has some of the 5 reel games, and they are ok, not great. Lots of video poker variety, if you are into that, which I am not. One disc of the 3 pack needs a codec file download which costs $15, and there is no free or trial version for this codec file, so that disc will not work right. For $[...], this set was not what I was hoping for."
1,Useless to me,"I bought this to install on a Netbook, none of which come with a CD Rom drive. While I was able to map a drive on another computer on my home network and install the games, I discovered that the games would not play without the CD Rom mounted. This was not explained on the Amazon web site, nor on the Reel Deal site. The Reel Deal tech support people just blew me off with no help or sympathy.Now I have games that I cannot use or return."
2,I expected so much more...like quality and durability,"After reading all the kudos on this site and on CNet, I purchased the Canon S900 in early August. Here it is, not even three weeks later, and I'm returning it. The photo print quality was no better than my old Epson (which I bought nearly 3 years ago). Worse, after less than three weeks of use, the printer gives me a message that the printer head is defective and will need to be replaced!! Three weeks?? Yikes, now I had expected more use than that. I think I'll upgrade to a newer Epson."
1,Two strikes you're out!,"Bought this as my first photo printer. Very excited at first with great results. Within a week of minimal personal use the black ink would not print. Cleaning button helped at first (while quickly draining all ink colors) but then could not get black ink to print. Canon help line could not solve...referred me to repair and I got very uncooperative person in White Plains NY. While printer was registered, he said I needed original sales reciept for them to help...I had tossed it. I did like the printer so I just went down and bought another one. First prints were fine (two of them) but by the end of the first day, I encountered the same problem with yellow ink as I had had with black ink on the first one! I think the printer head on this printer is a flawed design and would advise caution. I'm here on line because I am looking for a good printer to replace my 2 Canon S900s! In my opinion the Canon S900 is a lemon."
3,dead,printer lasted about 1 year. paper constantly jamming. unable to replace or repair. need to buy a better quality printer.
2,"Prints nice, when it prints!","The print quality of this machine is nice. When it decides to print it does a great job, if a little slow. It is also seamlessly compatible with both my Mac and PC which is nice.Unfortunately that is where it ends. This printer hates to grab paper, it does not seem to matter whether the tray is full half full or only has a couple of pieces in it...If it wants to print it will print, otherwise it just spins its wheels making a lot of noise and not actually printing.Overall I would say this printer is inferior to any I owned in the 1990s."
3,"Great Photos, But Fading Problem","I have been using this printer for four months and the print quality is excellent. However, I cannot give it 5 stars because the prints begin to fade within a month unless they are placed behind glass or plastic. I find this unacceptable, as I cannot give prints away for people to hang on their refridgerator or office."
5,Does everything Canon says it will do,"We're very pleased with the printer. Photo quality has been excellent and text is fine too. Very fast. I didn't know that the printer would be able to turn itself off after an idle period and back on when needed, and that is a pleasant surprise. No regrets so far after several months of use and our second round of cartridges.I have found that it prints very well, sometimes better, on non-Canon papers, and does fine on Canon papers too."
2,Prints excellent until it breaks down,"Print quality is awesome but broke down just after having for a year - which means I have to pay to have it fixed since it is no longer covered under warranty. In addition, there are only a handful of repair centers, with the closet being clear across town."
1,Not what it is hyped to be,I purchased this printer last week and returned it the day I tried to use it. The print quality is poor and the Canon tech help was unable to attribute the poor quality to anything wrong with the printer or my computer. I had purchased the S 900 to replace my HP 990 cxi; the Canon produced visibly inferior prints with noticeable droplets up the center of the print. I kept the HP and returned the Canon. Think twice before buying-maybe find a store that carries both brands and compare.
1,Don't Buy - Photos FADE quickly,"I bought this printer 15 months ago. Have always loved the printer and the quality of the output, but lately have noticed that ALL of the photos I have printed that are over 6 months old are FADED really BAD! We have sent hundreds of photos to relatives and when we visit their houses we see lots of our faded photos. These were all printed on Canon Photo Paper (PP Pro and PP Plus).We also have an HP Deskjet that is 3 years old. None of those photos (on HP Photo paper) have ever faded. Our old HP printer was ""bordered"". Time to buy a new borderless HP printer and go back to HP paper!"
1,wouldnt recommend even if it free !,Had 3 defective phones in 2 yrs... huge number of dropped calls...wouldnt recommend it to anyone even if its given away free....
1,awful phone,"Piece of trash DO NOT BUY, we got 4 of these and none of them work.. two didn't even work new! (We got these NEW from t-mobile) DO NOT RECOMMEND to ANYONE."
2,Good when it works,The V180 is a piece of trash!! I've had 3 in a 6 month time span. My screen blacks out and I can't see incoming calls or what numbers I've dialed. Great ring tones but horrible reception! People often tell me I sound like I'm in a bubble. I like Motorola but this was their cheap invention that should have stayed on the shelf.
2,Three defective V180s in 10 months,"I selected this phone along with a Cingular plan and have regretted it ever since. I am now on my FOURTH V180 in 10 months. I returned the first due to nonexistant reception. I returned the second due to the fact that it would not always hang up when flipped shut. I returned the third because it randomly froze several times in the middle of the night (always at 3:39am, which was odd); since I use my phone's alarm clock, this was problematic. The fourth time is apparently the charm--this one has been fine. Had Cingular's return policy not been so convenient, this would have been way more annoying. It's still been an inconvenience, however. So learn from my experience, and choose a different phone!!"
2,Not for the hinterlands,"I must live on the edge of Cingular's (and everyone else's) coverage area. This phone can't hold a call at my house, and I have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows several bars strength. Part of the problem is the coverage area, but part is the phone, too. I have friends who have made and received calls from my home with no problem. If you live like I do in a pothole on the Information Superhighway, avoid this phone."
1,Bad Phone!!!,Bad phone- very poor signal- even my head caused signal problems-lot's of other problems too. I changed to a samsung phone- very little problems- don't get this phone even it's FREE!!
1,"The ""Evil West"" Strikes Again!","The Last Samurai is very reminiscent of Braveheart , minus the kilts and good acting. It takes place in the 1860's in Japan at the end of the Tokugawa family era, the last of the Shoguns. The Samurai are in revolt against the Emperor, because they are asked to turn over their swords and culture and accept a modernization (westernization) of Japan.The film portrays the modern Imperial army as evil, while the Samurai are the oppressed good guys. Interestingly enough, the Samurai in history were the elite army and agents of oppression of the Japanese people, while the young Japanese Emperor in 1868, struggled to bring his country up to date with the rest of the modernized world.This may be entertaining for those who like pure visual stimulus without thought. For the rest of us....don't bother."
1,The most ironic film of the year,"Apart from being slow, condescending, cliched and overblown, this film is hilarously, and unintentionally ironic. An American from an American-backed 'peace keeping force' joins with a bunch of reactionary rebels. Amazingly, the rebels are right to despise 'western ways' in their desire to cling to 'traditional' beliefs. Guns, progress and capitalism aren't, apparently, the basis for inner peace. In the face of impossible odds, it's still better to die an honourable death in the face of automatic weapons. So, presumably, the follow up will be something like 'Last Jihad Warrior' where Tom Cruise joins the Iraqi Shi'ite militia in a vainglorious rebellion against Apache attack helicopters."
3,pretty weak,"I dunno, i kinda though the acting was weak and the script was nothing new. They really made up a lot of history for this one. I couldnt help but think Americans would be offended if they made a movie about the revolution and put some Japanese guy in it as the hero. I guess the music was pretty good, and it had some gread scenery, but i wouldn't watch it twice."
2,The Last Samurai,"Bottom line ..... ""Dances with Wolves"" in Japan.And Tom Cruise is just a bad actor period."
1,"Boring Movie, Bad Acting!!!","Not quite sure why all the great ratings for this movie!! It is long, boring, predictable!!Bad acting on Tom Cruise's part and from most of the other actors as well. Too much needless violence---- Yeah, yeah, I get the fact that this is a war movie, but it takes away from the underlying message.Only redeeming feature is costuming and final message of the movie!"
2,Who? Tom Cruise. Who?,"Well. I don't like Tom Cruise. I might actually go so far as to say he is my least favourite person ever. So immediately I was at a loss as to see what he adds to this film. Maybe if the actor was taller. He's so short. It's the quite literal worst film ever. I HATE IT! I HATE IT! I HATE IT! OK. So he goes around karating and samurai-ing. And everyone's like, Oh hell! It's the Cruise man. And I was like, oh HELL, LET'S WATCH SOMETHING ELSE! And Ryder was like, I'm still alive, let's not have a Potter incident. And I was angry with that, so I was like 'RAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHHH!!! DIE!' and I slit him good. He was out of it after that. Fool."
5,Great Movie,It was a movie that captivated my whole family. You felt for the Samurai and his people. There was plenty of action to keep your attention and to me it was not boring.
2,Over long and lacking punch,"Set out wanting to like this but found it over long and very focus on Mr Cruise. Do we really need so many lingering shots of his greatness and the fairly ponderous lines.The film outline is OK and there is a stroy but unless you know nothing of Japan and it's history, some of this film is fairly dull and slow."
4,GREAT MOVIE FOR ONE REASON,"This was a great movie not because of Tom Cruise...but because Ken Watanabe steals the movie. He is fantastic in this film and is an exceptional actor. He makes the movie worth watching. The scene at the end is beautifully played by Watanabe and a tearjerker. If it wasn't for Cruise and his one dimensional acting, this movie could have been superb."
5,A WONDERFUL HISTORICAL FANTASY,"THE LAST SAMURAI doesn't stand up to anything by Kurosawa, but it did prove that Tom Cruise could act, and it is a very watchable film. For one thing, Ken Watanabe, and Koyuki were simply superb, the cinematography, costuming, battle scenes, and music were glorious, and despite the highly fictionalized portrayal of samurai in this period of Japan's history it is a great story, with memorable characters, and one of the most sensual 'dress' sequences ever."
5,Excellent movie,"This movie was an unbelievable epic. The acting was phenomenal, especially from Ken Watanabe, whos acting was quite a surprise as a supporting actor. Cruise was good as always, but Watanabe stole the show.Definitly one of the top movies of the year, if there were no lord of the rings i would choose Samurai as the best of the year."
5,Great addition to your Blu-Ray collection,"This is a must have for any fan of samurai period drama, and now with the advanced Blu-ray tecnology it's even better. As a fan of Japanese culture and history, this film holds up fairly well. Tom Cruise's is somewhat typical for him...a bit over the top, but bearable.There was a nice transition from languages to illustrate his communication with the Japanese samurai. I still would have preferred Cruise learning the language and seeing it almost entirely subtitled, but that's not a viable approach for Hollywood. Nevertheless, the director did a good job of capturing the culture. Even though I tend to be a purist, it's possible to watch this film and be entertained, despite some inaccuracies.This is more a review of the movie itself rather than the disk, sorry! It has some nice extra features and enhancements over the original DVD version."
4,The Last Samurai - Blu-ray,"This is an outstandingly written, directed and acted film with a fascinating subject matter, the Japanese Samurai. The Blu-ray copy is an upgrade from the DVD in sound and picture quality. Bonus Features are excellent. Highly recommend this film."
5,USED DVD'S,I WANT TO THANK THE SELLER FOR SENDING A GOOD PRODUCT WITH NO DAMAGE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS USED. IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO ORDER WITH CONFIDENCE. I WILL USE THIS SELLER AGAIN.THANK YOU AMAZON FOR BEING PICKY ABOUT THE SELLERS THAT YOU ALLOW TO SELL ON YOUR SITE.
2,Tom Cruise,A samurai is an Asian/ Japanese knight. It was a decent action/ adventure flick. Worth renting once or twice. Tom Cruise's fame doesn't do much to heighten the film sceptic's disbelief. I think how good the actors and director can suspend your disbelief that what you are seeing is staged and not real is how to judge a good movie.
4,I liked this movie!,"I guess everything that needs to be said about the actors, the set and the story has been said here, many times over. .My hat is off to the Japanese actors and the costume & set designers. The atmospheric element in this movie is stunning; for example, the first charge of the samurai in that misty forest, is unforgetable. I loved the ninja attack. This is one of the few recent productions in which the masculine is portrayed in a wholesome manner: the warrior spirit, the camaraderie, the honor, and the respect for the inner peace that is brought by zen meditation practice, are brought out very well.While the script was IMO kinda clichey & mediocre, Cruise's acting was not bad and rather subtle for a scientologist :) Zimmer's music was predictably good (if less conspicuous as in, say, Black Hawk Down) and if you're into kendo or swordsmanship, well, you will want to see this film several times."
4,enjoyable and powerful film,"a very enjoyable film with captivating visuals (the filmmakers deserve much credit for filming in actual authentic locations) and powerful, realistic fight scenes.The story does test one's ""believability standards"" a bit, but in a manner akin to Gladiator and so many others. This is Hollywood. Sit back and give yourself to the movie. There is so much here to enjoy."
2,Definately a SHOGUN rip-off,"I haven't read all of the reviews, so I don't know if this has been touched, but this is a total rip-off of the novel Shogun by Clavell. It just happens in a more ""modern"" Japan. Clavell's is in the year 1600, this one is more like 1860 or so.The movie is long, overly long. I'm pretty tired in the evenings and this took about 3 days to watch!The acting is good & the battles and sword fights are great. However, this movie really has nothing to offer as far as originality, tone, or filming. I'm really surprised it was even made."
4,"good movie, bad history","I thought the movie was good, and the japanese were very authentic. But it is impossible for tom cruise to become a samurai, unless the emperor made an ammendment to the laws passed down for centuries, which of course never happened. The movie is good with a plot, but as I said, the producers didn't think of how historically accurate this movie was. The overall movie had a plot and was very well made, and it seems like they put in a lot of time for every scene, just to make you feel immerssed in the culture. Good movie."
5,Cool movie,Is great even though Tom Cruise is in it. Would recommend to anyone who is into the martial arts type movies.
4,Very good movie,"i really like this movieit was very cheapi definitly recomend this tittle to everyone. it's a bit long, but it's worth it"
3,This film could have been so much more...,"I enjoyed the film, and will watch it again.It certainly does have its limitations though... Insufficient character development, under-developed plot, and a fair amount of things that in perspective to the history and culture being treated are just plain silly.This film could have been so much more, but alas it seems the film makers just didn't have it in them to go beyond the ordinary and produce something truly special.The soundtrack was the usual sorry mediocrity put out by Zimmer.. (to cut him some slack, it seems he works too much - how many films does he score in a year?)Ultimate conclusion: Somewhat enjoyable, but nothing more. And frankly with a few offensive elements (which ironically were put in to make it more politically correct...)P.S.Seems to me that certain someones may have been watching some Rurouni Kenshin before making this film... hmmm...."
2,It was ok.... however,"Two points1.It had just a bit too much of a ""Dances with Wolves"" feel to it. I was waiting for a Sioux warrior to wander through one of the shots.2. The young Japanese Emperor was a dead ringer for that special needs kid who played the banjo in the movie Deliverence."
2,Every once in a while...,"I have to watch a Tom Cruise movie so I can remind myself why I don't watch Tom Cruise movies. This is the case in this movie as well. The only sharp blade in this movie is Ken Watanabe, who in my opinion is the only reson to watch this movie."
4,very good,"This is a very entertaining movie. good action, good scenery and good story. Not as good as braveheart, but one of the best of 2003. extras are good"
3,Don't expect too much,"What's the reason for watching The Last Samurai? The sword-fighting scenes. There are a lot of sword-fighting scenes, they're well-done, and if you enjoy watching them you'll find entertainment value in the movie. Also, the Japanese countryside is filmed beautifully here, so if you have an appreciation for nature, it's another incentive to watch.Otherwise, The Last Samurai is nothing special. The storyline is simplistic; the samurai are all two-dimensional and unquestionably the fine and good people in the film. They can do no evil, truly. For Cruise it's one of those self-righteous roles where he gets to look angsty for the camera. There's one scene at the end for example, where he's kneeling and holding up a sword, and he's trying to look like someone who is under great emotional strain and there are these ludicrous close-ups of his sweaty face - really gratuitous. The movie defintely would have benefited from some editing and character development."
2,unoriginal and empty,"basically a rip off of ""dances with wolves,"" but done poorly. very empty when portraying japanese history and culture especially since this issue should have been central and not taken a backseat to tom cruise weilding a sword.on a plus side, its well shot and good visuals. watanabe steals the show, but even he is not enough to save this shallow movie. typical blockbuster movie with no depth.if you are in the mood for an ""independence day type blockbuster action movie"" see this. otherwise, dont waste the time."
4,Best movie that was shot in NZ ever.,"Forget LOTR. You want an epic that actually delivers, this is it. Best use of ninjas in a serious film ever. Great perfomances by both Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe. Ken was robbed at the oscars, heck this whole film was. It should have had several more nominations and taken best picture too. Don'ty miss this one."
4,Very well made movie not sure about the messagge,"Very well made movie not sure about the messagge...I am not a Tom Cruise fan but he did a great job in this movie, I am still not sure if the messagge was anti technology, in that case I would say it is quite shallow."
2,Trite and Been-done-before,"Yes, it's been done before: Add Dances With Wolves to the King and I and what do you get? Well, you would get a LOT MORE than this movie, but generally you get the idea...The acting is generally average, with the exception of the usual Tom Cruise faux intensity, replete with the usual faux intellectual/academic post movie interviews...As for action scenes, the audience get's to watch a slo-mo repeat of one sword-swingning scene presumably to show us how great the fist version would have been had it been properly filmed...and the epic scenes are, well, simply put, NOT EPIC.The lack of love interest is apparent in the apparent lack of interest in the female character by Cruise - no surprise - which leaves the male viewer with little more than some OK aikido, iaido and sushi.The only thing missing was a rice-rocket motorcycle scene. No Top Shogun here."
5,The best!,"Plain and simple if you like action this movie is for you. If you like drama this movie is for you. If you like foriegn this movie is for you. iTs my favorite move, and Tom Cruise is awsome in this movie."
1,"Great movie, but very Disappointing DVD","Wonderful movie, one of the best you'll ever experience and since most reviewers wrote a lot about this movie I won't. The DVD was very disappointing to me because this movie was based on Japan and it's history, however, it doesn't offer you to watch the movie in Japanese or it doesn't even offer the Japanese subtitle!!! They offer the typical, Spanish and French! It would have improved this DVD greatly if they had an option to either watch it in Japanese or to watch it with Japanese subtitle."
2,"Not rating the movie, but the HD-DVD","I like the movie a lot, but this HD-DVD is not so HD. I've played it together with the regular DVD, both from an HD-DVD player, so the regular DVD upsized to 1080i, and there's not any difference. Sorry, but this looks more like they upsized the original DVD than real HDTV. Fox Football looks way better than this DVD. King-Kong, although an awfull movie, shows what HD-DVD is all about."
1,An utter waste of time and money.,"This movie (...) It's no wonder Tom Cruise didn't get Oscar nominated for his role as the obnoxious American captain in this movie. And I'm not surprised at all that the movie didn't get any major nominations during the recent Oscars because this movie is so godawful! I'm really disappointed by this movie which initially had appeared promising. 'The Last Samurai' is simply just another Tom Cruise vehicle whose sole purpose is to get an Academy Award for Best Actor. One piece of advice to Tom Cruise: Go get some acting lessons from Nicole Kidman. In my opinion, Tom Cruise's ambition of winning an Oscar is just a mere wishful thinking because he can't act at all! So, don't spend your money on this horrible movie. Instead, watch a nicer movie, for example Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World."
5,A Favorite,This movie is one of my favorites very entertaining. I wanted a personal copy so that I could turn on the subtitles and be able to follow along during the Japanese dialog.
5,Movie of the Year - The Last Samurai,"By far this is the best movie that I've seen in a long while. Not only does it depict strong issues about honor, trust, integrity, values, sound morals, lodyalt, duty, and respect, but it also shows a deeper sense of love and loving than I've seen ages. Here is a movie full of passionate love, but no blatant sex acts. Yeah!!! That was a wonderful departure from the norm. Ken Watunabe's role was AWESOME!!! This is a great movie."
3,Samurai Dances With Glory,"Ok, I won't go too into detail regarding the similarity with the great epic ""Dances With Wolves"". But I do feel the need to point out some recycled plot points from ""Glory"". Consider: ""War captain put in charge of unskilled soldiers"" This similar plot from ""Samurai"" also comes with the scene borrowed from ""Glory"" (gee, also by the same director .... hmmm) where the Captain (General) needs to prove to others that his soldiers are not ready for intense combat. Suddenly I am not experiencing ""Samurai"" but reliving ""Glory""."
5,Realistic,Could almost be a documentary I am half Japanese and this is a very good movie People should get this movie to learn a little bit about the feudal days of Japan
4,Beautiful movie,"This movie is flawed in a few places, but the beautiful cinematography and zen-inspired imagery more than make up for any shortcomings. This is a better Dances with Wolves, for all intents and purposes. The final hour in particular is breathtakingly well done."
5,Excellent Movie,"Amazing story, great cinematography. For how ling this movie is, it's over way too fast. Amazon streaming does a fantastic job, never had a buffering issue."
1,turmoil,The whole movie is about turmoil. If you like to watch violence and turmoil go for it. I just used fast forward!
2,A major disappointment,"This movie, which I looked forward to seeing, let me down on many different levels. Much has been written about ""Braveheart Visits Japan"" and as much as I hate to admit it, the suggestion fits. I have always enjoyed the spirit of Tom Cruise, but he lets me down in this movie, despite his clear effort to lift it above the action flick genre. It does not inspire. It does not engage. It does not even entertain too well, although the choreography of the fight sequences is very good. I left the theater with the same kind of feeling I have when I observe a good special effects movie - empty - kind of like, uh, Asian food?"
1,A Mindless Glorification and Romanticization of War,"Next to 'Batman Begins' this is truly one over-rated movie!!'The Last Samurai' totally romanticizes war, the samurai code, violence, suicide and killing amoung soldiers. and it has one of the most predictable and cliche endings to any film i've ever seen.skip this one - it is a waste!-CrowTurtle"
3,it was okay,It was an okay Movie!! had a good storyline but i probably wont watch it again it reflexing scenes were really messing up the story.
2,Total Hollywood,"The scenery and set are the best part of the movie, as are the Japanese actors and actresses. The plot is entertaining. Then Tom Cruise comes in and plays, . . . Tom Cruise. He is a looser ex-military drunk who ends up in Japan and teaches this ancient warrior class how to fight. Cruise' ego once again is center screen, the pretty boy who can't act ruins another good movie."
5,Last Samurai DVD,Received in a timely manner and movie was free of defects - came in its original container and was priced well
4,A CUT ABOVE!,Tom Cruise stars in this wildly entertaining prequel to Nick Castle's THE LAST STARFIGHTER. Miss this and you'll be searching for a sword to fall on.
2,The Last Samurai or Tom Cruise's Pathetic Bid for an Oscar,"Three faults of the The Last Samurai (2003):1. Tom Cruise2. The actor who plays the emperor3. The script (esp. the last scene -- horrendous)Three merits:1. Katsumoto2. The beginning of the first battle scene3. Some nice landscape shots (had to pull this one out of a hat)On balance, it is obviously a bad movie."
2,Top Gun with Samuri Swords,"This film started out interesting and good,and then just became ""Top Gun"".While interesting historically,this film lacked everything else,and just followed the basic ""Hollywood"" formula.It was also unrealistic to believe Tom Cruise's character(a troubled,raging alcoholic) could learn the art&skill of a Samuri Worrior in just a few short months of time.The film followed all the basic plot outlines of Top Gun,just like ""Days of Thunder"",and I was rolling my eyes towards the end.It sounds great on a home theater system,but this is'nt one I'd want to buy&keep forever.Buy&own at your own risk,but there are better Jappanese Samuri films out there like ""The Seven Samuri""."
3,The passing of an era,"I've watched Last Samurai in the theater before, and was entertained enough to come back for another look, this time on Blu-ray format. I remembered that it was shot in lush surroundings, and that warriors then were real warriors; not some big-shot general hiding behind some war room somewhere directing ""smart missiles"" etc. On the whole, it's a movie worth having around to please many different types of audiences; action-adventure, some historical basis, some romance & drama (though you do need to excuse a number of cheesy lines particularly towards the end)."
3,"Great movie, clear picture, terrible sound",I bought this DVD on total impulse since i already own it on reg. DVD. I figured this would look really beautiful in HD and i was happy with the quality of the picture. The only think i found lacking in this version is the volume of the sound. I had to crank my TV all the way up just to get some good sound out of it. Perhaps it was an error in the DVD pressing plant or maybe the original soundtrack was mis-recorded...i dont know. Overall this gets 3 stars from me and it would have been 4 stars if the sound wasnt so low.
3,beautiful package. historical inaccruate,"This seems another brave heart movie. The facts are grossly twisted to favor the hero. Come on! If you bother the watch the whole DVD (making of) or something. The guys would tell you it's actually the other way around... meaning the so-called Samurai culture is actually causing Japan more harm than good. Sometime you just have to love hollywood. My main concern is that people go watch this type of overly romanticized junk and believe it is so. Hundred year from now, someone in hollywood will make Adolf Hitler hero movie and I bet people will buy it. ahhh, I give you one thing that I can't deny. It is a beautifully made movie. Too bad it's all fiction."
5,I stayed awake during this movie,"You may think I am joking but Honestly, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I have found so many movies so boring of late that I just doze off during the performance.This movie tells a good story with well paced action scenes. Beautifully photographed and with a very nice music score throughout."
1,Hollywood Trying to make a film about honor? Please,"This film is an absolute load of steamer. I died laughing watching it at the theater, and then again when i saw it on dvd. Tom Cruise, arguably the most over-rated actor in the past 50 years, would have been waxed in the scene where he is taken hostage to start with. the very ethic the movie takes such pains to over-illustrate would have had it no other way. the japanese guys did a decent job, but i couldn't help but think they were just there to cash hollywood checks. It is rather like when American actors come to Japan to do a friggin car commercial. There is no critical fallout, so why bother? Why indeed."
1,Awful,"The Last Samurai is a re-do of the 1990 borefest Dances With Wolves. Once again, a formerly evil American U.S. Army officer comes to the aid of an indigenous people who are threatened by evil predatory U.S. imperialism. At least that is what the filmmakers would like you to believe.Actually, the Japanese samurai were an oppressor class in their own right. The samurai preyed on the peasants. Eventually, as reformers took hold in 19th Century Japan, a new national army based on the peasantry was formed. When the samurai rose in revolt against the reform government and attempted to restore their traditional privileges. the national army defeated them.The Last Samurai fails as both movie and history. Avoid it like the plague."
1,Good movie,"In terms of history, thie movie is a fiction, but it succeed in explaining the main idea of samurai spirit. I like it."
1,NOT TRUE SAMURAI,"This movie was filmed in Australia and not like Japan at all, there is even scene with coconut tree! This movie is Japan from eyes of American, not bushido, NOT TRUE SAMURAI, not the heart of Japan. Japanese emperor and bushido are not heterogenous, this movie mislead of Japan conception. Why ninja attacking village? Was this still playing active part in Japan which became Meiji? -No. The scene when children eat meal without having a rice bowl in left hand, this is very ill mannered in Japanese meal, and this also Samurai's child? -No. To say ""This Hollywood film drew the heart of Japan or samurai correctly"" is profanity to the samurai who fought for the resturation of Japan. --- A rental is enough, I think we see only one time even if we buy it."
2,Good Story; Bad Execution,"Tom Cruise is miscast here. The long battle scenes were gruesome and gratuitous. The story was nearly lost as a result.What we get with modern action/adventure/war films is a sensory assult. They're loud and excessive and overdone in every way. Look at old movies when directors had respect for the audience and the point of the movie was the story. I'm tired of being masturbated upon by these modernists. I'm not seeing any more new movies until I see more of the great old ones. I recently saw Paths of Glory with Kirk Douglas/directed by Stanley Kubrick. Although Kubrick was certainly a bit twisted himself and some of his later films showed it, this early film is a success. I'd recommend it, not this."
3,"""Shogun"" meets ""Dances With Wolves""","Although I don't like Tom Cruise at all, I found this an ok movie. However, I felt strongly reminded of the books mentioned above. Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean."
2,Deja Vu,"There is nothing bad about this movie, except it is extremely predictable, especially if you have seen 'Dances With Wolves'. It is the exact same plot, except set in Japan as opposed to the American frontier. The acting is excellent and the scenery is beautiful, but otherwise I don't see what the big deal is."
4,Fake but good.,"Don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed The Last Samurai, but it's complete bull. This is one of the most unlikely stories ever to be passed off as something realistic. I won't exactly go into detail to spare some from spoilers, but just flat out, this offers a very unrealistic attitude of the samurai from feudal Japan. Last of all, how the hell can Tom Cruise survive all that crap?"
5,Absolutely amazing,"This is one of my favorite movies of all times. I have watched it multiple times over the last couple of years, and always manage to pull something out of it. The Samurai culture is a bit glamorized, and removed from the actual reality of the past. However, Carl Jung once said that a man without myth is as good as dead."
3,"Not an Epic, but could have been","It's an okay movie, but could have been much more. The actors (Tom Cruise, et al) just don't seem to fit the period, and neither does the script."
5,Fantastic DVD!,"I thought ""The Last Samurai,"" was an excellent movie. I plan on keeping this DVD handy. I have little doubt that I will watch this one many, many times."
5,Trivia note,"Wow!! In his opening scene, when Tom Cruise fires his Winchester above the heads of the assembled host, he's shooting a ""Rifleman's Special."" I suspect that only those who grew up watching Chuck Connors will see it, but there it is. A beautiful thing to behold.Meanwhile (speaking of beholding....), this is a first class movie. One of the all too rare ""blockbusters"" that transcends the cliche. The movie quite sensitively depicts both the clash of East and West and their reconciliation whilst ultimately telling the story of the End of Things, the destruction of a Way of Life.It is a one of those very rare not-to-be-missed movies."
3,Not too bad,"I'm not sure what I expected before I saw this, but it was not too bad. When I think of Tom Cruise movies, some of his abominations (Days Of Thunder, et al) come to mind. Some gaijin taught the art of Samurai? Ummm.... never happen - ever. Kind of like Dances with wolves set in Japan. (insert sound of wretching here) One thing I hoped, however, was that it would have the epic feel of Braveheart (or movies along that line). Didn't happen. But again, all said and done, not too bad."
5,Tom Cruise At His Best!!!!,I am not especially a big Tom Cruise fan but this was an EXCEPTIONAL Film. I can see that a lot of time and effort went into the making of this wonderful film. This action packed film keeps you on the edge of your seat and will also tear at your heart. It is a must have for all serious film buffs and dvd collectors. I will watch this film again and again.
4,Very entertaining movie,A great movie that will keep you entertained to the end. I really enjoyed this movie and think it is definitely one worth owning if you enjoy movies like Dances with Wolves.
3,hollywood samurai,"Good American samurai movie, but the ending was totally hollywood. If you want to see a real samurai movie check out Azumi and aragami."
4,Watanabe is a jewel,"Ken Watanabe stole this show. My feelings for Cruise aside, I did enjoy this film though it does bare (story structure-wise) a gross simiarlity to Dances with Wolves. In fact, had the whole story been about Watanabe's character this could have been a better movie--that and we avoid the whole Brave Heart/ The Patriot ending. Overall, you we be entertained."
3,How cool Samurai is!,"When I watch it at first time, I really respected of Samurai. Tom played as captain Algren who is fascinated by Samurai. It was very good film.But, we should not think that is like Japanese history, because the time when film set up and some buildings such as house, castle is different period of Japan."
4,Very helpful for Civ Pro,"This book helps to clarify the dry rules & concepts of Civil Procedure. Much more readable than a boring casebook (although best as a supplement to, not a replacement for, the casebook)."
5,Thank You Professor Freer!,"This greatly clarified civil procedure for me, without it I was hopeless. Combine this book with his Law School Legends CD's on civil procedure, and you'll be set."
3,NICE PERFUME,"I purchased this for my hubbie for v-day...I like the smell not love but like it....It opens with a sharp lemon smell...drys down to a cool refreshing clean scent,,with a light touch of sweetness...a bit too sweet for me...Not a romantic smell to me...but a clean soapy smell...Could be worn by woman too..Good price for the size and scent...But even though I like it not sure that I'd buy it again....looking for a cologne that makes you want to move in close for another smell.... and this just didnt do it for me..."
4,Smells great!,"For the money, this stuff is fantastic! It does seem to go away about half way though the day. Worth the buy!"
4,80's and 90's pop fun,"With the exception of the rhythmic ""Tennessee"" and the spiritually sexy ""Sadness"" by Enigma, this is mostly fun fluff. Great for re-living the pop onehit wonders. I'll admit, it was a guilty pleasure and I'd reccomend it for anyone who likes pop."
4,Great suspense from 2 stories,"OK before anything, unfortunatly Romero's ""Wake Me"" is a waste of time and has a dissapointing end. When the 2nd storie ""The Black Cat"" is way better and really creepy, it starts slow and then builds up tension with twists and turns through out. If this film only contained ""The Black Cat"" I would give it 5 stars. I rented this film out (I live in UK) from my local store and I was pleased. This is worth buying, but rent it first."
3,Dissapointing effort from the leading names in horror!,"Two Poe stories that are'nt linked, one with a greedy wife, who with the help of her doctor, tries to murder her rich, sick husband and the other about a sadistic photographer who murders his girlfriend and walls her up with a black cat. Personally, I liked the second better, but even with Argento directing it is rather dissapointing!"
3,for completists only,I bought this movie only because I am an Argento nut and wanted to have everything he has done. His segment is the only reason I gave this three stars; Romero's segment is a real let-down. I can't even believe it was made by the same guy who made Dawn of the Dead and Martin!
3,Fast foward through the first 40 minutes and you'll love it.,"Two Evil Eyes is an updated addaption of two Edgar Allen Poe stories directed by George Romero and Dario Argento. Romero's half is about 40 minutes long and not worth watching. This is do to Tom Savini's cheezy effects and Romero's lack of heart. He doesn't really want to make this film and it shows. Directed by Dario Argento, the second half of the film is a masterpiece. Argento manages to get an excellent preformance out of Harvey Keitel and some of the greatest special effects of Tom Savini's career. Romero's half is worth sitting through, just to see the unexplainable greatness of Argento's addaption Poe's The Black Cat."
1,A disgrace.,"I'm beginning to wonder if Argento or Romero will ever make another good horror film again. I think it's time to retire, guys."
2,Two Evil Eyes,"Didn't care much for this one despite the stories having potential,the first one being better. A good cast too Harvey Keitel,Adrienne Barbeau and John Amos. It could have been more darker."
2,Boring,It was. I didn't finish it because it was almost entirely shot in that bar with a bunch of drunk talk. How much drunk talk do you need to hear? Seemed like the makers didn't work very hard on the project because they could have featured other scenes and goings on around the bowery.
3,They are ok but not for the price,"I'd rather spend the $ elsewhere. Not very silky material used. Still, it was worth a try! Thank you for reading."
4,Great picture quality on Canon photo paper,"After reading all kinds of the reviews, I decided that this printer will fit my needs for its price. I knew from other reviews that the best result you will only get with Canon photo paper, and that's true (that's why I gave it 4 stars). It prints brilliant photos on Canon Photo paper. You don't have to buy the most expensive one ""Canon Photo Pro"", you can buy a cheaper one, ""Canon Photo Paper Plus"", it's cheaper, affordable and good enough for me. I've also tried printing on some ""cheap"" paper and, as I expected, the result is not very good.I think it's the good printer for its price."
1,Designed to die,"I bought this printer based on its very good reviews. It delivered outstanding prints -- but not for long. The printhead clogs if the printer isn't used regularly. With effort, it can be cleaned. However, what's really wrong with this printer is the printhead electronics. Within a year, the printhead was dead. Diagnostics, various websites, and Canon all concurred that the printhead was dead and a new one for $80 *might* fix it. From the number of posts out there, it seems like this is a common flaw, but Canon refuses to do anything more than sell a new printhead. Unless you're getting one for free, choose a different brand."
1,"Yep, Clogged Printer Head",Same deal as many other reviews. I just found out that my printer head is clogged and it will cost $125 to have it serviced. Thanks Canon. I find this very frustrating since I really like their camera equipment. I guess they don't put in the same time and effort for a quality printer.oh well. Don't buy it.
3,Was a great printer while it lasted,"I had this printer for about three years. It printed great photos for the first 18 months or so. I loved it, and would have given it five stars. Then it started to get a little fuzzy with heads that wouldn't align properly. The pictures then looked bad, and even text wasn't very legible. I eventually got rid of it.If you find one for a low price, snap it up and ride it 'til it dies on you. Don't count on it to last forever, though."
2,Canon S820 bit the dust just after warranty expired,I purchase the Canon S820 (for close to ...[undisclosed dollar amount])when it was first introduced in late March of 2002. Two weeks after the warranty expired...it bit the dust. I had a Canon bubble jet printer prior to purchasing the S820 and had a similar experience.
3,Don't buy an inkjet printer. Go to Costco minilab.,It works well with Canon papers but not HP or Kodak. I heard Epson paper works fine with it but I haven't test it. ...I don't see the future for photo inkjet printer.
2,"Excellent output, short life--beware","I've had this printer for about 18 months and have been very satisfied with the quality of photos. However, the printhead has died, and replacing it will cost me more than the printer originally did. This seems to be a common problem with these printers (see fixyourownprinter.com), and Canon doesn't seem at all apologetic. Making printers that are intended to be thrown away after a year or two is not a responsible corporate practice, so I'm going to be shopping around."
3,It was alright.,I thought that it was good for the most part. It took a while to get to the point and the letter writing was a little much. Other than that it was very sexy and the characters were cold and malicious.
4,Dangerous Liaisons!,"Those who have not see the movie ""Cruel Intentions"", it is worth also reading the book, before you run to the video store. It was the 1782 bestseller novel ""Les Liaisons Dangeruses"" which started it all. Two of most scandalous and controversial people, make a 'bet' on one innocent girls life. The cruel passion, the constant betrayl of these two gifted, wealthy and bored, lead to what could shock your mind. They 'play' with power and only to succseed, even if the innocent must die.Vicomte de Valmont and Marquise de Merteuil (Sebastian And Kathryn, Cruel Intentions) will take you through their letters of pure evil. Will they sucseed, who will win the bet? Read it and find out your self.Deffinately 4 stars"
3,"Pretty Pictures, Lacking Info","I bought this book and really enjoyed the pictures, but I feel that it is lacking in information.Hawaii's Fishes : A Guide for Snorkelers, Divers, and Aquarists (Paperback) is a much better book."
1,This item is for Children,"No where in the description does it say this item is for children. It should. The tools are very tiny and the pink bag is even smaller. I pulled it out and laughed. This item should be called ""Children's Garden Tool Set."" I'm sure this item was returned many times because of the mis-conception given here."
2,It's so-so,"I only bought this because it was on clearance at a Target store, so I knew how big it is. It's cute and hangs by my small indoor potted plants and comes in handy from time to time. The mister broke after a few months, so that was a disappointment as I used that the most often to mist my fern. (I subsequently bought a better mister at Walmart...) IMO this is not for any outdoor planting, but only for potted indoor plants...tools are small and not all that strong for any substantial outdoor jobs. I have to say I would not purchase if not on clearance."
5,Perfect in Every Way,"Can't go wrong with cheerful pink gardening set. I love how this little satchel holds all the small tools needed for my houseplant and herb garden maintenance and miniature landscape and fairy gardens. Clearly not intended for your large backyard gardens, but perfect for the small ones!"
3,traditional latin vibes with hardcore undertones.,heavy grooves and softertextures make this album have a spacious quality.chilipeppers meets control machete' in an alley with bugs bunny watching.
2,disappointing,"Disappointing in overall quality. The watch looks ok,but is basically an overpriced cheap watch."
5,Very Well Made Tool,"This is a very well made pin vise. The handle is big and solid feeling in the hand, but not too big to easily handle. The vise part of it is very well made - It opens up as wide as 1/4 inch, and it closes to practically no gap in the jaws. I am impressed at the quality."
5,Best heavy duty pin vise,"I have a wide range of pin vise tools and when I realized the vise it self was long gone I settled on this because of the .0 to .25"" range. At first I was loath to spend more than $10 for just a stand alone vise but took the chance as it was the only one I found with the size range this one had.Since I have received the vise I wouldnt blink twice at spending more than I did as it is a weighty, well made heavy duty spring loaded precision three jaw vise that will do anything you would need out of a hand tool like this. I used it a lot of my model building tools including saw blades and tiny bits. Construction of this should allow it to last forever! Dont hesitate"
3,"It works, but...",It does what it is suppose to do. That is more than I can say for most micro-drill vises. I just think it could be designed a little lighter. It didn't feel right in my hand wile using.
2,Fabulous until it falls apart....,The kids loved this stroller until one by one the seams broke....won't buy it again.
4,great boy stroller,"I bought this stroller for my 16 month old son. He loved pushing his large stroller around but it was just too big. My only complaint is that the item does not look like the picture. It was only until I checked this site again that it says ""color may vary""-A bit deceiving! It is ok though, still blue."
4,Surprised but it's ok,"The stroller is actually a light blue and white gingham print; not a solid turquoise as the photo suggests. That having been said, it's cute."
4,Good quality but product different then picture,It's basic and good quality. Only slight annoyance is that the pattern that we received is not quite what is pictured. Our pattern is a blue and white checkered pattern.
3,THIS STROLLER DOES NOT FOLD UP,"We ordered this stroller for our son. It arrived folded up but once opened can no longer be re-folded. Big pain for folks with a small Manhattan apartment. I wonder if this is a design defect, or just a problem with this unit -- has anyone else had this problem?"
3,"Baby loved it, but it could pinch her fingers","Although I like the stroller, I could see that my two year old granddaughter could easily pinch her fingers and get hurt on the sharp metal ends that should have been capped off with plastic lids."
4,easy to use light weight stroller,We ordered 2 of the umbrella doll strollers for our preschool because they were blue instead of the typical pink or purple. The kids have thoroughly enjoyed using them with a variety of toys. They are the perfect height and withheld the strain that 28 preschoolers can put on new toys up and to this point. :)
5,Great buy,"We bought this stroller for our two-year-old son, who is obsessed with anything with wheels. He loves pushing it around the house, whether a doll is in it or one of his trucks or trains. It's a durable little stroller that takes our son's racing it around the house in stride. Two-thumbs up.I was surprised when it arrived that the fabric is blue and white gingham, not solid blue, as it appears in the picture, but that's not a deal breaker."
2,Photo is not accurate,Just a warning. The stroller looks nothing like this. It is a blue and white gingham (checked) pattern. It is baby blue not turquise. Quite disappointed.
4,"A nice, manly stroller","Fabulous to be able to find a blue stroller so that my son wouldn't have to push around a pink monstrosity. Everything I found locally was pink.This stroller has been very popular at our house. It was one of the most played with things at my son's second birthday party (by other boys). Of course this typically means random items like blocks or sippy cups are raced around the house in the stroller, versus a small cuddly animal or doll.One star is deducted for durability. A rip developed in the fabric the first day my son used this toy. This was hastened by the tot putting his toddler butt in the seat and trying to push himself around, but it still seems a little flimsy given that it's inevitable that toddlers are going to try sitting in this type of item at some point. Ripping the first time it happens does not seem right to me."
5,Boy Tuff!,I got these for my 2 and 3 year old grandson's to put there Shreck doll in and they love them. They run them into everything and nothing has broken yet.Bruise on Grandma's ankle!LOL If was so great to find ones that were blue and look more like a boy item. I think they need to learn to be good daddy's. They were always fighting over my granddaughter's princess one.Would buy again! Great Price and very cute also!
5,Good toy for the price!,"I didn't have any problems with this stroller at all. I thought it was great for the price. My older sons did, too, as they took turns riding in it against my wishes! It still held up!"
5,My Toddler Boy Loves This!,"My toddler boy loves this stroller. So, glad I bought it. He played with one when he was at other people's homes but my husband wasn't too keen on the girly stuff. I got him a doll that he loves and so I finally got this one when I saw that it was blue. He plays with it everyday. He takes his doll for a walk, feeds the doll in it, gives it a binky, etc. He also puts his favorite trains, cars, books, sippy cups, and snacks in it. Yes, they all get a walk too. It easily folds up but he plays with it too much to even think about it. It rolls well and handles great. Just be sure that your little one is very stable at walking. It will slip out in front of them if they are not stable. He has been great with it but if I would have given it to him to soon he probably would have fallen and I would have thought it to be unsafe. He is able to run and stop. This is a great toy."
3,adorable stroller but poorly designed,"This is an adorable stroller but poorly designed, made. The first stroller I received, the wheel fell off after a week and it wouldn't go back on. That was very helpful and sent a replacement stroller."
3,Cute little stroller,"I bought it for my InSaNe boy when he was 4. He likes to wheel his buzz lightyear and tools around in it lol. Whatever makes him happy:) He, of course, destroyed it with in a couple months. He IS a boy though so... I expected it."
3,"fun, while it lasted.","my wife is a nanny for a pair of twins. she bought it as a gift for her kids. it lasted oh let's see...about a week before the wheel broke off. she said the kids had a blast, but not very durable. you get what you pay for sucka!"
5,"Great toy, great bargain","We've had this stroller for over a year now and it gets used every single day. Our daughter is now 2.5 years and she absolutely loves it. It has held up perfectly. Love that it is not all frilly and pink, it is simple and yet she finds a way to use it for something different all the time."
3,Not the same quality,"I ordered this sheet as a backup for the one that came with the cosleeper and it is thinner and scratchier that the original one. I am very dissapointed and barely use it, unless the other on is dirty and in the wash."
4,Men of Respect,"You know I wasn`t a huge fan of this soundtrack back in the day, but it has some great tunes. ""Men of Respect"" by Kasino and LOX is incredible, you get the ""More Money, More Cash, More Hoes"" remix featuring Memph Bleek and Beanie as well. Truck Turner destroys his tune, along with KRS-One's ""5 Boroughs"" which brings an all-star cast of mc's."
4,Worth Getting if...,"This cd is only worth buying if you like rap and if its $14.99 or less. It only has a few good songs, but the ""Money Cash Hoes"" remix makes up for it. I'd reccomend it."
2,kind of funny,why did they create this movie?i really hate it when mollie (kirste alley)is with albert (george segal).but my faverite parts are when jhon trovolta babysits him.also i like the part when mikey drives a car(using a sitck as a key to turn on the car)!
1,STUPID !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is stupid.So is the second one this movie is the voice of Bruce Willis which in Mikey and Julie the voice of Rosanne in the second one the third one is very good.I have all three of these movies.But Look Who's Talking Too is stupid .I know the third one is better when they get older.
2,the sequels are better,"i really enjoyed look who's talking too and now,and i had never seen this one.then i saw it and thought ""this one was cute,but not funny at all"".see the sequels.and if you like those you might like this.MAYBE.i sure didnt"
3,Talking pheotus. 11th may 2004.,"It starts off quite rude, you can actually see whats happening to the pheotus inside her. It is kind of weird because the baby is talking inside her even though the people don't actually know that he is, and it is daft. It would of been much better if a voice wasen't talking him at such a young age. It is inbetween good and bad, it is one of them films that can't really get better the second time of watching it."
3,Forgot about the language,"The last time I saw this movie, i thought it was cute and thought it would be great for my 4 year old son, now that I am expecting our second. I totally forgot about the bad language. He did like the movie and he really liked the baby talking through out the moive. But the language was not appropriate for young children."
5,Cute Movie,I have seen this movie so many times when I was a kid. I am now having a baby and wanted my 11 year old daughter to see it. She is so into my pregnancy I thought she would get a kick out of this. She loved it!
1,Really should be Zero stars,"This movie fails on every account when it comes to traditional family values, and to me what was supposed to be comical was just plain silly and stupid. The whole movie revolves around a baby produced by a man's adulterous affair with an unmarried woman, and the resulting baby's attempts to find a father. Don't waste your time on this one. Haven't they heard of sanctity of marriage?"
3,Harmless family comedy,"This movie is not about the natural progression of a loving family, from dating to marriage to reproduction. As happens often in life, the origin of the baby was by chance, luck, fate or even mistake. Kirstie Alley is not my first choice for casting a prospective mother. She lacks any of the native motherly warmth or appeal that so many others have. That is the point of the film, perhaps. Here is a work-a-day average woman who just happens to have a date go a certain way, gets into 'trouble' and has a baby result. To be candid, my beloved longlost sister was exactly like the woman in this movie; she cherished the film. As I cherished her, I loved this film..."
4,The Return of Travolta!!!,"Most people give PULP FICTION the title of John Travolta's comeback. During the early to mid 80's, John Travolta was less than an A-List celebrity. The movie LOOK WHO'S TALKING was his comeback to the spotlight. This movie catapulted him back to bigger and better things. He went on to do blockbuster films like PULP FICTION, GET SHORTY, BE COOL, among others.About the movie, it spawned 2 sequels that were great also. And Bruce Willis's delivery was flawless. I can't imagine Mikey sounding any other way. The opening scene of the movie, along with the music, sets the tone for the rest of this raucous comedy. I loved it then and I love it now. Contemporary comedy classic in my opinion."
4,Good comedy BUT CHEAP FULL SCREEN DVD,"I have always liked this film.I had not seen it in years. It still made me laughOf course, they ran it into the ground when they kept making sequels that just did NOT work.My rating is for the film. I am NOT a fan of Travolta's. You see him dancing again & his love of filming were put into the filmGood soundtrack to the film, a couple of Beach Boys songs among them.This is a cheap DVD. Where is the wide screen people? Full screen, that is it. BE CAREFUL WHEN READING PRELOADED INFORMATION ON WEBSITES ABOUT THIS DVD. I HAVE SEEN WHERE THIS DVD SHOWS IT HAS BOTH WIDE & FULL SCREEN. INCORRECT.NO extras at all, no chapter search list.And, of course the other negative. Cheap DVD has 1 of these HORRIBLE plastic DVD cases with the intentional holes in them. HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE & CHEAP. Your DVD can be damaged..If you like the film go ahead & purchase the DVD. But keep in mind all I say above, cheap, NO WIDE SCREEN, extras, & your DVD can be damaged."
1,Same Old Stuff,"500 pages filled with 400 pages of advertisements, and 100 pages of the same old routines with different faces. Flip through 20 pages of ads to find an article. And, most ads look like articles."
5,El Natural,These body builders are exquisite. None of them steroid users are allowed in this magazine... only pure protein power lifters. Just got a lifetime subscription. Someday I will grace the cover.
2,As Mike Mnetzer used tro say;,"""The bodybuilding magazines are just catalogues and offer very little information on scientific bodybuilding.""Take a look at Muscular Development. This is a catalogue for Twin Lab products and you guys complain about Muscle & Fitness?As far as the drug free thing, steriods have been a bodybuilders aide since Sergio Oliva won his first Mr. O. Today, what guys like Sergio took pre-contest, current champions take for maintenance and really load up pre-contest!"
1,Poor Performance,"I ordered this magazine as a gift, and, so far, the first two issues have been sent to me rather than to the intended gift recipient. There must be a better way to handle gift subscriptions. I supplied the address of the gift recipient when I placed this order. The same thing happened last year, and I do not intend to order gifts from Amazon again."
5,Tremendously Entertaining,"Whoever programmed this game did a masterful job. The credits say his name is Forrest Stowe. What other games has this guy done? After playing Casino Quest, I will definitely be on the lookout for more of his work. This is the best and most entertaining gambling simulation I have come across. Great job!"
1,"Bad, poor, dont buy !",Freezes up every few games. Takes too long to switch between games. Is not very fast and soon became boring. Please buy another game. You will be glad you did.I owned this game for less than ten hours and threw it away.Buy something else.
5,Light and very breatheable,"If you are the type of runner that every time your foot strikes the pavement it sounds like you are wearing clown shoes...this could be the best shoe for you. This shoe seems to automatically roll my foot forward without the slapping sound providing me with a more comfortable gait. The shoe is light, the tread holds up great and the breathable mesh allows for excellent air flow. (watch for puddles!) Also some brands seem to put pressure on my joint below my little toe but the sides of this shoe has good support to keep my feet snug but also gives a little when my weight is on the ball of my foot. This shoe has helped my running and my feet and shin muscles are less sore. Its design seems to allow our natural foot shock absorbers work in tandem with the shoe."
4,yeller shooes,THese are excellent. The shoe is comfortable and appears well made and lots of cushion for gout and bursitis sufferers
4,NICE RIDE,THESE SHOES ARE COMFORTABLE AND OFFER A NICE FEEL WITH DECENT STABILITY. PLUS THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.
1,I waste my time and money on this book.,"remember this: Microsoft don't make the best book, and this is one of them. I hate to say, I waste my money buying this book.."
1,A waste of money,"This is not a 'learn-VB' book, basic, intermediate or advanced; nor is it a VB reference. It's just a disjoint series of vague discussions on stuff developers Don't need to get the job done."
2,Poor job of everything !,Its a terrible book for any one who wants to program or find real world examples on any one topic. Even the examples dealt with are so far out that that I will bet that there are a few people who relate. Data Access Options chapter was real dissappointment in that it does touch on the concepts that leave you wanting for more ! Good error handling routines and tips though.
2,Premise more than a bit unlikely,"Okay, I couldn't finish this book, but I felt I might as well say why. I like many of Violet Winspear's books and the writing in this one is good as usual. However, the beginning of the book put me off. The heroine is forced in a way to marry the ""hero"" (he turns out to be pretty nice in the end--okay, okay, I read endings first!) out of some outlandish family loyalty. The hero insists on his marital rights and suddenly the heroine falls for him. Not likely! This book asked way too much of the reader from the beginning. Perhaps it gets better, but I couldn't connect to the heroine who was rather childish at least at first. Maybe if you can stick out the first few chapters..."
5,Excellent Reference for REAL Biblical Questions,"I got this book being a Christian for 20 years, but not really knowing how the Bible answered these questions. Hank puts his God given talent to work in answering these questions with the Biblical answer and just what he thinks. It is refreshing to see this with REAL answers,not just someone else's ideas. I think it would be good for non-Christians to understand the basic principles of what a true Christian really believes.I pray this helps to get more understanding for the Bible."
3,There's Better,This book is ok if your looking for short answers to some of your questions. Although many need to be elaborated on and aren't as cut and dry as he makes them. There are better books out there if you are looking for real answers to hard questions.
4,always be prepared to give an answer,"Well known for his radio show, Hank Hanegraaff (the bible answer man) puts together an easily referenced compilation of frequently asked questions from the many years on radio and from venues around the world. He recommends further resources to compliment this handbook. Each question and answer is fortified with specific scripture passages. Well written, with straight forward answers.This book is to equip us to ""always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks""Wish you wellScott"
1,Inaccurate Information,"I wish I could return this book and its audio book. His information is not biblically based in many cases. In fact, some of his answers are very bias and opinionated, not in line with the adulterated word of God. I am very disappointed.JC"
5,wow...it just keeps getting better,"I love this album -- so much creativity in each song. I keep going back to listen to it several times a week...and I've had the album since it came out! I have the Strokes & white stripes and all that, which I love, but I just keep coming back to this album because of its originality and listen-ability. You can tell Sunfall Festival has come into their own zone --- from the sleepy ;) and entrancing songs of the earlier albums to the ""self-confident but true to soul"" songs on Monday 23. I just can't wait until an album with Trilobite and the other new ones is out!"
1,THIS IS A FAKE!,"Come on people.... a Epiphone Les Paul Zakk Wylde Bullseye is 600, and it's more yellow...etc, etc... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GUITAR! I have reported this seller to amazon!See this video for more info on Fake Epiphones: [...]"
4,Needs better velcro?,"I'm quite happy with it. I mounted the pulley to a cleat on the wall a little bit above the back of my easy chair. This allows me to sit in the chair, reach behind me, pull the collar down into position, velcro it in place and let it stretch my neck at various angles, simply by leaning the easy chair farther back or farther up. I had to reposition the main velcro strap on the back of the collar and I still have some difficulty with the collar velcro letting loose. However, this may be intentionally designed so as to reduce the risk of injury from too hard a pull. All in all, I'm quite happy."
4,Supine C-TRAX Cervical Traction Unit with Srandard Halter,"This contraption works pretty well.I have degenerative disks & when hanging upside-down doesn't help, this is the most economical thing to use.Of course it's not near as helpful as the one the physical therapist uses, but I don't have $600 lying around.The therapist also told me how much water to use & for how long."
1,Faulty DO NOT BUY,I have viewed the replacement item sent - at additional cost- after the original item stopped playing after approximately 1 hour and 13 minutes - only to find that this replacement item had exactly the same fault.
3,"It was good, but not outstanding!","I know that the satire was in the book, but I did not like it because it was overblown. This took out a lot of the sence of danger that Connery and Caine faced in their adventure. Caine steels the show for most of the movie, until the second half, then Connery comes alive."
2,BORING.....,"I found the movie to be totally boring and a total waste of my time.........It picks up a little bit toward the end but that's about it. The heavy English accent, made it almost impossible to follow."
5,KIPLING+CONNERY+CAINE=PERFECTION,"By a stroke of genuis and a bit of serendipity, John Huston managed to get hold of the only two actors in the world who can portray lovable rogues Peachy and Dan in Michael Caine and Sean Connery. Both obviously relish their roles here, and their spontaneous chemistry works perfectly. Like Rudyard Kipling's short story, the film is sheer delight from start to finish!"
3,One of the best films but one of worst DVDs,Rates 5 stars for film.Rates 1 star for DVD quality. Read technical information section. It says it all.BTW this this is a filper that losses data when fliped.
5,On of the best movies ever filmed.,"A great Ruyard Kippling's novel interpretation for the screen. Great director, actors and script. This version has a few enhancements that make it great for hometheater."
1,Failed,This DVD failed after 1 hour and went to a black-and-white review of Elizabeth Taylor and Humphrey Bogart movies! Missed the last half of the movie. Not good enough.
5,The Man Who Would Be KIng,This has long been my fav just a great story. Great acting by 2 of the consumate actors of their time
5,A great film,I don;t think that there could have been no other actors other than connery and caine that could have pulled this film off. For anyone who is studing the craft. This is how it is done. this was great acting of a great adaptation of a great piece of work. a classic that will last forever.
3,A Fipper! Why? On The 2010 Edition No Less,"I ordered this wonderful movie because it is simply a wonderful movie. 5 stars for the movie. But whose brainiac idea was to make it a flipper? I knew it was likely since I read what others had said. Still I thought perhaps that was the older one. Surely the 2010 edition wouldn't be like that. Wrong!! Wrong!! The movie could easily have fit on one side. It only runs 129 minutes. Still someone thought of splitting the movie into to halves. It is very odd, to be sure. Here's another odd one. The extras - such as they are, are found on both sides. The next to the last scene with Connery falling to his death has been oddly cut. It looks like he falls only 15-20 feet. However, I remember seeing this years ago and Connery falls, his body limp as it pluments deep into the canyon. Why was this cut, is a mystery. However, this really is a really good movie.Just don't get to hung up on the weird things that are mentioned here and by others."
3,Wonderful film but strange DVD layout,"First, this is a wonderful adventure film based on a Kipling story. What I can't understand is why the makers of this DVD put half the film and the special features on Side A and the second half of the film on Side B. If they had put the whole film on one side and the special features on the other, I would have given it 5 stars. As it is, the break just ruins the continuity of the adventure."
4,Great,"This movie was a bit off the path--not exactly the type of movie you might be expecting...but that's what makes it so good. I won't put any spoilers in, but this is perhaps one of my favorite movies. The acting is good, the plot is good, and the end is a bit of a surpriseI strongly recommend it"
5,This is one of the best movies that no one has heard of,"I have watched this movie at least 10 times since I saw it in the theaterIf you like movies like Indiana Jones, you will like this movie."
1,The Second Half Was Good,"I was already a fan of this movie when I bought it so I recommend the film, but not this DVD. The copy I was sent only had the second half of the movie available to watch. I was very disappointed and because I did not watch this right away I couldn't return it. I will say make sure if you buy movies from here watch them as soon as you get them to make sure they work. This is the first time I had an issue with anything from this website."
1,DVD didn't work,"The dvd had no start screen. When we tried to watch it, the movie stopped halfway through and wouldn't play anymore. Then it went to the main screen and the Scenes section of the dvd stopped at that scene. Very disappointed."
1,One Star For The DVD!!!,"Great movie. Unfortunately, you have to FLIP OVER THE DVD half-way through the film. LAME!!!!"
2,so so,nice scenes - very capturing - but boring movie - i wouldn't recommend it. Beginning was very interesting but degraded quickly.
3,"Great Movie, dead average DVD","I love this movie, but I was disappointed by the quality of the transfer of this particular DVD.Unfortunately, it seems to be the only one available. Watching on an LCD HDTV, the picture was grainy and ridden with artifacts.If you're going to watch this film on a standard definition TV set, you'll probably be pleased, as the definition of such a set probably won't reveal most of these mastering defects.If you have an HD or Blu Ray DVD player, the upscaling may get you some improvement."
4,buyer beware,"So far, Amazon lists this as having an aspect ratio of 1.77:1. The film was originally shot in 2.35 ratio, so if it's released in 1.77, DON'T BUY IT, because it means it has been ""reformatted to fit your screen,"" that is, the new version of pan-and-scan hack jobs. Let's hope this is an incorrect aspect ratio listing."
1,A Great Movie Mistreated,"This is a review of the DVD only, not the movie itself, which is one of the all-time greats, in my opinion. I don't normally collect DVDs, but I bought this one because The Man Who Would Be King is my favorite movie. What a disappointment that in 2010 anyone would simply re-issue an archaic ""flipper"" disc. Not only that, but it is highly edited and the video quality is mediocre at best (I realize allowances must be made for a 35 year old movie, but still, it should be better than this). If you wish to purchase this movie, I would HIGHLY recommend that you pre-order the blu-ray disc. If you need to watch it now, rent it. Don't waste your money on this poor quality DVD."
5,Good film,"Great products with extreme profissionalism of international shipping. This makes me feel content and wanting to do more business with the amazon family. Concerning the movie itself, I usually buy what I already know I'm gonna get, thanks to the amazing review system of Amazon's and to the often illustrated custumers that buy fine things at Amazon and leave their useful tips. Thank you all!"
5,Regal Chemistry...A Peachy Movie,"This is my all time favorite movie. Mix in two great actors, add British imperialism with a dash of human greed and you end up with a recipe for an outstanding, humorous adventure story with a tragic ending.It doesn't get any better than this. If you have to buy one DVD, this is it."
4,Classic Rudyard Kipling protrayed by a classic cast,"Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer directed by John Huston. . . It doesn't get much better than this! The movie is an old fashioned adventure tale centering around two ex-British army pals trying to make (or steal) their fortune in India. Sean Connery's character is mistaken for a returning god by a tribe in the remote mountains of Kafiristan. Unfortunatley, the character starts to believe that he just might be destined to rule. Trivia buffs should pay close attention to the native girl who is the object of Sean Connery's affection. She is Shakira Caine, a former beauty queen and Michael Caine's real life wife at the time this movie was made."
5,"""Honor"" and loyalty as tragic flaws.","If you haven't seen this movie, get it today. It is a terrific film.It can't be classified as either a guy or ""chick"" flick, because it is too good to be either.Great story, but above all, it has fantastic characters.I'm not a fan of either Michael Caine nor Sean Connery, but their acting, their characters make the movie. (Don't let the fact that one of them is nicknamed ""Peachy"" make the movie suspect.) They are charismatic, charming, warriors persuing dishonorable goals while steadfastly convinced they personify nobility and honor (soldiers of fortune, determined to ravage and plunder, to separate ""undeserving savages"" from their treasures).There is a lot to like, and a lot to take away from this movie."
1,Unwatchable Melange,An unwatchable melange of nonsense tending toward farce without meaning. Maybe of some use as as a travelogue. Essentially a waste of talent marked by boredom without end. Stay away unless you enjoy mindless slapstick and humorless fantasy.
1,A FIVE STAR CLASSIC on a 1 STAR DVD,"This was one of my favorites, and a ""must have"" in my DVD library. The story is still great,and the dialog between ""Peachy"" and ""Daniel"" is still among my favorites still.But the DVD was dissappointing. The movie is split on two sides, and has to be flipped to view the remainder of the film.The DVD only has Dolby 1.0 Sound (Digital but MONO)and apparently very weak in the mix. Overall a better picture than my old worn VHS, but very weak audio overall.The menu's and commentary are hard to read, and there were points in the movie where the transfer to DVD looked ""jumpy"".More than disappointing presentation overall.This deserves a ""director's cut"", or an audio remix to serve those of us who will cherish whatever copy we have, forever."
5,"A cracking movie, bold, impressive and unusual...","This wonderful movie, unlike any other (Zulu was good but this is in a different class althogether). Great visuals, stunning scenes, beautiful cinematography, a compelling script & story and the some of the very best actors (particularly Connery & Caine) at their best. This is not formula Hollywood dross. Nice finishing scene too. Highly recommended."
5,"Great Story, Even Greater Movie","Set in late 19th century British India, this movie is based on the Rudyard Kipling story of the same title. I read the story after learning that it was written in a somewhat similar style and voice to that of the fantasy novel, ""Timbuktu Chronicles: Aida and the Chosen Soldier."" The movie, ""The Man Who Would be King,"" was almost exactly similar to the Kipling story, and word for word in many places. This is one of the best movies ever made, and definitely the best Michael Caine or Sean Connery movie I've ever seen. The story is breathtaking and makes me want to actually visit the Marwar Junction in India. Great movie. Hopefully a movie based on ""Timbuktu Chronicles"" may also be made."
4,Marvelous and tragic Kipling romp/moral tale,"Sean Connery and Michael Caine are beautifully cast in this old-timey adventure movie, set in remote Kafiristan. They play a pair of rogues in the grand tradition of epic movies in this satire of British Imperialism. It's very, very funny, and also very sad: a tale that proves the old adage Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. What begins as a romp ends as a tragedy."
2,WHAT IS THE ENDING?,"The first side of the DVD worked perfectly fine. I tried to watch the second part of the movie on the other side of the DVD, but to no avail. The picture ""froze"" after four minutes of viewing the movie. I tried viewing the DVD on the other two DVD players in my home, but once again, the picture froze during the same scene. I asked two different friends to try the DVD on their players, just to be certain I was not having technical problems in my home. Both friends were unable to view the movie in its entirety. What is the ending of the story? I enjoyed watching the first part of the movie and would very much appreciate being able to view the entire movie, as would my friends. I am curious about the ending to the movie, therefore extremely disappointed in my DVD purchase."
1,couldn't stand it,"The streaming was absolutely horrible as is most of amaz's streaming. and to think they charged me for it, then refunded my money then recharged me again. terrible, horrible, worse streaming in the world it seems. The movie is a great movie if you can put it together and stream it with out it stopping every two minutes."
2,the man who would be king,"I was very disappointed with this movie. It only went to chapter 21 and then I got all kinds of garbage, Humphrey bogart and all kinds of nonsense flashing on. I am not a happy Camper."
4,Connery Classic,"You won't find a better or more entertaining movie than this one...that is, if you like Sean Connery (much as he was in the Great Train Robbery) and Rudyard Kipling's special prose and prowess as a teller of tales. The DVD is disappointing only in the scene that was omitted...the one, near the end. Alas for such an omission.Still...an excellent addition to the collection. Good viewing on a rainy Saturday afternoon or a snowy winter weekend!"
2,A great movie ruined,"This is a Flipper Disc! I hate flipper discs! The movie is only 2 hours and 9 minutes long, yet they split it up on both sides of the dvd. And this seems to be the only version available. This great movie is way overdo for an overhaul."
3,Issues with quality of DVD transfer,"My experience deals with the quality of this DVD.I love the movie. Not too politically correct, but enjoyable, nevertheless.But, the widescreen movie has to be flipped over half way through to see the last part of the movie. I just sold my laser disk player, and have NEVER had to flip a DVD.The least enjoyable feature of this film is a grainy, almost pixelated appearance. The colors are not rich and looks like the movie was filmed on grainy film. I assume the transfer to a digital format was done with poor compression, or else the producers transferred from a very old copy of the film.Unless you really want this DVD, wait and hope for a new version."
3,movie-classic/dvd-a joke,"i remember seeing this movie in washington,D.C when i was a kid. i will never forget how amazing it was. now you can't find a good version of this film anywhere. now there is blu-ray..no ""man who would be king"". same old tired dvd with poor sound quality and weak visuals. please bring it back to the movie theatre or put it on blu-ray..thank you."
5,The Raj and The Craft,"You can't get any better than this: Director-John Huston, from the nvoella by Rudyard Kipling. Starring Sean Connery and Michael Caine, with support from Christopher Plummer, Shakira Caine, and the gifted Saheed Jaffrey! Take that talent and set a ripping adventure yarn in the British Raj. Throw in a good soundtrack and passable location shots from Morocco and the Alps.Could it get better? It does. A great Masonic theme from Kipling, who was himself a Mason and loved the craft as much as he loved the Raj and his cigars! Now spice it up with a clever script and wonderful chemistry between the stars.Forget The Jewel in the Crown, Gunga Din, The Four Feathers, and even A Passage to India. This is the best film set in 19th century India.The plot? Well, go buy the film and watch it! Let's say that Kipling's own words from The Ballad of the East and West ring true. And as for this movie, if we may paraphrase Rudyard, ""A woman is only a woman, but if she marries a god, she smokes!"""
5,Best Movie Ever!,Amazing Movie in a Beautiful Country! From some one who has seen this Majestic place in real life; Must see!
5,Great,Our family is huge Sean Connery fans. This movie is a classic and a great addition to our home media library!
4,Love the Movie,I love the movie and it was great to find it...This would have been a 5 had I not needed to flip the DVD to finish the movie from the reverse side.
4,Great Movie with a good moral message,This well known tale is wonderfully acted and well directed. The story is interesting with a good message at the end. Well worth the watching!
5,Someone stole this from me and I was not upset because it meant someone has a great movie,"This movie is a Sean Connery, Michael Caine, John Huston masterpiece.A great movie for a child that reads and wants to see the British Empire from the British point of view with soaring vistas and strange peoples when the dragons still occupied the unknown spots on the map.There is much there for adults in that it is a masterpiece movie, created with meticulous by a master with no lame special effects.What one of these movies should be."
5,The Man Who Would Be King,"A superb movie , Well written and photographed . Two Great Actors!Larry De Witt,Allen,Texas"
5,Excellent. Rousing Entertainment,"Let me start out by saying that the guy that gave this film one star because he had to turn the ""flawed"" dvd over in the middle of the film should familiarize himself with DVD production standards. It is within the medium's specifications to have a two-sided disc. Now that that's out of the way, this film is great. Even at the time of its release people were saying ""They don't make them like this anymore!"" I guess that speaks for itself. A brilliant adaptation of the Kipling book. And Sean Connery and Michael Caine are their characters. You don't see them as actors. Kudos to them for an exceptional job."
5,Incredible,This movie is simply one of the best films with some of the greatest characters in any movie with one of the greatest stories and scripts of any movie ever.
4,Good cd,The package arrived to me on time. The only problem was that there is a crack on the case of the case. Other than that the CD plays wonderfully and has tons of good songs on it. Glad I bought it!
4,pretty good condition,"The movie got here a day early which was cool, the case was fine the disc has some marks but nothing serious and when watching it plays almost whole movie except for one little hick-up during the comedy club scene"
4,Cheech And Chong's Next Movie,This movie was funny. The Comedies of today are not interesting to me. Comedies of old were better than today's by far.
1,C&C's Next Movie is Edited Down!,"If you have seen this movie before, please note that the cartoon scenes at the begining and end are gone, as well as the UFO Diamond Girl scenes, as well as changes in music score! This is not the full movie, and I would wait for a new re-release of the movie (this time with all the scenes!)"
4,Wacky Tobacy Version,"There are two version of this movie out there. One has Cheech's cousin carrying around a bag of wacky tobaky and the other a bag full of diamonds. Glad I got the non-diamond version.The DVD received is not new as stated on Amazon. It's basically a repackaged dvd. I overlooked this because I received the version I wanted, as stated above."
2,Half as good as UIS,"This flick has a few good laughs, but largely falls on its face. BUT... if you smoke enough dope it'll seem like a 5 star comedy, but if you smoke that much dope you may have trouble finding the 'PLAY' button on your VCR."
5,The coolest Cheech & Chong movie ever!,It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and it is also the coolest one of them all.
4,"Still waiting for an ""Collector's Edition""","This is C&C's funniest film ever. ""Up In Smoke"" is really good and establishes the duo's place in the cinema, but 'Next Movie' is just plain awesome.I was planning to buy this dvd, and still intend to do so, but was a little disappointed that they did not include any footage of the deleted or alternate scenes. Those of you who saw the 'diamonds version' on comedy central years ago know what I mean. There were some extra or extended made-for-tv scenes that really filled the movie out nicely...not like this is an epic picture like Gone With The Wind, War and Peace or Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.Still in all, this one is a purchase."
3,The C&C fun machine rolls on!,"Follow-up films or sequels almost always fall flat. This movie is a hoot, possibly funnier that its predecessor. There are subplots in this movie that add to the humor without demanding viewer attention.Cheech has a double role as first cousin, Red, who speaks unaccented English. This is an inside joke: Cheech, real name Richard, had to be taught his trademark Chicano accent. Prior to hitting it big on the concert circuit, he spoke very much like Red.I only wish I had bumped into hippies like Tommy Chong, a simple, uncomplicated, singular-minded pothead. You can trust this guy, whose main ambitions were jamming, friendship, and seeking the ultimate high.Again,C&C; come off as likeable, empathetic souls. I couldn't wait for their next flick. This is a high-quality DVD transfer of a gut-busting funny movie."
3,"Not a bad ""stand alone"" adventure","When you look at the film on its own rights, and without comparing it to TGON, then you have a fun, well-written World War II partisan/sabatoge adventure.AS someone who saw it at the age of 14, flush from Star Wars mania, and a big Harrsion Ford fan, I was impressed. Recently I caught it on AMC and found that it held up reasonably well. I had forgotten a lot of the good plot twists in the script.And on a really personal note, as I said, having seen it as a fourteen year old male at the time, Barbara Bach's bathing scene was the first ""skin"" I ever saw in a movie. Which was really something for a PG film back then. It is truly sad, how far things have come. I am now a teacher, and I just cringe when I know that about 90% of my sixth-graders have seen films like ""American Pie"" and ""The Matrix!"""
3,a return to WWII,"If you treat this as a seperate, non related entity to the GUNS OF NAVARONE, then you will enjoy it a lot. It is a WWII action story & it has a lot of great action & story developments. I only wish they hadn't used any of the Naverone name or characters (played with obvious inferiority to the original).http://sonnyboo.tripod.com"
3,Not as bad as the critics think,"I think this movie has gotten a bad rap from Hollywood critics. I've always kind of enjoyed it, even with it's storyline glitches, and believe me I am very picky about WWII movies. OK, totally believable it's not, but if you're looking for an exciting adventure movie this might be your thing. It is interesting to note that this is one of the earlier movies to portray the hotbed of Balkan politics that we all know today. I first saw this film when I was still young and in school and it inspired me to read up on the Balkans, it's Partisans, Chetniks, Croats, and Serbs. Strange as it sounds, I actually had a better understanding of Balkan politics when Yugoslavia splintered in the early 90's thanks in small part to this film. Don't sell the movie short until you have seen it."
4,Good War Movie,"I don't know why Leonard Maltin doesn't like this one. I thought it was pretty good. Tired of men-blown-to-bits Vietnam stories? Try this one. The sequel to Guns of Navarone, Harrison Ford and Robert Shaw act well as a unit commander and a spunky ol' veteran officer. Ford leads Force 10 on a mission to execute an undercover spy and Shaw and his buddy (whose name escapes me) tag along with their own mission to blow up a bridge at a strategic spot crucial to the allies success. Both forces end up helping each other do their jobs after some tension at first. The movie also contained a few plot twists and you're never really sure who's on who's side until after all's said and done. Carl Weathers (Rocky movies) makes an earlier appearance as well."
3,Exciting,I saw this movie once before and wanted to see it again. My father was in world war I in France (1914)in demolition and it seems he did such things. It helped to see it. It certainly was exciting. Kay
5,One of the best WWII movies of our time!,"No scratch that, one of the best movies ever! I first saw this movie on AMC and i usually don't care for older movies but this one just blew me away. If you don't like this movie, something is seriously wrong with you. It has an extremely good plot and not too much violence. I definetely recommend you to buy this movie if you like WWII movies!"
5,5 STAR - EXCELLENT MOVIE,EXCELLENT MOVIE - 5 STAR.EVERYBODY MUST SEE ITI ENJOYD VERY MUCH FROM THE MOVIEHIGHLY RECOMMENDABLEROBERT SHOW AND HARRISON FORD
3,Solid WWII Escapism,"Though Carl Foreman wrote the screen story, ""Force 10 From Navarone"" (1978) has little connection to Alistair MacLean's ""The Guns of Navarone."" It doesn't matter. 007 veteran Guy Hamilton directs this action-filled World War II adventure with efficiency and humor. Robert Shaw and Edward Fox take over the Gregory Peck and David Niven roles in memorable fashion - ably supported by co-stars Harrison Ford, Carl Weathers and Barbara Bach. Composer Ron Goodwin (""Where Eagles Dare"") provides a typically rousing score. ""Force 10 From Navarone"" received a bad rap from critics, yet holds up nicely when seen today. The double-sided DVD features the superior 125-minute European version in widescreen format."
5,Awesome war movie,Must be one of the best war movies of all time. I can watch this movie over and over again. Also one of the finer films of the sixties.
5,great movie,I have seen the movie before and I wanted it for my collection. The movie is great and the hummer in it is great.
5,Better than I remember --- and I remember it being good!,"Awsome cast, great locations and a crackin' story! This is very much a worth while purchase. The movie has never looked better. The blu ray print is far superior to previous dvd releases."
5,Fantastic Movie,"I love this film and my wife, who doesn't like war movies, thought this one was great. I would recomend this to anyone."
2,"Not worthy of the name "" Navarone""","An extremely poor follow up of the original "" Guns of Navarone"", the simplistic plot and fiented realism of this film knock the points off. Although not entirely horrible ( The appearences of Robert Shaw and Harrison Ford) this film could have been much better. A good adventure film for those who are either too lazy or mentally-challenged to follow a good intricate, well thought out plot, such as in "" The Guns of Navarone."""
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!,"This movie has the worst picture of any DVD I have purchased. The frame jiggles and the picture itself looks as if it was mastered from a video source; i.e., the picture is blurry and the colors run together. The dialogue and stunts are laughable!This DVD was so bad that I returned it for a refund."
3,"Great movie, poor mastering job.","I think this is a terrific action/adventure film. It's NOT to be compared with ""The Guns of Navarone"", because they are not related and the former is actually a masterpiece... this film is just doggone good fun to watch.I give this a lower rating however, because on my brand new copy of the DVD, I could not remove the French subtitles on my brand new Panasonic DVD player at all. Not sure why it was impossible, but it was distracting and coupled with the poor transfer, I give this a ""3"" reluctantly."
1,Great Book but Lousy Movie,"I read MacLean's book that was a marvelous piece of work, then watched this movie, understanding that it would probably not hold a candle to the book. This movie is so far off track of the story line of the book that it should have a different title. It was obviously low budget with most of their money going for Robert Shaw and Ford but they completely wrote out the most colorful character in the book..Andreas Stavros, Anthony Quinn's character in the Guns of Navarone. I have never seen a worse adaptation of a book into film. Don't waste your time on the movie, the book can be purchased cheaply on the net and is a mighty fine read for adventure junkies."
3,Fun enough to be entertaining,"There was no reason to declare this a sequel to ""Guns of Navarone."" There was no reason even to have the word ""Navarone"" in the title, since the movie goes nowhere near the location of the first movie.The story is ludicrous (of course), the special effects cheesy (the oh so phoney-looking flood that destroys the bridge), a post-Star Wars Harrison Ford barely registers as a character and Carl Weathers plays Apollo Creed again, this time in Army green. Most of the other actors are pretty good, Robert Shaw and Edward Fox especially, and Barbara Bach looks luscious (and as a bonus, she gets about as naked as you can get in a PG-rated movie).In short, this movie is clearly inferior to the original ""Navarone"" as well as other MacLean-inspired movies like ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""Ice Station Zebra."" Inferior doesn't mean bad, but it's still the worst movie that I've ever seen more than 5 times."
3,Edward Fox makes the movie.,Why this guy wasn't allowed to play this character in other things is beyond me. He's the ultimate british eccentric who absolutely delightful :) The only other role that comes close is his part in A Bridge Too Far. Good WW2 Action movie.
3,"Fair story, great stars.",This is before H Ford became Han Solo and includes Robert Shaw a long under-rated screen presence. The story was slow moving so I could give it no more than 3 stars to in spite for these 2 stars being in it.
1,One of the worst sequels ever,"Having just seen the excellent ""The Guns Of Navarone"" I saw this the day after. Why did it have to be so bad? The actors are good actors (Harrison Ford, Robert Shaw & Edward Fox), the director Guy Hamilton (Goldfinger) is also quite good, but boy oh boy - they certainly don't show it in this movie."
4,Force 10 From Navarone...A Pleasant Surprise!!,"FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE is most notable for its diverse and international cast from the late Robert Shaw (JAWS, THE STING), Harrison Ford (need we list his films), Edward Fox, Carl Weathers (ROCKY I,II,III,IV), Barbra Bach (THE SPY WHO LOVED ME), Richard Kiel (THE LONGEST YARD), and Franco Nero (DIE HARD II). A British and American Commando Force are dispatched to destroy a bridge in Nazi occupied Yugoslavia with a side mission to kill a double agent. Not exactly a sequel to the classic Gregory Peck film. Supposedly two of the characters are lifted from the the original story (based on a Allister Maclean novel) and Navarone is miles away in this movie. However, the characters are engaging, distinct, and have good rapport. The film has pretty good war time action, dialogue, tense moments and a couple of surprises. Overall very entertaining war movie for its period."
5,Exceptional Movie,"If you like WWII movies, you have to see this movie ! It is an exceptional movie with an all star cast !"
4,force 10 uncut is not for my kids,I love this movie. I have seen it many times on television but when I rented it I was suprised to see that this rated PG movie had full frontal female nudity. I was lucky that I wasn't watching it with my kids. I really don't understand how a pg movie can have this but its there. Just a warning in case any parents are considering it for a family war movie like I was. After all war is a good family history lesson.
5,Pactical Instructions on the Optimal Use of these Exercises,"Moshe Feldenkrais, renaissance man, scientist, educator, wrote this book regretably in a manner more suitable for his science students. However, to be able to profit the most from these 10 fundamental Awareness Through Movement lessons is to read them out loud and transfer them to an audio-tape while your favourite relaxing music is playing in the background. Then follow these instructions - in your own voice - while being gentle with your body. Be ready to switch off your recorder after each part of an exercise and relax for 18 breaths (= 1 minute)-- or better take consideration of this fact when originally dictating the lessons to your recorder. Permit yourself to fall asleep if you feel you need to do so. Remember that your neurological system needs to be trained to accept these deeply regenerative movements and it may take some time until you feel comfortable moving in a slow and fluid manner. Gábor, Feldenkrais Movement Educator."
1,a waste of time and money,"i have been interested in learning about the feldenkrais method for some time. after seeing all the five star reviews for this book i thought that it would be a great introduction to the method. boy was i wrong. this is NOT a book for people who have very little or no knowledge of the feldenkrais method. i found it to be complex, technical, wordy, and in many cases more complicated than it needed to be. there are almost no pictures accompaning the text, and the few pictures that exist are of wooden manequins. don't be fooled by the glowing reviews written by people are who are practicioners of the method. if you are like me and just want a book to introduce you to the concepts then this is not the book."
4,The Largest Presentation of M. Feldrenkrais' ATM Exercises,"This book was published after Moshe Feldrenkrais' death and is essentially a compilation of select exercises from different seminars that Moshe held over a long period of years. As a general presentation of Moshe's life-work this is not the best text ... when I was new to Awareness Through Movement I was frustrated after reading this book because I had so many unanswered questions about what each individual exercise was designed to lead me to see. But now adays there a number of good general books out there ( ""Relaxercise"" or Hanna's ""Somatics"" ). And after working through what they offer you'll appreciate the real point of this book which provides exercises that can deepen your insight into areas that you've already begun to touch"
4,Great Theory,"I loved this book and have read the first part over and over again.But if you want more than theory and want to learn some exercises of the method, this book might not be the best way to do it.As another reviewer states, the text is complicated and the wooden mannequin photos a true mystery.If you want to know more about the method, I would suggest buying this book for the theory and also get ""Feldenkrais: The Busy Person's Guide to Easier Movement"" by Frank Wildman for the exercises."
3,A Must Have,"For the average American, body awareness is pretty slim. Increasing our understanding of the daily habits our movements make upon our bodies (and upon our social culture) would do a lot of good. This is a great starter for those in physically active professions who perhaps need a new resource or reference. I highly recommend it for all dancers over the age of 14."
2,not 'simple' exercises,"These 'simple' exercises, are actually long, detailed, written diatribes, that one can't actually do as they involve remembering the long, detailed instructions in your head while being on the floor in one pose or another."
3,Good,"I have oly skimmed over the book and have not read it yet, but I'm sure there's a lot of good information in it."
3,Dolphins Was Good.,But not great. When I buy an Imax DVD my expectation are high. Dolphins was good but not 5 star. To give Dolphins the same or better rating than the The Living Sea DVD is not accurate in my opinon. The story starts off well but it seems to lag from the meddle on. The Living Sea is a DVD you can watch time and time again. I do not feel that way about Dolphins. So rent and watch a nice film.
5,Stunning Cinematograpy and Natural Beauty,"I loved this on the big screen and still do in my home. Nature is captured in stunning beauty and the tropical paradise comes to life. I recommend this as a natural escape for those wet and cold city blues. For nature lovers, you might try a wonderful underwater adventure in ""IMAX- The Living Sea"" or try my favorite natural getaway! Bring a book or simply do nothing as you relax on white sand beaches, listen to lapping waves, and watch gorgeous sunsets in ""Hawaiian Dreams: WAVES Virtual Vacations."""
3,Unable to Play Both Discs on DVD,"While this production is well done and fun to watch, one of the discs is not playable on DVD. It can only be played on a PC. This information should have been shared with the consumer prior to purchase. Didn't understand why this wasn't explained in the marketing description. Disappointed I didn't know this ahead of time. I expected a 2 disc edition both playable on DVD. Consumer should have this information prior to purchase."
3,"I agree, its a cool phone and all......","I had my phone for a while, until unfortunatly put it in the washing machine with my clothing. i am not saying its a bad phone for not living through a washing machine, i didnt expect it tooi loved the size, weight, feel of my L2, it is a really cool phone.BUT, what always happened to me, since the phone is ""internet capable"", a feature i dont care to use, the phone buttons would accidentaly be pushed at times and its little internet screen would load up,by the time you have a chance to react and hang up, data has already been sent and recieved, you get charged by the amount of data that the phone recieves if you dont have a plan for it, which a lot of you will not get (a guess). so my cell phone bills would be 48 and 54 dollers when they are supposed to be 39.99. and for sending and recieving 0 text messages, thats a pretty high mark up.i would recomend the phone, its very cool, but buyers, be ready to have unneccisary fees tacked onto your monthy bill"
1,Execrable...unless you're a drummer,"Admirers of drum technique will find lots to listen in awe at in these two albums. Billy Cobham is a technician almost without peer.That said, as musical and artistic ventures both these albums are ultimate failures, and represent some of the worst of late 1970's fusion. I can only laugh when I hear Kamal singing ""Early Libra"" - it is pseudo-spiritual dross, no doubt written in good faith, but so maudlin as to beggar belief. Hallmark Card sentiments dressed in orchestral excess.These albums have dated very, very badly. The only reason I hold onto this double album set is to teach me a lesson about bad taste.If you are looking for the definitive Billy Cobham album, buy ""Spectrum"", and leave this one for the trainspotters and drum geeks !"
5,What can you say about swiss army knives?,Swiss army knives are simply one of the best pen knives around! I ended up shopping price and this was the best I could find.
3,smaller than expected,I was disappointed with the size of the knife. It seems smaller and less durable than previous Swiss Army Knives I have owned.
4,Good Pocket Knife,"This is a good general use pocket knife. It comes very sharp and keeps a nice edge. The only ""CON"" is the handle is the typical red Victorinox plastic, the model from the 1980's had an aluminum handle. However this is still a good knife for a good price."
4,Great CD! Great Songs!!! Great Choir!!!,"This CD is for anyone who likes to hear chiors singing Traditional Gospel music. It's great! They sing songs that you can actually sing in church! There's no Rap, no extra remixed beats, no loud guitar solos.... It's a GREAT CD. No matter where you're from or what generation you're a part of, you'll enjoy this one!!!"
5,Powerful and optimistic,"I don't know why more middle-aged white people like me don't listen to the Gospel Music Workshop. So much of white rock n' roll music comes from here. There has been a rich cross pollination through the years, I suppose, but white owes black more than black does white. Though it is the white man's recording studio. Anyway, it's hard to think of any music more exciting, it's brimmng with physical electricity. This is really the message. You don't really listen for the words, all the creativity is in the music and all the power is in the performance. This isn't a form of religious art that will inspire remorse of conscience, is anything that occurs in a mega-church going to lead to deep reflection? No. But there's a place for happiness, optimism and joy in life, your body and soul need it, and this is one of the few places you will find it. You have to listen to ""My Father's House"", one of the greatest songs ever written."
3,The Cover is a Bit Misleading,"This is a decent History Channel show on the EARLY days of BMW - really through their break into the US market with the 2002. The DVD covers the founding of BMW, their wartime aircraft background, and the development of their car lines from the beginning of the century to 1976. While the picture on the cover shows a very modern BMW, you won't get anything on any models or history after about 1976 - so be aware when buying that your M3, M5, Z roadster or whatever modern Bimmer you drive won't be on there..."
5,"Incomparable, deathless cover art for a deathless anthology","I first read October Country in October of 1962 and have never parted with my yellowing original copy. No Bradbury book -- novel or short story anthology-- has ever better encapsulated this remarkably individual talent, one of our greatest ""artful naif"" story-tellers, and the original cover art provided with this edition seems, even after all these many years, to fit the stories contained inside with a unique and preternatural appositeness. It's one of the great book covers of all time."
5,"""October"" must mean there's a chill in the air.....","From American's greatest living science-fiction writer, these tales of the human spirit showcase Ray Bradbury's versatility in every literary genre.You'll love the pure joy of his storytelling as much as the irony and dramatic threads woven in each of these expertly-told tales.Long live Ray Bradbury, and may the verse be with you.Erin MedlicottFort Lee, NJ"
4,Ray Bradbury,Anyone who is a fan of fiction should read this book- it is incredible! You won't want to put it down!
4,"Not Bradbury's Best, but still has some good work in it.","Not all the stories clicked with me, but there was some that I thought superb. I found ""The Skeleton"" hilarious, but since I'm not sure it was suppose to be funny I think it's an indecation of my twisted nature. ""The Small Assassin"" was my favorite, since it was both scary and revealing."
2,Not the cover/ edition pictured,"I picked this version of the book on amazon and ordered from this seller because I wanted the edition in the image (it was a gift and the image has some significance). I received a much larger, bulk edition of the book with a different image on the cover."
2,"A Brooding, Slow Paced, Film","This is one vampire film you may have trouble getting interested in unless you are a huge fan of slow paced, brooding, gothic fare. The premise is not incredibly new. An ancient vampire finds a lookalike of his long lost love and proceeds to pursue her. Through twists and turns that seem to plod on forever we eventually come to the inevitable conclusion of the movie . . . and how many ""happily ever afters"" have there been in vampire films? Not your usual fare and incredibly slow paced, the film is interesting but you probably could only sit through it once . . . with the benefit of the fast forward button if you're an impatient viewer."
4,BRAVO!,Great acting and directing make this tragic movie absorbing.This viewer definitely recommends this to any Julian Sands fan and purveyor of vampire fare.
3,Does not work well with XP,"I have had this scanner for several years and it worked very well and does a nice job of scanning.Any buyers should be warned that it will NOT work with XP with the included drivers. Even with new drivers, the scanner only works marginally often requiring a reboot of scanner and/or computer to scan a second document."
3,Help. Software is crippling...,"I significantly deducted the Canoscan because of its software. I want to scan a set of photos, but the Canoscan's software pack is making the process difficult. The manual says to start with Adobe and import the photos with the scanner -- this makes it impossible to use Adobe Photoshop(to save or adjust previously scanned photos). This means while scanning you can only wait. With other scanners I was able to save/crop/adjust color while scanning the next photo. With this one you have to actually exit the scanner program before you can use the 'save' function in Photoshop.Does anyone know a work-around? What am I doing wrong?I'm returning this and getting an HP -- which I know from experiencs allows me to be at least twice as fast scanning photos."
3,Poor Picture Quality,"I owned this scanner for 2 days before sending back. I found the quality of photo scans was not very good. They were too dark, and slightly blurry. I was replacing a 5 year old HP scanner and compared several 600x600dpi scans of the same photos from both scanners, and I liked the HP scans significantly better. I was looking for the USB 2.0 to speed up the scans and get a higher resolution, but it looks like I will have to wait a little longer."
2,Going back tomorrow,"After UMAX left me orphaned (no driver support for windows XP for my model) am forgetting the cheap models and sticking with namebrand. Tried Epson 1250 and 1650 Photo, just bought the Canon 1250U2F. The worst scan quality of the 3. Lack of crisp detail when compaired same pictures from other scanners to the original. The Epson 1650 clearly the best. Returned it primarilly to check out Canon - same brand as my printer, but the Epson also had software issues. Since the return, Epson has released the 1660 which added USB 2.0 and apparently resolved some of the software issues as few reviews note software problems. Interesting review on the Epson 1660 vs Epson 2400 - not worth the price premium as the 1660 excels."
3,Quality Problem,"Agree with the review titled ""Poor Picture Quality"". The scanned photos look dark and VERY blurry. I scanned the same photo with this scanner and CanonScan N1220U, the picture gotten from the later is MUCH clearer (but on the other hand, the later scans slower and louder). I had to return it (not bought from Amazon).The bright side is that the softwares are easy to install in my Win-2000 machine."
1,Handed a lemon,"I purchased this scanner as a christmas gift for my wife, and decided as soon as I got it to try it out in my office. From the moment I took it out the box and tried it out I was disappointed. Everything scanned came out blue. Amzazon advised that I had to deal with the manufacturers to sort out the problem.The manufacturer's customer service department response so far seem helpful, certainly alot more than [company name]!I am glad I tried it before Christmas."
3,Wasn't completely impressed,"This is to be a gift for a novice computer user. I was a little disappointed in the performance of the scanner, it takes too long to scan photo's and documents. The Adobe photo software seems more complicated then other software that I've used in the past, however since its a gift I was only verifying that things worked."
1,WTF?! No Mac support...?!,The features of this scanner are amazing for the price. I was sold and ready to purchase until I saw that it doesn't support Macintosh. Truly asinine on Canon's part.
4,Great Deal!,"This is an incredibly easy to use package. I use Windows XP Home Edition. The scanner was up and running with all programs installed within a half hour. I have scanned photos AND negatives with no problem and what I consider to be excellent results. The ONLY reason I didn't rate a ""5"" star was the negative slide holder should be a little sturdier and should lock in place somehow. I don't like how it slides on the glass when you are lining it up. It hasn't scratched the glass yet. It seems like this could happen with a lot of use, however. You'd be hard pressed to get a better scanner with the same quality/ features and software in this price range!"
2,A most disliked character,"Even though Munoz Molina makes the reader want to read his short novel without wanting to stop, this reader enjoyed reading it for the whole purpose of disliking the male protagonist more and more as the plot went on. Mario is a weakling, a man who is so afraid of losing Blanca, his wife, that he will not be himself. There are times when he seems to want to quit this masochistic relationship, and face losing his wife in order to be himself and live his real life, but he never does it. The one redeeming moment when he would tell his spoiled, purposeless, drug-alcohol-sex addicted wife to walk out the door, never comes to the dismay of this reader and those other readers who have to put up with two of the most pitiful characters in contemporary Spanish narrative."
5,beer can chicken holder,I bought four of these since it was buy three get one free and they are fantastic...the price was so cheap I figured the quality would not be the greatest but I was so wrong..they were better quality than the original one that I paid a fortune for..so was very pleased...had beer can chicken on the grill when we had company and they worked great and washed up easily...couldn't be happier with this product and recommended it to all my friends who also ordered this product..you can't go wrong with this product!!
4,Yummy chicken,"Makes my hubby like chicken and he even cooks it. Two hours at 350 with a soda can = tasty chicken! Don't like cleaning it, but it's not too bad. I have bought these for friends!"
3,OK rating,"Product is what my title indicates, it's an OK product. Nothing more nothing less. It will do the job but probably a little high in price for the quality you get. Not so bad if buying 1 or 2, but we purchased several and then it makes a difference."
3,AMAZON SHIPPING TOO SLOW,"In purchasing this item one should be aware that Amazon may delay shipping and delivery for as much as two months.Order Date: November 15, 2009Shipping estimate: December 17, 2009 - [B] January 4, 2010 [/B]Ridiculous!The paid shipping option originally put the estimated DELIVERY date at 17 Dec.The so-called super-saver shipping could delay delivery an additional month ...or more because sometimes Amazon does not honor estimated dates.I bought these (2 of them) expecting to be able to give them as gifts for Christmas *this* year and I cannot understand how an * "" in-Stock "" * item can take OVER four(4) weeks to ship at this time of year.Did they do this because it was one of the 4-for-3 items? Who knows ..."
1,the transfer was so bad i still can't tell if this was any good,"i have recieved 3(count them three) disc of this movie and after 5 min. each one freeses up,even on machines of other people. avoid this disc like the plague!!!! skip it!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The Guess Who - Greatest Hits,"The Guess Who - Greatest HitsI was looking forward to receiveing this tape. I have enjoyed the Guess Who for many a year. When the CD came the case was cracked and the disc did not look damaged. HOWEVER, after playing the CD it skips so it was damaged,. I did not send it back because it takes more time to get it re=pkged and taken to the post office. I am not really happy that the tape case was cracked and I don't mean just a little cracked. It was like someone stepped on it."
3,"Cracked case had to open early to inspect the prouduct, as it was to be a gift!","Large crack all the way across the front of case easy to see, I had to open before x-mas to see if the cd was ok before I could give these as a gift at christmas time, and the cd was ok, The case had a large crack across the front and this was done before it was shipped to me because shipping box and packaging was in perfect condition. Two cd cases of the four cds I had ordered had large cracks across the front that had to be opened before they could be given as gifts to inspect the cds! The Guess Who and The Monkeys."
2,"""Aren't Worth The Paper They're Printed On!"" Burton quote","I'm afraid that I will always overlook this CD, because it's another attempt by RCA to keep this great band in the ranks of obscurity. I am disturbed by the fact that most of the Guess Who Albums have not been released on CD in the USA, and that albums like Flavours and Road Food have been forgotten. I'm tired of compilations by the Guess Who, they may give us the great singles, but there were even greater album cuts that are ignored on these ""hits"" compilations, and I want to hear them as they appeared on the album. My advice is: forget the album compilations, buy a record turntable, then go to a used record dealer and buy the original albums on vinyl, transfer them to tape, and burn them onto a recordable CD. That's the only way we're going to hear the missing Guess Who Albums on CD, or just sit back and hear the albums in the way that they were originally presented to us. Never been anything wrong with that."
3,guess whoi,"The CD was great, I really enjoy ir. This was meant to be a Christmas gift for a friend of mine. However, the case was cracked, so I could not give as a gift. I kept the CD. Not sure I will buy any CDs on line anymore."
3,Guess Who's Playing?,"Well, sorry Guess Who's fans but let's face it. The band never had an identity. I mean, you could never tell (for sure), which band was behind the song you were listen to. American Woman, maybe their greatest hit, is dated already and so is These Eyes. On the other hand, I was listening to the radio the other day when I heard Clap For The Wolfman and I said wow! Who's this? What a great song! But still, I didn't have a clue. See my point fellows? There's no signature on their songs. Still worth having this compilation. Needless to say more."
1,Bubble gum [stuff],"Where the heck did ""Amecican Woman"" come from? That early-70s tune is an amazing mix of Canadian surf-grunge, and bears little resemblence to any other song on this disc. The rest of the songs are lightweight, at best. Sappy, cheesy, amateur AM-radio sounding stuff.Do yourself a favor: If you're buying this disc because you love American Woman, and haven't heard anything else by the Guess Who, SKIP IT!! Find some compilation or soundtrack that has the song on it (there have to be a few). They will inevitably be better than this thing."
4,"Nice package, great song list, but ...","One of my favorite bands from my youth. Cummings had one of the best voices of the era.But... they really needed to find a way somehow to squeeze Pain Train and Running Back to Saskatoon in here.Moose Jaw saw a few, Moosomin tooRunnin' back to SaskatoonRed Deer, Terrace and a Medicine HatSing another prairie tuneSing another prairie tune"
3,pretty good remake///,i love these great old songs and they sound good...but the intensity varies from song to song. It's nice to hear these again...
5,BRILLIANT ALL THE WAY,"This is the best greatest hit's collection so far from the guess who , these songs are pure classics you can't beat'em , A+++++++++++ , highly recommended."
3,Call it a definitive Greatest Hits Guess Who collection!,"Not bad! it's what you call a good and okay compilation disc of The Guess Who's own every hitmakers of their best favorite classics they have here songs from the brief mid sixties and seventies tunes like ""These Eyes"", ""American Woman"" and ""Undun"" with many more included!"
5,Guess Who Greatest Hits,"This CD is a tease since I had all of their music on vinyls, and you just can't replicate nor replace that.It is however, great! If I had to replace all the vinyls,8 tracks, and cassettes I would go broke.I am not doing blue ray, so I'll just download YouTube when they change to the next format. Justone woman's opinion, not that you asked."
3,Be careful,"My daughter loves reading the Puppy Patrol books, but about half the time they end up making her cry and ruining her day. She's a very sensitive kid, so they may not have this effect on everyone, but I question the sad themes that frequently run through them. ""Red Alert"" is particularly tough.That being said, she's a big fan of these books and can't wait to read the next one. The happy books seem to offset the sad ones for her."
4,My son loves this book,"My two and a half year old son loves this book. We took it out of the library and read it over and over, so I am buying us our own copy. He is fascinated by the she-wolf, and loves to recognize the word ROME when Romulus names the city. I teach high school Latin, so I love clear beginner books about myth and history that I can share with my son. This book is written in 2-3 page chapters, and is appealing pictorially to my young son but would be a great addition to a family library with kids through 7 years old or so."
4,Ringu... a good example,"Ringu is a good example to use for any argument on why the US shouldn't remake foreign movies. After watching Ringu, I was left wondering why they didn't play this movie in American theaters as compared to the numerous theaters that The Ring was played in. Big budget and CGI effects are all well and good... but even though The Ring was scary... Ringu was much more so!"
3,I wish there was a place,I wish there was a place where this movie can't find me. I saw the original Ring and was slightly frightened. Then I saw this and suddenly I'm not scared anymore.
4,"HIDEO NAKATA, OPUS 3","***1/2 1998. Directed by Hideo Nakata, RINGU is an adaptation of Kji Suzuki'sRing. Here's the movie that began the whole Ring serie, Japanese and American. An urban legend turns out to be true when the niece of a journalist dies of terror seven days after having seen a strange video tape. With simple special effects and no blood, Hideo Nakata manages to create a disturbing atmosphere. Recommended."
2,"mildly creepy, not scary","As a fan of Japanese cinema, I really wanted to enjoy this movie, especially since I'd read that it is much better then the American remake (which I haven't seen). Unfortunately, Ringu starts off nicely, but runs out of steam by the end of the film. There are a couple of genuinely creepy moments, but nothing approaching ""scary"". If you want to see good Japanese horror, try ""Ichi the Killer"", or if gore isn't your thing, the stark eerieness of ""Onibaba"" is much more unsettling than anything offered by Ringu."
4,Much better than the remake,"Hollywood seems to have lost the ability to make a decent horror flick in recent years. Japan, however, does an exceptional job of turning out high-quality, moody horror. Ringu is a perfect example of this. Subdued and moody, Ringu is one of the spookiest movies I've seen in years. Seeing the buzz generated by it and its sequels, Hollywood decided it could do a better job, bought the rights, and threw out a hack version of a truly enjoyable film. Ringu works because of its subtlety and atmosphere. While some may be turned off by the supernatural/psychic aspects, they work within the scope of the movie. Both Ringu and The Ring made my skin crawl, but for much different reasons--Ringu, because it worked so well, and The Ring because it didn't. The DVD is barebones, but the movie and chills are worth the price."
4,Very scary!,"Although the American remake was a little eerier, the original is still great. Based on the novel of the same name, the ghost of a powerful esper haunts all those who see her cryptic videotape and vows to kill them within seven days. Hoping to break the curse, a nosy reporter soon puts her whole family in jeopardy after her ex-husband and her son also are exposed to it. They have to find away to save themselves before the week is up, although just laying the ghost to rest might not stop the curse! RINGU will leave you with a sense of forboding doom, and you'll never leave the lights on when you go to bed again!"
2,A disgrace to japanese cinema,"I bought a bootleg copy of this film a long time ago before it was available here because people said it was the scariest movie ever made. I love Japanese movies so I thought it would be great. But it doesn't have the same flavor as other Japanese movies. Actually, it seems more like a [bad] american movie. No wonder why hollywood remade it. The US version is better in a way. The ending is better in Ringu, but the rest of the movie is better in the remake. But to tell you the truth they are both pretty [terrible]. I just don't find an evil video tape scary. Sorry. If you want to get good Japanese films, get Battle Royale, Ichi the Killer, Tetsuo: the Iron Man, Tokyo Fist, Visitor Q, Wild Zero, STacy, and Junk."
4,A true eerie atmosphere when the tape rolls...,"A teenage girl dies after she has watched a video and her cousin Reiko, who is a reporter, begins to investigate what killed her niece. Reiko gets a hold of the same tape, which she watches and odd things begin to happen. She asks her ex-husband Ryuji to help her and he watches the tape too. Their research and the myths say that one will die seven days after one has seen the tape. Reiko and Ryuji now have to fight time in order to not only find an answer as to why people die, but also save their own lives. Ringu is a very chilling horror story that uses the technique of both contemporary horror as well as old fashion horror with a delicate touch. The film masters the elements of both surprise and expectation, and this crafts a truly great horror story that will keep the audience squirming and sweating in their seats."
2,Scary Movie!!!!!,I think this movie is the most scary movie I have ever seen. If you watch this this movie you probally wont go to sleep for 7 days. If I rated it on a scale 1-10 of scary movies I would give a 10.5
1,"Oh, please!","I too purchased this movie after reading so many great reviews. Gosh! Were we watching the same film? In a word, it stinks. Perhaps, if one spoke Japanese, it may have been a decent film, but the subtitling is the worst I have ever witnessed. Half sentences? Please. Perhaps one out of twenty lines are eventranslated, and those curiously unimportant. Without subtitling, the plot is almost impossible to decipher, and once you do, it's not scary at all. Don't waste your money."
1,Very bad movie,"I give this movie only 1 star for effort or else it would have gotten 1/2 star. This movie does not attempt to be scary, it's extremely boring, and LACKS special effects--a supernatural movie DOES need special effects, crime dramas don't. I've read the reviews on this site about this movie being better than the American version...no way. The cultural differences make it difficult to have empathy for the characters. Is it a rentable movie??? It's your call, but I would not suggest it."
1,I thru this movie back down the well!,"ok, this movie was NOT scary. it had a pretty good plot but it still sucked! The Ring (the american remake) was way better, but still not scary! If you want to see the scarest remake of a japanese horror flick, then go see The Grudge, starring my obsession.... Sarah Michelle Gellar!"
3,NOT VERY SCARY,"I gotta disagree with everyone on this flick. They all claim it to be way more scary than the American remake. Actually this did not scare me at all. I found it compelling yes, but I do like the American remake better. The American RING just speaks to me more and does more with the ideas. I was much more scared by RING 2, which I thought was awful but at least scary. RINGU entertained me, and I'm glad I own it, but it just doesn't rate as the horror classic everyone says it is. AUDITION maybe, but RINGU...no way."
5,Please call it RING not ringU... gaaa!!!,"anyways, as a mod of the Ringworld Forum, I thought I'd chime in, seeings how so many people tend to give bad reviews on these things.this movie, unfortuneately, is given a bad rap by many for not being scarry or cheap looking. well, it was pretty cheap, 6million to make (contrary to the 1mil figure someone else gave) however, this is quite high for a japanese film. ok, the point is, this is a movie done in the classic (guess these kids dont know) style of CINEMA... before the director of scream was even born, there was a guy named Alfred Hitchcock. he made GOOD movies (without CG), they were also given the title ""horror""... long since, the term has shifted to mean ""things that go bump so you can cop a feel off your girlfriend""...so lets clear up the muck and redefine what Ring actually is... Ring is a Psychological Thriller/Suspense. that is the official genre, NOT HORROR! now that you know, hopefully you can watch the movie with a virgin eye."
3,Before you snoor you see the Ringu,"I'm sure for Japanese viewers this must be a really good movie but I think that something is lost when the average American viewers watch this film, myself included.It is not the captions that make this movie unwatchable but rather that the performances are not done in the same style and tones that the Western viewer is comfortable with.For those who loved the American version of this film, don't expect the same impact as in The Ring."
3,Liked the Ring better.,"Monday, February 07, 2005 / 3 of 5 / Liked the Ring better.This is the Japanese predecessor to the Ring here in the states. I had just watched Ju-on and had this one as well. I felt it wasn't quite the film that Ring would become. It lacked the visceral terror, creepy atmosphere, and production values of the Ring. Still taken on its own it's fairly effective, although again I didn't even enjoy it as much as Ju-on. I think in the US version the mystery was handled with more panache instead of exposition by a `psychic' boyfriend who explains the girls power in a lump sum finish up ending. I also preferred the grainy, monochromatic gloom of the Ring locales vs Ringu. Ah well, still somewhat entertaining to watch."
4,The original is unmatched,"I disagree with the ones who didn't find the original at least as good as the American remake. This is Japan, my fellows, and you should understand that you are dealing with a different prospective of life. I think that the original ""Ringu"" is without the shadow of a doubt an excellent film, a film with no needs of strong effects or whatever to make you fell very uncomfortable during the view. I rate it very high : I have watched it five times so far and I have always enjoyed it as the first one. Very very scary."
4,Creepy,"Now, first of all, I thought Sadako was much better than Samara, because:They didn't use special effects throughout all of the Sadako sequences.Sadako's videotape is much more scarier than the U.S. version.Maybe this movie wasn't as scary, and I do like the U.S. versions was more enjoyable to watch, but I still did like Ringu."
3,Endless Cycle,"Ringu was an excellent movie, but I find I enjoyed the American version better. However, the Japanese movie explained things better.To get the full story I recommend the comic book, Ringu, then The Ring. This story, like Final Fantasy VII, leaves a lot open to discusion. Points like what Samara was, how her parents arranged her birth, how her curse worked, and other questions are pretty much left open to let the viewers decide for themselves.The Japanese version plays up the psychic power aspect more then the American version, to the point of using it only as a way to move the plot. That aside, this movie is a great movie, and it truely is one of the scarier ones I've seen."
2,It underestimates our inteligence.,"Ok, I've seen it after the american version and I was very disapointed. The problem is not the lack of special FX or the peculiarities of japanese culture, the thing is that in this version every single character seems to have paranormal powers, which is ridiculous. While in the american version the mystery is solved simply by examing carefully the images of the tape, in this one everybody has visions and dreams, which make the movie less rational (if we can say so of a horror movie). Also, the american version leaves more open doors to Samara's story (Sadako), this one tells everything."
1,unengaging,"This film did not impress me. This is the original story on which the US remake, The Ring, is based. There is less cohesive plot here, and much is left to the imagination. I don't see anything particularly compelling about this version nor anything I would consider superior to the original. It meandered a bit too much and did not engage me in the story."
1,This was HORRIBLE!!!,"I saw The Ring when it was in theatres, and kept hearing how Ringu was ten times scarier, even better... Uhm NOT! It was SO cheesy, I mean had I seen it first it MAY have creeped me out a little but I mean we were actually LAUGHING through a lot of it! You want a good scare see The Ring! Want a good comedy, see Ringu! I personally recommend not wasting your money on this though! How shady to advertise something as better when it's SO not!"
2,Made for television,"I'm not one of those people who can't enjoy a movie without special effects. In fact, I tend to prefer movies without special effects. I live in Japan and am a big fan of Japanese underground films. Now that I got that out of the way, let me tell you that this movie is not scary, not well acted (yes, I watched it in Japanese), and overall, very poorly made. The supposedly scary scenes use cheesy horror tricks to try and scare you and it just doesn't work. ""The tape"" is really short, and lacks the artistic edge of the tape in ""The Ring"". I've seen animations that were more unsettling. The story (what there is of it) progresses too quickly and the elements within that were omitted from ""The Ring"" were omitted for very good reasons. The only reason I gave it two stars is that maybe, just maybe, if I had not seen ""The Ring"" first I might have been mildy interested in this conveluted soup of a film. MAYBE.Bottom line, not worth your time."
1,Ringu,"RINGU and RING are the exact same movie, with a few little differences in the plot, but all in all - it's the same movie.RINGU was disappointing in comparision to RING. It's not as scary, not as visually shocking and just not worth the money.Rent before you Buy!!!"
1,Terrible,"I watched this film over the weekend because of all the hype it has been recieving. This movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. I have seen a lot of horror films and the sheer disappointment I was left with after watching this film was profound. The script for the film was decent and the plot moved along fairly smoothly, but those are the only two complements this movie deserves. The subtitled translation to english is very rough and at times puzzling. This alone is enough to kill any suspense and horror and turn the movie into something laughable. There was no point in the movie in which I was truly sucked into the action. This was no doubt due to the awkward acting, the poor music selection or lack thereof during tense moments and the aformentioned comical translation. If you like the idea of Ringu I suggest you watch the American counterpart, The Ring. I also recommend Frailty as another option, but I mostly recommend passing this one up."
4,Ringu,"I have recently been swept up in the wave of Japanese horror movies infiltrating our shores and have seen several of them. This is the only one that I can honestly say the American remake was a better movie, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. The scares in this movie depend very much on the fact that the viewer should not know whats going on, so having seen the remake and knowing where the plot was going took something away from the overall experience, but there are still plenty of genuinly chilling scenes, so I do recomend it even if you have seen the remake."
4,Made a lot more sense than the American version.....,"Well, I sure wish I had seen this one before The Ring. I was hardly spooked while watching this, mainly because it followed The Ring so much. However, it was nice to see a fresh concept behind the evil girl.While it may not give you nightmares, this one sure is good. Definately a good addition to anyone's collection. If you don't mind reading subtitles, that is."
4,Ringu- asks more of the audience...,"I actually rented ""Ringu"" before I saw the american version.I found ""The Ring"" to be dissapointing in comparison.The settings, score, the weird video were all better in ""Ringu"".I felt that ""The Ring"" was holding my hand, constantly flashing back to the video to remind us of plot and location. This was not necessary to anyone who is paying attention to the film. To me it felt as though it lessened the creepy factor present in the original. Finally, the climax and resolution were far more satisfying in ""Ringu""."
3,"Not as good as America's, but still creepy","Ringu was nothing like I expected. I have seen The Ring many times before, and I saw it before Ringu. I'd heard how Ringu was supposed to be a lot scarier than The Ring. I was quite dissapointed when I watched it - my friend and I kept dozing off, it was getting so boring! To us it looked like a cheap remake compared to The Ring. It's a good movie, but definately not as good as The Ring."
2,Disappointed by far!!!! Stick with the remake!,"I have been racking my brains trying to figure out why there is so much debate over RING + RINGU. i am beggining to think it is a thing of which you have seen first. I saw RING first and thoroughly enjoyed it, so hearing RINGU was scarier i was very excited. I see absolutley NO comparision. The RING(USA version) was so much scarier creepier and better acted by far! The lead woman in RINGU was very good however and the little girl walking towards the TV in RINGU twitching while she walked was extremely creepy. I guess this is a fun thing and a matter of taste. I guess everyone should watch both, but the question is now which one first because it seems like u wont like the second. Well if you are in USA get the remake then i guess. OH WHO KNOWS!!!!!! lol"
3,Thomas Ian Griffith - What more do I need to say?,"Finally, a Karate Kid movie with an actual martial artist in it! Thomas Ian Griffith gives a stellar performance as the Cobra Kai leader Terry Silver, a true villain in every sense of the word. Deapite the awful dialogue and extremely bad acting throughout the movie, Mr Griffith's presence makes this a must see for any Thomas Ian Griffith fan or just any fan of martial arts. The scene in which Terry Silver performs a kata in the Cobra Kai dojo speaks for itself and is a great demonstration of the skill possessed by Mr Griffith. I personally recommend this movie for all martial arts fans"
3,They sould have stopped it,"Part 3, for what? The first 2 films where very good, they explored the true meaning of Karate very well. This one is just a copy of the first one, of bad quality. Daniel is FAT!!! How can that be? And SLOW!!! What did happen since he returned from Okinawa? Did he eat too much suchi? Or did he think he was already a Master and just spent the last mounths sleeping? Anyway, the story is very bad, the former Cobra-Kai instructor wanted revenge so he asks help to an evil friend who hires a bad dude to kick Daniel's butt. Daniel looses faith in Miyagi, and starts training on his own, and soon realises he's been a dumb student all the way, so he returns to Miyagi and wins the tournament. The final fight is very, very bad and short.No special moves, imagine the first film without the special kick, and you have this final fight. Although bad, it's enternaining, but not worthy spending any money in it."
1,can't look away....,"I can't believe that people actually liked this film. I am shocked. I still think the first film is brilliant. But this one.. it is so awful that I can't help but watch it over and over again. Like a trainwreck, you'll have to look, and you'll never get the images out of your mind, but every day you will wish that you could...."
2,enough is enough,"They just can't leave well enough alone.Each sequel got progressively worse.The acting really sucked and will somebody please get rid of John Kreese once and for all!!The only real good martial artist in this movie was Thomas Ian Griffith,he at least brought some life to this otherwise boring movie."
4,elisabeth shue needs to come back,this movie was alright but c'mon face it they need to get ali back. she was the life of the first one and the reason i watched. any body who is a fan of elisabeth shue's work would agree with me. YOU NEED HER BACK!
1,The Karate Kid Part 3 Review,"It's nothing more then a knockoff of the first film. Same Story,same fights,same bad guys & same everything else. The ONLY thing different is that this film has 2 bad guys instead of 1. overall,Buy the first film instead. I give this DVD a 1 out of 10."
1,Dumb sequel,I thought the Karate Kid 3 was the worst Karate Kid film I have ever seen if I were you I wouldn't waste your money on this stupid movie it's dumb.
1,KK3,As if we needed another KK3 after KK2 but what else would lil Danny do. He's 47 and still going to Reseda High School. In this flick Danny must fight an evil billionaire who has stopped his company to seek revenge on Danny b/c he's old nam buddys with the Kobra Kia sensia. The only question I have to ask is why doesn't Danny just move to Idaho? This worked for Demi Moore.
2,Bonsai galore.,"The Karate Kid Part III is so painfully bad - you can't look away! Ralph Macchio looks so uninspired and he gained a lot of weight, poor kid. Pat Morita's deadpan expressions have always been funny but some of his magic is gone as well. The acting from those dumb karate teachers is so horrible and even Robyn Lively seems stiff. Parts 1 and 2 are excellent, check those out instead."
2,Meh,"The second Karare Kid movie was a great sequel - and it should have been left as it was. But I guess people thought it'd be a good idea to make a trilogy. Okaaaay... well, there are some good parts in this film, but it definitely lacks the charm/spark of the first two Karate Kid movies. There's not much continuity, Daniel gets a girlfriend despite the events in the second film, and the storyline just feels forced/contrived to continue the franchise. If you're a completist, go ahead and watch this, but I say definitely rent before you buy."
3,"Not bad but I like the ""new karate kid better""","Not bad but it was starting to get to be the same old thing with these Karate Kid movies. Worth the few bucks to kill some time. But I truely liked ""The New Karate Kid"" better."
2,"It's OK, but a Must-Have for Karate Kid Fans","I'll be honest; it is not as good as the first two. But, I had to buy it because it is part of the series, priced very cheaply ($6.99) and came with a promotional ticket ($10) for the new Karate Kid movie with Jaden Smith.The movie is pretty ""dark"" and I mean literally. One would think it could have been remastered. Anyhow; the storyline is ok and at least you know what becomes of Master Silver."
1,A midnight screening would be amazing...It's ripe,"I've seen this film about 20 times. I bet you're thinking...""He saw it 20 times and gave it 1 star.."" The answer.....Yep. This movie's definately a heap. But I'd personally watch a train wreck over and over than watch some of the recent heaps... like ""Twister"" and ""Independence Day"". This movie's so bad that it would make an amazing midnight feature. It has cult potential. One evening my brother was seeing a stranger at the other end of a bar doing what seemed to be a scene from KKIII with friends. Upon closer inspection, he was correct. There is definately an cult audience for this movie, but more for its awfulness than its greatness.So bad....it's great!!WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
3,Karate Kid,Karate Kid Rocks - but theme not quite followed through on. So was a bit dissapointing. But great to see the team together.
1,Even worse than you would expect for a part 3,"The whole family loved part 1, and part 2 was not too bad. Part 3 is ridiculously awful. The villains are so extremely evil, it's very unsettling to watch. You keep waiting for something good to happen, but it never does, until that last 3 seconds of the movie.. BUT, that doesn't even come close to fixing the extreme dilemma. The team of villains, lead by an infinitely rich psychopath, end up with even more reason (not that they ever really had any reason in the first place) to continue torturing Daniel. If you want to feel good after the movie, then stop after part 1 or 2. Part 3 will leave you wishing for a part 4 where ALL of the evil predators get mauled to death by lions."
2,one sequel too far,"After part II this movie is kind of a mockery of the Karate Kid.You get the feeling he doesn't know any real Karateand you actually feel sorry for him being stuck in this awfulplot and having to get beat up inn the final match tokeep his title?I didn't like the movieand it pretty much gave American Karate a bad name?The board breaking damaged hands and feet of ""hard"" Karatecontrast with all the Hong Kong ( Kung) Fu movies.The Chinese fighting style is just more graceful?I didn't like the movieand I thought of the three movies II was the best."
2,HAM FISTED DIRECTION SINKS THIS ONE!,"Like the first sequel to the Karate Kid and the ""Rocky"" sequels I did not expect this to be an Oscar winner, but thought it would be enjoyable. This is not as good as the first two movies and I will have to watch the Next Karate Kid to decide if it is better than that one. The biggest problem with this installment is that the direction is so heavy handed it's like a sledgehammer to the face! I never thought I would get to use the term ""ham fisted"" in a review, but this is the perfect opportunity! The new villain in this movie should get the ""Ham of the Year "" award! I was able to get through it, but it was worse than I remembered. Morita saves the picture, but even he looks like he is sleepwalking through this mess. The DVD transfer looks good."
2,bad acting,"What kills me about this movie is the bad acting. Part 1 and 2 was good it fit it's time the mid 80's. By the time part 3 came out RM was too old to play that role and he acted like a dorky little pussey throughout the whole movie. How could daniel and miyagi been so stupid not to know they getting played just watch it you will see how naive they really were. This movie lacks alot imagination and there no sole to it. They could have used better acting or even have johnny come back and help Daniel get back at kreese. I don't know i first saw this in the movies, in 1988 i was disappointed then, and still am today. There just so much more of a twist to the story to keep you interested like i said Daniel La russo acted like a DORK BIG TIME."
3,Kind of a dissapointment,"This definetly wasn't as exciting and fun as Part 1 and 2. Too many times in this one did I want to turn the tape off and finish it the next day. There was a lot of unpleasant anxiety and scariness wondering was going to happen to Daniel. The only enjoyable moments were the the times he spent with Jessica and the very end fight. Even though this one still very visibly had the same director as the first two, I still didn't like where this one's plot went. The plot was just not exciting, enjoyable, or pleasant for the most part. Part 2 was more of a fun and exciting action movie, Part 1 was more of a fun and exciting story movie. Part 3 was a sad and pathetic ending to the trilogy. Plus, Ralph's put on a few pounds for this one."
2,The Bonsai Kid,The third series of Karate Kid is the least favorite among the series(including Karete Girl one). The plot itself is not bad.Miyagi sensei in ambiguous manner warns against recent show-like atmosphere of the tournament itself and power-stressed styles. But it could have been much better presented in this film. Opening is really terrible. It ruins the whole plot. It's like rotten episode of 007 or Mitsukuni Mito the deputy-Shogun samurai drama. The previous series indicated some nice strategy so that Daniel-san could defeat the opponent in the end. But this one has none. It is quite unconvincing that Daniel san could win the Kobura-kai kids with latest Karate technics. I do not believe Kata alone can defeat the opponent.Miyagi-san's love for Bonsai is very understandable but it took time for the movie too much.Recommended only for die-hards.
3,"Works ok, but then so does a can of White Kidney Beans.....","I've used this product before and have had mixed results. For the most part, its efficacy is pretty much as stated, so long as you actually follow the instructions. That being said, read my title (above), go to your local grocery store and then do the math..........."
4,Natrol Carb intercept,I purchased Natrol Carb Intercept from Amazon.com.The product arrived promptly and in good condition.This is my second purchase of this product from Amazon.I believe the best way to control carbohydrate consumption is by blocking its metabolism.In my case I believe carbohydrates are my biggest problem.
3,No clue if it actually worked.,"This product didn't really do a great deal for me in regards to helping me lose some weight. I have been taking this product for about 2 months and have since lost about 4 pounds. I can't really tell if the pills helped or if I am just naturally losing weight from exercise. 4 pounds really isn't a great deal of weight to lose so I can't say they did much, but they apparently work for some people.I'm giving this 3 stars because it didn't do much for me at all, but I really can't just say it doesn't work."
2,Carb Intercept,"Used as directed and found no difference, no weight loss. I am not sure if one month use is long enough to show results."
3,Carbb blocker,"I've been taking this product for over a year now. I'm not sure if it works or not. It has never caused me to lose weight, However, I have not gained much either and I do not diet. I eat reasonably most anything I want. which would probably cause me to gain if I wasn't taking these pills and I also take Alli along with it."
1,twas too good to be true!!,"I know the too good to be true saying, but I guess I still have hope. This product has done nothing to help with weight loss. I am on my second bottle now. It was a waste of money-I won't be a fool for this one again."
1,Not as expected,"I ordered white kidney bean extract and did not find this to be effective. It contained so many other ingredients, I felt it affected the potency and for that reason I was not satisfied with the product. I will not reorder. I didn't feel it had enough of the ingredient I ordered. I will look for something with a greater concentration of white kidney bean extract."
2,Chromium UGH,When I ordered this product and I order not 1 but 2 bottles I read all the ingredients. When the product comes I found it also has Chromium in it. Well I can not take Chromium it makes my heart race and I just feel weird all day. Lord help me if I take at night because I would not sleep at all. I hate that I was duped on the ingredients as I know they make White Bean Extract with nothing else added.Now I have to search to buy something without the Chromium and I'm hesitant as I can't afford to keep buying things I can't take.
4,CUTS OFF MY HUNGER AND NO BUZZ,"I am surprised as to how well THIS CUTS my desire to eat without the buzz. It's VERY VERY helpful to me but I only have about five vanity pounds or so to lose so I am lucky that way. But I work out too. When I work out, I'm one of those wherein I DO GET hungry. CARB INTERCEPT really SHUTS off my desire and I take ONE PILL each morning. I love this product. It's just what I needed. note: I PAY ATTENTION. I decide ""am I feeding my eyes or do I need fuel."" So thinking while using is what I urge folks to do. THEN when you DO reach for food, reach for FIBER RICH foods which help you get full, stay full longer, and keep yourself regular."
3,Use it to prevent off-gassing,"I never believed the stuff would make me lose weight. My colonic bacteria produce Herculean amounts of methane, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia; but not when I take Carb Intercept before meals. Beano never worked for me."
3,Good for maintaining and/or with a low carb diet,"The Carb Intercept isn't a miracle pill. It's not a 'true' diet pill like hydroxycut or alli. However, it's good for cheat days. I typically take this pill about once every week and a half for family functions, friends' birthdays, etc. Places where I might not have much of a choice what to eat or where a low fat/low carb option may be unavailable. Don't expect crazy weight loss. Like I said, I think its more intended for maintaining weight loss.Be warned though: if you plan on eating a lot of crappy food, you might experience diarrhea. I took one pill and ate fast food, pasta, and chocolate. Spent the night on the toilet lol."
2,ehh,Did not notice any effects after a whole bottle. I can't say that I am impressed with it. Somewhat disappointed.
1,carp intercept,this didnt go anything for me it was a waste of money & it wouldnt purchase it again. It might work for body builder but not me.
4,worked for me,I'm on the less carb diet but when I have a cheat day I usually gain four pounds. After taking these pills twenty min's before I ate it cut those pounds in half I now only gain two pounds when i cheat. This product has made it easy to lose weight and is really great when I get weak and want to cheat. Just make sure you wait the twenty min's I've tried taking it right before eating without waiting and it didn't work as well.
1,Didn't work for me,Took it for one who month and nothing. Didn't eat fatty but not complete fat free. Did eat starches. I took it 10 minutes before every meal. Nothing.
5,it really works!!,"i have been taking 6 capsules a day and it has been 6 days, i have already lost 3.3 lbs. no joke. it works!! plan to loose more."
2,no results for me,"I tried this product last year, with high hopes. Carbs are my downfall. I cut back on calories while taking Carb Intercept and followed the instructions carefully. After finishing an entire package, I lost 1 pound. I am at an age (52) where losing weight is getting more difficult, but i did expect to lose a few pounds. I did not have any side effects at all while taking this, however, which is why I gave it 2 stars."
5,amazing,"I have always been a skinny person, but Now on my 30s I start to gain weight. NO extra workout seems to work , no diet, no exercise. So a friend of mine recomended this product, and I have lost those stuborn 8 pounds I have been gainning in the last 4 years, in a matter of a month. My stomact looks flat, and I start getting a six pack. It also regulates my disgestion. This product is amazing. It work magically for me."
1,Does not work :(,"I followed the directions faithfully and no results. The side effect was terrible gas! Don't eat cheese if you're going to take this product! Your stomach will act as a rollercoaster after you eat pasta or bread. Such a dissapointment :( I thought this was going to be my ""miracle pill"" Not recommended."
1,Just eat less,I think I actually GAINED weight! Best bet is the South Beach Diet then you don't have to worry about carbs at all. These made me feel very bloated.
1,Did not like!,"Be careful if you are sensitive to caffiene. I used these for 2 days. I did not sleep either night. And I took them before lunch. I bought mine at GNC and returned them today. I also felt very bloated when I used them, as if I had not taken them. This is how I feel when I carb load. My heart was racing and headache was soooo bad!So they did not work for me. I know not all products work the same for everyone. But I would not recommend these to anyone with a caffiene sensitivity."
4,Love it still,"It has worked for me and with diet and exercise I lost 14 lb. in 4 weeks. This is a vast improvement for me. Especially since I need the extra help for family meals, or when you have mixed foods that contain just enough carbohydrates to skew your blood sugar and start a craving. When I take this stuff with a meal, i can stop when I am satisfied and not overeat."
3,carb blocker,i have been only taking them for a week and i dont see any change yet. but they got here really quick and it was a good deal conpared to the same product at GNC
3,Carb Intercept Review,"I have not noticed any significant results yet and really don't expect any because I am very irregular with taking this supplement. Do feel that over time, it will be effective."
2,Not very good.,"I am not impressed with the results from taking this. I think there are too many high scoring reviews, which is usually the case on Amazon."
4,HAPPY,I have used this products time and time again and I am so pleased with the results. I have eaten many carb meals and not gained a pound and even lost pounds. Being all natural is a plus.
1,Didn't help at all,"Followed directions, excerised daily, continued eating healthy, had same small amount of carbs as ususal. However, no miracles or even additional weight loss with product. Took for 3 months. Save your money."
3,It's not spectacular,I take the pills before I eat starches. I think it helps somewhat but not as much as I expected after the reviews.
1,Horrible digestive problems with this supplement!,"Watch out! You'll spend the entire time in the bathroom after taking this product. If it helps you lose weight, it's because of the diahrea!"
3,"""Good""",Its a good quality net easy to handle the weights are durable. The only problem Ihave is the hand line's quality is not so good the nylon frays pretty easily and then it can give youlittle cuts.
5,Rodney Dangerfield at his best,"This is a thoughly enjoyable story about a middle aged successful man who goes back to college.Many older students will get a kick out of this saga and in parts of the film, identify with him."
1,Poor blue ray master,"This is a great Rodney Dangerfield film. The comedian is at his best. The blue ray, however, fails miserably. It's poorly transferred, very grainy often. MGM should've done a much better job!"
4,Back to school is almost back to the past,"Not so fine as in first time I saw it when I was 17 years old. I think it was most exciting due as teen, I feel the same about parents, now many years after I don't agree in all.This picture is suitable for a relaxed sunday afternoon, it is funny and you can have a good time.If you look for a state-of-art film... your are in the wrong place."
4,Pure-Rodney,"Pure Rodney mayhem, when he decides to join college to keep his son from dropping out of school. R.D. is at his best with the wisecracks, insults and jokes. The supporting cast is well suited to keep R.D. entertained. Dean Martin would like to see you ! Great Comedy from the famous one-liner himself."
3,NEW DELUXE TREATMENT IS NOT SO GREAT! CLASSIC COMEDY,"Rodney Dangerfield's classic blue collar comedy is very funny, although I prefer 'Easy Money' to this film, it's still a must have. I have the older edition which is OK, but I was not all that happy with the newest edition to make the upgrade. This film deserves better."
2,Mildly amusing film.,"This is a not too funny film from the mid-1980s. It was mildly humorous at best, it doesn't hold up well over the years. A few funny Dangerfield one-liners is about the best this film has to offer. Dangerfield's character is one you like, but he just doesn't deliver the laughs he should. One interesting footnote is that the Rowen Atkinson's, sight gag of preparing the coffee in his mouth, which he did on his show and the movieBean: The Moviecan be seen here, done by Rodney Dangerfield. I'm not sure, but it looks like Dangerfield was first! If you love 80s comedies, then you'll probably get a kick out of this one."
2,"Typical formula ""anti-conformist"" comedy","This is a template, one-dimensional liberal comedy attacking conservative Ivy League culture, with the same tired leukophobic stereotypes (professors talking like British aristocrats, privileged but cowardly jocks, etc.) as every other example of this overplayed McDonald's genre. The outsiders are the good guys, and, of course, the Ivy League women prefer them, blah, blah, blah. The nerdy outsider gets the girl.The vapid, inbred leukophobes in Hollywood crank out at least ten of these a year, and there's nothing to distinguish this one from any of the others, save the limited 80's flashback nostalgia factor."
2,Nothing to recommend,"A syrupy sweet story of a dad and his semi-estranged son, this film feels like a low-rated sitcom. Other than a handful of smile moments, it's neither funny or remarkable at all. I'm not sure which of the film's premises are more frightening: Dangerfield the smart, confident, self-made businessman, or Dangerfield the expert diver. It's not that you should avoid it, but there are so many better films to see."
5,a classic movie,"This version of Back To School has a couple of extras about the man who got no respect and where the line came from! For those who have never seen this. Rodney Dangerfield stars is this comedy and show a comical view at business, school, and the new york italian sort of comedy."
4,"Funny movie, beautiful backdrop!","Ok, I confess, I worked at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and watched this movie being made. It gave no CLUE how funny it was until I saw the finished product. This is easily the best of the Dangerfield movies, including lots of classic ""Rodney"" moments and some good work by the supporting actors. Look for Deep Space 9's Terry Farrell (""Jadzia Dax"") in a supporting role too. Also, now that I live in California, looking at this movie is like a postcard from home. The University of Wisconsin-Madison was a gorgeous setting for this movie!"
4,Good for some howls,"Not a great film or necessarily a purchase but one well worth watching many times over. Robert Downey Jr. is a real trip as Derrick Lutz the wise cracking anti-student. My favorite scene of the film though has to be the one with Sam Kinison as the history professor. 'Say it, SAY IT!!' And you can just look at Rodney and laugh. The way he walks, his expressions. The film is just flat out funny.You won't have to pick yourself up off the floor laughin' but you'll be thoroughly entertained."
3,Back to School,"You know, the only reason I keep watching this movie that everyone else fails to remember, is that Danny Elfman and Oingo Boingo have an appearance in this film....it's a dead man's party who could ask for more..."
4,what a great prouduct.,I have never owned such a great prouduct. I first purchased this item in march 2005 for my living room. In December I purchased an hdtv so I upgraded to an hd dvr. But I did not want to turn it off because I loved it and it had all of my recorded shows on it. So I put it in my room and I enjoy it. Thank you very much directv for making such a great prouduct. Heck no wonder you are so popular. michael stimson
3,"Good, but not my favorite","I'm a huge Serge Reggiani fan and ordered this one cause it had a few of my favorites songs that the other CD ""Serge Reggiani"" did not have such as Ma Fille and Le Deserteur. This CD is live and is less polished, and his voice seems to go off key and tempo sometimes. (I'll blame the accompanists). I still enjoy it but would have selected a different CD with the songs had I known."
4,okay for the basics,"a little to simple and the projects are somewhat uninteresting. but, it does give a good jumping point for glass fusing and it is very easy to read."
5,A must have...,"...book for anyone interested in learning the art of glass fusing! In an ""Introduction to Glass Fusing"" author Petra Kaiser provides a clear, concise and easy to understand road map for beginners / novices to learn how to work with glass. Kaiser provides much needed information like: tools of the trade, information re: various kiln options, understanding how to work with the various glass and much, much more.Bottom-line, a ""must have"" for anyone starting out as well as a great reference for current glass fusers!"
2,Could be better,Written with an ablosute goodwill to teach the technique to the readers but it does not help to procees with the book i.e. how to place the glasses into kiln...
4,Glass Fusing,Not really a how to book. Has overview's of what I consider complex instructions. Nice pictures and a pretty book.
5,A Great Workbook!!,"Someone said that fused glass artists need to learn to live with disappointment and if you experimented with glass fusing, you know what they mean. That said, this book is a great way to get started and do projects which will get you past many of the mistakes you would have made stumbling about on your own.When I bought my kiln, I had the idea that I would be able to start making my own glass from scraps and be on my way to using up all that scrap and creating great art. I imagined cranking out dishes every day.Many broken and fractured pieces later, a friend recommended this book and I immediately began to get a better understanding of what fusing glass was really about."
5,Dog eared & used well.,"This book is great for beginners. I've got the ""big"" eye candy books as well, but always return to this one for the best firing schedules. I've got notes on almost every page and it's always the first one I grab. Also good is that it shows what a piece will look like with 2 or 3 layers of glass compared to just one. New to fusing? Get this one."
5,Dairy Cattle Judging Techniques,"This is an excellent and informative book for anyone wanting to judge, cattle, horses, dogs, etc. It is easy to read and understand with good graphics."
4,ferret fruit treat,My ferrets like the fruit bits in this treat. They aren't too keen on the hard food that comes with the fruit.
4,Best of Poker,This is an above average training tool. It will help you realize what hands to play and what the outcome is when you push your luck.
2,All Fluff No Fun,"Though the characters in Deaver's novel are compelling and quirky, the story itself leaves much to be desired. I was forcing myself to turn the last few chapters because I realized something early on. The Bone Collector - the central killer - is not scary and you really don't care about any of his victims. The killer and his prey are merely structures to keep the main heroes revolving and moving. Though the book is fast paced, the action and the ending are hardly worth the effort. Even though Deaver is in much better command of the written word, I recommend Patterson's brisk storytelling over this sour brain candy novel."
1,Frustrating Plot Holes,"I am just trying to ""get into"" this book, which I had heard was supposed to be great, but there such a gigantic plot mistake introduced in chapter 2 that I am ready to give up. Between 9:30 and 10:00 a.m. Amelia finds the murder victim. Can anyone explain how, barely an hour and a half later, the police show up at Rhyme's door asking him to review the police report, which has already been typed up, and indicates that some evidence has been tested by the lab? This is absurd, and unless someone can explain it to me, I will not read any further."
1,Very Disapointed!,There was no product description and I know why. The book was not in good condition. The first 10 pages are scotch taped into the book. I am very disapointed in the seller for not using a description to inform buyers of the state the book is in. I would not buy from this seller again. To any other buyers be advised on what you are buying.
4,A truly amazing novel,"Deaver's first licoln rhyme novel was truly amazing. the plot moved along and had enoguh twists to keep me guesing. As a former NYPD officer and FBI agent, i found the technical aspects to be true to life and the procedural inter-departmental rivalies were quite amusing as well. I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys procerdural police/FBI novels or a former cop like myself."
4,QUITE A REFRESHING READ!,"So the author takes a few flying leaps--so what? If we wanted complete reality, why read fiction? Unique, and wonderfully focused on the heros as opposed to the genre's typical focus on the villian. For a change the protagonist was much more interesting. Two thumbs up!"
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK........,"I bought this book at seven in the morning on a Sunday in September. I got home at nine and I sat down to read it. I was stuck in the same recliner until six in the evening. It was an incredible book, combining suspense, science and romance into this enthralling package. I was impressed, to say the least."
3,Okay...not great,"This book kept my attention fairly well but I can't say I loved it. All the acronyms were annoying and the police jargon seemed forced. His writing style distracted me from the content of the book.So...the story was good, the writing style was awful."
5,I almost peed my pants,"What a great book! Before reading The Bone Collector, I had been reading a lot of more serious literature, and it was a great, thrilling way to take a break from ""thinking"" books. I am also a chemist and really enjoyed Deaver's descriptions of forensic procedure, although I definitely felt a little ""geeky"" because I knew what all the analytical instruments were. But either way, it was a wonderful exciting story. Aside from the fact that I found the book to be a great read, I would also like to note that The Bone Collector is the very first book that I have ever gotten my boyfriend to read. He usually despises reading, but while reading this book, he almost became anti-social because he wanted to read it all the time."
4,Like Crazy Glue for the mind,"This is the only book by J.D. I have read, and I must say he is one hell of a writer. The courage it takes to write about a paralyzed main character, and to make it believable in the process takes some imagination.The plot of this book was very well laid out, there was no fat to add to the mix, just good solid fun. The murders by the killer were original. And the tight story line had me biting my nails to see who the next victim would be, and how they would ultimately display the next clue. I highly recommend this book.Just an aside, the movie was good even with its weaker ending but nothing like the novel."
4,Bone Collector,"I think seeing the movie first, before reading the book, was a mistake. The book should have come first. Too many things in the book were changed. I still loved the book."
4,compared to the movie,"I enjoyed the book and found the movie closely followed the book. Unfortunately, having seen the movie first, the book is slightly different. Which is understandable as you can't possibly make a movie exactly the way the book is written.On the whole, I did enjoy the book.The book would be better if you haven't seen the movie first."
4,Addictive Book in need of a SEQUEL,"I felt like a true addict reading this book! I simply could not put it down! Between the technical proficiency of Jeff Deaver and the fast-paced plot, I was very pleased with this novel. I read anything, rarely to test literary merit, and this book is at the top of my list as a great story. Come on Deaver!! Don't leave me hanging! You've got to write a sequel! Excellent read and well worth the time. BUY IT NOW!!!!"
4,Fast-Paced and Exciting... AlthoughNot Much Depth,"For those of us who read for entertainment value first and literary value second, this is certainly a worthwhile read. I would liken it to a Schwartzenegger movie...fast-paced and very exciting, but not entirely memorable. This book is heavy on the technology angle, which is not necessarily bad (Tom Clancy fans can appreciate such detail), but more energy could have been devoted to character development. I didn't leave the story particulalry liking (or even hating) any of the characters.It's no ""Silence of the Lambs"", where you held true passion in your like and dislike of the characters, but it is a good read in its own right."
4,A Read While You Are Walking Kind of Book,"I really enjoyed ""A Maiden's Grave"" so I was thrilled when I saw ""The Bone Collector"". I was NOT disappointed. This book was in front of me as I was eating, walking and (when I could get away with it) working. It keeps you guessing all the way up to the end of the book."
3,"The ultimate wheelchair detective, but mundane otherwise.","I picked up this book at the library due to the interesting premise on the back cover: a quadriplegic detective. ""Cool,"" I thought, ""this is the ultimate armchair detective novel."" I still think the gimmick is ""cool"", but I was otherwise pretty disappointed by this book. I found Lincoln Rhyme's character almost believable, but I couldn't identify with his female sidekick/protegee. Why does she have to be a beautiful ex-model (other than guaranteeing a large male audience for the upcoming movie)? Also, everybody had a painful past--too many painful pasts in one book (outside of Wuthering Heights). The mystery itself was interesting at first, but I found the end too pat. I was also disappointed by the too-neat tie-in to the next book. Yes, I probably will read the next book--I always want to know how things end up--but I'm checking it out of the library instead of paying for it."
3,"Liked it, but could not finish it.","In the beginning of this book I thought this was going to be a great read, but at page 318 I realized my interest had died. The story of the hideous crime followed by incredible police work had been repeated at least once too often. Then the relationship between Rhyme and Sachs bored me.At page 318 I was pretty sure they would save a few more victims using amazing police work. They would probably catch the crazy guy or leave it open for a sequel. Rhyme and Sachs would admit their love for each other and Rhyme would decide to live. I just didn't have the energy to spend another 100 or so pages hearing about it.This book had the potential to be great if the editor had snipped at least another 200 pages."
3,"A good read, but not a great one!","A better than average story; however three major problems I had were: 1.) the CONSTANT, boring use of technical acronyms 2.) the unrealistic way in which the clues were solved so quickly 3.) the lame, too quickly contrived ending. If anyone asked me if the book was worth reading, I'd tell them it wasn't a total waste of time, but make sure you check the book out at the library. More riveting and with that ""true life is stranger than fiction"" edge,is John Douglas' ""Mindhunter"" - a far better read!"
3,A good suspense story despite the flaws.,"The Bone Collector was suspensful, the background interesting and the characters were intriguing. Especially Lincoln Rhymes. However, the writer's style of constantly using sentence fragments often made the book read awkward. This coupled with run on sentences as well made it inconsistent prose. Also, there could have been a lot less criminal science information which slowed the pace of the book. Overall, I think anyone who likes police/crime drama will enjoy this book if you can get past the poor sentence structure."
4,Can't wait for the movie,"A strong effort. I actually liked the Coffin Dancer better, but The Bone Collector was still one of the best books I have read in the last year."
5,unbelievable clift hangers & unexpected air pocketing twists,"This book was like non I've ever encountered. Fast pace, stupendous twists, unique characters, intellectually informative, and all that. And when you think you had all you can take Deavers gives you some more. Read it now before the movie. And sistahs, Denzel will be the leading character in the movie. Now picture that as you read."
5,Powerfully Gripping Police Suspense Novel,"Jeffery Deaver weaves such a web between the covers of this book.The character expositions is masterfully constructed, the technical references (to police lingo and equipment) put you in the room with Rymes and the other officers.You'll be on the edge of your seat from page to page."
2,Hated It!,"This book was a JOKE. The so-called suspense in this story didn't even come close to killing me. You have a disabled know-it-all forensics detective, who just got on my last nerve, and his dumb sidekicks solving a huge puzzle that did nothing but get on my nerves. And the ending was the most worst part of this whole book. Definitely not even close to being worth the money I payed for it."
3,"Macabre, macabre, macabre","I could not find the praise for this book. It stems from a mind steeped early on in Sesame Street's backalleys and smelly garbage containers. The gloom of a paralysed hero and a redhaired rheumatic heroine spreads throughout. There is much unbelievable stuff in the story, and the forensic methods are stressed to the boredom of the reader. Gloom and doom are spiced with waste and trash. A wonderland for bottom-feeders. I expected the same-titled film with Denzel Washings, Angelina Jolie, Queen Latifah to be a horror-flick, but it is just a suspense thriller..."
2,Don't collect this book,"The forensic details were fascinating, but the storyline was hard to swallow. The characters were flat and the identity of the ""unsub"" was ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,Gripping Read,This book was phenomenal. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Definitely much better than the movie.
5,The Bone Collector,Thoroughly enjoyed it. I found it full of suspense and the characters were interesting.I would recommend it to anyone who likes crime and forensics.
4,Excellent!,"This is the first Deaver book I read. Now I'm on a mission to read them all. The story behind this book is simple. A madman is on the loose in NYC, kidnapping victims and leaving clues behind for the police to find the victims. If they are not found in time, they meet with a horrible death.Knowing this, the police turn to an ex-cop, Lincoln Rhyme, famous criminalist who was retired after a spinal column injury. Now a quadriplegic, he is forced back into service knowing he is the only one who can catch the madman. With the assistance of a team he assembles, including the beautiful Patrolwoman Amelia Sachs, they set out on the villians trail.This book was a page-turner. The charcters are developed quickly and in depth. You are immediately swept up into action and it doesn't end until the end. I didn't find one thing boring about this book. The only disappointing part was the ending which seemed a little far fetched. But I still recommend this whole-heartedly!"
4,Darkly fascinating,"The Bone Collector has the dark appeal of bestsellers like Hannibal and The Triumph and the Glory but is set in a more common environment than wartime or the twisted regions that pass for Hannibal Lector's mind. If you like Cornwell type books you'll like this one, they are quite similar."
2,Same old story line,"I bought this book because I enjoy true crime novels and thought that this may be equivalent, but was I wrong! I read it on a flight from Los Angeles to Minneapolis, and decided to leave it on the plane. I could barely bring myself to finish it. The entire book is corny--the ease at which the case is solved, the dialogue, the prose, and basically the entire story line. How about something original? When I closed the book, I didn't care anything about either of the two main characters, or even the victims. And the tie in for the next novel at the end was just pathetic."
5,READ IT! READ IT! READ IT!,"AWESOME READ! For weeks, I was NOT going to read this book. It did not appeal to me. I am SOOO glad I did. What a ride. Be prepared NOT to put it down from start to finish. This one is a WINNER!!"
3,A clever book.,"Even though I enjoyed reading this book, I prefer the movie (it brought the story to life & Angelina Jolie played the character of Amelia perfectly). It's a good msytery novel, unpredictable & detailed. But my favourite J Deaver novel is still The Blue Nowhere."
5,taut vibrant forensic thriller,"I hope there is a sequel to this vibrant, taut thriller. The detective is as unconventional as can be found anywhere in detective/thriller/murder books. The exquisitely human characters leapt off the page and I found that I could not put this book down until I had finished. I immediately felt regret upon the conclusion because my time had ended with these marvelous characters. I sincerely hope there will be more sleuthing by Lincoln Rhyme who is a truly unique fictional detective."
3,Gripping! Believable... till you reach the ending...,"It has it all: unique protagonists, a clever plot, attention to details... except a decent ending. When the identity of the killer is finally revealed, you would think Deavers was in a hurry to finish the novel. The ending's contrived thus opened the an otherwise tight novel to a lot of plotholes. But it's still worth reading."
4,"Excellent, this man can write","I found The Bone Collector to be a thrilling, exciting, and absorbing chiller. Definitly one of the best in this genre that I have read. (And I have read many). Jeffrey Deaver knows how to keep us on the edge of our seats for the entire book. I have now bought all of his others, except one which I will get soon. Don't miss this exciting writer."
4,Great Book! Lousy Movie!,"I'm fascinated by forensics and DEAVER takes you where the criminalist dares to tread. The characters were well developed and the killer brought old New York to life. The movie captured none of this. Denzel although good, didn't have the mean streak that Rhyme in the novel manifests. The cocky Dellray was replaced by a boring substitute. The victims, who had so much voice in the novel, were one dimensional. The killer; not the same in the novel-WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? I've seen ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Man Hunter"" and read the books. Good work can be done!"
4,Excellent suspense....riveted to the end,"I read this book since it was the first of the Rhyme series. I put it off, because I think I saw the movie. I loved this book!I think the unique idea of the criminalist being a quadraplegic is phenomenal. Deaver has reached high level.Rhyme is asked to help find a serial killer in Manhatten. What he is actually doing is putting off his suicide. Amelia Sachs was the first one on the scene of one of the murders. Purely by accident. She was actually on her way to her new job in Public Affairs. Rhyme is intreged by her because she stops a train and halts traffic on a major road.She is really not wanting to help on the scene. But as she gets more involved and learns the personal side of Rhyme, she is pulled in. She is good.This book is so good I actually wanted to find the old book mentioned ""Old Crimes of NY"". It also made me want to visit NY and study it's history...criminal history."
4,4.5 : read this book! even if you've seen the movie,"absolutely terrific. Even though I had seen the movie before I read the book there was still plenty more to the story. I wish I had read the book first, but it is still a must read for mystery/thriller lovers.Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the ending different in the movie? (I haven't seen the film in a while, but while reading the book I thought ""the bone collector"" was someone other than the person it turned out to be.)"
4,As good as it gets,"How would you like to see the blood of the innocent shed? How would you like to hear the sound of human bones breaking? Or, maybe you'd like to feel the pain of your flesh being cut through to the bone?Who thinks of these distrubing images? Why, it's none other than the images of (Unsub 823.) Who seems to like history and old things, but takes only random victims.If you like mystery, suspense and thrills, you'll love this book just as much as I did. Everyone likes the movie, but I think the book is better. It has very detailed descriptions of everything you'd need to know about crime scenes and physcial evidence to last you a while.Just when you think the case is solved, you find another clue that leads to other victims and perps. To find out who Unsub 823 is and which officer finds him you'll have to read the book."
2,"High Concept, Low Execution","The idea is catchy and the author appears to really know what he's writing about. On the other hand, the book is poorly written, the characters, particularly the fashion model turned police woman, are not at all credible, and the ending is a cheat. Persoally, I'd suggest skipping the book and renting the movie, which is prettygood."
2,Relatively boring book,"I never felt like I was able to get into this book like I should have. I never really felt any sympathy for any of the characters, including Lincon Rhyme or the victims of the crimes. The plot kind of meandered through the lives of the various victims and law enforcement officials, without providing any gripping tension. I was quite suprised by teh person committing the crimes, but it wasn't shocking. There are some nice moments, but overall I wasn't impressed."
4,Full Of Suspense!,"I have not yet seen the movie. I always read a book before seeing the film. I was always a Stephen King fan until I realized I only really enjoyed the first few books I'v read by Mr. King. However, Jeffrey Deaver knows suspense as well as little romance (between Sachs and Rhyme...will they ever get together! ). I hope he keeps writing more about this great pair! The novel is filled with wonderfully detailed descriptions and dialogue; without over-doing it. I love all the criminology work in the book and I'm thankful there is a glossary because it gave me a deeper understanding of the terms used (although, they are explained in the following sentence of where they are used). I definately recommend this book to one who enjoys suspense and detective work!"
2,Don't read this before going to bed!,"I fell asleep shortly after reading about the rats. As a result, I had a nightmare and did not sleep well. This book has some terrifying images. While I liked the idea of reading about a quad who is struggling with whether he wants to live or not..and I liked the crime scene/evidence details, I was disappointed with this book. It is poorly written. I found it hard to believe that they could solve clues so quickly. It just didn't seem realistic. The characters didn't come across as real either."
5,First in a great series,"I'm currently reading ""The Empty Chair"" and im loving it. I think it is probably the best Lincoln Rhyme yet...and to think, this was the novel that started it all.The two characters of Rhyme and Sachs are excellently drawn, and they work so well together. Lincoln Rhyme can at times be incredibly annoying, but Deaver's portrayal of him is realisitc and compelling.The plot here is excellent. I love Deaver's deadlines every few hours style of writing, and i love his twists and turns. I agree that sometimes he goes over the top with them, but they still make for a really incredible and powerful story.The way Rhyme deduces so much from such little evidence is startling...a bit unrealistic, but nonetheless adds to the enjoyment of the plot.The climax is great, really exciting. And the way Rhyme deals with the killer is ingenious!This book comes very highly reccomended."
5,A Home Run! .,"This book is the first book I have read since in college. The book took me from the minute they left the Airport!. This was a book that made me feel as if I were at the scene with the killer or the victim. This book is so discriptive in the way Deaver delivers the terror in the plot to the story and how it is described. I have all of Deavers novels and this is the best so far. Awaiting, "" The Empty Chair "" !."
5,A pageturner that keeps you guessing,"This was one of the best thriller novels I've ever read, and I've read too many to count. The plot centers around a brilliant retired police detecitve whose mind is trapped inside of a body that is paralyzed, save one finger. The detectives name: Lincoln Rhyme, and this book begins a series of novels written by Deaver with Rhyme as a central character. Amelia Sachs also appears as his beautiful, but self-doubting Watson to his Holmes. This book moves very quickly and the clues are sprinkled throughout the book in such a way that your mind never stops pondering ""Who is the Bone Collector and who is his next victim?"" This book gets good early and keeps you hooked. There is very little ""down-time, except perhaps, the sub-plot of Rhyme's planned suicide, but even that adds to the story in the end. This is the kind of book you stay up late trying to finish because you just can't go to sleep not knowing how it will end. A VERY good book."
3,Adequate but disappointing,"The book was definitely suspenseful, but there were far too many plot twists. The killer's motivation was so tormented that it was implausible, and the post-script, which was clearly the opening for the book's sequels, was so great a coincidence as to be ludicrous. I'm definitely going to have to take a break from Deaver.Additionally, it was a mistake to have this book read by a British performer. The result sounded like Sherlock Holmes came to New York, where he was incredibly patronizing."
3,didn't see the movie,"I haven't seen the movie, but I could tell reading it that it would be one. It just seemed to be paced and styled with that in mind. I didn't find this to be a particularly challenging book in any way, but it was fun and satisfying enough that I recommend it to others."
2,"In the end, an average book.","I picked up this book on a whim. I had recently finished Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lector trilogy and was looking for something along the same style. There are only four characters with personality in this book, everybody else is very generic. The dialogue is very predictable. If you've seen any action or suspense movies, you can probably guess what any character is going to say in reaction to a given situation in the book. Also, I felt that the author kind of ""dumbed down"" the text. I felt like I was reading a book I would find in a junior high library. Still, it wasn't all bad. It was good enough to not get one star. Its just a very bland predictable novel. If you're thinking of buying this, I suggest you head on over to Thomas Harris's ""Red Dragon"" instead. Its along the same lines, but is written extremely better than this one."
2,"Too violent, shallow characters","I liked Mr. Deaver's earlier books, but The Bone Collector was a disappointment to me. This author seems to have decided that handicapped heroes (his last was a deaf mute) are politically correct, and might sell books. That's because the character never rings true, rather, he seems to be a contrived product of the author's intensive research into paraplegia. Same problem with the female cop -- Deaver wants to appeal to the ""strong, independent"" woman"" crowd, but his efforts fall short. Even the violence is cliche-ridden -- the use of rats, in particular. I recommend that readers stick to earlier Deaver books and skip this one."
3,Interesting yet flat thriller,Deaver sets up an intriguing puzzle in The Bone Collector but chooses to populate the book with caricatures rather than characters. Hence we get Superdetective Lincoln Rhyme and Supermodel Amelia Sachs. Unfortunately this detracts from what should have been a dark and chilling novel. Deaver does however offer a genuinely surprising plot and an interesting and sensitive insight into the world of the quadriplegic which gives the book some backbone.
5,"Great read, the end catches you off guard","Like Deaver's ""A Maiden's Grave"", just when you think the mystery is solved and the book should be over, Deaver throws in wild twists that keep the plot moving. The characters are interesting, the style exciting, an all-around good read."
4,BONE PLEASING,"This is the second book by Deaver that I have read. May I say even though it is very good it is not quite as good as ""The Coffin Dancer"". This book seemed to be a litlle more bland. It wasn't as full of excitement and in debt thought. Even though it was lacking a few points the story line was still very, very good and the charactors seemed very life like."
4,Forensic Science is IN!,"What can I say? The beginning was a little shaky with the introduction of Amelia Sachs but after the first few pages, things really started to pick up. Rhyme, a retired quadriplegic criminalist, is at once an interesting character. He hooks you with his sharp tongue and snappy wit, using to the extent his incredible forensic knowledge. What an enlightening read!The book retains its high-strung atmosphere all the way -- right until the climatic ending! It'll keep you guessing who the perp really is ... but don't be to sure, Deaver's got many tricks up his sleeve!"
3,"Good premise, bad story",The book had the potential of being a great serial killer/cop novel but in the end relied too much on the technical aspects of working a criminal scene and not enough about the actual story. The author attempted to create a man/woman team similar to the Relic but the characters here are not that interesting and sometimes quite annoying. I found myself wondering whether I was reading a novel or a how to book on forensics. If the author just told a story and left out all the scientific jargon the book would have been much more enjoyable
4,Great read!,"Excellent story. Kept me up until I finished it. An editing error didn't pick up the difference between Calgary and Cavalry, otherwise well researched"
4,Overall Quality and Value,"I purchased the Canon ZR-50 through an online dealer for an excellent price. I also checked with Canon USA to be sure the dealer was legitimate. I received a lot of free or low-cost extras from the dealer with the camcorder e.g.extended warranty, an extended life battery, 2 tapes, a camera bag and tripod.The camera works perfectly without any of the motor noise other people have noticed. Its small size is great for travelling. The still pictures in the fine mode are satisfactory to send via the Internet.It is easy to save the still pictures from a recorded video. Printing the pictures on quality paper improves them."
1,ZR50MC need rework,"I just purchased the Canon ZR50MC and just returned the ZR50MC. I'm new to the digital format, but I expected better quality indoors under normal lighting. My purpose is taking family functions like Christmas morning, but the result would be very graining or pixilized. I did normal roomlight recording and was very disappointed with the result.In addition, the motor (scanning head?) whines. This is picked up either through the microphone or directly throught the body and is very noticable on the playback.To be sure it was the camera, I went to our largest video retailer with my tape and used other manufacturers cameras. The lighting in the store was also room light (they use a darkened area to display televisions) I played back the Canon segment followed by the other and the different was very noticable.Maybe other models do better, but I'm changing brands."
1,Video Quality is not very good,"I have compared this model with some simular models, and the video/still quality is not very good. I have since returned this model since indoors it turned white to a dirty white, and blue to gray. On the same tape with a different camcorder the image looked great. I tried all of the settings on the canon and nothing worked for me. Quality is not were it should be for a digitial camcorder."
5,"poetic nirvana, wonderful, inspirational","This is one of the best poetry books i have ever read, love has never been expressed as such, my favourite passage is""how do i love ye, its the eigth wonder of the world"", ""from its shame, the golden glow of your hair, makes the golden sun to set"", its language is delicate, its words gentle, and its meaning truly inspirational. The poetry deserves to be analyzed on two levels. On an individual level, its gentle and romantic melody take the reader to a journey of love, i read the poems over and over again, every time a different meaning was revealed inside my heart, on a spiritual level, the poetry is inspirational, speaking of higher love, the gentle words warmed my heart, and left me in a state of pure joy for hours, i have given the book to all my friends, and they have not been disappointed! give it to your loved one, they will cherish it!"
1,Terrible Waste of Time,"As a photographer, I buy a lot of books for lighting/image reference and inspiration. This book might as well be a novel, it has that few images.If you want to read about the subject of sensuality, sure pick this up. If you're after this for any other reason, don't bother. Nothing to see here. Literally."
1,EEE GADS,"This book was horrible!!! The couple fall in love at first site, they hardly speak to one another the entire book and the only love scene in it is so tame it could be rated G. There was no tension between them, no fights, no laughing...it was just plain bad!I don't know how this author keeps writing books.Don't waste your money."
1,If music was painting this would be a 3yr olds wall scribles,"The noise these ladies make would provide the perfect soundtrack to view the works of H. R. Geiger or worse. Whatever kind of 'music' comes out of this chaotic jumble of noises would be skimmed over by any SETI array searching for intelligient life. This is most likely what is pumped through the whiney, screetching P.A. system in *HELL* to make the damned claw at their own eardrums for all eternity, but to no avail.All I'm saying is that if you put on a record and all the animals within listening range flee, you know there is something wrong."
3,A MUST,"This album is tremendous. The buzz that the music is staggeringly bad is just so much urban myth. The instruments may be somewhat off-kilter but the songs and melodies are quite engaging. `PHILOSOPHY OF THE WORLD' is hypnotic. I couldn't take it off the stereo. This album has immediately lept into my top ten of all-time along with the Allmans, Soft Machine, Yes, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Kate Bush and Marvin Gaye. The Shaggs, years ahead of their time, have captured lightning in a bottle here. Enjoy."
1,Utter Dischord,"There are things in this world that are unique... defy apt description... are better left alone. The Shagg's Philosophy of the World may be one of those things.In addition to my eternal quest to encounter a Holy Grail of chick rock, I did time in New Hampshire... no way I could pass on an album by Granite State bobby-soxers. No way I could have anticipated what awaited me... a female Tiny Tim or New Creation but exuding far less harmony and appeal... a work of extraordinary antithesis to anything commercial.The opening track, Philosophy of the World, is a panorama of what unfolds throughout the entire album. A Rock Doc curio spin for sure !!"
1,you've got to be kidding me,"This is utterly horrible. It's lemon juice on paper cuts. I can't believe anyone with any intelligence could see this as ""good music"" even if for the sole reason of these girls ""expressing themselves."" This is NOT a CD for your collection. If you want to hear self-expression, give your 2-year old a box of macaroni to shake: it WILL be more entertaining."
1,holy crap...,"Oh my god. They... SUCK! I think they're playing on a rubberband instead of a guitar. I mean, dude, how did they get a record album? Or whatever. My mom would sound better then them. I could go make a band right now, of people that have never even played an instrument before and we would sound better. No wonder Foot-Foot died."
1,do not believe the hype!,"This is the biggest waste of money. Every song is unlistenable. I am a huge velvet underground fan and appreciate sonic textures, but this is garbage (that is why the album never sold in it's day). This has got to be some type of trick that someone is playing on the public because the cd is no different than if you gave 3 children instruments and just told them to start banging away. Was I ever fooled to buy this!This does not belong in anyones collection. The only person that would ever enjoy this would be a very eccentric, completely bored with the music scene music collector with moeny to waste."
1,Sound Clips Are Enough,"If you are looking at this page at Amazon then you have at least a passing interest in this odd curio in rock history. Trust me. You do NOT want this. Sure, the sound clips do entice a certain curiosity and can be quite funny. But I defy anyone to listen to a single song here in its entirety. Scrapping your fingernails across a black board will make for a much more pleasant sound. I'm sue Foot-Foot would agree."
1,"Expolitment For The Amusement Of The ""Cooler Than Thou"" Set","The story of the Shaggs is actually a sad one. Pressed on by an obsessive (some might even contend abusive) father who somehow saw his daughters as his future meal ticket, the three sisters ended up becoming an exploited ""freak show"" of sorts which hipsters and other peddlers of irony tout as an ""in joke."" Those who get it are part of the ""in crowd."" Those who find the ""music"" on the recording unlistenable and the exploitation of the sisters to separate the world into some sort of ""cool"" vs. ""not cool"" caste system offensive are dismissed as simply having pedestrian tastes.This is not about ""getting it"" or ""not getting it."" Anyone who knows a little something about the story of The Shaggs knows how they were used and manipulated through their childhood for the benefit and amusement of others. Shame on anyone and everyone who continues that exploitation today."
1,Sound Clips Will Suffice,"The hipsters can praise this all they want, but they KNOW it's crap and praising it just helps in their desperate desire to feel so smug and superior to mere mortals. I can guarantee you that few of them actually own a Shaggs album and of those that do few ever listen to it. This applied to Zappa too.Sure, it has a sincerity missing in so much of today's music, but sincerity alone does not make music (and I use the term loosely) listenable. Intrigued by this band's story? That's understanding, it is a fascinating one. But if you still feel a need to hear this stuff save yourself a lot of dough and go with the sound clips. They'll tell you everything you need to know."
5,A Philosophy of The Shaggs.,"Welcome to the alternate universe of The Shaggs! A band that goes against every concept of music. The Shaggs are like a quazi-cognizant mistake. While listening you are awakened to the magnitude of the unexplored. Our conventional notions of ""talent"" become passe, even embarrasing. Entirely new syncopations occur, inexplicably sustained. It's an instance of music created entirely under its own terms. If matter depends on anti-matter, pop must have it's anti-pop, that would be the Shaggs."
3,As Bad as it Sounds Which is Probably Good....,"The best thing about the Shaggs is that they really had no idea how terrible they really were. In fact they had somewhat of a loyal following playing dances(can you imagine) etc. in the Northeast (Vermont I think)....Anyhow this is no different than other recorded moments of lunacy such as The Legendary Stardust Cowboy, Tiny Tim, Daniel Johnson, Jandek etc. etc. it's all pretty much garbage despite what Frank Zappa thinks. Is it a total waste? No. The fact that they are totally oblivious to their ummm shorcomings almost lends it some respectability---to call it an influence though is a stretch. However there is a low fi quality to it that doesn't seem all that far removed from Guided By Voices cira. ""Bee Thousand"" so perhaps quite by accident the girls may have invented a genre. Who knows...."
3,You're missing the point,"Most of the reviews seem to be talking about these girls' sincerity and so on. But what I think Zappa loved about them, and why I laugh my guts out is that they play the way they do on purpose. Listen to the title track, for example. There is really a wonderful melody. You can recognize verses and choruses. You can pick up the structure: ABABCAB. The vocalist sings as beautifully as our president, but you can hear she doesn't even try, or rather, tries to sing out of tune.The drummer speeds up every time in same spot of the verse. And the final proof is here: when the Shaggs went to the studio, was there really no one in the studio personnel who could tune up a guitar?"
4,Folk-Punk and Fun,"I purchased Philosophy of the Word way back in the 1980's and must say it's a strange, but wonderful, trip. There is no song structure, no melody, no preconceived notions of what a song should be or not be. In other words, it's pure punk. Perphas the first punk album ever! Not punk-rock, but punk-folk. These gals surely did not know what the heck they were doing - they just played what they wanted to. Listen with an open mind and you will be transported to another dimension."
5,"Oh God, it's Aweful","People like to say 'oh that band sucks' or whatever. Well, most people don't know where the 'sucking' bar actually is. This album will set you straight. This album defines sucking. You will never scoff at Bush, Britney Spears, or N'Sync again, because they're geniuses compared to these guys.Nevertheless, 'My Pal Foot Foot', 'Who Are Parents?', and 'Philosophy of the World' are actually catchy, memorable songs. They practically bleed orginality!What's more, is that while you might think they're a big ironic joke, but they're not. In fact, this album is so bad, it's irony-proof. When one laughs at this music, you laugh not at the Shaggs, but at the experience of hearing the Shaggs.So buy it already. You will not regret it, I promise."
1,Instant Hangover,"I understand that something as bizarre as this will bring out a debate about its worth, or lack of it. And those of us that don't ""get it"" are labled philistines, but the fact that someone with a sense of humor like Frank Zappa thought it interesting and compelling really shouldn't come into play here. All these girls knew is that they were playing - sort of - their instruments, and from what I understand, coerced to do so. Remember, there is a difference between, ""so bad it's good,"" and ""just plain bad."" Just because something like ""My Pal Foot Foot"" will be tattooed on your brain after listening, doesn't make it WORTH listening to. I like the idea of keeping it around as a stocking stuffer, but it will bring on the worst hangover you've ever had within 30 seconds, irregardless if you've been drinking."
3,Interesting,"I like this album. It's amazing to me that three people banging on instruments actually have no concept of rhythm, chords, melody, etc. And that's what it sounds like - some preschool kids trying to make ""music"". There's a strange innocence and naivete about this record. Buy it, laugh, be amazed. But don't listen to it all at once, though."
5,the shaggs are better than a good laugh,"It takes awhile, but ""Philosophy of the World"" is a rare thing of beauty. 100% heart and soul! I love this album; I love the Shaggs."
5,...,"This isn't the best album of all time. Lists that can be found on the internet, like Kurt Cobain's and the Sunday Herald's, certainly overrate it. However, it certainly is a landmark album of some kind, though I don't know what movement. It's not a great album because it smells of sincerety, or because it is a joke. It works because it's a chaotic album, stretching whatever boundaries that probably existed. This is music that no one hear could seriously recreate. Their father, Andy Wiggins, insisted on recording the album because he wanted to record them while they were ""hot."" He was right. They certainly weren't cold."
4,You can never please anybody,"This album is really... something. It was recorded in one day in 1969. The Shaggs sound is hard to describe, since they don't sound like anybody else. They could barely play their instruments, and they didn't sing that well, either. But despite their technical shortcomings, their music has a certain naive charm to it. If you are only interested in music that is technically proficient, you probably won't like this album. But if you like music that is ""different"", you may get a kick out of it."
1,Hauntingly Bad,"I don't think I will ever sleep again after listening to ""My Pal's Name is Foot Foot"".I would walk across the desert while eating charcoal briquettes soaked in Tabasco for forty days and forty nights NOT to ever have to listen to anything Shagg-related EVER again.Shock therapy and all the Prozac in the world would never stop the haunting sounds of these banshees."
3,....,"this album is so bad, its hilarious.think bob geldof meets the special olympics. after i listened, i had an overwhelming urge to pat someone on the head and say ""great job!"" in a very patronizing tone.i have my doubts that they were even in the same room when this was recorded. i'd like to track down the beatnik who declared this album ""cool and avant-garde"" and punch him repeatedly.its a good laugh, but its not good."
3,grows on ya,"I think this is kinda what Syd Barrett was aiming for at his most acid-deranged. Yet being a capable musician, Syd wasn't quite able to pull it off. The Shaggs sound a bit like if Ashlee Simpson, Lindsey Lohan & Hilary Duff smoked a LOT of weed and decided to do their own version of Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica (playing all the instruments themselves). That said, the Shaggs do perform with a lot of heart and an innocence that Ashlee, Lindsey & Hilary wouldn't have. You'll hate this album at first, but after a few listens you'll inexplicably be drawn into it's bizarre world."
3,"Not a masterpiece, but not as bad as it seems","The Shaggs are notorious. It's a great story, really. Three poor girls in New Jersey in the 60's being forced to play in a band by their dad despite barely knowing how. Among the polyrythmic drum beats, the faked accents, and the nasal singing about boys and foot foot you can feel the pain of being a girl in the 60's. Granted, their musical talent is marginal at best but the songs are genuine and probably better songwriting that I could do. Also, this CD is great for breaking the ice, just play it and just about anyone will be amused or intrigued. This is not the great lost indie album, but its not as terrible as it might first appear."
4,A painful pleasure,"The Shaggs are undoubtedly the most retarded group ever put down on vinyl or CD. The only groups even comparable to this dissonant racket are the Godz (who couldn't play their instruments but sounded like they could) and Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band (they could play, but sounded like they couldn't). ""My Pal Foot Foot,"" ""My Companion"" and ""Things I Wonder"" are so appauling that that you will laugh every time you hear them. That is why you should buy this disc. The Shaggs seem free from any musical context (like verse chorus verse, for example ; or pop music), and the disc could possibly be successful just on Dorothy Wiggins enthusiasm alone. If you don't smile or laugh listening to this, then you probably don't need to buy this disc. Instead, buy the Titanic soundtrack."
1,LMAO!!!!!,"Oh...oh my god....when I listened to those samples I just had to say something. I was shocked at the number of people who thought this album 'rocked' or whatever. It's so bad...it's good. I laughed for over 3 hours listening to 'It's Halloween'....what the hell is this? Drums being played at random while the guitarist (i feel bad giving her this name) played worse then maybe my dog, while the bloody vocalist is drunk and on drugs or something! I mean come on people, what's with this stupid [stuff]?Never in my life have I heard something as bad. Never.Stay away...."
1,Oh brother!,As an answer to the praise this band has received in other reviews on this site i'd just like to make one remark: The road to hell is paved with good intentions. By saying this I mean that the sincerity of this album (or any album for that matter) should come into consideration when you want to say anything about the quality of the music. Just the fact that they really couldn't play their instruments doesn't make the record good.
1,PEEEEEW,"When did complete and utter musical ineptness become cool?[Stuff] like this and the Velvet Underground bred the ""alternative""garbage where shoegazing and lousy music became desireable.There is a reason why this and the VU sold hardly any records in their day; It stinks!"
2,Bogus,"Ok. Cut all the intellectualizing about ""what is music afterall?"" . This whole thing is a farce. Although, I find some of this recording amusing, it's a joke that wears thin after about 45 seconds. Has anyone actually ever seen the so- called ""Wiggin sisters?"" And what's with the accents? They sound like Shonen Knife singing the Carpenter's Top of The World, yet the cover photo would indicate they're Anglo girls. This whole thing (30 years ago, Frank Zappa loved them..etc.) is a big put up job. Innocents? No one could be that naive about musicality. Even if they are real and they actually recorded it, I believe it was done with the complete awareness that if they made it sound bad enough, someone might put it on a label as a joke and maybe they'd make a few bucks. More likely it's some total studio job made to sound raw and underproduced so we could all listen and wax nostalgic about the good old days before Britney and the slicksters took over."
5,One of the Best,"The Terminator holds up surprisingly well against most of the big budget stuff made today. It's dark tones, rapid pace, and terrifically appropriate music make it a landmark in the action/sci-fi genre. Buy it!"
3,Blu-Ray Governator?,Classic movie which is very enjoyable. My only concern is that I really don't see any real viewing improvement in the Blu-Ray version over the standard DVD. Perhaps this is due to the fact that much of the film occurs in relative darkness so it appears a bit grainy. Probably not worth the extra expense to buy Blu-Ray over the standard DVD.
3,"excellent 5 star movie , inferior one star blu ray transfer.","This is a true classic of the sci fi genre. a five star movie classic, That being said Warner Brothers made no attempt to clean up the print for the blu ray release. This was a early release from the studio on the new format. They since have released many flicks with excellent cleaned up pictures. However sony also made this mistake with their release of the fifth element and then recalled the first edition and put out a proper cleaned up release. Warner brothers needs to do the same with this one. Lets just hope that no other movies get released on blu ray with tear and wear lines down the center of the picture. 'caligula' has them too sadly but that's a special case, Blu ray should never have such poorly done transfers on this format. Even the newer release of this is just the same print. this is lame. Someone clean this movie up! they fixed 'predator' so why can't they do the same for this and 'robocop""?"
5,I'll be back,"The phrase ""I'll be back"" conjures up pretty much one image in today's world; yes that of the first of the Terminator series of movies.Night time, wind and electricity swirl around and the appetence of a naked Anry (Arnold Schwarzenegger.) Frightening in its self but only a taste of what is to come. It seems that he is invincible and is targeting all the Sara Connors in the phone book. Each one being dispatched more violently than the last. A less robust being (Michael Biehn) also appears the same way. He too is seeking Sara.What is so intriguing about Sara Connors (Linda Hamilton)?Who will find her first?What effect can the outcome have on humankind?I thought Arnold's accent added to the character of the movie. It is the way one says ""I'll be back"" that adds the threat."
2,"Great movie, really bad Blu-Ray transfer!","Really good movie. But the transfer to Blu-Ray is really poor. I own many Blu-Ray titles (also the DVD version of this), this is one of the worse Blu-ray transfers I've seen, quality wise. Lots of grain, and not just during the darker scenes (you will see this immediately at the start). For the life of me I cannot understand how relatively modern era movies like Terminator (1984) could have quality issues like this in Blu-Ray, while older films in Blu-Ray like Battle of the Bulge (which I also have) look far, far superior image-wise.I regret purchasing this Blu-Ray disc, my current DVD version would have sufficed. I really hope they come up with a better, truly HD restored version of this otherwise great sci-fi classic."
1,Terminator,"I agree with some other reviewers--for a blu-ray edition the picture is awful. I watched the upconverted standard DVD edition on the same blu-ray equipment and LCD TV and the picture is as good if not better. My question is, what is the reference point for the 300+ people who gave this DVD a 5-star rating?"
2,NOT YOUR REGULAR BLU RAY,"I don't know what happened here but my copy of the blu-ray version of The Terminator looks just like regular old dvd quality to me. It is not terrible but not nearly as sharp as every other blu-ray disc I've watched with my system, the picture is just soft, not quite as good as a good regular dvd transfer watched with a first rate standard dvd player. Somebody was either asleep at the switch or trying to pull a fast one to make a few bucks, although I fail to see how it makes any sense."
5,Arnold's best flick ever.,"Simply put this was Arnold's best action flick ever. The story, acting, special effects are all superb for a movie that was released in 1984. Terminator 2 was also a great movie, but moreso for the incredible (at least for 1991) special effects, and not as much for the story. Basically Terminator and T2 are both AWESOME movies, but T1 was better, even if the special effects look dated nearly 20 years later.Buy this DVD, and T2. You won't be dissapointed."
1,I didn't like The Terminator.,I thought The Terminator was the worse movie I have ever seen. Terminator 2 has great special effects than this one. This one was terrilbe and I didn't really like it. I just can't beleive I wasted my money to buy this on video. The reason why I brought it because I wanted to have both Terminator movies. I think the second one is the best.
4,The Weakest Terminator Movie But Good Anyway,T1 Is Pretty Good But The Effects Need A Little Work But Overall The Movie Is A B+
4,Arnold=machine,"I saw the 2nd Terminator before the first one,and when I saw the first one my sisters didnt like it,but I did, my sisters like the 2nd and 3rd one but some reason they dont like this one that much.Arnold is a machine that trys to kill the mother of General John Conner.In future and a soldier protects Sarah from the Terminator.Can Kyle Reese protect Sarah and stop the Terminato, find out and watch this."
1,Why isn't the DVD anamorphic????,"I loved this film in the theaters, but until/unless the widescreen DVD is released in anamorphic format, I'm boycotting it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!!!!!,"Why in the hell would they release this copy of Terminator without any bonus material if they released one 6 years ago with bonus material. My way of thinking was to buy the most resent copy that has come out, which in a world with logic and common sense would be the superior copy. I would be wrong. Its my fault for not being more thorough with my search, but its still doesn't make sense that they would downgrade the newest release of the DVD. Oh well. Its still a great movie regardless."
4,It was very entertaining,"I had not seen this movie for many years.. so many, that I totally forgot what the movie was all about... my son, who is 14 years, has been wanting to watch the saga for a while but since these movies are rated R, I didn't feel comfortable letting him watch them. So my husband and I decided that we would allow him to watch the saga as long as we all watch them together. My son loved the first movie and could not wait to see the rest. In my case, it felt like watching a brand new movie. Likewise, I cannot wait for saturday, our movie night. Thanks Amazon for keeping old movies available."
3,A lot of dust in certain scenes (Blu-Ray version),"A number of scenes looks like there was a lot of dust on the glass -- the particles were stationary which was very distracting. I can't believe just how little they cared about the transfer.The sound and picture quality is way better than the DVD version. Sound has been added to the rear speakers which enhances the audio.For me, it was worth the seven dollars but because of the annoying dust, I wouldn't pay anymore than that."
5,The Terminator,"Lots of action from beginning to end. If you love an action film, this is for you!Schwarzenegger was a perfect pick to play this character."
5,"Great Movie, But Get The Surround Sound Version","What can I say? ""The Terminator"" is a classic (best of the 3, if you ask me), but the audio choices with this item are extremely limited. Hold out for the surround sound version, if you've got the hardware fot it."
4,"Arnold gets my vote for a 4th Terminator film, not a 2nd term","A cyborg from the future (Arnold Schwartzeneggar) and a human soldier (Michael Biehn) travel back in time to battle over the life of a woman (Linda Hamilton) whose son will one day lead the human rebellion. This classic SF action picture put both Schwartzeneggar and writer/director James Cameron on the map, and rightfully so. The script is efficient and lean, moving effortlessly from thrill to thrill with not a wasted scene in between action set pieces. This film was clearly made on a budget, but the effects hold up well, even today./"
4,Classic SF,"I can't say anything more about the film than has already been said. It is great fun. The DVD while good suffers from the lack of director commentary track. Considering the ""guerilla movie making"" involved, this would have been a wonderful opportunity to gain insight into the making of this film. Though the dual documentaries offers some insight, I would have welcomed Cameron providing intimate details of making this film. Otherwise, the sound and video quality are very high."
4,it'll be back in my movie collection.,"The Terminator is considered one of the greatest action movies of all time...and not just by me...well, by me too but...... anyway it's a really greast movie and should be watched again and again."
4,Great Fun,I'd forgotten that this film was a bit scary. A slightly different tack than different films in the series.Some interesting extras and making of films.
2,Theater Mono - On a DVD ? - keep your VHS if you have it,"I can't believe it, this movie on DVD has the original sound that it did in 1984 - what gives? This of all movies should be in Dolby Digital. My advice is to keep your VHS copy. If you don't have a VHS then you may as well get the DVD - just don't expect any spectacular sounds"
1,Did NOT receive the Lenticular edition,"Although I purchased the Lenticular edition, I received the regular DVD.The PROOF OF PURCHASE code on the case is 1001182, which is for the regular DVD.The UPC sticker that is taped to the plastic wrap has the Lenticular edition code, but the case itself has the UPC code for the regular DVD of 00027616854735.I'm asking Amazon for a refund of the price difference of $5.50."
3,"After reading this, look at the review ""What Gives"" comments for more info!","Bottom line, it looks like, if the one person truely did get the ""Special Edition"" with the lenticular slip case, then MGM, or whomever did this last distrubution, mixed the lenticulars with both editions. I gave 3 stars, not for the Great movie, but because of the screwed up distribution! Shame, for shame!"
5,Still Arnie's Best,"This is a movie that confused me a bit as a child, but upon viewing it another time, I couldn't get enough of it. If you're an action fan, then this movie has everting. Great one-liners, car chases, fights, and murder and futuristic mayhem. In 1984, two men[Michael Biehn and Schwarzennegar] appear out of nowhere, both are from the future, and both have one goal, find Sarah Connor. This is Arnie's best role still to date, although he doesn't talk much. He starts out the movie with a bang, naked in kicking some street punk's asses, and stealing their clothes in the process. He proceeds to find as much ammo as possible, and track down Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton. Hamilton delivers a good performance as a young woman frightened out of her wits. Director James Cameron does an excellent job putting the film together, and I found it hard to believe that this was only his second Hollywood film. Its a fun, suspenseful movie to watch!"
4,great movie,"even though the end scene is really crappy looking (i mean it was stop motion) it was a great 80's movie. the special edition looks really cool with the new scenes and the new 5.1 sound. so at least we don't have to deal with horrible sound. alse MGM sudios is releasing it instead of Hemindal entertainment. i just hope they fully restored the picture also. Warning to parents: there is a love scene around an hour and 10 min in with some nudity. just to let them knowRated R for graphic violence, strong language and brief nudity involving sex"
4,"""I'll be back.""","That line said by Arnold Schwarzenegger himself in James Cameron's ""The Terminator"" has become one of those classic movie cliches. The movie itself is an original and frightening action/thriller with a dark, grainy look and an '80s feel to it. The scene in the Technoir gives me chills. It moves in slow motion, then becomes fast and explosive. This film made Arnold a star, and he was born to play the ""Terminator"". He's chilling, realistic, and scary. At first, he didn't want to play this character of an emotionless cyborg, but after reading the script, he did. It's the role he will be remembered for for years to come."
4,The Terminator,Arnold can't get any better. He has done many and many films but The Terminator series takes the cake as Arnold gets sent back from time to face Sarah Connor. He tracks her down and trys to kill her but John from the future sents Kyle Reese John's father to save her from Arnold. As Arnold gets crushed and dies Sarah gets locked up and brakes free in Terminator 2 and must face the T-1000. Two more releases of Terminator 3 and Terminator 4 to be released. As I said in the Terminator 2 review in Terminator 3 Arnold must face a female T-1G in Terminator 3 and as now Arnold an't making any plans for Terminator 4.
4,One of the best,"Terminator is a merciless thriller that surpasses the over-hyped sequel. The atmospheric feel of this movie is really intense! The first 60 minutes of this movie are excellent, the atmospheric feel is wild, but as the movie unravels it sort of loses it's edge. Just the atmospheric intensity of the first hour gives this movie 4 stars."
3,Where's my special features?,"I own this lenticular edition. The slip cover is very nice, I love it. But my copy only has these special features:-Trailer-DVD-Rom Script to Screen.Is it normal for this edition?"
4,Just a bare bones disc.,"Got this (Along with T2 Extreme) about a month back. When I opened it up I was greeted with a lenticular card glued onto the plastic wrap for the 2006 release. Naturally I was irritated with this absolutely stupid move by MGM to re-release films with no Special Features (And in the case of blu-ray, do an improper upscale that looks no better than DVD.).The film? Oh it was great, the quality was real nice too. Probably the only good thing about a DVD without any special features.And a quick note, the case was one of those econo-crappy cases with the big gaps in the plastic to ""Save the environment"". I love the environment and all but I hate these cases. They feel so cheap and flimsy. I might just swap a different case out."
4,"""One of Sci-Fi & Arnold's Best!""","Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehnstar in James Cameron's 1984 sci-fi film. A future soldiertravels back in time to protect a woman from a cyborgassassin. This is one of sci-fi and Arnold's best. Thisdvd has good picture and sound plus cool extras. Getthis 80's classic."
1,"Horrible Sound, Disgrace of the meaning dvd","The movie is great but the DVD version was very disapointing considering it is in Mono. They claim that in the movies it was not in stereo either but with the technology of today they definitely have to re-release this title in with new sound. It is out in other regions, why cant they do it here? I went crazy to find this title new but was lucky enough to get it used at funcoland for 19.99 and it was disapointing"
3,remastered edition is on the way !,"A new re-mastered edition has been announced by MGM/UA and should be available February 19th, 2013.Therefore you might want to buy the previous edition only if you care more on the price than on the quality."
3,Classic,Updating my movie collection is something I have been working on for some time. Getting Terminator on Blu-ray is a great addition.
3,Buyer beware they do not send out special editions.,"The DVD is new but it's not special edition, therefore it's falls advertising. Hope this review helps everyone."
2,Blu ray version needs to be remastered,"This is a great movie, however blu ray shows a lower then expected resolution and it feels - especially in the opening scene like the studio did not try and remaster the negatives so you see all these old artifacts showing up on the film. Until its remastered for blu ray and cleaned up so its presentable in this format just stick with the DVD version."
3,"Great movie, video not from an HD source","The Terminator is one of the great action movies of our time. That's not what this review is about.This review is about the video quality of this Blu-ray disc. The menus are fantastic 1080p resolution, but the actual movie looks as though it was pulled from the same source used for the DVD, which may as well have been the same source they used for VHS so long ago.The movie is a fantastic one, but I'd say to save your money and get the standard definition DVD since the picture quality is about the same."
4,Deleted scenese are the best feature,"The transfer of this film is beautiful. I can finally toss my VHS copy. The features are the reason we're purchasing this one. There are 2 well made documentaries but the first thing you will want to check out are the delted scenes. This is what makes the dvd worth it. There are only 6 segments. Each feature commentary from James Cameron. You only wish he did commentary on the film. The scenes are too short to get in real insight into the film from the commentaries. The final deleted scene is really an alternative ending. This edition is 1 dvd but there are materials on both sides. Cool, now-standard animated menus."
2,Sound quality is poor,nothing spectacular about this dvd. sound track is in mono. no special features. i suggest you spend your money on a production that offers more value for the dollar.
5,Excellent Movie,"Something about it being an older movie, perhapes the way the film looks, makes this movie truly scary. Not scary like all the spiders attacking people in today's current movies but something more.Terminator II is a good movie for its effects, but Terminator I is the scariest movie, as well as the best one."
3,The music,"This movie is great,fun,cool and exiting.But when it comes to the music..a wait leat me refrase that ahhh WHAT MUSIC,the music they used in this movie is just midi files and that **** me off. If it haden't been for crapie music this movie would have been perfect.This tekst refers to the vhs version."
4,Wish it didn't have so much nudity...,"Perhaps one of the most popular series, ""The Terminator"" is the most powerful independent film I have ever seen, but like most independents it has its ups and downs. I wish I never saw the seen with Arny in full nude and Sarah with Kyle. However, these are qualities I see in movies all the time, so never mind. This movie is packed full of action and a strong plot. I would suggest action-movie-lovers buy this movie. I wish I could, but I'm only 13."
3,Terminatorr,The DVD froze in a couple of spots and it may have some scratches. It also could have been the interaction with the DVD player. I fixed the problem but I amdissapointed that a new print would have these problems.
2,Terminator,"I did not get the product advertised, it was NOT a special edition copy. It was the regular version."
3,Kind of for the die-hard but still not a bad print.,"OK, it's a sad fact that not all Blu-Ray's are created equal. I'm sure many of you have gotten to the point where you ask yourself why did I bother. Sadly, this may be one of those occasions. Although the picture is not horrible don't expect to much detail reveiled."
5,A classic that everyone should own.,"If you've never seen this film, you're missing one of the greatest movies of our times, it's classic sci-fi future time travellers from the destroyed world, coming back to right the wrongs of the past. It has some interesting twists and turns during the movie, I would recommend that you pick this up today."
4,Terminator never looked so good!,"Classic Movie on Bluray, Must have for any fan of the series. Butt kicking,Cyborgs, and good ole Action Movie Awesome-ness! You cant ask for nothing better."
3,terminator blu ray/dvd,good movie for its time on my 60' tv and my oppo picture and sound good but not great!but for the money cant complain
5,The Terminator,"Long before Arnold had a gubernatorial gleam in his eye, he starred as a hulking, monotone killing machine in this electrifying sci-fi action thriller by ""Titanic"" director Cameron. Popping off some of the most famous one-liners in film history (""Hasta la vista, baby!""), Schwarzenegger is both frightening and funny, even as he brutally destroys anyone who interferes with his mission. Hamilton and Biehn handle their roles splendidly too, with credible intensity, fear, and against-all-odds resolve. Full of dazzling special effects and far better than its buffed-up sequels, ""The Terminator"" is a hellish, suspense-fueled fun ride into the future."
2,"Did He Indeed ""Come Back""...?","It was with some dissatisfaction that I began to watch Terminator on my PS3 and 45"" Vizio. First, I had to double-check and indeed make sure this was a Blu-Ray and not a VHS recording. Serious - the film quality is stuck with the plot... in the 80's. The sound was not that impressive either when running through a pretty darn good 5.1 system. And to top it all off, the Special Features best aspect is a decent range of subtitles. At the end of the day, when Arnold promises to be back, it seems he didn't bring the quality content with him.So, the movie itself is a classic, we all know that. And occasionally I enjoy the old school grainy pictures. But this is to date the worst Blu-Ray I have seen. It looks better when watching it on cable. Seriously. Stick with the DVD. Even paying $10 for this is more than a bit aggravating."
1,DVD is NOT Special Edition,"The movie is a great classic.The 1 star is for Amazon and the seller advertising deceitfully. Check out the 4 pics of the front covers. 2 do not have Special Edition on the cover and do not include the features of the SE. Instead it's just as a standard old DVD with the theatrical trailer only. These 2 should not have been included with the SE advertisement.When I read through the sellers profiles, only one stated that theirs was NOT the SE. Apparently they were the only honest seller in the list!"
2,Just Buy The Standard DVD,"Having just purchased a Blu-Ray I was mortified when I popped this movie in. What the heck, where is that superb, almost life like imagery? Come to find out, they only upscaled the standard video. A real disappointment and a really misleading product. At least I didn't pay alot of money for it.Let's hope this doesn't become a trend."
3,this guy is so wrong it makes my head hurt,"""Im not sure if anyone knows that this film was never shot in high def so its not really a high def movie.A film has to be shot in hd or its not an hd movie.A lot of people will not understand this but your being duped""""Its upconverted and thats all.""Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong...wrong.Film has more resolution than ""HD"" but it must be properly transfered to digital form, then properly encoded on the HD disc (Blu Ray). Either this disc was poorly encoded or the digital HD master made from the film elements was done poorly. Most people believe the fault lies in the encoding process, mostly because 25g may not be big enough for a proper mpeg2 encode, which is a very outdated codec at this point."
1,THIS IS NOT THE Special Edition DVD !!!!,Movie 5 Stars no question.!!!!!!!But Hey AMAZON. Thats not the special Edition you selling!I bought this DVD about the specials. And? - I became a DVD without specials. THANKS !&$&%&/
5,I'll be back,"The phrase ""I'll be back"" conjures up pretty much one image in today's world; yes that of the first of the Terminator series of movies.Night time, wind and electricity swirl around and the appetence of a naked Anry (Arnold Schwarzenegger.) Frightening in its self but only a taste of what is to come. It seems that he is invincible and is targeting all the Sara Connors in the phone book. Each one being dispatched more violently than the last. A less robust being (Michael Biehn) also appears the same way. He too is seeking Sara.What is so intriguing about Sara Connors (Linda Hamilton)?Who will find her first?What effect can the outcome have on humankind?I thought Arnold's accent added to the character of the movie. It is the way one says ""I'll be back"" that adds the threat.Terminator 2: Judgment Day [Blu-ray]"
1,It is not DTS version,"The web description say it is DTS version. When I order, I just receive a dolby 5.1 version. Since I am not in US, does Amazon provide subsidize of postage? It is cheat."
2,Old movie in new tech,"The movies the same but the Blue Ray is not needed. It was not shot at this high a quality. The regular DVD would be fine.After seeing this again, I much preferred Bourne Identity. I just didn't remember T1 robot being clay-mation..."
4,I'll be back (in 1991 that is),The first Terminator is not as good as the epic sequel that was made some years later. The plot is simple and this is still a fan fave and a cult sci-fi film.
3,Terrible Sound,"I don't understand who is in charge of soundtracks for DVD's. I just finished watching Dead Presidents and it has one of the best soundtracks I heard in terms of bass, spaciial sound and rear surround. So here is this special edition and the sound is barely audible. Dead presidents was made in 1995 and sounds better than half the DVD's I own made in 2000! I would think a special edition would be special. The movie, picture and specials are fantastic but I bet all will be dissappointed with the audio"
4,The best hero,"Some people from the future, who wants change the history to save all the human's life is the best hero of the world."
2,Not Special Edition,"Advertised as special edition... yea rite... got the regular edition instead, and other customers have written that as well, i shoulda listened and gone to store and bought in person... Amazon needs to check their sellers, cuz it's false advertisement and deception... the movie is gud and very entertaining, but not having the special features sucks... shame on u Amazon."
2,That's all?,What I got was a bare-bones release with a new cover. The only special feature was a trailer. Very disappointing.
1,This ia NOT SPECIAL EDITION!!!,I am a collector and wanted a special edition version of this movie. It was stated that this was that. It was NOT. I was very upset!
3,What gives?,"I just wanted to state that I got this Edition but it dosen't have,--""Other Voices"" documentary with new James Cameron Interviews--""The Terminator: A Retrospective"" documentary--""Terminated"" deleted scenes w/ commentary from James Cameronon my copy, what gives?"
1,Terrible On Blu-Ray,"Don't waste your money purchasing this film on blu-ray like I did. Restoration is needed for this film, and it should never have been released in the blu-ray format. Be cautious when buying those old favorite films in blu-ray. If the packaging doesn't make any mention of the films restoration then don't buy it."
3,First movie,"Frankly, the first terminator movie is kind of bad. It is a great addition to a movie collection, but not as good as the rest of the franchise."
3,The Terminator,"Great movie. Beautiful Blu-ray picture. But the sound was not so good. Explosions were muffled, gun fire was too quiet and the music did not boom through. The disc was priced well enough, but I would have paid more for a great sound track."
3,Good Introduction to the Franchise,"The original terminator would not say is the greatest sci-fi movie ever but nonetheless a decent introduction to the franchise. It is pretty interesting and the sci-fi effects are good but of course nothing like T-2. I know that the sci-fi movie business was just getting going in the mid 80's so I am not criticizing the movie on behalf of that. If your a fan of the terminator movies and have not seen it be sure to do so but otherwise look towards T-2, or T-3 for a more impressive sci-fi viewing experience.Peter J. Miller"
4,Blu-Ray Technical Specs,"The Terminator [Blu-ray]Feature film Blu-Ray technical specifications:Video: 1080p, 1.85:1Audio:* English Uncompressed PCM 5.1* English Dolby Digital EX 5.1* French Dolby Digital EX 5.1I'm hopeful that Amazon's technical specifications listings will become more useful."
5,great movie,we watch it with our son and now he is 28 years old. Now my grandson is watching the same movie and loving it. He says the Terminator is the best.
2,This is Blu-Ray Review not a review of the movie itself,In my mind when you are just slapping dvd auality on to a Blu-ray disk you are false advertising and ripping the public off. No one needs or wants a blu-ray film simply for the disk itself but they want a better movie. Sure they have the uncompressed audio but the picture quality sucks. If you have the DVD keep it and foget this.Great movie poor Blu-ray port
2,Bad dvd,"My wife loved this movie, eventhought the acting seen bad now compare to then. Like the 300 movie, not as much, this movie starting to stop working and freezing. IM not sure if it is my new sony 550 BD or just that I bought both movies on the Amazon website. I will have to buy another BD somewhere else to see."
2,Not good copy,"I expected a remastered copy but it was a film copy, you can see the scratch from the original film. Its the same to buy the old DVD o VHS."
3,Prelude to Terminator II,"Not that good in my opinion. When I saw this movie back in 1990 I was blown away. But right now in 2000's, I viewed again and I can tell this movie is indeed made 19 years ago. My favorite part is still the car chase through Los Angeles. It's getting there, but still not great"
5,Perfect Blu-Ray Transfer,I am reviewing the Blu-Ray quality not the movie as everyone knows what Terminator is all about.Ok I have to say this is a Perfect Transfer for a 1980s movie on B-Ray.Picture is so real it felt like they made it 2 months ago. (There was only 2 picture greyness when Arnie is in the hotel room Patching his eyeball and at the end when he gets blown up in the truck and transforms in the cyborg. I guess not much can be done there especially when it's a Model.Apart from that 100% perfect picture and not to mention the sound: much sharper then the special edition DVD which had some faults.Only Down side that I have to say is where is the Special Edition Terminator 2 Blu-Ray????Blu-Ray is supposed to be the ultimate in storage capability and yet they still con us. I bought T2 thinking it was the uncut version but was shocked to see it was the normal movie Yuck what a big con. (Please release the uncut version)
4,High Fidelity may not be a good thing,"Audio and video are crisp. May be too crisp, such that the original low budget nature of the movie becomes distractingly apparent. The machines are obvious movie set models. The surround effects and some of the gun shots are clearly added post production-they just don't sound natural (the surround effects especially sounded like a 200X remix, compared to the original mono sound mix of this 198X movie). Somehow the higher fidelity actually took me out of the movie. But still a good movie."
1,Biiiiig mistake,"I saw this blu-ray on sale, and though I normally just rent on netflix, I thought this was a ""must-have"" and I bought it. BAD MOVE! The picture quality looks so low-def I almost don't believe it's a blu-ray disc. I couldn't watch more than 15 minutes of it, and I never do that.I put in my previous Terminater DVD, and I couldn't believe it! The picture was better on the DVD, and it had way more special features too! Even though I paid fifteen dollars for it for the new edition, I STILL FEEL RIPPPED OFF!!!!!!It feels like they just jumped on the blu-ray bandwagon making this and rushed into it. Cheaply!Purchase at your own risk (you'll regret it.....)."
4,Judgement war is near...,"I like this movie. It may not have as good or as realistic andgrippling technology as the sequel, but it's worth whatching.I especially like the dark and cold future, a world led by machines that slaughter the human opposition. It would be realistic if the date was only sat a little further, like 2140-something, becous I do not believe that it takes 5 years to biuld a super-self-thinking/race-expanding computer."
2,A Total RIPOFF!!!,"I think Sony or WHOEVER released this alleged blu ray should be held liable for misrepresentation!! THIS DISC HAS NO BLU RAY QUALITIES, WHATSOEVER. It may SAY blu ray on the case, but the viewing quality is definitely, undeniably, DVD. I own the DVD version, and was preparing for a visual treat from the highly touted blu ray. Boy, was I let down hard! Matter of fact, the blu ray doesn't even have Spanish as an audio choice, while my other DVD DOES. What gives?On the cover of the disc, you see Arnold with the one red eye. The other is winking because he knows you been a complete sucker for buying this ""blu ray""."
2,Cash Grab Release!,"This is the fourth release of this film on blu-ray already. There is the 2006 original, a 2009 lenticular cover version, a 2010 blu-ray/DVD combo and now this 2011 blu-ray book. While I won't debate the merits of the film itself, MGM is currently in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings and I assume this is the primary reason for this new release. Unfortunately, they haven't bothered upgrading the original MPEG-2/LPCM 2006 mastering of the film itself; all the versions contain identical disc content. If you don't already own this film and want a fancy book style package for a 5 year old blu-ray master, go ahead and pick this up. Otherwise, you're better off finding a less expensive older version."
1,FANTASTIC Movie! Horrible DVD.,"I am one of the biggest fans of this movie (saw it many times in the theatre when it was released, bought the soundtrack on LP, have almost everything about it), and it IS one of the BEST Sci-Fi movies ever made - especially for its small budget. That said, this is one of the worst DVDs I've seen. The only special feature you get is ONE original trailer. No ""Making Of"" (which I have the VHS version of), No commentary tracks (come on James Cameron! Get with it! I love your movies and would love to hear your comments!), not even any other language or subtitle tracks - nothing spectacular on this DVD at all. I'm personally glad I have it because I'm a true collector of everything Terminator, but I can't recommend it for people who want more out of it. There really isn't much here in the DVD package - a waste of all that storage space."
5,A classic,The best movie ever. The whole family really enjoys this movie. Download download this movie. I recommend this to anyone
5,Great movie,"Considering it was filmed in 1984 and was the first movie directed by John Cameron it is terrific. Honestly, I don't know how the movie got green lighted. ""Cyborg Robot from the future is transported back in time to ensure that nuclear war....""If I were a studio executive hearing that script, I would have said they were nuts.Truly a classic movie...."
3,"Great Movie, Poor DVD","The Terminator is undoubtedly a great movie, with lots of violence, a unusual amount of shot people, especially cops (in the famous police station scene), and also one of the last chances to see Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the ""bad guy/ciborg"". With a very imaginative plot by director James Cameron, this film and it's sequels (specially ""Terminator 2"", which in my opinioon is the best action movie EVER made), are great fun to watch.However, I was very dissapointed with this DVD, as it has almost no special features whatsoever, except for the original trailer and some crappy dvd-rom feature. Shame on MGM to release such a poor DVD version of this great movie."
3,Could Of Been Better,wow where do i start on this one ? to start off if your a terminator fan like i am this is the best copy your gonna find out there..HEY what do you want from an older movie?the video was grainy but was good in some spots.audio was really good thru HDMI connection and had really good surround sound..thats all i can say about this movie...not a good movie to satart off blu ray with....P.S.cant wait for my copy of T2 to get here
4,The Terminator looks great in High Definition!,"Although not my favorite movie, This movie is awesome when viewed in 1080p high definition! This Blu Ray movie was well worth the price difference over the regular 480i standard DVD! What a great buy!"
5,Action rules,"I love this movie. It just gets right into the action at the beginning and I love that. Not the best of the trilogy series, but still great."
5,The best film ever made!,"I bought this dvd because its my favourite film of all time, the picture is not perfect and the sound is in mono,but never mind MGM are releasing a Special Edition early 2001 with Anamorphic picture, 5.1 Digital sound and other extras,should be worth the wait."
1,"""MUST READ BEFORE BUYING THIS TERMINATOR DVD""","WARNING-RIPOFF, WARNING-RIPOFF!!! IN 2001 MGM RELEASED A BARE BONES TERMINATOR DVD WHICH CAME IN A CRAPPY LOOKING CASE. THIS DVD RELEASE IS ALSO FROM MGM. WHAT MGM DID IS THEY TOOK THEIR 2001 TERMINATOR DVD CASE AND HOT GLUED A THIN TERMINATOR HOLOGRAM TO THE FRONT OF IT!!!! WHAT YOU GET IS THE EXACT SAME THING AS MGM'S 2001 RELEASE. SAME MGM BARE BONES DVD, SAME CRAPPY LOOKING CASE. ALL YOU WILL BE DOING IS SPENDING $14.98 FOR A THIN CRAPPY TERMINATOR HOLOGRAM. MGM TRIED TO TRICK PEOPLE THROUGH AMAZON.COM BY CHANGING THE LOOK OF THE DVD CASE TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS WAS A NEW TERMINATOR DVD RELEASE WITH CONTAINED DELETED FOOTAGE, INTERVIEWS, AND REAL SPECIAL FEATURES. WRONG, ITS THE SAME BARE BONES DVD THAT MGM RELEASED IN 2001!!!IF YOU ALREADY OWN THE 2001 MGM TERMINATOR DVD THEN DON'T BUY THIS!!!! YOU WILL ONLY BE RE-BUYING THE A DVD YOU ALREADY OWN!!!"
5,New Great Terminator Remaster Is Here!!!! Get Region-Free from Amazon.UK,"I just ordered a brand-new Remastered Terminator (NOT THIS ONE HERE) from Amazon.UK for a total of $20.48 US dollars (includes 6-8 day standard shipping).I'm a cheap bastard that usually insists on waiting until I can find what I want for $10 or less...but not this time!Merry Christmas to me!!!It's Region Free, so it should work OK in U.S. BTW...UK reviews on this remaster are very enthusiastic.Don't wait until U.S. release in February 19th (according to Blu-Ray.com)Get it now!Here's the link to the promised land!http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003BNY6YY/ref=ox_ya_os_productUPDATE: I just watched my new copy (NOT THIS ITEM HERE) from Amazon UK and it is AWESOME!I give it a 4 stars for picture quality and 4 stars for sound quality. (pretty good for a movie from the early 80's)Impress your friends...Give it to the Home Theater buff in your life!"
4,"Cyborgs don't feel pain. You shouldn't either, buying this disc...","I don't usually review DVD/Blu-Ray releases, but I wanted to note that the Blu of Terminator makes for a nice companion piece with the T2 Skynet Edition, and is a good watch in its own right. I read a lot of reviews saying that the video looks bad, and while it could have been cleaned up and remastered, it looks fine for what it is. Remember that it's a 20 year-old movie that was shot on a relatively low budget, and that much of it is supposed to look rough and gritty anyway. Even saying that, the depth and clarity were nice, and the soundtrack/effects were a blast! Unless/Until a new version of the movie comes out (how many times was T2 re-released?!), and if you can get it for around $10, I'd say buy it."
1,Blu-rayp off!!!,"One word - disappointment. FIRST, let me just say that this is not a review about the plot of the movie, like most reviews here appear to be. This is about video and audio quality the way a BLU RAY movie should be. The video quality is terrible; audio was nominal at best. In fact, the DVD version on a standard DVD player and tube TV looks better. It reminded me of how the VHS version looked after I bought my first DVD player. I got it for $13 at BestBuy but I don't even think it was worth even that. Do not buy this; keep or buy the DVD version."
5,Good and Good For You!,"Every Day I Pray is a wonderful collection of prayers for many situations we all find ourselves in. I have been on a dedicated search to find a way to incorporate prayer into every aspect of my life, and am so thankful I found Iyanla Vanzant's books. Thank you Iyanla for putting into words that EVERYTHING we do/say/think is noticed by God and we should give it all to Him/Her in thanks. I especially like that Iyanla writes God as He/She, Him/Her, as I believe God to be a duality of both the male and female. God Bless and I hope you find what you need in this lovely book."
3,Great film but...,"I know they now have the Blu Ray version that has the documentary in it, perhaps the one I saw back when it came out on TV to promote the film but this DVD version does not. It has both pan and scan and widescreen but this version is missing two bits of film from the VHS version that I remember. When Treece finds his buddy Kevin he puts his coat over the body and then hugs him which is touching. Later in the underwater climax Nolte uses the suction device's exaust to stun the big black henchman dude to escape but the full scene is missing just like the hugging scene.This movie needs a full blown remaster to fix everything I would guess but the sales are not there to warrant the money it would take I would imagine.I also read that there is an extended version that was shown on TV years ago. That should be done as well and I would buy it for sure because I love this movie.I bought the VHS and two DVD's so far plus I saw the film in the theatre."
4,Good Movie,"I realize that memory is a fickle thing and is has been several years since I last saw this movie, but it seems that some scenes are missing."
2,No widescreen copies anywhere?,"I bought a copy online, but returned it when I found it was fullscreen only. I thought it would be like the version I rent from my local store - fullscreen on one side, anamorphic widescreen on the other. It doesn't look like a single seller here is selling a widescreen version. To find it, I may have to look elsewhere."
3,LET ME TELL YA...,LET ME TELL YOU THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THIS DVD IS BECAUSE IM A HUGE FAN OF DONNA SUMMER. AND THE THEME FROM THE DEEP IS PERFORMED BY DONNA. A DANCE AND A SLOW VERSION. THIS MOVIE IS MOST WATCHABLE.
5,The Deep,Great scenery of Bermuda. Good movie especially if you're a diver. Found the extra commentary to be interesting. I would recommend this.
4,A classic for anyone that likes diving,"""The Deep"" was one of the reasons I started diving back in the 80's. Since then I have bought this movie in VHS, DVD and now Blu-Ray. The Dlu-Ray edition is worth the price, with an amazing image quality and nice extras. A must for anyone who loves diving, adventure or Jaqueline Bisset..."
2,This DVD is missing some footage,"There is a scene in this film wherein Robert Shaw's character, Romer Treece, discovers the body of a friend strung up in a shed, gently lowers it to the floor, and covers the body with his coat. Treece, overcome with grief, then drops to his knees and hugs his friend's lifeless body. On this DVD, the scene ends after Treece covers the body with his coat. The footage that is supposed to follow is missing from both the widescreen and full screen presentations on this disc, so viewers don't get to see a very powerful and emotional moment. Also, this DVD is a no-frills release, with just the widescreen version on one side and the full screen version on the other--no trailers, nothing. Perhaps at some point there might be a special edition or director's cut which will restore the missing footage. I can't recommend this title in its current DVD incarnation."
3,An average release that could have been so much better...,"An okay transfer of the movie on a bare-bones DVD.Unfortunately, the makers of this disc decided NOT to include the 53 minutes of additional footage that was shown on the NBC broadcast of this film. This additional 53 minutes shows the sinking of the U-Boat during a storm, along with some additional fighting scenes.Hoperfully a Special Edition of this film will be released that will feature either an extended cut or offer the deleted scenes seperately."
3,Well Shot,"This movie is well shot its photography is outstanding. Bisset is gorgeous, in this movie watch it even for her. Quint from JAWS shows up but his performance not as good as in JAWS. Nick Nolte is real 70's. The plot though is O.K. Its not the greatest movie I think youll ever see but enough to keep you awake. Even a guy from JAWS 3 shows up in this flick I think his name is Louis Gosset Junior I dont know this guys name but he is in it. Alot of stars in it but an O.K movie about some treasure underwater."
3,"Beautiful photography, and that's about it","The Deep grabs your attention in the first ten minutes, which shows Jacqueline Bisset and Nick Nolte scuba diving, and Bisset's wearing a.....well, you probably already know. The underwater photography throughout this movie is gorgeous, but the action that happens on land, I felt, was kind of fake and somewhat improbable. The story is interesting, though, but it could've been told in the film better. The book by Peter Benchley is good, though. The film's worth watching for the underwater photography.....and the first 10 minutes."
2,wrong cover image...not widescreen,"I ordered 'The Deep' DVD from Amazon , and based on the cover image shown and thedescription I thought it was the wide screen version of the film. The DVD Iordered was from an Amazon seller, but showed as being 'fulfilled by Amazon'. Afterreceiving the DVD I realized it was the full screen version of the film.I called customer service ,received a refund and a return label for the incorrectDVD, and was told to order again because the first order had come from an Amazon seller(but fulfilled by Amazon).I ordered a second time directly from Amazon and again received the incorrect fullscreen version of the film. The full screen version of the DVD has a totallydifferent cover showing the pictures of all the actors in the film. I alsoreceived a refund for the second DVD."
3,A Little Harsh,"This toner is a little harsher than I'd like it to be, and I can't really tell if it's doing anything for my pores. I have been using a pore minimizing cleanser, and that's definitley been having an impact, so maybe this product is working well in conjunction with the other, but I really don't know. There's nothing particularly wrong with this toner, it works at least as well as any other toner, but it definitely didn't knock my socks off."
4,Nice stuff,"Smells good, tingles my skin, very low price compared to other name brand drugstore favorites. Def. recommended."
1,Egad. How dreary.,"Don't believe the synposis that speaks of the transformative power of love. I purchased this book because it was said to deal with androgyny, bisexuality, and the adventures of a young explorer of music and psychedelia.What this is is one of those terribly depressing books in which an antiheroine's life is utterly destroyed by her transgressive lifestyle. Orleigh, our protagonist, winds up basically raped, betrayed, imprisoned, her baby taken away and her lover dead. If you'd like to read a tale where bisexuality and a taste for adventure and kink lead to desolation, buy the book. Otherwise, I'd suggest you pass."
4,Very nostalgic,"These tracks bring me back to high school. I remember when Prodigy, the Orb, and Underworld were all over the TV - now I don't even have cable. I saw Keoki on Broadway once and nearly wet my pants. Of course, I was 18. I love this album, but I'm completely irrational about it. Is it truly good? I dunno, but it was formative for me."
1,False advertizing: watch out!,"The product discription says it includes the head device, springs, and ratchets. The picture shows the whole device. But they are only selling the mount that goes above the door. They are deliborately false advertizing it so people buy it, but have a few places that say ""door mount only"" just to cover themselves. They should show a second picture of just the door mount, and delete the description and replace it with just ""door mount only for the traction device"".I hope they will give me a refund. I'll let you guys know if they refund the shipping, though I doubt it. I'm probably out at least $11 in shipping."
1,Another crappy Wilton product!,"I bought the marking mat and garland marker, and the mat is flimsy and rolled up in such a way that it has creases and won't lay flat. This means it curls up into your cake frosting or fondant when you're working on it. This is the fourth lousy Wilton product I've purchased and lost cash on. If anything, I'll probably transfer the markings onto a hard board so at least the information won't be lost.Before you buy ANY Wilton product, do an amazon search and check out the reviews. It seems Wilton's more interested in raking in cash than having satisfied customers."
1,"""Marilyn Manson""","Tim Wilson is a pathetic excuse for a comedian. If he thinks that disrespecting Brian Warner (Marilyn Manson) is a good idea, then he is sadly mistaken. Frankly, I am surprised that an angry mob of Manson fans haven't yet lit this man's house on fire. But of course, Mr. Wilson isn't anywhere near popular enough to be known amongst Manson fans. I am certain that his existance is only acknowledged by those who accidently stumble upon his name as a friend of mine did. He informed me of Mr. Wilsons extremely stupid, pointless, and disrespectful 'bit' and I was quite unpleased. Personally, I think that we should blow off Mr. Wilsons head and see if it grows back, thank you Mr. Omega Muerte for that wonderful idea. Marilyn Manson is by far a more talented artist than Tim Wilson will ever be, and if he produces any more recordings that are that disrespectful to Mr. Manson, then he will be hearing from me. And I warn you, it will not be pretty. -Courtney M Rivera, 14.-"
5,Great for rosacea!,"My husband's dermatologist recommended this soap for his rosaca, other methods of treatment had been less than successful. I also have a mild case, so we both use it. It has worked wonders in keeping the rosacea completely under control. It is very mild and gentle and does not dry out the skin. It is a wonderful product!"
5,Masterful exposition on employment issues,"This excellent book examines the phenomenon of job insecurity in America. Author and newspaper reporter Louis Uchitelle traces the development and decline of the American expectation of stable, remunerative, virtually lifetime employment. Republicans may have taken the boldest steps in rolling back the expectation of job security (Ronald Reagan's firing of the air traffic controllers spoke eloquently for the new order), but they did not do so alone or unopposed. Democratic presidents and politicians did not make preventing layoffs a major campaign issue or administrative priority. Uchitelle writes smoothly and evocatively, particularly about the individual experiences of laid-off workers for whom the surviving avenues of American opportunity were dead ends. We recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what killed the historic American trust between workers and employers, and how to staunch the bleeding caused by layoffs."
3,Good item,Love it!It is working really well.My students love it as well.It is just a little pricy.Thanks.
2,Very Small,This clock shown to be must larger. I am teching children to identify the times. I could have used the class clock if I had know how small this clock was. I better look closer to numbers instead of pictures. I feel this was not good advertising.
5,Just what we needed..,My girls were having a hard time learning time at school so we bought this to help out.. its simple and nice to have at home.. the only problem is the leg comes off very easy but other than that works great..
4,If it's light entertainment you're looking for....,"Being an die-hard exploitation movie fan, I have to admit there are very few jd movies I've seen. Although, it is easy to become familiar with the sub-genre after watching just one (take a look at the excellent Brit-flick, BEAT GIRL). I reccomend this film to anyone who wants to enjoy some light, trashy, late-night viewing involving a bunch of teeny-boppers. Tony, a juvinile delinquent and his pals rob a milk-bar. Later on, Tony is discovered by a TV producer and gets a big-time job singing on a popular TV show. His friends get jealous as you'd expect. One of them, Moody (Peter Breck, who later starred in Sam Fuller's SHOCK CORRIDOOR), in the meantime kills the owner of a bar later and gives Tony the blame. Breck, by the way, gives one of the best performances I've ever seen in an exploitation movie; he even provides a lot of intentional humour which keeps this potboiler moving."
3,HOODS!!!!!,"Another film about a gang of punk hoods. The Alpha print is the usual with splices and frames missing. Overall, the picture quality is just fine. The dollar store Digiview release is the same print and you get a double feature. Full screen."
1,Bad Support,"I bought one of these units almost two years ago. It prints good looking pictures. It is very convenient to replace only one emply color. etc.I would strongly suggest not buying this unit. Because it is not one of Canon's most popular availabilty of software drivers for future operating systems might not be developed.According to Devin the Canon Technical Support Representative ""There are no known plans to devise a driver for x64 with this unit. I am sorry for any trouble caused by this.""What trouble not being able to use it with my computer any more, that's not ""trouble"" that is an utter lack of Canon's comitment to thier customers. Beware of Canon, once they sell you a product they don't care anymore."
2,Wonderful printer for about 3 weeks,I only had this printer for 3 weeks before the printhead went out. Plus the cost of ink and special Canon paper and I had [price] in the printer just for supplies. It uses up ink at a very fast rate. It will only print on Canon paper or a very few other expensive photo papers. My old HP 895 is still chugging away afer several years and I have never had trouble with it and it prints on anything.
1,READ Before you get a Canon S9000!,"That Canon would make a printer requiring the user to return the entire machine to be taken into an authorized service shop is astonishing.Eventually EVERY owner will see their S9000 warn them about the ink overflow pad at the bottom of the printer, and soon the printer will stop functioning. You will have no choice but to spend about half the cost of the printer to have the printer torn down, the pad replaced and the printer reset, unless you can do it yourself and void the warranty.Other problems with the S9000 include a tempermental print head, which requires regular cleaning (and ink waste).On our S9000 the paper alignment bar is extremely sticky, worse than any bottom-of-the-line printer we've operated.The paper handling is pretty bad, and the S9000 will occasionally pull in paper at an angle even though it has fed straight.After a year-and-a-half, our S9000 is about dead except for B&W; printing."
3,Problems with colour,"I have found the 9100 to be a fine printer for the digital photographer enthusiast and especially useful for turning our posters for a local theatre group.However, I tried to economise by buying cheaper inks and now find that my prints are never of the correct hue. They are all tending towards the blue end of the spectrum.I am wondering if returning to Canon inks will solve this problem or if my printer is past its sell by date. I've had it for two years and fancy a 6600d but I wonder if I should consider looking at Epson???"
1,Wish I hadn't bought it!,"Unfortunately, this printer has not performed for me as it has for other reviewers. The prints from a digital camera are not colored matched. The blues have a red-overtone. Tech support answers my e-mails with unhelpful suggestions like ""How to do the basic printer maintenance and cleaning"". They do not know how to address the problem, or undertand it. The printer has become worthless to me, because the colors in the photos are not accurate. The same photos print perfectly on an HP 1220. The Canon is also VERY NOISY and is CONSTANTLY cleaning itself, and I mean CONSTANTLY. It is very slow to start, because it has to clean every time I start it up and it will even interrupt a print job to clean. I wish I hadn't bought it."
2,Paper will not feed,"I have always purchased high end Epson printers whenever a new printer came out. I was in a photo shop and saw a demo on the S9000 and bought one. It worked fine(with Canon Paper Pro only)until out of warranty. The paper feed now is is poor, destroying more paper than it prints, printing half photos when it does feed. Can't get any help from customer service. Ink is expensive and not easy to find. Have to stock up when it is available, or order over the Internet. Satisfied with print quality, but going back to Epson. All my camera gear is pro Canon and is superior, but high end Epson printers I think are a cut above in the printing arena."
1,Ink is NOT good enough,Yeh its fast and if you buy the photo pro paper the prints are very nice but watch out on the BCI-6 ink! Its not a pigmented ink and is prone to fading! I found this time consuming and a costly waste. Some more work needed here Canon!I did not keep my printer for this reason and sold it.You too now have been warned.
5,A Scientific Analysis of Important Data Related to Evolution,"This book offers an excellent scientific analysis of important data related to the theory of evolution. I have a degree in Applied Physics from Georgia Tech but portions of this book were over my head. Having said that, a vast majority of the book was intellectually stimulating and raised some very real questions about evolution theory that are often ignored and left unanswered. College professors need to read this book in order to have a balanced view of the different theories regarding the origin of life. This book is NOT a theological book and does not promote religion. It is scientific to the core and extremely compelling. I highly recommend it to the scientific community and other interested persons."
3,response to the review By Tom Sullivan,"This is a response to the review By Tom Sullivan (York, PA):Using terminology like the following does not encourage open and honest debate. You are using emotion to defend your position. Try arguments that don't contain judgement. Use persuasion, not ridicule...bafflegabbaloneyID-iotGet over itpoorly educated ID-iots, who generally are clueless about real scienceOnly ignorant suckers are taken in by them"
1,window regulator,"After i waited 3 weeks for the item and kept on calling they finally tell me they don't have one and wasted three weeks of my time,Thanks sal"
2,Window regulator Dodgle Gr Caravan '97,"Regulator new in box, install was straight forward, and quality appears fine.I had hoped to install the new regulator before a family vacation two weeks away, and saw that Fedex had the shipment info the next day. We didn't get the regulator until 4 weeks later, A week after our vacation with the window wired close, but squealing at highway speed because it wasn't closed tight.I guess I expected much quicker delivery."
3,Entertaining,"This book is entertaining for sure, but it features strictly high school level descriptive writing. I just wish that someone with better writing talent had told the story."
2,"If you loved the TV show, that does NOT mean you will like the book...",I loved the TV show. I was expecting the book to be something like it. It isn'tanything like it. You can see that some of the TV characters are based in small part on the people in the book...but that's about it. But it is a fine book about HS football.
3,Decent Book.,"I found all they hype about this book slightly misplaced. It was a good book and worth the read, but I found that it jumped all over the place and could be hard to follow at times. The content is interesting I just did not like the form the author used to convey it."
1,Not sure what was worse,"Not sure what was worse, reading this 'item' or pounding my head against a concrete wall. It has received much fan-fare, and I don't know why, it's best described as...trite."
1,Football or a Town?,"I did not like this book at all. I was expecting that this book would be more about the life of the people who played football, but not the town. the whole book was mianly about Odessa and its ""imprtant history"" I do not recommend this book to people who think they are going to read about football."
3,My old ground!,I know about the high school football craziness of the South region. Insane! This book brings me memories of my old grounds in Alabama. Strange for a Spaniard to be there but people were nice and cheery.Bissinger brings that attitude into my life through hsi writing. Better of course than the movies but Billy Bob is cute :)I think you could read this in three days.
4,As good as the hype around it,"It does go on a bit too long, but as a former (bad) football player I really liked this book. The players are all brought to life and the town and all it's inhabitants are well described."
4,A great book!,"Friday Night Lights, is well written and give an in-depth look on the hardships family, peers, and even ones own town can put on a person. I recommend for anyone who likes an interesting read or anything about sports."
4,Very good!,"I am late in reading this book, but I thought it was very good. Since everything has already been said, I'll only add a brief comment. If you have children who have played youth and high school sports, including Pop Warner football, you will understand the frenzy and the pressure to win. There's a lot of good that comes from the competition, but this book shows how quickly a career can end before it is even realized."
3,Mindless sheep....,"Odessa Texas is a town whos inerts consist mainly of football and trivial and frivolous things of the like, the people here in odessa could'nt tell what time it was if it was'nt for football.The pathtetic citizens of this dimunitively minded town are bred and led like the mindless sheep they are.Quite oftenly I take great amusment in watching these people, theyre pathetic and meaningless lives, and the ""religion"" that they so cherish and would willingly give up theyre own lives for."
1,Friday Night Light,I hated this book from the first page. There was to much about the history of Odessa Texas and not enough about the football team. It felt like I was reading a history book. I did not care when the first kid played for the Permain Panthers football team and how the town uses to be segregated. I think that H.G.Bissindiger didn't talked enough about the football team. Even when he tryed to tell you about the game he did not give you the overal play; he give you how each team scord. what did mojo have to do with this
2,Not For Football Fans,"Having first seen the movie, I was prepared that this was not a starry-eyed wholesale endorsement of high school football, but I was still thrilled when my wife surprised me with a copy to read.I have never been so dissapointed with a book on football, or all of sports for that matter. I enjoyed Next Man Up and A Civil War, due to Feinstein's balance between negative and positive lights on the game. Bissinger, in Friday Night Lights, shows no such balance.He does not ""follow the season"" in any logical fashion, sometimes skipping entire games, and spends a chapter instead focusing on national politics. Honestly, you'll see the name of Michael Dukakis more than you will the name of Permian's starting quarterback.I love football, I love high school athletics, and found this book to be very annoying. Check it out in a library before you spend your dollars on it."
4,Time Marches On,"I am a 2001 grad of Permian High School and I can say that I remember the East Side of town getting carried away with Permian football when I was younger. However, I do not remember any significant racism at all and didn't know what the ""N"" word meant until junior high. Odessa has changed dramatically since 1988 - the economy is much better, has more diversity, and has more stability than it used to; more businesses and corporations are coming to Odessa; our schools are much better academically; and our medical facilities are now some of the best in the state. Football also has a different place now. The Panthers have not been to the state playoffs since 1998 and have not had a winning season since then - in '99 they went 4-6 and in '00, '01, and '02 they went 5-5. This has been a mixed blessing because it has allowed other sports and also the fine arts to receive proper recognition. Friday Night Lights is a book about what Odessa used to be, not what it is now."
2,A terrific book - but a bad read on Kindle!,"In terms of content, please reference other reviews. I am writing to talk about the way this book reads on the Kindle. I have a feeling that the original pages were scanned and converted to be read as an e-book, instead of typed as its own digital file.The font is unusual for the Kindle, and is sometimes mis-formatted. The pages take especially long to turn, which goes against Amazon's attempts to ""make the Kindle disappear"" - it is a constant reminder that you are reading an e-book, as opposed to other books where you forget that you're reading from a screen."
4,A true portrayal of West Texas life.,"I could not put the book down. It brilliantly wove together football, politics, history, and economics. I think Bissinger got an accurate feel for the culture of Odessa. Having been born in Crane and raised in Odessa, I felt that he had discovered and portrayed the people of West Texas, although he overemphasized some topics with a liberal Yankee slant. I graduated from Permian, didn't play football, but was caught up in that culture, and after having moved away, began to see it as a kind of madness or silliness. The book brought back many emotions. It was very well written."
2,long read,"Since I am not into football, this book was a long read for me. It could have been halved and the story complete."
4,"God, this is good!","I just finished reading this for Sociology class at college, and was very impressed. It goes beyond the usual recounting of a football team into the team's town's search for something to hang their hats on, to claim as their own.Bissinger's style is almost excruciating to read, as he cuts away from the action just when the reader's interest is most peaked, to discuss different people's reactions to side issues involving the team, the town, race relations, and the cult of masculinity and sports built up around the Permian High team. However, this style is exactly what makes the book impossible to put down.In the end, the 1988 team that Bissinger covers does not win the state championship, but it is revealed in the epilogue that the following year's team did. However, instead of this being joyous, it simply emphasizes the point of exactly how expendable the players that Bissinger covered were to the town and the team.From beginning to end, this book hits its targets hard."
5,One of the finest sports books written...,"For anyone interested in high school football, whether it's a player, parent, friend, or supporter, this book is must read. Even if you're none of the above you will come away with something from this book. One my personal favorites, it is gripping story about a small Texas town and the impact of high school football at all levels. Never a dull moment from start to finish, a book you will recommend to others without hesitation."
4,Awsome,"I thought this was a gr8 book. It really hooks you. I would n't suggest this book for kids any lower than 6th grade. It took me a while but it's good. It would be a great goft for a young sports freak like me.Sincerely,ESPNFREAK"
3,Doesn't Match the Series,"My mistake was in reading this book and watching the movie after thoroughly enjoying the series and the morals promoted by the series. Having grown up in TX and involved with the football program there, I found the book & movie to be an extreme over reaction to the love of football enjoyed in the state of TX."
4,Not just about football,"This book has a very similar feel to the classic football book ""The Blindside"", as it goes much deeper than what happens between the hash marks. I especially enjoyed the sections dedicated to the economic rise and fall of Midland Texas, and the way the savings and loan crisis was interwoven into the framework of this book.Excellent read!"
5,Well worth it,"I loved reading this book-once I got started, I could not put it down and I don't consider myself a fan of football at all. This book is an intimate look at one town's personality- but this situation occurs in towns across the country, the only thing that may change is the sport. The author does a good job at pulling the reader in and making them care about the players, coaches and the game...by the end I was in the stands too, hoping for the win. I was amazed at the townspeople's actions after a loss, the support that they show for a game, the callous treatment of players who are ""finished"". I'm from a small Texas town myself and it was an eye-opening experience for me. I think that anyone interested in society would want to read this book."
4,Lights out,"What a book, better than the movie. Football is religion in Texas. It's more of a religion now. READ this book!"
4,interviewed the author and documented this subject,I used this as a reference and interviewed the author several years ago for a short documentary on the subject of Texas and football; found the book to be entertaining in its delivery as well as accurate; obviously it does not cover all sides of the issue but does an admirable job of conveying the emotion behind the zealous committment to football in Texas
3,Another great sport story,"the city i play high school football in has a great football team, it also has money, shopping, and entertainment. but for the small town of odessa in west texas they only have two things, oil and that thing called football. with all of the oil running out i guess that leaves one thing left fooball!!! any highschool football player in the world would kill to have a fan base like the panthers do. this story tells about the panthers 1988 championship run. the football team overcomes a strict coaching staff, cocky teammates, and injuries to make it as far as possible against the toughest football teams in the nation. this story makes you want to go suit up and hit somebody."
3,Hold on till the end,"Not being a football fan, it took me awhile to get into this book. But I grew to care about the characters, and the last chapter and epilogue were excellent. Too bad it took so long to get there."
4,good book,i had to read this for a core class at my university and im am glad i bought the kindle version! the search feature was wonderful for finding answers and quotes for during the exam!
5,Brilliant book which weel deserved the TV series,A brillintly honest book which captures the spirit and essence of American High School football and how this sport can absorb whole towns. Bissinger does not pull his punches and his book richly deserved the TV series which went beyond the book.
3,Good Story... Little Repetitive!,"I must admit... I probably live in a cave since I had not seen the movie or the TV show. In fact I read this book figuring I was reading something uplifting like Remember the Titans. I didn't realize how much more than football this story really was. With that being said I found this story facinating. Buzz certainly paints a ""colorful"" picture of West Texas.I enjoyed this book but agree with others that the author gets rather repetitive when he is talking about the society and ""climate"" of the area. I would have prefered a little more about the football... of course that is coming form somebody who was expecting a football book!"
2,pretty good,The parrot: The volume control doesn't work and it doesn'tunderstand who to contact so good?? It's not great. I won'tsay to buy it.
2,Hard to figure out,"I have owned several of these types of product from Motorola and Jabra. This model from Parrot is really hard to figure out without studying the manual. Two examples -- the huge knob on the front of the unit does not adjust the volume during a call, and there is no obvious way to kick off the iPhone/Siri recognition engine. It seems like this thing is just grossly over-engineered, to the detriment of the normal or casual user."
2,Difficult to set up even for this Tekkie,"No, no, no - do not buy.If you want simple, get the Blue Ant Supertooth hands free.The round dial on this unit will drive you nuts.It is finiky and did not pass the 'easy to use test'.Sound quality is awful.Very distracting.It did pair eaily, but it kept changing lauguage each time I turned it on!I returned it and got the Blue Ant."
5,works well,"The Parrot MINIKIT is a good solution to handsfree cell phone use. It goes for a very long time on a charge, communication is clear and understandable. A good alternative to the headset."
4,Great Hands-Free Unit,"I've had this minikit for about a month now. I was initially concerned about its ability to pair with the iPhone, but did it almost too easily! It was very quick to locate and lock onto the iPhone. I share this unit with others, so you do have to ""unpair"" the phone from the minikit before switching to another phone. (Don't just turn off the minikit and turn it back on again. Go into the phone's bluetooth pairing menus.)Otherwise, build is good, volume is very good, even when driving down the road in a noisy car. The only thing that is lacking is probably a screen to see who is calling so that I don't have to pick up the phone and see myself. I heard you can use this to voice activate who you would like to call, but the iPhone does not offer this. (Not a beef with Parrot, but with Apple.) I would recommend this to anyone needing a hands-free device and not wanting to look like a geek with a bluetooth thing sitting in their ear all the time."
5,Parrot Bluetooth Handsfree,Product worked as advertised. Connects flawlessly and very easy to use. Provides excellent handsfree communications.
5,Parrot Minikit,I purchased one for my husband in June. It works great. Easy to activate and voices are clear. We plan to get one for my car too.
4,Best blue tooth device I have ever used.,Pros: Sound quality is loud and clear. Voice activated dialing works well. The device is very easy to answer and hang up. It goes where you go without installation. People you are speaking to can actually hear and understand what you are saying. Easy to pair.Cons: Actual talk time is closer to five hours. Device does not always stay paired with my smart phone. Takes some trial and error to figure this thing out but is well worth it.
1,Terrible,"I give the Parrot ZERO stars. When linked to my Blackberry, I can hear just fine, but anyone that I speak with says that my voice ""comes and goes"". It is not cell phone signal strentgh, because as soon as I break the bluetooth connection, everyone says that I sound fine. I wish it worked better, the size is perfect, easy to place anywhere on the dashboard or visor, simple to operate and adjust volume, but its main purpose is its flaw.Lee"
3,Great when it pairs correctly,"I purchased this portable Bluetooth speaker kit after reading many positive reviews online. For the most part, this is a high quality product that works very well when it decides to pair fully with my Verizon LG VX8700.Occasionally though, the voice commands don't function through the Parrot's call buttons, which you're supposed to press once then speak. Most of the time I have to activate the voice commands through the phone, which effectively negates the benefits of leaving the phone in my pocket while driving. Also, when dialing a number or during a conversation, the signal cuts in and out, resulting in a choppy sound. I often find myself asking the person on the other line to repeat themselves.But don't be discouraged, as I still think my issues are related to my phone, and not the kit itself. Nevertheless, I'm strongly thinking about returning it to Amazon if I can't get it to work closer to 100% of the time."
5,Best Handsfree Ever Made,"I purchased 2 of these, one for myself and one for my dad. We both drive manuals and don't like having things in our ears when we drive, and this is the solution. My dad drives 2 different cars on a regular basis, so unlike the built-in car kits he can move this between vehicles easily. The audio quality is excellent, it never seems to run out of battery juice, and overall it's been a fantastic purchase. Did I mention there is a $20 rebate on parrot's website right now too?Pros:* Easy to use* Bluetooth syncs quickly* Plenty loud when driving* It's like talking to someone in the car* No fumbling for an earpiece when you get a call* Awesome Battery Life* Doesn't slide off sun visor, strong clipCons:* Could be smaller on sun visor* No Caller DisplayIf you're in the market, it's a great buy."
3,Works well for some phones.,"Parrot Bluetooth Portable Speaker MinkitThe product works well when it works. It was supposed to support the Apple iPhone (other Parrot products do), but it doesn't. Does link nicely with my wife's Razr, and she is happy with it. The lights to indicate power are difficult to see. The power charger uses the miniUSB port, so is compatible with about every other charger I have. Size is good - and I personally like the black color. Supports handsfree voice dialing."
1,bluetooth car kit,"I would not recommend this. I bought it a few months back and did not have time to use it until recently. Something went wrong with the unit and the volume knob came off. Anyone know how I can get it repair or get a replacement, since my husband throw the box and everything out."
2,not as advertised; not compatible with all Bluetooth phones.,"I sent an email to Amazon because I was told by a Verizon servic rep that the Minikit was not compatible with my Bluetooth phone. I have returned it, as per Amazon's instruction and I am awaiting a refund."
1,don`t buy it,"It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320. Costumer service told me I need a software abdate, but can not use any Mac Computer. Paid somebody to do the update,and it was worth then before. Very bad experiance with Parot Costumer Service."
4,Great Price for the Quality,"I have tried several different bluetooth devices over the years from ones attaching to the ear to GPS devices with bluetooth technology. The ear piece devices were uncomfortable and picked up outside noise when talking. The GPS device had great reception, but the device was on the dash and unless I was sitting idle, others had trouble hearing me.The Minikit has great reception and since it mounts to the visor, I can speak clearly into it. I bought my wife the Minikit Slim which has some extra features that are nice but comes at a higher price. If you are looking for a basic bluetooth device with good communication at a great price, I would recommend the Minikit. Parrot seems to have placed themselves at the top of bluetooth technology."
4,Very good sound quality,"I'm very pleased with this unit. The sound quality reported by people I've talked to via the Parrot is excellent (much better than the built-in Bluetooth in my previous car, a BMW). It was also very easy to pair with my phone (T-Mobile Shadow).The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because I'd like the built-in speaker to sound a little better, but that's just nit-picking. This was definitely a good purchase."
3,"good, but has flaws","I use this every day and am mostly happy with it. My chief complaint has to do with the language settings. By touching the knob, it gives you the option to change languages, then it's easy to hit the wrong button and get the thing stuck in French or some other language. Getting it back to English while driving and mashing buttons on the thing is pretty unsafe and defeats its purpose. Luckily, I usually avoid this by trying not to touch buttons on it."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this Parrot speaker four months ago. It was very hard to tell when the speaker was on or off. The volume knob just spins in either direction, so you have to play with that until you get the volume where you need it to be. The speaker quality was ok, clear enough to hear what's being said, but very often, the person I called had to call me back because they were getting an echo when I called them using this speaker. Two days ago, I heard a loud crackle sound, and the speaker just stopped working. My cell phone still picks up the blue tooth unit, and switches over automatically to the Parrot speaker, but I cant hear or be heard over the unit at all. I would not recommend this unit to anyone. Don't waste your money on this one, its a clunker."
5,Works Great For Me!,"I've had this product for 2 days now and it works prefectly for me. Not sure what all the other gripes are about, when set up correctly and charged fully this item works flawlessly! And bonus, most people can't hear my kids in the back seat!"
2,Didn't work for me.,Paired well with my phone and sounded good to me. Others on the other end complained of excessive static in most calls. Same luck with my wife's phone. I wrote to Parrot who told me only to soft reboot phone which proved of no benefit. Returned to Amazon as defective and got full refund--no problem. Bought a BlueAnt Supertooth 3 that is very good--no static!
4,Outstanding Bluetooth Speakerphone,"I recently purchased this item and I am truly pleased with it!Larry - Hamilton, ON., Canada"
4,Parrot Minikit remote speaker phone,This little speaker phone works well with my cell phone. It is relatively inexpensive and allows me to comply with California law while traveling through the state.
2,"works well, but","Works well, but is difficult to program for voice recognition. I still have not figured it out. I am just using it for incoming calls and calls I manually start with my phone. I also can not get it to answer, when ringing, without physically opening the phone, pushing the green button does not work for me. The instructions are very vague. It does have fabulous battery time and an acceptable speaker/microphone. It is a good value for the money and would be an even better one if I can ever get all the features working. I know it is operator error, but I don't ever have this kind of problems with my considerable amount of other ""tec"" stuff."
5,Works Great,"Product works great. I can hear everyone just fine and everyone can hear me just fine as well. The battery does last forever even in the harsh winter we have had lately. Its probably been about 2 months since the last recharge. Once its set up, very simple to use. Just turn it on and it links to my phone automatically."
1,Unreliable minikit,"I bought this minikit because it got good reviews and it would be perfect for my purposes. However it switches on and off whenever it wants, it looses contact with the phone. Very often the on/off button works only in a horizontal position (?) I use a Treo 650, which is on the compatible phone list. When I contacted Parrot, they said it wasn't (?) At last I opened the unit, but there are no moving parts inside except the micro switches. It is giving me a headache, so I will go searching for an alternative."
5,A great tool!!!!!!!,It's great for my fly fishing trips. Excellent quality and performance. I hope that well be my company for many years.
5,Victorinox Fisherman Pocket Knife,"I bought this thing and put it in my tackle box, the scissors are good for cutting the excess line off of the hook. I haven't used much anything else on it yet, due to the fact that I haven't had time to go fishing as much as I'd want to. I still like this knife alot thought, and I'd recommend it for anyone's tackle box."
1,Not the right author...,"This should have been an immensly interesting chapter in inorganic chemistry. But the author doesn't manage to deliver any overview, insight or 'mental discoveries' of new or old concepts. It becomes too much like listening to someone reading from a catalogue.I appologice, this could have been written in a better way."
2,great for dental floss,"Oh well, not what was advertised. No lid, and all dimensions were off by inches. To avoid the return hassle, I will install in my bathroom for tissue, floss etc. But I really needed the one in the photo for my kitchen!"
3,No Trash Door,"This item looks like the picture but the item description is misleading - there is no ""Trash Door"". I was expecting a garbage can with a lid but got a garbage can without a lid."
1,Not exactly ...,"The screws were to long and went through the cabinet door. Not only that, the screws work loose and fell out. Now my wife has the basket sitting on the floor of the cabinet. Would not recommend."
2,Not what I expected,"Hoping to replace my ancient door-mounted kitchen trash container, 18""x12""x8"", I bought this new one. There was no info on measurements and I guessed from the photo and ""trash door"" description, that it had a lid. Unfortunately, it was much smaller at 13""h x 10""w x 7"" deep, and had no lid, so I just repaired my old one, and used this one in the bathroom."
3,garbage can lack of,"The thing I regret about this item is that it doesn't have a trash door, which makes it unhygienic in the kitchen."
2,I concur with the previous negative reviews,"This item is entirely too small to be considered a ""kitchen garbage can"". Additionally, don't be misled by the phrase ""Trash Door"", it does not come with any sort of lid. Probably better served as a bathroom garbage can."
3,Didn't buy it,"Didn't buy based on reviews noting false advertising re lid (door). Also looked up exact item on organize.com; that site very specifically in multiple places states no lid. Amazon always claims their descriptive info is direct from manufacturer or ""marketplace"" company so doesn't accept liability for that. Totally understand, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out many of the discrepancies appearing on their site. Someone either doesn't pay attention or doesn't care. No matter. Whenever I have a suspicion about descriptive info, I always try to find the item elsewhere to compare & also check reviews. Better safe than sorry since, if the problem isn't an Amazon error, you are stuck with the freight you saved buying the item in the first place! Have not bought many items after checking out other sources of info. Buyer beware!"
1,Wrong item,"I ordered this with a lid. It came without one, but I am unable to return the item. I don't think I'll get anything else from you. Eileen Peregoff. PS you can't even get my name right. It's PEREGOFF"
4,Salt of the Earth,"I really like this CD because it contains a variety of Gospel sounds. From upbeat contemporary to soulful and worshipful. It took awhile to grow on me when I first purchased it several years ago. But once I got into it, and the CD accidentally cracked, I promptly replaced it by making a purchase through Amazon."
5,spectaculer,"Very well written and acted campy take on the early salem Mass. witch trials. Using the as of yet untested talents of some promising unknowns including""police acadamy's ""tackleberry"" and also the mayor a star on ""saving grace"" . Bawdy raunchy comedy at it's naughty best."
3,More truth then they knew,"If you like silly, zany, 2nd city type laughs, then this movie is for you. The comedy was relentless. Everywhere you looked, there was a subplot that was almost as engaging as the main plot. The part that got to me the most was when Ann Ramsey did her brief cameo at the end. She appears as the real witch and tells the Salemites that they are idiots. Her point was that a real witch would never have allowed the type of treatment that the town became famous for. The irony was rich."
1,?,I have not purchased this product. Don't know why Amazon says I recommend it. I can't recommend something I haven't seen.
4,AWESOME GAME,"First of all, this game is bassically a good game for gamers that like action. Just to let you know this game requires some skill so be prepared. This game only has a few stages, but a lot of gotcha borgs(the little robot things). I recomend this game for those who play action games such as supersmashbros.melee."
5,I've gotcha with some force!!!,"This game is just great! I mean, there are many units to collect, trade and train. As battles progress, your ""Borgs"" or battling robots gain valuable HP, defense, attack, and beam attack. The only way to get borgs are to get ""Battle Points"" which are also used as EXP. If you have at least 10,000 BP (Battle Points) then you MAY get a gotcha borg or a ""Data Crystal"" which is a building block for a powerful Gotcha Borg, however, these are even MORE RARE then a gotcha borg. But, if your persistant, then you'll get a DC (Data Crystal), however, you need 2-4 different DC's, for example, a blue ""Flame Dragon"" (there are 2 Flame Dragons, one blue and one green) would need Data Crystals 164A & 164B, after you collect them, you see the data crystals merge into one Gotcha Borg. However, some GB's need 4, like Sasuke need DC's 004A, 004B, 004C, 004D! But in the end this game is worth it."
3,Their best predates this album,"As much as I dig these guys, I would suggest that money spent on this album would be better spent purchasing their earlier collections, either Collector's Item or their earlier Greatest Hits package.These songs are for the most part fine, but make clear that their best work came in the previous years, from Back Stabbers through Livin' for the Weekend and Ship Ahoy."
4,Not exactly what its title implies.,"Unfortunately, this compilation's producdrs failed to include such beauties as ""I Can't Stand The Pain"", ""Put Our Heads Together"" and the majestic ""Extraordinary Girl"" on this budget-priced CD. Not one of the O'Jays 1983-86 hits was included here...as a result you can't consider it truly definitive. Most of the songs here, however, are great--it would have been nice,though, to have more of their mid-to-late 1980s PIR hits here."
3,Kindle,"As much as I like my Kindle, it is difficult to use for cookbooks. I ended up downloading the kindle-app to my computer and print out the recipes I plan to use."
1,Cheap Plastic / Crappy Build Quality,"The quality of the materials and build for these products is very low, if you haven't handled them, you will be surprised by the cheap plastic. The idea is good, clearly there will be more such things in the future. But the two products from this company I have tried (OhMiBod and Ohmibod club vibe) are badly made and will fail. I had the club vibe controller burn out the egg in one 10 minute use and then burn out a couple more similarly sized eggs in a couple minutes of use each. Lame."
2,Didn't last but a few uses.,"I really liked the different pulses and worked well for me. It is more powerful than others I have used; by no means quiet. Unfortunately, I never got to use the ipod feature as it stopped working after just a few uses. I took the batteries out after every use like the directions said hoping to preserve batteries and make it last longer."
1,don't bother,"Bought thinking you could vibe to your favorite music, but the volume had to be up so high that it was unsettling. Then the vibes came on like gangbusters with the louder passages and virtually nothing with the softer. Retired to the circular file."
2,Not worth the cash.,"With how high the price is, there is no way it can be worth it. The rythmn feature is great (some hot dance tunes can get anyone off real fast), but really other than that, there is nothing that is that great about it. Rubber or something more fleshlike would have been more comfortable (and realistic ;)). It had to be made out of this cheapish plastic.Also, I have gotten better stimulation out of cheaper ones, so not even the vibrating is that great. The music feature is great, but I would only get this if you are really set on that one thing."
5,campground directory,this is a very helpful directory. we do a lot of camping and it will be very helpful as to choosing what camp site we want to go to.
5,Very essential.,"A must for anyone traveling in a RV. AAA does not have a book as comprehensive as Woodall's. Every campground in North America is in here. The only drawback is its size...large and heavy. Over a thousand pages can be unwielding, but great as a reference."
4,It's Just A Tool ...,"Highly informative but far from comprehensive. Does not include information on many National Forest and State Park campgrounds. Ratings do not necessarily correspond to ""desireability"" (which is in the eye of the beholder). Best advice -- use for general information, but check things out for yourself and don't be afraid to go on down the road to a park that may not even be listed."
4,Woodalls,"Excellent book, sometimes the woodalls ratings are quite my opinion but otherwise a great source."
1,Only Good for Truck Drivers,I bought this as a gift and it looks like the phone pages. Waste of money for us but would probably be great if I was a truck driver instead of a mom looking for fun places to go camping with the family!
1,Santa with popup bear and puppy,"Tried this out when it arrived to be sure it worked, and it was fine. A week later when the yard was being decorated the pop ups did not pop. Returned item to the company."
2,Disappointing,"Bought this on clearance last year, set it up this year and 3 days later we had to replace a bulb. No big deal until the main fan motor wouldn't power on. Checked fuses, power supply, etc. Nothing. Called Chrisha Creations and customer service wasn't available. Found out today they haven't made inflatables in a long time! They were very helpful and are going to try and find a spare fan motor, if there is one somewhere around the warehouse still.It's a shame because this was really cute and everyone loved watching it. I have a 2nd inflatable that has Santa going up and down a chimney. After one season the best he does is a little bob. I'll probably skip buying more of these and start looking at making wooden cut-outs of characters that I can light up myself."
1,Too Confusing,"This entire book was confusing, in it's ideas and the style of writing. It was very difficult to read. So much jumping between the 'present' time and the 1800's. I find it hard to even put together a summary.It roughly follows an invention that captures a person's soul. Then that soul can be transfered into another person, dead or alive. Interesting idea, however every part of this book misconnected with the rest of what ever story there was."
5,Donna Antonow is Delightful,"I first heard Donna Antonow in a live club performance, and was swept off my feet. Her piano skills are first-class, her singing is uniquely charming, and her musicianship is ""outta-sight"". Thank goodness for young musicians like Donna who are keeping REAL MUSIC alive. I love both her CD's, which are notable for the excellent choice of material, the fine sound quality, and the beautiful musical performances. Nothing can duplicate the magic of seeing/hearing Donna on stage, but her CD's come close! Highly recommended by me -- a jazz fan for over 50 years."
3,Domesticity with a tinge of excitement,"It isn't surprising that Louisa May Alcott is known for writing stories with domestic backgrounds. ""An Old Fashioned Girl"" is one such story. Polly is a country girl swept into the rich living of her relatives, and she is content with knowing she isn't rich. Years later, Polly finds that her family is in an economic decline. She tries her hardest to help them with the abilities of, what she calls herself, an old-fashioned girl. It is a good book, but it has some slow spots. If you enjoyed ""Little Women"", I highly recommend it."
5,Old Fashion Girl,"I love the story and think it would be wonderful forall young girls to read. The print is a little smallfor my eyes, but the story is very good.Billy Simons"
4,:),"For school I had to read this book, and ""yes"" I did enjoy it very much. Being fourteen, it was interesting to see how young people's lives were in this peaceful time period. Polly lives with the Shaws for a bit, but never really seems to fit in with her ""old-fashioned"" clothes and ways. In some ways I can relate to that. For instance, Polly dresses in modest clothes that are not all that fancy and eye catching. Most of the time, I where skirts, and when I do, they are not bright flashy colors, or short. I usually wear them below the knee. But, getting back to Louisa May Alcott's story, and away from mine, I found this a spectacular work of art. Beautifully written, sensible, and calm. Even though Polly does come across some small tragedies in her life. If only most books could be this ""old-fashioned"". Louisa May Alcott is a great writer of her time. (If you liked this you will also like ""The Inheritance""."
5,A book to treasure,"I'm 15 and you can call me a little bit old fashioned in my ways. I read an old fashioned girl for the first time when i was 11 and since then ive been reading the book at least 4 times a year.My copy of an old fashioned girl is sacred to me. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about a girl living in totally different times but who is really similar to us nowadays even is she is a little old fashioned! This book is good for any one of any age anywhere who wants to have someone to admire and someone to look up to. Polly is indeed, the perfect girl. As to Fanny and Tom they make the book livelier and funner to read, you'll never get bored with this book in your reach!"
5,My Favorite Louisa May Alcott book.,"This is my favorite Louisa May Alcott book. And that is really saying something considering how wonderful her books are and that I have read nearly all of them, including recently discovered manuscripts. Polly is a wonderful character and a good role model for young women. She teaches them to never forget who they are and that it is OK to follow their own dreams. She also teaches about loyalty (her reply to her first marriage proposal) and independence. I am so glad to see this book available for a new generation. I read it about 40 years ago for the first time and have re-read it regularly since."
5,What a book!,"I started reading it 2 days ago, and if you haven't guessed what I've been doing since then I'll tell you: Reading An Old-Fashioned Girl. Once I finally picked it up, I couldn't put it down! This book is definitely one of my favorites; the story of an `old-fashioned' teen girl, growing into a beautiful, honest, hard working, loving, kind and virtuous woman. LMA must be my favorite author, for I can't think of any other writer whose work I've read---and re-read. An Old-Fashioned Girl is one of her best books, though all of them are most wonderful and great reading for both children and adults alike."
3,Roofing in a nutshell,"This is a very brief, handy, six(6) unit fold-out, laminated pamphlet. It is a very concise guide to roofing repair. It including: A. Ladder Safety, B. Finding a Leak, C. Repairing Asphalt Shingles, D. Replacing Asphalt Shingles, E. Repairing Roof Flashing, F. Repairing Built-up and Roll Roofing, G. Replacing Wood Shakes and Shingles. There is also a concise guide to roof and tool nomenclature. This is a good starting point for first-time do-it-yourself roofing repair projects.Installation of new roofing is not discussed. The pamphlet is durable and fits right into your tool-box."
4,Pinball Crazy!!!,"This is pinball, gone crazy!!!A bunch of pinball games, in one package! It's great!!!!!!!!"
1,Irate fan of heroes,"I was hoping for something scholarly along the lines of Stephen Ambrose. Instead, the heroes' stories get short shrift for the political rants against those opposed to the war. What has that got to do with the heroes' fetes??? Instead of letting the heroes' voices tell the stories of their wartime experiences, the whole book is flawed with political hacking. I could care less about the politics of the war. I want to hear how well Americans have upheld our heritage as people who care for others as well as comrades, and will go to extraordinary lengths to achieve their goals. I didn't complete the book. I thought it was disgusting."
5,Wonderfully written and a superb tribute to the men and women of our armed forces.,Discover some of the inspiring stories of true American heroes.
3,Liked the book - glad I read it before I watched the movie,"I recently read ""The Fountainhead"" and was curious as to how it would be made into a movie. I am also a Gary Cooper fan and wondered how he would play the main character.The movie comes across as a series of monologues rather than good dialogue. The characters appear to be talking at each other rather than with each other. The actors do their best with the material, but unless you've read the book it would be difficult to follow what's happening on the film.Not recommended for anyone who has not read the book. I found the movie to be a nice diversion, but before you spend money on the movie spend money on the book.Ayn Rand's forte is philosophy, not screenwriting."
3,ayn rand philosophy,Very cheesey but also inspiring. The sex scenes are very strange and fantasy rape-like. The old view of 'no means yes' pervade. But the noble theme of 'don't sell out no matter what' shines thru. Wow!!!....How times have changed!!
5,A movie with a true message,"I found this to be an excellent presentation of the book Fountainhead. It is a great movie a movie that has meaning in the world of today, a message that has meaning for all people of all time. An individual that can remain true to his own creativity and stand against those who seek only to be part of the pack. Ayn Rnad's Howard Roark played by Gary Cooper is an inspiration to all - or should be."
5,A great movie,"Ayn Rand Clasic! It was really great to see this movie once more. I saw it years ago and never foregot one major scene, where Cooper breaks a piece of marble with a chisel, and says now its broken miss. Francone."
3,Good but frenzied,"You can definitely tell that the screenplay was done by Ayn Rand. She made sure the director followed her theme exactly which stifled the feel of the movie and the directors attempts of making the characters a little more human. Most if not all the characters dialogue felt like they were delivering a speech and in such a frenzied pace. It just didn't feel people would talk like that in real life. It's nice to see a film in black and white which has been shot so well. The lighting and shadows are used to good affect, but the acting is too stilted and often the dialogue is obviously one sided in trying to express the author's point to excessiveness. It's too bad since I admire Gary Cooper as an actor and felt that the movie might have been more effective in getting it's message out had it not been for the heavy hand of Miss Rand."
1,An Embarrassment,"I'm not overly fond of movies of most types, and that goes doubly forolder movies, but I'm going under the assumption here that the movieexpresses the views of the Ayn Rand, and it is those views that I findembarrassing.I'm picking out one or two lines which should give you an idea of whatI am talking about.""He served no one. He lived for himself.""These two sentences were spoken with a great deal of self-pride as if thiswere an admirable goal. I find it despicable.The other: ""The world is in an orgy of self-sacrifice."" First, of allthat sentence was never true at any time in the history of the world.And if it were, is this a bad thing?Just what is it that people find in Ayn Rand that is so appealing tothem. I find her appalling."
2,I am tired of terrible movies based on video games.,"I understand that Silent Hill, like Resident Evil, were really popular games with interesting characters, but that doesn't mean they all need movies made about them. And this movie does not seem to treat him as a product of James Sunderland's psyche at all! He is not supposed to speak at all, but instead keeps talking about ""rational actors"" and ""pulling oneself up by their bootstraps"". Also, it is supposed to be a pyramid on his head, not a fountain."
2,A movie with a BIG MESSAGE!,"And then some... There doesn't seem to be one line in this film (or in the book) that doesn't telegraph Rand's ""philosophy"" like a punch to the proboscis. The pompous & silly propagandizing is worse than Riefenstahl's films for Hitler. But it was prescient in one very key sense. It anticipated the strong need of today's viewing & reading public for easy-to-understand formulas that substitute for real thinking (& ""self"" understanding). Good cinematography though. Vidor always did have a great feel for the WPA look."
2,Highly overrated,"This is one of those unintentionally funny movies that gets funnier the more times you see it. We have a sneering villain who practically goes ""Muh ha ha!"" as he talks about the ""selfless man."" We have Gary Cooper and his monotone yep, nope acting style trying to convey a philosophy he reportedly did not understand in his courtroom speech. We have rape depicted as romantic foreplay and a final shot of Cooper atop a skyscraper that needed to be shown forward and reverse because there wasn't enough footage for the final scene, so we have that weird repeated back and forth movement of his hair in the wind. Over acted, over written, over blown. This movie has it all. If it were a comedy. Sadly, it is not. And no one seems to notice just how silly the whole affair is."
1,One word: Injustice!,"The Ayn Rand Institute should hunt down every copy of this video and destroy it. If you've read the book and haven't yet seen the movie... don't. The characters are shallow and the storyline is, well, to be desired. All I know is I loved the book and practically cried when I saw what a mess they made of the movie. But that's just my opinion. SEC"
3,The Fountainhead CD,"This is an important and very influential film based on the book with an excellent cast and acting with the exception of the female lead, Patricia Neal. Gary Cooper and Raymond Massey are perfect and since the screenwriter was also the author, Ayn Rand, it held very close to the book. As a CD from Amazon, it arrived quickly and was fine."
5,Good movie but the book was better,"I read the book and wanted to see what kind of movie one would make of it. If you like old movies you will like it, and even if you do not agree with the message of the movie it will challenge your mind and broaden your awareness."
3,Be less lazy and read the book.,"Don't get me wrong, the movie is enjoyable but one must keep it in its proper historical perspective. But the movie serves better as a supplement to the novel."
4,Movie was good had good background story and enjoyed watching it.,My husband was the one who wanted the movie and he really liked it. I would recommend it to other to watch.
5,The Fountainhead,"Great story line and super acting, enjoyed it very much. I would recommend it to anyone, especially Ayn Rand fans."
4,Too melodramatic for me,"I need to read the book. Since watching this film, I purchased a Kindle version of THE FOUNDTAINHEAD.I found the acting bad. This has to be Gary Cooper's worst performance. Most of the actors seemed to be reading their lines rather than acting. This has to be Raymond Massey worst performance also.I bought this film because I wanted to gain a more intimate understanding of Rand's perspective. For me, it was difficult to concentrate on the content, because the acting was too melodramatic. I suspect that the vision of being over dramatic has changed since 1948. However, I know other films of that era are better.I don't understand how Rand couldn't have seen this. The bad acting takes away from the content."
2,The Fountainhead,"The Fountainhead with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal is a great story. The black and white DVD that I received was poorly cropped (actually cutting off the top of the characters heads at some times), but it stuck to the story and was worth the price I paid for it."
5,Owen Coughlin hit it on the head!!,"i love his review on this movie and i too love this movie. everything he said, i agree with him. thanks for giving me the best laugh this morning. but as for this movie, it's one of my favorites because of the set design. i work for an architechual design firm and i kind of match the message of this film to the business here. very interesting concept. does architects design buildings for the interest of mankind or for self pleasure. something to think about when you visit the Guggenheim or the Sydney Opera house or the Eifel Tower. makes you wonder."
4,Rising above the subject,"This is a great movie. I am no fan of Ayn Rand's philosopy, but this is a passionate, melodramatic, stylish treatment of a rather banal allegory about the architecture of integrity. The acting is over the top as these characters make the most of the soapbox given them, but even more fascinating are the costumes and decor, which puts the Jetsons back in the '40s, for a glamorous mood framing this intense romance. In terms of the story's moral, however, I kept thinking that in real life, the people making the biggest fuss about ""individualism"" herein are the least likely to walk the walk. Liberals are parodied to the point of being ridiculous. Gary Cooper is truly heroic, meanwhile, and Patricia Neal is the ultimate Wonder Woman."
2,The Fountainhead,"The Fountainhead was an excellent book written by Ayn Rand many years ago. I bought the movie because I had enjoyed the book so much. Unfortunately, the dialog was very choppy & the acting was way over-the-top - like William Shatner on steroids. Gary Cooper was OK, though disappointing, but the rest of the cast was awful - especially the female lead, Patricia Neal. The one strong performance was the guy who played Elsworth Toohey (sorry - don't recall his name). Otherwise, I'd suggest skipping the movie & reading the book (even though it's very long)."
4,Ahead of her Time but Right on Obama's Scheduled Destruction,"This dvd celebrates what used to be right with America. The eventual fall of the U.S. will be from the demands of the un-vested, needy individuals set upon the dwindling number of available taxpayers. Independent citizens are outnumbered by minorities with an entitlement attitude, who demand their share, of unearned entitlements. Want to know what happened to Rome, look at the American fabric of victums today."
4,The book was better??,Kinda hard to say the book was better because Ayn Rand wrote the script for this movie version of her book. You'll definitely like the movie if you haven't read the book. I wonder why Ayn Rand left out so much good stuff especially during the era where a 2-3 hour movie experience was typical.
2,Read the book,"For the times this movie was made, the acting is good. I would love to see this same story done in more modern times where I believe the acting would be less in the dramatic style and seem more real to life. If you've read the book, this movie cuts out so much of what I loved in the book. I wish not only that it would be done in modern times but I can see it being done in a trilogy style to capture all the interaction of characters and the essence of the story would be more complete. If you have to choose between the book and the movie, choose the book!"
3,Time for a remake,Finally saw this amazing film..Don't know how I ever missed it..truly one of the oddest films to ever come out of Hollywood...the debt to Kane is not mentioned enough by reviewers here..campy and perfect time capsule of a certain completely lost American era. Time for a remake..I hear Coppola is making some sort of archetectural bildungsroman flick called Megalopolis that MAY draw on the Fountainhead. I'm thinking Kevin Spacey and ummm..gee who is the modern day counterpart of Patricia Neal? Kate Blanchett when she stops slumming around maybe..And why the hell could they MAKE such adult movies 50 years ago? What have we lost along the way?Its like I.A.L Diamomd once told a Hollywood aidience - the talking picture has come a long way since I broke in..but wh should I depress you?
1,Unintentionally hilarious,"There's much that is amusing -- all unintentionally -- about this movie. The acting is particularly wooden, but given the dialogue that Ayn Rand wrote, it's difficult to see what options the performers had.I have to say that the strangest scene revolves around Howard Roark's trial. After all, his destruction of the buildings can only be described as an act of terrorism, and his defense of his actions reminds me how the Weather Underground described their use of violence in the 1970's. And yet many in the Republican party have come to deify Ayn Rand and her ideas. I never would have believed I would have lived long enough to see such a strange transformation. All hail the revolution!"
5,This movie brings to life an important message.,"Some of the people who critized this movie apparantly have never watched a 40's or 50's movie. In those days actors actually had to have some talent before they would be let on the stage.While this movie is a bit dry, the message it brings is not, and it is the message which makes it interesting. The mentally challenged among us will not understand the plot or the message.The Fountainhead will make you think. I recommend it."
2,The Fountainhead,Being an avid Ayn Rand fan I felt offended By the way the Director changed the personalities of her characters . If you've read her novels you would know that her heroes are anything but emotional . They are strong willed exceptional people who don't over react to adversity. In this movie they are transformed into weaker versions of themselves making my heart drop . I wish the Producers would have had more respect for work !
4,GREAT MOVIE,ONE OLD MOVIE THAT I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED AND I LIKE GARY COOPER IN MOST OF ALL HIS MOVIES. HE WAS A GREAT ACTOR
4,The Fountainhead,"I'm not a big Gary Cooper fan but he absolutely excels as an idealistic architect, probably loosely based on Frank Lloyd Wright. It's fun to watch Patricia Neal as a young beauty. This was a big budget film and had several Hollywood leading people in supporting roles. Filmed in black and white, based on the famous novel of the same name by Ayn Rand."
5,Ayn Rand is a timeless lesson,Ayn Rand is a timeless lesson in personal excellence and the strive for indepence in a world more likely to go with the flow than create it's own path. If you haven't read the book...do so...I live by it! The movie is a nice nutshell reminder of all that should be encompassed in our own individualism.
3,The Fountainhead (The Movie) Review,Movie is from the book by Aynn Rand and the plot follows that of the book closely - considering that she wrote the screen play I guess you should expect that to be the case even though she later claimed to hate the movie. The book took Rand seven years to write and get published without any changes by the publisher's editors and it is much better than the movie. The depth of the characters protraited in the movie is too shallow and the disjunctive scenes makes the movie plot hard to follow.
2,The Disappointment,"Whatever you thought of the book - and I loved it - this film adaptation is a failure. The casting, the screenplay (in which Rand herself had a hand) fail to do the book justice. For the definitive film adaptation of Ayn Rand, I highly recommend the Italian-made ""We The Living""."
3,Ayn Rand vs. Hollywood,"Despite exceptional performances by the cast, avid readers/fans of Ayn Rand will find only superficial similarities between the film and the novel-from which the film was derived. For us ""fans"", the film and novel must be disassociated from each other as different, creative entities in order to be appreciated. It is interesting to note the paralellity between Keating's struggle with the developers in the adherence to Roark's plans for the erection of Cortlndt Homes, with Ayn Rand's struggle with the director in the adherence to her script in the making of this film!"
3,Book Fountainhead,"It is a very old picture, made in 1949.This I knew before buying itThe film met my expectations."
1,Classic or silly melodrama?,"I read this book a couple of decades ago. I knew I was supposed to love it since it's regarded a classic, but I really can't remember if I liked it or not. I just watched the movie and it's really one of the most ridiculous movies of all time. I don't know if it was a bad version of the book or not, but I am certainly not going to waste a second rereading the book to find out. Although I understand the point Ayn Rand made (over and over and over and over), I don't think she was nearly as profound as she apparently thought herself. Gary Cooper was wooden as always, and everyone's dialogue was so corny and overly-dramatic it was hard not to laugh. I bet they had a hoot during filming. Or maybe they were just embarrassed."
5,The best old movie I've seen,"I recently read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged for the first time and found this version of The Fountainhead to be the best old movie I've seen. Granted, I don't watch a tremendous number of old movies, but I really enjoyed and recommend this movie."
4,A classic put on the screen,"Good adaptation of the classic Ayn Rand novel, but there is only so much a film maker can do with a book like The Fountainhead. Gary Cooper gave a 5 star performance, Patricia Neal 4 star. Ayn Rand fans (like me) won't be disappointed."
1,Don't let the tittle fool you.,Cadillac Man is just stupid and boring. In fact there is no reason why this movie is called Cadillac Man. It can't make up its mind to be a drama or a comedy. I don't see the point and the moral. I was even told that there was a climatic car chase near the end but I discovered that they were lying through their teeth. The plot is stale. The steritipical gags are recyled from other TV shows. I can't picture Robin Williams as a womanizing car salesman. His acting for this character is [not nice]and mediocre. If you want to see something better with fantastic acting from Robin Williams then I suggest watching Jumaji or Mrs. Doubtfire...
5,A funny Movie,"This movie was hilarious it was down right witty and funny. Robin Williams, what an actor. He was funny in this movie. I thought Tim Robins was funny to. This movie you gotta see i recomend it."
4,A 1990s classic!!,"Classic Robin Williams - smooth but off-kilt talkin', and Tim Robbins - nervous, confused, but meaning well. Great stuff. Between this and ""Jacob's Ladder,"" Tim Robbins had a good year!"
3,Pretty Funny,This is a relatively funny movie about a car salesman who has several women on the side. The movie turns very serious when williams' and sciorra's lives are threatened by robbins.
3,A Comic Hostage Drama?,"That's the basic problem. This film can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be a comedy or a hostage drama.The acting is really pretty good -- how can it not be with Robin Williams, Tim Robbins and Fran Drescher? But the audience never knows whether to laugh or cry.Five stars for creativity and taking a big chance. Unfortunately it doesn't work."
4,Robin Williams most underrated film,"Robin Williams is so sleazy in this movie that it's easy to dislike the film, but it's a fine performance with great chemistry between him and Tim Robbins. Lots of laughs, and in the end, it turns out to be quite a ""feel-good"" movie. Watch it more than once... it keeps getting funnier!"
5,Great Fun and Excitement!,"I saw this film back in 1990, when it first opened in theatres and I love it. Everything about it is extravagent: music, acting, set, dialouge, and plot. It is a funny yet suspenseful comedy/drama that will make you stick to your seat watching until the very end. Even during the closing credits, I wanted to sit through these to listen to that wonderful ""Cadillac Man"" song. Worth owning for the music alone!"
4,"Many subtle jokes, but hilarious if you get them all","This movie is worth a watch, but only if you are willing to pay attention to the myriad subtle jokes in it.Those who think it only occasionally funny just weren't paying attention to EVERY scene with the hostage negotiation team in the restaurant, and lots of subtle jokes in the dialog between Williams and Robbins, and the phone calls out of the car dealership.This movie took a chance with 'intelligent humor'. Not that the humor is that intelligent, it just doesn't hit you over the head with obvious jokes. It is a take off on the 'real' 'cookie cutter' hostage dramas, and the fun it makes of them is subtle. (For example, the cops' reaction, after disbelieving that Larry has brought explosives taped to his bike, when it is 'revealed' to them that he obtained them in Jersey. There is no over the top joke, but it is VERY funny if you are paying attention and have enough common knowledge to get it)."
5,Bad taste is awesome!,"I was always quite curious about this movie since I heard only good things about it. so I took a chance and bought the limited edition set. Right from the start the movie opens up with excellent blood and gore. A very good move by Peter Jackson, surprisingly the movie gets better and better as more blood and gore come into play. The cheezy atomsphere, low-budget actors, and senseless gore really gives the movie a good sense of humor. Besides the movie, the limited edition dvd is even better. Anchor bay never disappoints you, the transfer is amazing, the sound quality is outstanding as well. The dvd offers surround ex, and 6.1 dts tracks. The movie also comes with the making of Bad taste which also makes the movie well worth your time. For horror fans who love unnecessary gore and low budget actors, deff. buy this without hesistate!"
3,"Reasonably good, but not as funny as expected","I rented this the other night, expecting it to be a good combo of revolting scenes and good humor, like Meet the Feebles and Dead Alive/Braindead.Instead, there was some reasonably good gore (and the green soup scene, ack!) with a lot of dull action scenes near the end of the movie. At the end, I was glad it was done. If it was an hour long, it would have been much better.The second disc documentary was more enjoyable than the movie itself. It showed a lot of the jerry-rigged equipment that was built for this movie, showing off a lot off the inventiveness of Peter Jackson. If this inventiveness had shown up better in the script, I would have been happier.One other question. Why isn't the documentary on the first disc? It definitely feels like it could fit, with the first disc offering no commentary or any complicated special features, and the documentary is only 25 minutes or so."
3,Splattering fun!,"Very few movies leave me with such a weird feeling. First time you watch BAD TASTE you'll wonder what could possibly happen in the next scene. Jackson spent 4 years making a truly wacky zombie flick. It's all played for laughs. However, if you're squeamish about realistic violence then avoid. If dark humor is not your cup of tea then the mid-digit on the box cover should give you all the deterent you need. Keep out of the reach of children and anybody with the nickname ""Psycho"". But for the rest of us twisted souls BAD TASTE is a hilarious splattering good time! Keep it on your shelf beside DAWN OF THE DEAD.Ordinarily BAD TASTE should get 5 stars on the splatter movie scale. I was disappointed in the quality of the VHS transfer. So 3 stars for this reason. Is the DVD any better?"
1,"i bet my input on this gore fest dont count, but here.......","I've seen this movie a dozen or more times and why i keep watching it, i will never no! the fact is the gore is like a must see thing to me, and i bet i will watch it again after i write this! i like movies like this, but leave out the comedy, it makes it a bet stupit to have comedy with horror! anyway's, i watch it only for the gore and not the comedy! it's number 1 in gore and double 0 zero in comedy, horror is not to be laughed at unless your a psycho nut case! just laugh at the comedy and we will get along fine!"
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible, even at 30X","OK OK OK, so I love cheesy, bloody, goofy horror movies like Evil Dead, Basket Case, Dead Alive, etc. This movie, however, is just BAD. I could not bear to watch this. My friend and I popped this in after watching for the 29th time, Dead Alive. After about 20 minutes we watched it in 2X mode, then after a minute of this, 8X mode.....and then finally 30X......we could barely get to the end. Sure the end scene is a laugh and a half, but its not worth the garbage in between. This looks like a parody of Pet Semetary I did in High school.....horrible!Stay away and watch Evil Dead again. I have to rate this as one of the 5 worst movies ever made, and I saw Sweet Home Alabama!"
1,Horrible,"I thought this movie was quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Parts were slightly humorous, but the movie in general had a poor plot, bad acting, and no redeeming value. Definitely not worth the [$$]+..."
1,Worse then evildead ?,"When an army of evil aliens invades earth intending to sell humans as intergalactic hamburger meat, the New Zealand government calls in an elite team of psychotic assassins. But are these boys brutal enough to tackle the vilest villains in the universe? From director Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings), it's the ultimate battle of flying guts, splattering brains, exploding sheep and guzzling vomit.This is a horror-comedy that fails miserably: it's not the least bit suspenseful or funny. The special effects are bad, they are DISASTEROUS!!! Everything in this film is a failure: acting, music, pacing, effects, editing, camera work, etc...A complete and total disappointment."
1,Be warned--this isn't a 2-disc special edition...it's a cheap release,"enough people have reviewed the merits of the movie, I just want to let people know, this particular listing (ASIN: B00004Z1GI ), as of the date of this review, is described by amazon as the 2-disc special edition. It's not. It's a cheapo single disc release by an obscure company, and it pretty much looks like it was transferred from a VHS tape in full screen. Definitely not worth the listed price of 17.99."
3,Kiwi splatter,"Simple , basic blood and guts that anybody can relate to inside their head. Cost bugger all to get to the big screen and had the right affect. Well done Jackson and friends, fagin good."
5,THE OLD MAGIC'S STILL THERE!!!!,"Aaaaaaw geez, where do I begin? Bad Taste just kicks so much [rear] its insane! Everything about it! The gore is over the top and unnecessary! The violence is pointless and blunt! the acting godawful!The humor is darker than a shadow! And you also get a kick out of the accents too! (they are extremely thick). You'll find yourself watching this one over and over and over just because it's so ridiculously violent & funny. This is the perfect movie to put on at a party to make people either puke from the gore, or just puke from laughing so hard! What other movie features a man who falls off a mountain then explodes once his body hits the ground, and here's the funny part about it.....15 minutes later we come back to him and he's still alive! But he blew up didn't he? Yes he did. Does it make any sense at all? No it doesn't. But That's what's so great about this movie, just let your self get lost in one of the coolest cult horror/comedies ever!!!!"
2,Awesome Splatter flick but horrible delivery,"I love this film and was wanting to add it to my collection. However, the day I received this in the mail would not be that day. The disc tabs in the case had broke leaving the disc the slide around while in transit which left horrible, deep scratches all over the disc. Customer service issued a refund and let me reorder it without shipping. Hopefully second time is the charm"
5,GREAT PREMIRE FOR PETER JACKSON!!!!,"This movie is one of the best low buget films ever(along with El Mariachi and Resivoir Dogs). It is violent as hell but in the very funniest ways. Its chessy(but in a good way)and it is amazingly funny. This movie is great, you should give it a chance and rent it at least. Great, Good, Fantastic! What else can i say."
3,lord of the mediocre,"why would i watch this movie? ive loved peter jackson's work for a very long time now,and stumbled upon this movie in a compilation dvd set. i decided to give her a go and found it very amusing, and entertaining, but would i have felt the same if some other director had done it? probably not. i can not warrant a 4 or 5 stars, but i did find it fun to watch knowing the person who created it was to go on create favorites of mine , such as dead alive. thank you for your time."
5,Jackson's a genious.,"Fans of LOTR's who have not seen this gem are in for a surprise. Peter Jackson's first film is a gorefest like no other. Made in my native New Zealand, this is truly true to it's title. The scene with the vomit almost made me sick. Get this one if you love your horror bloody and funny.Bring on the remasters (hopefully at end of the year)."
2,Whoa....,"Funny but not enough to watch again. ""Meet the Feebles"" is much funnier, sicker, and bound to make anyone who ""wants to see the amazing Peter 'Lord of the Rings' Jackson's earlier work"" cringe. I saw it on acid my first time and had to go see ""Star Wars: Special Edition"" in the theater to get my mind off of it. ""Bad Taste"" is for die hard collectors only."
5,Absurd and entertaining.,"Peter - the lord of the rings - Jackson made his directrial debut with this self finaced aliens against us gore feast. Not quite the Evil Dead, but definately a must for fans of the Genre."
2,Brain Dead is heaps better.,"This film will delight the gore fans who havent seen Braindead (Dead Alive) yet.I saw Dead Alive and loved it. And Amazon recomended this movie by the same director. I rented it and was pretty much let down. Aliens come to earth to start a resteraunt for aliens with humans as the main coarse but a couple of goverment alien killers wont allow it to happen.I thought th eacting was pretty bad, the gore effects where ok... but for a real delight in gore, you have to watch PJ's Brain Dead(Dead Alive). It's a much better gore film and actualy has a plot and more entertainment and humour. This one is nothing compared to what came next from Jackson."
1,"Funny. Actually, not really.","This movie is one of the most dull, boring movies that I have ever seen. Although I usually like movies that don't have a decent plot or decent acting, this one just didn't cut it. A major waste of money here."
3,A good movie!,"This is a good movie but not more than that. The beginning is great with Derek and his great quotes like ""Im a Derek, and Dereks dont run"" But in the end it gets a little boring which is sad for a such good start!"
2,WELL......,"I guess the title says it all! There are some pretty disgusting scenes in ""BAD TASTE"", but it's not as interesting of a movie that some say....Buy at your own risk!"
5,non stop gore,this movie has all the gore you could want.I strongly recommend you pick this up if you love movies full of gore.
3,Bad Taste Was,"I thought itn would be like Dead Again, but it was very obvious it was an early attempt at movie,making."
3,just okay,"Not impressed but not unimpressed. Not sure what I expected it to do but no changes, good or bad, to my skin. I like the quick absorption. I thought this was suppose to be more of an all natural type of facial hydrants but it has a rather odd chemically smell to it but it does go away. I am glad I tried it but probably would not repurchase. I did purchase the 4 pack also."
4,A Dream Indeed,"Featured exclusively at the Wynn Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, Le Reve is a mesmerizing above- and underwater spectacular à la Cirque du Soleil.The soundtrack to accompany the show is good, but I wouldn't call it great. About half of the CD leaves little impression. But there is a range from reasonably decent songs (""Between the Lines,"" ""The Tree,"" ""Chapel,"" and ""Against the Moon"") to CD standouts (""Eden,"" ""Dreaming"" (though the lead sounds as if he strains too much to reach the upper register at the end of the song), and the opening ""Overture"", which does a fantastic job of setting the tone for the rest of the CD).If you're into Cirque du Soleil soundtracks, I'd say that Le Reve is better than ""Dralion"" or ""Alegria,"" but not as good as ""Quidam"" or ""O."""
1,The Sokal Hoax Of Experimental Music?,"The Recordings Are Clearly Not Real Instruments. The Rhetoric Is Clearly A Funny Joke. The Emperor Is Naked, The Check Cashed, The Junk Sold, The Story Washed. And Someone Somewhere Must Be Getting Kicks And Making Money. I Enjoyed It."
5,Great writing on an interesting topic,"Booth provides a lucid, interesting view of the Great War, the soldiers, and the situations they found themselves in. Her focus on the architecture of war memorials is fascinating. This is a book that is a must read for anyone who is interested in World War I and its consequences for all of us."
3,Atomic Fireballs,"Unlike the other tired poseurs on this recording, Atomic Fireballs elevate the album from the depths of embarassment. Singer John Bunkley's demonic Armstrong-cum-Waits voice could call Dr. Faustus from the depths of hell and back to the bar again for another shot of whiskey. The band has incredible energy, are talented songwriters, and are really the prime movers and shakers that make this album tolerable. The remainder is fluff material."
4,Great service,"I havent use this sheet, my twins will be born next month. But the service was excellent, great price and arrived pretty soon."
3,Really 20$? ummm,"You need it you need it right? But really 20$? I cant dry it in the dryer, it needs ironing to get the wrinkles out and I could have saved the money. I only really needed the one that came with the co sleeper and I use the gerber water proof pads to protect from accidents. My baby is 4 weeks but in another 8 months I may need them... I will update then... But I doubt it, lol... I am a first time Mom and a minimalist."
3,co-sleeper sheets,"The shipping was quick. The colors are pretty but the sheets themselves are not soft. That was disappointing to my daughter who I bought the sheets for and of course to me. They are not inexpensive so I expected more. I purchased five sheets to go with the co-sleeper I bought her for their first baby. We have not assembled the co-sleeper yet but when I received it the box was all torn and dented. Looking at it the contents looks okay, but we will see when the my son in law puts it together."
5,love it!!!,love having her so close!!!!!! allows for good interaction & easy reach for breast feeding
2,King size pillow cases works great.,"I purchased an arms reach co-sleeper and nearly choked when I saw the price of the sheets. My mom told me to try a king size pillow case and it fit like a glove. So instead of paying 20 bucks with shipping, I spent 10 dollars for a pack of two king size pillow cases at a local store. They fit perfect and now I can get more for the buck."
1,This is not a savings!,The list price is incorrect as you can purchase this sheet from the manufacturer for just one cent more at USD 15.00. You are NOT saving 25%! You also have a much better choice of colors if you purchase from the manufacturer.
3,Mediocre quality,"I purchased a total of 4 of these, thinking I needed to change the bedding constantly due to spit up.The instructions said to hang dry only so I thought I needed more to get through the week. It turns out I can just toss it in the dryer and put it right back on the mattress.Had I known I didn't need to hang dry, I wouldn't have purchased any extra and just went with the 2 they gave me when I purchased the cosleeper.The material is average, nothing special. It holds up well to lots of washes and uses."
5,Soneone To Watch Over Me,"Great police spoof. Tom Berenger made a good cop in this love affair, body guard for Mimi Rogers. A good Ridley Scott movie to own."
1,Crap,"Wouldn't play had some kind of message that the region wasn't compatible,then it shouldn't be sold in the U.S. never order from this company again!"
1,Fake Widescreen by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,"Review for: ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" (1987)Studio: Sony Pictures Home EntertainmentDVD Release Date: October 19, 1999The Widescreen is a Fake Widescreen. They took the Pan and Scan Full Screen Movie Issue (which has the ends of the movie image cut off) and cropped off the top and bottom of the movie to make it conform to the aspect ratio of 1.85:1 for Widescreen TVs."
5,GREAT,"Just a great movie, I would like to know where I can get the sound track of it?? Does any one know? Would appreaciate an answer."
3,Not an great Ridley Scott film,"Out of all of the Ridley Scott movies that I have seen, this is the worst of them. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good movie, but compared to Gladiator or Blade Runner this is nothing. I'm also not a big fan of Tom Berenger, he doesn't seem to come off very believable in his movies and that is why he only does straight-to-video movies now. Mimi Rogers is all right, she seemed like a real person in a real situation. The story is also well developped, my only problem was the length of the film which is approximately 95 minutes. Other Ridley Scott films that you should check out if you liked this: White Squall, Thelma & Louise and G.I. Jane."
2,another waste of time forget me movie,"The premise: woman sees murder murderer chases her and tries to kill her police watch her and protect her.But the actual movie plot was about a family man who lusts after a woman and a shallow life of things and money. He is ""seduced"" by it. So he wrecks his family in the process.That's pretty much it. Not much more too it. I mean Mimi Rogers plays the rich bee well . . . . She looks the part. The manhattan apt is beautiful, even by today's standards. Berenger has a good accent going. I mean you could have seen/heard that in a 5 minute behind the scenes audition tape. There wasn't even any suspense. Even the ""suspenseful"" parts didn't have you on the edge of your seat.So why bother?"
5,Great Movie,"This movie has a little bit of everthing. Romance, intrigue, drama. This film is definately worth seeing and owning. You will find your self relating to the characters in the movie. This is a film you will watch over and over again."
3,"Watch this for Berenger, Bracco, and Rogers","This is an enjoyable movie if you ignore the simple-minded and logic-deficient ""thriller"" plot (would that brutal guy REALLY be permitted to run around the city for that long, repeatedly trying to kill witnesses??) and just concentrate on the nicely drawn characterizations of the three main protagonists, with their genuinely complicated emotional dilemmas. Also, the cinematography and music are top notch, as is the image quality of the DVD."
5,This pouch is no slouch,"Legendary McGuire Nicholas strength. Perfect for the non-corporate look. Roomy enough to snugly hold my Treo 650. Belt loop design works waaay better than the metal clip on style of the many black leatherette,office boy types. Here is the major difference.When the spring metal clip types get bumped,often they 'spring' off your belt sending your phone to the floor. Plus, the McGuire overflap (is that a word?) is velcro controlled so it is easy to open. Neat little product."
4,Pleasant beverage but too expensive,"I liked this product, but I think it's too expensive. Just pour some juice in your seltzer water and it comes close enough."
3,Secrets are to be Told,"In this book for children, a young boy named Wyatt seems to be just not old enough and he trys andtrys but with no success to be noticed. People are always telling this boy to be quiet. Well you know how hard it is to be quiet.This young boy just stops talking all together and things are lost, ruined, and thing are just simply a mess. Well when a truck is about to drive over a little puppy Wyatt just can't stay quiet anymore. And from then on people are glad to hear him talk but he still hears quiet Wyatt once and a while.This book was written by: Bill Maynard and illustrated by Frank Remkiewicz."
4,The Heart Speaks,This book provides validation of what I have believed for many years about stress and its relationship to disease. Also how meditation and mindfullness can help in healing.
2,too tough,"I ordered this jerky because I wanted to try a new flavor and ""sweet & hot"" sounded pretty tasty. As it turns out the flavor was actually pretty good, but the jerky itself was tough and some pieces were literally inedible because my teeth simply could not bite through it. I'm no jerky expert so I'm not sure if this means the jerky was stale or not, but if I can't chew it I'm not ordering it again. If you don't mind rock hard jerky this product is for you!"
2,False Advertising,"I was very surprised to receive only a set of spinners with my shipment. The photo, which displays dice and game pieces, is false advertising, and very misleading.I am quite unhappy with my purchase. I think I paid too much for a small pack of spinners."
2,dollar store?,"This was the only set of spinners that I could locate. Upon receipt of the package, I immediately had a flash of looks like a dollar store item. Way overpriced in my honest opinion. Reminds me of the govt. overpaying for items; the school systems are probably their #1 customer. The six individual spinners are black plastic and backing is thin cardboard. Hope they will function satisfactorily for teenagers playing dominoes."
5,LUCKY!,"This book was read to me every day in grade 7 English class. My son, grade 8, started reading it. He had a hard time with the cowboy words. People don't watch cowboy shows like they used did years ago."
4,Worked for me,"I bought this book after I had volunteered to coach a Pinto League (7-8 yr old) team that my son was on. This book provided a good starting point for getting organized and creating a good practice worksheet. Sound baseball fundamentals, being organized and having fun in a supportaive environment lead to a successful and happy Little League experience."
4,Works like a manual,"I want to be sure I'm leading my son with good advice and there are great drills, suggestions and ideas for teams in the book. If you want some guidance, even if your not a coach, this is a good book."
4,review,the book came in excellent packing and well before time. with regards to the book i think it is really awesome. the stuff is very well explained and supported with good examples
1,Horrible,"I was very disappointed with this purchase and would suggest not to purchase from this company. The book that I thought I was purchasing,the book that was listed and cover shown, was not the book I received. They sent me the international edition that is not the same. The homework problems are different. Will never buy from this place again!!"
3,A practical guide for the manager,"I first used this book as a student-I found it useful then, today I insist that all managers reporting to me review, and use, the concepts and techniques provided by the authors.The book is useful, in that concepts are well explained, the examples are relevant, but most important for me is that it provides managers who have little or no experience in determining project costs with a handy means (including formulae and worked examples) of doing so.I have tried to get copies of the most recent edition, the popularity seems to be such that the book is sold out. I most readily recommend this to anyone who needs to justify capital expenditure, who needs to do project costing, and who has to prepare proposals for submission to the boss (or the board of directors)in order to obtain funds for capital expansion, refurbishment or simply equipment upgrades."
3,Good material.,"I am learning a lot of useful material out of this book. I would recommend it to anyone that isn't afraid of a little math. The only problem I have with the book is in the construction. I bought the 15th and the 14th editions, the 15th arrived with the pages separated from the cover so I sent it back, while the 14th was beginning to separate. I believe this is a manufacturing problem because the pages are held to the cover by four sheets of thick paper, I think if they would have glued the spine to the cover there would be no problems during shipping or normal use. Ship this book with caution."
4,Very good reading!,"The best book in engineering economics that I have seen so far. Easy reading, easy to digest the material. My only ""complaints"" is that the ""answer to questions"" (in the back of the book) should include cash flow diagrams, and the templates on the CD should be formatted to look professional.Minor glitches to a great book!"
5,This is a Must Have--Especially if you are a student of Astrology,"Frances Sakoian's The Astrology of Human Relationships is a must have for any Astrologer. She goes through all the planet/sign combinations with their aspects in the book, describing indepth, the good and the bad of compatibility between two charts. Of course you must have a basic understanding of the signs, planets and what conjunctions, trines, squares, etc., are. It puts a new spin on what ""A's Mercury conjunct B's Uranus"" means as well as well as what ""A's Venus in B's fourth house"" means. I would recommend this book to anyone studying Astrology. It is definitely a book for my library."
1,Ridiculous Delivery Schedule.,The product itself is good but after ordering it 7 weeks ago we still have not received it.
1,No difference in computer screens,"The dust cloth might be able to remove dust from computer screens, but I needed it to remove ""dirt and smudges"" as it claims to do. I tried it on a desktop monitor and my laptop with no success on either. I would not recommend this product."
1,bizarrely awful,"I really can't imagine what the authors of this book were thinking. The tests they present are almost completely unlike the real GRE in question style, selection, and difficulty. A verbal test here, for instance, will have two reading passages crammed at the end, each of which is only a paragraph or two long and written at a high school level. The real GRE has much longer passages, which are far more complicated and include nuanced questions of intent and meaning. You won't find that here. Download POWERPREP from the GRE site and get the Princeton Review book. Those are tools with some real relevance to the GRE..."
5,Preschool for Homeschoolers and Others,"As a homeschooling family, we have chosen to bypass day care, preschool, and traditional school. This book reinforced our views on maintaining the special parent-child bond in childhood while incorporating the stimulating environment our children need for their mental, physical, social, and emotional development. This book won't sit on the shelf."
4,Fun book!,"This book has been helpful to me with my 3 preschoolers! What I use it for most is the abundance of activity ideas. I can almost always find an activity to do with the kids using item we have around the house (empty egg cartons, markers, glue, straws, leaves, rubber bands, etc.). They always enjoy doing the activities, and I enjoy that the activities are so easy and inexpensive!"
1,Enh,I love to read. I read all the time. I did not love this book. They could have gotten thier points accross in a much more consise manner.
4,A very good historical movie,"To Elba and back again in a very short and very bloody time the old general went.That there are elements of ""luck"" in the outcome of the battle of Waterlooseems to point out the chaotic in history.What struck me after the fact was how little regard for human life waspart of the thought process: that individual soldiers could have been protected better seem obvious. Trying to keep soldiers alive led tothe later trench warfare of WWI.Napoleon literally bleed France dry with his Russian war and all his conquests: all in the name of glory Empire in the Roman image.I liked the movie and wish more such movies were made."
3,"Great history, average acting, substandard DVD","This DVD is a straight VHS transfer that has been made widewcreen by cutting off top and bottom sections of standard format. The quality is average and in opening sequences the audio is poor.The acting is average and Steiger not entirely believeable as Boney.While starting out somewhat slow, the movie itself is very thorough and historically accurate and probably the best there is at covering the history of 18 June 1815.Military history fans will undoubtedly enjoy this film despite any shortcomings."
3,Not a good transfer,"I have this on VHS and its great. I burned a copy to my DVD and it still looked good. For some reason this purchased DVD looks worst then my DVD copy. The colors are more muted and the widescreen looks small. Love the movie so why can't they do a better DVD. On the other hand, the service from supplyer69 was great"
2,DVD-Waterloo-,"Bought it on a ""spur"", but was not really enthused by this movie. Would not really recommend it if you are a ""fan"" of the period!"
1,Do not purchase this junk,I have no idea as to the quality of the film because the dvd that was sent was totally defective and would not play. Do not purchase this junk.
5,"""A Great Epic Battle Film""",This is one of the best classic war movies ever made!!! I was very happy to find this movie here on Amazon now on DVD format!!! A Must see!!!
5,waterloo,"Excellent depiction of the battle of waterloo . Good acting with Rod Steiger(Napoleon) and Christopher Plummer(Wellington) and many others depicting the historical participants. The film gets into some of the politics of the time but is principally a historical epicshowing the battle with its cast of thousands. The battle sequences are excellent and historically accurate. Bonderchuk directed, as he did War and Peace with the battle of Borodino. Excellent film."
2,Quality of dvd,"The movie is great!!! A movie not to be missed by history buffs. The delivery was on time as usual for Amazon shipments.Unfortunately the quality of this dvd is VERY poor. The picture is blurry, sound is terrible. It looks like a movie that was filmed by someone at a theater and then burned to a DVD. Only reason for two stars is the movie and the actors.......guess I should have read posted reviews to see if anyone else had problems with the quality of the DVD."
4,I'm glad it is over,"it was probably too realistic on the WWI details for my taste. I was soo sick of rats and mud at the end, but so were the real solidiers, I suppose."
2,disappointed,"I am a big Anne Perry fan. I really enjoyed the first book in this series. I felt, however, that each succeeding book was just more of the same: life in the trenches, Joseph solving a mystery, and platitudes about the necessity of holding on to the war for the sake of Jolly Old England.I was frankly really bored by the end of the series."
5,and the first shall be last,"I like all the detail. Perhaps some would find it sluggish, but I like the style and the ""picture it paints"". Although this is the first of a series, it was the last book of the series that I ""read"". The orator is suberb."
3,I did go to sleep,"Anne Parry's series set in WWI began as an enthralling tale of murder and espionage. Unfortunately, there is only so much mud and blood one can absorb before interest lags and the tale becomes repetitive and tiresome. Her four part series could easily have been shortened to three."
5,A page turner,A wonderful ending for this series. Ann Perry kept you guessing throughout. The series on the whole was excellent...and I read all her books.
3,The End,"And so it ends; the book, the series, the war. With some element of drama, this book was one of the better ones of the series. Very soon, we will be marking the 100th anniversary of the start of WWI. Accordingly, we will be finding a good deal more works of fiction and non-fiction about the Great War. For the readers of popular fiction, this series will be marked as one of the better ones."
2,Very lightweight... not as good as it sounds,"I purchased this for my 8 year old 2nd grader. Its very lightweight and doesnt seem of very good quality materials. I should have went for a bit more expensive one. 2 of the slides were broken also. Thats no fun, especially when only a few came with it and the other set of 15 that we ordered didnt arrive until over one month later."
2,Got What She Paid For,"My daughter, 11, decided she wanted this microscope because it looked functional and wasn't that expensive. She loves it. However, it's tricky to use and requires an experienced microscope user to adjust the light, because the lamp isn't properly focused. The little slides are poorly made and have so many bubbles that it's difficult to tell what's in the field, much less learn anything about it. We had much more fun making our own samples and viewing them on real slides (it is powerful enough to see red blood cells, but not much stronger).It serves its purpose, and I love to hear ""can I have a sample of that?"" It's a good learning tool for a careful child. My 5-year-old likes this microscope too, but he gets a little too excited around it and the light doesn't stay put well enough for all that bouncing."
2,First microscpe,"I purchased this microscope for my 8 year old daughter. It is very nice, and sturdy but the magnification is really not that great. A lot of slides come with the microscope which is nice but because the magnification is mediocre, they are virtually useless without proper lighting. I wished I would've have purchased a more expensive model."
3,Missing parts,I read this in paper years ago and loved it. It's still fun but the Kindle copy appears to be missing or have truncated certain parts. Either that or my memory is gone. One classic scene is altered so you miss the punchline.
3,Still 3 out of 5 stars. Stretching my rating a little.,I just saw Corvette Summer again last Saturday night on Speedvision. My predicted rating hasn't changed much. Bruce Dern making his own personal comments while cruising down Sunset Boulevard in his very cherry blue '58 Olds convertible.I will say Annie Potts still makes a very likeable hooker though.Altogether a pretty good Lost-Drive-In flick.Lost-Drive-In - Sat. night 8 P.M. PST. Speedvision... Be sure to have your barf bag handy.Don't blame me if you didn't get to watch it.
4,"Corvette Summer is one of my ""Guilty Pleasures""....","I think another customer review said ""I just can't stop watching it!"" That's how I feel. No, it's not a great film, but there IS something about this film that draws you in and won't let go! After watching this movie, I realized how underrated Mark Hamill is as a comic actor. He and Annie Potts were a great comedy team. They should have made many sequels to this film. Too bad it wasn't successful enough for that."
5,Great movie,"Great movie, fun, easy to get lost in, very original plot, story is engaging, comedy is fresh. There's just nothing bad about this movie. And when I first heard Mark Hamill was in this movie, I thought oh that's stupid. He's Luke Skywalker, this isn't going to work. Wow, I was so wrong! This movie only proved Mark Hamill was not typecast and could do a great job playing other leading roles. I did not see Luke Skywalker in this movie, but a very talented and capable Mark Hamill. Very refreshing, and I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. It's great to be able to watch and enjoy it again 30 years later."
3,Corvette Summer (70's riced out Stingray??),"Yeah the car is gawdy as hell, but back when I was a kid and a confirmed car freak (still am!), it was the holy grail of movie cars. A good cast with a good script. It is a little low budget movie, but it should appeal to the car nuts, and vintage Vegas buffs. The big chase scene at the end is pretty good, but hands down the funniest scene in the movie is Kenny on a 10 Speed actually trying to catch the Vette.Bottom line, not the best car movie ever, but a top 20 pick in the same line as Hollywood Knights, American Graffiti, Two Lane Black Top, and Vanishing Point."
3,It was okay!,"The only reason I saw this movie was because Mark Hamill was in it. I couldn't help to laugh the first time I saw him. It was a okay movie. I also couldn't believe that it was PG. But I guess back then that is how the rating went. There are a few cool car chasing scenes. If you like cars, this is the movie for you. And if you like Star Wars, this is the movie for you."
3,great 70's flick,luke skywalker as somebody else. i can still remember my older brother taking me to see this so many years ago. big star wars fan so anything with luke in it i had to see. great 70's flick. reminds me of the old days
4,"a fun, fun, fun movie...","I just remember seeing this at 2 am in 1994 and I've loved it ever since. Just the classic tale of a boy's, well, man's, well, man-boy's first love on the trail of the thiefs who lifted the Corvette he built. A ton of fun, highly recommended."
3,The Original Flamingo Kid,"This comedy is a must for your collection, if only to see Mark Hamill and Annie Potts looking so young. Hamill is the wide-eyed kid coming of age in Vegas as he chases down his dream car and his dream girl. If you think the Vette is cool, check out Annie's van!""Star Wars"" fans will get a kick out of seeing Hamill in his 'young Luke' stage, as this movie was filmed prior to his car accident."
2,"Luke Skywalker is looking for a ""Little Red Corvette"" and falling for a hooker","After Star Wars became the greatest phenomeon in Hollywood history and Mark Hamill shot to stardom as the legendary Luke Skywalker, he returned to the big screen in a less known adventure film from 1978 called ""Corvette Summer"" Hamill stars as car loving teen who cruises around Las Vegas looking for his red corvette he made from wreckage and he meets and falls for a good hearted,but a little horny teenage prostitute wannabe played by Ghostbusters' Annie Potts. The two teens fall for each other and gets his hot wheels back. it's an okay movie, nothing special, but not a bad movie, I've seen much worse from Tom Green to David Spade. If you love Star Wars, give it a try for another film credit of Mark Hamill."
5,Next Stop Van Nuys Blvd!!!!,"I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD FOR-EVER! This is the REAL Boogie Nights! One of the ultimate 70s pop culture films without a doubt and a unique twist on a classic coming of age story. It's still a heck of a lot of fun. I actually didn't see it until several years after Star Wars came out, but Mark Hamill IS Kenny--I mean he may not be the greatest actor in the world but he pulls off a great performance with this movie."
3,A good dopey-funny movie,"This is one of those artifacts that you saw years ago and thought it was good, and then see it again to realize it wasn't as risque or daring and you remember as a kid. (Annie Potts as a hooker?) Anyway, it's one of those 1970's style comedy action movies to while away a rainy Sunday afternoon. Not great, but a nice time-filler."
3,One Of Few,"This is one of very few Van Damme movies one can actually sit through without falling asleep or laughing to death. Much of its success has to do with Moore's multiple appearances which keep the audience interested.Van Damme has a lot of kids to look after and he wants to give them a better life. He decides to sign up for a championship fight involving one fighter for each country. The prize of course goes to the last man standing.This film is plagued by the typical rudimentary plot for these types of screenplays and, as always, is crowded with bad actors sounding even worse because of a worthless script. The fighting scenes were O.K. but nothing compared to a Bruce Lee or Jet Li film. Again, the most delightful part of the film is Roger Moore whose character is both a helper and a scoundrel at the same time."
1,Avoid this one!,"I have one thing to say about this movie: NEVER, EVER PUT A CLOWN ON STILTS AND HAVE IT START KICKING PEOPLE, especially if it's Jean-Claude!!! END"
3,Dissapointment..needed more work!!!,"what do u get when u let a international superstar like van damme direct a movie?? A very dissapointing movie.....The story itself wasn;t that great. Van damme is a clown on the streets taking care of homless kids and is chased away by cops to move elsewhere. Soon he escapes on a cargo ship and then goes on a ""Quest"" to find the lost city and attain the golden dragon....the action and fighting scenes were short and not intense as they used to be... and on top of all that the ending was a dissapointment too becuase van damme didn't even get the golden dragon. Van damme should just stick to fighting and not directing..I gave this three stars just because Iam huge fan of van damme....i reccomend u see his top quality movies such as double impact, bloodsport, kickboxer, deathwarrant, and maxium risk..."
5,Jean Claude's Best Movie!,"Although the story was a ripped-off, this movie is excellent overall. A quality production and bravo on the directing!"
2,It's so silly!!!,"Really BAD movie with really BAD actor. Van Damme is always trying to do something cool, but he can't. He don't have sense of humor, he don't have any talent, he don't have artistic tastes. The only thing he has is muscles. But who cares? This movie is one big fight. Everything between fightings is dumb and unfunny waste. Bad. Not one star, but really bad."
1,One of Van Damme's Worst Movies,"The Quest was one of the movies that began the descent of Jean-Claude Van Damme from a major motion picture star into a straight-to-video movie star, which still is better than most actors accomplish, but far from the level that Van Damme achieved at the height of his success.The Quest is a poor ripoff of Bloodsport and Kickboxer about a martial arts tournament with Roger Moore thrown in for comic relief. While there are some good fight scenes, they don't make this film worth watching or buying. Fortunately, Jean-Claude made many more that are worth watching."
2,Poor,"I'm a Van Damme fan but this movie sucks real bad, only good parts are the fight scenes at the end of the movie, perhaps the last 10 or 15 minutes. Buy it only if you can get it for like 7 bucks."
1,Good God,"This movie is Bloodsport minus the entertaining parts. Better production value- much worse script. Much worse everything almost. So if you liked Bloodsport which even at its cheesiest was a classic entertaining martial arts flick and you wanted to see another version of it that sucks but has more scenery, well here you go! Enjoy!"
3,"Good movie, mediocre DVD","For Van Damme fans, this is a good one. Full of interesting locations, and big arena martial arts, it's a movie that aims for an epic and old-world feel. With it's budget, it mostly succeeds. It's also unique in that it's Van Damme's directorial debut, and he acquits himself well with good performances from his cast and lush photography.As for the DVD, there are no special features (maybe a trailer?), but be warned the transfer in NON-ANAMORPHIC. That's the most disappointing part of it, but at least it's widescreen."
4,Fascinating Fighters Make This Just Plain Fun,"Although it took four viewings before I finally lowered my rating of this from ""5"" to ""4 stars,""I suspect I will still watch this lame-brain action flick a few more times and enjoy it.Why? Because it offers a great mixture of fascinating fighters, is a modern-day martial-arts action film with almost no swearing and no sex; and offers some tremendous scenery in the first half of the film as Jean Claude Van Damme and company travel to the Far East for this ""World's Greatest Fighter"" tourney.Yes, the tourney gets carried away in the final bout but you can't have everything just right. The photography is magnificent, far better than you would expect. The movie benefits from a classy actor like Roger Moore joining the cast, too. Yeah, it's stupid in parts, but it's fun and highly recommended for first-time viewers who don't know the outcome of the bouts."
2,Close but no cigar Van Damme,The Quest is Van Damme's atempt at a comeback going back to the films where he was staright into fighting and not playing a cop or any like that. The film has okay fight sequnces but the storyline is a little murky and the fianl does drag a little. But still better than the two previous Van Damme films which were Sudden Death and Maximum Risk.
5,Very good martial arts movie,"I found this movie very captivating. The whole tournament was very interesting and entertainment. I would recommend this movie to any martial arts fan and even some who arent. It really feels like a much more cinamatic experience than other Van Damme flicks, he should direct more movies in the future.And interesting note, the guy who played the big tough Sumo in the film participated in a UFC event, and got (beat) by a much smaller opponent. So it is unrealistic in some aspects, but still a great movie."
3,Avarge martial arts action,"Van Damme aint a great actor but he can kick nicely. ""The Quest"" is solid but dull action that entetains you... but doesen't give much more! Worth a look."
3,WOW!!!.......is what i thought at first,"after reading all of the editorial reviews, thought,wow i think this is just a great movie!!!so i rented it(didn't wanna spend 15 bucks on a movie without seeing it first)the begginning started out great:action,exitement.then it kind of slowed down.the actual matches were way too short at the end.i didn't like the music either.this is a once a month movie (watch it once-a-month)"
1,Van Damme has new Quest: find better ideas...,"When you see the movie cover you will think that this is a Bloodsport movie. In a way it is, but it doesn't really get there until the SECOND half of the film. It starts with an old Van Damme telling a story of how he learned to fight, but doesn't even go there. This movie goes from how he escapes New York to becoming a prisoner on a pirate ship, then getting with Roger Moore and his idiot sidekick. They go from one island to the next and end up at a fighting tournament, which is not long at all. I swear this is just like Bloodsport: though Van Damme doesn't do any real cool moves, a bunch of fighters from around the world competing to win. The prize: a giant solid gold statue. I'd like to see anyone even move something like that. The only original idea this movie has is the fact that each fighter is representing not themselves, but their country. Still, this movie sucks."
3,"four average stories, but one's a keeper...","Five authors contribute to this volume. I bought it intitally because I knew Jayne Anne Krentz, but her chapter is one of the weakest. Indeed, four of the five stories are pretty average, and definitely not keepers - but the fifth one...Linda Howard's Lake of Dreams is a haunting, romantic, sexual tale which is definitely worth tracking down. I read the other stories once only, but I've reread Lake of Dreams many times and it is definitely a keeper... So buy all five, but you'll keep it for the one."
2,A lot to read but not as much to see,Photography improves as you see more pictures and read the different techniques behind them. Unfortunately the photos in this book (only 40 of them) are not the ones I would like to shoot or appreciate if I see in a magazine or in a competition. If the printing quality of the photos were better this could have been a better book.
4,Enjoyable show.,"I really enjoy watching Wicked Tuna! Not only is it a local bunch of guys, it can be intense and funny. Well done NatGeo."
4,An important book,"I think that this book paired with the older Addicted to Mediocrity make a powerful tandem for any Christian. Schaeffer's book presents the premise that Christians should be the best instead of the worst in the arts and in other fields. Briner presents a case for Christians letting their lives and voices be heard graciously, wisely, and powerfully in our culture.The book is not a lengthy one. It doesn't need to be. Briner has some things to say and he says them without beating around the bush. His real life examples are striking and convincing. This is a book that can help Christians have an influence for great good."
4,A great and challengin read....,"Though only slightly dated, still a very relevant, challenging and thought-provoking book. May we each learn to find our personal voice and place to ""roar."""
4,A fabulous book on faith and the arts,"Christians seem so often to create their own sub-culture of culture--Christian music, Christian books, etc. Briner exhorts people of faith to produce their very best work to the glory of God, but in the mainstream where everyone can be impacted. As a Christian and an artist who tries (sometimes with more success than others) to combine serving God and creating art, this book really inspired me to keep striving to do and be my best."
4,A brilliant argument,"Even though Mr. Briner's personal theology is a little conservative for me, his overall message is dead on. Christians can do much, much more by using their God-given talents to create beauty instead of screeching like lunatics, or worse, sticking their heads in the sand. I'm just sorry that his untimely death kept us from enjoying more from this good man."
3,decent.,I got this book soon after ordering and it was a great price for something I had to read for freshman orientation.
4,Monty Python meets The Twilight Zone,"If you find Python's ""Undertaker sketch"" and ""Black Knight scene"" hilarious, and enjoy the strange storylines of classic Twilight Zone episodes, then you'll get a kick out of this off-the-wall black comedy.Ed is sold on a sales pitch by a mysterious man in a white suit (I think he also sold Springfield a monorail) that will bring his beloved dead mother back to life. Alas, things don't go especially well and Ed soon finds his reborn mother chasing dogs down the street with a chainsaw.Great casting with Steve Buscemi as mama's boy; Ned Beatty as his peeping Tom uncle; and Sam Jenkins as the beautiful new-girl-next-door."
4,An early Buscemi movie. And one of his best.,"I saw Steve Buscemi at a party last year, and told him that ""Ed and His Dead Mother"" was one of my all-time favorite comedies. I said I was surprised that it didn't take off. He said, ""Some films just don't make it."" Attribute that more to the marketing than the nature of the film or its provacative title. Watch it a couple of times. A little dark comedy is good for the soul."
3,unable to enjoy because seller sold a BAD dvd,would love to be able to watch without it skipping but seller sold bad DVD and wont do anything about it beware !!
2,"Ho, ho?","I thought that this would be one of those hilarious over the top B-films like the ones that Ed Wood made in the dark days of Hollywood. Well, it wasn't very funny at all. It attempted to be 'racy' with some love scenes, but they are so wholesome as to not fit into the purported theme of the movie. Overall, it was a crowning disappointment."
1,A derivative DOG of a movie.,"Peter Jackson would be rolling over in his grave... if he were dead.This movie doesn't merely give a nod to Jackson's horror-comedy classic ""Dead Alive"" (1992) (aka ""Brain Dead""), it steals liberally from it but lacks any of the charm or over-the-top gore of its predecessor.In short, avoid this dog LIKE THE PLAGUE."
4,Lost Black Comedy,This movie was not even in my radar till I did some research one day. All the reviews are pretty dead on. The performances by the actors are top notch. Considered a Dark Comedy in the lines of Fargo meets The Big Labowski meets The Burbs with an undertone of zombie horror. If you are a fan of these type movies then you will for sure dig this under rated and under appreciated gem.
3,Buscemi is great in the lead role,"I rented this movie thinking it would be a bad movie, but because of the great Steve Buscemi i went for it, and it wasnt that bad at all. The premise is silly and some comedy aspects of the film dont necessarily work, but Buscemi and Ned beatty are really good in their respective roles. If your a steve buscemi fan, dont miss this one."
4,Great style,"I wear this underneath my lo rise tight jeans with a crop top. Since the thong is the higher rise style, it shows its sides and back above the jeans in a very sexy and stylish way, it is also not binding to the bottom part too and I feel comfortable all day wearing it. I would buy a few more pairs."
1,Nice one time,"This was nice one time, but on laundering with other delicates dissolved and was unwearable a second time."
4,Six men improvising for you,"Who said there was nothing new under the sun? I give thanks every day to whatever turned me on to Ivo Papasov and these chaps are almost in the same category. Their scene is improvising electric/acoustic jazz with a taste of the leader's Greece. Exaras was born in Thessaloniki in the Macedonia prefecture of Greece, not far from fabled Thrace, the home of history's Orpheus. His instruments are the hollow body and classical guitars and his head is not in Missisippi. Oh no, he is an improviser who listens and plays in a style a little like george Benson and a lot like himself. It works quite nicely with Exaras, clarinetist Bournias and percussionist Tuncboyacian providing the Balkans taste. Bournias even trots out the zurna, a double reed Balkans bagpipe.I won't go on and on about the CD. If it sounds like your thing, buy it."
2,Good but weak story.,"Although the animation was good (it reminded me of Disney) and the alternate universe presented was imaginative, the story itself wasn't much, kinda on the level of a Saturday morning kids cartoon."
4,This is an action movie with a little bit of a twist.,"The plot is a nice idea: blind martial artist. The writers, and especially Rutger Hauer, have fun with it, and the fun comes right across :-)"
2,Very uneasy mix of action and comedy,"This film combines these two genres and is kind of unsuccessful.There are some interesting action scenes and it does capture the essense of the late '80's action flicks very well,but you're thankful at the end of how short it is."
2,Poor,"This is really rather poor. Rutger Hauer does a pretty good blind man but his magical sword powers are way over the top. What this reminded me of was the Clint Eastwood ""Every way..."" films where Clint continually humilates and beats the living daylights our of a gang of hells angels. The trouble is those films weren't taking themselves very seriously. I got the impression that this was.There are a few a nice humerous exchanges between Hauer and the young lad, but overall this was a disappointment. I strongly recommend renting first. If you must buy, only buy if its very cheap."
5,LOVE IT!,"I got this on time & in great shape. I loved this movie from years ago & I wasn't disappointed when I saw it again. (Usually I don't like older movies' quality.) Great movie, great story, great speed of delivery. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys action movies."
1,"Hwang Jang Lee, better image when he's the silver fox...","Very, very disappointing flick here...! The director must've been stuck on stupid...; he had no concept or idea as to what he was doing. Hwang Jang Lee, is great to watch only when he's the Silver Fox --- superb martial arts techniques he possesses, but very undemonstrative here in this flick. The film does him an injustice on his image. Then again, I kinda wanna believe this was one of his earlier days starting out in the movie business, 'cause he seems very unsophisticated and unpolished as he's not in his later movies such as Invincible Armour, and the Silver Fox triologies. Too bad though...; it's just not worth it."
1,NO GOOD,"This head gear was probably the worst head gear I have ever used. You would think it's such a basic thing seeing as they are all the same. This head gear literally flew off my head every time I got hit, when I finally got just right it would still spin around my head with every punch. I wish I would have kept the packageing so I could have returned it."
1,Don't even think about it,"If you are looking for a good sturdy rollerskate, x out now. I broke my foot with this thing. Don't trust it."
2,OK I guess,"It was interesting, but was all about the history of ambulances, which was very interesting. But as an EMS professional, I feel it should have concentrated on the technology in modern ambulances at least a little.Ambulances- Doing the same stuff as doctors, but at 60MPH!!"
1,TERRIBLE is too nice,This CD was awful. This is some gum smacking pathetic excuse for House music. I threw the CD away as soon as I got it home. There was nothing sexy about any of the songs. The music is overwhelmed with too many cheesy lyrics.
3,move 'em out,"yes, i bought another way too expensive shirt, but i am a nerd. i probably won't order another one until the shirts cost $12 or less. they did send it very quickly, though..."
3,nice finish but loosens when fully extended,The install is straight forward. The finish is excellent. However the set screw that holds the mirror from sliding in/out loosens often when the mirror is fully extended. I've already replaced the set screw cause I started to strip the hex head trying to tighten it enough to keep it from coming loose.When it's loose it can't slide off (nice design) but it vibrates enough so you can't always see what you want. It seems to stay tight when it's fully retracted.
3,Works but difficult to keep in place.,Product works but it took some extra work to keep it from moving when going down the highway. Also mirror angle was different than original mirrors. Had to do a lot of extra work and modify to make it work.
5,Review of slide-out CIPA mirror,"It may be good to know that this mirror can be reversed to fit on the passenger side by the following procedure (dictated by a CIPA representative):Place the mirror between your kneesTwist the stem (very hard)180 degreesNo tools necessary.I bought two, returned one becuase I could not figure out how to reverse it; then I contacted CIPA and got the information."
2,Does Not Keep Accurate Time,"I should have thrown this Sunbeam timer out long ago. It has never accurately timed--seems like it is a few minutes off from whatever time is set. Knowing that and being a cheapskate, I have compensated while using it. But you shouldn't have to--just buy a different and more reliable timer!"
1,Terrible,Don't waste your time or money.It is very cheap with no backing (see attached pictures above).It does not work with under 10 minutes. The ringer buzzes when it is at the 2 or 3 mark. I use this for a timer so my kids now their time-outs are timed fairly. And it doesn't work.The buzz is very quiet too unless you are in the same room.Save the $11 bucks and waiting for a package. Get it elsewhere.
5,Perfect Relaxation,This is a wonderful blend of relaxation and meditation music. We often play this CD in the background as we gather for our weekly meditation / prayer group study.
1,fail,"this perfume is strong, offensive, the type that will give you a headache. there are no hints of captivating notes. there is no allure, nothing mysterious or beautiful. it smells like a concoction of random toxic chemicals direct from a test tube. it is the kind of perfume someone with no taste slaps on just for the sake of wearing a perfume. then for the rest of the day everyone within a 15 foot vicinity suffers."
5,Memorable and Finely Crafted,"You are in for a real treat listening to each cut of TWO TREES . The production value is sublime, crafted by two professional musicians- Mitran and Jewer- comfortable enough in their own music forms to collaborate and produce a solid listening album. Creating mood, imagery, story through musiceach unique collaboration with each guest musician leaves a deep imprint in your consciouness. Native American and traditional instruments are easily forged in original works which simmer inside your heart. Thanks for sharing your musical feast with us."
5,DRAGON LEE IS THE GREATEST!!!!,The north Korean superstar Dragon Lee is back and shock fans with his amazing fight choreography and stunning screen presence. Dragon Lee is the greatest kung fu movie star!
3,Not a children's movie,"We rec'd this film as a birthday gift for our child. A note to other parents: This is not a children's movie. There are multiple mentions of sexual orgasms, brief nudity and other crass humor. As an adult, the movie is worth watching but not great. I appreciated the Don Quixote impossible dream aspect. There are some wonderful lines in the movie about not living an ordinary life."
2,"ok, i think i missed something.","what kind of movie is this? i put the VHS into my machine, expecting a swashbuckling adventure, and i get this! instead of swashbuckling action, i get some 5-year old fantasy about some wacko and his silly sidekicks. and worst of all, one of the leading characters is a little girl, not a day older than 8. and her reaction when the baron wants to quit is so stereotypical and contrived. ""you CAHNT quit!"" ""i don't like you anymore""! how Disneyish! instead of a dashing hero swordfighting with 20 bad guys, i got a weirdo who runs 150 miles an hour. instead of thrills, excitement and humor, i got an old man travelling to the moon ina hot air balloon(come on!) and meeting people with detatchable heads, and some white faced dude screaming ""I am your elephant of joy!"" oh for Pete's sakes! there are some OK scenes near the end, but it's not worth your time or money, and you should just go rent Mask Of Zorro again instead."
4,Subpar Blu Ray of film that deserves better.,"There are few films as rich in detail and design as this, so it's sad that the Blu ray is only a shade better than the DVD. But it's cheap, so, it's worth it."
4,Fantastical fun for all ages,"This movie is a wonderful adventure which never takes itself seriously, and you shouldn't either. With excellent performances, fantastical sets and storyline, and a leading man who never gives up, it is a light-hearted romp with incredible imagination with a surprise around every corner. Thrill, intrigue, romance, death and war all play a part. My only complaint is that it is quite long. I am overjoyed to own it!"
4,Eric Idle rules the day...and the Baron too,"This movie, though it has its dark moments, has the wit of Terry Gilliam as its director, and Eric Idle is great as always"
2,Heartfelt but killed by its own extravagance,"God love Terry Gilliam: a brilliant moviemaker and animator whose heart is always in the right place. Terry intended this as a homage/tribute to the brilliant Czech animator Karel Zeman, whose earlier version of the Munchausen fable is still the definitive one. This version, though well-meant, is done in by too much budget and too many 'Spot-The-Star' moments. Anybody looking to really exercise that 'sense-of-wonder' should hunt down Zeman's version: despite its poor characterizations, mainly post-synch sound and general narrative torpor, it's truly unforgettable and the reason Gilliam became an animator in the first place. Though Gilliam's 'Baron' is clever and generally watchable, it too suffers from narrative torpor - which is harder to excuse with a $40- million budget."
3,The Adventures of Baron Munchausen 20th Anniversary Edition,"This is an entertaining, though silly movie. Robbin Williams is wonderful in it and it is worth buying just to see his role in it. The main actor that plays the Baron does a wonderful job. It is an ok movie if you have some down time."
2,Not that great,"I was expecting this to be really good after all the rave reviews; and no, it wasn't terrible; but it's not that great. It's way to weird and not very funny. This is definitely a fantasy movie, but I really didn't sense any magic in it. I thought that Labyrinth was a much better movie. If you're a big Terry Gilliam fan, you might want to get this. I personally like 12 monkeys and Time Bandits way more than this."
5,"definately no ""casual"" viewers",This film is very entertaining and intense. If you are willing to commit it can envelope you into a fabulous fantasy world of beauty and wonder. It is as tantalizing and curious as Fantasia and The Neverending Story. And the effects are excellent!
5,Un gran cuento ...,"como aquellos que nos contaban de niño, pero para entenderlo como adulto. Una historia genial para mayores, aunque no muy entretenidas para niños del 2000."
4,Faith and belief triumphs.,"A wonderful tale of tremendous deeds and exotic locales. Gilliam portrays the infamous yarn-spinner Munchausen gloriously, forcing the viewer to be swept away by the film's wit and visual splendor. A true masterpiece for those who know that faith and belief will always triumph over science and pragmatism. The film's presentation on DVD gives Gilliam his due."
4,A good time funny movie for all ages,"This is a good time, funny movie with an all star cast. Sometimes a bit hard to follow the Barons wild web he weaves. Well worth the watch no matter your age."
4,Another Winner From The Brilliant Terry Gilliam,"Although this film falls slightly short of the artistic triumphs Gilliam achieved with ""Brazil"" and ""The Fisher King,"" it's still an amazing spectacle. An imaginative, whimsical tale that will please adults and children alike, and a must-see for fans of Gilliam and/or Python."
4,Chapter 8 of this book is outstanding!,"You will find in this book what you usually find in similar titles: basic circuit analysis, first and second order circuits, phasor analysis, Fourier series and transforms, Laplace transforms, and the like. What makes this book different is the treatment the author gives to operational amplifiers. In particular chapters 8 and 9 are going to be very useful if you are into sintetizing transfer functions you can easyly implement."
3,Get one of the better booklets,"I adore Nordic Needle and go to its annual stitch-in. I've met Roz Watnemo and can attest she's one of the loveliest, most savvy ladies in needlework you'd ever want to meet. I have dozens of NN's booklets, particularly the Award-Winning Hardanger books, and have done many such projects. However, unless you want to have a piece with ""uffda"" on it...there are much better out there. And I'm even Norwegian."
4,A must read book for Great Tactics!!,"Combination Challenge is the best book I have ever seen for studying chess tactics. I like the way the book is formatted and I use the study method described in the book. I see more tactics and win more games than I used to. I try to work on the problems every day just like the book recommends. I haven't done all of the diagrams yet, but I plan to keep going until I have finished the book. Then I plan to do it again! This is a fun and inexpensive way to learn chess."
1,Save Your Money,"More than 900 of this book's 1100+ problems appear in Reinfeld's ""One Thousand and One Winning Sacrifices and Combinations,"" also available from Amazon.com. That book is available for approximately half the price of ""Combination Challenge,"" so unless you absolutely cannot handle descriptive notation, buy the original."
4,Very Large Number of Tactical Problems to Solve,"This is a very thick book with a large number of tactical problems. Personally I like to learn tactics by seeing how a tactical situation is reached, and therefore prefer opening Trap books such as, ""101 Opening Chess Traps"" or even better yet ""Winning Chess Traps for Juniors"", or complete games containing tactical themes. However, a book with just point blank problems to solve has its use and this book gives you a lot of bang for your buck.It is true about what the other reviewers have pointed out that ""Combination Challenge"" has most of the same positions you find in Reinfeld's two books, and even along with the mistakes in some of the answers! Whereas, chess positions and games are not copyrightable, exact copying from another book is. ""Combination Challenge"" falls short of that infringement.If lots of tactical problems is what you are looking for, you have found it!"
5,very inspiring,"Songs of inspiration is great for playing in the car, and singing along. Really inspires, makes you feel good"
5,What a beautiful way to learn decorative painting!,"Priscilla has done a wonderful job with this book! It is very informative, with step by step instructions for each brush stroke technique as well as gorgeous photos of each phase of the design. All that you have to do is follow her detailed directions, and practice, and you too can turn out stunning artwork! Everything you need to know is included in this book! It's just fun to page through and look at, as she is a very talented artist!"
4,Good,I was able to learn a lot and come up w/ some additional designs based off of some of the pictures and instructions.
4,spiritual journey,"I love the way the music flows. Taking you from Spanish to African to native American to the middle East, and gothic European melodies and vocals. Its an great CD"
1,This review is for the edition not the story....,"I opened up this book last night and had to almost immediately put it down. The number of errors on just pages 1 and 2 alone were so many that I could not read this book. I don't want to spend 312 pages trying to figure out that ""parity"" should be instead ""purity."" There is a poem at the start of the story which is four lines long and in this edition, the word ""Ljutdox"" ends the poem. I pulled up the book online from a free site and it should have read ""Landon."" On page 2, the word given is ""Bo"" when it should be ""so."" I am returning my copy this week."
5,This book is wonderful!,"Love how the writer entwined the grace, beauty and mercy of God throughout the whole of the book. Bursting with joy in the midst of sorrow."
1,an condensed edition,"I have a copy of the book printed in 1854 which has 523 pages. This book is a condensed version of 96 pages. If I had been aware of that fact, I would not have bought it."
1,The Lamplighter,"I love the story of The Lamplighter, but this paperback version of The Lamplighter, published by General Books LLC is full of mistakes! I own an original version of The Lamplighter. This gives me an accurate reference. The paperback is full of typographical errors. The first two pages have 8 errors. Also, the story does not flow properly. For example, in order to follow the story as it was written on page 18, you must turn to page 26 to continue the story! I had planned to give this as a gift, but now am going to get a refund. I am very disappointed."
3,poor reproduction,"Although the book is the same words as one I got from a friend, it is a poor reproduction with vague type face and large format. OK but not what I expected."
1,Well.,They are very cheap (in all aspects) I only bought them for a night out. And that was all they lasted. I even bought them a size bigger than what I normally wear. The moment I put them on they ripped at the toes. Then when I went to a Fund Raiser they snagged on a chair (that wasn't even sharp or anything) and they were completely destroyed.
3,"Aspirations of Glory, Technical Frustrations","This could be a great game if it were not for the technical problems. It does have all the elements of a grand strategy game-battle, intrigue, commerce, diplomacy, random events,etc. The screenshots are very realistic. The interface is not hard to learn. And so on, and so on.... It really could be fun if you could play it. There are several technical problems that occur, from installation on. Check out the website at AntikGames for the forum to see. The developers are fumbling around now with a patch to solve the problems, but....shouldn't the game be brought to market ready to play and enjoy? This game was so hyped and anticipated among those who like Roman themed games. They should refund everybody's money."
1,IT DOESN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN THIS,"This is the worst game ""out of the box"" I've ever played, more bugs than you can shake a stick at, crashes to desktop, no real useful or helpful tutorial or manual. You'll be pulling your hair out within five minutes of installation. This is yet another one of those ""BUY IT NOW, WE'LL FIX IT LATER"" games out of the box, EXCEPT this time, there's NO FIX for it, it's been almost two months and no patch fix that will make the game run correctly and fix the bugs and flaws is available yet and now some idiot moderator is just banning anyone that says anything bad about the game on the official forum. My suggestion stay away from this one completely. It's worse than SUK but I can't say that word here. ;)"
1,Got Roman Fun? Not this game,To all Roman History gamers :Stay away from this turkey unless you want to pick up a real swordand go postal.
2,Lots of weirdness and things unexplained,"Herzog and Lynch team up for this very strange story of a troubled man who spends time in Peru and comes back different--though this is never really explained. The guy is the lead in a Greek play and ends up wanting to kill just as his character does, except he does it for real. Much time is spent with the police talking to the play's director and the man's fiancee to try to understand why he did it.Oh, and there are lots of flamingoes. And ostriches. And a basketball.Odd, and has an interesting and offbeat soundtrack, but I don't really think I would recommend it overall."
1,"Unique, mystifying - hogwash!","I suppose if you're into the auteur theory used by the directors of the nouvelle vague, under the influence of magic mushrooms, just intensely fascinated by pink flamingos, or just plain pretentious you will fun this film hypnotizing <snort> or darkly humorous. I call it forgettable...what was the title again?"
4,"Worth buying the DVD for ""Plastic Bag""...","I ws somewhat underwhelmed by ""My Son, My Son..."" I've liked most of Herzog's films much better. It held my interest, but I didn't find it very satisfying. Quirky yet predictable, and I thought the acting was spotty. What clinches this as a must-buy, however, is the short film, ""Plastic Bag,"" narrated by Herzog and directed by Ramin Bahrani. I'd never heard of the film nor seen any of Bahrani's other films, but this is the most brilliant 18 minutes of filmmaking I've probably ever seen. Compelling, charming, poetic, funny, tragic, and touching, and it does it all without any digital effects. I won't say more so as not to spoil it, but while I'll probably never watch ""My Son..."" again, I'll be returning to ""Plastic Bag"" and sharing it with friends for a long time to come..."
4,Herzog does Lynch,"Herzog makes a Lynch film and the hybrid is bizarre. Not one of Herzog's finest films but still offers images unseen. Ostriches, flamingoes, guerilla filmmaking, and a midget. Utter madness."
2,"Werner Herzog, What Have You Done?","After Herzog's brillant ""Bad Lieutenant-Port of Call New Orleans"", I watched this filmwith certain amount of expectation.It was a complete disappointment.The conclusion I had was Werner Herzog is only human.I will wait for his next one."
5,A Must Have For Anyone Interested In NJ,"As a lifelong resident of the Garden State I thought I knew pretty much everything important about New Jersey. After I took a look at this book I saw I didn't know anything. Every section in ""Skudera's Ultimate Guide to NJ"" is greatly detailed with each destination's history and any info needed(i.e. address, hours of operation, and ticket price) for visitor's of the attraction. The CD that accompanies the book is even better! It contais an easy database to use where you can look up just about all the information that is in the book, I believe it might even contain more than the book. Plus the picures contained on the CD are great. There are so many destinations to read about in both the book and the CD, I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to get through them all. I recomend this book for every New Jersey resident, and with the gift giving season coming up I think it would be a great item for someone who has moved away and misses the Garden State!"
4,These are great speakers,Great sound but after awhile you begin to notice them when you don't want to notice them. Maybe that is why they are discounting these.
4,"If the Navy was perfect, this would be one of its Bibles.","Excellent book that fills in a lot of gaps that the Naval Instructions leave out (especially if you are applying to OCS). I would have rated it 5 stars, except for one glaring omission: The book fails to mention how much of an uphill administrative battle applying for OCS is (just TRY dealing with your Command Career Counselor on this). I turned my package in 3 months ago, and it STILL hasn't left my command yet. One of the problems with the process is that the Navy's instructions on how to apply for some of the programs are very, very vague. Also, all 3 of the CCC's I've had at my present command had absolutely no idea on how to help me, because they all had little experience in dealing with officer programs. My advice is to find a personable officer in your command (preferably an Ensign who has just been commissioned through your program of interest), ask for their advice, and follow the letter formats given in the book VERBATIM!"
5,An awesome book if you are considering the Navy.,This book is an indispensable resource if you are even thinking about joining the Navy. It tells numerous common fallacies and gives thousands of helpful suggestions to use towards getting a commission. It walks you through every step of the process! I found it very reassuring and extremely invaluable.
2,Not enough info,"I read the book and it was informative, but i don't think it was in-depth enough. It didn't tell you exact steps that need to be taken to begin an officer career. Also, after i read the book, I did some more research contacting the navy directly and they gave me some straight facts that really made me re-evaluate if this is what i want to do. i felt like the book tried to sell the navy too much, rather than tell it like it is."
1,Good--If you have no access to the internet!,"I was looking forward to reading this book because I thought it would offer some great insights into becoming an Naval officer. I was sorely disapointed. There was nothing in this book that I could not get from looking on the internet for 5 minutes. I could not believe that any book professing to tell about the Navy could be so devoid of details on job descriptions, service reqirements, specifics on what makes a person a competitive candidate. I was hoping for insights from a veteran recruiter. I ended up with an extended brochure that I read long ago on the internet. Don't waste your money."
1,Waste of Money!,"I purchased this mirror for my fiance for Christmas. I was embaressed when he took it out of the box! It's poorly made, the mirror looks warped no matter which way you turn it, the shelf is too flimsy to hold anything... As if that's not bad enough, the first time he used it, it completely fogged up! This was a complete and total watse of $54.00. I wouldn't recommend this mirror to anyone."
1,Mediocre mirror with a terrible warranty.,"First the mirror:* It fogs...maybe not at first, but eventually it will fog up regularly.* The suction cups don't work for long....most nights I'll awaken to the sound of it falling in the shower at 5am.* It looks like it's metal, but it's plastic.Now for the company...The warranty is pathetic...Zadro warrants all their products for only 90 days! And you have to pay $5 to have the product fixed under warranty. (In addition to paying shipping...but most companies require that).How can a company not stand behind its products for more than 90 days? And why would you want to do business with such a company?"
4,Well-written Poems,"Dings isn't a showman; he is the authentic thing. His poems aren't flashy, but they are real, filled with real things and people. An impressive book of poems."
3,Get it at Home Depot!,"Get real, people! You can buy this real Briggs & Stratton oil filter at Home Depot for $9 and you don't have to pay shipping. They're not hard to come by."
1,Want a soap pump that pumps soap.. too bad if you buy this one,I guess this one won't be for you. It can barely pump water. And it wasn't just defective. I bought 2 and BOTH of them didn't work! Horrible.
1,terrible quality control,"The stainless soap container is a great shape and feels well-made. The dispenser pump did not screw onto the soap container at all. The size was right, but the grooves did not match at all, and the pump would not attach securely to the container. (And, by the way, the pump didn't work.) This may have been the worst item I've ever purchased from Amazon. I returned it promptly."
4,"Good, functional tooth brush holder","This is a good, functional tooth brush holder -- not fancy but it serves its purpose well and looks good in the bathroom. I like that the top comes off easily and I can put it in the dishwasher. That's handy. BTW, I haven't noticed any problems with rust (yet). I have had mine for three years now."
1,Didn't work,"This thing never worked out of the box.. not worth trying to RMA it for the low cost of it, but dont recommend it."
