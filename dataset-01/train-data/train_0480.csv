3,"Cool Visuals, Not Much Else","Sky Captain was really a disapointing movie, the visuals were cool, the demurred color scheme, the captured streamlined look of the 1930's was superbly captured, and Gweneth P. was particularly hot in this movie, but that was about it. I lack the ability to see airplanes that double as submarines, and ray guns that fire metal melting smoke rings. Nothing special about this movie other than its ability to be overly disapointing."
2,review,"""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"", is a futuristic 1930's movie serial drama type of genre. This movie reminded me of an old colorized classic like ""The Maltese Falcon"" but not as good. A sort of Flash Gordon meets Star Wars kind of film. The ""hero"" of the move is a piolit of a flying tiger air craft that can go for ever on a tank of gas and if in trouble; can dive into the ocean at a great speed with out falling apart. It then has the ability to become an under water mode of transportation. The heroin she's the 1990's women's liberated Lois Lane news reporter type, who is out for the next big news paper, hold the presses, stop everything scoop of her life. Campy at times and cute, this movie falls a little short of being a classic by any stretch of the imagination. But then again, I think, that was what the movies intent was all along. One wouldn't miss much if they missed this film but it is good wholesome family entertainment. 2 stars."
3,Innovative and stylish but flawed,"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a wonderful, nostalgic romp through old movie serials. And it probably heralds a new paradyme in movie-making, making it well worth a look.But Sky Captain is not worth more than a look. It lacks much of the warmth, humor, and plot twists that made Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark so delightful. It concentrates too much on art and not enough on making the viewer care about the characters and about their various predicaments. As a result, the action sequences seem a bit cold and rote, as if they were included just because it they were expected to be there.In the end, Sky Captain remains a remarkable effort. And I eagerly await its makers' next movie. But as it is, Sky Captain is best seen as an example of what is to come and as yet another reminder that dazzling technology is not enough; a movie also needs a good plot, realistic humor, and characters that we can care about if it is to become a classic in its own right."
5,one of the best,all these reviews suck ok i loved this movie a reason wy all these reviews are bad is because adults dont get kids movies this is not for an A-dult it is simply for kids and teens i loved this movie and you will to so buy it you will like it trust me after all i am a KID not an ADULT its the right decision to buy itPS I LOVE THIS MOVIE
2,Virtual Acting,"Ok, the graphics were kool and very retro which is why I got the DVD in the first place. But come on, the acting was like - well the actors sent in their virtual representations. Maybe blue screen acting is just to hard for some people. The acting from this movie reminded me of acting scenes from a rather famous video game series that another movie flop was later made from. I did appreciate the graphics and all the efforts that went into making those from the geek part of my brain. But there was just no human interest to the actors' parts. The extras disc was probably more interesting than the actual movie when it comes right down to it."
3,Angelina Jolie in Black Leather.,"I fell in lust with Jolie when in my early 20's when I saw Hackers, when she was still a teen. Well, she's all grown up now and I'm still a sucker for those eyes. The movie is visually interesting, but really my only interest was seeing her in leather. I was hoping she would be kidnapped and tied and maybe tormented a bit by the Asian femme fetale android. But alas, that does not happen. Even though she cornily attempts an English accent, Angela still has those deliciously gorgeous eyes. Yeah I got a Jolie fetish. Paltrow by the way ain't too bad either, but even though Jolie's scene is brief, she lights up the screen."
3,"good,but it had flaws","The movie was okay,but when I first saw the trailer I was blown away.But I noticed the scenes in the movie were far different than that of the trailer.The storyline about the Mystery Woman confused me.The special effects were good,but the storyline need some work.However I would compare the movie to a 1930's version of Star Wars,but as I had just mentioned,the storyline needs some work."
4,Fun,"A throwback to the days of movie house serial and cliffhangers, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is just plain fun. Wonderfully visualized in an ""All Green Screen alternate world of giant flying robots, WWII era fighter planes that drive into the sea to become submarines, flying aircraft carriers, near super heroes (and heroines) and evil geniuses... It makes you wish it were true. Silly and beautiful to look at, the film never takes itself too seriously. Watch for a cameo by legendary (and deceased) Sir Laurence Olivier."
3,"Beautiful film, mediocre acting","Visual style of the film is gorgeous, and the digital effects are impressive. Literally jaw droppingly beautiful backdrops and production design at points. Probably looks amazing on Blu-Ray, and at $9.99, might even be worth picking up. Core issue with this film is that Jude Law lacks the edge of a Harrison Ford or Daniel Craig and comes across as more of a romantic hero than action hero. Gwyneth Paltrow is passable as is Giovanni Ribisi, but Angelina Jolie is pretty one dimensional. Plot is typical popcorn entertainment fare, but the pacing is pretty spot on and there are several terrific action sequences. Worth a watch."
1,Worst movie I've EVER seen,"I would have given this zero stars if possible. I saw it in the movie theater and my husband and I kept asking each other if we should leave. We didn't - hopeing beyond hope that maybe - just maybe it would get better once Jolie steppped forth - but NO!Then - we thought - surely the ending would be interesting. But no, dear God no. PLEASE don't watch this movie - much less buy it!"
4,Outstanding scenery,"This movie is worth seeing for the look alone! It is set in a hyper-stylized deco world, very retro-futuristic.There are very few suprises, plot wise, but not bad acting or script."
2,Cool Retro but looks too fake to take seriously.,Fine throwback to the serial movies of the 40's that is fine for what it is but lacks a script and a story to capture the feel of that era. Jude Law and Company are fine but they are the only things in this entire film that look real. The rest of the film looks a little too fake to be taken seriously and the CGI is a little too much for it's own sake.A good film to watch if nothing is on but not worth the ticket to see.
2,Kid Stuff,"After watching this movie, its more for the kids on saturday morning. The previews gave me the illusion that if was more geared toward an adult audience. So much for the previews."
1,If you liked this movie then you must be a Dork,"This is truly the most boring movie of 2004. The acting is extremely bad. All of the characters lacked any type of emotion. I still remember the last lines of this movie, ""Lens Caps"". Oh boy, I felt like shooting myself in the head."
2,Fly Captain! Fly! As fast as you can!,"Why does the 'world of tomorrow' look like 1930's Art-deco? You know? The past? Nice attempt to create the feel of old crappy Hollywood serials, but it felt like there were only 5 actors (and people) in the entire film and the purposefully bad dialogue and characterization was pretty annoying after five minutes. It might have worked better if it actually seemed like the actors were in the scene when they were filmed, instead of pasted in from shots made in a broom closet. If you want cool footage of dirigibles and flying robots, go see Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky. I'm pretty sure the director did.Actually, if the critical faculties are turned off, this really isn't a bad time waster, even if the sepia-tone makes things look out of focus instead of creating a sense of nostalgia."
3,"Extravagantly Derivative, Entertaining and Fun To Watch","This is a film that is set in an amorphous era highly suggestive of WWII, with subject matter and imagery (Robots) from 1930's to 1950s Sci Fi, and the look of a silent era film, most often ""Metropolis"". 1940's film quality and cinematography were much better than this, but it works, so who cares? The dialog is snappy and there's actually a rather involved story that caught me by surprise. All in all it was very entertaining even if some of it was patently unbelievable. Ah well. The mystery is how this didn't become a series, and it would be very nice for tv."
2,"Interesting, but...",Bold concept and visually dazzling... and... and... I ran out of positive things to say about this movie.
4,entertaining,"The movie did to me what it was supposed to do, entertain. i got turned off when i saw the first 5 min of the movie, but i gave it the benifit of the doubt, and it was worth watching, don't buy thought, its a one time see thing.i wish angelina jolie had a bigger role, i'm not a big fan or anything, it's just that, for some reaseon, i pay extra attention to her ever since i watched tomb raider I, i hated the 2nd. any way the movie is uniqley and different in a catoonish kind of reality......"
5,Looks Incredible!,"I recently saw a preview for Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, and it was one of the most amazing things that I have ever seen in my life! Jude Law stars in the film, along with Angelonie Jolie. The plot seems thin, but there are airplanes, birds, hot-air balloons, WWII fighters, futuristic weapons, and much more! The cinematography is what really caught my eye, with a dreamy, comic-book like fantastic world approach. The visuals are spot-on with incredible CGI and flight sequences that put Star Wars to shame. Comic book or aviation fanatics, this could be what you have been waiting for. With this movie being the one I have been most excited about since Big Fish, which was incredible, this looks like it will break Hollywood ground forever. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is about to land! Will it soar to glory or be shot down to another Hollywood misery? We'll have to wait and see!"
2,All that Glitters is Not Gold,"Some movies are dazzling in their originality and style, while others merely borrow from better films. Sadly, Sky Captain is the latter. While this film is luminously photographed, it doesn't contain one iota of originality in its threadbare script. Perhaps my sights were set to high, hoping for a loving tribute to films like Metropolis. But even if they were lower, I still might have balked to see a leather-uniformed, eye patch wearing Angelina Jolie giving orders to the ""amphibious squad"". Throughout this movie I was literally counting the films which it ripped off. I suppose they were somehow hoping if you put all the parts of successful movies together, you might end up with a winner yourself. Unfortunately all you end up with is a beautifully photographed mess."
1,"Slow, slower and slowest","This movie wasn't worth the $4 1st showing admission, not to mention the popcorn and candy price. It was slow, unimaginative and oh so booooring. The stone characters wandered around the contrived sets like mice in a maze looking for their million dollar pay checks at the end. There was no dialog to speak of, character development was a no show, and the story, well, it sure could have been a whole lot better. Don't waste your money."
2,Sky Captain and the world of Awful,"UGH, At times i thought i was watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Then at others the Wizard of Oz. The only enjoyable part was when Gwyneth took her last shot and i shouted ""how gay!"" If you must see this bring plenty of scratch off tickets cause you might as well feel lucky."
1,Another take,"A lot of people here seem to like this movie, I am not one of them. I got this as one of the five films you get via coupon for buying a HD DVD player, and at free it is not worth the price. The concept is great, but the plot is silly and disjointed, the acting sucks (yes I am talking about Gwyneth Paltrow in particular). It just left me flat. A concept that could have worked well turns out to be just a mess in execution. At least they tried something different."
1,Couldn't the robots have stepped on Polly in the opener?,"Whichever reviewer said Gwyneth Paltrow mailed in her worst acting on this one, had it nailed. I actually MADE myself watch to the point where Angelina Jolie came in, HOPING she would add some flavor to this bland movie. No good. I ended up turning it off and calling it a day before the thing even ended.On the positive side, I could only stomach ONE bad movie that weekend, so decided not to go see Constantine, just in case. Whew! Thanks Sky Captain for saving me from that one!!"
1,bad quality for a blu-ray,"all is in the title, very bad quality of the picture, may be the DVD is better"
1,Did not play in Xbox 360 player,This disk did not play in my 360 player. The replacement that was sent also was not read. Are there others that do not work in thr 360 player? Really disappointed because i would have enjoyed this film in HD.
1,Tomorrow Should Never Come!,"Good heavens was this movie awful! What in the world was the point to this unclever completely worthless waste of time! This movie was boring, the special effects were unimpressive, the characters were not interesting at all(especially the villains), the story was limp, Gwyneth Paltrow whom I usually love and have quite a crush on was acting like an annoying bratty little 12 year old always wanting her way, I got sick and tired of listening to Gwyneth and Jude Law's constant bickering, the character Dex was one dimensional, and sexy Angelina Jolie neither could save the movie nor does she look good as a tom-boyish type with an eye-patch! All in all a big waste of time and money! Anyway you want to see an awesome groundbreaking science fiction movie watch Battlefield Earth don't watch this garbage!"
1,What a disapointment. . .,"I was thrilled that a new retro-Sci fi movie had come out. Unfortunatley this movie did not meet up to my expectations. The entire movie is a gigantic illusion. The speciall effects are incredible but nothing except for the actors is real in this film. The entire movie is computer generated. If they were going to create the movie like this then they should have done a complete CGI like Beast Wars, Finding Nemo, or even Monster's INC.Having real actors in a movie that is made of so many special effects kind of hurts the head andthe eyes after a while. Needless to say I was very disapointed in this film.My question is thus:Was ""Taking Lives"" the reason Angelina Jolie stares in ""Sky Captain""?--Safe journeys:David"
4,HD-GEE!,"The first time I watched this movie I thought it had the potential to be one of the great all-time sci-fi movies. Of course the story line was interesting but the hook was the time period - 1940's - and so the lure of art-deco production values. It's the kind of film that was 'good' on the old CRT as a rental but blooms into a Blu-Ray 'very good' movie on a 50"" HD plasma . I call this the 'HD-GEE!' effect- hence the title of this review ( ahem ).Look, either you like this type of movie or you don't. The actors are two-dimensional like comic-book actors would be, the story is outrageous, the pretensions are ever present, the star doesn't get the girl, the bad guy is snuffed by father time, the rules of time and space and speed and mass are broken all over the place but that's okay- THE BLU-RAY IMAGE IS GREAT ON MY BIG HDTV!!!Does anything else really matter???"
3,Disappointing.,"The special effects are undeniably impressive. But it seems to me the movie is groundbreaking only in the sense that it uses MORE computer graphics than earlier films, not necessarily better ones. In other words, this movie could have dazzled everyone if it had been the first to use these techniques -- instead of just using a bigger quantity of them.So what's left is the acting and the story, and neither was exceptional. So I found myself fast-forwarding through parts of this film, and feeling un-impressed at the end of it."
3,Looked so good,"This film looks so beautiful. I just wish that I liked it more. Done almost entirely with blue screen, the actors really had their job cut out for them imagining all of the crazy things going on around them. If you have ever seen the old seriels of Flash Gordon, this is very much the style of the movie. Set in 1939, with strange future gadgets that seem a little silly now. Sort of like when you watch the old Star Trek series with the ship being operated by a lot of knobs and dials when we know now that it won't be that way whenever we acheive that ability. While Sky Captain is ambitious, it just falls flat for me and didn't rouse me into really caring for the characters and story. This one is worth renting once to see the beautiful effects. I would wait to purchase until after you have given it a watch."
3,A classic old time feel,"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is made in the manor of a clasic science pulp fiction novel. The movie is presented in a yellowish black and white format that gives it the feeling of a very old film. The story line is a clasic good guy vs the evil Nazi mad doctor. As such, the movie is best suited if you are looking for the ambiance."
3,An Fun Sci Fi Fantasy,"If you forgive the weak plot, it will be a fun movie to watch and eat buttered popcorn."
4,Watched this with my kids.....great movie!,"I bought this DVD for my boyfriend and I to watch. When I got it home, and saw that it was rated PG I figured it might be OK to let my two sons, ages 9 and 7, watch too.OK - I'll be honest - my seven-year-old was sound asleep within 15 minutes of the movie starting. But, my older son stayed totally into it though the end. The visual effects were terrific! I won't get into the plot - you can read that above. I thought it was a great movie with a satisfying ending. VERY unique in the way it looked!Two thumbs up! It's rare to find movies that are actually OK to watch with your kids, and this one is a winner!"
4,A Lofty Goal Achieved.,"Being born in the early 50's, I grew up with all the classic A and (sometimes better) B Sci-Fi movies i.e Earth vs The Flying Saucers. I also had and continue to have a wish that I could time travel back into the 30's and 40's to satisfy my intrigue of the imagery and life of those days that today are only black and white mementos in my parent's photo albums. That's why Sky Captain was a treat for me.Let me simply suggest that if you are a BOOMER as I, you stand a pretty good chance of really enjoying this film. Not to mention how the director's vision was achieved technologicaly. Impressive stuff! If nothing else, he should take pride in knowing that he accomplished what nobody else in Hollywood has done before."
2,Fly High,"If you love comic books of the 1930s and movies from the ""Film Noir""-era then Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a must see for you. It is like comic book characters fly off the page at you. It is much like the Flash Gordon flicks of long ago with some snazzy not so special-special effects. What little plot there is comes largely plagiarized out of 1930's science fiction scripts. If you believe that comic books are in-depth reading for you, then the plot and dialogue will be just fine. No matter how much glitter you put on scat...it is still scat. 90+ minutes of my life down the drain."
2,Jude Law = no chemistry,"As in Cold Mountain, Jude Law's lack of chemistry with his leading ladies let the air out of this movie. Combined with a weak plot it left the film slide along as a chain of stunning set pieces without emotional involvement.Jolie's short bit showed how the challenge could have been met, I wish she had played the lead."
4,FUTURISMO!,"I greatly enjoyed this! It was like watching an action packed 1940s adventure/Sci-fi comic book come to life! The pacing, the story, the acting, the feel and look all nailed down that whole 30s/40s art deco/streamlined futuristic experience. If you have a huge screen and a home theater system this is worth a buy.The special features were enjoyable too. Just because it was nice to see how this unknown guy and his brother from nowhere was able to make this dream and vision come to life in a big way."
2,Good picture bad movie,The sound and picture are very good. It's a bit fuzzy where it should but but it's clearly done appropriately. Some of the snow scenes look absolutely beautiful. The movie itself well....sucks.
3,"Great movie, #$%@$ irritating DVD","While I adore this movie and its stylish 1939 look and feel, I can't help being profoundly angry that the DVD forces you to watch no less than four previews for other movies before you're allowed to get to the menu to start the film. It disables the ""menu"" button so you can't skip past them. I paid for the DVD, why should I be forced to watch advertising every time I want to see the movie?"
2,so that's why it flopped!,"I was so amazed when I heard this movie flopped. I expected it to be a huge blockbuster, and there was so much buzz about it on the internet. Then I finally got the dvd and watched it myself, and all that failure is explained - yeah, a boring story. The special effects are interesting, but only for a little while. Boring story, boring characters, boring ending. Just blah. The script needed some serious doctoring."
4,Worthy of Special Consideration,"Congratulations should go out to the Director, Producer, cast and crew of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow...In the genre of Sci-Fi/Fantasy there exists a pantheon of films that are so bold, stunning, and visionary they seem to defy immitation even though they inspire great envy. Despite any possible deficits, I believe Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow will join the ranks of Bladerunner, The Dark Crystal, Tron, and 2001:a Space Odyssey (as well as a few others). I can think of no higher praise."
3,Really dark movie,"I do not mean ""dark"" in a metaphorical sense... The image itself is quite dark. I've tried to calibrate my projector to watch this movie, but it just does not look good... Someone really exaggerated with the image post-processing here, or perhaps the DVD was poorly mastered. However, it does fill completely my 16:9 which is really nice (unlike most movies that show black bars even in 16:9 sets), and the movie itself is not that bad, it's just... very 30's, and a little bit too ""photoshopped"". =)."
1,Will not play in XBox 360 HD DVD player,"I tried this HD DVD in 2 different 360 players as well as the replacement Amazon sent, both did not work in either 360 player. Avoid this one if you have the 360 player."
2,Beware of this DVD,"I started it 15 minutes ago and it contains an *unskippable* preview section at the front. Don't buy DVDs like this. At this point, I'm sure the movie wont be good enough to merit the pain of watching these terrible previews."
1,Stay Away From Sky Captain.....,"How can this movie go wrong? Great Cast and great look...well I saw this movie in theathers and I must say it was the biggest dissapointment EVER. Story is very dry and the all star cast are put to shame by cheesy one liners and a scribt that takes way to long to get into the plot of the movie. I wanted so bad to walk out of the theather, but I waited and hoped that things would get better. But all the cool parts that are seen in the trailer are shown in the first 15 minutes and the story completely changes gears in the third act of the scribt. I am beggin you to save your $20 and purchase a movie that you will enjoy instead of being dissapointed with SKy Captain"
2,Jude Blaw...,"I guess the main appeal of this movie is the way it is filmed. It has that old 60s classic look and feel. Like those old TV series with the tin foil robots. I suppose that's meant for nostalgic effect but probably not a compelling reason to go see a movie. I mean, if you have color, USE color! In the end, it just made me feel kind of dizzy.The CGI graphics are 2nd rate and the story is not very interesting. Maybe it would've been better if we got to see a Totenkopf. This movie is pretty short so not great value for your money although I'm not sure it would've been a good thing to make it any longer. Escepecially when I'm not particularly a fan of Jude Law nor Gwyneth Paltrow.Having said that, the movie does have its moments and I do like Angelina Jolie, although I'm not sure why you would cover half her face with an eyepatch. Overall, still an okay movie to watch."
2,Watch it with the sound off.,"A terrible screenplay. The story was juvenile, literally as if it was written by a 12 year old... a 12 year old in 1940, that is.There is NO character development at all. None. Zero. Zip. Goose eggs.The acting was juvenile. A shame, really, because I like Jude Law. Oh well.BUT! The visuals were interesting. An old sci-fi, film noir, movie serial vibe that was taken to the max. So much so that it can become distracting, but the idea was original, and so I give it two stars.Interesting eye-candy, but everything else was so terrible that it is almost shocking."
1,Amazon needs turkey rating ( 0 stars),"People who suggest parallels to 1930s Sci-Fi are FAR too easily convinced by ""retro"" trends. Citing gauzed, halo-like imaging as some wondrous approach is like falling for the horribly widespread ploy that Thomas Kinkade is a great artist. Tricks and gimmicks, that's Sky Captain.Only the visual effects have any bonafide relation to films of the 1930s, the worthwhile films anyway. This film is infinitely distant from films like Metropolis. This film is for dorks who excuse a film's flaws for the sake of the fact that it's particular to their interests. If this film had portrayed a murder mystery, for example, these Sci-fi nerds wouldn't be nearly as impressed as they are about this film.Zero stars, a TURDKEY"
1,ripping the past,"The title sequence where the robots invade the town directly rips the old max fliescher super man cartoon mechanical menace. Right down to camera angles, robot design, everything. And never is there a mention as him or the cartoon as a inspiration. Polly perkins is even a reporter like Lois lane. And the last comic ripp off I found was the Frankie character, who just like Marvel's Nick Furry, has an eye patch and comands a flying base in the clouds. And once again there is no mention of the comic or character as in inspiration. The mysterious woman character reminded me all too much of Darth Maul from starwars. And while the technology was a step forward all the charcters were a step backwards, with no credit to the origionals. Not origional enough for me."
1,A little washed out,"That's the only way I can describe it; both the imagery and the actors seem to have been painted in watercolors, only with too much water and not enough color. As many predicted, the mostly-virtual sets don't provide much inspiration for the actors to, y'know *act*. Instead, the film sort of lurches from one improbable premise to another, with little or no basis in plot or anything resembling logic.Overall, I haven't seen such a waste of time & money (not to mention pathetic acting) since the ""Dune"" remake. Near the end of the movie, our hero is fighting an evil cyborg, and gasps ""Why won't you die?"" By that point, I was rooting for the cyborg. 'Nuff said."
4,Sky Captain,"This is such a fun movie. After watching the movie and then the special features on how the movie was made, my appreciation of the movie increased. The dialog is sassy and fun. I thought it was great. A cross between Indiana Jones and Flash Gordon. Great job!"
3,Sky Captain......,"Good special effects, a little hard to get into. I'll watch it again before I finalize an opinion."
2,A missed opportunity,"Interesting movie... the graphic backgrounds are brilliant in a 1930's serial throwback kind of way, especially in the first 20 minutes, and it's worth seeing just for that, but the script is truly dismal, Jude Law is too bland to carry a movie of this type, and don't get me started on what I think of Angeline Jolie's ""acting""."
2,"Oh, I assure you; It's a gimmick","All right, so, I, a gay fella, fit only one gay stereotype perfectly - I adore art deco, Norman Bel Geddes, and modernist architecture/design. This also means I love the 1920s and 1930s. So, the look of this film is spot-on perfect for me and my aesthetic sense. The characters could have done been more effective if they weren't so close to being like characters from an earlier era of film. They were basically cardboard cutouts of film archetypes. None of them, except for Giovanni Ribisi's ""Dex"", are likable and the adventure aspect was difficult to enjoy because I didn't give a damn about anyone involved - - except for Dex. After realizing and saying all this, though, I'm quite likely to watch the film multiple times because of how much I love the look and feel of it."
3,It's in black and white but it's enjoyable movie.,"When I watched it in the theatre, it's in black and white but it's enjoyable movie. The plot is interesting. There are some suspenseful moments. The acting is engaging.It's absolutely worth watching."
4,Sorely underrated...,and with a cast this big I would have thought the studios would have marketed this movie better. I loved the style .. kinda like Sin City but not as graphic.
4,Underrated,"I personally enjoyed the 40s camp style of this movie. I thought the story was good, the acting appropriate for what was trying to be captured. The special effects were good, but not over dobe adding to the flavor of its intent to be a story from the past."
4,Entertaining Retro Future,I'm always drawn to old movies and books about yesteryear's view of what the future may look like. Sky Captain was unique since it was a modern take on a fictional 30's futuristic environment. Visually cool and unique since all the background was computer generated. But also for that reason it was a bit dark. The Blu-ray version helped make things a little sharper that were previously lost in shadowy vagueness. Its a keeper.
2,Great Visuals Boring Movie,This movie had great visuals but the storyline and actors were boring and made it difficult to stay awake. A great feature film for a yawning festival.
3,Expected a lot More,"Based on the hype, I was expecting something bigger than the Indiana Jones movies. What this film lacked, was a character as dynamic as Indiana Jones and a plausible storyline. Also, it appeared that this movie was filmed in black and white and then colorized (to give it an old movie feel). I think it might have been better if they just stuck to black and white (I hate the look of colorized movies).There were a lot of good special effects, such as when Gwyenneth Paltrow is manuvering through skyscrapper sized mechanical men and some comic relief that you had to be quick to catch (there is an image of Godzilla attacking Tokyo). Angelina Jolie is the highlight of the movie, giving a fine performance as a very proper British commander of an armada of flying aircraft carriers (if that makes sense). I think a sequel with her character as the star would work a lot better."
2,waste of a good cast and special effects,"As a lover of good science fiction, my advice would be to pass this one by...........unless you're under the age of 12. First, the good. The special effects are fantastic and the acting is top notch, as would be expected from the top drawer cast.The plot is disjointed and non-sensical. At times it gave me the sense that they were making it up as they went along. In order to compensate for the lack of a plot or any meaningful dialogue among the actors, the movie is absolute non-stop, balls out action.The movie is as frenetic as it is vapid - at least it is for adults.All that said, I probably would have loved this when I was about 8 or 9 years old. At its heart, it's a children's movie."
4,good,I thought this movie was ok. Jude Law was great of course - I wasn't overly keen on the storyline but it is what it is. Gywneth plays a Journalist and Angelina Jolie a sky pilot who leads a squadron against an evil mastermind etc.It's marvel comics genre but outside the box. Kind of a spin off.Good acting and the whole thing was done greenscreen which blew me away. Really brilliant for what it is - but not really a girls movie I think.
4,sky captain,I enjoyed Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow very much. It's much better on the big screen and the special effects and colorization made me think of the forties and fifties movies. Always exciting throughout.
4,Pretty Good After All!!,"I sat down to this movie,expecting the worst...bad script, terrible matching between the actors involved, a story that made zero sense....not the case at all!! Fun romp of action, intrigue, and just plain great!! I was riveted by this film and had to know what was going to happen next!!Great effects, style...everything all rolled into one!!Great for the kids to watch too!!"
2,All pretty pictures and no substance,"Any fan of golden age science fiction will appreciate the concept of this movie. An evil genius, big machines with rivets, robots, a quirky sidekick and a romantic interest make this a cookie cutter plot of the H.G. Wells era of science fiction. Visually, this movie is spectacular and it has brought life to classic fantasies of how the future world looked like to the people of the industrial revolution.Unfortunately the movie falls flat in execution. The actors, normally dependable, are detached and disinterested in the world around them. I would describe the performances as ""lazy."" It was as if Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and (Male Lead) were stuck on a boring carnival ride and couldn't wait for the ending so they could go home.This movie might be an important milestone in cinematic technology. It was the first (insert research here). However, it is simply impossible to ignore the weak plot and sleepy acting. This movie is a definite skip."
3,An interesting oddity,"""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" is a movie that will be better appreciated in the future than it is today. Its advanced technology was lost on today's audience, which could not comprehend it. It's a technophiles dream. It's also an ode to almost every action flick Hollywood has ever made.I could say a lot more, but I want you to actually SEE this movie and decide for yourself,"
3,The World of Tomorrow? Not What You Would Expect,"Beyond the obvious homage to the pulp sci-fi of the Fifties Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow offers a fresh spin on the old mad-scientist-takes-over-the-world-scenario. With its 21st Century special effects - used in a sort-of sepia tone throwback to the monster movie two reelers, Sky Captain will dazzle you with some truly nifty visuals. However, what's missing here is character development and a coherent editing of the action sequences. The stars certainly can chew digitized scenery as well as, well... the digitized characters, but even their make pretend expertise leaves the viewer incredulous. Miss Paltrow especially, looks rather bored and uninvolved, perhaps too much time in the green screen studio instead discussing character nuances and subtext with her director. Here's a movie that really defines ""high concept"" it's too bad that alternate-past conceptualization took precedence over present day story development."
3,OLIVIER'S GHOST,"My first question: why in the world did the producers and directors of this film decide to use the ""ghost"" of the great Sir Laurence Olivier in this movie? It doesn't seem at all necessary and its cleverness merely elicits a scratch of the head from this reviewer. Oh, well, guess they thought it would be ""original?""Anyway, this film, a digital masterpiece, is a wonderful homage to the films of the 30s 40s and 50s, gorgeously colored and with awesome digital effects. It is most definitely an eye candy movie, its acting and plot overshadowed by the sheer artistry of the special effects crew. Suffice to say, Jude Law, Angelina Jolie and particularly Gwyneth Paltrow have never looked more beautiful or stunning. Giovanni Ribisi is excellent as always in a smaller role, but the real star of the movie is its visionary director, Kerry Conran. Although I wouldn't want to see a lot of movies filmed in this manner, one must admit the excellence and hard work that went behind it."
4,I admired it more than I liked it,"Making this movie required more than technical skill - it required chutzpah and guts on a monumental scale. Ultimately, the film makers' reach exceeded their grasp, but it was a wonderful effort.The movie is all style - a 1930's alternate universe with all the sensibilities of classic comic books and film noir. The characters are all stereotypes with a few nods to modern sensibilities.If you can immerse yourself in its world and appreciate the skill and artistry that created it, you can have a good time. But not everyone can do that, so they should avoid it. I'm old enough to remember some of the early serials from which it draws its inspiration. I was also fortunate enough to have seen it in a wonderful theater where they played old B&W; Flash Gordon serial episodes between showings. I'll probably next see it on DVD where I can take in all of the peripheral tidbits I missed in one viewing.Conditionally recommended."
5,Greate Movie,"wow... this movie has a very 60's style...i mean, the story it's really cool and the characters played amazing.i recomended this movie... very very different."
4,What's this? A multimillion dollar Guy Maddin movie? Cool!,"This is an extremely anachronistic yarn that reminds me of a Guy Maddin movie for two reasons.It borrows the colors, camera angles, whipes, dissolves, designs and tone of an old German expressionist movie and it also seems to be specifically for people who love film and can identify the homages being paid here. I'm not sure why they did it, exactly, but I'm glad they did and I'm glad they dove in, unapologetically, and made this beautifully artificial machine that has heaps of heart and humor, even if the heart exists entirely in binary code.""Sky Captain"" also pays great nods to the old Superman matinee cartoons, Orson Welles and both ""Indiana Jones"" and the myriad influences that made Indy possible in the first place.A strange and wonderful experiment that won't be for everyone but that manages to outweigh its indulgence with sheer stylistic audacity. Oh, and it's also a lot of fun."
3,Style over substance...,"This is a love-it-or-hate-it movie if there ever was one. OK, I don't think anybody out there will call it ""great,"" but it is definitely unique. The type of person who will hate it, I think, is the one who has know love (or knowledge) of the pop-culture of yesteryear. Let me put it this way - if you've never seen the original King Kong, you're not going to like this film.I was reminded of King Kong all the way through Sky Captain. The film tries to capture the sense of wonder from depression-era sci-fi. It takes place in an alternate history where the Hindenburg III blimp docks at the Empire State Building. Everything is art deco - huge open spaces are the norm.It's true, the story should have been better - there is little dramatic tension because everything is so tongue-in-cheek, you don't really take anything on screen seriously. But, in the end, this film is all about look - and it looks great."
4,This is fun,"That is all you need to know about this movie. The story is the usual fare about a hero saving the world from the monsters. It is beautiful to look at and the retro look is perfect for this type of movie. Both Jude Law and Gweneth Paltrow are average as the leads, altough there is chemistry between them. As I said, there is nothing new here but that doesn't matter. It is very cool to look at. The film is based on the old serials of the late forties and early fifties. Think of the fun of ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" and the darkness of ""Batman"" and you catch the feel of ""Sky Captain"". There are ray guns and metal monsters along with evil bad guys. There is a villianess that is down right creepy becasue she is never explained. This is eye candy, nothing more but that is OK because it is such pleasing eye candy. Highly Reccomended."
4,Fun and Original,"It took awhile to get used to the CGI sets, but after awhile you forget about them as you are pulled into the story. The special effects were quite good at creating an old-fashioned atmosphere for the film, and I thought the characters all had good chemistry, especially Law and Paltrow. Do not go into this movie expecting anything serious, and it is certainly not logical, but aside from a few slow spots Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow never fails to entertain."
4,Nice tip of the hat to vintage cliff hangers,"Filmed as in the genre of the weekly cliff hangers from old cinema.Great graphics, directing is good.Story line is interesting, the actors are good in the characters.Jude Law is excellent in the main lead spot.Gwyneth Paltrow is great as the perky reporter.Angelina Jolie is perfect in her part.If you like the old 1940's cartoons, cliff hangers, you'll like this movie."
5,"yep, crazy 1940's","liked the scenery, liked the story line, like the twist (you'll get it when you see it), like the characters, liked the graphics. wish there was a sequel."
3,Escapist fun; drags in spots,"(3 & 1/2 stars) I generally enjoyed this movie. The imagination and creativity of the ideas was worth seeing, and I like the ""retro"" feel of the visuals - although that fuzzy washed-out look DID get a little irritating at times. Ideas like the floating ""mobile airstrips,"" the rocket ship, and the ""amphibious squadron"" were cool to see. And there are great Buck Rogers-ish aspects like the ""heat beam"" ray gun invented by Ribisi's character Dex. An homage to the old Saturday afternoon serials, the story also reminded me at times of the Star Wars series -- not as much in the sci-fi department, more in the way the characters are constantly being placed in peril and having to escape. However, there are several places in the movie where things get a little boring - I heard people around me yawning, and my own attention was drifting. So in sum, I had fun overall with Sky Captain, but it's no classic."
3,Graphic designers are not movie directors,"In the extras short on the DVD Kerry Conran (?) talks about the movie - he talks about references and inspirations, he talks about the look of the settings, the look of the machines, never once does he mention the plot. The question is, did he or anyone give much thought to the plot, other than as a way to present the 'look' and the FX.Now you are saying, ""Ok, if you are so smart, how would you do it?"" First I would have 'fleshed' out the robot girl, great potential for a evil villain left on the table. Second more Dex (Sp?)- the best acting in the movie and last more action.Unfortunately this is a movie that gets more boring on second viewing, my recommendation is rent it, watch it once and send it back."
4,Pretty good flick,"A pretty good high adventure flick. Not too complicated a plot, and of course, you have to suspend disbelief with some of it, but the action moves right along, and the acting is pretty well done. It has shades of ""Romancing the Stone"" or any of the Indiana Jones movies. Some of the scenery is quite impressive, and I particularly like the Art Deco feel they put to the whole production. I'd watch it again."
1,"Worse than ""Battlefield Earth""","Yes, I said it. This movie is worse than ""Battlefield Earth"", if you can imagine that. The CGI looks stunning, so maybe if you watch this movie on mute it could be bearable. Otherwise, it's too horrible for words."
1,one of the worst ever watched,"bad screenplay, poor actings, terrible directing, editing.even by comic book standard, this is so bad a movie that almost made me kill myself during watching. the plot is so contrite, the acting so pretentious, the whole movie is just like watching a junkyard, full of copycatting indiana jones, star wars, juraissic park, lord of the ring... whatever other unnamed movies junks coming up to your mind. so many scenes looked so familiar as seen in the other scifi or fantasy movies. none of the actors had put 1% of the heart into it. so un-thrilled, uninspired, uninterested, so bored. my god, shall i continue my blabbing?"
1,Bad! Bad! Bad!,"The is film is just plain 'ole bad. I'm with that other reviewer, Paramount is sitting on this film because they can smell the STINK clear back to Hollywood. Another in a long list of recent Paramount stinkeroos.(Stepford Wives Anyone?) Ugh! This was a PAINFUL film. Ugh!! Somebody pass the aspirin. I can't believe the NH guy said Law is the next Harrison Ford(Indiana Jones)? ????????????? Wow!! Special FX don't make a movies great. FX should ADD to the film not MAKE the film. Wait for the DVD and even then, don't buy it. Just rent it when you nothing better to do."
3,Refreshing Rock & Roll,"Tripped on this band on the internet somehow. Bought Me and Otto, which I think is the best of their albums. A guitar & drums band with catchy vocals. Favorites: Me & Otto, Certain Girls, Green & My Fault. Not epic but good stuff."
2,Didn't work for me,"The first half of this CD is spoken, presumably taking you through a relaxation process. Unfortunately, the voice is so muffled, I couldn't understand half of what he was saying. Five minutes of straining to understand was sufficiently annoying to make me switch to the second half, which is music only. However, I found this music too fast and shrill to be at all restful. In the final analysis, the hum of my airconditioner is more soporific than this production."
3,"Track 1 is good, Track 2 is not relaxing at all!!","I have to agree with the other reviewers who have said that the 2nd track (Music for Sleeping) startled them awake when it came on. It is loud and uplifting, not relaxing at all. It felt like the alarm clock was going off. But I think the first track is really good, and I was asleep before the end. So as someone else suggested, I burned just track 1 onto another CD and it works out fine. DON'T BE FOOLED by the sample of track 2 that you can listen to on the website, it is NOT representative of the actual track. Overall, I am not sorry I bought it because like I said, the first track puts me right to sleep. I would suggest not paying alot for it however, as only part of it is useful - do like I did and buy it used from one of the marketplace sellers for under $10 (including shipping and handling)."
3,good for an old read,"Fun to read. However, the characters are a little slow witted and the plot winds down in a boring way."
1,Not a good digital copy,"The book is great, but the file is corrupt. It skips from 44% to 77% to the end of the book. You can 'flip' the pages to go back, but you can't get any closer than 47% or so.Had to read the book online through Project Gutenberg instead."
1,flawed kindle addition,"I HAD TO RETURN THIS VERSION BECAUSE IT WAS FLAWED AND DIDNT WORK ON MY KINDLE---PAGES KEPT JUMPING TO END ETC ---AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THEY WOULD REPORT IT AND FIX IT BUT I DONT KNOW, SO ----BEWARE---IT WAS A MESS AND I NEVER GOT TO READ THE BOOK---NO STARS!!"
4,A very creepy story,"I'm not into vampire stories, although I went through a phase of reading Anne Rice back in the 80s, but more for the complex world she built than for the vampires per se, but I enjoyed Carmilla. Carmilla is truly creepy, and it's a great psychological horror piece. The evil in Carmilla is beautiful, both repulsive and attractive at the same time, and just slightly out of reach until the end.The story is well-developed and yet not terribly long, and it was a fast and easy read. I really recommend it to anyone who likes Gothic horror -- or even to those who enjoy period fiction. The story was written in the 1870s, but takes place supposedly in the 1820s."
4,"Great vampire book, even by today's standards...","This book was great. I'm trying not to give it a five star, because it's just a little too short for me. And the end left me needing more. For lack of spoilers, I won't go on about that. It's one of the best vampire books I think out there, a true classic and it predates Dracula. The language isn't too hard to get used to. I would definitely reread this book."
4,closest version to the novel,"After reading the novel, I thought the plot dealt on the highest degree of revenge I have ever experienced. Alexandre Dumas has great skill for describing the inconceivable. I liked how he intertwined history with his story and I liked that he would allude to other great writings (e.g. Arabian Nights). This French mini-series is the closest film version I have found of the Count of Monte Cristo. If you really like the book like I did, then you will find a way to track a copy of this mini-series down to watch it."
3,Subtitles,The DVD was good but of course long. If you don't understand French plan to see it twice. Followed the book.
1,Don't Buy This!,"OK, whoever thinks that this adaptation is acceptable has obviously not read the book. The only thing that the mini-series has in common with the book is the title. This adaptation has deleted about half of the characters and added a few more. Those that remain are the worse off--they're made so simple and ridiculous. It's understandable that any adaptation would fall short of the book. I'd suggest buying a copy of the book and enjoy every page of it. There are much better uses of plastic than to make additional copies of this movie."
5,An Exceptional Tale,"The Count of Monte Cristo story has always interested me and I had been curious about this version since I first heard about it. I sat down to begin watching it and spent the next almost seven hours drawn to the tale all over again in a new way. An old story told once again, this time with fuller and richer detail and more compelling than ever. The Bravo version is far superior to any version from Hollywood. At first I was disappointed by the English sub-titles but now I must say the movie was better for it - I enjoyed the French dialogue (it immersed one more in the setting) and the sub-titles forced me to focus much more on what was happening. Gerard Depardieu was a very believable Edmond Dantes and the writers did wonders with the script. While this version is too long for someone looking for a quick movie fix it is worth every minute of it when you take the time to see it all."
1,A stain upon the book,"The plot loosely follows that of the book, but changes so much that it is nearly impossible to care about any of the characters in the story. So terribad."
4,Magnifique,"This mini-series may not be the best adaptation from a novel, but was certainly very entertaining to watch. We purchased the DVD and watched it in three consecutive nights. In all sincerity, I could not wait to come home in the evenings to start watching it with my dear wife who enjoyed the show as much as I did, eventhough she is not a French speaker.This is an extremely well done mini series. Superb casting lead by Gerard Depardieux, minute attention to detail, and unbelievable dialogue in French. I only wish the DVD contained more extras such as making of the mini-series, and the sound and picture quality were better. Nevetheless, I immediately placed an order with Amazon.com for ""Balzac"", another mini-series with the same director, the majority of the cast from Monte Cristo and Gerard Depardieux."
3,Good movie - Poor dvd,"I'm not going to knock the movie at all - it is my favorite adaptation of the novel. My only complaint is with the dvd's quality. The scenes jump into each other a bit too quickly, perhaps not enough time was taken editing. But more annoying to me is the frequency in which the movie pauses. Granted it's part of watching a dvd to see it stall occassionally, but this one stalls five times on the first disc! Now I used to work at a rental store I know how to care for dvd's and what to expect, and stalling that frequently the first time through definitely does not bode well for future playing. The movie itself is worth the trouble for me, but then Dumas is one of my favorite authors!"
3,Watch everything except last half hour.,"It's a superb production in many ways. The detail, the acting (it really doesn't matter that Depardieu is large as some other reviewers mention; he still owns the part), fidelity to the novel. Until the last half hour when the director for some reason decided that it needed a happy (!!!) ending. Mr. and Mrs. Romeo and Juliet are alive and well and living on the beach somewhere..."
1,It doesn't deserve the title.,"When I saw Dantes shaved so clean in his cell, I know this is not going to be a real one.This is not the greatest novel, not at all. The touching scenes and subtle feeling are all gone. The added fake stories and dialog just created a new and not compelling Dantes I never saw from the book. It may be a mediocre drama base on a new novel, instead of an adaptation. In either case, it doesn't deserve the title, 'The Count of Monte Cristo'.If you never read the book (full edition), I suggest you do not rate with so many star, because:1. You'll find you need 10 star to rate the book if you read it.2. It makes the fan of the book, like me, waste the money and time on these two pieces of plastic."
4,Gave as a gift,Very entertaining and enjoyable in French. Was suggested as a Christmas gift and I am not one to ignore suggestions.
3,Too Revisionist,"Why would somebody make an absolutely riveting production of this Dumas classic and then keep weaving 1960's European socialist values awkwardly into the story? Dumas wove a tale about a man done wrong to the marrow who, through a twist of Divine intervention, sets out on a quest to bring justice to his life. Yet, this production, almost seems to highlight the liberal messages of prison reform and the dirtiness of wealth more than the tale's plot. Is it just trendy to ruin classics with revisionist political correctness? I will not ruin the viewer's anticipation of the ending by giving it away here, but don't sit on the edge of your seat! After almost 400 minutes of intense plot and sub-plots, this production ends on an unrealistically childish note. Funny how the last five minutes of weak adaptation can destroy the first 355 minutes of intense anticipation! I'll stick with the Donat or Chamberlin productions."
4,gerard depardieu - need i say more,"this dvd was bought for multiple reasons. gerard depardieu, french language, classical drama.did not disappoint in any area. great classical flick, great acting, great costumes, ..someday, i am sure, i will be watching it, again. [cannot disagree with the observation on the 'plump depardieu' being release from prison as a bit of a stretch!'and, i wish, of course, that it were not full frame"
1,"Magnificient production, classic plot made much worse","The production is opulent. The contents is terrible.The original story is a melodrama with some silliness, and this was an opportunity to use just the best part of this classic. Unfortunately, the very great liberties taken with the original have had the effect of adding more absurdities and silliness.An example of a disastrous tampering with the original: The new version adds an irrelevant love affair for Dantes. The woman, not in the original, keeps groveling for Dantes to spend the night with her. He finally does as a favor for her, and she is ecstatic. Supposedly nothing would be more important for her than to spend the rest of her life with him. Well, he offers her that but she insists on his going back to his Mercedes, now much the worse for wear. This soap-opera kitch is pure invention."
1,Boring,"Boring, boring Please don't make us write all these words. It keeps you from getting reviews. I cannot spend this much time."
1,"Just a little more info, the end already ruined","It's faithful to the book except that: the book has more detail, of course; there is an introduction of another female character who ""teaches the Count to love again and forget his revenge"" which is supposedly the reason he can forgive Mercedes enough to be with her again; Haydee, the princess, is there, but only to serve witness against the count's enemy (as opposed to also being his lover and the woman he sails off with at the end of the book); and, while they do show the Count's use of disguises, it's a lot more played down in the movie than in the book, which is important because it had shown how truly intelligent and deceptive that the Count had become, that he could fool others who ""knew"" him into thinking he was a completely different person. There are other little differences, but the ones just mentioned are the ones I feel the most important. Otherwise it is fairly faithful to the book."
4,"Great acting, adaptation not so great","Depardieu does a great job playing french sailor Edmond Dantès in this french literature classic. The series sticks to the book at much as it can with bittersweet results. I didn't like the fact that some characters were unecessarily added and that the ending is modified dramatically. I would strongly recommend you read the unabridged version so that you get the full array of emotions contained in this masterpiece. The one thing I didn't like about this Dantès is that the literary one is sad and full of melancholy rather than angry and wrathful. In the book, even while executing his vengeful plans he regrets having to do this since he never did anything to deserve the hell he went through. Anyway, this DVD collection is just fine and I hope you pick up the book and be swept away to a world of deception, treason, revenge, love and inner knowledge."
1,no need to call Miss Cleo: you already know it's awful!,"The name ""Ghetto Fabulous"" is meant to be ironic. A drug dealer states early that his trade is anything about glitzy and full of hot chicks. Still, this had too many actors of which it was hard to differentiate. At one point, there are captions for actors who can be clearly heard and are not using that much vernacular. The characters say one thing and do another in haphazard fashions.Now maybe I just got a bad copy. But this had no menu. The film starts and that's it. There's no Spanish subtitles, no chapter selection options, nothing. That just adds to the subpar quality of the DVD.What a waste!"
4,"Old ""Tanglefoot"" ~ A True Baseball Legend","`Pride of the Yankees' released in '43 just 4 years after Lou Gehrigs bittersweet retirement is a loving, though overly sentimental tribute to the New York Yankee legend who died of what is now known as Lou Gehrigs' disease.This is one of the most beloved sports films of all time. The scenes of Cooper on the baseball field, interacting with other players in the locker room, or traveling to away games on a train boxcar are the best parts of the movie. They are especially enjoyable because you get the rare opportunity to see the real Babe Ruth playing himself. However some of the romantic scenes with love interest Eleanor Twitchell (Teresa Wright) are really dated and overly sacrine, making them difficult to watch with a straight face.If you're a baseball fan, or a Gary Cooper fan you'll overlook it's shortcomings. Still good for viewing if you're not such a fan. Also starring Walter Brennan."
5,The Pride of the Yankees,The Pride of the Yankees is an old classic which has not lost anything through the years. I would recommend it to anyone and not just a baseball fan!
5,the pride of the yankees,one of the very best of all movies. teresa wright to ma will always be mrs. lou gehriggary cooper is great as alwways. and the appearance of bill dickey and babe ruth is indeed special.
5,Pride of the Yankees,"Arguably the greatest sports movie of all time.A great movie for all,I would have to think that you wouldbe very hard pressed to find a more enjoyable movie. You willbe a fan of Baseball and Lou Gerig. Be ready to laugh,cry,and feel good."
5,This movie covers everything about Lou Gehrig.,"Pride of the Yankees gives a great look at Lou Gehrig's life. For anyone interested in finding out more about this truly shy ""momma's boy"" this is probably the best way to do it. The movie begins with Lou's fascination with baseball as a boy. Then the story moves on to his days at Columbia, his years as a Yankee, how he and Elenor got together, and finally to how the two of them dealt with his fatal disease. This is one great movie for any baseball fan."
1,NOT ANOTHER EDITION!,"How many editions are there going to be? They have special editions, ultimate, anniversary, etc. Instead of coming out with the same movie over and over again, how about putting some more classics out there. The African Queen, Cavalcade, Samson and Delilah and The Uninvited, to name just 4, still aren't on DVD yet!"
5,Perfect!,I accidently broke the globe that was on a garden angel statue given to us when my mother-in-law passed away. This beautiful globe fits perfectly and looks absolutely wonderful. The color is very beautiful and rich - much nicer than the picture displayed. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition - both much appreciated.
1,Mirrored Gazing Globe Mauve,I was not at all happy with the purchase of this item when it arrived. As I opened the box from the base of the gazing ball it had a serious crack in it. The only happiness was the outcome of the excellent customer service provided when I notified Amazon of the damaged item I was immediately credited for the damaged item. I also did not realize that this particular mirrored gazing globe was no bigger than a Christmas tree ornament.
1,stay away from this product,"I first bought this item with the boombox.(big mistake)receiver was alway very hot to the touch after use.After a little over a year(one year warrenty)it burnt out.I replaced the receiver and after a little over another year, the sheild around the connection point for the antenna broke away. It could not see the antenna anymore.I then replaced the received a third time. It only worked for 3.5 hours,then went silent,it would not re-activate after that.I have now returned it and bought the Stiletto 100 from Sirius. IT IS AWSOME!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!! Stay away from all X-act products.The service at X-act is even worse then their products."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I love satellite radio but I would be cautious about buying an Xact unit. Xact products carry a 12 month warranty. At exactly 13 months the unit stopped working. Xact customer service informed me they were no longer responsible for the unit. Before buying this product search the web and you will find many ""13 month"" stories. Instead, I would suggest buying directly from Sirius."
1,Yellic,"The plastic breaks too easily, the piece that broke off holds it in the dash. The package was missing all of the screws listed on the inventory. It did not fit well, the mounts are slots and too narrowly spaced so the screws just barely hold it in and it sits into the dash about half an inch too deep. I will shop for a different one and replace it as soon as I can."
3,Good price but not perfect for my car,"This product is a good value at the price and easy to install. But it doesn't have the cabinet, the space under the car stereo for storage purpose. If you don't care about that cabinet, this is a good car radio housing case to buy. Otherwise, go find another more expensive one."
5,Dragon Doom,This is one the best books i have read.It has everything you could want in a book love hate war courage it has it all.I read a review about this book and it said that a passage from it was on pg56 its on pg57Would you fight to the deathFor that which you loveIn a cause surely hopelessFor that which you love.Dennis L. Mckiernanis the best.
1,Still Thieving from Tolkien,The entire story of this book was lifted from an appendix to the Lord of the Rings. It is found in the appendix section dealing with the history of the Rohirrim. This McKiernan dude is incapable of writing anything worth reading. If you've finished reading LOTR and you want to read something else similar... just read LOTR again. Seriously.
3,Decent. Mouse has limited range.,"I am satisfied, especially for the price, with this purchase. My one complaint is that the mouse requires a pad, and it has very limited range from the receiver before it doesn't work well."
1,Set Your Goals - Reset,I did not receive the album I ordered. I waited almost a week and a half and I had to return the album they sent me because it was not the right purchase.
2,Not Quite Traditional,"I purchased this book because I was looking for quick tsukemono to add into bento lunches and as accompaniments to meals. I did not find traditional japanese tsukemono in this book, and I was very disappointed. The author combines french cuisine with japanese pickling techniques.I made several of the recipes in this book and none of them were to my liking, usually too bland or too singularly flavored (too much sweet or too much salty, not enough mixing of flavors).The pictures in the book are excellent and the author does a thorough job of explaining pickling with rice bran. If you're looking for more of a western-eastern fusion type of thing, this book would serve you well. If you're looking for ""traditional"" tsukemono, go elsewhere.(corrected per comment below - thanks!)"
3,Easy Japanese Pickling in Five Minutes to One Day,"This book was very interesting, I tried some of the recipes in the book with food I have accessible to me and sub others. I must say it turned pretty easy and tasted great. I'd recommend it to anyone that's not afraid of experimenting and dares to try new things."
1,Haven't Liked the Recipes!!,"I recently moved to Japan and have picked up Japanese cooking. I have tried many of the recipes in the this book and have only encountered a couple that I kind of liked. Also some of the directions are not very clear. Maybe it's good for some people, but I'm not happy with it."
4,This is good!,"Ever since I heard The Hardest Thing on a compilation that MTV Asia put together on a CD, I have liked this song. Invisible Man was not all that bad either. Very good effort from Nick, Jeff, Drew and Justin!"
3,No Artist list on this although it is a compilation of different artists there is no way to tell who they are.OPoor job on Amazo,"I will give this items amazon page a low or poor review because this is a compilation album, but there is no list to tell who the artists are.Poor job on amazons part.How can i decide wether to buy? Dont know who's on it."
2,Not Bad,I used the Cyclops 5 led light for a couple of weeks and now the on/off button no longer works after 15-20 uses so I have to remove one of the batteries to shut it off. Has plenty of light so it's not bad but cheaply made.
1,One of the Worst,"I tried it and boy, was it a looser. One of the absolute worst racing games I have tried. Totally not realistic. Lousy graphics, lousy controls, really just a kids game, for ages 5-10 years old."
1,Insulting,"The idea was interesting. That's the one star of this review. But as far as fiction goes, the rest is lacking in everything. Plot is ridiculous, characters are weak and unrealistic, dialogue is no stronger than a made-for-TV movie, and even more shocking.. there are countless grammatical mistakes littered throughout the novel.If you are an intellegent person, your reading dollar belongs in better reading. Consider ""The Da Vinci Code"" by Dan Brown, as this series seems to be a retaliatory effort gone horribly bad targeted at that eye-opener. I strongly urge you to pursue a more objective (and less ludicrous!) piece of fiction."
1,Can I get a refund?,"If the authors spent less time engaged in bible-thumping, in-your-face evangelism...... they might've had a mediocre story. Instead, woodenly clumsy characters are used to deliver a literalist view of the Christian Bible..... making for an annoyingly shallow read."
1,Babylon Falling,Like many I picked this book up thinking that the quality would be on par with the left behind series. Boy are we all disappointed! It could have been a very good book had it not been so poorly written. I forced myself to finish but my husband couldn't even do that. Major flop.
1,Babylon falling!!,"I have not read any of the Left Behind books, but had heard so many good reviews, I couldn't wait to check out this new series.What a disappointment!! I was so completely bored, I could barely make it through. I felt like I was back in elementary school reading a book for homework. It was all I could do to not laugh at the ridiculous plot and characters....very generic and boring.I will not put myself through the next book in the series, but will try to see if Left Behind was what people claimed it was...."
1,Babylon Flop,"I bought this book because that author stressed in his introductory message what a great book he had written...thrilling, gripping etc. Well, it isn't. Most of the action scenarios were ridiculous.The plot was predictable but thesituations beyond belief. Even in fiction, can anyone fly into a desert and in less than 24 hours find a biblical artifact that has been hidden and buried for millenia in an abandoned ancient sewer, under a modern day city. And later the hero is able to wiggle through an air shaft in a pyramid, that initially was barely able to admit a small remote control drone. And when he reaches the inner sanctum of the pyramid, the bad guy ""Talon"" is waiting inside with his trained killer falcons. Fortunately, the hero was able to kill one of the attacking falcons with his bow and arrow!Bantam published this book but I bet they won't run the series."
2,Implausible storyline,"I just couldn't ""get into"" this book. I've read the Left Behind series and love it, and had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, I couldn't suspend my disbelieve high enough to get over the totally implausible storyline. A guy who tries to kill Murphy (repeatedly) to get his tantilizing finds? What's the point? And why would Murphy consistently do it?A secret organization trying to convince the world that ""evangelical Christians"" are bad? I just couldn't believe it. And Talon. Totally couldn't believe anything he did. Killing people left and right when there were likely cleaner and safer ways to do the same things. It was more Hollywood than anything resembling reality. At least Left Behind told a plausible story.I put the book down when I was about halfway through and gave up.I'll give it an extra star for good writing style, but the complete implausibility of the story line was a real turn off."
1,Leave this one behind....,"This book is insulting. I gave it a one star as I cannot give it a 0.First, I am an evangelical Christian minister, I am also a student of Biblical Archaeology.*if* an archaeologist *were* to discover a portion of the brazen serpent, the last thing he would do would be to go into the lecture hall with ""Hey everybody, lookie what I found!""This book is poorly written, the scenes are terrible, the character development abysmal. Very unrealistic. We are in the end times. If this is meant to be a warning to those without the houshold, I am afraid they will view it as bad comedy. We can do better than that church....Sad that work of the King of heaven is represented so poorly.Brother LaHaye...find a day job."
1,Disappointment at it's Highest,"Having read the Left Behind series, and having huge respect for Tim Lehaye, this book was just awful. I am halfway finished and can't motivate to even read any more. First 10-12 Chapters are confusing, too many characters, places, events, all appearing unrelated, (maybe a 1,000 more pages will pull it together). I feel as if I should take notes so I can try to figure out, now who is he? why did they say that? etc... Worst book I have ever read and hardest to comprehend. I like to read at night. 1-2 Chapters daily. With this book, you can't keep anything straight. It just sucked."
1,Half way through and regretting that I ever cracked the book,"Run away now, while you still have the chance. At very least, check this one out at the library, don't buy it.While the premise is intriguing, the plot, dialog and character development are very poor. Definitely far below the quality of the 'Left Behind' series."
2,Not even close!,"This was so far below an adult reading level that it killed the book. I agree with the other reviewers. The characters were not very developed or particularly believable. It seemed a little like a far-fetched super-hero movie. The timing was always perfect, they always guessed exactly where to find each item. Like I said to my husband....Tim LaHaye needs to stick to what he's good at....the research. The Left Behind Series is so good.....and this just isn't."
1,Bayblon Rising just fell,"Aside from poor writing and shallow character development this series is at best and outline for possible developments. We are introduced to Will Bingman who goes with Murphy to find the handwriting on the wall and miraculously escapes an earthquake. It shook him up so much his name is changed to Bingham as he pops up out of the rubble!(page 311) On page 320 he needs to go home to his wife and kids and again on 322 we rejoice in his survival! Sadly though he is again Will Bingman and apparently dead only four pages later... come come Mr LaHaye, we Christians have enough ridicule without simpleton material like this.. I remain however your loving sister in Christ."
3,Great beginning to what seems a great series,Loved this book and look forward to the rest of the series. I never thought of the brazen serpent as important but I gained some new insight for further thought.
3,Too Many Typographical Errors,"Was it just me, or did anyone else catch all the typographical and grammatical errors? It was seriously irritating and very distracting. The most common error was the omission of ""Shari's"" name in a lot of places. I was very disappointed in the quality. Didn't someone proof this eBook before it was published?Besides that, I liked the plot, but I hope the next books in the series are more developed. The ending of Babylon Rising was anti-climatic. I like LaHaye's other books so I am really looking forward to this series getting better."
3,Just ok,"I really enjoyed the left behind series and had hoped for more in this new series of books. This just didn't seem to have the ""heart"" that left behind did and I found myself never really connecting with rather mediocre characterization and plotting."
2,LAUGHABLE - Was this meant to be a comedy??,"I have not read the 'Left Behind' series and was looking forward to listening to a gripping book with a Christian flavour. Instead I found an incredably predictable, shallow story which was nothing more than a poor patchwork of other more notable adventure books/films. The characters were very shallow and not credible in any way. I was continually wincing at the portrayal of 'Mr and Mrs SuperChristian' whos only emotions were gooey lovey dovey or holier than thou anger. GET REAL!!The narration was ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS. I found the strong, nasal American accent grating to say the least and the attempts at foreign accents were pitiful. There were great Pakistani and Australian accents - shame there weren't any Pakistani or Australian characters in the book (I think he was going for Scottish and South African). Soooooo disappointed, won't be reading or listening to any more of his books.How did this guy write a best seller??"
3,Watered-Down Indiana Jones,"Having read the first three books of the Left Behind series, I was thrilled when I saw Babylon Rising sitting on the shelf. I was hooked by the first chapter. The character of Michael Murphy had such promise in the beginning. But he became more stereotypical as the story progressed to the point where I almost lost interest in reading the rest of the book.For instance, I felt that he bounced back way too quickly from a devastating personal loss. Then there was Isis, who jumped from wimp to heroine in the space of a chapter. She didn't impress me at all.As for the plot, I'm curious to see where LaHaye takes it. So, I will wait for the sequel (due next Fall). You can check out the book's website at www.babylonrisingbook.com and to learn how LaHaye got his idea for the series and to post feedback."
3,A Good and Interesting Book,"This first book of the Babylon Rising series, like the author's other books in the Left Behind Series, was very informative, very interesting, very thought provoking, and overall a good book. This book was also a little less ""preachy/didactic) then those in the Left Behind series. Why, then, do I say good and not great? Well, it is the authors craft, or lack thereof, as a developer of characters. His character development is weak, stereotypichal, and often cliched. Did I still enjoy the book? Yes. Will I read the others in the story? Yes. I just wish he would spend a little more time making us care about his characters."
4,Tim Lahaye has done it agian !,Babylon Rising is packed full of adventure and suspence.Once you start reading it's imposible to stop. As MichaelMurphy goes in search of the Golden Serpant made by Moses.He is stalked by many who want to ruin his good name. It'sa battle of good vs evil in this Christian Indian Jones.He is shot at in a cave in Samaria and even fights a lion.If you love action and trills Babylon Rising is for you.
1,disappointed!,"I ordered this thinking I might like it but was so disappointed. The characters were two-dimensional, their actions predictable, and their heroism not convincing. I thought the plot and character names were cheesy. The violence described was enough to disturb me and there was nothing to redeem that. I have read good literature with a message that honors God and this book, in my uneducated opinion, does not fall into that category. Maybe some of his other books I would like better?"
4,Better then what the last five books of Left Behind Series,I will agree that the character development had something to be desired. At least the book could stand on its own. Lately the only good parts to the LB series have been the beginning to reconcile the cliff hanger from the previous book and a new cliff hanger to wait for in the next book.I would like the next book to be a little more advanced.
1,Babylon Risible,"This is possibly the worst book I've ever bought. How did La Haye's editor ever allow this mess?The characters and action are low-grade comic book. Behaviours range from sanctimonious to psycho-hysterical, with none of it remotely credible. Even the lion doesn't act believably. I found myself wondering whether it was a self parody, like ""True Lies"" -- but without any wit.Multiplying the florid, overblown and hackneyed events is La Haye's mind numbing repetitiveness, as if by belaboring his pseudo-facts he can somehow make them sound true.When he compounded these abuses by adding pompous proselytizing, I brought out the gong."
1,Sheer Boredom... Zero Rapture Here,I just had to put this drivel story down after 25%. I like a good story but reading this felt like reading someone's slanted religious propaganda. I wish the cover had a warning. Christianity is fine with me but I don't want to be hit over the head with it on each and every page.Wooden stereotypical characters and impossible plotting with poor writting and dialogue sinks this one for me. Of course the super-secret-organization-deadly-out-to-get-Christians is laughable comedy. Gggeeezzz. The Rev Jim Jones must have written this one. DON'T DRINK THE KOOL-AID.If I'm in a religious mood I'll read the Bible--the writing is much better and so are the stories. If you like bad simplistic fantasy Christian ficton this one is for you.
3,"Didn't hate it, didn't love it.","I can tell you that I didn't hate this book, but I didn't love it either. I did however learn a few things. I would read something in the book and think ""Really?"" then verify it or not verify it with outside sources. Made me think. Anyway it wasn't really plausible . . . an archeologist wouldn't do quite so much damage in quite so many irreplaceable dig sites at least I wouldn't and I'm not even an archeologist and you can't grab the barrell of an AK-47 when it's firing without burning yourself, but you can't really flip through the air and kick 4 people standing in a circle and still land on your feet like they do on TV either. It's a great idea. I just wish it had been executed a little better."
2,DONT BOTHER,"LET ME START BY SAYING, I LOVED THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES, AND RECOMMENDED THEM TO EVERYONE I KNOW, BUT THIS NEW BOOK IS JUST NOT UP TO STANDARD. THE HERO MURPHY IS LIKEABLE ENOUGH, BUT THE PLOT IS SO LACKING! ITS AS IF THIS PROFESSOR (MURPHY) WHO TEACHES COLLEGE ARCHEOLOGY, CAN GO ALL OVER THE WORLD AND FIND ANCIENT ARTIFACTS WITH VERY LITTLE EFFORT ON THE FIRST TRY, THAT OTHERS HAVE SOMEHOW OVERLOOKED!! UNBELIEVABLE. IT LACKS THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND PLOT OF THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES, WHICH I COULDNT PUT DOWN. I WONT BE CONTINUEING ON WITH THIS SERIES..."
2,"Great concept, awful execution.","It's obvious that LaHaye has a gift for thinking of creative plots, and this one could have been a winner.However, the best word that comes to mind to describe the actual character development, interaction, and adventures is ""Cheesy."" It's almost like he's trying to take a ""DaVinci code"" approach yet having a 9th grader write it. It's really unfortunate that it falls so short from a literary perspective, because the story idea is a great one.I pretty much agree with the first reviewer's sentiments."
2,A Fair Read,"Having read the Left Behind series, I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I can firmly say and believe that Jerry Jenkins was the real talent in that series. The writing in this book was fair. The book was predictable and not up to speed in the suspense department. I do not intend to buy the next installment."
2,What happened?,"I have for a long time enjoyed Tim Lahaye's writing, and am a big fan of most of the Left Behind books. What happened to character development?"
4,Babylon Rising,"This book was a great read just like the rest of his books. Michael is a wonderful character. It had the same affect on me as the Left Behind series. Babylon Rising will keep you up reading for hours and hours. I dont know what else to say excpet that if you haven't read it yet. Get a copy of it and read it. It's has all the action like ""Lara Croft's Tomb Raider"" and has the Christian aspect to it. Enjoy!"
2,Almost so bad it's good.,"Ok. I've removed my previous one star review after re-reading the book (my first ""reading"" was listening to the audiobook).I still think the story (involving an Illuminati-type group launching a conspiracy against evangelical Christians, and an assassin who murders people with falcons trained to attack and kill people) is ludicrous, the characters silly and the dialogue laughable. But I've got to admit that these... ""qualities"" actually make the book rather amusing, in a ""so bad it's good"" kind of way.It's common knowledge that Tim LaHaye doesn't do any actual writing on any of ""his"" novels, and this time he's found another hack co-writer in Greg Dinallo.Anybody looking for a good adventure novel should look elsewhere. But those looking for an example of brainless Christian fiction at its worst may find ""Babylon Rising"" amusing, although it does contain some rather slow sequences."
1,Better luck next time!,"I was very disappointed with this book. The blurb promised a great story with much excitement which the inside pages failed to deliver. I am a great fan of biblical archaeology especially when combined with adventure, but this was a thinly disguised sermon. In fact, this was sermon after long sermon interspaced with little bits of fragmented plot which seemed designed more for the launching of yet another sermon and did little to promote the story. This could have been one phenominal novel had the plot and action flowed more smoothly, the characters been better developed and the sermons MUCH more subtly woven into the context of the story itself. Better luck with the sequel."
1,This is NOT Left Behind!,"I was eager to start this book after reading the Left Behind series as I felt LaHaye and Jenkins wrote a good series, even if it was a litte drawn out. I was very disappointed in LaHaye's attempt however. The story line is juvenile, full of holes, and portions of the story are totally inconceivable (e.g. how does a woman who has just been strangled to death at the end of the chapter, later, stumble into a police station interrogation room an collapse in her husband arms?). I haven't even finished the book yet and I'm not sure I'll be able to. A friend of mine said he gave the benefit of the doubt and read the second book in the series and it was written just as poorly. Oh well, I'll have to move on and and search for a decent Christian writer. If anyone can recommend a better Christian series, please let me know."
4,A Christian Indiana Jones Adventure,"Having thought the Left Behind series was a little overdone and drug out too long with very archtypical characters, I was a bit hesitant to read Babylon Rising. However, I found myself quite surprised at how enjoyable the book was to read. The characterization seemed more real, and the plot did not get bogged down at all.This book, and hopefully a series of books, will provide good adventure with a mix of Bible teaching. No, they aren't going to be deep works of fiction, but still very enjoyable to read. To me, it was like Indiana Jones, but with a Christian twist!"
3,I've seen better cartoons,"I've seen better cartoons, and these are not them. I dont remember these cartoons being this boring. Dont get me wrong, there OK, but...Bugs Bunny has nothing to worry about"
3,Helpful with its possitive affirmations.,"I enjoyed and relaxed with this CD but thought that the music and narrator competed with each other - it's hard to concentrate sometimes.Overall, I think it's good and the affirmations are very encouraging."
1,IT WAS EXTREAMLY DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO THIS CD AS THE MUSIC,"COMPETED SO MUCH WITH THE SPOKEN WORD. I wouldn't be able to reccomend this for bed time at all as you have to listen SO hard to hear the words that it becomes very ""unrelaxing"". However if you chose to listen to this during the day this would probably work for you."
2,"Great fence, horrible plate","As others here have said, the fence is great, but the plate is horrible, especially when considering the high-precision purpose of the fence. I've spent the last few hours trying to mount my router to the plate, but now have concluded that the plate must be replaced, if any precision work is to be done on it.As far as I know, this fence is the only game in town for precision adjustment, short of spending about LOT more for the Incra precision-adjustable model. And so for now, it's worth spending the extra time and money to make it work right."
3,Now with aluminum insert plate?,"First let me say that I do not own this router table, but I am thinking of buying one.I too was drawn to the precision adjust fences, but turned off by the bad reviews given the plastic insert. My local LOWES has one of these on display, and it has the same black plastic insert. However there were some others still in the box that stated that they now had an ALUMINUM insert plate. All these have vanished off the shelf during the Holiday sales season.I am wondering if anyone else has recently purchased one of these and found the improved aluminum insert, and if so, how does it perform??? I am going to be hanging a Porter-Cable 694VK on mine."
1,Run Away.,"The product needs help. Now, I need help. I am on my third freud table in a month. Today makes three separate occasions at the job site with the system down..... There is a problem with quality control. Broken parts, misalignment, and plate deflection, as if these factors were imprortant. What more could a professional wood worker want? One bright star for the fence. Buy the fence and put it on a competitor's table"
1,Cracked Plate,"The insert is junk it cracked and it sags wich means the material sticks when pusing through , not a good thing! I do like the dual adujustable fences, makes setting one proud of the other a breeze. BUT"
1,Not recommended,"I ignored the reviews of this table and purchased it for my buisness because I liked the fence.This insert for this table is of horrible design. I broke one during assembly, it just cracked in half when I was lowering it into the table. I called freud and they sent me out another. This time the corner of the insert cracked as I was tightening it to the table. I contacted Freud again and spoke with Troy who said they were out of stock for three weeks.If you purchase this table you need to budget another 50 dollars for an aftermarket insert from another company (like rockler).I do not recommend this table."
1,Poor Design,"I would not recommend this table. The insert did not come predrilled for any router even the Freud 2 1/4hp which I bought as a package deal with the table. The isert is very soft and sags with the weight of the router, which cause material to catch on the outfeed. The fence does not have a means to attcah finger boards. The miter fence track was to big for any of my miter fences, to much slop to be effective. Because of the insert issue with larger bits there is to much vibration and cause chatter mark on the material."
2,young vet carpenter,I am a young carpenter but I have been doing this kind of work since I was a child. My father owned a construction business so I didn't have summer vacation. I built houses. Now I own the business and 10's of thousands of dollars in the best tools. I have had this table for 1.5 years and it is a horrible thing for precision. I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought one. Everything written about this thing is true. The fence is nice but thats it. You have to take the thing apart to change bits. The table sags real bad and is hard to drill out for your router. I had to use my drill press to do it and counter sink the screws as well. You have to take it apart to store it or it will not fold up and the laminate fence pieces are curved. I just use it now with a cheap router to do stuff that doesn't matter much.
4,Pretty good stuff,"This a really good album. I'll make my praise for it quick. Everyone on this album are talented musicians. Most noteworthy of them all is the singer(Is his name Brandon?) He ads extra depth to the songs and his voice is one of the best i have heard. The drummer moves like crazy on the drums, and the guitars are pretty good(no break out solos,though) The bassist has some cool parts in the songs too. Get this CD, it will be worth it, trust me. I can't wait untill their next album, i fully expect for it to blow me away."
3,Ok cd,Wish more singing less elmo. To much elmo. Some good songs on here. Far-less. Good band. More into rock than elmo.
4,A realistic look from academians...,"This book consists of several different essays, each focusing on what the authors' feel is wrong in the field of sociology. From the lack of students in undergraduate programs to incoherence of work being done in the discipline, the writers' discuss the problems which workers' in the field face daily. Looking at both the academic world and sociology's place in social science research, editor Stephen Cole provides a wide range of critiques of the direction in which sociology is headed (or lack thereof)."
5,A Knockout Debut!,"If my review prompts just one person to check out this new series, I will be happy indeed. In this first book, Irene Kelly goes back to her old job as reporter after the bombing murder of O'Connor, her best friend and former mentor at the newspaper. It seems that O'Connor had been about to make a breakthrough on a thirty-five year old case of an unidentified murder victim. The victim was a young, pregnant woman. Her hands and feet had been cut off and her face smashed to prevent identification. When Irene and Frank Harriman of the Las Piernas police become involved in the case, bodies start piling up too fast to keep count. Ms Burke's theme seems to be that past misdeeds will always come back to haunt us. This is a theme that also echoes through her work in later books. If you're a mystery fan, you definitely should check out this new series. It's well written, with fine character development, and intelligent plotting. I highly recommend it."
5,A knockout thriller!,"It's getting a bit difficult for me to find new mystery writers that write well as well as spin good plots and do a good job on character development. I guess I read too much too fast. Anyway, I think I read this in two nights. Considering I work, and I am finishing my doctorate...I think that is a good indication of how much I enjoyed Burke's tale. Plan on reading more in the near future of hers....."
3,"Good, not great","The book is not bad, but a little cliche at times. Irene Kelly is a former newspaper reporter, who takes up the job again when her long time friend and fellow reporter, O'Connor is blown up by a letterbomb. She begins investigating the decades old unsolved homicide that O'Connor was obsessed with, thinking there may be some link to his murder. Irene's ex lover Frank is a homicide cop, and they reconnect over the case. The latter half of the book I spent groaning over the fact that if Irene and the cops would compare notes a little more frequently she would not land in such hot water, and be blindsided by some of the information.I like this book overall, it did not knock my socks off, but I have slogged through MUCH worse fiction."
4,"A fast, fun read","I found the book to be fast paced and highly entertaining. I picked it up for casual reading but it became a one-sitting read that had me up late because I just couldn't put it down. From the opening chapter of the book, the plot does not stop barreling ahead(although in a movie-ish bang 'em up and shoot 'em out kind of way). The ending also has the obligatory twist that I normally expect, but just didn't see coming in this book. Hard core mystery fans may not find it meaty enough, but I found it a great quick read and I'll definitely read the rest of the series."
3,Worth reading - not overly impressed,"This book was definately worth the time and money it took to read it, but I was not overly impressed. I have been worn out on all the typical mysteries - so I thought I would spend some time getting to know Irene. I did like the character and plan to read the next books in the series. Irene was well rounded and well written. If you're bored and need a new start - try this series out. It was enjoyable - just not breathtaking."
2,Confusion! Poor Editing,"Horrible - the beginning of Chapter 2 is a prime example of confusion both textually and graphically. Defintately would NOT recommend unless you already know the stuff well enough to overcome the above limitations! But then, what's the point of buying?"
5,good movie,I really enjoyed the movie but still haven't figured out why it was so expensive. I bought a used one because the price of a new one was just stupid.
5,Outstanding read!,I've been a fan since the World of Normal Boys and I found this novel to be superb at blending a time and place in gay legacy/history of SFO with the present day homosexual experience. Karl is an exceptional author and has the ability to successfully deliver enjoyable entertainment. I left the book eager to read his next. BRAVO!
3,"""Out of Season"" vs. ""It's in the Water""","Although both are small, independent films about the gradual development of intimate relationships between two women, ""Out of Season"" is a MUCH better film than ""It's in the Water"" (though not as good as ""Chutney Popcorn""). Deciding precisely why this is so would be an interesting exercise for aspiring movie critics. The ""Out of Season"" DVD itself, which offers full-screen format, is quite satisfactory."
3,Touching drama,I was a little skeptical because I'd never heard of any of the actors in this movie but I'm glad I gave it a chance. This is an offbeat drama that offers many funny and touching moments. The story is a little slow but and easy to follow. The scenery on the Jersey Shore is beautiful and creates a peaceful mood for this love story. Dennis Fecteau gives a touching performance as Micki's terminally ill uncle. This is one the better lesbian films I have seen in a while.
3,A Lesbian Romance,"Though the lighting and overall atmospheric quality in the movie lack a certain quality, Joy Kelly comes forward as an actor with an amazing amount of class. Her portrayal of Roberta holds a ring of truth to a quiet woman who truly knows her sexuality without the flamboyance of some of the other characters. This is an actor who deserves many more expansive roles. The other characters seem much more like caricatures. It carries a fairly simple romance plot which could have been delved into deeper and some of the characters more explored. I believe if the quality of the lighting and filming was stronger this would stand as a a fine gay film. As it stands it will be a fine television film."
2,Blah,I bought this because the back cover stated that the end love scene was too die for or something to that effect. Now you can read the other viewers' comments to find out what the story is about. But this movie only kept my attention because it was a lesbian flick. And i watch it whenever i get tired of all the straight people on television. the story line was poor and the action was bad. for once i want to see a lesbian film with substance. just another low budget bad acting lesbian film you can add to the list.
4,Long for what it is.,Good ideas in a wordy format. A bit new agey for me suggesting marriage as the ultimate single point of life rather than pursuing God or self.
3,Great for a coach,I thought this book was great for coaching athletes and putting together specific groupings of exercises to work on specific skills. The challenge though was that I bought it for myself and thought it would help me design something to help my triathlon speed. I'm thinking it requires a higher degree of background knowledge than I have at this point.
4,GOOD DANCE SONG,"hey, I go to this one camp twice a year and every night there are dances. They play this song and everybody there knows the same dance to it, so we all get in circles and do an awesome dance. The song is awesome and you can try to make up different dances to it, its really easy cuz its a great dance song! i would highly recomend it, so i think if you are thinking of buying a dance CD this is the CD to buy!!!!!"
5,Dick Raymond does it again!,"This is a great companion to Dick's other fabulous gardening book ""The Joy of Gardening"". I always thought the ""JOG"" was the best gardening book ever. This book, Gardening Year, establishes the time table necessary to achieve your desired results.Buy them both!"
2,"Absolutely nothing new, but has some good points...","If you can stand tha annoying habit of using double kick drums all along the songs, you will find that this band is some of the beste of the European power metal bands. Tobias Sammet is a really gifted singer.The problem is that the album has absolutely no innovation (so what? AC/DC also does not, but sells by the millions!)"
3,Very basic refresher on financial analysis,"This book is a very quick refresher course on some but not all of the most basic elements of financial analysis. It covers understanding financial statements, ratio analysis, elementary forecasting, and budgeting.Overall, this can be a useful and quick read just to remind you of some of the building block of financial analysis. It is certainly not in-depth or comprehensive, but it covers a couple key areas quickly and efficiently."
1,Great photos but light on facts,"This book tries, I think, to do too much. There are ""reviews"" of 200+ cities from around the world, with short blurbs and quotes on each, plus a selection of photos. It does read like a lengthy postcard from your pal who's passing through each city; the words read well, but they're just not all true. A couple of examples: New Orleans' French Quarter was pretty much untouched by Katrina (the writers say the hurricane destroyed the Quarter), and Houston has an Astrodome and a Reliant Stadium, but there's not a single facility called the Reliant Astrodome. The photos are gorgeous, and there are places ""off the beaten track"" included. Just don't use this as a single source for your travel information!"
2,Waste of Time,"If you enjoy reading the fine print on contracts, then this book is for you! The print is not only tiny, but faint. They tried to save ink by making the letters skinny, small, and grey (not even black). It's like torture on the eyes.The writing is pedestrian and silly, and city descriptions often waste time on cutesy trivia. Which there really isn't time for when you're trying to describe New York City on two small pages, half of which is plastered with a giant photo.And why 2 pages for each city? Some cities require more than 2 small pages. Why should, say, London or Moscow, get alloted the same 2 measily pages as some backwater town? Why? What's the reasoning? Just to have a rule and stick to it? Nonsense.Bottom line: Just a very ill-conceived book. Almost pointless. If you're going write a book about cities, DO IT RIGHT! Or at least do it not THIS wrong."
1,Very disappointing,"I must say I had high hopes when I saw this book on amazon. Sad to say it is truly a waste of money. Either that or I just do not get what the writers were aiming for. There are 500+ pages and each city is given 2 pages to be discussed with only one or two huge pictures (read 'wasted space') to entice the traveler's senses. There isn't a top ten sights to visit or any mention of secrets of the city (to intrigue) or short interesting facts about the city or internet links to find further info. I can't help it I am a guy, I like facts and I like to be visualy stimulated.Instead of those 1 to 3 huge pictures they could have placed an array of pictures. Even with the 2 pages they assigned to every city they could have done a lot more . I read about a few cities that I have been to and I find they were misrepresented.Do yourself a huge favor by not purchasing this book. The information is not worth the life of a tree.A word to the writers and publishers: Recycle the book and try again."
1,JUNK,DO NOT BUY THIS! THIS THING IS MADE WITH CHEAP PLASTIC. IT BROKE DURING THE ASSEMBLY PROCESS USING ONLY MODERATE PRESSURE.
3,Great for individual or group study...,"One of the most successful groups in the new Christian pop genre, Point of Grace, has a string of number one hits based upon the teachings of the Bible. Taking their most popular songs, each member shares some insight into how those verses came to be and what they have meant to the band. Their stories are filled with hope, miracles, and wisdom. These young women have used their God given talents in a remarkable way to reach thousands in one form of the media, and now they extend that same love to another.*** Keep the Candle Burning is a book that is ideal for either individual or group study. Each section ends in a space for notes as one charts their own spiritual growth. It might be a good text for a group of mixed age women, as the words are timeless and can reach both ends of the age spectrum. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
3,An good album!,"The reasion I bought this album was to hear Alexi Laiho's guitarplaying outside CoB. I'm a grat Children Of Bodom fan and love Alexi's playing. I will agree that Kimberly is one of metal's best female vocals. This album got some good songs, like ""I Spit On Your Grave"", ""The Sin Trade"" and ""Written In stone"". But that's it. The rest of the album is not as good as I had hoped for. Alexi playes great, but he is much better in CoB."
1,Vacuum pumps can only DAMAGE YOUR !,"Since 1996 when the book is written there is A LOT of new information which you can read on all web sites for penis enlargement. The use of pumps is exposed from long time as a SURE WAY TO PERMANENTLY DAMAGE YOUR [...]! If this is what you are looking for, go ahead and buy this book."
2,Should have been better,"I expected an exciting, informative book full of interesting anecdotes, but was disappointed. The beginning is simply boring, and the end is a superficial criticism of the current state of corruption in Brazilian football. The only chapter I found entertaining was on the life of Garrincha."
4,Great Read,"When I purchased this book I believed that it would be more about the tactics of the ""Brasilian"" game. Instead this book explored the cultural aspect the game has on Brasilian society and vice - versa. Don't expect this book to go into the science behind ""jogo bonito"" (beautiful game), instead appreciate it for digging deep to understand the global obsession with the Brasilian game and those yellow jerseys."
2,Uninspiring and Ineffective,"Robert Province’s “Patton's One-Minute Messages: Tactical Leadership Skills for Business Managers” is an interesting concept, but I found the book uninspiring and ineffective.The concept is simple: Province takes a one-sentence quote from Patton, then expands it to apply Patton’s principle to the corporate world. Province intends the reader to read one passage per day and reflect on it, almost like a devotional. But the “one-minute messages” are Province’s writings, not Patton’s. Province confusingly writes about commanders and soldiers in his messages, but tells the reader how to interpret and apply these lessons to managers and employees. I did not find this method very inspiration or informative."
1,READ AXELROD. This book is terrible in comparison,"If you read the Axelrod book on Patton it relates to management much better than this attempt. For a man who worships Patton like Province, the connection to business should have been easy, but he was not objective. And relating Patton to Deming? Ridiculous."
3,knowlege of true history,"The statementes of Gen Patton are true ones, fruit of experience and previous study of history.Real life not fantasy."
2,Where's Genesis?,"Where's the rest of the Bible? This has no Table of Contents, No Genesis. The earlier version was much better! Since I've ordered this for a friend of mine (she saw mine and really liked it) now I'm STUCK with a Bible that's missing stuff!"
3,Holy Bible English Version for the Deaf,"The Bible was beautiful. However, it's a very thick paperback book. The binding of the book did not hold up well after a couple of readings. Needs to really find another way to bind up this book to hold up under normal reading."
1,An unhappy customer's review!,"I got this POS when I bought my new 80GB Ipod Classic, the guy who sold it to me said ""I got a cheap one for ya, not that it is bad"". To begin it does't include a belt clip, just a stupid armband. Who works-out with his HDD Ipod, anyway? To my surprise the cheap rubbery material feels even cheaper than the money they ask and stretches like crazy wich made it impossible for me to adapt the belt clip from my Sansa's cover.And on top of that this mockery covers the click-wheel completely. Yes! You have to take your Ipod out, EVERYTIME you wish to use the click-wheel. At first I thougt that it would work through the layer of cheap rubber, but no. I had to mutilate the piece of trash to expose the click-wheel and spare me the stress of going back to the store and demanding my $10 bucks back."
2,Protects iPod but you can't turn the control dial,"This is a nice snug protector which is useful if you're working out, but you have to keep it on the same playlist and can't adjust the volume when it's on as the skin is so tight around the control dial."
2,Ehhh.,"The rubbery material is very sticky. It's not very pleasant to touch, and every time I pull it out of my purse, it's covered with fuzz. Yuck."
2,It's a heavy flashlight...,"We had purchased this toy for our son when he was younger. The reality is this... it lights up just a bit and it has two little toys at the end that a child could teeth with. The downfall of it all is that it is too heavy for a child to carry if they are in the everything in their mouths stage. Pretty boring, heavy and he doesn't touch it.Stay away unless you child shows a true interest at the toy store."
2,It's okay,"It's an okay toy, but the lights inside aren't very bright and are dulled by the frosted cover. I would not buy this product again."
4,"great for ""quiet times""","We love this toy because it doesn't make loud noise, but keeps my son's interest (from 5mo., to over a year now and still interested). Its great to take to church, resteraunts, etc..."
4,fun toy,"This toy lives in the pack n play my 8 mo old grandson sleeps in when he is here. He plays with it until he falls asleep and when he wakes up for a bit, it serves it's purpose. Like all toys it gets used only briefly when he is out and about, but when trapped in a play pen he finds it quite interesting."
1,Incomplete information,"This is not what had intended to order. This is a book made of photocopies of an original book that is kept at the univ of michigan library. It includes handwritten notes, some pages are upside down, it is in outdated typewriter text. It even states it may incude errors. None of this information is provided to the consumer. The correct book to buy (I assume) is the new version Relationships of Remedies AND Sides of the bodyRelationship of Remedies. I hope this is the one. If you want a historical looking book this is the one for you. The other book mentioned above is the user friendsly version!"
5,Superb storytelling; fascinating speculation,"What a fascinating read! Compelling, ambitous and intelligent. The handling of multiple storylines is deftly handled, and the thought provoking issues raised make this story one of the best reads in a long time. Evolution, gender, society and survial are explored in parallel but intertwining stories -- one human, one alien. Highly Recommended."
2,Dark Water's Embrace,"Although the book is an award winner, reading it is like wading through wet cement.As for the purchase and delivery from Amazon, there were no problems whatsoever."
1,Poor quality,Poor quality sound. It's as if it were not studio recordings but highly compressed MP3 files copied to the CD.
1,Not What I expected.,"The book has pale pictures, less information about watch models than many other books.one Review above says ""Most of the major luxury brands are represented providing companies' background histories""Well, this is absolutely UN-TRUE, at least was not true in Volume 4 (Which I bought).Not a word about the watch's companies or histories or anything, just bad photos and short descriptions that will give you information no more than that of it's maker advertisement."
1,Not what I expected,"Ordered the product online and it wasn't what I expected. The fabric is close to that of a thin, cheap towel and more challenging to install than I thought."
5,"amazing, inspiring!",This book is a gem and one you will read over and over again. Draw close to God to seek His will.
4,Experiencing Prayer with Jesus : The Power of His Preence & Examples,This book is a good learning tool help a personbuild christian values and principals. It has many greatideas to build your christian faith
3,Disappointing,"I've read other books by members of the Blackaby family (most notably, ""Experiencing God,"" which is excellent) and generally been impressed with them.This book, overall, was a disappointment to me. It didn't have the depth that I was hoping for from them on such a potentially expansive subject. I'll admit my expectations were high, but, still, there wasn't a lot to challenge.This rating would have been lower, but there was one point in the book (on urgency) that did strike me particularly hard, so I'll give them points for that."
3,I should have known better,"I had never heard of this group until I heard them on Pandora. I thought, ""wow, who are these guys?"" I did a little research and reasoned the best album to initiate myself what is commonly considered their ""greatest hits"". It's not awful. It's more background ""mood"" music, that you'll be listening to alone as it'd be a rare woman who'd not whine; urging you to put in a different CD. Definitely not something you're going to sing along to."
5,I would recommend it to anyone...,"I am still working on building a collection of Gospel/Christian music. This group (Blind Boys of Alabama) sings with soul and feeling, in a manner that seems to really touch upon the African American experience. It is very inspiring and I would recommend it to anyone, Christian or not, simply for it's historical, cultural and musical value.Other Gospel/Christian music used for comparison: Mahalia Jackson; Elvis Presley; Jim Nabors; Shirley Ceasar"
5,Great Music,I've had this in my car CD player since I got it two weeks ago. It's the most amazing music!
5,Stealthy Thriller,"Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is one of the most fun games I've ever played. It is by far in the top end of the Splinter Cell series, although the first two were really good. I love the option to either knock out, or kill your opponent when you grab them from behind. I like sneaking up on enemies, and then just leaving them out cold. The graphics are insane and really build up an atmosphere of creepiness. The settings are all well done, with lots of detail and sensory information. It makes you feel like a ghost. Never seen, but felt right before the subject is knocked out. Good, clean fun."
5,for all young americans who wish to succeed abroad,"easily consulted, gives a full world coverage some 3,000 entries concerning higher education opportunities in 120 countries from Argentina to Zimbabwe."
2,Good.,This book is good for the collection. Two stars solely because there are newer books in the series that are superior.
5,A Must Have!!!,"To narrow it down within the Rock genre. More post punk-alternative with usual blend of Jeffery Lee style.This album is brilliant. Jeffery's vocals are his unwavering best. You still get that honest, unvarnished GC sound, mixed in with a small bit of Robing Guthrie, production flair. Raw. Yet tasty! One doesn't over take the other. The balance works awesomely!!!So glad Henry Rollin's revived this jewel!!! Thank you, Rollin's!"
1,Not a good buy,"I am frankly disappointed by the bookThought processes & concepts are presentedin bits and pieces instead of logicalthought trains, some areas discussion notup to date & not in state-of-the-art mannerMany regrets haveing effected this buy"
4,Very Unique,"I bought this CD mostly for sentimental value. 2 of the songs were actually playing on Swiss radio while I lived there. The music genre is best described as synthesized techno/dance. However the songs are all very uniquely blended with themes. There's a Swiss yodeling song, and Muh! is the ambience of being on a dairy, etc. There are some satirical tales of the Swiss bankers, or gnomes of Zurich. It's a fun collection- but only for a developed taste. Not everyone will enjoy this."
4,good foot tapping hard garage rock sounds,This album rules! Most of the guitar riffs are catchy and they never try to make the riffs do more. This is plain and simple a good garage rock album that does not scream and wail to the point of nauseum. Get this one if you can
3,If you like this sort of thing...,"The other reviewers pretty much hit the nail on the head, I suppose this CD really just isn't my style. I really just bought it because it was the coolest looking CD I'd seen in a while, the outside of the case was wraped up like the old packs of baseball cards, I thought that in its self was worth my 10 bucks."
3,pretty solid rock action.,"For some reason the suits in the music industry decided that The D4 were THE band of the moment and decided to really put the push on. For once the industry squares picked a half-decent band to hype to death. The D4 kick out some back to basic jams and have a fairly good vision of what modern garage-rock'n'roll should be! The D4 easily blow the White Stripes away and put most of the "" new "" garage dorks to shame. All of that said, there isn't anything new here as lots of bands have done this stuff better and with more soul and conviction. Still, this is a fairly good rock'n'roll record. Oh, well, what can you do?"
4,punk is back,"This CD by D4 is by far the best punk record to come out in ages.They put the vines, the hives, the strokes and especially Sum 41 and blink 182 to shame. D4 are punk at heart, and play it with a vengeance. Do not miss this CD, go out and find it and play it loud"
4,Pretty fun,"If you want an album with challenging lyrics you can really contemplate over, look elsewhere. This album is just plain, simple, crunchy, old school rock and roll in the vein of AC/DC, and it never aspires to be anything else. The album is full of catchy hooks and simplistic power chords that lodge themselves in your memory, and this is the perfect type of music to listen to if you want to turn your brain off for awhile. Standout tracks include ""Rock and Roll Mofo"" and ""Get Loose."""
2,"Bland, Boring Bluff","The music on this CD is way too generic, and the songwriting comes off as very bland. Very repetitive. I thought it was cool that they covered Guitar Wolf and Johnny Thunders, but even having the right influences don't necessarily make for a great band. I thought the production didn't have that necessary OOMPH in it either - it's bland and boring."
3,"good, not memorable","Now that the rock renaissance which began during the summer of 2001 is showing signs it's ready to fizzle out, it might be a good time to consider the impact these bands will have on music as whole. Unfortunately, most of these garage/revival groups won't have much of an impact or career in the coming years, the exception being The White Stripes, The Strokes and possibly a few others.The D4 is one of the bands who will disappear in the next couple of years. They hopped on the bandwagon a little too late and their sound is too generic for the genre. Plus they're from New Zealand which puts them quite a ways from the rest of the rock scene in the U.S. and U.K.It's sort of a shame really since their nose to the grindstone music is entertaining. Although you won't get anything besides entertainment out of the otherwise pointless songs.If nothing else, 6 Twenty will be a decent album to blare out of my car while i'm driving with the windows down."
1,One of the worst,"If you like one word choruses this CD is for you. Personally I think this is horrible, it is so repetitive and just feels like these guys sat around and wrote every song in about 5 minutes. If you want music that is good and sort of like this try listening to The Vines. Thank You. Frankenstein is still at the mart."
2,Pretty but non-functional,"These are very pretty, I bought them to use as nice everyday and also occasionaly for special, also purchased them because they had no silver to tarnish, however the holes for the pepper were so small nothing would come out, the salt was better but not by much. I was using finely ground pepper and stuck a toothpick into the hole to make sure they were not blocked by an invisible plastic but they were open. Pretty but can't use."
3,Miller Rogaska salt and pepper shaker,"Looks really good, nice and heavy and well balanced but holes for salt and pepper seem to be a little on the smaller size, flow is really slow. Be ready to do a lot of shaking."
5,It's all about the choices we make,"Og Mandino has done it again with a simple to read book, yet a great story to tell! Very powerful and thought provoking! I highly recommend it!"
3,very inspirational but also predictable,"I read this book after I had seen some interesting passages of it handwritten in a friends ""reflections"" notebook.It did not disapoint me because it was a very inspirational and offered many suggestions dealing with analysing my life and getting my goals and priorities straight; on the other hand it was very predictable.At one point in the book main character is faced with a decision he has to make: his son will die in two months unless he is willing to give up his own life in order for his son to live.Like anyone would actually have to think about this one, especially if you are a parent!"
2,Not Inspirational,This book claims it has a surprisingly new message of hope...it doesn't. Its about Og and how he left his job to write a book...
5,"devastatingly honest and eye opening,",Og has put forth his extremely brilliant talents and created a masterpiece that changed my life!
1,Am I supposed to be inspired?,"For fiction, it's too convenient; for an inspirational book, it's too fantastic. The ""choice"" turned out to be more science fiction than realistic. A dead guy - another once-upon-a-time inspirational author - presents the main character with ""the"" choice. I read more than a hundred pages of a guy's life only to find out that he'd be into a fashion dilemma later: a red tie or a less garish one? This is supposedly a ""religion and inspiration"" book, right, so did Mr. Mandino really think we'd hold our breath, fearing that his main character would say, ""Ah, f*** it! Son or no son, a red tie is just too ostentatious for the occasion""?"
5,inspiring book,The book is one of the most inspiring books i have ever read. I also liked An Encounter With A Prophet and Conversations with God
4,intrigue,Look at political upheaval in Greece during 1960s helps to explain the current turmoil there. The list of things ultimately banned (including the Beatles) that runs during the credits is a perfect letdown to the nonstop tension.
2,Let's set the record straight.,"The ""experts"" commenting here advise avoiding the English ""DUBBED"" version.The ENGLISH VERSION was filmed in parallel with the french version (The use of french was necessitated to have it distributed in Europe as the original Greek would have limited draw.) The incident took place here in Thessaloniki Greece, where I live).All the performers were fluent in English and you can recognize their voices.It was not ""Dubbed"" (watch their lips ""expert"").Now those of you who know where the original English language version can be found, speak up.It is an excellent film and deserves to be experienced. (Read the book.)"
3,Flat plug,"The flat plug is great, but our outlets are upside down, so the cord goes up and around, not straight down. That is a bit of a pain, but I should have checked that before I ordered."
5,I want to hug my wall hugger! lol,The outlet has a generous length and fits perfectly flush up against the wall! Even the cable is flay! It has 3 outlets on it for plenty of connections. Thumbs up! I bought 2!
5,Good product,Very good product and solves many problems when running multiple cords and do not have to run a power board. Wish they were made in 240volt as I would buy plenty.
4,ok,I would give this more stars but the wall plug end is fixed and they don't tell you that before you get it. I needed this to down along a baseboard to behind the bed so I could plug in two lamps. It works but the end is pointed in the wrong direction so there is now a potential tripping hazard with a partial coil of cord right at the plug.
4,good product - very compact,the plug is oriented left when plugged into the wall. i wish they also had a wall plug that faces right.
5,Perfect!,These were probably the best extension cords I have found. Thick and durable and I can use the outlet behind my bookshelf!
3,Works as advertised but angle on plug makes it a problem,"This cords works as advertised but has one problem. The plug (which is flat to wall) is angled. Because of this it is hard to plug two items into same wall outlet. If the second item has a standard plug, it is not going to be a problem but a wall charger or two of these might not work in same outlet. I think they made it come off at an angle so the cord would fall straight to the floor but it makes for a problem at outlet."
2,Left or Right?,"I only have one problem which applies to most ALL these type cords from Amazon... When you plug it in, they should make it VERY CLEAR if it goes to the LEFT of the outlet or the RIGHT!I bought two of these (one 6 foot, one 12) and both went to the LEFT.That worked for the 12 foot, but I needed the other one to go to the right!I looked at more of these with the search box, NONE made it clear which direction they would go.Yeah, I should have looked closer at a larger picture, but it also SHOULD be in the specs!The quality is VERY good, but it looks ugly (and stupid) as the wall outlet is in a VERY visable location"
4,The High Renaissance And You Are There,"This is an extraordinary book, on many levels. It is a concise abridgement of a much longer work and a fine, readable translation of the original 16th century Italian. More importantly, the substance is priceless. This is nothing less than a guided tour of the amazing events of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, from a clear-eyed, surprisingly objective reporter who knows whereof he speaks. Guicciardini was, among other things, Machiavelli's assistant and an adviser to popes. Writing from the vantage point of his personal observation of the events of his lifetime, he discusses: the Medici, the building of the dome of St. Peter's for the jubilee of 1500, the related sale of indulgences, the ensuing ""Lutheran heresy,"" the discovery of the new world, Henry VIII's divorce and the ensuing separation of the Church of England, and the arrival of syphillis in Europe, among other topics. Be warned that it is dense material, but it is worth the effort."
4,The Shaman Speaks,"If any written word can shake corporate America's middle management from its ""do it the way it's always been done"" stupor, ""Winning the Talent Wars"" is that word.Tulgan recognizes the intertwined realities of a new workforce psyche, the technology-driven acceleration of information flow and the intense competition for knowledge resources. Unlike other authors attempting to demystify this subject, Tulgan is not content with a colorful analysis of these forces. He offers a host of innovative ""rubber meets the road"" techniques that can be applied almost immediately with little or no cost. Tulgan's book is a recipe for change, but the ingredient list within may be too tough for some middle managers to stomach. If you want to be a new economy chef, internalize this book. If you are a burger-flipper, don't even bother."
3,Useful for a general overview of more recent HR practices,"The book vividly described the fundamental shift in employer-employee relationship in new economy. This is not something new by now, and concepts like performance-based rewards, knowledge management have been talked a lot already.But if you did not pay much attention at human resource (HR) matters before, and want to have a general overview of recent HR concepts and practices, this book shall still help you. There are also interesting debates like instrinic vs. extrinsic values.As an employee, this book can help you to understand better the background of some HR policies. For example, you may understand and get convinced why managers are more accommodating to ""talents"" demands. It can convince you to be more realistic about the old career ladder modelThere are plenty of companies examples."
5,Best Beatles Book!,"For anyone interested in Beatles' music , this is THE book.The author is amazingly thorough in his research.The photos are beautiful.At the core , people's interest in the Beatles is about the music.This book perfectly and originally explains their history of instrumentation.No other book ever even attempted to do so."
4,Get your copy NOW!,"The Christmas present I never got--so I bought my own copy. This book meticulously covers a topic not widely known by a lot of people, even fans of the Fab Four. It's about time someone wrote a book on the instruments and equipment the Beatles used to craft their wonderful songs. The book is a must for a Beatlemaniac's library, those interested in rock music, modern musical instruments, and the recording arts. However, I wish the author could have hired better, more thorough proofreaders, as this edition had a few incorrect spellings (e.g., look for ""Geroge"" Harrison). In addition, I , too, would like a section that lists the gear they used on each album or song. Despite all this, it's a great read, but it could use a few more tweaks. Maybe the revised (2002) edition will do the trick?"
5,Just what I have been waiting for!,"As a lifetime Beatles fan and a amateur musician I have always wished for a definitive study of their instruments and equipment. This book is more then I hoped for. As another reviewer has stated, coupled with Recording Sessions, you have one of the most thorough studies of any artists at their craft ever done. This book is not just for musicians or techies either. It is one of the more interesting and accurate accounts of Beatlemania next to their own anthology. A far more interesting read then most of the ""quick for profit"" pulp that has come along over the years after the Beatles have had one of their many resurgences in popularity with each new generation."
5,great read for musicians,this does not dissappoint. the author knows his stuff and he dishes out the details that will satisfy a guitar lover.
5,BEATLES GEAR,Being a musician and a Beatles fan I have throughly enjoyed this book. It is very detailed and entertaining at the same time. Any fan that is a musician and is interested in their sound and how they acheaved it will enjoy this book.Handsome Al Heckle
5,I Want to hold your guitar,"I became a Beatles' fan on that 1st night of Ed Sullivan in February 1964. I was mesmerized by the music which became a driving force in my life-to this day. Naturally I had to pick up a guitar and try it for myself. Over the years I stared at pictures of the boys with their various pieces of equipment. As a musician and a fan I had to know every instrument they played. This book is a diehard Beatle fan's dream. In fact I wish that the book was longer. It tells the story of practically every instrument the boys played-what make/model, where it came from, what happened to it---you get the picture. Couple this book with Mark Lewisohn's Recording Sessions and you get an almost complete picture of the Beatles in the studio and on stage. As John said, ""Ya shoulda been there!"" Well, with this book, I am a little closer. Thank you, Andy.(P.S. I am writing this in the shadow of my Epiphone Casino, my Beatle bass, and my Fender Twin Reverb Amplifier.)"
3,More pictures please!,"The book is very informative, but from a big coffee-table book I expected a lot more photos and a lot less text!"
3,Interesting movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. It wasn't too overly violent, and it had a good plot. The acting was pretty good, Which is always an important factor. MiMi Rogers plays a wonderful roll of a prostitute who was badly beaten by a customer. Now the customer is out to ruin her life. Little did she know that he is a big name in her town, So not even the mob will help her."
5,Just what I needed,"This is what I needed so I wouldn't run out of battery when I was taping using my camcorder, Thanks!"
1,Not forth the Digital Rebel XT,"I'm not sure what camera this battery fits, but it's definately not the Digital Rebel XT."
2,batteries don't hold charge,"Perhaps I received bad batteries, but they don't hold their charge. I bought a few of them and they all are inferior in quality. I didn't address this with the company, so can't say that they wouldn't have fixed the problem, but I am not pleased with the purchase and won't buy again."
5,Great Battery!!,This battery is perfect. It holds the charge and stays charged for quite a while- I'm not exactly sure how many shots as it is one of two batteries in a grip for my 30d.
3,"JUST SO, SO. . .","(...) One of my complaints about Trust Me Once was there were just too many characters roaming around. Also a couple of the coincidences in the plot line were just too contrived. For those determined to purchase this book, I don't want to ruin the story by being more specific on that point. Maybe a tighter plot would have helped or a shorter story. ""Jan Coffey"" also writes as May McGoldrick and I recently read THE PROMISE. In my opinion a much better book."
2,waste of money,"I'm about halfway through this book, and trying to hurry through it so I can read something better. Characters' secrets are starting to come out. Too bad I don't care about any of these characters! Maybe I would if they had some depth, but they don't have much more than names. Before I started this book, I added another of Jan Coffey's books to my wish list. I deleted that book."
5,Saw Ron singing live on Finnish TV,Saw Ron singing live on Finnish TV and decided to find his album. He has a great voice!!!!
4,Fits the need,"Was looking for a good stake for our Scout Troop, these hold up to missed hits from a hammer that plastic one do not. Far beats the 4 pack price in most sporting goods stores."
3,"Bouncy fun in a jaded time, but there is no sweat in it","Dissing Taco is just mean. Even if it isn't your bag, Taco (along with his synthesizer-savvy sidekick, ""Gern"") sang beautifully, and not whimpily. His music was among the finest in the electronic pop explosion of the eighties - rich in texture, bouncy and humorous, and building a bridge to swing jazz so successfully that a Gershwin tune topped the pop charts!Where the music will fail some is in the extent that it is electronically programmed, including a lifeless drum beat. There is no sweat in this music. Backing up Taco's pure tenor voice, it may not be such a surprise why Taco did not find much of an audience in our edgy culture, despite the splash he made with ""Puttin' On The Ritz."""
4,PUTTIN' ON THE GLITZ!,"well, for someone who grew up in the 80's, this is the best album for the modernized versions of the old american songbook. when i first heard this in my teens, i thought this was the original version of puttin on the ritz. as i grew up, i learned that this was a remake of a very old, old song...ha ha ha...finally included in the album is the ""longer version"" (at 4:36) of the single which i truly adore. there are still other gems in this compilation, such as cheek to cheek, la vie en rose, you are my lucky star, among others...buy it: if you're a true taco fan and adores old fashioned music with a new twist!avoid it: if you have other taco compilations or simply do not like the type of taco's music.this is one of the rare gems of the 80's, alongside falco, milli vanilli, and other forgotten classic greats."
3,"Great Voice, Boring Drum Track","Pleased to find this in your catalog. Taco's voice has the right color for these songs. I'd remembered the album as a ""5"" but had forgotten about the constant throb of the synthetic drum. Still, good fun all and all."
2,Very average 80's music,Putting on the Ritz was tight back in the early 80's.but overall very chessy 80's music.sounds like a over hyped Wayne Newton Knockoff in hindsight.the music like much of the over synth 80's style&sound hasn't aged well.
4,A great Kerouac Sampler,"Though it has been a while since I have read this book, I found it distressing that there were no reviews of it in this area.I know very many of you love Kerouac's works and styles, so I hope that this book will be given it's due attention. Its contents are five short stories or sketches that move around the central theme of travel. A sketch about the ""railroad earth"" written in spontaneous style is quite riveting, and here you will have a chance to read what seems to be an early sketch of the fire tower section from ""Dharma Bums"".I hope these suggestions will have you picking up a copy of this wonderful book"
4,A tale of 2 halves,"i have just finished the book for the second time managing to hold together the now loose leafed pages of my 30 year old copy while trying to read most of the book outdoors.it just intrigues me that this book can be so devoid of true literal gems right through his railroad and seamen days as though a real working life just shuts out his natural reaction to his waking dream that he finds himself in. However after a fun but claustrophobic period back in his native and tireless New York the section of his isolation in the mountain shack really soars and this is where the beauty of his style, with references to the void and his own belief that he has the answers to its formeless form. You feel the strength of his journey and the honesty of his emotion and just know he is free enough to write at his best now.A wonderful book for dreamers."
3,"Spontaneous prose, spontaneous living","Jack's not for everyone but reading Lonesome Traveler I was teleported right into his shoes-- if you're familiar with Kerouac you know this is his style. His ""I"" is the one you're with but this ""I"" is really experiencing every moment-- the minor details of being a train brakeman for instance-- doesn't sound glamorous but it breathes life. It's a bit claustrophobic and frusturasting with his page long sentences but if you forget all the rules of writing and literature you'll surf through a day with him and it's real even if his stories aren't."
2,You have to be on speed!,"Jack Kerouac wrote most of his stories on drugs and this story is no different. Sadly, he's not on the good drugs like Hunter S. Thomas, he's more on the i need to start mopping the floor at 3 in the morning."
5,Fine product.,Never have had any problems taking this product.I usually put this powder in capsules.But when I get sick I mix it in diet soda a couple times a day and the cold doesn't last near as long as without using this product.(A week instead of weeks)At least that's what it seems.No nausea with this product either.That is good because a lot of things make me nauseous now days.
4,Liked the product,"We tried some of this and really liked it. It has a nice tart flavor, is easy to get down with water or applesauce (in our case), and never caused intestinal upset. I also liked the ingredient list and that it is a buffered type.I'm looking forward to trying this product in homemade gummy squares to make sweet/sour gummies."
2,An overview of Western to Northern European dress,"This book is filled with pictures. The problems I've found with it are (1) it does not seem consistant in its terms with other historical costume history books so it is difficult to compare with other sources. (2) The writer tends to make sweeping statements that are true only for England, such as saying that hose weren't knitted until the 16th century because knitting didn't reach England until than. (3) Other statements are very frustrating since the author will state that so and so was dressed in a Persian or Arabic style and then does not describe that style at all. On the good side the pictures are helpful and some of the statements agree with other souces."
4,Excellent overview,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, especially as I enjoy European history so much. It was full of interesting historical details and how fashion influences the world, and how the world influenced fashion (ex: architecture changed because of the skirt size). The one thing I would have liked to see more of was a discussion on Eastern Fashions. The book did a great job explaining how the West was influenced by the East, but had no stand alone history of the East. The authors are seamless, and as Laver's narration ends, the others pick it right up without the style of writing changing much."
3,but does it really glow?,"not so sure it does. i think i might have seen it kinda glowing. very cute, if your into pink :)"
4,Three fourths of a great book,"Raven Stole the Moon starts out a bit disjointed as the author tries to give some background to the fantasy element that the reader will face at the end of the book. After a rocky start the book takes you into a Holden Caufield-esque story of a middle aged woman who gets struck with wanderlust as she slowly goes crazy. I really enjoyed the middle of this book, you couldn't tell if the main character was crazy or if some of the events were actually happening how she thought they were. I feel like the author dropped the ball at the end though and instead just wrote a fantasy out so that he could wrap it up. I am tempted to recommend that you put down the book with 50 pages to go and instead dream about what might have happened to the ending of that great book."
5,Raven Stole the Moon,"I purchased the novel, strictly because I was captivated by the title. I loved the tale and would read it again, as well as recommend it."
4,A great book,"Somewhere between realistic fiction and supernatural...this book really lets you stay in the moment and then let yourself go. Just enjoy it for what it is. Garth Stein is just so awesome, keeps you interested from page 1."
5,Excellent!,"I chose this book because it was written by Garth Stein. I've read his others, the Art of Racing in the Rain, and How Evan Broke His Head, and thoroughly enjoyed them, so I figured ""why not?"" Once I started reading Raven, I could NOT put it down. it was incredible! captured my attention and wouldn't let it go until I was done. Like all of Garth Stein's novels, this is well-written and riveting."
4,Raven Stole the Moon,Another great book from Garth Stein--definitely a mystical theme and a learning experience of Native American culture.Great service from Amazon-as usual.
3,A Good First Effort...,"Certainly worthy of a few hours of reading....but not a great piece of literature by any means... HOWEVER, it paved the way for a magnificent next effort ""Art of Racing in the Rain"" which rates a 5 stars plus...in my opinion."
3,disapointed,not a fan of this book. loved his other 2 books but this one wasnt my kind of reading. u must read his other two books.
3,To many words to tell the story.,It was good until we got to the tunnels and then I lost interest. Parts were unbelievable.and too drawn out
1,I got tired of reading it,"I read this book based on how much I liked The Art of Racing in the Rain which I was unable to put down.This book got boring and repetitive. If I had to read the word ""kushtaka"" one more time I wanted to scream. Granted that this book was published many years ago and was his first book, but he just could not get me interested in the topic.At 3/4 of the way thru the book I skipped to the last chapter. Then I went back and completed the reading of the book. This book could be classified as ""chick-lit"" and I don't recommend it."
5,"Great sense of place, great story, couldn't quit reading","I'm really excited to see what this author does next. I loved his book ""The Art of Racing in the Rain"" and I loved this book too. Reading this you get a very strong sense of the pacific northwest, strong enough to get easily immersed in the book. The story is unique and the characters are nicely drafted. I wanted a different ending but I can't complain that the ending wasn't authentic."
5,Losing a Child,"Even though this book is a fiction I really found comfort in following the story about how this woman coped with the death of her child. Sometimes it is a very lonely process of grieving after losing a child. The fact that the author really got what mothers go through when a child dies helped me cope with the fact that losing a child is not a fiction in my life.Big thanks from the founder of Metaphysical Mothering,Robin Alexis"
1,"LOVED ""The Art of Racing in the Rain""-did not like ""Raven Stole the Moon"" at all",The writing seemed choppy and unconvincing in spots. I was ready to finish this and take it back to the Land of the Undead (or the library).
2,Unfulfilling,"Having so thoroughly enjoyed The Art of Racing in the Rain, I eagerly dove into this book. After finishing it, however, it seemed clear to me that Stein's first novel had only been re-released in order to capitalize on his subsequent novel's success. An OK story, fair characters, but ultimately a poor and disjointed ending made this an unfulfilling read for me."
5,I just love Garth Stein!,"I started with ""The Art of Racing in the Rain"", which lead me to this book and I'm online ordering ""How Evan Broke His Head..."" right now.He's a fantastic author who I think anyone can enjoy. And so far, from the two books of his I've read, he has this amazing way of ending his stories that leaves you wanting more, yet fully satisfied. I know that doesn't make sense, but read the book and you'll get it."
2,Send this book to the Moon or the trash.,"Now that I find that this was the author's first book, I'm amazed he got ""..Racing in the Rain"" published. I kept putting the book down thinking, how can the writing get any worse. I liked the idea of the Kushtaka, but other than that the characters are never developed and the writing is so poor, I am wondering if an editor even went through the book before it was published. It is nice to think that you can go from such a failure to such a wonderful book as ""Racing"" which I will keep to reread many times. The only reason I am giving it two stars instead of one is because the ""idea"" of the book was a good one."
4,"Kind of weird, but good stuff","These guys do a lot of Cha-cha-cha/guajira, I think about half the tracks use that rhythm. That slower rhythm appears to blend easier for them with the scottish sounds. Then on the salsa tracks they turn up the latin, and it works. ""El Sol de la Noche"" is their masterpiece, never have I heard a cha-cha-cha like this, that track sounds as as good as anything by the top salsa bands in New York and Cuba, only with Celtic instrumentation added.The musicality is good, but could have a little more variety in their rhythm section. While they understand the Cuban rhythms well, they don't play with them that much as the Cubans do, and it sounds repetitive at times, specially on the longer tracks."
2,A waste of a good opportunity,"This DVD left me extremely unimpressed.There is certainly stock footage of the usual suspects, but the presentation is dreadful. Paradoxically, the white commentator (Robert Palmer) appears extremely knowledgeable and to the point, while the black one (Albert Murray) just waffles and drones and says nothing much of interest at all.On top of this, a large chunk of the 85 minutes is taken up with Jazz. Now admittedly, Jazz is descended from the Blues, but there just isn't time for such a digression.Save your money.DISCLOSUREI received a free copy of this item for review."
3,This book is not a guide to publishers,"This book encourages young writers to write, but seems to discourage them from actually trying to get their work published, and does not give book publishers' contact information. It instead encourages children to send work to specific children-oriented magazines, which have little or no reward/monetary return involved. There is nothing wrong with this, but the title of the book is misleading. It was not very helpful to me, who hoped as a child (however unrealistically) to get his work published in book-form."
5,Scully jacket,The jacket fits and looks very good. I'm well pleased with my purchase of this jacket and I recommed it to others.Denny Weir
4,Pretty Good.,"There are very few french books for children it seems. However, we enjoy this one. It has both english and french (with pronunciation guide in the back of the book). The pictures are amusing. We wish there were more of these books."
4,Another Andrew LLoyd Webber masterpiece,"I originally bought this CD because I thought that Sarah Brightman was singing on it. I had seen a 'Song & Dance' TV performance that had Sarah in the title role. Although, I was initially disappointed that Sarah Brightman wasn't singing, I have since come to appreciate Marti Webb. I love the music and also the ironic humour in the lyrics. When I listen to the 'Dance' disc I always remember the wonder of Wayne Sleep's dancing in the TV performance. No one could top Wayne Sleep back then. I can (and do) listen to 'Song & Dance' over and over again"
4,Time Capsule...,"Vastly under rated Andrew Lloyd Webber show, albiet with inane lyrics by hack Don Black. Once in a while they work, but the performance by Marti Webb is a lot more real than Bernadette Peters Broadway performance. The show makes a bit more sense in this version, too. Now if only we could get the Sarah Brightman version on CD."
4,Sam's Story.,"While it was fun reading Sam's Story, there were several editing glitches with my downloaded Kindle copy. From locations 4563 to 4661, I had these numbers 258/260/264 followed by the words 'Maureen Child' imbedded into several paragraphs of this novel. This, nevertheless, definitely interrupted the flow of the story. St. Martin Press/ and Kindle need to rectify these errors."
1,Poorly written,Quite possibly the worst novel I've read. Very predictable. This isn't her first book. The writing shouldn't be so simplistic.
1,There may be better books about phising out there,"This book is poorly written, as a web professional I wanted to get more insight into this phenomenon but what I got was repetitive, shallow and obvious. Possibly, the technical aspects of phising do not deserve a book, but this is hardly a reason to spread 10 pages worth of content on 400 pages. The book I wanted to read was one with more emphasis on possible defense tactics and with further information on the people who engage in these activities.Furthermore, This book is dated, 6 years in the web industry is a long time. What I did enjoy is another book by the same publisherInside the SPAM Cartel: By Spammer-X"
4,A Surprisingly technical read.,"As a system's administrator for a medium sized company, I've seen my share of phishing emails. I've become so used to seeing them that I stopped paying much attention to them. I didn't see anything technical about people sending an email.Phishing Exposed is a look at the phishers themselves, their motives, their techniques. Bit by bit looks at new cross-user attacks, such as a new one (to me, anyway) called ""Response Splitting."" From malicious software using publically unknown flaws in software, even exploiting flaws in Voice over IP services to abuse the trust of their victims.The author steps the reader through the cycle of the phisher, and even shows high-profile sites guilty of e-mail tactics that make them prime targets for phishing attacks.I agree Security Professionals will take something from this book, but I recommend it largely to other Sysadmins, who might not consider the scope of this threat, which is becoming more and more a problem."
4,vastly underrated,"one of the most painfully underrated television series of its day. ""Dead Man's Curve"", starring Susan Anspach as a current writer who unwittingly opens old wounds when attending a high school reunion in her ancestral village, was an occasional grabber, albeit a problematic solver. Michael Ironside (""Scanners"", ""Total Recall""), also stars, once again displaying his knack for portraying insidious heavies. ""Night Shift"" is the best entry, starring Margot Kidder as a malevolent nurse who makes numerous attempts to snatch a patient's tangible ring. Thus, the patient runs amok. He fiendishly slays a cat, her and her boyfriend. He exhibits the predator what it's like to be the prey. ""The Last Scene"" was the weirdest entry, devoid of any genuine supernatural backround, starring Peter Coyote as a director who continuosly stives to get her actress in the right mood for a horror film."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Amazon should be embarrassed to sell this. It looks like someone did a ""Select All"" of a web site or pdf file and then copied and pasted it into a text file. It's basically unreadable. There's no formatting and many typographical errors. Numerous figures are referenced but none are included. It is a scam for Amazon to try to sell this.It's really too bad because the Earnest Jones method is fantastic and we need more instructional manuals on it. Go get the Earnest Jones book. DO NOT waste your time or money on this one."
2,Way too long...and drawn out,I started off liking it and then more than halfway through I just quit reading because I lost interest. This book is way too long and drawn out. I absolutely hated the main character Sienna and had no interest in what happened to her. The author could've killed her off halfway through and called it a day.
3,Easy read and a nice escape,I have a hard time completing a book but this one was pretty good. It allows you to escape in to the world of the rich and famous... and dysfunctional. It got a little boring in the middle but otherwise was fairly entertaining. There is a switch between character focus which was a bit choppy and the family in England didnt interest me much. The main character (the young glamourous up and coming actress) was what kept me reading. I recommend it for a lazy evening.
3,a good read,"This book by Bagshawe is a long book and it takes place mainly in Los Angeles and with the movie industry. It is a love story about a girl/young woman who was so adored and let do anything she became almost impossible. Her lover and she had a quarrel and the rest of the story is about other things for awhile. It is an interesting read and the characters are believable. The plot is kind of normal for a love story but the setting and magnitude of the novel make it a little different.It is a good read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Adored it,Ms. Bagshawe has provided those in a perpetual search for a dishy beach read...just that. I found myself carrying this book (which does have it's soft core moments) around with me until I finished the last sentence. A pure fluffy escapist dessert.
4,Wild Child DNA,"Adored is a family story of three generations - all gone astray on one level or another. Well written, rich characters, true to their personalities. Some unexpected twists and turns in the story of wealth, fame, and love hard won and easily lost. Love them or hate them, you come to understand their motivation and what brings them to make their life choices. If you enjoy behind-the-scenes with the rich and famous you will enjoy this book."
4,Great read from beginning to end,"I loved this book...the first Tilly Bagshawe novel I'd ever read. Her characters captured me and led me on a wonderful journey to the very end. It was hard to put down! After reading this novel by Bagshawe, I couldn't wait to read ""Showdown"" written by her as well. Boy, ""Showdown"" wasn't close to meeting my expectations!"
4,Entertaining,"At first I couldn't get into it but once I did I couldn't put it down. Although some of it was predictable, there were a few unexpected surprises. I loved that it was set around the Hollywood star life. There were people in the book to love and hate and even some of the hated characters had a good side to them at moments. Although the story entertwined around the main character Sienna McMahon, every character in the book had a small story going on and connected everything together. It was definitely entertaining."
1,"No style, no substance","In most books of this type, there is no substance, but there is --in addition to the requisite sex and shopping, a bit of style. There was no style, no flair, no charm to this book. The lack of characterization and the absurdity of famous family members constantly asking each other, ""But how did you ever find me?"" was like an insult to the reading audience. And protagonists are only interesting for what they actually do---the character of Siena for all her ""fiery"" drive, was a passive character, receiving most of the action. It made the story tedious."
3,potboiler,this book was a lite and quick read but not much substance. it was hard to really care about the characters.
2,Kama Sutra By The Numbers,"Despite what Ms. Bagshawe's agent thinks, Tilly is not the next Nora Roberts. Her sex scenes are more like ""Kama Sutra By The Numbers"" than they are sensuous; her emotional descriptions leave the reader flat (""Siena was scared sh**less"") and her physical descriptions are more hygienic than descriptive.Even so, I read it from page 1 to page 500-something and was enthralled wondering what evil, selfish and nasty things the characters were up to. It was always ""what comes next?"".In some prurient way, I quite enjoyed it...but I will not run out to buy Ms. Bagshawe's next effort."
1,Yawn...,Decently written yet utterly predictable Harold Robbins-type novel based on dysfunctional Hollywood family; don't understand how it could possibly construed to be chick-lit (other than having a young female protagonist)?? Finished it but not sure why.
2,Jackie Collins she is not!!!,I thought this book would follow in the tradition of a Jackie Collins novel....NOT. I found that I hated most of the characters in this book so I did not care what happened to them. I forced myself to read the entire book to see if it got better but it did not.
2,More bored than adored,"This is my first time reading this author. My 21 year old daughter, who actually purchased it, warned me. She and I like similar books at times, and she didn't think I would like this one. I must say I haven't read the whole thing, but from the beginning it was apparent it is for a crowd that prefers their sex scenes a little more on the vulgar side, not to mention the McMahon family is a little too dysfunctional to be believable. If you like rags to riches or riches to rags stories involving the English, by all means try Saffron Skies, very well written."
1,misconceptions of Americans by some Europeans,"I had forgotten the misconceptions some Europeans have of Americans; I had thought there would be greater understanding between cultures by this time. This novel indicates there is much more (besides fantasizing)other countries have to learn about America. I was disappointed while trudging through the first 99 pages of this tome, and had not the fortitude to proceed. Since there remains many good American writers to read, I shan't waste any more time on this one. It seemed a meandering, youthful flight of fantasy - more like the consistently bad Joan Collins, than the good Jackie Collins, who's been stateside more than a few decades."
1,I Can't Believe It Got Published,"While the book is a mindless summer beach read, the horrible story structure, grammar, and lack of editing makes one think it is actually a hoax perpetrated by Warner books. New York Times best sellers list? I have seen 7th grade essays written more proficiently than the 725-page drone that concludes with the last two paragraphs discussing horse [...]. Give me a freaking break."
1,Too Melodramatic. A third-rate soap opera.,"Beginning with the fact that the book is based on a famous Hollywood family of dysfunctional actors and movie producers, just gives you an idea of the parallel universe out there, and even though we know fairly well about such parallel universes, it's just impossible to like and commiserate with such a spoiled, egocentric, self absorbed and immature character as Bagshawe's leading lady.I swear I wanted to scream while I was reading, I just couldn't take it anymore!!!!!!! And my God, these people suffer such tragedies are so utterly out of touch with their inner self that you just want to drop the story.I honestly thought of throwing the book away or just leaving it somewhere to be forgotten but as a rule I never leave anything (much less books) unfinished so I had to take it until the very end. It finally came though. Don't get it if you value a good read."
4,A Solid Book,"This book would be on my list of the Top Ten best sales books to own... but it would be in the middle of that list. The author breaks apart the buyers processes into roles and issues and it is helpful.There is a better book out there titled ""Sales is Dead."" However, this book would still be an excellent addition to your library and much better than most of the books which have been written on sales process."
5,Great recordings,"A great recording -- no small feat. Britten, Pears, Brain, Goossens and the New Synphony - incredible artistry. BUY NOW"
4,Illiumin,"OK; I'm not a Benjamin Britten fan, but have been studying Arthur Rimbaud, and was curious about a musican interpretation, inspiration, or whatever you want to call it."
3,"Great Repertoire, Excellent Communication, Flat Intonation","""Starting Here, Starting Now"" contains some wonderfully written songs about human relationships and emotions. Maltby and Shire give us good tunes and well crafted lyrics (touching and catchy, too). The combo plays very well. The dissapointment comes from the out-of-tune singing done by all three of the cast members. Loni Ackerman, George Lee Anderson, and Margery Cohen throw themselves into their characters (which change every song), delivering their messages loud and clear. But, there isn't one cut that is not affected by flat intonation. Too bad, really."
1,"CDR's, not the original item!","While this is a great album, unfortunately Amazon is not selling the Rounder Records disc itself, instead a poorly-made CDR with photo-copied liner notes. Moreover, the packaging was terrible, causing the jewel case to have cracked at several points. A complete rip-off, for 18 dollars?! Apparently you can only trust the independent sellers on Amazon."
4,Masterful sitar solos,"Glorious sitar music from Pakistan, originally issued as part of a UNESCO music collection. The slower, melodic introductory ""alap"" movement on the first raga seems fairly standard issue, but when the tempo picks up, Sharif Khan proves to be a dazzlingly fast performer, creating a new drone out of the blurring effect of speed itself. In addition to two longish ragas, this album includes an unusual third track which explores the traditional music of the Punjab, a style which I find particularly appealing. Recommended!"
2,It should have ended with London!!,"The premise was great and the movie seemed to start out strong, Margarita Levieva was awfully cute as the tough girl, and the first few repartees were snappy... but 30 minutes into the movie it felt like mad editors had run amok! Suddenly, none of the characters decisions made any sense... (or mattered!!) and who wants to root for a poorly developed character!! Seriously... the movie would have gotten another star if Justin had just used the ticket to London!! (Obviously... you would have to watch the movie to understand that - but... it's not worth it)I cannot and do not recommend!! Go watch Chumscrubber instead :)All the best,Jay"
4,Give this one a shot,"One possible reason for the wide range of reactions to this film, I think, DOES have to do with people reacting to its marketing, which was a little misdirected.I really liked this film, but I saw it with almost no preconceptions. What I found was a profoundly moving treatise on the nature of forgiveness.If you open yourself to the impact of a modestly genre-busting film brimming with a certain kind of emotional intelligence (sharply observed characters, terrific performances) and a sly way of using the trappings of the supernatural to talk about what is really a spiritual issue, you may really appreciate this film.The kid's real problem, from the opening moments, is that he has no capacity to forgive. Of course, hardly anyone his age does, these days, so it might be easy to miss if that's your teen hero's tragic flaw..."
4,The Invisible Movie,The movie is great. It came in great shape. The only problem is I wanted full screen but it came in widescreen and it didn't say anything about the movie being in widescreen.
5,good movie,"was surprised, this was a recommended find and i ordered it not knowing how it would be! it was really good!"
3,Not the Average Haunting Scenario,"The ideas and plot behind this story is outside of the box and intrigueing, but lacks the degree of suspense you often crave in a haunting film. I was difinatley suprised by the twists mixed in through out the story."
1,The invisible part was the thrilling part,"The movie was not intriguing. It was a good story but I was throughly unimpressed with the lack of suspense. They billed it as a thriller but should have billed it as an out-of-body love story. They duped people into wasting their time. It was predictable and kind of stupid at times. Miraculous that she was shot and was able to make it to the hospital, that the guy who shot her was such a bad shot for a career criminal, when she shot him he automatically died and the guy who nearly dies forgives the girl who tried to kill him? If the police could have the dam shut off why didn't they do it to start with. I could go on and on. It is like horror movies when they go outside. I was continually scratching my head as to why they would do that. If you haven't seen this movie don't unless you want to see a crappy unrealistic love story. Yes I know it was a movie but I can only suspend my belief so so much."
4,really good movie,for once the girl is beating up and killing the boy lol and its not just a paranormal movie about a ghost boy its very original
3,"Interesting premise, slippery execution","The idea here is that the young man who may have been murdered might not be dead, so his ghost (?) self is trying to get the still-living people to find out what is really going on. Had the lead actor been more charming, I might have been more generous with my review. It ends up being more about the young woman who tried to kill him so in a way it loses some focus."
3,The Invisible,"This movie was in the same genre as The Sixth Sense, but neverless well done. Again, I bought the movie because Alex O'Loughlin was in it and even though his role was relatively small, he was great. The story was good, not great, because it had been done before, it was light watching."
1,Awful in EVERY possible way!,"Save your money, Save your time - this movie is not worth a moment of anyone's time. I'm all for supernatural thrillers, mystery murder dramas, etc...but this movie is just bad - poorly acted, scenes are so over-dramatic, it's just so far-fetched. I rarely give out reviews, I rarely give one star as a rating but this movie surely deserves it."
4,Different type of ghost story,"This is a different type of ghost story that's also a great thriller. A teen who is beaten and left for dead in the woods finds himself in a 'limbo' state of being. He's not truly dead...yet, but if he doesn't get someone to get his semi-comatose body help soon he will be completely dead. The problem is the only one who can hear him in his ghostly form is the girl who tried to beat him to death in the first place. A good twist on a supernatural tale.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
5,"Best movie since ""THE DEPARTED""","I won't get into the details of what happens plot-wise so as not to spoil it. This movie is multi-tiered with several themes running at the same time, and that's what makes it special. It has great character development, but there is a little bit of disconnect about the female lead ANNIE, that should have been expanded. Forget the ""movie runners"" about this movie as it is TOTALLY different from what you expect.And its not a take-off on ""Poltergeist"", or ""Ghost"" theme wise-its definitely STAND ALONE. Once things start to happen its like an electric shock all the way to the end.BUY IT-YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."
3,The Invisible,"What a nice change. I instruct High School At-Risk students and I wanted to show a movie about setting goals and thinking about your future. A student suggested this to me. It is a B-to C+ quality film, but there is a definite message they portrayed in this movie. I checked out the book, because I always believe the book is better than the movie--this was a definite no for the first time in my life. The movie was a bit too long in dragging out the search, and you have to have some imagination when watching this, but I will show it again another year."
3,Average paranormal story.,"An intelligent young man (Justin Chatwin/Nick) is ""presumably"" killed and his body left hidden in a remote place by a kind of bad girl from his school (Margarita Levieva/Annie) as she thinks he reported to the police a jewellery robbery she had committed. Then, he wanders the streets and around his school and home as his soul is trapped between heaven and earth. Nobody sees him. He tries to communicate with anybody, unsuccessfully. The film has plenty of nuances, such as the behaviour of Nick's mother played by Marcia Gay Harden/Diane, the tenderness and concern of Annie for her baby brother. Nick, horrified, thinking he is really dead, discovers in a clever way (I won't tell) he is not dead at all. From this moment on, Nick decides to take some action despite nobody sees him. Alex O'Loughlin plays Annie's boyfriend, an ex-convict in a small role very different from the lovely vampire from the ""Moonlight"" series. Watchable film even though it is not a ""Sixty Sense"" one."
3,Commercials made this movie...,seem a bit more interesting. The plot line sounds like a great story but the movie just didn't make it happen. It seemed like they just threw it together and splat...out came a movie. The acting wasn't toooo bad but a bit more skill would have helped. I can recommend it for an older audience since there is a bit of violence and cruelty.
3,It wasn't a bad movie...until.,They had the almost murder victim fall in love with the would be killer by seeing her dance with her hat off in a nightclub. I was willing to overlook the fact that I didn't really feel much for the main character and accept his justified anger at the people around him. I was even ignoring the main character's sudden dismay at being dead when not to long before he was thinking of committing suicide. And I was ignoring some of the stupid stuff that kept appearing throughout this movie. But they reached the limit of my suspension of belief with the possible love story twist. Nothing is explained properly in this flick and the only person the main character seems to show the most angry emotion with is his mother; not the people who tossed him in a pit to die.
2,You Expect Better Than This From Disney !!,"Very disappointing - the whole idea of the movie was very good - it just did'nt gel together and you have to like at least one character - NONE were likeable , not even the guy dying who was the so called hero of the movie as well !! It says ""from the producers of The Sixth Sense"" - that was a great movie , this one was more like a cheap TV afternoon matinee ."
2,Not what the previews promised...,"I agree with what seems to be the general consensus here - this movie is just ""eh"".We rented this after seeing a couple previews for it. There was no rating on Rotten Tomatos, and the previews gave it a ""6th Sense"" feel - a half-dead boy trying to unravel the mystery of his murder (or attempted murder).But that is not at all the case. There is no mystery. The movie tells you, from the start, who tries to kill him & why. Therefore, there is really no compelling reason to keep watching. You know who does, you know why, and you know that in the end he'll wake up from his coma.If you're into Ghost Whisperer, Touched by an Angel, and those types of shows, you might like this. It is a very teenage show, and very very low budget.I give it 2 stars for a nice idea, but I barely was able to finish it & would not watch it again."
1,Disappointing,"The previews looked great, but the movie was very slow and uninteresting at times. Toward the end it picked up a bit, but overall I felt that it was a waste of money. I won't watch it again! Not a movie to buy!"
2,It has a potential plot but it fails because of poor execution,"It has a potential plot but it fails because of poor execution.The idea of a man's soul/ghost trying to tell any living person where his body was is interesting. In the movie, he was not completely dead yet. He's just half dead or unconcious. The problem is I don't feel sympathetic or related to any character at all. It might be because of the acting and directing. After 45 minutes into the movie, I did not care about their fates at all.For supernatural genre, I prefer Ghost, the Sixth Sense and Just Like Heaven."
2,"Good concept, but...","...it fell flat on it's face as the storyline progressed. The characters were unbelievable and the movie was full of ""movie cliches"" that i just could not turn a blind eye from. The suggested ""romance"" between the female culprit and the ""ghost"" was unbearable and unnecessary. Unless you are of the ""herd mentality"" and never question faultiness(The female lead throws a tire iron through a Jewelry Store window completely shattering it...really??) then this rehash of ""Ghost"" is not for you. Enjoi??....i sure the hell didn't.****Spoiler Question****How did she make BAIL??"
3,disappointing,"This is a fantastic movie until about the last ten minutes. Then it goes right off the rails, into complete nonsense for no apparent reason. All I can think is something got changed from the original novel or something, because you just don't see this coming.*****Mild Spoiler*****Once the scene at the dam is finished, just do yourself a favor, stop the movie, and say ""And they lived happily ever after."""
4,The following reviewer disagree's. Gives Thumbs UP !,"This is a remake of the Swedish movie 'Den Onsynlige' and there is no doubt that its worth your time. One of the best movies I have ever witnessed. There is little to no fear elements in the movie, but it's such a beautiful story about a ghost that it can't be ignored.If you think you can figure this movie out by the synopsis above, think again- 'The Invisible' is a epic story about life, death and the choices you make during your time on this Earth. For such a bright film, it's quite Gothic in a sense of the irony the story evokes. In the end, what really matters is making your life worth something and taking control of it on your own- the lesson is a great one, and hopefully this movie will entertain along with inspire. Check it out if you can."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I WAS EXCITED TO SEE THIS MOVIE. FROM THE PREVIEWS I EXPECTED A GREAT SUSPENSE, DRAMA. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. THE MOVIE TAKES FOREVER TO REALLY GET GOING AND IS A LITTLE SLOW. I FOUND MY SELF PUSHING THE FAST FORWARD BUTTION MORE THAN ONCE. I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANY OF THE ACTORS IN THIS FILM AND THE ACTING LEFT MUCH TO BE DESIRED."
1,Crap,These days it seems that everybody wants to do the tricky 'Sixth Sense' kind of movie. This movie just didn't get it for me. The lead kid was just too cool for school and the story was simply predictable and pretty weak.If you don't have anything else to do... find something. This movie isn't worth watching.
3,Flimsy plot and characterization,"A 30 minute Twilight Zone episode stretched to more than three times that length. Somehow, we still don't learn almost anything about the protagonist despite that, other than he's a terrible poet.A rental at absolute most."
4,Greatest CD in my collection,"This is definetely the best CD I own, along with the 69 eyes and some HIM. If you like their sound, you'll like this. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because their first CD, All Eternity, hasn't arrived yet, and I'm not sure if it's better."
1,Save your money,Do not buy this thing. Made my M1A jam and it slid up the op rod spring instead of staying against the receiver. I e-mailed Buffer Technologies about it and they were worthless. Had one for a Mini 14 that made the rifle inopperable as well.
5,smooth operator,"keeps your op rod from slamming against the reciever. Nice and smooth operation, reduced recoil is noticable. this product works great."
1,Junk,"The hole for the recoil spring is about the size of the recoil spring so the spring pushes right through the buffer. It needs a metal washer with a slot in it between the the spring and the buffer. Since I know how to make the needed washer I will alter it accordingly and it should be a good item, If you can't make the modification then I would strongly suggest passing on buying it."
1,Earrings,I was very disappointed with the earrings because they did not look very authentic. I returned them the same day I received them.
4,hospital pharmacy,I work in a large hospital pharmacy and I found this book to bevery helpful in my practice.
5,Stubby Pringle's Christmas Book,"Great tale well told! I couldn't believe that I was able to find this book on-line, as I have been looking for it for years!"
3,Average at Best,There were only about one or two songs that I liked on this CD. I didn't think the production quality was that good.
4,"Someday, every golf cart will have one of these - until then...","I think every golf cart should have one of these - it does a pretty decent job of keeping clubs and ball clean throughout your round.The price was pretty reasonable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that they could have made it easier to bring to the course with you and slapping it on your golf cart. That's not so easy because (1) you want to put it on the outside of the cart where it's easily accessible - probably with bungee cords or velcro - but there are no attachment points to facilitate this - right now, all you can easily do is throw it in the basket in the back, which isn't convenient for use. And (2) you need to get it back and forth to the course in your car - but it's full of soapy water. There should be a snap-on lid to keep it from spilling in your trunk. As a result, I only use it at home which limits its value."
5,Works Great,"This ball washer was easy to mount, works great and looks very sweet on my cart. Looks like it will last for years, and the price was right also--great product."
5,music muse,"This diary of music genially displays the expression of true talent, creativity and splendor. From her deeply touching lyrics to the extraordinary mixture of Afro Arabian sound, Dalinda's Turquoise tells a musical tail of many experiences that touch every human spirit. Weather you want to laugh, cry, dance or rest, Turquoise will draw you in to the depths of music genius.I pray for the undying success of such talent. I hope to see more in the future"
2,WASTE OF MONEY,"I don't get what all the fuss is about. I have dry skin and sensitive, but I wanted to try it on my arms/legs. I even tried it on my cheeks, just to see. First off...the small jar is TINY. Maybe I mistook the description, I expected a pint of ice cream size...and got less than a cup. I had to stir it when it arrived, and it resembled green mud more than blue salt in the picture. The scent was not strong, but sour. It did not irritate my skin, but it did nothing to help it either. I had to use very small fingerfuls, trying to save the product to last...but even after a week's use I noticed no difference in my skin. The salt did melt in my fingertips, but wouldn't I get the same effect by making this myself and saving 30$?"
2,Mushy,"Didn't like this product. All of the actual ""scrub"" (salt) is at the top and minimal. Felt like I would've been better off mixing some olive oil and actual sea salt to give myself a good scrub. It did smell nice and I like the packaging."
5,"""Spiral"" is among my favourites albums on CD!","I won this CD as a Birhday gift. This one is really fantastic, because Vangelis can create an atmosphere with a lot of magic, which gives us an impression of infinite somewhere and unknown (vide ""To The Unknown Man""). And, look, this title was released in 1977. Another curiosity was the track ""3 + 3"", which was used to playing on several channels of television, on radio stations in Brazil.To sum up, I like this album a lot. ""Spiral"" has to remastered several times."
2,Poetry of the Home,"The book received was in excellent condition. After reviewing the contents, I returned the book. It was one of those book with a pretty conver and as they say, never judge a book by it's cover. I did not find it a good reference book for decorating. It was written in a flowery poetic manner with no pictures. I would not recommend this book to any of my colleagues."
1,It was not an interior design book as listed but a poetry book.,I hated it and returned it because it was not an interior design book as desribed. Still waiting for credit on my gift card. It is taking a long time for the credit to appear.
2,Constant Metal Smell!!,"It does a fair job of putting moisture back into the air but if you leave it at Level 3 all night, your nose and your respiratory system will smell like metal all day! I'm serious. Thumbs down on this item."
4,Good size,"Got this for my large bedroom since it gets so dry in the winter. Works well and doesn't leak, which was key."
3,My Experience,"I'm awarding three stars because the construction of this item seems somewhat flimsy AND because one of the hoses was disconnected.Due to the disconnected hose, water was sputtering out of the top all night, leaving me with a wet carpet.After attaching the hose, Air King is quiet and boosting humidity in my dry-as-a-bone 15% humidity apartment.Good Luck!"
3,"Widescreen, but yet another cut version","It appears that the only uncut version currently available is the Region 2, Scandinavian release (and sadly, it's not widescreen)."
2,Boring and far from the author's potential,"Sorry. While I love the cover, this book is very similar to the author's Kirinyaga, the contents of which I did not like very much. I found Paradise boring, dull, and generally unsurprising. There is essentially no science in this fiction... it could just as well be classified under general fiction (and if it were I doubt it would be particularly well reviewed). The writing is pedestrian. The story lines are also. The parallels to the recent history of Kenya are so thin as to be almost transparent. It's almost as though the author has taken issues and episodes from Kenya and converted various words ands phrases to another place and time, and left it at that. I was, sadly, disappointed by Kirinyaga, and I am even more disappointed by Paradise. I feel this author has MUCH more to say than this."
5,battery,seems to be working just fine. Haven't used it for more than an hour total since I have had it.
1,Excuse me??????????,Excuse me?? Where are the Facts and Fictions of Chronic Pain? As a sufferer of chronic back pain I thought that this book would provide me with some new options for treatment and pain control. Judging from the excerpts that I read all it is is a story of scaterbrained woman who can't figure out if a medical doctor is doing her any good?? Please - are there really people out there that are really this stupid?
1,Dissapointed,"I bought this movie as an Eid gift for my 6-year old son, but was soon dissapointed as I started to watch it myself. The quality of the cartoon is very poor - worse than how cartoons were like four dedcades ago. Secondly, it clearly promotes shia idealogy in the narrative. Lastly, it depitcs Prophet Muhammad - both in voice and animation - which is offensive to the mainstream Muslims."
5,let the tears fall,"I find this book incredible. After reading this book I have discovered that weeping clenses us from the inside, and the spiritual implications are simply that we become healthier. Our emotions were never given to us to be repressed, but they were given to us so that we could communicate how we feel. God wants us to be honest and good stewards of our feelings, because as Christians we glorify God through them. Tears are not meant for our hurt but for our resoration through the Holy Spirit. That seems to be His method of clensing the soul."
4,Richly illustrated depicting cars of the world in detail,"Hard to find but worth the search. A visual encyclopedia and beautifully illustrated with hundreds and hundreds of cars from 1770 thru 1970. Includes show cars and obscure rare cars from countries like israel, egypt, china, and russia. This book is a reference source for any automobile enthusiast. I can't stress enough the beauty of the illustrations. Includes concise technical details."
1,It's a ripoff,Don't waste your money. This is basically a few pages photocopied out of other books. There were almost as many blank pages as there were photocopied pages. Go to the LDS church's website (LDS.org) and you will find much more information - and it is FREE!
3,Holocaust to Hogans Heroes,I really enjoyed reading his book.I downloaded it to my kindle. I learned alot about his childhood and surviving the Holocaust.Anybody the lives through that is a miracle. I only wish he talked a little more about being on Hogans Heroes.
3,Short,"First, I would like to clarify something that another reviewer apparently didn't understand. Robert Clary was NOT in a ""death camp."" He was in a ""forced labor camp.""Second, based on what I have heard from him in several documentaries made for PBS, Robert Clary has a lot more that he could have said in his autobiography. He was obviously holding back on information or censoring his experiences. My feeling was that he would take his experiences to the moment of pain and then pull away from them. As much as I liked Robert Clary as Corporal Louis Lebeau on Hogan's Heroes and as a narrator of Holocaust documentaries, I must admit that his writing is not as intense as I was expecting."
2,Interesting Account of the Holocaust,"I have been familiar with Robert Clary's work in soap opera, particularly DAYS OF OUR LIVES. I had read several accounts in various magazines, mentioning his experiences in the concentration camps and was quite interested in reading his experiences in his own words.As an account of the Holocaust, it is of value. However, this was not an easy book to get through. Clary makes reference to so many friends and relatives that after a while it becomes difficult to keep any of them straight. The book varies from depressing to matter-of-fact, without very much relief for the reader from the overwhelming depression of the Holocaust. I had been looking forward to reading about his entertainment career after the camps to get relief from the grief, and then started to feel bored."
4,The courage to forgive,"I was very impressed with Robert Clary's autobiography. He told of his life with honesty and realism. The nightmare he endured could have destroyed him, or embittered him, or silenced him.It did silence him for awhile--and understandably so. The only way to survive such horror is to shut down one's emotions and/or block the memories.But Robert Clary has told his story to teens in high schools, in speeches and interviews elsewhere, and now in his book.Don't forget...but do forgive.That's true courage."
4,A Quality Read,I always knew that Bess was going to have problems at some point with her weight but I really didn't know when. It was thoroughly suprising what she did in this book. Nancy tries out for a tv station and Micheal Giannelli also gets the job. You can tell that they wll have a rough time in the beginning and eventually fall in love. This brings real life issues of college life along with a thrilling mystery. I liked it alot.
5,Brimming with indefatigable human emotion.,"Edited by award-winning poet Alfred Nicol, The Powow River Anthology is an anthology of contemporary poetry by 24 members of the prestigious Powow River Poets. The free-verse creations espouse a variety of themes as diverse as their authors, from a transcript of the words of God to His prophet to coping with the knowledge of what one weighs when stepping on the bathroom scale in the morning to a mother's grief at losing her son. Though each poem is brief, all are brimming with indefatigable human emotion. ""Wide Brush"": Late afternoon, in the slant winter light, / Where men are painting their white buildings white, / The shadows of their ladders climb the walls / To meet the covering darkness as it falls."
3,Review for Timbuk2 Macy Women's Tote,"THis is a great bag, as are all of these Timbuk2 bags. it's a big small, but is easy to carry and lightweight, with a place for everything."
3,Pink Fairies & The Deviants - 'Son Of Ham',"Appears to feature the exact same track listing of the various artists CD, 'Hogwatch - For A Few'. Unreleased material from Mick Farren, the Deviants, Larry Wallis, Philthy 'Animal' Taylor (one-time Motorhead drummer), Flying Colours and Fairyhead. Personally, I wouldn't pay more than, say $4.99 for this second rate compilation. It's okay, nothing to write home about."
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book. Beautiful in every way. Expensively produced and a joy read.First class color reproductions throughout the entire book and great texts, essays and notes.I could not recommend this book any higher."
5,Everyone should read this book!,"I already owned a copy of this book. I purchased it for a dear friend for research. As a serious Bible Student, it shows where the origins of many ""christian"" beliefs derived. Real eye opener. Get this book! Great seller! :)"
3,There Are Better,"This was an ok review of his time in the White House although in the current age of tell alls this does not necessary stand up. It is interesting to compare his view o the last days of the Nixon years with the ""Final Days"" or ""Exile"". Overall this is a readable book but there are many better."
4,Refreshing view on food ideas,There is alot of good food ideas in here Ive been going through alot of the main meats and book marking recipes to try.it also gives you a good understanding of carb values of each meal.
1,Wasted,"What a waste of money. Most of the recipes called for Atkins products you can't find in stores (go figure). And not many of them even sounded appealing. I skimmed through this book once and since I couldn't find anything I could actually make quickly with ease, I haven't picked it up again."
5,Great recipes,"My husband and I are both trying to lose weight and wanted recipes that contain ingredients we might have at home. These recipes are common sense and easy to make, as well as tasty."
3,Not quick and easy,"First let me say that I absolutely love the Atkins Diet, I lost 60 pounds in 3 months but I dont think this book is quick in easy. Some of the recipes call for ATKINS products which have been discontinued such as Atkins quick and easy bake mix. I tried to find these products by going th the Atkins website but everything except the bars and shakes have been discontinued. Also a lot of the recipes call for uncommon ingredients so unless you have the money to go out an buy all these ingredients dont by this book. I recommend that South Beach Quck and Easy cookbook because the diets are similar especially the first phase and these recipes are much easier."
1,Dissapointed,Too many recipies call for obscure Atkins products. I love Atkins but have not been helped by this book. I'll keep looking.
3,Richard Gere...,always seems to find the strangest movies to participate in. He does a great job in this one. The movie is about a man that is a down on his luck author that wants to get published so bad he goes to extreme of making up an authorized biography of Howard Hughes. Things go awry and prison time is served for him and his co-horts. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but isn't too bad. I watched it on airplane flight so I think it may have been edited.It is an interesting movie that makes you want to find out more about the character the movie is about.
2,Huckster,"I bought this film because it was directed by Lasse Halstrom. I can't put my finger on it, but there was something missing in this film. I admit I may be biased because I'm not a Richard Gere fan, but this film seemed a bit lazy in places and not well developed in others. As far as the real story of Clifford Irving's shenanigans, it's hard to believe someone would go to such lengths to become famous and it's even harder to believe that he duped an entire industry. In the end though, while the subject matter made for some interesting history, the movie failed to fully flush out the characters and the reason for their indiscretions both publicly and privately."
3,Ordered medium rare - got overdone,"We watched this last night - it was ""interesting"" - but had too many disconnected disconnects. That is to say - some of the basic facts were right - but too many were wrong and what could have been an interesting ""autobiography"" - wasn't.The night before we watched ""Girl with a pearl earring"" - now there is a movie to be enchanted with - excellent - 5 stars."
2,This is an old Windows 95 / 98 book!,"I bought this book as follow up reading after taking the A+ 2006 course. I should have noted the year 2000 publishing date in Amazon's details, because this book is OLD NEWS! It's poorly organized, and being that it's a ""pocket sized"" book with tiny 4 5/8 X 8"" pages, that didn't help much either."
5,Standards by standard bearers,"A nice selection of jazz standards played perfectly by four accomplished jazz musicians. Not as adventerous as the group's recordings with Shelley Manne that preceded this album, but some beautiful stuff. Misty is classic."
5,Ciaphas Cain does it Again,What a cool book. The action is great and the story never looses its pace. A must read for people who love interesting characters. Ciaphas is one of the most entertaining characters out there. I hope that Sandy Michaels keep writing novels about Ciaphas.
3,Good but no subtitles or closed caption,"Fast delivery and packed well. Beautiful production with superb acting. However, this 1972 BBC video has no subtitles or closed captions. Sound is okay but not great. Even with my hearing aids, I have to sit too near the TV to understand some dialogue but miss much. Obviously the vender couldn't have added text but could have warned buyers. If I missed a warning I apologize but would still rate the product lower than I like."
4,Anthony Hopkins was much better as Pierre than Henry Fonda,The Hollywood version of War and Peace was lacking in all respects but given the shortness of that presentation it should be expected. The war scenes were very brief and unimpressive. A number of characters/story lines were missing which detracted from the richness of the story. The scenery was lovely but did not make up for an abbreviated version of the original story.
2,Dull,"How anyone can say that this is the equal of, or even better than, the 1950s Russian version beats me. Take the battle scenes -- Sergei Bondarchuk's Russian version used tens of thousands of troops from the Soviet army; the BBC version uses about six extras chasing each other over the South Downs. If you want to see a version of War and Peace that makes the book out to be an English drawing novel by someone like John Galsworthy (the televised version of whose ""Forsythe Saga"" preceded this by a couple of years) you might as well buy this. On the other hand if you want to see one of the greatest film adaptations ever made go for Sergei Bondarchuk's version."
2,Very low budget and old-fashioned acting.,"I watched this mini-series when it first aired on American TV in the 70's and thought it was wonderful. But I have to admit, by today's standards, it's hopelessly old-fashioned and hokey. The acting isn't terrible, it just belongs to a different era, when everyone was larger than life. All the speeches, and the gestures and mannerisms are so over-the-top. (Does Hopkins really have to drop or knock something over in every scene for us to know he's shy and clumsey?)The women are either giggling idiots or sobbing constantly.But the battle scenes are the worst, consisting entirely of men marching in uniform across fields, then someone fires a cannon or rifle, and a couple fall down. That's it. Really.If you strip all the philosophical musings and dialogue out of the novel (which they had to do to keep this at a reasonable length) all that's really left is a soap opera about rich people trying to decide who to marry."
2,What's that I hear?,"This version of War & Peace was looking good, but the sound was so bad that I had to return the tape. With no full refund, I won't risk being burned again with another copy."
1,Drawing Room soaper,"I saw this when it was on PBS way back and just rewatched. I recall liking it, but not ths time around. The Soviet film has great casting , size and sweep , opulence, a dream like quality and a foreign feel to it. This production has a so so cast, Natasha especially bad ...the others are rather bland , tho Dolby suits the bill...and lacks any of the Mosfilm`s strengths. I soon began to fast forward through all but the war sequences ( the outside troop parts are like two hundred Brits playing soldiers in the meadow) ."
2,go to the Russian version,"Only Russian could really interpret ""War and Peace"" correctly. Go to see the film made by Soviet Union at 1967."
2,"Far below I, Claudius","I got this BBC mini-series because I found ""I Claudius"" to be the best historical fiction I had ever experienced in any medium and since this was also written by Jack Pulman, I had hoped it would be of the same quality. It wasn't. W & P is tedious in the extreme and continuously put me to sleep. Unlike the powerful dramatic narrative that seized my attention in Claudius and pulled me relentlessly through to the end, W & P seems pointless - a prolonged upperclass Russian soap opera."
2,War and Peace - 1972 Version with Anthony Hopkins,"The BBC version is great! We are really enjoying it! It's almost like watching a play. Have not gotten to the disc with the war scenes, but if it's anything like the earlier portion, anticipate it will not be disappointing!!"
5,More than five stars!!!,"Firstly, I think the book is one of the finest pieces of literature written in the past two centuries for its beautiful exploration of human thought and emotion. Secondly, I think this film does justice to the book within the constraints of time and relatively scant narration. I tried to read the book as a teen after seeing the film and lost interest in its complexities, but after seeing the film again as an adult, found the book to be quite beautiful and the film to be a nice rendition of the book. It explores many of the ideas in the book without destroying theatrics. My only complaint is that due to possible audience boredom, the film doesn't delve further into the ideas Tolstoi explores. Read the book."
4,Blackout Squad is Off the Hook,"I first heard gotti when a 3-6 mafia cd had a sample of ""reppin north memphis"" on the LIFE cd. Anyone who has heard this knows how gotti can put it down. This cd was a great buy. Im very happy with the cd overall. The first disc is better. U gotta get it man im tellin ya. Disc 2 is good too. A MUST buy."
4,A good read,"I read this book over 30 years ago and decided to read it once more...it is as relevant to me today, as it was then. I enjoy Robbon's work, whith this book topping my list!"
3,Other Books,"The main character here wants to get into publishing and make some money, but finds out it isn't too easy.Then he discovers the porn business, and the hidden side of that. Starting out on a small scale, he gets involved, starts to make some cash, and then decides to try and start his own empire. Not the easiest thing to do, and will have consequences and garner unwanted attention."
3,Harold Robbins is dead,"This book is out of date. But if you can get it for free, and you have 15 hours with nothing else to do its interesting. You'll find out how far out your father was. You taught he was a serious reader, now you know better. This is pornography in a brilliant disguise. But the brilliance is somewhat old fashioned."
5,Great Picture and Divx Capability!,"I've had this DVD player for about 5 weeks and so far I am happy with it. The video is great and battery life is satisfactory. The only improvement I would make is to beef up the audio, if possible."
3,Good Enough,"I got mine about a few days ago and have tested it with various divx 3.11 home movies. it works on all of them (just like my philips 642). my only comment is with divx movies of 640x272 video size. it gets stretch vertically when using a general setup/tv display of WIDE. the only way to view the movie in correct proportion is to use general setup/tv display of NORMAL/** and display mode of NORMAL. result is movie zoomed to 1/2 of its size (black bands on all four sides). display quality is so so. great for carrying a dvd disc with several divx movies. when playing mp3 music, it pauses for a couple of seconds between songs.fast forward in the unit by pressing the next (skip) button for a few seconds until the 2x appears on screen. repeat the process to get to a higher rate."
5,Now THIS is music!!,"It is with much happiness that I can listen to a consumate artist's rendition of classic music, performed with such beauty and power.This album covers it all from mellow lows, to crystal clear, sweet highs, to theatre-style production number types!! Brent Spiner sings with such style and grace, this album should be ""required listening"" for all young people today ... so they know what REAL music is, performed by an incredible artist! Anyone who loves great music, will love this one!"
1,Schlock from an attention grabbing hack.,"Brent Spiner made a record? Yeah this really tore up the Billboard charts! It is no secret that Brent's ego must have really pushed hard for this. While on TNG and in the films it always had to be about Brent. The other actors had to cowtow to his enormous ego and demands. Ironic, since it was he and his scene grabbing that ultimately ruined the TNG films. This ""vanity"" project is no different!"
4,A fun disc deserving re-issue,"This disc is a lot of fun; I love especially the track, ""It's a Sin To Tell A Lie"". FWIW, if you're wanting this disc but can't afford it here, it can often be had for under $20 on eBay. Here's hoping for a re-issue!"
4,Stop bashing Brent Spiner!,"First of all, if you are looking for a goofy album to laugh at, this isn't it. Buy one of Leonard Nemoy or William Shatners' many albums for singing so appalling it's actually funny. This is a serious tribute to some beautiful older standards. Some are fun and lively (""Toot, toot, tootsie""), some are slow and romantic, (""The Very Thought of You""). These are great songs and Mr. Spiner sings very well. All technichalities about his limited range or overdone vibrato aside, his voice is pleasant and nice to listen too. I wouldn't say that this album is worth the price, but it deserves at least four stars! Good job Brent, for breaking out of the cheese-ball tradition of bad albums by ex-Star Trek stars. I hope Brent will someday put out another album and release his rendition of ""Blue Skies"" from ""Nemesis""!"
3,Nothing could be finer,"Yes, this album is by ""Data"" of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Brent sings mostly standards here, with the exception of one recent song by Randy Newman. Brent has a decent tenor voice, but he can't really sustain a note. Any time he tries to hold a note, there is quite a bit of vibrato. Not Tiny Tim level, to be sure, but still a bit distracting. The main fault with the album is that arrangements by Dennis McCarthy are rather dull and unimaginative. The two songs here that were arranged by John McKinney, on the other hand, are lively and fun. Too bad he didn't arrange the whole album. This album will appeal to Star Trek fans only. Trekkies will be especially interested in ""It's a Sin (To Tell a Lie)"", which features back-up vocals by LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Jonathan Frakes and Patrick Stewart, plus a recitation by Stewart."
5,Great Stuff,My wife and I love this Suddenly Salad and living in a rural area it is impossible to find for some reason. Finding it on Amazon was a very pleasent surprise.
4,An excellent text book for the beginning Spanish speaker,"I used this book in a college Spanish course and found it to be excellent. It is at the beginning level and would be suitable for anyone that wants to learn the language.Every chapter has a thorough vocabulary list, with topics in the chapter reinforcing the vocabulary. Many pictures will assist visual learners. In addition, an appendix of common verbs and their conjugations in all forms makes an great reference.The one downside is that many exercises focus on a group activity, generally with other classmates, so these can't be completed studying alone.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn the Spanish language."
3,a title for your review:,"This comedy is about 3 friends in their 30's who have been reunited by the death of their friend from their childhood. The 3 made a pact to one day go on a treasure hunt. When they return to their old clubhouse, they discover there deceased friend has left them a map to a real hidden treasure. They go on a journey up-stream, through rapids, bear country, and somehow get mixed up with hillbilly drug makers, finding themselves up s### creek without a paddle, or a map, or their supplies, or a boat etc.The movie is ok, but I think it could have been a lot better comedy then it is. But it's still just a movie to kick back and relax and have a chuckle over. There is nothing really special about it, but it might be worth the rental to you.A highlight is seeing some references to ""Deliverance"" and then Burt Reynolds actually being in the film!"
3,Shallow but entertaining,"""Without a Paddle"" is a comedy that is unlikely to evoke huge laughs out of anyone over the age of 12. Nevertheless, I found myself enjoying the rather shallow but still entertaining story of three guys who get together after the death of a childhood friend to go on a camping trip planned by said friend, seeking a buried treasure they had always talked about as kids.Seth Green plays his typical annoying high-strung, socially inept character. Matthew Lillard is a successful businessman trying to decide whether or not he wants to do the whole marriage and family thing with his fed-up girlfriend. Dax Shepherd is a teenage rebel turned adult criminal trying to find his big break.I would recommend this movie as a rental - it's a fun movie to sit around watching with a few friends. I definitely wouldn't recommend the purchase of the movie without seeing it first, though."
2,MISSION SEE THIS MOVIE ABORT! ABORT!,"I realize, by reading previous reviews, I am massively outnumbered with my rating, so I better write a damned good reasoning.Okay, first off, the concept is cute. Three childhood friends try to live out their dead friend's dream. Aww. Cute.BUT, the movie gets off track and far-fetched in the blink of an eye.The trio encounters a bear who mistakes a man for her cub, pot-farming hillbillies, two rather hairy women who live in a tree a.k.a. Earth Flower, a grounded pilot who lived in the woods for 50 years, and possibly a few more horridly unrealistic unfunny attempts at comedy.With these three actors, I expected much much more. I'm very disappointed.:("
2,Passable Paddle,This was an okay movie. It has some fun parts like for instance When they were huddled together with R Kelly playing in the background. Saying this never leaves the cave. Also when the hillybillies were chasing them. But besides that I've seen better wait into it comes out on DVD.
2,"cheap laughs, some deleted scenes should have been kept","I rented this movie off of a reccomendation that this movie would be funnier than Anchorman and Dodgeball both of which i haven't yet seen. I thought this movie focused way too much on the 2 stupid guys chasing them, and the maudlin of the 3 friends just talking amonst themselves about the death of a fellow friend.There were funny parts, and there were very bad formulatic jokes. and the overall drug part was dumb. I hate it when they bring drugs into a movie as something funny, I hate drugs. they are the abomination of this world. and just seeing htem onscreen makes me angry and ruins the movie from there on.the funniest parts of the whole movie was ina deleted scene which they cut, it was the parking space part, where this crazy guy just acts crazy to Seth green. it was hilarious.This movie had the actors to be really great but most of the movies plot was really stupid."
3,Silly Fun,The movie was dumb/funny. I liked the male bonding jokes and the cannibis growing hillbillies.
1,What a piece of dung,"Awful. And I am a big fan of stupid movies such as White Chicks and Dumb and Dumber, etc. This movie started off funny, and the characters had a bit of an edge. Showing up to the funeral with the Harley was classic stupid funny. And the movie was rolling along great until they met this Bear. Then all of a sudden, the movie changed into a really, really bad and boring movie. I made it through this entire movie, but it has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. So there!!"
2,Pretty Cheesy,"This movie definitely has some funny stuff in it, but overall it is pretty bad. If you've ever been to the Northwest you'll know it is not like this at all. They are in this vast wilderness and they happen to ""run into"", a pot farm and it's backwards owners, some hippy chicks in a tree, and some old dude who couldn't find his buddy D.B. Cooper for 30 years (who they found 5 minutes after leaving his cabin). I'm all for stupid humor and like I said there are some funny parts, but man, this movie was not good. Watch it if you have some time to kill and want a few laughs, avoid it if you ""really"" want to laugh and enjoy a film for the entire 90 minutes, because this ain't it."
2,AS BAD AS YOU WOULD THINK,YES this movie is as bad as it sounds. Even though I like Seth Green a LOT and that other guy looks just like a young Peter Fonda. I can not recommend this. It has a few funny moments but overall sucks badly. LAME PLOT
1,Very poor movie!,I thought this was a very poor movie & I could hardly wait till the movie ended. I thought it was a waste of any ones money whether it be the film maker or the audience..
3,Doesn't get better with time,"The first time I saw this movie I CRIED from laughing so hard.I don't know if that was because I had no idea what to expect or because it just struck me as very, very funny at first.I purchased the DVD based on the good laughs, however, when I saw it again, I realized that this is the sort of movie that really only works the first time around.It's still a cute, though overly cheesy movie, but unlike other films, this one does not get better the more you watch.I still give it 3 stars because it's just one of those films you watch on a really boring day. NO deep thinking required, no strange twists or plots to follow.I still get a few chuckles here and there and that's about the best that can be expected from a light comedy such as this."
3,About as expected.,"Minus the dueling banjos it is you-know-what. There were a few funny moments. The sexual inuendos were uniformly overdone and stupid. So, on average that's where I'd put this DVD, smack in the middle. Average, a flat and featureless C."
3,Dopey fun for all those who appreciate it,"I'm almost sad to say that this is a college favorite of mine. I remember originally seeing this in theatres with my roommates, and subsequently the DVD became a regular weekend event. Yes, it's stupid movie humor as to be expected by this particular set of actors, but gosh darn it I like it! If it makes anyone feel any better, a slice of history is used to explain the trip through the Oregon wilderness--which of course leads to the wilderness survival nightmare that is this movie. Still, it's fun and it has a bit of heart, so that is why I love it so."
3,Deliverance Academy Without A Paddle,"Cross Deliverance with Police Academy and what do you have? An amusing story of three friends that set out to find D.B. Cooper's money after another friend dies. For the most part the movie is a comedy with the same type of drama found in ""City Slickers"". If you enjoyed that movie you will probably enjoy this one as well. The three find themselves in the back woods of Oregon encountering all types of animals and people. Everything from a Grizzly to gun toting pot farmers and tree hugging women. Nice cameo by Burt Reynolds. Overall not bad and certainly worth at least a rental. Chances are though if you like this type movie you will want to own it. The DVD quality is good but nothing in the way of extras."
3,"Made for slapstick or SNL lovers, but not me...","Ludicrous, downright corny, totally unbelievable, and over the top... this movie was not something I would have chosen to watch on my own, but since other members of my household thought it would be funny, I watched with them. There were a few moments that brought a chuckle, but this is most definitely a 'man's' movie, and not something a typical woman would enjoy. My teenaged son laughed through the whole thing.This movie TRIES to have a moral 'lesson' at the end, but the corniness of the whole thing is what really sticks out. Along the lines of Caddyshack and that type of slapstick humor, this movie is good enough for a chuckle or two when you have nothing better to do. Unless you're a guy who likes corny humor, and then grab yourself a couple of beers (you'll need them, they'll make the movie funnier, I'm sure--something has to!) and enjoy a few belly laughs. If nothing else, you'll learn that women don't really need to shave their legs."
4,So Stupid It's Funny.,"I went to watch this with my friends last night, and indeed I was skeptical if I was an even to get a laugh out of it. But to tell the truth, it was one of the great mysteries that Hollywood at times creates: a movie so stupid, that it was funny. And there were a few touching moments in it that kept the movie in a good sense of reality.Basically, it's about four childhood friends. One leaves in the beginning to start out his life, but then dies what appears a few years later. You see how the three others have turned out in those years which gives a humorous twist, and they decide to go on an adventure when they find a map the dead friend had left them. And on goes the at times hilarious and other times just plain stupid adventure. And surprisingly, at the end of the film when they finally find the treasure, there's a nice philosophic conclusion that I found quite inspiring.Overall, it's a movie to watch with your friends and just relax with after having a rough day."
3,You had to be there....,"I watched the movie with my 15 year old daughter and we enjoyed it. I've seen the reviews written some not so good and I wanted to add a little something. To really get the part of the girls in the tree and a few other jokes you would have had to at one time lived in Oregon. There really are people like that there. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I'm just saying to understand them you would have had to experience those type of people. Having lived in Oregon for two years with my daughter we got quite a kick out of the movie. Even though the movie was filmed in New Zealand it made you feel like you really were in Oregon. There are places in Oregon as beautiful as in the in the movie still today, it made me miss what will alway be in my heart my other home."
1,Presence of Seth Green not a reliable indicator in this case,"I assumed that Seth Green's appearance in this film was a pretty safe cue that this film would be great. Not so. Not as hip as Buffy nor as funny as Bunny (Greg the), this film may be the exception to the rule."
4,Really funny,"This movie was much better than I thought. I expected it to be a stupid flick, full of stupid sight gags, but it's a funny movie."
3,3 1/2 Stars....,"I heard only great things about this movie. Yet, when I saw it I was not laughing my butt off. I thought some parts were funny but over-all not the best movie I have seen.Four best friends were going to go and hunt treasure and one of the four dies so the other three decide to go and hunt for a treasure to continue the lost ones life. On the trip they run into many different types of people and animals. From a man who lived in the woods forever, to girls who are protecting a redwood to pot growers...but the humor that is meant to be in each scene is not there. I wasn't feeling it. It seemed forced and it was not the best I have seen from Green or Lillard. I personally would say rent this movie don't buy it. It is more of a one time movie."
3,A Good Movie,"""Without A Paddle"" is a movie that you don't know if it will be good or not until you finally watch the movie. After seeing it, I can say that some will like it and some won't. The story is a good setup for the adventure they have, jokes are there, but it kind of gets old by the end of the film. The acting was decent for this genre and the scenery for the film was beautiful. From waterfalls to green forrests, it's definitely something to see. The only problems I had with the film are that the villains are kind of lame, two country boys trying to kill the three because Seth and his friends find out that the country boys are growing Mary Jane (And I don't mean Peter Parker's friend). The other problem was that the ending was predictable. With all of that said, it's not a bad movie."
2,Brainless humor,"Film was fair at best. If you want to kill an hour and walk away forgetting what you just watched....this is the movie. Other than 1 or 2 funny parts, the movie is nothing to write home about."
3,Without a paddle,The movie was in good condition and was okay! It was full of humor and it was a good movie!
3,Exactly What A Bear Does In The Woods,"Just another buddy road trip; 3 idiots in search of D. B. Cooper....over 3 decades after the fact! But, whatever, any excuse to throw 3 hapless 'friends' in one danger filled wilderness adventure after another: an overly friendly bear, rapids complete with a waterfall, and 2 killer pot farmers.The humor is skewed so that most of the bad/funny things happen to the poor little guy (Seth Green). Throughout, I kept wondering why these 3 were friends, they treat each other abominably (through constant ridicule and cruelty, bullying). I know I wouldn't put up with it.Sight gags abound, yes, excrement is involved. And besides a lovely couple of tree huggers, there's Burt Reynolds as a hermit. Why not, they tried everything else.I'm ashamed to admit I laughed a couple of times.It's pretty much what you'd expect."
1,one of the very worst...pure garbage,"I am writing this review because i just watched the movie in question and i now have pent up feelings of resentment and vengefullness for everyone involved in the production of the film. i went into the experience open and excited; i had previously gained trust for all three of the main characters from their other roles and i was expecting a pleasently fun and entertaing picture. Instead i found a horrifically disappointing piece of trash with only one funny moment: ""Thank you for putting broken glass where my kids play."" if you've seen it you know, if you haven't, please do yourself a favor and rent or buy some other movie. PLEASE, i wish i could have my 1.5 hours back. consider yourself WARNED. -Michael p.s. I still like burt reynolds aka ""Malone"""
4,::.The Mob.::,The Mob is a pretty good book. It's pretty interesting although it's boring at the beginning it picks pace at the end. It's in the Red Maple this year! I can't wait to read the other Red Maple books!! Yay!! Oh and buy this book. It's awesome and a half =] LOL
4,great value,I think that this is a great deal. The product came to me in great condition. My only issue is that sometimes the Auto focus does not work as well as I would like. I have friends who have bought more expensive cameras with similar problems though. Overal a great buy that I would recommend to a friend.
4,Space Shuttle,"This is not a toy for the under six year old group. However, a six to ten year old with an active imagination would enjoy it. The toy is also great for adults who appreciate inexpensive nick-nacks that can renew their imaginations."
1,Not worth the money,"The picture is very misleading. It makes the space shuttles, etc. seem large when in fact they're all tiny. This is a toy my son circled and wanted Santa to bring and was so excited to get it. As soon as he unwrapped the gift, even he said it was very small. Most items are Matchbox size and made of cheap plastic."
4,Nice Space Set,"This set is very well loved by my son. The set has very nice variety for the space loving kid. The durability is average to good. The only downside I saw to this set is that they are a little smaller than I thought they would be(the largest rocket is about 5"", my fault, I should have read the dimensions!) and the price may be a little steep considering the size. I would still buy them though because he loved them and it is still worth the price to get so many different space toys in one box."
2,poor construction,I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. The wheels on one of the jets were already broken when the box was opened. Fortunately my nephew is autistic and didn't care if the wheels fell off.
3,Good to learn - as long as you're not a beginner,I bought this book as a beginner - which it is clearly not for. You have to have some knowledge of guitar to be able to even use the first pages of this book.
4,Good for beginners,"This book was great for me to learn different types of music and timing. I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone above the intermediate level. It is great for beginners- as it helped me develop a few basic songs from the licks I learned.Overall, its targeted for those who are new to the guitar. There are some complex solos, but that is in the very back. Don't waste your money if you're looking for heavy rock licks, either. All the songs I learned to play were fairly mellow."
4,Great book and learning experience,"I learned a lot from this book. It's challenging for someone that had been playing only 6 months, but it made me loads better. I loved the first half of the book with it's exploration of different styles of rock, and the continual learning curve that the difficulty of the songs entailed.Only reason for four instead of five stars is that the last half of the book had too many songs of the same style. I can tell Stetina likes metal, but I could have done with a few more styles of rock at this point, as I didn't buy a metal instructional manual, but a rock instructional manual.That being said, a highly recommend you take advantage of a well thought out, and fun, intsructional book."
3,Steep Difficulty Curve in Lessons,"Great explanations of rock guitar technique, good practice CD and accompanying guitar tablature. The first two lessons were fun and easy. After that, the lessons became considerably more difficult. I would prefer an easier ramp up. Have set the book aside for now, but will probably pick it up again after improving my playing using other tools."
5,so good I'm going to read it again,"I Watched a Wild Hog Eat My Baby--what a great title! It made me laugh at the bookstore, and I expected it just to be a bunch a crazy tabloid stories. But instead it's a really in-depth history of the tabloid papers. *Why* they printed scandal and gory stories, and *how* they wrote them. I've never been a reader of the tabs, but the behind the scenes stories were fascinating. Sloan did a really good job. Highly recommended!"
2,Small Step in the wrong direction,"I was disappointed in Louis Sachar's sequel to Holes. I was expecting his layered writing to hit a new level with this one, but he just took a step back, probably trying to make a beeline for another film adaptation, but this one would fail on the big screen. It barely held my attention in print. I prefer the lunacy of his Wayside books to this mediocre title."
3,holes was so good...,"and small steps was so boring. i spent the whole book hoping it would all come together at the end, and it kinda did. i'm glad i read it, but only because i was curious about the sequel to holes."
2,Poor sequel to a great book,"A girl with a disability and a boy with a bad past together they have to take Small steps to make it.This begins with an old but favored character named ""Armpit"". If you are reading this book and expecting Stanley I this book think again he is of no important in this story. The only old friends in this book are X-ray and Armpit.This book starts off with armpit work for a lawn service then x-ray comes and tells him his win plan to get money. He bought tickets to a singer named Karia Deleon and is going to sell them for a lot of money. This story tells many views. One is the view of Karia and there is the view of armpit and is friend that has a speech problem. This great book but poor sequel to one of my favorite books makes this a must have to any Holes fan. This is a great book and you can only know how it happen if you buy the book."
3,A Little Boring,"Small Steps is too predictable in the first half. You can tell what is going to happen with X-ray and Armpit trying to sell the scalped tickets but it takes too long to get there. The second half is where it gets exciting and unpredictable. In the first half you see the puzzle pieces before they're in, in the second half puzzle pieces come flying in from all different directions. Will X-ray and Armpit sell the scalped tickets? Is Armpit in love with Tatiana, a girl at school, or the famous singer Kaira DeLeon? I think it has too much bad language and in a competition Holes would win 24-7. Others may disagree but this is what I think."
3,"""Not as Good As Holes""",This book isn't as good as I thought. Maybe a little too far but it does give good messages.
4,This is a great book!,I thought this book was really good. I encourge you to buy it or check it out at the library. The only thing I would like to say is that this book is for 13up+ There was some sex referances and some language which the book could have done without. But other than that it was great!
4,about a book,"small steps is a great book if you liked holes. it tells the story of armpit and x ray. it is full of interesting things that happen to them and his neibor that is only ten. armpit and x ray end up getting inftrouble for scalping tickets to a rock concert. then armpit runs into the rock singer. she likes him, and they start to have a romantic relationship. then the singer finds ot what he did."
5,By MEEE I would like to say some words,"This was a GREAT book!!!!!!!!!!! It was soooo powerful and taught a lot of great lessons about things people face today..... Even though it was the sequel to Holes, whick was a great book as well, it was extremely different yet extremely spectacular. I think it should be made into a movie!!!!!!"
4,Small Steps,"I loved this book. No, its not like Holes, but I don't believe it is supposed to be. I really liked how Sachar intertwined all the different types of characters and plots, along with linking to the past of Camp Green Lake. Because of some of the small yet sweet romantic parts, perhaps this book should not be read by students younger than 8th grade. Small Steps is a very good book and can even relay a message of why we all should take small steps, sometimes."
4,still a good book,"Let me start out by saying that Small Steps is a GOOD BOOK. I didn't like it as much as Holes, but then there are but few books which I liked as much as Holes. If you're expecting a conventional sequel, this is not it. Holes was a light, funny book with a supernatural twist and a larger than life Texas outlaw. Small Steps is a down to earth teen book with a bittersweet ending. It deals heavily with issues such as racism, crime, and, to some extent, drugs and sex.The characters are also different. You won't even find Stanley or Zero's name in the book. It's all about Armpit and X-Ray. Armpit is trying to rebuild his life by working for a landscape architect, and X-Ray convinces him to take part in a get rich quick scheme, the results of which pretty much screw up Armpit's life.Just because you liked Holes doesn't mean you'll like Small Steps. But it was a GOOD BOOK."
5,Small Steps is not only for adults.,I know a young girl at the age of nine and she has read small steps. She loved it. I aso love it. It is a great book for ages nine and up. It is about a boy that has a nick name armpit that plans to take small steps to his future. He takes a too big step and is in a bit of a problem. His friend x ray plans to help. Read and find the step out.
4,Emotionally addicting page turner,"Louis Sachar writes an action packed companion to Holes with heart stopping complexity. Armpit, the main character, tries to take small steps to accomplish his short list of goals, but he gets tangled up with a rock star, questioned by the police, and barely escapes prison. You will not be able to put this emotionally addicting novel down. Voted a must read by Mrs. West's sixth grade class."
4,Create Your Own Review,"Braden W. Review of Small Steps by Louis Sachar, March 18, 2008.Small Steps is a book by Louis Sachar. It is a sequel to his previous book Holes, telling the lives of armpit and X-Ray after ""Camp Greenlake."" Armpit is trying to take small steps in order to get his life on straight. The two of them are attending a high school in the slums of Houston. When X-Ray tries to convince Armpit to join him in a get-rich-quick scheme Armpit is reluctant. Once X-Ray suggests ticket scalping, Armpit finally gives in and gets into a real mess. It just so happens that the tickets are fake and Armpit is caught by the police. Armpit's eternal conflict is keeping his life on straight and out of the hands of the law. Eventually people (Including a celebrity) start to realize he is a good person that he didn't do anything wrong. It is hard not to root for Armpit in this story of struggle after ""Camp Greenlake."""
5,My daughter loved this book!,"This is an excellent follow-up to the book, Holes. There are a few swear words, so I would suggest being mindful of the age of your reader."
4,Sachar Strikes Again,"Another wonderful telling by Louis Sachar. This story, with a very modern setting, has all the adventure and twists of Holes but an updated feel. The cadence of the text is classically Sachar and the characters feel like neighbors. Tackling some interesting issues like race, disability, celebrity and reform, Sachar comes through with a thought-provoking but not preachy narrative. Middle school students will enjoy this good read."
5,My son loved it!,"After reading the book ""Holes"" and seeing the movie, my 11 year old son requested this book. I bought it for him and he loved it. He could hardly put it down."
3,So-So,"If you are looking for a show about Alaska, this is OK, but you can find better ones on cable. This is mostly a show about driving through Alaska, with an occasional RV shown on the road or in the background."
4,A realistic view of a possible Middle-East scenario,"In the footsteps of his previous novels The Warbirds and Force of Eagles, it shows formerly irresponsible pilot Jack Locke in command of a squadron in the 45th with the grandson of the President under his command. This book shows how Matt Pontowski changed from a spoiled grandson to a top-notch fighter pilot with confirmed kills in combatOne thing about Herman that happens quite often, is that he seems to kill off his characters prematurely, such in the case of Col. Waters, Thunder Bryant, and in this book, Jack Locke and Mike Martin. However, this ""aura"" of death serves as a prod for the upcoming officers to prove their worth. Some do, and some don't. The former fighter pilot certainly writes a great book, one that is worth reading over and over without losing any of its impact."
2,Cichlids Love it BUT...,"My Malawi Cichlids love it, BUT it nothing like the Cichlid formula. I called New Life before I bought this and they said it is the same ingredients as the Cichlid formula. Well after I used it the first time I knew that I was not going to like it. I have a 125 gallon tank and was shocked to see how the small amount of food (3mm) that I gave to the fish turned into this ""orange cloud"" that moved across the tank. They ate all of the food before it hit the gravel. It is very messy. I have to give a very small feeding with the (3mm)and finish with the (1mm). I found that I need to clean my wet/dry much more often. I also found that I have to do a larger water change to get back to clear water. The clean up hassle is not worth the larger food size and will go back to the (1mm Cichlid Formula) when I finish this 5lb bucket."
5,takin the stage,Have searched for years to find this on cd format. The wait was worth it. You cannot put a price on the endless years of joy this will bring. Strongly recommend this selection. Do not wait too long to get yours. It really is a rare and difficult cd to aquire.
1,"Boring Work, Even Worse Acting","This so called ""thriller"" did none of the above, mainly it only made me insensitive to the terrible acting portrayed in the film. About one hour is wasted by the director in presenting incomprehensible scenes from a spoiled and wealthy family. Hopkins is terrible here, playing an annoying rich junkie who doesn't know if he has killed someone or not. The others are squandered away in unmoving, flat dialogue and the end does not surprise anyone at all with its proclamation. Slow and tepid also...."
4,"great toy, but cheap made.","This is cheap made, but a lot of fun while it holds together, I purchased it as a gift for a spacial needs person who loves to throw footballs. He really enjoyed it."
3,hUGO FRENCH IN THREE MONTHS,This book complements the Hugo French in three months three CD language course and remains consistent with content over the reprints.
4,classic old school sci fi,I think this is a classic story. Just goes to show that the latest whiz bang effects are not required to have a good story. Johm Pertwee is a great Doctor Who The extras are neat. The BBC has done a fabulous job converting the show to dvd
4,One of my favorites,"Inferno is one of my favorite Dr. Who stories and an excellent sci-fi tale. I would give this video a five-star rating except that the quality of the tape is uneven at best, and very poor in spots. This unevenness in quality is present in a number of CBS/FOX and BBC Dr. Who VHS tapes."
3,Ridiculous..,"Not exactly sure why so many rate this as a ""classic"" or ""one of the best Dr. Who's ever"". The whole green ooze turning people into green skinned werewolves who like heat and can be repeled with fire extinguishers, has got to be one of the dumbest plot devices ever thought up for Dr. Who. And while interesting, what the heck does a parallel universe have to do with the main drilling through the earth's crust story? If you watch the DVD extras, they explain the werewolves and parallel dimension were added to stretch it out to 7 episodes, but maybe they should have just picked another story in the first place when they realized the story wasn't long enough for a 7 parter."
5,Doctor who at it's best,World in trouble and the Doctor is stuck in an alternate time line doesn't get better then this
4,Excellent Old Doctor Who,"One of the best of the classic series. Third Doctor at his typical sarcastic and selfish. Plus, the whole alternate universe subplot adds an interesting twist to the story, a twist that's been copied almost verbatim by more ""mainstream"" series such as Stargate SG1. A great example of the third Doctor's time."
4,Classic Who,"There is something about this episode that still grabs me till this day. A story with an unusual formula that works, perhaps modern writers can learn a few things from such story structures.I believe in this new era of entertainment we need fresh ideas, new perspectives, a sense of wonder, something that can grab our interest and surprise us. Sadly any such shows that promise to take us in this direction are cut short, leaving us wondering what we missed out on, and what kind of people make these crazy decisions.This is one such episode that we are taken for such a ride, not afraid to show us the destructive result of the arrogance of man."
5,A very thorough book,"I am using this book with non native speakers who struggle with English tenses and it is a very good book. In many other languages you don't have tenses, so this is a foreign concept to some of my students. However this book explains things clearly and the exercises are excellent."
5,English Verbs - Practice Makes Perfect,My ESL students use this book as it gives them great practice in using verbs.It is well set out and easy for them to follow. I time them doing the exerciseswhich makes it fun for them to do. I use the book in conjunction with the othersin the series.Cathy B
5,"GREAT bottle, but 24oz does not fit cup holder","I LOVE this bottle! I bought two, one for my 3 year old (16oz) and one for myself (24oz). I love that when it gets knocked over, his or mine :), it doesn't leak, but the 24oz does not fit a cup holder as it said it would in the description. Although, I do like the bottle enough to order a second 16oz bottle for myself to take in the car."
2,Developed A Leak,"I originally bought the .75 liter Camelbak because one of my friends had one and raved about it. I was also drawn to the vibrant color choices. At first this water bottle worked well for my indoor rock climbing sessions and lifting work-outs. I was disappointed to discover that the bottle was too big for standard water bottle holders on cardio machines (stair steppers and stationary bikes). After about 6 months of occasional use (3-5 times a week), the bottle developed a major leak on the lid and had to be tossed. I will not be replacing it with another Camelbak. As a loyal Nalgene user, I know there are better water bottles on the market."
2,camelbak water bottle,The plastic protector is easy to lose. The water flows out intermittently after either pulling off the plastic protector or moving the mouth piece from an 180 to 90 degree position- very annoying. It holds a good amount of fluid which is the only positive thing.
3,"Great, Until It Started Leaking","This water bottle was amazing, as advertised it didn't taste like plastic at all, and was dishwasher safe. I used it daily for the past 3 months, but it just started leaking a lot. Never did this before, now it leaks profusely from the top of the lid and the bite valve area. Before it broke I was happy that I found the perfect water bottle, now I'm feeling scammed for buying a product that only lasted 3 months."
4,Really like the concept.,"I like the bite valve concept, upright drinking (versus turning the bottle upside down), and the anti-leak feature. I bought two of these but one of the valves leaks a little when the bottle isn't upright. The bottle fits in the cupholder in my car."
5,"Great every day use bottle, no problems","This is a great product. It's BPA free which is a must nowadays. The bite valve and screw top work as expected and if you knock it over or overturn it, nothing leaks. It holds 24 oz (over actually) which lasts me a few days in the office before refilling. The plastic is thick and durable, but it's not too heavy to carry around. I like that the straw extends to the bottom so you can (almost) drink up your water before refilling."
5,Great purchase,"I bought this thing after looking into BPA in cheaper plastic bottles. I bring it around to school so I can sip on it when I have cottonmouth, which I am plagued with eternally. The valve is so convenient, it almost encourages you to drink water. I'll have a full bottle on my desk when I sit down to watch a movie, and before I know it I'm almost halfway done. It's gotta be something like smoking, where some have trouble quitting because they like the feeling of having a ciggy in their mouth. Well this is good because water isn't harming anyone.7/2/2011: Still really like this bottle, I take it with me whenever I drive somewhere or go for a bike ride. I tried freezing it and the valve broke, it's like drinking through a 1mm diameter straw. Though this is my own fault, don't make the same mistake. It has also been dropped a couple of times in the past week, once at 20mph onto a sidewalk and again but not quite as fast, no damage but a bunch of scratches on it."
5,Just What the Doctor Ordered,"I had been messing around with those cheap Rubbermaid water bottles and the other free pieces of crap you get from various functions and conventions but decided I'd had enough of them. So, I invested in a CamelBak and I love it.The bottle is sturdy, leak proof, but I haven't dropped it yet to test how well holds up against impacts. I will say that the bite straw took some getting used to. It's nice for the gym since you don't have to worry about flipping open a lid and then drinking from the bottle."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I got this water bottle because I saw the plastic was BPA free and was not like the other plastic in regular Gatorade plastic, which is linked to some cancer. The water bottle is very durable, it's in my backpack all day while I am at school, and it doesn't leak. EX: You can turn it completely upside down and it won't leak, even through the mouth piece. Strongly recommend it for people looking for a durable water battle!"
3,Disapointed,"I had such high hopes for this bottle to be leak-proof...but its not. Once I received the bottle the label said ""Spill-proof"" and then in fine print it said ""This bottle is NOT Leak-proof."" So, I can't just toss it in a bag and not expect some of my stuff to be a little wet. As long as I keep it up-right the leakage is not really an issue and it still serves as a portable watter bottle, However, if LEAK-PROOF is what you're going for, i've found that ANY bottle with a straw/mouthpiece will not suffice. A simple screw cap is the only 100% leak-proof way to go."
5,Best bottle I've bought!,"I just needed a simple water bottle. After some time on Amazon, I came across Camelbak. I had some reservations about the bite-value but it turned out to be the best thing since slice bread. It's a great buy...the best bottle I've bought. It's BPA-free, hand-free, not flimsy like other bottle, good price for value, etc. I am planning on buying another one soon."
5,love these bottles,"I love these bottles and basically carry one with me at all times. I bought my first one over 3 years ago and finally had to replace it because one of the ""hinges"" on the side of the spout broke.I take one to work every day filled with water from my reverse osmosis system at home. I wish they had bottles with an even greater capacity than 1 liter because I often drink the entire liter before the end of the day, and the tap water at my work is horrible.Normally I'm fine with room temperature water, but this past summer was especially hot in Texas. I started filling it with ice first and then adding water and found that a neoprene insulating sleeveBuilt One-Bottle Tote, BlackI already owned for carrying a bottle of wine to parties I so infrequently attend fit the camelbak perfectly and did a good job to insulate it and keep it from ""sweating"" everywhere."
5,camel bak water bottle,"This water bottle is great! i really enjoy it. this christmas i gave my best friend one for her birthday. then i was really jelous and wanted one myself. So i told all of my family to get me one and now i have three!The only bad thing about this is that the straw has a handle so you can lift it out. if you ever drop it , the handle might break. That happened on 2/3 of mine!"
4,Wish the bite stem lasted longer.,"We love these bottles especially since we've found the insulator sleeves to cover them and the replacement bite valves. Our only problem is we've had to replace two of them because the bite stems break after about a years use. The plastic pins that ""lock"" it in, break off. It would even be helpful if you could buy a replacement cap. But, for now, you have to buy a whole new bottle. If not for that,,, they'd have 5 stars."
1,"Michael ""New York""","I find it hard to believe there aren't more negative reviews. To get a full sip of water is practically impossible. You have to bite down and suck hard to get the liquid out and it only comes out in a dribble. If anybody wanted to use this on a treadmill, forget it. The bottle does look nice but if you want something where you can get a quick drink this isn't it."
2,not good enough for me,"It's way too big and looks like cheaply made, returned it for a refund. I also bought a stainless steel one,Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel Colored Water Bottles with Poly Loop Cap, that's way better, I kept it."
1,Made with Polycarbonate?!? BPA = Bad.,"Doesn't this water bottle leach BPA since it is made of polycarbonate (plastic number 7). This plastic has been banned for use by children under 3, and definately shouldn't be used by anyone. Unless I am mistaken, which from research, I believe I'm correct."
2,How Do I Use It?,Should A Water Bottle Come With Instructions? The Answer Is Yes When Refering To The Camelbak 32Oz. Better Bottle. The Bite Valve Is And Still Remains A Mystery To Me. I Bite And Have Flashbacks Of A Baby Bottle Nipple. Not Enough Liquid Entering The Mouth. I Took The Valve Off And It Works Better For Me. Although Without The Bite Valve The Bottle Loses Its Spillproof Lable. Inovative Handle Molded Onto The Bottle Cap. Plus Bottle Appears To Be Very Durable.
1,These are old kind,"These are the old model, made of Lexan, that leaches Bisphenol A.Sadly I have a few of these that I am tossing out for Camelbak's new Tritan model. (Bisphenol free)"
5,one doesn't suck right,"I purchased several of these bottles and all but one (one of the blue ones) are wonderful. The one bottle doesn't suck (draw water from the mouthpiece)well, can this be corrected? Could you send me another cap with mouthpiece for the one bottle?"
2,Straw broke!,I've been using this for a while and I noticed the straw is barely hanging on. it has a nice look to it. But the top part could have been made more sturdy.
1,"Unpractical, difficult to use.","What a pain in the neck this thing is to drink from! It's hard to bite down on the cover and drink from the built-in straw. It is easy to carry but unless you are obsessed with not spilling a single drop of water, it's not worth the effort."
2,I drew the short straw on this bottle,"The size is great and the color is very rich. The top is very durable, but the initial trial of the bottle was interesting. You actually have to bite the rubber end to get the tip to open and allow you to suck water up the straw (takes some practice and oral talent). I teach high school and I wanted to use crushed ice in with the water to use at work. The straws are about an inch short of reaching the bottom of the bottle. When I add ice, the straw typically gets dislodged from the cover multiple times and I can't get a drink without taking the cover off and fishing the straw, which has now sunk to the bottom of the bottle. If I could melt the straw to the top, I would... I'd shop for something else next time."
5,Eco friendly water bottle,"I feel I am doing my part just by using this reusable water bottle. You can re-use this bottle over and over again.I filter my tap water and just fill this bottle up. I have two of these bottles. I keep one with me and the other in the frig. so I always have cold water with me.Millions of plastic water bottles end up in landfills each year. By using this Camelbak water bottle, I am helping keep about 600 plastic water bottles out of the dumps each year. Just think if everyone who reads this would stop using throw away bottles-- Lets say 200 people --that would be over 14,000 plastic water bottles less in a dump each year.You can put into dishwasher or hand wash in the sink. The best part of this water bottle that is differnt then others out there is that this one will fit in your cars cup holder. Most all others are too thick at the bottom, but this one narrows a bit at the botton and fits perfectly in the car.This product is a must!!!!"
2,"Must wash tip thoroughly, mine got moldy in 2 days! Warped in dishwasher","Must wash tip thoroughly, mine got moldy in 2 days! You have to take the tip off at least 4 times a week and clean it with soap and a q tip of expect serious mold, eww. I forgot it was not dishwasher safe,and washed it, it warped in dishwasher so I got a Klean kanteen instead because it is dishwasher safe."
4,CamelBak BPA Water bottle,"The design was an interesting concept,and when I recieved the product I was quite satisfied. It is well designed and fits all of my carriers in the back pack,lumbar pack,and belt holder.I have since purchased two more."
4,like it a lot,This is a great water bottle & exactly what I was looking for. The only thing I didn't think about until I started using it was that the mouth piece is exposed so it can easily get dirty and need to be rinsed more often than usual. The color is great & I really enjoy using the bottle :)
5,CamelBak Water Bottle Exceeds expectations,"I've only been using the CamelBak Better Water bottle for a couple weeks now but so far so good even though water bottles left in my truck overnight freeze solid. A few drops have escaped and frozen in the truck but if I leave some space in the top and make sure they're upright there is no leakage and no cracking. I attach a caribiner to the loop on top and I can take water anywhere. Bite valve ""rubbery"" smell and taste disappeared quickly."
4,Nice bottles. No plastic smell. 0.75 liters do not fit on most car cupholders,"Nice bottles. No plastic smell. 0.75 liters do not fit on most car cup holders. Cap has a valve for air intake (I think) while you are sipping. I bought 4 bottles (different size but same cap) only one cap works nicely. Valves on other caps do not seem to be letting air in properly and are just a little bit harder to drink from. If you want to take a big gulp of water, you may get a little frustrated. But, they all work."
1,Too much work!,You have to bite so hard that it's more work than it's worth. Maybe i just like to drink a lot more water per gulp but i sure don't get much out of it and it makes my jaw hurt from having to bite so hard! It makes me drink LESS water. I wish it made me want to drink more!
3,SPILLS AND LEAKS,"The bottle is well made and sturdy, BUT unless you keep it standing upright in a lunch bag (which most kids will not) it leaks terribly. Even when closed tightly and the straw valve fully closed. What a mess, thank goodness we just use them for water! I will add this also, biting the straw to take a drink is hard on the teeth. For both me (age 31) and my children (8 and 10) they complain that it hurts their teeth to bite down on it."
5,I finally found my perfect water bottle,"I have gone through at least 4 different water bottles - Nalgene and all the rest, with and without sip guards - trying to find a good one with which to work out. I never liked how the larger Nalgenes were hard to sip during a workout, and I didn't like having to unscrew bottles while on a treadmill or elliptical. I found this one on Amazon, and it is the best one I have ever seen. It has a removable straw, so you can drink any way you like. I have other Camelbak products for trekking, so I already knew how fantastic the sip guard was. Really, if you have been searching for a good water bottle, this is it. I like the variety of colours, as well."
2,Great but Keep it Clean!!! It can hurt you!!!,"I gave one of these to my cross country running nephew and he loved it. But noticed his time was declining and he was feeling sick. After several weeks of researching what the problem could be we discovered under the bite valve part there was black mold. YIKES...make sure you disassemble the whole top and clean it real good.Fortunately we found it before any serious health concerns had a permanent effect on his health. BEWARE...CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN."
3,Good enough but not what I ordered.,"I ordered the ""BPA-Free"" version of this bottle but received what appears to be an older version of the bottle. On the bright side, it arrived way before the delivery estimate. While I wanted to get the new version, I'm not annoyed enough to bother returning it."
5,Quenched!,"I'm crazy for this H20 bottle! Unlike the larger sizes, the 16 oz. size is formed with a tapered bottom, which fits easily in my new car's cupholders. Of course this smaller size also means it's lighterweight when filled, so it's easily portable in my handbag, sportsbag, etc. It holds both hot & cold liquids, so it's VERY versatile- We live where temps are sub-zero during winter... It's such a luxury to have an ABSOLUTELY SPILLPROOF container of hot broth, hot cider, cocoa, etc. During summer, I fill it w/ ice 1st & then pour water or juice. I use mine ALL year round. LOVE the finger carrier/clip attachment! Also worth mentioning- this is an incredibly sturdy, thick walled polycarbonate, imparts NO taste whatsoever into your drink. The drink nozzle flips up to drink & flips down/self stores to close it. I've owned & used the same bottle for over a year, it still looks & functions like new. Colors are fabulous. Best water bottle ever!"
1,DON'T BUY!!,I LOVED THIS water bottle until the bite valve broke off- not the silicone part but the part that the silicone attaches to.. and what was in there? GROSS MOLD.. i was so disgusted. You can't see it but it's there. I was always so careful cleaning this water bottle and then I found this? ugh..The kids version has an entire silicone bite valve that you can clean out. This one needs this too..
5,Nice water bottle...,"Nice wide mouth, markings on the sides to keep you aware of how much water you're drinking, easy to clean and easy to drink from.Durable, too."
4,Pretty Good,"I like this water bottle. It was nice to have a choice of sizes- I purchased the .75L and was happy that it fit into the larger drink holder of the console of my car. Also, it doesn't leak at all which is reassuring. The only drawback, I would say, is you have to bite the mouth piece pretty hard when you are sucking the straw. Not a big deal, though."
5,Camelbak drinking bottle,"The bottles arrived on time and were the right color. I have now purchased 15 of them over a period of about 4 months, friends in Europe have seen the one that I use and asked me to buy them when I was in the US. They are easy to use, don't drip, and easily come apart so that you can put them in the dishwasher for cleaning."
2,High hopes dashed,"We aren't an extremely active outdoor family but when I was researching for water bottles for my two boys, I figured these were a no brainer with all the high reviews. But not long after getting them, one of them started leaking water around the valve area on the lid. We figured it had something to do with the way our 6 year old was using it because our other sons bottle was doing really well. Then as I was sitting down getting ready to order myself one, we noticed the other one leaking the same way. We can't figure out why they would start doing this because they basically just sit out on the table or counter or sit in the car, no rough treatment. I was really excited to from such high reviews and was willing to forgive one cup as a fluke but not two. Sadly, I will be taking my business elsewhere."
3,bottle but leaks and hard to suck water,"Overall this bottle is good and I like it and use it.However there are some flaws in design of it.1. Bottle leaks if cap do not screwed super tight. Many times I didn't screw it very tight (and I have strong hands) and all inside of my gym bag was wet. I don't like it.2. Suction nipple is a bit tight. It may be for a reason, so it's not leak from there, but sometimes, after exercise you need to get a good big sip of water. And you out of breath. Then this hard sucking nipple don't give you enough water. It's happens rare, so not very important.Goods: Look very nice and attractive. Strong. I dropped it several times on the floor and asphalt and it didn't break, only minor scratches. My 1 y.o. son like to play with it and drink water from the ""papas bottle""."
3,I wish these worked for me!,"I want to start by saying that I LOVE this water bottle. I have never liked a water bottle as much as I like this one. I use it all day long, every day, and it has definitely helped me drink more water on a daily basis. With that said, I have to find a new water bottle. I have owned four or five of these in the last couple years and only one thing has caused me to replace them: my bite valve snaps off after 7 or 8 months of use! It drives me nuts, because the bottle is in great shape otherwise."
2,Mold.,"I loved the bottle up until one morning I went to go fill it and I saw mold in the bite valve. I cleaned it up thinking it must have been a fluke and maybe the temperature of our place mixed funny with some water, I know know, I tried to make up every excuse because really I love the water bottle.Well, today I think I've had a enough. I clean it every morning, only put water in it, and I'm not one to eat and drink. I feel like I'm doing everything correct, but I found some mold again today (after washing it this morning and drinking with it all morning. Can someone please help me here? I guess I'll write to the company, but I wonder if I'm doing something wrong.Why am I getting mold in the bite valve when I clean it every day? Thanks."
3,Good For Sippin',"I bought this water bottle for use while working out.Pros: It doesn't spill. It's sturdy. Easy to cleanCon: Impossible to gulp from this thing. I can suck in water faster from a typical straw.Turns out I can't be using this while doing heavy work outs, I need more water in short bursts. This bottle will remain in the fridge and be my sipping friend for a casual drink."
4,Probably the best water bottle you can buy!,"I'm very picky about my water bottles, but I think I found ""the one."" I got the 32 oz. black one with bite valve, and I know that drinking two of them a day will get me my 64 oz. daily requirement. It's fun to drink from the bite valve, but you really gotta suck on it. Luckily, you can interchange other Camelbak caps. It's definitely spill-proof. Love the carry handle. A bit hard to clean the bite valve, but I take a q-tip and that works. Very happy with this bottle."
5,"LOVE this fantastic, light, water-bottle!","I LOVE the CamelBak! This is my 2nd one. I bought the largest one as my first one and a dark color and used it for my green juices to the point where I could not get the smell and taste out of it no matter how I washed it so remember to have a dedicated CamlBak just for your water. This one is the 0.75L one and is a light color so I can see the water. The Orange is a lovely color. I take this everywhere from cycling to yoga to driving around to bed with me. You can drink from the Big Bite Valve without spilling water anywhere so it's lovely to drink in bed. Thanks to the CamelBak, I drink more water, measure my water, find drinking water exciting and absolutely love having this reliable form of water bottle so I never ever use water bottles again which is much better overall. I highly recommend this product to anyone and especially if you are an athlete !!"
4,Great water bottle,"I work at a wholesale club and was constantly buying water bottles from the break room, up to 3 a day. decided to check amazon for one and found this. Saves me a lot of money on the vending machine bottles and holds a lot more water. I fill it up in the morning and it lasts an 8 hour shift. No complaints really. I'd recommend buying C-clip that are usually made for keys, the water bottle has a little ring on it, that comes in handy so you can just use the C-clip to connect it to your belt loop."
5,Best Water Bottle Ever.,"I am not a water drinker. Most days I went 24 hours without having any water. Well I bought this water bottle at Target a week ago and I fill it up at least 5 times a day. I LOVE this water bottle. It's great, I take it everywhere with me. It does not leak, I love the bite valve part and it does not taste like plastic at all (another great part). I have already purchased another bottle because I just feel like this will stick with me for awhile and I might as well have two. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS WATER BOTTLE. A super great purchase."
5,Love this water bottle!,"I love this water bottle! I can put it in my car and not worry about it leaking when it tipped over. The clincher, though, was when I took it on an airplane. With all of the pressurizing and depressurizing the water bottle did NOT leak one bit!"
5,"Easy to use, easy to clean","I take this bottle with me to work every day and it makes drinking the proper amount of water even easier. The bottle itself is very durable. When I'm done with it, it disassembles very easily and is easy to get a sponge in for proper cleaning. I like this so much I've bought a second one."
3,It leaks,"Its a great water bottle for work. I didn't know it needed tablets to keep it clean, I usually just dissemble it and put it in the dishwasher. It does leak when on its side, it also leaks standing up too, and when your drinking out of it. It is really strange, and gets all over the place."
5,Good Stuff...,"They don't leak! There is a good amount of water in the bottle and you can take them anywhere. The lid makes for a great grabbing handle! I would recommend this bottle to anyone, especially at Christmas! It makes for a great gift!"
5,Greate bottle,"Bottle is very good, good quality. Dishwasher friendly. I drink much more water now. Also it's greate for Gym and traveling"
2,Where's the quality?,"I'm jealous of all these great reviews here. Mine broke within the first month without anything drastic happening to it. One of the nubs that lets the bite valve rotate snapped. Until then it was a great water bottle, but really I expected more for the price."
2,Love them while the lid holds up!,"My family has several of these, and they're great right out of the package. The problem is, the lids don't seem to hold up too well, and you can't buy just a new lid. E.g., the backstop valve in the center has come off of one (so it spills through that hole), and on another, the drinking valve feels there's something stuck in it (so you need to be a professional horn player to actually get any liquid out of it). On other ones - and this is pretty common - the 'hinge' of the drinking valve has gotten loose, which, again, leads to leaking.So, at this point, I have about 7 bottles, and only 2-3 working lids. If you could buy new replacement lids, this would be 5-stars, easy."
3,Takes getting used to!,"Overall, this is a good product. However, if you are used to drinking water out of a Poland Spring's bottle, and you drink a lot of it, then this product is going to be a bit tough for you. I like the fact that I am saving the environment, but the amount of water that comes out of the tip is minimal compared to taking a good sip out of the PS bottle. I am trying to get used to the smaller amount that comes out before I end up not using it at all! It is great, however, that it is leakproof...so no more spills in my car or my bag!"
2,sweats and is hard to drink water out of,"The sturdy construction is great but it sweats when you have ice in it and it is really hard to drink water out of it compared to our other water bottles that have really large open straws, so the main problem is that the bite valve needs to be much larger to be able to get more water out easily."
4,Camelbak Continues Hydration Tradition,"We were looking for BPA free bottles after the recent news articles about the chemical. This bottle is a great, cheaper option, than some of the steel bottles out there. You'll have to decide if the mouthpiece is for you. I have other Camelbak products, so I was familiar with the bite valve. My wife on the other hand doesn't really care for it. There is that slight ""plastic"" taste, but I tend to dribble on myself with the wide-mouth bottle, so this was a good option. All in all, a good bottle for the office or a lite day on the trail. It doesn't fit in a cupholder in our car. It's really close, though, it would have been nice if it were a little slimmer and a bit taller to accommodate."
2,Just don't use it with sunscreen or bug spray.,"This water bottle is great. It in unique with the mouth piece and straw, but it can't be used with sunscreen or bug spray on your hands. I just bought my wife a brand new one and after our first hik,e we put it in the dishwasher. She had used both OFF bug spray and Banana Boat sunscreen, and the bottle came out of the dishwasher with a cloudy film all over it. I called the warranty department and they told me that it is the only thing they have found that destroys the finish. The lady recommended that I not apply sunscreen or bug spray when using their product, or if I must to throughly wash my hands after applying. The warranty does not cover this type of incident. I don't know about you, but I usually use a camelbak for hiking outside where there are bugs and plenty of sun. Needless to say good idea for a product, but not the quality of a nalagene bottle."
2,Nice bottle but leaks...,"This bottle is a great size, color...looks good, but unless you keep that weird nipple thing on, it will squirt up the straw and leak on you! It also feels kind of weird sucking on the straw...like a baby bottle!"
2,Water pools at the top,"I've owned this bottle for about 6 months. Initially, I thought it was great since it leaked no more than the occasional drop. But recently, I've noticed that water pools at the top when sitting and gets everywhere when I go to reach for it. Also, I left the bottle in the cupholder of my car and when I returned found a large puddle below the bottle. I think that it is so airtight that the air inside the bottle expands when warming and the water is forced up the straw. Very annoying since I like to drink cold water that will eventually heat to room temperature."
3,Good but not great,"It's fairly nice but I'm not sure if I'd buy again. Mine leaks a little when laid on its side. I'm contemplating returning it, but that's probably not worth the effort."
4,CLEAN THE BITE VALVE OFTEN,"I love, love, love this product but was HORRIFIED when I pulled the bite value off to clean it and found black muck. I had cleaned the bottle and exterior of the value often, but in the 3 months I had been using the product, never pulled the plastic value off. OMG, it was disgusting. To think I was drinking out of that! Yuck! I've ordered a replacement bottle and will clean under the valve daily."
2,Wouldn't purchase again,"There are a couple reasons I would not buy this again. First off, having a flip top design means there are lots of crevices for dirt/dust to gather. It's nearly impossible to clean it properly because of that. Second, the tip cracked open making it impossible to suck up any liquid through it because the opening was so big. The bottle itself is pretty durable, that's about the only positive thing I can say about it. Otherwise, this just isn't a good design and I'd urge you to go with a klean kanteen, much better design and quality."
1,moosejaw logo turnoff,"I purchased this water bottle as a birthday gift for my nephew. Upon opening the box, I noticed a largelogo of ""Moosejaw"" stamped on the bottle.When you view the item for purchase, the logo is not shown and it would have been nice to see that before hand."
3,Hmmmm,"I love this bottle... except that it leaks. I've had friends get these bottles and they can be upside down/sideways, no problem. Mine can't. I've cleaned it, checked out the vent valve. No such luck."
3,Decent bottle,I really like this water bottle. It doesn't spill in my purse or backpack. Encourages me to drink more. The only downside I have found is you have to work to get the water out. Which is annoying when working out or trying to take medicine. Otherwise I would recommend this bottle.
4,Great water bottle,"Great alternative to plastic water bottles and bottled water. This is the same size as .5 L bottled water, so you can use those drink flavor packets, plus it has a built in straw so no tipping the bottle up to drink."
2,discoloration,"I bought 2 of these water bottles, a green and a blue one. I really like them over all. They open and close easily, the looks and feel nice. the build quality seems very high.However, the blue bottle is no longer clear, the outside is now ""frosted"" and looks like a kid with sticky fingers (after a doughnut or something) has been holding it. The green one is still prefectly clean and looks great. Each has gone though the same number of washings, and treated pretty much exactly the same."
2,the name must be selling this product,"Even though the product description said this would not leak, it did. It was purchased for a lunchbox water bottle. It left puddles in the lunchbox. Would not recommend. Very frustrating!"
3,"Thought I would like the new top, it came back to bite ME.",I paid around $10-15 for this bottle. It's nice I like the 1 liter option. My problem is the plastic at the base of the nipple broke after using it for about a week or two. The bottle wasn't exposed to anything harsh they may have caused this. It seems like poor quality plastic. I'm quite upset I'm going to have to spend another $7 to get a new top that won't leak.
4,awesome!,"I love this water bottle! I use it all of the time! Only 1 problem, it leaks if you turn it upside down."
5,Now have 2...love it that much,I bought the 32 oz. bottle and keep it at work. Love it so much...I bought a 24 oz bottle for home. Seems like I never get to use it at home. Somebody else is ALWAYS using it.
5,Great for kids!,My 2 1/2 year old son kept wanting to drink out of our 1.0 liter bottles...so we got him his own. He absolutely loves it!
5,Great water bottle,I love this water bottle. It is perfect for me. I love the no leak feature and the straw seems to hold up under lots of biting. Wish it were a little smaller at the bottom so it would fit into my car holder better. No complaints so far.
2,"Leaky, leaky, leaky!","So sad! I finally found the ""perfect water bottle"" for me, but it began to leak shortly after purchasing it. I have properly cared for it- never even put it in the dishwasher, yet it leaks! The air escape spot at the top seems to bubble up almost, and leak the fluid out all over. Bummer. I suppose my water bottle quest continues... :("
1,Poor design leaks no matter what.,"I ordered several of these and have the same problems with each one. The top somehow creates a vacuum and draws up water and actually bubbles up out of the bottle and floods my car's cup holder quite frequently. This happens no matter if the valve on top is left in an open or closed position. Very annoying and messy!! The bottles also leak whenever not kept strictly upright, and the plastic mechanism on top that open and closes can have one of the hinges broken pretty easily, which means the bottle leaks all over you every time you take a drink. I love the concept, but it just doesn't work."
2,great...for a while,"I have had a couple of these bottles and I've used them for a few years. The CamelBak concept works very well, but the problem comes after repeated use. Mildew builds up in the bite valve and in the plastic mechanism that holds the valve. It is very hard to clean because the mildew grows in areas that are too small to fit a brush or q-tip into. Soaking it in bleach doesn't work either. After a while the bottle becomes just plain unsavory. I've had to throw mine out and start over with a differently designed water bottle."
5,Wonderful Gift,This was a gift for my husband! He loves it. Great that you don't have to tilt it. You just flip and sip. I love that it is easy to clean. Dishwasher safe. My husbands friends all want one now.
5,great water bottle,Great water bottle. Switched from metal one. This definitly tastes better and is easier to use. Good size. Pretty aqua color.
5,Great Water Bottle!!,"My teenager carries this wherever she goes, and drinks tons of water now. She LOVES this bottle. The first one we received must have been defective - the valve part broke off after about a week. Amazon promptly replaced it for us at no charge. I would highly recommend this eco-friendly product!"
5,Fantastic for 2-year-olds and preschoolers!,"I bought two of these for my 2-year-old and 4-year-old. They're fantastic. I tried aluminum bottles but didn't like how they dented when dropped, and they were hard to clean. These bottles are BPA free, and leak-free even when the spout is in the up-and-drink position. This is wonderful! I was tired of baby sippy cups with too many pieces that were hard to clean, and straws that would eventualy rip and leak. These Camelbak straws are tough and bigger, therefore easier to clean. It took a little bit of practice for my 2-year-old to understand the ""bite and drink"" technique, but not long. I like that the straws go down for transport and stay clean, and the loop makes it easy to carry or clip onto a carabiner. And they also fit into the stroller cupholders, unlike some baby sippy cups. So for kiddos, I give these an A+."
5,Love these water bottles!,"I've been through a lot of water bottles. These are great for in the car, working out, anywhere. I haven't had the mildew problem in the spout that others have talked about. We bought 4!"
3,Plastic Lever Breakes Easily,The plastic lever on the bite valve broke off after I used it for about 6 months. I loved it until then! My girlfriend also had the same problem with hers.
5,Great Product,These bottles are the best bang for your buck. I have been using CamelBak products for years and they last long and work great.
5,Great,"It's a great bottle, at first I was reluctant with the bite valve but it has worked out just fine. If you are careful and wash it constantly you will have no problems. No complaints!"
4,Reusable,Like the bottle. Use it every day. i wish i would have ordered the one larger than this as I am forever refilling.
3,Not perfect,"I've owned three of these things and have taken them to the office as well as bicycling, hiking in the mountains, and motorcycling. The design is very thoughtful. Too bad they leak. Not at first, but after six months they could not be relied upon not to leak. The leaking seemed to originate around the diaphragm on the top of the bottle. It was especially pronounced after changing elevations in the mountains. One of the bottles was lying on its side and proceeded to leak all over an out of print book. For light use, they are probably okay, but do not trust them not to leak. I returned mine to REI and continue to search for a more reliable water bottle."
4,Works as designed,"Frankly, this is a great bottle. It does everything it says it was perfectly, and my girlfriend had me order her one she likes it so much. That said, it's not my favorite. If you're working out and trying to hydrate fast, the bite down top makes the flow of water slower than I can get with most bottles. I also personally like tipping the bottle over my head and I keep trying it with this one and getting nothing. For anyone without my specific preferences however, it probably deserves 5 stars."
2,Mouthpiece is worthless,"Mouthpiece broke in a matter of days, now it just leaks from the top. I recommend getting a bottle with just a simple, twist-off top."
2,"Great idea, but it leaks","I've had two. Both have developed leaks within a month of moderate use, so they've been relegated to desk duty."
5,Just what I needed!,This water bottle is perfect for me. It is well made and the ability to use the straw is very convenient. I will be sticking with Camelback!
4,Like them for my preschool age kids,"I first bought these water bottles for my 2 boys (4 & 5) about 1 1/2 years ago. For the most part I like them. They are BPA free and initially they did not leak. It seemed that after about a year, they started leaking a littlle around the valve. However, my kids do use them a lot. I looked around to see if there was a better option and I couldn't find one of this quality that would have been easy for my kids to use on their own with no assistance. I wanted a water bottle that was least like a ""sippy cup"" that they could use independently. I ended up buying 2 more recently to replace the original ones."
4,Great water bottle,I love my little purple CamelBak so much that I bought the .75L since the .5L isn't always large enough. It's especially handy when driving and fits in my cupholder. One warning: if you suffer from jaw pain you may find that using the bite valve exacerbates your jaw pain. I have intermittent jaw pain and on those days drinking from the CamelBak hurts.
5,Great water bottle,"Each of my 5 kids has their own color. They use them every day. We fill them up and use them in the car, throw them in duffel bags, or just leave them on the counter. They don't leak and you don't have to worry about the nasty plastic taste."
3,"Great Water Bottle!(Updated to ""Meh.."" status)","I received my 25oz water bottle about a week ago and I just love it! It has immediately helped me to intake more water on a daily basis and best of all I LOVE keeping it next to my bed at night; if I ever wake up thirsty I can reach over very tired and take a sip without any worry of spilling or there being dust in my drink or having to unscrew a bottle cap. Cheaply priced, lots of options for color and sizing, bite down straw and made by Camelbak...need I say more?Had to update my review to 3 stars because after the first two weeks or so it began to leak from the base of the drinking spout any time it was on its side in my pack, and about 2 months after I bought I pulled out the drinking spout and it just popped right off. That was the end of that."
4,"Spillproof + Durability grat, but hard to clean.","The valve portion gets water ""stuck"" and if you don't use it regularly the wet get must and nearly impossible to clean. I ended up soaking the whole lid in vinegar water overnight while periodically flipping the nozzle part back anf fourth, before I could get rid of the smell."
5,great water bottle,I love this bottle it is great. I like knowing it is non toxic and it just works very well. You can have it full and lay it down and it doesn't leak at all.
1,hard to use,"I bought this ""Bite valve"" type a few months ago - worst decision. It is very hard to use, I can never get enough water out to quench my thirst. I HIGHLY recommend going with the pressure/ jet valve type (CamelBak Podium Bottle) instead. Much easier to use and it has a locking feature."
1,Ew.,"I bought this water bottle for work. It's not too bad, the squeeze and suck takes a little to get used to. BUT it broke easily, the little handle to pull up the bite valve broke very easily. And then the GROSS part. The bite valve got MOLDY. I tried to keep it dry, but it is not easy at all. I will not be buying this again."
3,"Okay, but bite valve is hard on dental work","The bottle is nice enough, but if you have crowns, or any other dental work or issue on your front top or bottom teeth, biting the valve can be difficult if not uncomfortable. Even if I didn't have crowns, I found it annoying anyway. Like the other reviewer said also, because of the rubbery nature of the bite valve, lint, hair and other stuff tends to stick to it. I just didn't think it was worth the money, personally. I can see how it might be really good for kids, especially if you're traveling, to avoid spilling."
5,I'm bringin sexy CamelBak...,"Don't be a sexual camel, or water-drinking camel...get a flippin CamelBak and drink up all day long without spillin it on your fresh new hemp tee.BPA-Free or DIE!"
1,Too loud,"My bottle makes a really loud noise when I try to get any water. It is like there is a leak somewhere, because in addition to the sound there is a very small volume of water that comes through. The sound is like a cross between a squeal and the sound your straw makes in the bottom of a nearly-empty cup of soda. And this is when the bottle's full.So, if I had it to do over again I would not buy this for these reasons:Too loudDoes not suck up a lot of water for the effort expendedWon't fit in my car's cup holderFungus grows in the bite valve easilyBut mainly I don't like the sound. I can't drink this thing in work meetings or in class at school. I can't drink it when I'm watching a movie with friends."
4,"Great water bottle, but not perfect","I really enjoyed using this water bottle, and it's perfect except for the mouthpiece. It can grow fungus, which is disgusting, and I had to replace it. Not a very hygienic bottle, but otherwise very nice to use. I like how it closes the nozzle completely, pinching it so no spills occur."
1,Hate the bite valve,Wish I would of realized this was not the same camelbak water bottle that I had for years the standard pull up nozzle. Unfortunately I misplaced it. The bite nozzle is awkward. I hate it!
2,Loses novelty fast - creates jaw ache,"Novelty of leak proof mouth piece and no need of inverting bottle to drink fades quickly when the bite piece is too hard to clean in the inside to give piece of mind, discolors, and creates jaw ache b/c the mouth piece is tough and you have to continuously bite down to get a continuous flow of water. And after about a month of use, one hinge of the mouth piece broke causing an awkward flipping of the mouth piece. Not very sanitary as you're constantly touching the mouth piece to flip it on/off.If you're looking for a BPA-free water bottle that is ergonomically designed, consider the KOR water bottles. That's what I switched to and am super happy with it.[...]"
3,Not the greatest,"I think in the back of my mind I thought Camelbak products where the end all in this kind of product line. So I bought it without reading any comments. Well, all the comments about the leaking are true! It's very annoying. I bought this to take with me on hikes as well as for the office. And when you are partially distracted by your work and you reach to take a drink and spill water all over yourself its really frustrating! I also didn't realize that the spout cover was suppose to stay on, but why would you want to bite it to get water? And it stains if you happen to enjoy the occasional tomato soup....Will not buy another."
1,dirty nozzle,"one nnoying feature about this product is that dirt seems to collect in the nozzle, promoting bacteria growth. it is very hard to clean that nozzle as a finger can barely fit in there as well. im glad im drinking water more but could be less worried about bacteria collection"
3,Could be better,"I'm not sold on the nipple design. When I'm on a bike and I'm thirsty I want to flood my mouth with water quickly, not bite the nipple and suck a little at a time. If you need long, slow hydration then it's fine."
4,Great bottle!,"I had been looking for something like this but was having a hard time finding a large one. I bought the largest size (32 oz I think) and use it daily. It's well made, durable. The only problem is that you need to buy the special CamelBak bottle cleaner to thoroughly wash it. I went ahead and bought the cleaner later to keep it from getting moldy."
2,Good for first 6 months...,"This water bottle was great for the first six months or so. I used and washed it regularly. After six months or so, I noticed black fungus looking material in the bite valve, which was only visible when I held it up to light. This bacteria was impossible to remove... so I trashed it."
3,Good Water Bottle with Expensive Replacement Parts,"I wanted to love the Camelbak water bottle, but I just can't because of the ""maintenance"" fees. The bite valve seems relatively sturdy unless it's bitten through or lost. A replacement bite valve costs almost as much as the bottle itself. And the bottle can't be used without the bite valve.Also, I experienced some water leakage (by going up the straw)when the bottle was stored in a hot car.With all that said, it's great to have a water bottle that uses a straw. I've noticed that you can spend another 6 bucks on a cap, maybe that would help with the leaking problem. Personally, I think it should be sold with the bottle!"
5,CamlBak 1 litre BPA-Free Bottle,"This bottle will exceed you expectations. I use it for my workouts, carrying around at school, and using at the Sauna at the local pool. Mine does not leak, but I read that others have had problems with leakage, I've owned it for a few months now, and no leak, so hopefully none to come. Fantastic bottle at a good price. Thanks Camelbak"
4,Good product,This is a good water bottle if you like the straw setup. It would be nice to have a clip to attach it to a belt.
4,Excellent bottle!,"What I love about this bottle is that it's dish-washer safe - no cleaning tablets necessary. If anyone out there has any questions about this bottle, just go to Camelbak's web site and they explain how you can take it apart to fit in the top rack of your dishwasher.I put an ""S"" hook on the handle bar of my push mower so I could hang this bottle from it when I mow. It also fits in my car cup holder. I bought two - one for work and one for home but my jealous husband snagged one for himself.I have never had a problem getting a sufficient amount of liquid from the bite valve, nor have I had any leaking problems. Very happy!"
2,I really wanted to love this bottle,"I did. I've used it for a couple of weeks now, and while the bottle is lightweight, BPA free, has a great little handle for carrying around, and doesn't leak, I can't get past the straw. I drink 3 liters of water a day, and by noon my jaw is so sore from the effort to bite and drink, it's just not worth it. It may just be me. I don't chew gum either because my jaw can't take the effort. So if you don't have that problem, then this bottle is for you. If you are like me, though, and you have a sensitive jaw joint, then I'd look for a different solution."
1,"""Spill-proof"" bottle is anything but","While the description clearly states it is ""spill-proof,"" my bottle had a steady leak coming from underneath the bite valve. It leaked whether or not the valve was clicked open or closed. My reason for purchasing this item was so I could throw it in my purse and have it on the go, but that's not possible with how quickly this leaks (without making a mess, course). I also didn't care for the bite valve and the amount of water that would come out of it. It felt similar to drinking from a water fountain, where you just can't get enough water in one sip. Overall, I was very disappointed in the quality of this bottle, especially since I've always heard such good things about this particular model. I suppose if you don't plan to have the bottle on its side at all, and you don't prefer having larger swigs of water, you might like this."
3,"Like the bottle, but mold is an issue","Like the other users, I found mold in the tube and all around the cap (including the bite piece and all inside the sealing parts).While it's not a big deal to clean the tube and bite piece, it's difficult to clean the rest of the ares inside the cap. I've used a toothbrush, cotton swabs, etc, but it won't completely clean the cap's inside nooks and crannies. Otherwise, I'd rate this bottle 4.5/5 or even higher.FYI, I usually use it to hold Gatorade mix for playing sports. Mold seems to grow w/in a week or so of use if I leave an emptied bottle for a couple of days w/o rinsing it. I try to remember to rinse after each use, but sometimes one just forgets."
1,Substandard,"I owned two of these bottles. The first one fell 16 inches off a bench and the lever that moves the bite valve broke clean off. It also contantly leaked around the seals when full of water and tilted on its side. Every time I'd throw in a backpack or gym bag my gear would come out wet. The second one leaks the same way the first one does. Probably the safest way to use it is sitting undisturbed on a desk or table. Face it, there's cheaper and more effective cups and glasses on the market."
4,Great gym bottle,"This is my 3rd camelbak, and it's a really nice one. Holds a lot of water, and the handle is nice for picking up during a workout. You can easily drink with one hand, which is another plus. I've had my first one for about 2 years and it's held up well, even through some drops. The only negative is that is does leak if you turn it upside-down, so be careful in your gym bag or purse!"
2,good staff but can't last long,My daughter used it for 3 months. She liked it. But the flip part broke. We had to throw it away. Wish it could last longer.
3,It broke in 2 weeks.,The plastic bit below the mouthpiece broke within 2 weeks of normal wear and tear. Shipping was quick but the product ended up being a disappointment.
2,"""Spillproof"" ?!","""Spillproof"" bottle leaks every time. If you're looking for a bottle that you'll feel safe leaving in you pack, setting on the seat of your car or leaving any other place where it will not be stored 100% upright at all times, look elsewhere.This ""spillproof"" bottle is anything but. Have gone through 3 of these (under impression first 2 were defective). The bottles are not defective, just defectively designed and marketed. All 3 have leaked all over my pack, car, etc...No point in paying extra for the ""spillproof"" lid if it doesn't work as advertised."
3,Leaks,"I purchased this bottle because of all of the good reviews, but it leaks more than my old Rubbermaid. It seems that water gets caught in the bite cover, and then leaks out when you least expect it. Bottle is OK otherwise, but the leaking is really annoying me. It happens more often after I fill it. It is, however, sleek looking and attractive, and overall serves it's purpose."
4,great fitting bottle,"This is a great water bottle for the gym, it fits in every holder and you can drink it fast with the straw. It is completely leak proof. It works great for me. It is on the small size, but I wouldnt change anything."
3,There are better!,"I purchased 2 of these to bring with me to work each day. When I found out they needed to be cleaned with special tablets, I wasn't impressed. As long as one is aware that the bottle needs extra cleaning attention (whether you use the tablets or not, the mouth piece needs special attention to cleaning so you dont get fungus or micro-organisms), then you will be pleased. As for me, I will go back to using my regular sports bottles because they take less time to clean."
1,Great if water stayed IN the bottle,"This is a great bottle except the water does NOT stay in the bottle. ANY change in temperature, altitude or for really no reason at all water comes up the spout and pours all over the car, my clothes, important papers, etc. Not just a little trickle either, a LOT of water. It really is a nice bottle, too bad they didn't do just a little more R&D. This is definitely a reason I won't use this bottle."
5,I Love These Water Bottles!,"I thought I really loved my cheap Wal*Mart water bottles until I received one of these. Not only are they attractive, they are very efficient. The bottom doesn't quite fit in the cup holder in my car, but it is absolutely spill-proof, and I am able to lay it down on the passenger seat without a drop leaking out, even with the valve in the open position! The bite valve is a little odd, sort of a glorified adult sippy cup, but it definitely doesn't ruin the product. I loved my purple one so much, I had to get another."
5,Good!,The item came fast and was in perfect condition! It was hassle free and would buy again if i had to
3,Tastes like plastic,"I have a reverse osmosis water treatment machine in my house and now have delicious water. When I used the bottle for the first time, after washing it, the water I sipped from the bottle tasted strongly of plastic. Hopefully this off-taste will lessen and stop. Since I bought this bottle in two different sizes, I desperately hope it stops. On the positive side, so many bottles I have purchased in the past leak. So far, these bottles do not leak."
2,Constant leaks,"I have two of these purchased a year apart and they both leak if not kept upright. I bought a second when i noticed the first was leaking when i began to put it in a desk drawer. I figured 'hey its old' and bought a new one, which leaked the first day.I actually love these bottles, but wish they didnt leak so much water."
4,Very good,"Just what I needed, only thing I didn't realize was that the bottom is sort of graduated, i.e. gets bigger as it goes down, presented a problem to me because i usually carry it in the outer pocket of my backpack, but eventually got it to fit. Works perfectly, I love camelback water bottles!"
3,Not so Fantastic any more!,"It's a bottle...It holds water and ( wait for it)....... you can drink from it. I love this thing. No leaking yet, I have run it through the dishwasher a few times as well. If you are looking for a good quality water bottle, but are hesitant to spend a little extra, just bite the bullet and do it. I have had many others from various outfitters and none compare to what I have here.Update: This bottle has become unusable. No matter what I do I cannot get an adequate amount of water out of it. I have replaced the bite valve and straw with no luck. Even if I try to suck the water out of the hard plastic opening that the bite valve goes on the results are the same. I left to think that something is defective within the lid, but you cannot find those on amazon. I bought my wife the same bottle(pink)and the flow of water in hers is 100 times better than mine ever was. Very disappointed, amazon needs to sell the replacement cap, not just straws and bite valves."
5,awesome!,This is hands down the best water bottle I've ever used. It's very high quality and holds water tightly without leaks.
3,"It's ok, but....","I like this bottle. Well, I want to like this bottle. But, the design engineer who threw the cap together should be scolded.The bottle does indeed leak. It's not at the actual bite valve, but under it. The small gap under the bite valve retains the liquid from the last time you turned the bottle upside-down, forcing it into the valve when you bring it out and retract it.I recommend using the straw that it came with, but I believe those who have rated this 3 stars or lower do it for the sake of that darn little gap that pours little spurts of water all over your face, pants, and shirt. Cool bottle design though! Drink 2.5 of this bottle's water amount of water amount per day for a great amount of hydration."
5,Pink Camelbak,The item was shipped in a very prompt manner. It was sent in the proper condition as described and would highly recommend this product!
2,Can't replace broken parts.,"I bought 3 of these for my kids. They need something clear so they can see how much water they have left and something they can't easily spill. These aspects of the bottle are great. Unfortunately, out of the 3, we have a broken bite valve (understandable with kids), a broken tab that's used to flip up the bite valve, and a broken hinge for flipping up the bite valve. If they sold replacement tops and at a reasonable price, it wouldn't be so bad, but I haven't located anything other than bite valves & straws. Maybe I'll check out Nalgene."
2,Lousy bottle that leaks all the time.,I bought this bottle so that I wouldn't have to buy those disposable plastic bottles of water. Paid [...] bucks for it. From day 1 it would leak all over my purses and backpack. In fact I usually just fill it up half way so I don't have to deal with it. I don't recommend getting this. Waste of money.
1,Why,"Cant last a month. Hard too clean. Plastic bottled water tastes better. Bite piece gets very moldy, hard to clean place. Suggest drinking from a water filtered pitcher."
5,Great,The product shipped and arrived quickly. I love the bottle itself. I would definitely call it more of a blue than a gray. Very happy!
3,Works great on the bike,"I bought this for use on bike rides. I am not a big fan of the back-pack style ""hydration solutions"", so this was a good fit. Unlike other water bottles, I can drink from this one without tilting my head up, which can get dangerous when riding. The 0.75L bottle just barely fits into the standard-size bottle holder on the bike; definitely a snug fit. I tried the 1.0L version, but it was too big to fit into the holder."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed that after one week, part of the spout broke off making it difficult to open. For that price I expected it to be more durable."
3,It's OK. Does What it says it does.,"I got this particular size and color for my grandson to encourage him to drink water. This bottle does what it says, it's convenient to the average cup holder size (which is great) and it does not spill. As I got a different size and model with the same ""sipping"" mechanism, what I don't like is the fact that you literally have to bite & suck on the outer straw to drink from this. I'm sure that the constant gnawing on this will wear it out. I didn't think this was a big deal until I got it. Now, it's just weird and annoying for me. However, my grandson (9yrs) thinks it's great. He can prove how much water he drank and would get in trouble when his little brother (1-1/2yrs) knocks it over.Overall, it's a good product that performs as advertised."
4,Nice,I am always in the search for the perfect water bottle.. lol.. i know my husband makes fun of me.. i thought this one might be it.. it is nice.. but if you have a bit of TMJ like me.. it hurts a little bit when you are drinking alot.. you have to bite the blue plastic spout to get water out.. i just find it is a little bit hard.. but it seems to be getting better as i use it longer.. other than that it is good.
5,I love this water bottle!,"If you are thinking about a refillable bottle, i would get this one; It is durable, attractive and the valve works well once you get the hang of it. the only drawback is the straw which i removed because if you don't you can't tip the bottle to drink from- i found that unnatural. I do get left with a small resevoir of water at the bottom that i need to unscrew the lid to drink though."
4,The Perfect Water Bottle,I have been trying to find a BPA free water bottle that had a built-in straw and this one is perfect. I really dislike having to tilt my head back to get a drink. It's especially irritating when driving the car or bicycling. With this bottle I don't have to take my eyes off the road to satisfy my thirst.Good product!
5,The BEST water bottle,"This Camelbak water bottle is the most valuable purchase I've ever made on Amazon. It cost about $15 with shipping but it was so worth it. The bite valve straw allows you to drink with one or even no hands at times! Some people have complained about the bite valve being hard to use but it just takes about a day to get used to. It also doesn't leak which is important for bottles with straws. I can't recommend this bottle enough. It's the easiest, most handy water bottle out there."
5,The best water bottle,"I have three Moosejaw Camelbak water bottles. I use them everyday, wether exercising,driving, or out shopping.The ""straw"" to drink from is so much more convenient, and so much safer as you drive.(the only way to drink and Drive!!!)"
4,Ideal!,"Travel, working-out, staying-in...... all-purpose water bottle. Psychologically I keep drinking more water since the time I started using this bottle. The only drawback would be that the straw is a tad bit thin and I wish it was 2 sizes bigger in width. All-in-all, good buy!"
4,Incomplete information in Amazon description,"Yes, this is a 1 liter, blue, PBA free water bottle, but they don't tell you on Amazon not to use carbonated beverages in it. And that's how I start my day. It would cost too much in shipping to send it back, so I'll use it as a water bottle, not as an oversize mug."
1,YUCKY TASTE,"I was excited to get this but after leaving it in my car the bite valve has a terrible taste. It goes away if I wash the valve, but in TN summers a hot car is inevitable, so this has not been a good product for me. It's a nice design and I'd like it except for that major issue."
1,Water Under the Bridge,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this water bottle. It's uncomfortable to carry and difficult to drink from. There are many better products ... many at better prices. Bought one for my wife as well and she used it two or three times before discarding it.
1,It might be BPA free BUT....,It might be BPA free but its made of #7 plastic which is known to cause cancer. I figured that out today. Additionally it does not fit in my car cup holder and after 2 weeks of typical use its very scuffed and dull looking. I just tossed it into the recycle bin and am waiting for my new aluminum Oggi bottles to arrive.
1,Tastes Like A Fish Tank No Matter How Many Times You Wash It!!!!,"Worst bottle ever. Worst company to deal with ever. I wouldn't use this bottle if it came with it's own Rolex. Pretty much imagine holding your eyeball open and having someone dump kitty litter into it. That's what this bottle is to me. A nightmare. A product that needs to be taken off the market. I'm pretty sure a baby could choke on this thing so somebody get on that... Don't buy it. In fact when you finish reading this, just email them something nasty and told them i sent you."
1,i would never expect such a freak bottle,It makes drinking tiring! You have to keep on biting it hard if you wanna drink. Jeez.I guess my puppy would like the design.
1,Not happy :(,I had an identical Camelbak water bottle that I loved! It was stolen so I immediately bought a new one on Amazon. This one is horrible. Its like trying to drink a thick milkshake through a straw. I would really like to return it but obviously I've already opened it. I work out and need more water flow in my water bottle. I am very disappointed and will be needing another new water bottle.
1,Leaky moldy mess,"My husband bought a bunch of these bottles a while back. Ever since, I only seem to experience disappointments with these bottles. Maybe they could have been great if they first could hold the water in. The only way; keep them straight. Not easy in a backpack or in a car!Then it was for the straw to go; everyone in my family stopped using them. I guess we all graduated from sippy cups a long time ago.But the worse of all is the mold. After using them a few times, the rubber tops get really moldy inside; and when drinking sports drinks, the mold seems to grow instantly. So, we replaced those. Then (if you use them), the straws also end up getting moldy inside. And now it's the air valves that are all moldy. And cleaning these assures your bottle to always leak. If the other problems didn't already, this one definitely pushed me over the top!"
1,straw is terrible = bottle is terrible,"The straw was atained a bright yellow AFTER JUST ONE USE, drinking gatorade out of it. Washing it didn't remove it. Maybe they should make the straw black next time. Also, the straw doesn't stay in place well. This bottle is not good."
2,Don't like the drinking valve,"I straw works well in this bottle, and I like the handle on the top, but I really dislike the valve to drink out of. It's too big. I took the rubber piece off, which helps, but now the drinking piece is a bit short and is hard plastic."
2,wouldn't buy it again,"The major problem with this bottle is that it leaks around the mouthpiece. As long as you carry it upright, you are fine, but when it gets tilted, the water seeps out (trashing whatever else you are carrying in your backpack). Also, the ""bite valve"" is made out of rubber snugly fitting around a plastic tube. Unless you scrub it thoroughly after each use, I bet it will very quickly become a breeding ground for all sorts of creatures... yuck!!!Don't buy it."
5,Nalgene gotz Competition,"Purchased this bottle a last month and I love it. I use it whenever I go to the gym or class. I have dropped this bottle plenty of times and it has not cracked. It is also easy to drink out of whenever I use a stepmaster machine. Dont have to worry about opening the entire cover, just lift the drinking tube with a finger and sip. Speaking of one finger, it also features a plastic loop on the cover that makes it easy to carry."
4,New nifty sippy cup- good for kids and grownups,I generally like my blue Camelbak water bottle. A little different to have to press/bite on the rubber spout though- takes getting used to. We've found that the spout does leak a little- but it's only a few drops of water so no big deal. It's great for in-car use for my kids- no tipping water bottles up and drenching themselves. Also the bottle seems to be sturdy and we like the little handle. Worked well for us this summer. Only gripe is that it's too big to fit in the front cup holders of our Odyssey. It does fit the drop down holders of the middle row.
5,These things are amazing!,"Bought this as a gift for my sister, because I had a blue one(not lying, promise ;p). It's the most convenient water bottle there is, and you should stop polluting the earth with plastic and switch to a no-BP, comfortable, and easy camel-tube water bottle. The nipple-thing makes water drinking like...being born!"
2,Leaks,Worked great for a few months but now it leaks. I always hand washed it and took care of it but I don't use it very much anymore because I can't throw it into my bag.
2,"would be great, but. . .","this looks like a quality product. but i just can't get the bite valve down. when i try to use it hardly any water comes out, and i get strangled on my own spit. not good. oh well-"
2,broken valve,"I've had four of these bottles in the last year, three of which have had the hinge pegs on the valve break off. It seems that if you don't close the valve before screwing on (or off) the lid there is a high likelihood of torquing the valve to the point of breaking a peg. Its replaceable... if you can find parts."
4,Fluid intake success.,"I ordered this water bottle for myself to bring to work.So far, it is a fantastic carrier of hydrating liquids, and has not failed me yet. It does sweat a little bit, but it keeps water cold for a while. It holds enough to keep me satiated until lunch, during which I refill the bottle and throw it in the freezer to chill that water down.My only complaint (which isn't so much of one) is that the bite valve is sorta awkward to use. For one thing, it doesn't deliver fluid quickly for optimal imbibing....and the time it takes to get enough liquid makes it look like you're sucking on a adult bottle to other people.That being said, I'm fairly happy with this water bottle. I mean, it has a fairly simple task--carry water. Camelbak achieved this task well."
3,"Good, but...","The bottle is great, the sipping mechanism is good, but the spout won't stay in the down and locked position. It pops up and is liable to leak."
5,Love Camelbak!,I LOVE my Camelbak water bottle! It's so easy to drink out of and doesn't ever leak. All the color choices are nice too. I now have both red and black. :)
2,bottle leaks,"I purchased 2 of these water bottles, I loved them until the water comes back up and leaks. Not happy with that and not my favorite water bottle.Would not recommend for purchase."
2,Hard to clean - don't use juice,Since my initial review I have bought a couple more of these bottle. I had bought one of these that I would use for my two year old. This bottle is a great water bottle but if you use juice . . . just don't unless you want to go through a lot of effort to clean it. I would change the stars up to maybe three or four now that I have been using it as just a water bottle but I wasn't able to.
3,bite valve ripped,"I felt compelled to write my first review. I bought 2 bpa-free better bottles about 1 month ago for my 2 sons, ages 4 and 6. They were drinking out of plastic straw cups and wanted to switch over to a more adult cup with a straw like mechanism. We loved them! They didn't leak, were fun to use, and relatively easy to clean. However, over the last few days I noticed they were leaking. Upon inspection, the bite valve is splitting/ripping on each end so now water flows freely out the valve. This happened in both cups! I was going to replace them but then I realized I will be spending $6 every month on each cup to replace the valves. I usually wash them by hand and have only put them in the dishwasher a few times.I looked through the reviews and haven't seen anyone else with this problem. I may use try to use the cup without the valve."
3,CamelBak 1 Liter,I really like the water bottle except the second week I had it I dropped it on pavement and the circular part of the plastic on the bottom cracked and started leaking. I fixed it with epoxy but I'm sure the structural integrity of the bottle would be compromised in the event that it is dropped again.
3,simple and great,"I like this bottle because it is simple and bpa free. but I don't like the straw mouthpiece because it makes the water flow too slowly and makes it quite hard to clean it thoroughly. Other than that, its a great bottle and water did not leak at all."
4,Great water bottle,This water works great and doesn't leak at all. It's great for school and to use throughout my day. The only downside is when I play sports I have to take the lid off in order to take larger/quicker drinks of water so I usually end up using a Nalgene bottle.
5,The ideal water bottle,"Sturdy, drip-free, easy-to-clean, BPA-free, easy-to-sip, this water bottle has it all. I wouldn't bother with anything else when looking for a large capacity water bottle."
4,Excellent water bottle,"I love this water bottle! I was searching specifically for a BPA-free bottle that I could bring to work and this one works great. The only downside is that the spout is a little hard to bite, which is required to get the water out. On the other hand, it is completely spill-proof which is important to me since I can't afford to spill water on my computer. Less important, but nice is that the colors are bright and fun. I find that it is easy to drink from once I've bitten the spout. This size is perfect - it fits in my car cupholder and in my bags without a problem. I would definitely buy this bottle again."
5,Love these waterbottles,I have 3 of these water bottles in different sizes. I love them. FYI you can take off the bite valve to clean it.
5,Very durable and easy to clean,"I love these bottles and have had three so far. The bite valve is comfortable, the bottles are durable, they come in a variety of fun colors, and they are easy to throw into a dishwasher. I take one with me every where to keep hydrated and help myself to remember to drink water often."
5,Love My Bottle,"Kids had one, thought it looked cool. Glad I tried it. It is so convienent. Tke it everywhere I go."
2,Bite valve is easily broken.,"The water bottle is fine itself, but even through casual use the hinge which connects and allows the swing of the bite valve and the bottle is already broken. I have used mine for about 1.5 months and it already broke when trying to take off the plastic bite part for cleaning."
2,They Leak!,"I have had about 5 of these bottles, but have come to breaking point with them.I go to the gym allot so pack them in my gym bag only discover they have leaked throughout the bag unless positioned upright.The leak comes through the valve, to which you might also notice if you are shaking the bottle to mix anything in it.CamelBak claims they are leak free and dishwasher safe, this is not the case brand new bottle once through the dishwasher prior to use....leaks like a sieve."
1,"Good Product, terrible customer service","Defective lid so I requested a replacement, they give you no reply or follow up, and then 2 weeks later the wrong replacement part arrives.. .what a joke.. .These are good bottle but they are not cheap and the service sucks.. ."
2,Complicated design and fragile,The spout broke very early on in it's life. The parts can't be replaced due to the design of manufacture. I fix almost everything in the house one way or another but the cap is not a repairable part. Machines build them in certain ways that a human hand can't do. Plus - the parts are too fragile. The plastics need to be a more resilient or softer blent to resist cracking and breaking.
1,Don't like the bite valve.,"I realize that I'm in the minority with this review and most people seem to really like the bottle, but my husband and I hate it. I like a simple water bottle (BPA-free of course). I wish that I looked closer at this bottle before buying it. This is definitely not for me."
1,"The bottle is great, the ad not so much.","The item shows a clean bottle, but in real life it has stickers on it. If you're going to sell something, be honest about it's condition."
1,BROKEN,"VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED. Top was broken when I received, one of the knob ends that rotates the nipple out was busted. to much hassle to send back. still works but will tip to the side. ANNOYING.."
2,Disapointed,"Purchased this water bottle just after Christmas, and it's leaking. Contacted both the seller and camel back, as camel back bottles are guaranteed. I have not gotten a response from either. Ordinarily these are great bottles, and I think we just got a bad one."
1,Great Idea but Disappointed in Quality and Design,"Work great for a while then the part that holds the bite value broke. Camelbac sent me a free lid but then a month later it broke again. It also doesn't fit in car holders. It is very difficult to keep clean and if you have a clear bite value others can see the build up of scum in the bottle, yuck! There is just too many pieces to have things go wrong with. The bite value if you are not very carefully when cleanly can tear. Also don't leave this water bottle in your car. If you do you will have water spilled in your car. As the water or liquid heats up in the straw it forces its way out through the bite valve and will leave you a mess. It is also is prone to leaking as we found out when we bought the smaller version for our 2 year old. Don't waste your money."
3,not my fav,"With a change in temperature the liquid comes squirting out of this every time you open it. It is also not insulated very well, so it sweats, and doesn't stay cold. For the price they need to come up with a better design. It also doesn't fit into a normal car cup holder."
2,Scuffed Scratched,"I'm extremely dissatisfied. The bottle was extremely scuffed and scratched up, this is unexceptable as it is a gift. I love the Camelbak, but am not satisfied with the quality."
1,Do Not Buy The Bottle. Period.,"After about 6 months of use, I'd had repeated problems with this bottle leaking. Curious to know if others experienced this problem, I went to Amazon. Not only did others talk about leakage/spillage, they also alerted me to a mold problem. I immediately got up, went to the kitchen and held the drinking valve up to the light. Well.. LO AND BEHOLD. With a small spoon I scooped out a black, murky substance from the plastic tip that you DRINK from. Can anyone spell yuck? The leaking was a terrible problem; however, finding this murky substance in the drinking spout (how on earth did I not see it before???) was enough to cause me to take these bottles (I have two) out to the dumpster. I wish I'd made a video of me scooping the gunk out of the spout."
1,Anybody helps me get rid of mold inside the straw?,"I loved this bottle so much that I have been using it every single day - for school, work, and gym. But today I found mold over the inside of the straw!!! I was trying to get rid of it, but since the straw is so narrow, I could not do a thorough job. I always wash the bottle, the straw, etc. every night and leave them dry. Has anybody had the same experience? I still like the bottle very much since it is the ideal size and I found it easy to drink. But, I also don't like the idea that I am drinking water through the straw full of mold..."
4,"Great bottle, but size matters","This is a great water bottle. I do have one issue with it in that it is too tall. I have a faucet mounted water filter and I have to tilt this bottle to fill it under the faucet, which means I can't really fill it all the way. The bottle is just a tad too tall. It's top-rack dishwasher safe, but again, it's a little tall and will only fit in my top-rack if I place it just right. I like the way the bottle works though and have ordered the 0.75 L and 0.50 L versions for use in other situations where I don't need a full 1.0 L. Great bottle, but size matters!"
1,"Moldy, Leaky Straw","I loved the bottle when I first purchased it. I loved the fact that I could throw the bottle in my purse and not have to worry about it leaking. But after a couple months of use, I noticed that bottle began to leak if it was not upright. I also noticed that mold began to grow inside the straw. Due to the design of the straw piece, it is near impossible to ensure that the inside of the straw is actually clean and free of bacteria each time you attempt to wash it. I will be replacing my two Bite Valve CamelBak bottles for the old fashion screw cap bottle. I do wish that there was some kind of protective cap we could put on the mouthpiece. There were several instances where my bottle fell over into the grass/dirt, leaving the straw useless."
2,Make certain you keep it upright,"In theory, this bottle should have worked well for me. I drink water all day and have several water bottles. I thought this looked like a good addition to my collection, but it didn't work too well.The bottle is durable, fits well in cup holders, and looks nice. My complaint is that mine leaks from the cap where it screws on. Every time I'd have this bottle in my gym bag, my items would get wet. Thank goodness I only had water in it.I find drinking out of the bottle to be a bit awkward. The blue bite valve on the cap is somewhat similar to a baby bottle nipple only with a larger opening (this is what felt awkward to me and I could barely get water out of it).The bottle works, but just make certain to keep it upright and not lean it on its side or your items might get wet like mine. Hopefully my bottle was just defective and they are not all that way."
2,Nothing great.,"I received this water bottle as a gift in the middle of December. I use it about every day, and the bite valve is already getting a tear in the side, and it leaks-really bad! Also, if I want to drink out of it, I have to tip the bite valve almost all the way to the handle. It's really annoying, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Excellent Water Bollte,"Been using the water bottle for over year now, and I been a satisfying using product. I bring my bottle to the Gym every time."
3,Camelbak Better Bottle,"I don't like the plastic taste of the silicone mouth piece. YUCK!!! this is great for longer outings, the wide mouth make it easy for adding ice, and the clip is convienent."
5,fantastic.,"This is easily the best water bottle I've bought. and I've bought quite a few, from Nalgene, to aluminum bottles, to the Eddy Bauer ones, this beats them all. the only time this has ever leaked is when I got some sand in the release valve up in the top of the bottle, and that was cured by rinsing it off. This bottle is indestructible, it got mold in the bite valve, and thought the end was near, but nope, a visit to Camelbak's website told me the just take off the bite valve, and rinse it out, this worked perfectly, no more mold! also if the straw ever starts getting loose on the fitting, just put it in some boiling water, and it'll go back to it's normal shape. overall, this is a great bottle, it never leaks and is very tough."
2,Leaky,"When I first got this bottle I LOVED it. It's very convenient to have a straw, so you don't have to tip the bottle up every time you want a drink.But, now I'll never want to buy another one.Why?Because they leak.If you can't toss a water bottle into a backpack and go for a hike what good is it??Near the end of my bottles life I had to baby it, constantly checking on it, ensuring it was always upright and leak free. Because as soon as I was turned sideways it would start leaking water onto everything else. Cameras, phones, coats, gloves, your backpack, your back. So I ditched it.Also, If I left the water in the straw it had a funny taste after an hour or so. My friend didn't think so, so maybe I'm more sensitive to it than other but it's something to think about.My advice? Only buy if you're using it around the home and don't mind/notice a bit of plastic taste from the straw."
3,Spills Water,"Not very happy with this product. I fill it with water and ice, then close. I then reopen , say 5 minutes later, and water always splashes all over me. Not a very good product. Also, does not fit in any of my car cup holders."
1,IT LEAKS! Mine does anyway.,"I bought this as a replacement for my beloved lost nalgene. It took some warming up to as I'm a rather sentimental person, but when I finally decided it was a keeper and came to fully appreciate the awesomeness of not having to stop every time I want to drink water, the stupid thing started leaking everywhere. I have two purses now that are soaked. I don't know what the deal is. It started leaking right after I had wiped off some buildup of lip-goop and who-knows-what, so apparently maybe my own gross sloughed off cells were plugging whatever hole is the culprit? Anyway, apparently it has excellent reviews from most, but just be aware that it could leak, and leak a lot."
2,Nay...,"It's difficult to clean the bite valve, and therefore you should think of getting it replaced rather than cleaning it. If you're going to get it get the one with classic cap. I have one in lime color and grey color. Personally I regret buying the lime colored one, it looks hideous."
2,Not the best for kids,"I'll be back to THERMOS the next round of water bottles. I wanted to try a new water bottle for my kids, something a little more mature for them, yet easy to use. This is not the ideal product for them. It will leak if the valve is not secured down properly. That's asking a little much from my 5 year old to tell the difference. I couldn't even tell the difference, but found that when I firmly put the valve down it worked. I don't have much hope for this thing - seems a little cheap to me. Here I come THERMOS!"
5,Great product and my water was still cool after 1 hour in FL.,"Great bottle, fits perfectly into my bottle holder. Although I was a little skeptical with buying black (color of my bike), I still bought them without much expectations that my water would still be cold/cool. After approx 45 minutes and 1 hour into my ride, the water was still refreshing and cool."
4,great product,"I only gave this a 4 star rather than a 5 star rating because when you put ice in it, it sweats horribly. I wish that I would of purchased the insulated one instead."
3,Anyone else not like the bite tip?,"Maybe its just me, but I do not like that you have to bite HARD to get the water out. Maybe my teeth are sensitive? I had braces about 10 years ago and still wear my retainer on and off (yuck) because my teeth are still moving around, so when I bite down on this I feel pressure on my teeth like they're moving.I did not expect it to be so thick and hard to bite on to. And of course, If you don't bite hard enough you either get no water or you get water with air/bubbles. I think I'll keep it in my stash of bottles but I'm still looking for another."
3,great but,"I love this because it fits in my car cup holder and does not affect the taste. Cons: I use it in my office, and if I have filled it to the rim, it always leaks all over my clothes using the straw. (ok, i can stop filling it up). Con #2, is one day I looked inside the straw and both it and the tubing were filled with black mold. Sometimes the mold even gets in the top of the bottle. I guess you have to use the cleaning tablets and brush with this set up."
1,Leaking Lid,"I, like many others, was initially very impressed by these water bottles. I liked the straw, sizes of bottles, and the lid. However, after about 6 months of use, water started leaking from below the lighter gray plastic piece on top of the lid (where the plastic and rubber meet). The rest of the water bottle works fine, but for all the leaking, the price isn't worth it. I wouldn't recommend these any more."
2,"""It was an"" Amazing Water Bottle!","I purchased 2 Camelbak Better Water Bottle's for my wife and I and we love them. Originally the use was going to be for hiking, but I carry mine around with me everywhere! I was at first skeptical about the bite top, but it works great! Not a drop of water lost!-7/26-11 update-Changed my original glowing review from 5 stars to 2 stars.after about 2 weeks of taking this water-bottle everywhere, the hinges broke for the bite valve. I expected a bottle made by camelbak to be more rugged than this, but alas, it broke after 2 weeks of everyday use. I have emailed their warranty department twice and have heard nothing back from them. It still holds water, and the valve still works, (which is good and the reason for the 2 stars) but it no longer clamps down as it should. Will use this till I find a replacement."
2,Love the idea... but leaks too much :/,"I love the idea of this bottle! After losing a laptop due to spilling water all over the keyboard, I thought I was saved with this Camelbak because there is no ""open"" or ""closed""... so my computer would be safe from accidents.Unfortunately, this bottle is NOT leak proof, especially if you don't keep it upright. My purse, thankfully, is water-proof, but there's always a little puddle at the bottom when I put my camelbak in it. I've ruined quite a few notebook,s books, etc due to the spillage...I just wish that camelbak had created a straw feature that closed more securely. It's hard nowadays to find a 0.5L bottle that doesnt leak, especially one that doesn't need to be opened/closed (great for working out), but the spillage is quite a turn-off.Also, beware of taking this on the plane! The change in pressure will make water gush out of the straw once you bite into it.All in all, think about investing in another brand."
2,"Good, for a short amount of time.","I love these bottles. This was my second purchase because I fell on top of the first bottle and it started leaking, I assumed that it was my fault. WELL after having this new bottle for a little over a week a plastic part on the mouth piece broke and would no longer fold up all the way anymore. I don't even know how, it wasn't rough handled at all.:( Really is a shame considering I love the bottles dearly but I can't keep spending the money on bottles that don't last."
2,The bottle has a mind of it own,"This bottle was great at first, but now....every so often the bottle tends to have a mind of its own. It's starts spewing water out for no apparent reason...almost as if it had some backed-up pressure.This is also happens when I take sip. It just starts coming out.Not sure what's going on with that. I can't leave it anywhere because I fear it will spew on unwanted surfaces or myself.On top of that...the valve gets gunk build-up all the time. Not usre if its the water causing the dirtiness, but it's still very hard to clean it."
5,Impressing.,"Excellent sports bottle. I use it just for gym workouts and at first thought it may be too large. I was wrong! It fits beautifully in my car cup holder as well as the machine cup holders at the gym. The ounces are perfect, so I end up drinking everything by the end of my workout. Spillproof and easy to drink from. PBA free is a plus!"
5,Wonderful,"I love this water bottle! The bite valve is very fun and can be removed if you're not fond of it. The straw reaches down to the bottom. It is sturdy and easy to clean. It may drip if water is left in the valve, but other than that, it's pretty awesome!"
2,blah,"bite valves get loose and easily damage with children, this makes then leak which can cause a really big mess if you're dont pay attention to how you set it down. the plastic flip piece breaks easily if you forget to close it. safety torx makes it a tough fix. the 1 liter version has a base that is too thick for many holders but defnitely not as thick as some of the nalgene's. sturdy and shatter resistant but scratches are easily visible under sunlight. the convenient straw is an inconvenient clean.For a bottle on the go, I'd suggest a generic flip top. Much more convenient to clean and easy to open with your teeth.I currently use my bottle with the classic lid just to put in the office"
5,Best water bottle ever!,"I have several of these ""better bottles"" and they are all wonderful! Not only are they virtually leakproof, but I drink so much more water than with any other cup/bottle. The bite valve may take some getting used to, but once you do, you'll find that you are taking much larger sips, and because there is no cap to unscrew or top to worry about putting back on, you'll reach for it more often. It's great for the gym and carrying along with me during work. I've also found it's great to keep next to the bed because it's easy to drink from a horizontal position without spills!I've tried all three sizes of water bottles (0.5L, 0.75L and 1L) and the 0.75 is my favorite. It's a good size but still fits in my car's cupholders (which are slightly larger than average). The liter size is a little unwieldy and the 0.5 is just a stranger shape.The color on this bottle (sky blue) is much more of a pure turquoise than a sea green as it appears in the picture. Great color, though!"
1,Boring!,"I read The Other Boleyn Girl by Phillipa Gregory and loved it, so I chose this as a follow up and was very disappointed. It lacked any interest or excitement."
3,ok,"this was an ok book. Pretty much the same as the other books of princess Elizabeth's young life leading up to beecoming queen. It was interesting and easy to follow. It was a short book as well. The book begins with the death of king Henry VIII, and his young son Edward becomes the king. And it ends before princess Elizabeth becomes queen."
3,the only van/hagar album with balls,This is the only post David Lee Roth album by VH that I can listen to without cringing.The music is again rockin' & at times jazzy instead of sounding like 80's bubblegum.Hagar's voice is more powerful and has more feeling on this one than the previous two van hagar releases.Don't bother with any other V H albums released after 1984.
5,A Grandslam!,"Words can not describe the power of this album. From the drill sound in the beginning of pouncake and the hard driving force behind judgement day, to the heavy drum beat of pleasure dome and slick guitar work of dream is over, this cd has it all for metal fans. Sammy's voice has to be one of the greatest rock vices of our time. Roth could not even imagine hitting the notes that Hagar did in any of this era VH albums. Carnal Knowledge blisters your ears the way a good metal/hard rock cd should. Highly recommend"
2,Acidly Bad,"The album's opener is a glowing sign on how bad it could have been from the start for this item. It has 4 good songs but it don't cover enough on how bad this album is, it's their worst album in my opinion."
5,Their best,"Their music was never great, never anything special, just very popular and fan favorite. Then this came along out of nowehre. Poundcake is the hardest rocking song they ever recorded. Right Now is very social commentary oriented. Top Of The World and Run Around are just fun. Pleasure Dome is great, 316 is probably the best guitar instrumental since Classic Gas. The Dream Is Over is beautiful like poetry, Sammy's vocals shine on that track. It's their best, highlighted by probably their best song Right Now."
1,"Ha ha, you bought this album","Im so sorry you bought this album. If you want, I can come over to your house and slap you if you want. Just drop me a line."
3,"VanHagar sounds tired, the dream IS over",Runaround is the riff at the end of Jump made into a song. An example that the Van Halen brothers and Hagar are all getting tired and losing inspiration. Ed and Al's boozing is starting to take its toll here judging by this weak effort of songwriting.
5,One of the best,This album has been one of my favorites for decades! Van Halen is without a doubt one of the best bands of all time.
4,After 5150 and OU812 it was all downhill ...,"This one's not bad and it's not great. In my opinion, ""For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge"" (no, I will not use the acronym)is too heavy, too burdened. Where's the slap-happy fun of the previous cds? Maybe the boys were getting sick of each other even at this point. Something sure as hell was wrong. Anyway, this cd is not a toss-out like the arrogantly titled ""Van Halen III"". Poundcake, This Dream is Over (a Freudian slip?), Right Now and Top of the World are all great songs. And that's the great thing about cds: you can skip over all that draggy mess and go right to the good stuff."
3,Van Halen's WORST ALBUM?,"No. It's impossible a VH album be worse than VH III ! But this one is different. ""Judgement Day"", ""RIght Now"" and others are amazingly good, but there are two or three uninspíred fillers."
4,Some Great Songs With A Few Throwaways,"This album is very good with songs like ""Poundcake"",""Runaround"",""Right Now"" and ""Top Of The World"". But a few songs dropped this album to only 4 stars. ""Spanked"" and ""Man On A Mission"" are lyriclly throwaway ""weird"" songs that didn't need to be on an album this good. This album has a slightly harded rock sound than 5150 and OU812. I still recommend this album for all the good songs present here."
2,Worst of the Hagar-era VH albums,"This is by far the worst of the discs with Hagar as singer. With the exception of RIght Now and Top of the World, the rest of the disc is just plain boring."
1,Boring album,"Way back when, Van Halen rocked and had attitude. Now their brand of rock is stale and tasteless. Conclusion: an album by a band past it's prime; only for die hard fans and Van halen completists."
2,More of the same,"For Unlawful....is more of the same from the Van Halen/Sammy Hagr duo. Eddie trying to write the perfect radio friendly song with Sammy Hagar adding another collection of goofy machissimo lyrics. The effort opens up with ""Poundcake"", a basically riffless song with Hagar supplying an ample amount of junior-high lockeroom lingo lyrics. The albums high point commercially was ""Right Now"" complete with a very un-Van Halen-like contemporary smooth jazz piano offered up by Ed much to the delight of soft-rockers everywhere. The video makes the song seem much better than it really is, and that in itself is very un-Van Halen-like. Overall the songs rank as poor as any in the post Lee Roth era where melancholy rules the day. Commercially a high point for the band as they make new fans in the early 1990s, but artistically a low point as per usual with anything Sammy Hagar touches. Skip it."
1,The ruination of Van Halen,Sammy Hagar is the death of Van Halen....how could you replace a man like David Lee Roth with Sammy Hagar....I don't get it....if you do..tell me
1,Total Abortion!,"This is not just one of the worst Van Halen Albums, this is one of the worst Albums ever. The new lead vocals are awful. The songs are slapped together. This album will even make you long for the VanHagar erra.It is a sad sad day for Van Halen fans."
4,you've all got it wrong,"The real star of this album is Andy Johns, who produced most of the instrumental tracks. He's the one responsible for making Alex's usually limp-sounding drums sound like John Bonham here, lending a hair-raising ferocity to the sound as a whole. Ted Templeman came in late in the recording process, and it shows; there aren't a lot of vocal harmonies as there are in other albums. Nevertheless, I think this is the last good album they made, if not the heaviest. And stop it with the Dave vs. Sammy thing already; they're through with their 3rd vocalist now, for god's sake."
4,"psss,yo man wake up","the first sammy vh album that sounds like the classic dlr days. killer mind blowing tracks like""Right Now,Runaround,and Top of the world"". Other fillers are exceptable, but could of used a little extra work and effort. It was said to be maybe the best van halen album out there when i was listening to rockline one night. i ran out and bought it. it's overrated but still worth about 15 of your hard earned buckarroos. sorry for that weird word i just typed."
2,Change of direction,The first VH album I ever bought was 5150 followed by 0U812. I then went backwards enjoying the DLR albums as well. This album is -not- what I wanted to hear next. It has taken me -years- to come back to it and I still don't like what I hear. There are a few good songs to be found on this album...but my least favorite VH album for sure.
3,"Potential controversy,if you know what I mean","Potential controversy,if you know what I mean. This is the band's ninth album and the third during the Sammy Hagar era. This album sold less than its predecessors. RIGHT NOW became a hit and was later used in some kind of television commercial. This album failed to generate more than a couple of big hits like its predecessors. TOP OF THE WORLD was the other Top 10 hit from the album."
2,"Not Van Halen, Van Hagar","Wrong. It's like expecting cold Pizza in the fridge and finding old vegetables instead. If you like Van Halen skip this one, if you like Van Hagar buy it. For some reason most bands seem better when the members hate each other. I don't know why, I do know that Van Hagar was cashing a check that was drawn on previous achievements and Eddie V's guitar skills, he's still great, Sammy couldn't drive a golf ball 55 yards if he had a V2 rocket."
2,"Yes, people. This album really does suck.","Sammy Hagar can sing okay, but he can't write lyrics if they crawled up his leg and bit him in the arse. Anyway, Dave was what the band was all about - crazy guitar and crazy lyrics. Eddie's guitar playing only got better over the years, but seriously, guys, lose the Cherones and Hagars, and get back to where the music belongs."
2,review,"this book has every diagnosis, but very cumbersome and not convenient to travel with. Rather use the internet or a nutrition related book"
4,Looks good...,"It's really big and thick and looks like what I will need. I got it for taking medical terminology class. I just received it so can't tell you much more than that, but definitely better than I expected for the price that I got it for :)"
3,Short lived fun,"Purchased this to use with the Bruder garbage truck. The garbage truck is still going strong, but the sound and light module has stopped working without much use."
2,No Way To Mount It To Trucks,"There is no way to mount it to trucks. Also, it is defficult for young children (under 5) to change the reflectors, so I do not recommend it for them."
2,Good for light and sound - Bad for production manufacturer location,"This product is ""made in China"" and not ""made in Germany"" as stated. At about $8, this thing is expensive. This light and sound module should come with every Bruder vehicle.Back to the unit iteself, it looks and feels cheap. The plastic is different from the Bruder vehicle plastic. The sound is loud enough and clear. You press one of four red dots to turn on and you press it again to turn off. I would still buy it to complement my son's expensive Bruder vehicles and to enhance the playbility."
5,"Frightening, gripping and fantastic!",Nancy was hoping to have a relaxing vacation with her friends but she was very wrong. Soon she is tied up in a mystery with one of her her best friends falling for the main suspect. Nancy puts her skills to the test to solve a fantastic mystery.
1,"This album is not ""live""","Just a friendly consumer announcement: This album consists of readily available studio tracks with live crowd applause dubbed over them, along with a few previously released live tracks available on ""Ray Charles in Person"" and ""The Gold Collection"" from Retro (the latter now available in improved form on the recent budget release ""Genius of Soul Live"" from Fine Tune). The sound is also sub-par. ..."
5,Awesome!,"I have had this flashdrive for a couple of years now & it has worked flawlessly! It has even survived going thru the wash & all my data was still intact!! Love the fact that it's retractable, so there's no cap to lose."
5,SHE IS GOING TO MAKE IT.,I THINK THAT WAS A GREAT SONG AND IT FIT ME PERFECTLY. SHE TALKS ABOUT LOVE AND I THINK THAT IS SO SWEET BECAUSE SHE COULD HELP SOME PEOPLE OUT BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HAVE BROKE UP BUT WHEN THEY LISTEN TO THAT SONG THEY MIGHT REALIZE THEY BELONG TOGETHER. SO I THINK THAT'S GREAT AND YOU KEPP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
5,"""Never gonna let you go"" shows the the soul of my love.","The first time I heard ""Nerver gonna let you go"" was on ""Ladies night out"" and from the first moment I heard it I knew that there was something special about it. It seems to show the soul of a person love for another. If you never knew how to tell someone how you feel this songs does that for you. Faith Evans have out done herself here. she has given new meaning to love. I hope she continues to produces songs that will touch people the way this song has. I too am a singer/songwriter and I only hope that I will be able to write lyric that touch people soul."
3,Good but very stiff...,"The parka is sound and does the job as advertised. My only problem with it is how stiff it is. Moving in it sounds like crinkling plastic. No silent approaches wearing this parks, but you will be dry."
5,An honest account of life's anguish and joy,"One might think it takes courage and bravery to open up and reveal the most intimate truthes about oneself. Or perhaps in this case, it takes a profound understanding of who oneself really is. Mr. Keenan has written a most poignant and non-dogmatic description of what a life consists of. Combining prose and poetry, his book is not a self-help manual, or yet another zen biography, but rather an honest recounting or accounting of scenes along the way. It is refreshing, beautiful, and sincere, and I am full of gratitude for having read it."
3,A Dharmic autobiography with poetry,"This memoir by a dharma student and priest is mostly beautifully written, with courageous honesty and with clear reference to his dharma practice - such that the teachings of Zen are easily accessible for a reader unversed in Buddhist or Zen teachings. This much is an achievement. However, the throughline of St. Nadie feels underdeveloped, and much of the poetry did not move me. For readers who have read other books on Zen, the ""Zen memoir"" aspect will be very familiar without any new angle on the teaching or its realization in everyday life."
1,Fatuous and cheap,"This book makes my blood boil. Many students and parents will waste hard-earned money on what is little more than a joke book, expecting a text that may give an edge in examinations. This is a dangerously ill-considered book. I urge you not to buy it."
1,diatribe,"I was also linked to this page by a so called puzzle, i actually did the puzzle on three seperate occasions, giving three completely different answers, Geuss what? on each occasion i was informed i had the correct answer, then linked to a site to win an ipod. I geuss it is a numbers game, but surely we could contact trading standards and complain about mis representation, fraud, deception etc etc. I feel sorry for the people who fall for these scams. Because that is all they are."
2,Not what I wanted afterall,"Not the book of fun tricks I was told it was, I told a friend about this great book full of tips and tricks and fun number games I had seen in a classroom. I was told this was it (right down to the author),it was not.it has some tricks, but nothing to make a kid want to learn more.Oh well, someday I will find what I was looking for"
3,pretty good,"Not my favorite bread mix as it has a little bit of a ""gluten free"" taste to it, but better than most. Also, very easy to make as you can prepare it on the one-hour gluten free setting of a bread maker. It's a pretty good option."
3,"I was disappointed, expecting better taste/lighter","I had a hard time getting it done, even after ""over baking"" it was still sticky inside when I sliced it.Has strong taste, one of the flours I guess, much prefer Gluten Free Pantry Sandwich bread."
4,Tasty but had to modify,"Since I've found the gluten-free breads in the market to be pricey, brick hard and barely palatable, I thought I'd give Namaste a try. After all, it got rave reviews.The directions say to follow your manufacturer's recipe if you have a bread machine, so that's what I did......with a bit of modification as I just couldn't see wasting 3 perfectly good egg yolks (the recipe provided calls for 1 egg and 3 whites). So I used all of the 4 eggs, but the mixture looked way too runny. So I added 2/3 cup tapioca flour and 1/2 cup rice flour and VOILA! The loaf turned out PERFECT - light, fluffy, very tasty. None of the qualities of the flavorless bricks I'd been buying in the market. Had Namaste included the flour I had to add myself, I would have given it a 5-star review."
1,A mistake and a real disappointment!,"I ordered this item by mistake. I thought I was ordering the Pizza Crust which our family just loves. When I saw that I have made the mistake, I decided to give it a try - we now had 6 packages. But this was the worst GF bread we have ever made. Had to keep putting it back in the oven because the middle was raw and outside was hard as a rock. We tried to eat it, but just threw it out - the first time I have ever hated a GF item so much!"
4,Great Gluten-Free Bread by Namaste,"After trying several recipes for gluten-free bread, I find many tastelike cardboard. Namaste makes a great mix which I found is made even betterby adding fennel and rye seeds to it. Very tasty. I highly recommend all theNamaste products. I have tried and love the pizza mix, the waffle mix which I make blueberry pancakes out of,and the chocolate cake mix which I make cupcakes out of. That way I canfreeze some for later. All mixes are free of: gluten, wheat, potato, soy,dairy and casein, but not free of taste!"
5,Best gluten free bread out there!,Wow as always Namaste has delivered again.This bread taste so good that my gluten eating hubby thought it was great.It stays fresh longer then store bought brands.The directions call for baking it in the oven but i bake it in my bread machine and it comes out sooo warm and yummy.
1,Low Budget,I was quite disappointed with this dvd. The girls' styles were not up to date.. the stuff they wear and their hairstyles are quite old fashioned.. then i looked at the production date and it was from 2005..but still.. and there weren't any WOW techniques.. i didn't learn anything.. NOTHING at all..
1,dont waste your money!,This is one of the worst dvds Ive ever purchased. I should have spent my 20 on a lapdance at a club I would have learned more. The music is cheesy and low budget and the video is trashy not sexy.
1,So funny!,"Don't waste your money on this. I bought it to learn a dance but it was more something to laugh at. The video quality is cheap, the dances are corny and unimpressive. Learned so much more from Carmen Electras strip aerobics."
2,boring,I enjoyed the music but the move shwn were boring and predictable. i guess it is a great tool for a novice.
1,Strip to It DVD,"I was looking for a more professional workout video. I was very disappointed with this DVD because it looks homemade and is extremely dull. It comes with a music CD to dance to, but the quality of the music is not all that great either. Buyer Beware! Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Basic striptease moves from rate R movie scene,"As noted by other reviewers, the quality of the DVD is lacking. Having read the reviews prior to purchasing the DVD, I expected that and was not disappointed. I do not consider myself to be a good dancer but I can find the beat and shimmy a bit. With that, I was very disappointed in the dance material itself. The instructors gave no more education then what I could have learned watching the basic striptease scene off of my favorite rated R movie."
1,Boring,"If you are looking to learn ANYTHING about lapdancing or floor work.... this is NOT the dvd for you. First off... I want to say that this dvd did not play in my dvd player and it is a new dvd-rw player. I could only watch it on my computer. The sound was turned up as loud as it would go and I could barely hear what they were saying, even after I put on my headphones! It features 4 women who do alot of talking and very little showing. It teaches you how to take your shoes off... COME ON! Do we really need help with that? I have seen better dancing at a high school prom. The demo dancing is completely useless and boring and the women have no skills. I am really disappointed in this dvd... Especially since it is $28! What a waste of good money."
3,Inspiration for those of us who are shy,"Some good basic ideas to dancing for your man, but if you have no inhibitions, this video is not for you. The moves were simple, alot of the tips were common sense. The cd was not good at all in my opinion, due to the lyrics. Who wants to strip for their man while a man is rapping about seeing naked girls at a strip club? Yes, the name of the song is ""Naked Girls"". Hokey at best as far the lyrics, the music would be better without them. The girls who give tips and sample dances were real, down to earth. Unfortunately, some of the tips from each one overlapped each other. I was desperately trying to suprise my husband for valentines and needed some ideas. I would buy used, don't pay more than $15-20."
5,Best keyboard available,"Not that I've tried every keyboard available but of the many I've used this is the best. I actually purchased this for my wife to use with her laptop and she absolutely loves it. It's well made with a nice feel to the keys, the programmable keys are well placed and functional and it's a nice large size. For the price I don't think you'll find anything nicer."
2,no good for gaming.,i bought this keyboard because it was cheap and it was by microsoft. i was planning to use it for gaming but the problem is that the f5 and f6 keys dont work when playing games. and the zoom in and zoom out thing feels so cheap.it is very comfortable.
1,Never worked,"I ordered ""Microsoft Digital Media Pro Keyboard"" from ""V.I.P. Group Corporation"". Order processing was no problems.But when I tried to use it I found that at least 3 keys don not work : ""c"", ""3"" and ""Web launch"".Idea is good : cheap keyboard with a lot of nice functions, implementation of this idea - terrible."
3,microsoft digital media pro keyboard,"Microsoft Digital Media Pro KeyboardNice keyboard, but if you hit a key below the shift key, it will bring up and window at the left top and you have ot click againg to type. I also noticed that sometimes my email would completely disappear and I would have to retype it."
5,"Like my old one, only much better!","I got a new computer that came with a very basic keyboard and no wrist rest. I loved my old Microsoft Multimedia keyboard but couldn't make it work on a USB port, even with an adapter, so I had to find something else. I tried to upgrade to the Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 model, but couldn't use it and had to return it. I then took the leap and got this one and it's even better than my old one. I really like the touch and feel of the keys and I like the various special functions, some of which I had before and others that are new for me. I highly recommend this keyboard for anyone who likes the usual straight-line layout. I rely heavily on the attached wrist rest to keep my hands and wrists in the right position and find it really makes for comfortable typing without injury or pain."
5,Good keyboard,"Hey good keyboard, all keys are full size. theres nothing worse than a keyboard that has been condensedthanks"
4,"Research your toys, first.","I bought this keyboard for my brother-in-law due to what Ifeel is the best deal for his money, both in whomever sellsit, and compared with the more expensive similar itemsin the same category, in other words, always getting your bestmoney's worth. He's very happy with my selection, the product andwe both feel that he got his money's worthBy the way, will somebody wish me a happy birthday, 79yrs as oftoday, 16Nov07."
5,A Great Keyboard,I boght one of these to repalce my old keyboard which bit the dust. I found no problems installing it and it works so well that i bought two more for my kids to use on their computers. I like the customability and all the bells and whistles that you don't need but like to have with a keyboard.
5,Even better than the Commodore 64!,"I hope someone reading this review is old enough to know what that means.Simply put, this keyboard is EXCELLENT for touch typists (I am) who pound the daylights out of their keys (I do.) It is solid, well put together, and VERY comfortable. I'm someone who types 8-10 hours a day, and I need a keyboard that can keep up with me.This one does that, to be sure. Works pretty well with my Mac, too. I wil say that if you want to use it with multiple computers, make sure to get a USB-based KVM switch, as it will NOT work with a KVM switch when used with the PS2 adapter."
4,"Solid, useful shortcut keys, not as quiet as I had hoped","I can't ding this product for not meeting my expectations. I should have tried it out in person. The keyboard feels very solid, the media shortcuts are useful, the installation software was painless to install.I really wanted a quiet keyboard so I could type (take notes) while using my headset on conference calls, etc. Despite the MS ""quiet touch"" keys and at least one review to the contrary, the keyboard is about as loud as the ancient standard Dell keyboard that I was using before. It is definitely quieter than some, but I had hoped for better. Is it really that hard to make a quiet keyboard? Next time I will shop in person.Still, I give it four stars. Unless you're looking specifically for a silent experience, you'll be satisfied with this good quality keyboard."
5,Love it!,"I love my new keyboard! It is comfortable, the access keys work very well and it is a very nice looking keyboard as well.Would definitely buy it again!"
5,"love it , still using it","I got the keyboard a while back. Works well. Using it and it is not a quiet one, but very durable. It fell many times, I took it apart to clean, everything and anything. Basically if you want something long lasting, get this keyboard."
2,Caveat emptor--all USB keyboards!,"Unlike PS2 keyboards, those connected to USB ports do not become available for use until those ports are activated. So what? So it is impossible to access a computer's setup screens or to start Windows in anything but regular mode. Is that important? Every time a computer has a serious problem, yes. If you buy a USB keyboard, keep a PS2 model handy as well."
1,just a regular keyboard... extra buttons don't do anything,"This is a good keyboard for the money... if you spend about $12 for it. All of the extra button do nothing. The slider, the favorites bar at the top... the ""My Documents"" buttons do not work. If you think that I need a software or driver upgrade, you are wrong. I went to Microsoft... there is a lot of searching, but not a lot of finding. if you find a keyboard with out the bells and whistles, buy it instead. This one is just a keyboard."
4,new keyboard,"not bad, does exactly what it says it does. features only seem to work for microsoft. Mac. Solaris, or linux works only as keyboard, extra features do nothing"
5,A great ergonomic and functional keyboard,"Finally Microsoft has done something that pleases. This keyboard is great, the keys are nicely placed and nice to the touch. The extra function keys really make working the computer happen faster. The software that comes with it both for Mac OSX and Windows allows you to assign differen functions to the extra buttons on the keyboard even if you don't like the default reccommendations. I use it with my G5 running Tiger and control my iTunes from the keyoard keys, zoom into PDF documents with the keyboard slider, launch email, browser, calculator, applications and favorite folders, control volume, switch users and so on. An excellent keyboard and well worth the price. Highly reccommended A++++"
4,This keyboard is NOT Vista certified.,"This is a great keyboard, but it has the 5.1 ver. driver, and Vista download driver from Microsoft is ver. 6.1. So, if u need to boot up your pc w/ this keyboard, u might be needing another keyboard, just to get up off the ground. U can get it to work on Vista, but don't think it's all roses for Vista, cuz it's NOT. Like i say, it's a great keyboard, but NOT Vista certified. I won't recommend it, but it is a great little keyboard."
2,Microsoft Keyboard,"The keyboard has nice features, but is heavy on the fingers. If you spend a lot of time on the computer typing, pick a different one, as you fingers can and will get tired."
3,good general purpose,"this is a good keyboard if you using it for typing and the shortcuts work once you get the drivers from Microsoft for vista. but if you play games, then this keyboard is a problem because you can't press more than 2 keys at a time, if u try 2 press 3 keys, then it does not respond. i find this really annoying when i'm playin Call of Duty 4, where these 3 key situation happen often. hence the 3 starts, minus two stars for the maximum number of keys you can press at one time, which is importing in 2009 pc gaming/computing"
5,Very good keyboard,This keyboard feels very nice to type on and has all the shortcut keys you could need. It is very comfortable and I have really enjoyed using this. I highly recommend it.
5,excellent keyboard,an excellent keyboard. very good for the price. all the extra keys are very helpful
5,The best keyboard in a long time,"I just bought this keyboard after reading all the positive reviews here. This is the highest-rated PC keyboard on Amazon and rightly so. I'm typing on it right now and love the feel and feeback. It's also well made, although I don't care much for the extra keys (and don't quite like the way Microsoft puts the primary F markings in front, not on top, of the keys). Not since the days of IBM keyboards have I been so happy with a keyboard. If you are in the market for this peripheral, this is the one to get, unless you want cordless.BTW the keyboard is USB-native but comes with a PS/2 adapter for those whose PCs have a PS/2 port."
2,This is a cheap keyboard and its made that way,I bought this keyboard hoping it was a step up from the $5 one that I had before. Imagine my surprise when it was worse! As soon as I took it out of the box the wrist guard snapped off! The keys got stuck so much it was almost impossible to use without having to lift the key back up in order to use it...don't bother with this one.
4,Comfortable keyboard,"I like the built-in handrest. It is smooth in operation. All the buttons do make it a bit harder to clean, but that is a minor complaint. Way better than the awful keyboard that came with my Dell computer and this one is not expensive."
4,Product priced to sell,"I decided on this keyboard as it was not priced as high as the others. The keyboard has the extra features I wanted above the F keys such as my documents, my pictures, my music, mail, web home and even messenger. It also has extra keys for the media player such as play, fast forward and rewind, and also has volume control and mute. It even has extra keys in which one can save their favorite sites. A side slider for those who want to do a close up for pictures. (It actually works) The letter keys are kind of flimsy, (narrower than the older board letter keys) so it may feel uncomfortable for those with stubby fingers or wide hands. One has a choice to use a USB connection to connect to the computer.(Exactly what I was looking for) The USB connection comes with an adapter just in case one has a need to use the older type connection so it works both ways. For the price, the keyboard is well worth it."
4,Great value; solid keyboard,"I consider this to be a nice, middle-class wired USB keyboard. The media/shortcut/quick launch keys are convenient and easy to configure and rebind. Keys feel firm and are quiet. My only minor complaint is that the zoom slider does not work quite as well as advertised; from what I've tested, only Microsoft Word works with it consistantly."
5,One of the best wired keyboards available,"This is a very solid keyboard, as only microsoft knows, they have build the best keyboards for a long time. Its quiet, the keys have the right presure and feedback, its very well design, and it has very good support, with new drivers I havent had a single problem. For mouses i still prefer Logitech, but for keyboards microsoft still the king. Defently recommended."
2,Incredible Disappearing Keys,"I would have rated this keyboard much higher because I love all the shortcuts, but I have NEVER seen letters wear off so fast (like 3 months)! I have short, natural nails, and am not using any cleaners other than compressed air. I use several different keyboards on a regular basis, yet this is the only one whose ""home row"" has completely disappeared. (I tried replacement stickers; don't bother.) I purchased it in 2008, so it could be that newer ones do not have this problem, but though I am in the market for a new keyboard at this point, I will not be buying this model again."
5,Impressive!,"My hat is off to Pinecone. The first keyboard I received did not function properly. Alex contacted me and offered to test out another to ensure it worked, and he shipped it out immediately along with a pre-paid return label for the defective keyboard. I just received the keyboard and it is magnificent!! Thank you Alex! After reading the raving reviews about this media keyboard, I was distraught when the original keyboard did not perform. Pinecone has made everything right, and for that they get 5+ stars! Thanks again Alex. If you have media center, don't hesitate to make this purchase. The keys are fluid and soft to the touch. Pictures, music, documents with the touch of just one button. The zoom feature is nice for that small legal print. Messanger is a one touch feature also. You will not be disappointed making this purchase, and you'll be purchasing from a company who backs what they sell. A very happy customer!"
5,"The ""bible"" of Straits diving","I wouldn't think of diving in the Straits of Mackinac without taking this book along. It makes a great read by the fireplace too, but it's an even better reference guide to keep on the dive boat. Chuck & Geri Feltner are the recognized experts on the shipwrecks of the Straits area and this book is a must for any serious Great Lakes wreck diver."
2,Truly Disappointed,"As a fan of his previous books, ""Barcelona Plates"" and ""Overtaken,"" I was looking forward to this book of Sayle's short stories published in 2001. The first several stories gave hints of his previous ability to craft quirky sharp-edged characters and satisfying plot twists. Sadly, the overall quality of these stories were poor. The writing was self-consciously intellectual and insularly English. I was unable to continue to finish the last story, a 100 page plodding effort that refused to show any signs of life. Would recommend Barcelona Plates highly and leave this tome in the remainder bin."
5,Excellent pocket resource,"Family of four used this frequently in July 1999, 20 day trip to Norway. Only once did it not contain the word we were searching for. Even if word desired is not listed, most likely a coorelated word will be that enables one to figure out what the unlisted word means."
2,For travellers not for readers,"This book was designed principally for Norwegians learning English, not the other way around. It makes a fine travel dictionary to carry with you in Norway. But if you are hoping to read a Norwegian text, don't count on this book."
3,Never could find the right word,"I took this dictionary on a trip to Norway. It seemed as if every word that we tried to look up was not in the dictionary. From ingredients to road signs we were clueless. We had a lovely trip, but the dictionary was not a help; it's just doesn't have enough words."
5,Great Necklace,Great item. My wife had one that we bought for around $50 at the mall and it had her breaking out in a rash.This item is nickel free. She has been wearing it since before Christmas and loves it.
4,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With----100% Space Owl-Free Book!,"A graphic novel, based on the online comic strip ""Scary-Go-Round"", this is both well-written, & charmingly drawn.It also has a do-it-yourself Android Girlfriend. With Hypno-Eyeballs.NOTE--THIS IS ALL NEW MATERIAL, never seen in the online comic strip!Buy this. Laugh. Leave happily afterward.ALERT--SCARY-GO-ROUND IS ENDING! Cartoonist is starting a new strip! THIS BOOK WON'T LAST LONG! BUY IT ASAP! There probably won't be a ""later"".The Hipster gives it a Big Thumbs UP!"
3,Solid study skills outline,"This book provides an informative base for sound study skills. The methods presented are very basic and fundamental to the subject of effective study. The concepts will not seem new to most readers but their integration into a logical structure for studying may well be. There exists a few typographical errors in the text and the exercises included could be improved somewhat. Overall a good (but not great) book. Also, it should be noted that this book is geared towards those just entering college."
4,Useful Companion for Study,"A very well structured and easy to read little book. While there is certainly no ground breaking material here, it does a solid job of intergrating the basic principles of objectivism into study, such as objectivity, rationality, and purpose. I found the sections on active reading, motivational monitoring, and exam-taking especially useful. Since the exercises at the end of the chapters are time-consuming, I only skim read them, but I was still able to get a lot out of this book. Although there are countless study guides out there which all offer basically the same tips and techniques, this one is a gem. I recommend it to any student looking to fufill their potential."
5,Orchid's Bloom,This is an elegantly written story of a polio survivor and a delicious slice of life in the mid west from 1940 to the present.
2,Inspiring...,"There was an error in rating, it was originally given 5 stars, but did not show as such! -lori cordiniMs. O'Brien's book is an excellent read. It was written in a simple personal way that gave me the feeling of sitting across from her at her kitchen table. It held my interest completely. Her candid approach to her illness and how she overcame the obstacles of her life circumstances with dignity and courage is applauded. I couldn't put it down! I was especially touched at the very end of the story, where the title came from. I couldn't hold back the tears! -lori cordini, Boone. NC"
1,"Don't buy this, wasteeeee money.","When it came in, i and my daughter very disappointed this. we wait and wait ........ but it was so roughly made in.....I recommend everyone there are a lot of choice to buy other product. Remenber If you buy this you waste money.Don't buy......Don't waste money."
1,Broke inside an adapter = Made it useless !!!!!,"Bought november 2011.Today the 1/4"" jack detached inside another adapter making THEM BOTH USELESS !!!!!!!BEWARE .... Don't buy this device.ByeFortunately it became unavailable at Amazon."
5,Chopin Edition:Complete Works (17 CD /box Set),"Love it, most economical pack for such a great collections, good quality. All performed by great musicians and orchestras. Must buy. Highly recommend it."
3,"a good value, but very few well known pianists","One is led to believe that pianists of renown are used in this 17 CD offering; however, those who are well known offer no more than a little over 1/17 of the music offered, sometimes no more than a 4 minute exposure. The sound is good, but a number of the of the performances are less the mediocre."
4,It is ok,"With Brilliant Classics often you get the LOT (I have most of the box sets) and as usual it is a mixed bag ranging from ok to good, seldom ""brilliant"". Overall, it is far from earthshattering. So, in my humble opinion, if you after Chopin box set treat yourself to Artur Rubinstein collection of 11 CD (it is a bargain, I almost did not buy it, because I was suspicions about it being so cheap) absolutely marvellous."
5,Intimate Chopin,"If you love tranquility and melodies, love and sentiments, you will strongly appreciate this 17 cd box set. I bought a lot of music from Amazon this year and in 2008. This is my best buy!I listened to the 17 cd and nearly all of them are poignant!"
5,Good balance - effective in tough clay,This tool seems to be the perfect tool for breaking up my tough clay-like ground in areas where I need to 'regrade' a bit for winter runoff control. It's easier for me to use than something like a digging bar to loosen otherwise impossible to loosen subsoil. I have several acres where it will continue to come in handy.
4,EXCELENT,"ITS AN EXCELLENT COMPILATION!!!! i'm french and it's difficult to find this cd but it's very very good with YUKMOUTH, KILLA TAY...my note: 17/20"
5,I really love this book!,"This book is a great book for kids because Lottie is a girl that doesn't want to wear her blue skirt and red sweater. So she decides to wear her princess dress that's glittery gold. The book was funny, that's why I really like it."
5,Very suspenseful movie.,"The movie has an ending that will leave you speechless. Lots of love making and passionate scenes. Not for kids under the age of 18 for sure. If you like drama and suspense from the 50's, this is your movie. In color and about 3 hours long so grab about 6 bags of popcorn and a 12 pack of soda.Enjoy"
2,the other side of midnight,"One of the best movies of yesteryears, in fact now u dont find them any where, Though I was keen to have this title, accidently I hit on Amazon and I am thankful to Amazon for sending the DVD well before time than anticipated. As regard the product that is one of its kind movie, a masterpiece."
4,The Other Side of Midnight,"I was surprised when I first saw the movie. It didn't seem to be a good movie when I first viewed it. The beginning I refer to.It's a very good movie even though it's lengthy. Alas, nevertheless entertaining throughout."
5,"Great ""Twisted"" Love Story - beautiful clothes and riches","I don't care what the critics said about this film now or when I first saw it in a movie theater - I think it is great. I has everything I really like in a movie: Great suspense story with a twist, beautiful clothes, beautiful scenery and ""riches"". I loved it !!"
4,Trashfest...Or I Lost My Virtue to Boss Hogg,"In the vast cinematic wasteland there is a place for movies like ""The Other Side of Midnight"". When done properly this kind of material produces campy classics like ""Showgirls"". When done wrong you get ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Basic Instinct 2"". The source material offered up by Sidney Sheldon's novel is raunchy and ribald...and delicious. I deny the film five stars because director Charles Jarrott nor his nominal stars, the mannequinlike Marie-France Pisier or John ""The Chin"" Beck(""Rollerball"" and ""The Big Bus"") seem to grasp the satiric implications of the material they were given. Pisier, though, has a pretty good scene with Christian Marquand(the lousy rubber plantation sequence in ""Apocalypse Now Redux"") that involves body oil and a bucket of ice. Only Susan Sarandon seems to get it and she grabs the gusto. Hard to believe there's something of an old-fashioned quality to the film and it's international locations look gorgeous. Trash fans, enjoy!"
2,Not as half as good as the book,"Too many important episodes are excluded, and therefore, some of the characters were not portrayed in the right way.The missing episodes should have explained why certain people behaved the way they did. For this reason, the story was difficult to follow, and the excitement vanished. Perhaps 160min was not enough to dramatize the story."
3,Kiss the Bride will make you want to pucker up,"An Italian family prepares for an upcoming wedding. The recipe for disaster: 3 fighting sisters, 2 family squabbles, 1 ex-boyfriend and a partridge in a pear tree. Add a splash of Italian culture to the subplot and stew. This movie is equal parts trite and entertaining, but the cast is surprisingly good with standout performances by Jonathan Schaech and Talia Shire. In a not-so-clever twist, one sister brings home her lesbian lover (Alyssa Milano) simply for the shock value. By the end of the film, the outsider shows everyone who's the boss. -Cynthia Gunnells, CeleGAYtions"
1,Kiss Mah Butt!,"No, I'm not a kid, but this movie was so bad that I actually wanted to throw it in our driveway and run it over about 60 times, or at least until it was nothing but granules of sand. Horrible story of a family full of shallow creeps played by shallow creeps. I'd rather watch a Police Academy film festival or Ernest Does Dallas than this...thing. Italians everywhere should be offended, but if you happen to have taste, you should be too, race, religion, or creed notwithstanding. It's an equal opportunity vomit fest."
5,The Start of Something BIG!,"This is how that ""Greek Wedding"" movie should have been done! Its sweet without being schmaltzie. Its gritty without losing heart. I like to think of this film as that ""other wedding film"" on ecstasy (in a very flattering way). It was written, produced, directed, and starred the very talented Vanessa Parise. Keep your eye on this young woman folks, she is going places!"
3,It was okay,It's worth watching for Johnny Whitworth and his interview in the bonus section. *swoon*
1,Bluegrass Muzak,"This CD falls short as a tribute to the music of Neil Young and as an example of bluegrass music. It lacks the fire of the artist and the genre. Bluegrass musicians with some passion and creativity should try the same song selection, that would be worth the cost of burning in the disk; this one isn't even a decent coaster. Send 15 bucks to CF foundation, it will be a much better celebration of the man and his incredible music."
2,OK I admit it,The only reason this CD got 2 stars from me is because it makes such a great coaster. I use it to keep the drinks from messing up my table. I have never been a Neil Young fan anyways. In fact I almost ripped my sterio out of the wall when I heard his version of Imagine on the Tribute album for the 9/11 victims. It is easy to say he is no John Lennon.
3,"Come On, It's not that Bad","OKSo some of you don't like Bluegrass Music,Some of you don't like the interpretations,yes needle and the damage done is a bit out of center but some of the playing on this album is very very good.So for what it is I like it.(my favorite Neil Young albums are On The Beach,Tonight's The Night,Zuma,Time Fades Away) but it still allows me to enjoy fine Playing.I am also a Led Zep Fan but it doesn't mean I have to hate Dolly Parton's version of Stairway to heaven (I Like It)!!!.If you don't like Bluegrass DO NOT BUY THIS but if you like Mr Young and Bluegrass you will probably like this or many parts of this album."
1,Watch out for same cd with different title,"This album is the same as the album titled ""Gettin' High On Neil Young"" and ""The Ultimate Pickin' On Neil Young"" though the last one has three extra tracks tacked onto the end:15. Rockin' The Free World16. Country Girl17. Harvest MoonIt isn't a bad compilation, but sort of Bluegrqss elevator music. Not worth paying for three times though!"
2,They definitely aren't the next Cannibal Corpse,"I was very disappointed with this album like all other Mortician releases. All you can hear from the singer are grunts. He really has no vocal ability at all. I do think that the horror movie samples in some of Mortician's songs are kinda interesting, but when they start playing ""music"", it sounds really lame"
5,Quicksilver Moon,"I loved the Ladies of Quicksilver Moon. They were so very real people. Isolde, the ""heroine"" of this novel, even though a vampire was eerily likable. The way Ms. Ardinger wove the different character stories was a rich tapestry of new and old themes. She portayed each person, be they the sadistic Rev. Mudge to his poor browbeaten followers, as someone you could say, ""I know someone just like this.""I laughed, cried and shuddered at how these women confronted each of the trials and joys of their lives as Witches in the modern world. The hatred they encountered, the love they shared, the very mundaneness of ""Life 101"" and the shadows of the past still out to persecute those that follow the Goddess.I will leave you with just this so as not to spoil the fun you will have discovering the quirkiness of the characters and the plot themes. All I will add is that this is one of the best new novels I have read in ages and will definitely re-read it again and again. Enjoy!"
2,FLAWED,ALTHOUGH THIS BOOK IS A DEFINITIVE STUDY OF GOOGIE COFFEE SHOP STYLE IT HAS A SERIOUS FLAW.THE NARRATIVE AND ILLUSTRATIONS ARE VERY GOOD BUT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO READ WITHOUT A MAGNIFIER. I AM AN AVERAGE SIGHTED READER WITH VISION CORRECTED TO 20/20 BUT I HAD DIFFICULTY IN READING THE TEXT AND STUDYING THE ILLUSTRATIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR SMALL SIZE.MOST OF THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE ABOUT 1/2 POSTCARD SIZE OR SMALLER. THE TEXT IS SMALLER AND LIGHTER THAN MOST BOOKS MAKING READING DIFFICULT AT BEST. IF I WERE MR.HESS I WOULD BE PLEASED WITH MY EFFORT BUT VERY UNHAPPY WITH MY PRINTER.
2,Fact Check,"The authors mentioned that archaea only exist in the harshest environments on earth. This is simply not true in the least bit. When reading a nonfiction I need the information to be correct and up to date (for the publishing year, at least). The book wasn't bad, though the writing was a bit labored, but I can't help but wonder what else was incorrect?"
4,Not really a popular-level book...,"The topic and the contents of this book are very interesting, but it is rather heavy reading. If you are not very familiar with biology and genetics, it will be slow going. This is not really a popular-level book, any more than Stephen Jay Gould's ""Ontogeny and Phylogeny"" is a popular-level book.Now if the reincarnation of Lewis Thomas presents this material someday, THAT would be a popular-level book!"
3,If only Matt Ridley wrote this book...,"Fascinating topic, well researched I'm sure but could the writing be more dense, more wooden, less engaging? A better bet might be Sean B. Carroll's ""Endless Forms Most Beautiful"" though even there I felt the sheer magic of what is being relayed doesn't come through. Not a good choice for a novice with no background in genetics, not that it's too technical, just too thin on examples.I look forward to the likes of Matt Ridley or Richard Dawkins tackling Evolutionary Development as the mind-blowing coolness of how embryos develop from almost nothing to, well, me and you deserves a real power-hitter in the popular science genre.But until then it's worth the effort (yes it is some effort) to skim the surface of this fascinating new frontier in biology."
4,Books on books !,"As far as books on books go,this a pretty good effort.Although it is what I call an ""edited"" book,and in the main part is an assemblage of a lot of bits and pieces.It doesn'nt pretend to be anything more than that.Donaldson has included something of intrest for everyone who loves books and reading.One thing that I have trouble with is the picture of the author holding a book which looks like a much bigger than the 128 page copy I have.Could this be the promise of a much larger next edition--I hope so! e-mail me if anyone knows,Thanks."
1,Not for the intended purpose,"I bought this book for an eleven-year-old, and am glad I checked it thoroughly before giving it. The chapter on breeding and birth is MUCH TOO GRAPHIC for children, and the same information could have been presented without the photos. Very disappointed, in that the review of the book prior to purchase gave no hint that the segment was included in such a graphic nature."
1,"Good in Dog Care, Poor in Dog Breeds","No doubt, Dr Bruce Fogle may be a good vet - BUT is he an experienced/proffesional dog trainer or behaviourist? NO! Simple theory. He features many rare breeds, and wrote profiles about them in this book. BUT ask yourself, do you think he had the chance to interact with these breeds in sufficient numbers to make judgements about them?I guess he is just took all this info (about the breeds) from some downright stupid book/website.Just read Paws to Consider written by America's Top Dog Trainers. They mentioned that Corgis were very smart and very trainable. Raising Rover written by a dog trainer/behaviourist mentioned that Corgis wanted to please and learn, and were good with kids too.PS: EVERYONE OUT THERE REMEMBER - HE'S A VET - NOT A DOG TRAINER OR BEHAVIOURISTWANNA BOOK ON DOG CARE AND HEALTH - GET HIS BOOK WANNA BOOK ON BREEDS - GET PAWS TO CONSIDER AND RAISING ROVER"
4,Gift to my Grand Daughter,I was very impressed by the coverage of the different types of dogs and their particular traits; the pictures are also large and beautifully rendered.
5,A Favorite Reference,"I understand the complaints of lack of detail on each breed. For those of us who have owned dogs for many a year this book is a great over-view - well put together and informative when choosing our next companion. Though it lacks full detail on each breed, its breadth (not just in number of breeds but in history, care, physiology, and why such an animal has this specific set of needs) far outweighs the detail. This book is a great starting point - upon finding a breed that you think will suit you, then research it further by perhaps finding a breed specific book or reading up online."
2,Disappointed,"Although I enjoy the Dorling Kindersly books because of their beautiful layout and illustrations I am disappointed in the content of the breed descriptions in this book.The book is (as is typical in books describing the different dog breeds) divided into different types of dogs dependent upon their ancestry or the type of work that they were bred to do and I found some glaring errors in this area. For example, the American Water Spaniel is listed as a 'scent hound' as is the Doberman Pinscher. The Puli is listed under 'Sporting' or 'Gundog' Breeds. The entry for the Irish Water Spaniel says that an alternate name for the breed is the 'Parti-colored Setter' which makes no sense as it is neither parti-colored nor a setter. I also find listing poodles and dalmations after 'random-bred' is confusing."
2,"General information, but it does cover rare breeds","This book is useful as a reference and for finding information on rare breeds not recognized by the AKC, but the lack of in depth information outweighs that benefit. It's great for a quick breed overview and photos, but really only useful for children and newbies."
3,Good book,"This book was a OK dog book. They have over 400 dog breeds, but they don't tell alot about each dog. For an example one dog may have a HALF of page worth of information - and another dog has two pages worth. To me, that's not very fair. Like I said before, it's an OK dog book."
2,Rat Terrier Information is extreamly off base,"Hello, i have read the description for the Rat Terrier in the newest The Encyclopedia of the Dog. I have to say that i am supremely disappointed and i am even insulted. I have been breeding Rat Terriers of 16 years. They are not hyperactive. They are not overcharged. Rat Terriers are 2 times MELLOWER than a jack russel, not the reverse. I wonder where they did their research? I have been involved with a couple of other publishing efforts that have contacted a number of knowledgeable Rat Terrier breeders BEFORE publishing. I wish DK had taken these steps.Julia Kleutsch www.poochville.com pooch@aa.net Historian National Rat Terrier Assoc. Sec/Tres Rats Reign Rat Terrire Club Member American Rat Terrier Assoc."
3,"Good, but only one problem ....","As dog encylopedias go, Dr. Fogle's is a good one with succinct text and good photos ... nice summations of each breed; however, found the information on the Eurasier breed to be inaccurate. First,the Eurasier comes from the offspring of a male chow and female keeshond,which was then bred with a samoyed. Dr. Fogle stated the breed comes from a chow, samoyed, wolfspitz mix. In fact, the wolfspitz was not part of the final mix. The keeshond/samoyed gives the Eurasier it's lovely,gentle temperment ... the only item from its chow heritage is the distinct black tongue and muzzle. Having researched this breed extensively and meeting with various owners, the comment ""not a family dog .... snappy .... one-person"" couldn't be farther from the truth. In all our research, every other book described this breed as gentle, social and family oriented ... they were right!"
3,Okay shovel,"It does what it needs to in the snow but has trouble cutting through if there is a little ice on the pavement. You have to break up the ice first with something else to shovel it up, it is just a little too flimsy for that. Over all it was a very reasonable price and we see no need to upgrade."
2,mark's written better...,i'm pretty disapointed here having read all of mark's work. 'what on earth is going on' is his masterpiece. read it.
5,Lovely Book,I ordered The Space Child's Mother Goose for the wonderful drawings but when I received it I read the book in one sitting because the poems were so delightful I couldn't put it down.
4,splendid,"The Space Child's Mother Goose what a fantastic book for children, it would've been the number one choice had it not been for ""folk of Feodora's Lane"" which is exceptionally the best book since the first harry potter- my daughters own words, but please buy the both books which i have done, well done to all involved."
1,Good pictures but VERY deceptive title.,"Although it seemed that the photographer favored the Palm Cockatoo, all of the pictures were excellent. As to the rest of the book, I was very discourraged. There was only a short and very concise section at the end of the book that delt with ""Taming and Training Cockatoos."""
2,Novelty Item,"Science Fiction is a passion of mine and since this book has been treated as such I feel it is appropriate for me to review it. Because of the mass quanities of information about this book and the Study Group's findings, I found myself saying, ""I already know that"" when I was reading it. Because information on the war is constantly being updated and reassessed this type of report in book form seems outdated so in my opinion readers are much better off keeping up with details on diplomacy and troop deployment strategies from bloggers and pundits than buying this book. However as a novely item in your library for house parties I say go for it."
5,Concise and well-written -- every American needs to read this book!,"With less than a hundred pages there's no reason not to read this book. It's timely, important, and very well-written. It summarizes the facts without becoming partisan. Years from now, this book will be seen as an important political document, even if our President seems to be ignoring it. Every American should read this book to get a better understanding of where our tax money is going and what we can do to put an end to our troop losses."
3,I Agree; Nothing New,"The earlier reviewer provided an apt description, those informed will gleaned nothing novel. Not only are their no 'mag solutions"" there are no organic applications of what is presently transpiring. Perhpas pixie dust would work but denying a US proxy war ongoing with both Iran and the Palestinian Authority isn't going to elucidate anything."
1,What should have happened 3 years ago,Another common-sense book that could have been written by any American voter with a functioning brain. A perfect companion to the 9/11 Report. Soon to come: 2008: Why Our Democracy is Dead.
3,At least this is a new plan!,"This report provides a new plan for how to win in Iraq. It probably will not work, but it would have been worth a chance. It is too bad that President Bush is blind to the needs for our country and failure of his war."
1,I'm confused...,"Does anyone have a problem with people profiting from a study done with our tax dollars on a war where our countrymen and women are being killed everyday? Not to mention that this study was done to find out exactly how much our government had screwed up. Is this a joke?We as Americans own this and countless amounts of other information that we are either outright denied or charged a fee to access. Knowledge is power, you do the math."
3,Campy but fun,"I've always thought Disney movies were fun. Not usually thought provoking, but fun. This was no exception, and I'd highly recommend it as a good natured family film."
4,"""We are who we are""","This is the kind of album that anyone can relate to. Each song with its indiviual yet simliar sounds. The most unique songs i have heard in a while, something really refreshing. Soft Bomb Salad is by far my favourtie, the lyrics are terribly amazing. In fact, each songs lyrics are much different but quite more optimistic then previous albums. It is however a much more intense and dark, but in every sense 'happy'. Each song is sung with such passion and care, that it makes you want to ehtier just relax or rock out on your own. A very personal endeavour."
4,"Really good album, something of a departure from previous efforts.","This is a really good album. I was curious if I Mother Earth did anything after Edwin left, and the answer was clearly yes. This album features a heavier approach to music than we saw previously, although in many ways, there is a very obvious Janes Addiction sensibility to many of the songs. I find this particularly interesting since te last time i saw these guys play (for the Scenery & Fish tour), and hung out afterwards, reporters kept referencing Janes when they were interviewing the guys, a comparison that was pissing them off at the time...and yet here we are a two albums later and the alleged influence has become a reality, lol. Not a bad thing at all, and the majority of this can be attributed to Byrne's voice, which at times sounds a bit Perry Ferrell. Anyway, the album is really good. I think i prefer the Edwin albums, but you really cant go wrong anytime you have Jag ripping on the guitar.Enjoy!"
2,what happened?!?,"what happened to ime? this new stuff sounds like something i could hear on one of the many crap stations on the radio....good melodies, but all simple sounding and no depth whatsoever!! andwhat happened to the percussion?!?!?? and the guitars are all distortion with barely any clear channel sound and an almost complete lack of any thought out leads with feeling! way too industrial sounding. a waste of talent if you ask me. the best thing about this album is the mix!--a disgruntled fan"
2,TQMD should never have been,"There were too many years between Blue Green Orange, I Mother Earth's greatest album, and The Quicksilver Meat Dream; and it wasn't worth the wait. The mood and atmosphere created on TQMD seems forced and artificial. I was really disappointed upon hearing the album-- there is not a glimmer of that spacey, progressive sound they harbored for three other albums. Instead you get half-baked effort that tries to emulate Tool at every turn, and falls miserably short. However, one of the best IME tracks can be found on this disc-- Soft Bomb Salad-- but it's still not enough to redeem the rest of the album. IME has lost their momentum, as shown by TQMD and their live performances of late."
2,what happened?!?,"what happened to ime? this new stuff sounds like something i could hear on one of the many crap stations on the radio....good melodies, but all simple sounding and no depth whatsoever!! ANDwhat happened to the percussion?!?!?? and the guitars are all distortion with barely any clear channel sound, and an almost complete lack of any thought out leads with any feeling! way too industrial sounding. big turn for the worst if you ask me. the best thing about this album is the mix!--a disgruntled fan"
4,informative,I greatly enjoyed this book. I'd read a book many years ago about Bannister but hadn't been more than vaguely aware of the other two runners vying to be first to break the four minute barrier. Bascomb does a fine job of presenting each runner's character and experiences as their running careers progress and intertwine. I'd say if you have any sort of love for running or sports you'll find this a worthwhile read.
5,Amazing read,"Such an enjoyable read. I had no idea as to all of the players surrounding this amazing human accomplishment. I was sad when the book ended. For a runner, or simply a person who enjoys reading about the ""impossible"" being possible, this is the book to read. One of my all time favorite running books, by a long shot."
3,This is no Seabiscuit!,"I was very disappointed. While the book is well written, it is less than compelling to read about countless races (each essentially the same as the others) in which the 4 minute mile is once again NOT broken. The drama and thrill of broken lives, redemption, setbacks and heartbreak and ultimate victory that one found in Seabiscuit are just not there. There is simply not much of a story to recount."
1,There are plenty of better books,"I couldn't ven finish the book. Definetely very dry and boring. I would recommend ""Ultramarathon Man"" any day over this book. Look for Dean Karnazes."
2,Probably a Better Movie than Book,"What a great idea for a book. Three runners from different backgrounds and countries each competing to be the first man to run a four minute mile. I really wanted to like this book more than I did. After many, many pages detailing training, training, adn more training I began to skim in ernest.By the time the featured race was run, I was all out of steam. I cannot put my finger on just what is wrong with the book other than it is really dry and boring. Maybe if the author had gotten more into the personalities and less into the training regimens. Anyway, somewhere they say it is ""soon to be a major motion picture"". Mabye the movie will be better."
5,A refreshing new read,"This is a wonderful book on the short history of the attempt to beat the four minute mile. This is the intertwined story of three mean, one American, one Englishmen and an Australian who set out to break the world record in a variety of contests. This book profiles other famous runners and explores running theory and why it was that so many considered it physically impossible to break the threshold. Nevertheless this is a surprisingly refreshing look at the world of running and pushing to envelope in history making speed records. Definitely worth a read.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,OK read,A little slow in places but I am glad I stuck with it to the end before returning it to the library.
2,Whatever Happened to Anton?,"I was so excited to get this book that I picked it up and basically refused to put it down until I was done. When I did put it down, however, I was just left angry.I mean, in ""Summer of My German Soldior"", the character Anton was so nice, and friendly, and had psychological depth. But in ""Morning Is a Long Time Coming"", the character Roger was just an annoying, shallow French guy with a one-track mind.Also, in the sequel, Patty seems less mature then when she was twelve. She seems to have gone backwards, and now has the maturity of a two-year-old. She has forgotten practically everything Anton has taught her. And what ever happened to the ring he gave her? Did she lose it? Forget about it? What?Anyway, I would only recommend this book to someone who hated the first one. Because it seems to me that everyone who loved the first book, hated the second."
2,stereotype of the sequel,"In the sequel to Summer of My German Soldier, Patty Bergen journeys (against her parents' wishes--what else is new?) to Europe with the intention of visiting the family of Anton, whom she sheltered during WWII. In Europe, Patty encounters various people, particularly romantic encounters. She must grow away from her dependence on men like her abusive and controlling father, away from her need and desire for a mother, through her stomach issues, and into her own. Unfortunately, the story is slow and uninteresting. Although thoroughly introspective, Patty really doesn't have anything new to say. Things that were appropriate for a teenager seem winy for an adult. The sequel lacks the complexities, personal and interpersonal, and the dramatic excitement of the first novel. Grade: C+"
3,Patty is ready to travel and get away from her family.,"Patty Bergen returns in the sequel to Summer of my German Soldier as an eighteen-year-old. She leaves her mentally and physically abusive family behind to find the parent's of her dead ""Nazi friend."" Before she goes to find her dead friend's parents, she goes to France where she falls in love with a man named Roger. Suddenly she leaves Roger to go on her hunt. I liked the first book better because it has more actions and emotions than this one."
2,HOW DISAPPOINTING!,"Okay, this was pretty lame compared to SUMMER OF MY GERMAN SOLDIER. You have to read it to know what I'm talking about. There're are all these stupid conversations and arguments. And I know I shouldn't say this, especially since a lot of peeps haven't read the book, but when Patty gets to Anton's house his mother is dead so she just leaves. CAN'T PATTY TAlK WITH ANTON'S FATHER??? This really doesn't make sense. I mean, even if all she was searching for was a ""real mother,"" Patty still could have told Mr. Reiker who she was so that he'd know, not just walk away!!! This was a very disappointing book, but I gotta say, if you've read SUMMER OF MY GERMAN SOLDIER, you have to read this, just to know what happens."
2,Can't say much,"This book was such a disappointment. I bought it, mainly because I already had the previous novel, The Summer of My German Soldier.There are small facts and details which are wrong and don't follow on from the first novel. Also it moved way too slow, and she did spend too much time in France (she was meant to be going to Germany to meet Anton's family and there was only about a chapter on that).The first novel was fresh and new about a girl who hide a German soldier from being discovered after he escaped from the the prisonor of war camp. I recommend that you read the first one, but not this one."
3,"NOT ONLY DID IT TAKE TOO LONG, BUT MORINING NEVER CAME","Well, this book was pretty dissapointing according to the prequel. When I picked it up, I expected to find some innocent romance, and lots of reading about Germany. But, what I found was somewhat different. Read this, and you'll find that Patty has some immoral moments(and consider the reading level too!), and way too much time in Paris, and not enough in Germany. The book was way good accept for those points. I really liked the background info as far as that goes. I would NOT highly reccommend this, but if you can stand immorality, then go ahead and read it!"
1,Such a disappointment,"""Summer of My German Soldier"" is one of my all-time favorite books, which made ""Morning is a Long Time Coming"" an even bigger disappointment. The main character, Patty, has gone from an engaging and sympathetic lead character to a shallow and, quite frankly, annoying one.The story starts out well enough, with Patty coming of age and deciding to follow through on her search for Anton's family and the reactions of her town and immediate family. But the story begins to go downhill once she leaves for France. The plot is slow, full of uninteresting characters and even less interesting plotlines. Even the ending is a confusing disappointment and leaves readers feeling cheated.A book that was better off not written."
4,Pretty Good! :),"When I started reading Morning is a Long Time Coming, I was a little upset... It had the same characters, but was very different from Summer of My German Soldier. I can completely understand why several people in these reviews have written they were let down-- at first, I was too. But then something dawned on me: The sequel takes place 6 or so years later from Summer of My German Soldier... of course it's going to be different... I thought this was a very good book, one that you definitely should read after Summer of My German Soldier... You basically have to!"
3,A great book about a girl who's trying to follow her dream.,"This is the compelling sequel to Summer of My German Soldier. Since the second I started reading Morning Is A Long Time Coming I was intrigued. Morning Is A Long Time Coming is about a girl named Patty, who wants to fufill her dream. Her dream is to go to Germany to meet the love of her life's mother. On the way she meets a frenchman named Roger, who tries to make her realize it's not right for her to go to Germany to meet this stranger. Does she go to Germany? You'll have to read this book to find out.I thought Morning Is A Long Time Coming was a very good book but it did have a few slow moments. I liked how the book had vivid description however it wasn't too abstract. I would suggest you read this book after you read the prequel, Summer Of My German Soldier, so you understand Patty's intense emotions. I hope you enjoy reading this powerful book as much as I did!"
2,Morning didn't come this time,"I couldn't wait to read this sequel to one of my favorite books, ""Summer of my German Soldier"". However, I was left disappointed and questioning. I'd rate it 2.5 stars, if that were possible. Patty seemed immature. I will give her kudos for blowing off the people who shunned her, including her parents. I hoped for high adventure when she disobeyed her parents and took a trip to Europe. But she and Roger, her boyfriend, had silly arguements, and she spent too much time in France with him. I know she loved him, but shouldn't she have been anxious to talk to Anton's relatives? Why didn't she try to begin a relationship with them? The ending was semi-inspirational, but not really satisfying. What about her and Roger? Did she ever go back to America? I thought she'd want to see Ruth again. Read this book only if you really want to know what happens to Patty."
5,Morning Is A Long Time Coming,"It has been six years since the summer that changed Patty Bergen's life forever- the summer she sheltered Anton, an escaped German POW. Her high school graduation should mark a new beginning, but Patty cannot face her future until she comes to terms with her pst. She decides to go to Germany in search of Anton's mother, desperate for a connection to the man she loved and lost. En route, she stops in Paris, where she meets Roger. And now she must think twice about her plan-not only because of what she might find, but because of what she must leave behind...."
3,"Good, yet disappointing","This book was ok. I really really really did NOT like the ending though. You never find out if she marries Roger or if she stays in Paris or if she goes to college or if she gets a job! And the REALLY dumb part was when she left Anton's house just because his mother was dead! Can't he talk with the father? Sometimes I really did't understand Patty and her overexaggerated emotions. But, if you have read the first book and you wish to find out what happens to Patty read this. Don't expect anything great."
4,not as good as prequel...,This book was very interesting and exciting. It told the story of Patty Beregen who went to Europe in search of Anton's relatives only to find Roger in Paris. Now she must decide if it is worth it to go on to Germany after Roger loves her and lives with her. I thought this book wasnt as exciting as Summer of my German Soilder but it certainly was worth reading.
1,"DON""T BUY FROM GLOBAL MUSIC","I purchased this item through Amazon. It was being sold by another vendor, someone called global music. They sent me an email saying the product had shipped but I never received it. I checked the tracking number global music provided but it came back as untraceable. I emailed them twice via amazon's email feedback system but they never replied. Fortunately, I emailed amazon and they did the right thing by refunding the purchase.Since I never received this item, I can not comment about it. I can definitely say DO NOT BUY FROM GLOBAL MUSIC!!!!! They are LYING SACKS OF XXXXXX! Hopefully, amazon will do the right thing again and remove them from their site!"
2,Attention!!! this is NOT a Harry Nilsson album!!!,another swedish pop-rock band who sounds like cardigans but the female vocalist is never as sexy or as genious as Nina Person has become. i bought it once and enjoyed in driving car back home twice. i would not reccomend it though thery're not that bad.
5,Freddie's Garden is top notch,This cd contains great music by an amazing artist. Harry Nilsson brings out emotions in me that I have not felt since a child. Listen to this album at anytime. I recomend all the time.
4,My review,"This is a small very big book, shows how the sintesis of a graphic can be clear and great."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this book to read on a plane trip. It was so bad, so boring I quickly found myself watching the clouds. I was much more entertained."
2,All the elements are there....but,"I have to agree with the other reviewers on the separate elements of this book. However, they didn't seem to come together to make this a compelling read. I found myself skimming through many parts to get to the meat of the story. I could not connect with the characters and didn't really care about them. I am a fan of both P.N. Elrod and this genre and tried hard to like this book but in the end could not."
4,Man Overboard and The Other One (nice 2-fer).,"""The Other One"" (1979) #105Released late 1979, ""The Other One"", has some good tracks in, ""Rebel Rouser"", the single ""Love Came 2X"", nice little title Bob! His Fleetwood Mac cover ""Future Games"" and ""Spanish Dancers"". Not as compelling as his first 2 solo's, but it has some good moments. ***1/2.""Man Overboard"" (1980) #162Bob's 4th solo ""Man Overboard"", is fairly strong, you get, The great title track, ""Nightmare"", ""Justine"", ""B666"", ""The Girl Can't Stop"", the single ""Don't Rush The Good Things"" and ""Those Days Are Gone"". 31 years later still one of Bob's best. ****."
3,Took a while to get,"I bought this CD for one song that can't be bought or downloaded anywhere. I loved it as a kid. Didn't get the CD for over 3 weeks for some reason. The rest of the CD's music content should be labeled ""See Bob Welsh's Career Slide"" - pretty mediocre. But hey, there's my one song and it's great."
5,Good to know the media is on our side!,"Yes, if you read this book you can tell that review title was dripping with sarcasm. This book gives accounts of how the government and the corporations kept certain ""BIG"" stories from appearing in the news are flat out discrediting them through shotty corporate owned journalism. A recommend read for news junkies."
2,"Freedom of the press, another version","This book contains a series of essays by investigative journalists detailing some of their successes but mostly failures in getting some of their more controversial pieces published.It is a spotty work. The paranoia of some essays leap out at the reader from every page; others are more reasoned and convincing. Some of the essays make valid points, but the underlying elitism turned me off.The book's major villain is capitalism, profits being the dirty word that prevents the various authors from imposing their version of truth reality and importance on the idiots who have the temerity to disagree.In the hands of most of the essayists, the constitutional right to a free press has somehow been transformed into a constitutional requirement that all newspapers must publish not what the majority of its readers want to read, but what self styled elitist literati feel should be fed to the public.While an interesting read, the book can't be taken seriously."
4,VX8100 Data Cable,"This product is exactly what i needed to access the file system of my LG VX8100, the item shipped and was here in a timely manner."
2,"Good Titles, Not So Good Execution","This refers to CD number: RCA 07863-52469-2On swamptree.com, this CD is panned due to electronic reprocessing.Jamaica Farewell is not the same as the itunes version and does not sound original."
4,35 Years Later,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've heard (and read) all the criticisms of Elvis' management and the Camden albums before. I'm not saying that some of it isn't justified, but c'mon, it's been 35 years or more since the Camden albums were released. Get over it!! Just sit back and enjoy the music.If you still remember how. All the other ""stuff"" doesn't matter now."
4,burning love and hits from his movies,THE CORRECT TITLE WITH THE SONGS LISTED IS BURNING LOVE AND HITS FROMHIS MOVIES VOLUME 2
5,I acted in it and I think it is wonderful.,"Plaza Suite, in neil simon style, combines real life messages and upbeat comedy. All three acts show a peak to life and Neil Simon's genius in bringing the characters to life. I was Muriel when I performed in it. I do have a bias, but I have also studied the script in great detail. I am directing Act 2 this year and I chose it for it's heart and comedy. Plaza suite is interesting, funny, and bound to leave you with a good feeling. Even though you see the characters in one setting, you explore many different parts of their lives. The play is character driven, in neil simon fashion and I recommend this to anyone who wants to read a mixture of real-life and comedy. Other Neil Simon play's I recommend are: The Good Doctor, Rumors, London Suite, Sunshine Boys, Brighton Beach Memoirs, and of course Biloxi Blues."
3,story is good but VHS transfer is unacceptable,"I got a VHS copy of this from Amazon and it is recorded in ""EP"" (the middle speed on your VCR, and some VCRs won't even play EP tapes). The tracking was all over the place (distorting the picture AND sound), so even if you got it right, a few minutes later it would change....VERY annoying distraction! There is a DVD version out there, but it is way overpriced right now."
1,A complete disaster!,"If you're like me, you probably wanted to check out this movie because it sounded like it really could be an excellent supernatural Gothic horror tale full of goblins and wicked things alike. Well, don't make the same mistake I did and actually watch it. It's horrible. Terrible. An honest to goodness waste of film. The acting is wretched, the film quality is rotten (it actually looks twenty years older than it is), and the plot is thin, weak, and does not give you what it's supposed to. The only reason I bothered to give this film 1 star is because of Alexis Arquette -- he's great looking, but should have left this film out of his career."
1,Jack Be Fumbled,"Glum film tries too hard as adopted blood siblings reunite later in life. He has a hypnotizing machine, an attitude, and four angry sisters after him, she is psychic and pregnant. Brooding and dark, dull and silly."
3,Good collection of Civil War songs,"I bought this at a Civil War battlefield a few years ago on a whim. It has the necessities, ""Dixie"" (a banjo rendition) and ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"". The best are the folksy bluegrass tracks, particularly ""Cumberland Gap"" and ""Brother Green"". The singing is a bit amateurish but it's tolerable. ""Home Sweet Home"" and ""Listen to the Mockingbird"" are great instrumental tracks, it's clear they had some talented banjo and fiddle players participating. Overall, it's a pretty enjoyable album, especially if you want a better taste of Civil War era life."
3,"Go for broke , buy the albums!","As I have a library of Vangelis, which includes all these tracks...This compilation is firmly rooted in the 70's & 80's, fortunately Vanglis' musical talents overshadows the ""boing-bong-dink"" sound that most electronic music of those eras. There's no keyboard cha-cha-cha or samba rhythms here. Vangelis' intelligent compositions make him a one-man genre. This compilation is a exhibition of selected pieces with a common theme, space, by association if not content.<b>So then why this disc?</b>What this compilation fails to deliver are the pinacles that Vangelis has achieved in music, the eclectic genius that you find in the albums. A disservice to fans and new listeners who will better be served by the Vangelis compilations: Themes, Portraits and Reprise."
5,Is the treasure real?,"_Los_Santos_ is part mystery and part adventure story, based on a legend of pirate treasure. It is set mainly in the very recent past. There are enough facts in the story that the reader is drawn easily into the fiction. The author has created realistic as well as a few colorful characters that show how greed can quickly consume one's being. There were parts of this novel where the suspense was so great that I could not read the words nor turn the pages fast enough; this rarely occurs when I read a novel. I look forward to more works by the author."
1,*WAS* the best value - not anymore,"Quite a shock to see the price jump up from just under $20 all the way to $28.92. Quess they've figured out how to get around that ""free"" shipping. Not very nice."
4,Great Value,"This a very good protein. Its best attributes are good taste, great nutritional value, and the fact that you get so much bang for your buck (5 lbs for about 2/3 of the price of many other brands). If you're not used to Whey protein, just make sure you start out easy (one serving a day for the first few days), and then increase use as you see fit. Some people experience a little bloating when using this type of protein for the first time.All in all, a great value... and pretty good tasting protein."
2,Not particularly tasty,"If you like to just mix up protein powder in water and drink it straight up, I wouldn't go near this stuff. Not too tasty. However, if you're looking for something inexpensive to mix into a smoothie, this might not be too objectionable. Personally, I take my protein powder with water or milk, and I wound up giving this stuff away to a friend who makes elaborate breakfast smoothies."
3,Good book but hate kindle edition,Like seriously I'm wondering if these people can count after buying the kindle edition I became so pissed off at the constant repeating of page numbers that I couldn't even finish the book!!!! Since I paid full price I'd expect a good page count kmt. Seriously y'all need to do better how can someone manage time if they don't truly know how many pages they are reading???!?
4,As vital as ever!,"Thorne shows us how children learn & utilize gender through how and what they play in the school setting. I was delighted to see that children today still engage in the ""cooties"" game....that's something that MY generation played in the late 60's! I felt Thorne was right on target with what she saw and how she perceived it! Every educator, parent or anybody interested in how children perceive gender should read this book!"
3,Just okay,This product was not as sturdy as I'd hoped it was going to be. It also looked a little cheap to me as the dividers are made of simple cardboard.
2,"BAD CONSTRUCTION, BAD, BAD BAD.......","We already had what I thought was the same product as this one, but apparently they changed the way it is made from the one we bought 2 years ago. All of the shelves are plain cardboard like the one we already had but the way the shelves are held in place is the worst design that I have ever seen. It took 2 of us, who have over 50 years of equipment construction experience between us, way to long to assemble this product and most of the shelves are still uneven. The unit we bought before did not use metal clips that keep falling out while you are trying to put it together. They had to be held in with double stick tape to keep them from falling out and are very hard to keep in place while you are trying to assemble it. The unit is still usable for what our needs are, but I would not purchase this product again and would not recommend that anyone else ever buy this product."
1,Anything but a value.,"I'm usually accepting of design and quality problems, depending on price, but the Safco 7121 Value Sorter brings both of these qualities to a new low. I put it together for someone in our office, and felt the need to review it to warn people.The shelves are cardboard. Not ""fiber board,"" unless cardboard falls into that distinction in your mind. It doesn't for me. The plastic pieces that are put on the sides and ends of the shelves are flimsy and offer little strength to the shelves.I recommend this product as a definite ""avoid."""
2,constraction material not as expected,"Very disappointed with the storage compartments, they are made of cardboard and the specification when i ordered them were: ""The storage compartments are formed of heavy-duty corrugated fiberboard with a solid hardwood fiberboard back to ensure stability and durability"". There is no way that these compartments will hold 550 sheets without collapsing. Your message was very misleading."
3,An Eclectic Taste in Steam,"I bought the book while on a business trip because it had a short article on the Eritrean Railway. I found it had a diverse collection of today's steam along with a few historical items. It is divided into many short articles. The articles are sucinct and enjoyable. They give the reader insights into the pictures. However, it is fundametally a picture book. Considering its goal, I could have given it a higher rating had it had an index or annotated table of contents. This would allow the reader go back and find an article of interest. I found most of the article titles cryptic."
4,A good introduction to Bluegrass using Walt Disney songs,"I was pleasantly suprised by this CD. It could have been unknown musicians playing standard studio licks, or worse, a silly stereotype like the Country Bears Jamboree. Instead, it is a well-planned, all instrumental album with lots of appeal to adults & kids alike ! All of the songs are from Walt Disney movies, both classic and recent films. The most toe-tapping tunes are 'Zip-a-dee-doo-dah'and 'You ain't never had a friend like me'. The rendition of 'When you wish upon a star' features poignant fiddle work. My only compliant about this album is the short length, only 12 songs. This is the perfect CD for the long drive to Walt Disney World, perhaps followed by ""The Best of Country Sing the Best of Disney"" (WD Records 60902-7)."
4,Works fine,"You get what you pay for, I bought a $35 ukulele. It plays fine just needed new strings, the nut was a little high too. Plays fine"
4,Disagree with critics,"When Jean Seberg starred in Saint Joan, her first movie, the critics gave her thoroughly negative reviews. Being that this was her first movie and that Otto Preminger was a very demanding and harsh director to work with, I would have thought that the critics and the public would have been more sympathetic. I decided to view this movie with curiosity and some trepidation. I was pleasantly surprised. I believe Ms. Seberg did a very good job, considering she had no experience in movies. The fault I found with this picture was the script. I found it to be rather silly and immature, considering the subject matter.I would recommend this movie to any Jean Seberg fan."
3,"Not a baby book, but still for younger readers","I don't know why this book is catalogued as a ""baby-preschool"" book, while simple, I find the image of babies trying to learn FORTRAN rather humorous. The intended audience is probably grade schoolers without much familiarity with computers (an increasing rarity). The first chapter goes through a brief introduction to input/output, compilers, etc. But then it goes right into the basics of a program. It covers no advanced topics."
4,Good Intentions Count,"This is a self produced and handled product and as such it has good intentions and is, for the most part, worth the money. I intend to spend next winter on the gulf coast in my RV and his supplied a lot of good information. My only complaint is that the folks who made this did so right after Hurricane Katrina had hit the gulf coast and they spent much of their time on that. While I admire that, the information is now several years out of date and can easily be skipped. But all in all this is the only information in one place about this wonderful RV drive and I don't regret spending the money at all."
5,University book,"I used this book for a class at a university. It was the required text book and served me well toward getting an A. For a foundational book, there's nothing wrong with it. The only problem with it was that I could not resell it at the end of the semester because they considered it to be ""outdated"" at that time."
5,Book,"Came right on time, little bit worn on the cover but, & some markings but hey its better than nothing."
5,A really good expansion that adds new rules to the game.,"I was skeptical when I bought this, but after using it have determined this is one awesome expansion to the Fifth Age RPG, it contains new rules for creating armies, defining roles, new weapons, and tons of other kewl stuff! Out of the Fifth Age expansions, I'd say this is one of the best."
3,Homemade Handbook,"This book is VERY homemade by Ms Graf. The typeset is tiny. Apparently she was her own editor and publisher. There are many, many gramatical errors in this book. She typed ""you"" instead of ""your"" page after page. Content is okay. Nothing you couldn't learn if you have spent any time on ebay yourself. I was pleased of the resources she lists in the book to help get you started in the right direction for selling on ebay. Plus, she does give simplistic instructions for a beginner on ebay. If you can overlook the gramatical errors and the non-professional printing, this book does contain some information that might help a beginner."
1,Horrible,"This album was a waste of money. If you want true death metal spend your money on Nile, or Cyptopsy not this weak garbage."
4,Magnifier,"Works great...had to fiddle the attachment to our existing verilux lamp, but it makes needlepoint and fine modeling work much easier!"
3,Magnifer,"We thought that having a magnifier on a lamp would be useful. The magnifier is powerful, but having it on the lamp pole so that it just slides up and down isn't very useful, at least to us It's hard to position it so that it magnifies what you're looking at on your desk. Maye it would be better in a tool room."
5,sock repair,It was great to be able to attach it so easily to my old Verilux lamp. It works beautifully and allowed me to repair socks that I hadn't been able to repair because I couldn't see where to put the needle!!
3,Odd but well intended,"This collection of stories, reminiscences, poems, songs, from famous authors and show-biz folks hangs on a thin thread of ""thankfulness"" to unify its contents. Sometimes, it's just not quite enough. Good stories by JonScieszka, Whoopi Goldberg, Tiger Woods, Kate DeCamillo (Winn Dixie), and cute songs (CD is good too) redeem the weaker entries. This will be heavily promoted because its royalties go to St. Jude's Hospital and media campaign starts right after football on T-Day. It would make a nice present for your child's dentist or doctor for the waiting room--all the stories are short and sweet."
2,Incomplete CD very disappointing,"As several other reviewers stated, the CD included with the book is NOT the complete CD that is available separately. The CD was the part I was most excited about and I feel like I wasted the express shipping fee to get it here in time for the long car ride with the kids for the Thanksgiving holiday. I feel a little silly for not reading the reviews thoroughly. Had I done that, I would have known the CD only has three songs on it versus the 20 on the regular disc. Lesson learned!"
5,The Reivers,"Picaresque, whimsical tale benefits from Rydell's warm yet keen sense of nostalgia in portraying a charmingly innocent period, not to mention a refreshingly atypical McQueen performance as a sweet, lovable rogue. Inspired, light-hearted support from co-star Crosse earned him an Oscar nod, along with John Williams's jaunty score. (Note: though the motley trio do spend time in a Memphis ""bawdy house"", the sequence is handled with sufficient delicacy to make the movie appropriate for older children.)"
5,They don't make them like this anymore,"They finally put this wonderful movie on DVD. An easy, kick-back movie to enjoy about a boy growing up in slower times in the early 1900's in the South. It touches on a wide variety of human traits, from foibles such as discrimination and deceit to good qualities like respect and forgiveness. The stable scene about quitting is a terrific lesson for all of us and especially for youngsters. The basement scene between the grandfather and the boy (""I could smell the starch in his shirt"") is a priceless teaching tool without using the strap. Simple and straightforward with a little comedy sprinkled throughout with wonderful narration by Burgess Meredith, you feel pleasantly satisfied at the end that you just finished watching a great movie."
1,The Reivers,"I ordered this movie as a Christmas present so it has not been viewed to date. I noticed on the outside of the case, it was assembled in Mexico. I do not understad that but hope it turns out okay."
2,The reivers,"This is not one of McQueen's stellar films. I remembered it as being much better when it was in the theates than it is. Today this kind of movie wouldnt have an audience unless Disney made it. It's so simplistic, it's almostboring. It's like ""HUD"" on prosaic."
5,delightful and heart warming,This movie is much better than the book. The story is heart warming and very entertaining
4,DJ,I remember seeing this when it first came out and I really Enjoyed it. It reminded me of some of the stories my father told me about his growing up in small town america in the early 1900's So there you have it. It was a peek into the time of my fathers youth of the early 1900's. The story you and plot has been mentioned in other reviews so there is no need to add to that except it's a great look into the past.
3,Great Horse race,"Nice story. A good lesson about growing up, proper values, right and wrong. Good acting. Steve McQueen is always easy to watch."
3,not crazy about,My two Dalmatians are not crazy about these vitamins. I bought them because of the recent problem with Pet Tabs coming from China which my dogs liked to eat and never refused. They both refuse these vitamins so to use them up I hide them in their food.
2,Taste is subjective,These vitamins look okay. They are smaller than our previous vitamins so I have to give more of them to my big dogs. The bottle doesn't last as long as you would expect with 240 tabs in the bottle. Most important -- my dogs don't like the taste.
1,Dog Won't Eat These,"I bought these for Molly, our small border collie who had previously taken Pet Tab vitamins. I thought these would be better, but I was wrong. Molly refuses to take these. If we crush and put them in her food she won't eat. Molly readily chewed the Pet Tabs and takes a chewable heartworm tablet monthly too. These went in the trash at our house. Don't waste your money."
2,Not for our dogs...,"Our Golden Retrievers, who usually eat anything that isn't moving or doesn't eat them first, spat these ""chewable"" tabs out as rapidly as possible. They must taste terrible."
1,Dog won't eat,My dog eats anything but he won't eat these vitamins. I have to crush them up and hide then in his treats.I will not waste money on these again
2,Cent Mille Chansons,"OK... My wife and I were in Manhattan having dinner at a French Restaurant. The background music was, well... background music. Then this one song started to play and we just stopped and listened. It was beautiful. The rest of the album is Greek (or French) to us, but we fell in love with Cent Mille Chansons."
3,Fair,"Black Holes and Revelations is fair. I think Origin of Symmetry and Absolution are much better, with the latter being the best effort to date. The album is a bit political. Been there, heard that. Is it just fashion that artists have to spout their political views?"
3,Showing slight wear,"3 1/2Ever-slightly, the fab 3 begin what hopefully will not be a permanent creative decent. They excel at putting together dynamic albums showcasing their bombastic brilliance, pop-rock anguish, and heavy-hitting melodics with little throw-away, and their latest was no exception. Continuing to tweak a formula upward mainly from Absolution however, presents for the first time the band blatantly ripping themselves off. Although I initially thought it was the dance-floor disco vibe which fattened the disc up, they actually pull that off rather well, like anything the band really strives for. Instead, it is the subtle extinguishing of creativity which resides throughout the disc that brings it slightly down."
3,Muse....,"They're good songwriters, good musicians, and yeah the guy's a good singer albeit Thom Yorke will always be better...The problem with this album is it's production. Way overproduced to the point that half of the backing voices are completely superfluous and in many cases, cheesy.If you're sensitive to production taste, be cautious with this one."
5,A new Muse fan,"The first I heard of Muse was in the Twilight soundtrack. Then Adam Lambert singing Starlight at an AI concert, which I loved. So I was prompted to buy this CD and I really love the sound. A lot of interesting musical combinations - especially love the sound of the heavy piano chords in some of the songs, which I personally think goes very well with the alternative rock sound. I like this CD better than their new release"
5,I'll keep this short...,"I got the cd by itself for a gift...I bought this copy with the DVD because I absolutly HAD to see how the heck they get all that music out of just 3 guys. I am not usually into concert DVD's, but this one literally ROCKS!! If you are a Muse fan, this is a must have."
4,wall of sound,"Wow, a diverse wall of sound covering everything from disco beats to progressive rock, like Queen for the new century. Incredibly talented musicians. If there are any complaints about this album, there are only one or two songs made for radio (is that a bad thing?....) Highly recommended - my favorite CD of the past year or two."
3,"Great moments, but not their best","This album has some good standouts and moments of genius, like I would expect from these guys, but some moments are a bit over the top and melodramatic. That works for them sometimes, but not in the slower songs like ""Soldier's Poem""If you want their best, go for Origin of Symmetry or Absolution."
4,Heavenly Muse-ic,This is my first true exposure to The Muse and I have to say I am just blown away by their sound. I just love the vocals and the way that the cd just naturally flows from one song the other. If you are a fan of British alternative music then I would highly recommend this cd.
4,not bad!,"this album had to grow on me, but when it did i was fairly happy. But unfortunately i can't say the same about their earlier albums, having a hard time getting past the lead singers falsetto! hardcore fans i'm sorry about the last remark, but i did dig black holes and revelations!"
4,Diversity,"I like this CD. It has a lot of Queen influence in the vocal and music department. It also has a very Art Rock approach in the music. The musicianship is amazing and always interesting. This Cd was recommended in a Prog Magazine as an album of rock with prog embellishments. I would have to agree. I'm not sure I hear the Rush influence as others have mentioned. I hear more Queen and U2. I think they should move away from the U2 and stick with the Queen influence. Whatever the case is, the CD is very enjoyable like a real good Adrian Belew CD."
4,Interesting...,"It's funny how things occur, you know? I had never heard of Muse before I went to the My Chemical Romance concert where they opened. I was pleasantly shocked. They have this Queen-like vibe that I can't get out of my head. I like several of the songs on the album, but there seems to be more misses than hits. But that's alright, considering ""Take A Bow"", ""Starlight"", and ""Knights of Cydonia"" warrant the purchase of this CD."
4,Wow,"I discovered Muse from a movie soundtrack. I had never heard of them before. This CD is amazing. There are a few songs I didn't care for, but overall, I'm in awe at the sounds they produce. Truly mindblowing melodies and fantastic harmony. It is a very political CD, so if you're squeamish about that, I can't recommend it."
5,Heartwrenchingly Beautiful Music,"So it's official, I'm in love. A friend of mine turned me onto this band and earned his stripes as my friend. His assessment was that I would either instantly love them or wonder what on earth he was thinking recommending them. It's the former, definitely the former. One of the songs was on the first Twilight soundtrack and it was the best song on that soundtrack. I also love having the entire album on my phone. Eat your heart out iTunes. Android finally has an app that not only matches iTunes for content but also surpasses them for price economy. Yay AmazonMP3"
5,Awesome!,Muse continues to be one of my favorite bands! These songs are some of their best. I am looking forward to downloading their next album.
4,never knew they existed,"tight interesting and great music, reminds me of Queen 10CC and even Deep Purple but with enough of their own style to be well worth having in any record collection"
3,Is it worth it?,"CD is awesome, and the DVD(Zone1) is just the Absolution Tour DVD, so if you have the DVD already, is it worth buying this one? If you collect all muse releases, then yes, it is worth it since its a limited edition...On the CD, I hoped there'll be a track of Glorious(to make it different from original CD, but no... Its a copy/paste of Absolution DVD and a Copy/Paste of BH&R; Audio-CD.The Jewel Case is in Blue plastic"
1,Ingenuity at it's finest,"Banal and repetetive harmonies, cheesy piano/keyboard riffs, a FAKE vocalist, a three chord wonder poser guitarist, whiny vocals and shallow lyrics.Typical mtv style trend friendly poprock for tasteless crowds. next"
5,Their most eclectic album to date,"Black Holes and Revelations is by far Muse's most eclectic album to date. It's nothing like what they've done before...Actually, they've never really repeated themselves from album to album. There is definately a more synth feel to the album. It's Prince meets Depeche Mode meets Queen meets Jimmy Page all rolled up in one beautiful album. Their crowning glory is Knights of Cydonia, which is epic and unlike anything I've ever heard. These guys really took a chance with this album. It may not be as commercial as Absolution but props to them for sticking to their guns on this one."
3,A good taste of Muse,"1 star = Worst music out there2 stars = Only for fanatics3 stars = Worth a try4 stars = A must own5 stars = Hear the divineThis is how I see the rating system: If 5 stars is the absolute best thing going, ever, in the history of music, how can so many people rate this is as 5 stars? The only 5 star albums should be the ones that have stood the test of time or the ones that have changed music as we know it. That being said, this is a decent album.This is Muse, no doubt about it. This album has great songs that could possibly be connected like a concept album or a alt-rock opera. If you are new to Muse, try Absolution first. If you liked the whole of the album then try BH&R.; If you don't like Muse at all, see them live, and be ready to tell me how great they are. Easily the best live band I have ever seen in person."
2,"""Black Holes"" from two different solar systems","this album sounds like half 'absolution' b-side leftovers and half new dancemuse songs. that is my honest opinion. my guess is they are striking the iron while it is hot and wanted to get something (anything) out as fast as they could. so they took the leftovers and the new ones and put em together. that said, there are some fine tracks here. but a half great album is not a great album. despite my 2* rating, i do recommend this album for the dancemuse songs. not my favorite direction, but they are great tracks."
2,It's ok,"I am a little disappointed in this CD. Besides the song ""Starlight"" I don't find any of the other songs even remotely appealing. Instead I found that all of them sound the same and that I got bored rather quickly.I think downloading ""Starlight"" for $0.99 would have been a better idea and bargain."
2,"""Starlight"" is a must listen!","I'm not wild about this album but for anyone interested in alternative or ""indie"" music, ""Starlight"" is a must listen, classic.Matt ZarnstorffZarnstorff"
3,Sounds Familiar,"Sorry, but does anyone realize Knights of C sounds a lot like Blondie's ""Call Me""? It's a good song, it's just been done before. Listen next time, you will never think of it the same way, trust me."
3,"Hmmmm, maybe it will grow on me...","Maybe, maybe not. So far not too impressed with the CD, and the DVD won't play in my computer. Lame...I am changing this review. After more listens, this CD is in fact great, almost as good as Absolution and in places better. I would change this review to 4 stars but can't."
3,They have a futuristic sound,It had one song I heard on the radio that I liked. Be weary buying this though because you may not get it. It is very new aged sounding. I thought it was ok but maybe it is one that the more you listen to it the more you like it.
4,Black Holes And Revelations w/ DVD,"Very good fare in general. Some songs weren't quite up to the level of the others (Assasin, Supermassive Black Hole, Knights of Cydonia, and possibly the intruiging Map Of The Problematique are my favorites), but, overall, it's probably. I got this to make myself eligible for Super Saver Shipping :), and the concert videos...well, they're concert videos. Not much going for them there, but if you're a fan, I guess it's worth the five bucks. I'd say it was worth it for me to buy it on Amazon rather than picking out individual tracks on iTunes, but if you're not that heavily into their stuff, you should probably just get the aforementioned tracks for 3.96, and not wait a week to get it."
4,Different!,"Very different from the other albums. OOS still remains my favourite 'cause its got so much substance in its music and lyrics. This one has good lyrics - the music on some tracks is too slow for me though. Love ""city of delusions"", ""knights of cedonia"", ""take a bow"", and ""map of the problematique""."
3,people wet themselves over this stuff...,"..and i can understand why. it's good, it really is, especially starlight, supermassive blackhole, and the absolutely lovely soldier's poem. but this music is ultimately rehashed, with maybe a few new elements thrown in (namely that synthy eighties pop sensibility that's been so popular as of late). it's the same uninspired hit or miss chord progressions/vocal patterns, though they are getting better at it. in all fairness i'd give this 3 1/2 stars, but i'm rounding down because so many people are already giving this incredibly undeserved 5 star ratings."
2,Meh,"Nearly every song on this album sounds the same. Sure The band has a lot of energy, but that can only take you so far. They lack truley original ideas, and enough variation in their songs to make this album last more than a week. Even the lyrics are kinda weak. The songs are far too predictable, maybe I'm just spoiled by Radiohead as i'm sure If I had never heard Radiohead I would think Muse was great."
2,"Great music, terrible singer","I wish I had listened closer to the samples before buying this record. I thought the song from Guitar Hero III was cool, so I bought the record. The music is so awesome, it's a tragedy that the singer is so annoying. He really needs to listen to something other than Radiohead, and develop his own voice. After a couple songs, the impersonation becomes pastiche. Maybe the band will find a new singer(with better lyrics) and the next album will really be great."
2,they're losing it!,"...and it makes me so sad. i'm a huge fan of ""showbiz"" and was even more blown away by ""origin of symmetry."" but they started to push it with ""absolution,"" and after this one, i'm afraid they're finished. i'm getting very tired of the uninspired and repetitive piano arpeggios, and while the guitars are decent and high energy, they ultimately lack the creativity and distinction that muse achieved in the previous albums. the lyrics are trite, and the vocals are more whiney than ever. it's just a very dull, unimportant album.i expected more from muse."
4,Muse continues to impress,"(4 & 1/2 stars) I first got interested in Muse because of their prog-rock leanings, but I've stayed with them as a band with a bunch of exciting musical ideas, as demonstrated in abundance on Black Holes. The diversity of songs on this CD is impressive, from quietly acoustic to all-out hard rock. I was amazed that there's even a tune with a bit of the Prince-ish 80's funk sound (""Starlight""). Then there's the adventurous Radiohead-esque electronic rock of ""Take A Bow"" and ""Map of the Problematique."" The musical is all pretty great, but add in the sci-fi themes of the CD (I'm a SF buff too) and the album package by an excellent design team that includes the legendary and amazing Storm Thorgerson, and the Black Holes CD is just about unbeatable - almost 5 stars, not quite."
4,"three and one half stars, really...","The good news is that Muse appears to be emerging from Radiohead's shadow. Conversely, they appear to be going in many directions at once. This lack of direction provides a sometimes thrilling, sometimes bumpy ride. Take a Bow is the perfect introduction to the new Muse. Just at the point when your about to say ""what the f..."", the guitars kick in and the cd starts to take shape. The first three songs mix synths, guitars and genres and you realize this isn't your older brother's Muse (or Radiohead for that matter). The fourth track, Map of the Problematique, combines Depeche Mode and U2 while somehow not sucking. But wait, theres more oddities to come: Queen like harmonizing; flamenco music; a Herb Albert horn... and it works. By the time you get to the final track, Knights of Cydonia, you realize singer/guitarist Matthew Bellamy has lost his freaking mind. But damn if I didn't hit repeat and take the ride again..."
3,par for the MUSE course,"as usual with a MUSE cd, we get some amazing songs and some pretty forgetable songs. as for ""knights of cydonia"",lets just say, believe the hype. its a song not of this world. and it sounds just as great live."
3,Good stuff.,"This has some of my favorite hits from Muse. I gave it three stars because some of the other songs are kind of annoying. But that's my taste, everyone is different."
4,Muse Backs Off From Perfection of Origin Of Symmetry,"Muse's new album was good, but a large disappointment (because their albums are usually great.) The songs are far less epic and some are encroaching on the style of more girly American bands like Death Cab for Cutie (and track 4 sounds like Depeche Mode composed it.) I would guess that this change of style is an attempt to get Muse on the radio more, but I haven't heard that from anyone (purely my opinion.)One of my chief concerns is they are getting too electronic! You can still get the favored Stockholm Syndrome-like sound from Knights of Cydonia and arguably some other tracks, but the rest of the songs aren't as hard I would prefer them. Piano also isn't as prominent compared to their previous albums.It's a good album, but it can't hold a candle to Origin of Symmetry and is beaten by Absolution as well."
4,"ADULTS, GROW UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This is an excellent book/autobiography. I very much enjoyed it. Being a young adult and reading some of the adults reviews makes me laugh. Are you kidding? You read a book like Please Stop Laughing At Me..., and it sparks a depressing mood in the reader. Then you see how Jodee overcomes her troubles later on in life. Then people have the nerve to write ""It's the own girls fault that the people didnt like her...blah blah..."" You're supposed to set examples for kids, even the ones that ARE made fun of. You make ignorant adults and malicious kids parallel. I guess you don't get any better as you get older. And to past reviewers that have this attidude, you must have a terrible life if all you have to do is sit and write reviews making fun of someone whose traumatized from being made-fun of. Trying to convince yourself it's her fault she was ridiculed just makes it seem okay for kids to believe they're right in bullying fellow students. Nice Job."
2,Please stop laughing at me.,"Please Stop Laughing at Me-Jodee BlancoAs a person who was bullied in elementary school, I thought this book would somehow speak to/relate to me in some way. I expected a book that would tell of one woman's journey through all the bullying trials. After all, the title and subtitle seems to hint at that, but I was pretty disappointed that it lacked that element.I also expected this book to address bullying in schools as it's a pretty serious matter, but it did not. I also expected Blanco to give some sort of insight or wisdom on how to cope with bullying, but she did not. I don't think many young people who are experiencing bullying will be able to connect with this book. What I wish would have been included was ways to overcome and grow from the experiences.I received this book for free from Booksneeze.com."
1,Disappointed,I wish I would have read some of the reviews of this book before I bought it as a deal of the day for Kindle. As a Girl Scout Leader and mother bullying is a topic that I think is so important. I did hope that the book would be inspirational in that Jodee would learn how to overcome bullying and there would be insight and lessons I could pass on.I didn't find it to be inspirational at all. After I started reading it I actually had to look back at the description of the book because I thought that it must be fiction. More than a description of a girl being bullied I think this is a book written by a woman with borderline personality disorder.I wouldn't recommend this book.
1,Terrible Book,"I waited over a year to write this review bc I wanted to ruminate on it a bit. The biggest problem with this book is that she admits that she refused to find a clique other than the ""popular"" crowd. She ratted on them and then refused to stop hanging around them and going to their parties.The end of the book is all about how she went to her reunion and they all accepted her and liked her and invited her to socialize after the reunion. Not the kind of message I was looking for."
1,"Million Little Pieces, Anyone?","No truth. No answers. Not good writing. Even if you ignore the fact that she often exaggerates (or outright lies), she really does this important topic a disservice by oversimplifying and making unwarranted connections."
4,The most bestest review everr!!,"Please Stop Laughing At Me by Jodee Blanco is an overwhelming story of a girl who faces a horrible childhood. This easy to read non-fiction book is actually Jodee's own childhood. She is faced with school bullying while attending her school, and to make matters even worse, her own friends do it to. Please Stop Laughing At Me is unfortunate, and makes you wonder why people in this world would do such a thing.It makes you never want to put the book down. If you don't find this book interesting, emotional, and memorable then I'm sure nothing will. I give this book two thumbs up! Jodee Blanco does an extraordinary job on letting kids know how school bullying is very cruel and how it can damage a life forever."
5,She aired it all out.,"I thought this book was incredible. I would never have the nerve to put my feelings out there like that. She didn't cover up anything most of us try to hide. It took me back to when I was in jr high and high school. I had so many thoughts similiar to hers that I would never have the nerve to say out loud. People say its unrealistic but in my opinion it is very real.Bullying like what she experienced isn't rare, but her willingness to share embarrassing thoughts is. I don't think she tried to build herself up. Instead she laid it all out there!"
2,Can't be compared to Dave Pelzer,"This is an engaging book--the story of the author's struggles at school are hard to put down. However, I found it quite frustrating as it lacked insight into what to do about bullying (Get reconstructive surgery? An excellent idea in this case, but not always a possibility or solution... Get the word out that you are writing a book about your past so everyone you knew will want to be nice to you before it gets published? May work...) The book does deal with a valid problem, but I found it rather self-serving."
5,What is everyone talking about?? This book is amazing.,"I first read this book when a teacher recommended it to me about 4 months ago, and I always think about it. I'd love to hear Ms. Blanco speak at my school about bullying, but nothing ever gets through to the kids. And to suggest that this book needs to be more ""enlightening"" is terrible; this is a true story! This is what she went through! Do you want her to lie just to make the book a certain way? It is my personal belief that this is book is perfect the way it is."
3,This just bummed me out,"This book bummed me out BIG TIME. I'm glad I read it, but I really don't know why I did. Oh, I know: it was in Target.I wouldn't recommend it too highly, but perhaps I have a different perspective on this subject.Give it a shot if you have kids or if you experienced this yourself, but hold off if you're searching for a new subject."
1,Conform or be cast out?,"Boy, someone should write a song with those words in it.I don't doubt that Jodee was tormented throughout her education. I wish she had used that experience to create a book that provided better advice to young readers or an honest and circumspect recollection of the events.Instead, her work comes across as artificial (particularly in the dialogue) and self righteous. Because of the over-arcing prose style, this is a hard book to take very seriously. I certainly wouldn't recommend it.I would, however, recommend an editor who knows the difference between a region in France and the location of a Big 10 University."
5,A litttle far fethced but a good read.,I think Ms. Blancco took some dramatic license with her book but it was very moving and I am happy she overcame her hardships.
