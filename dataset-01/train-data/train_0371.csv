5,An excellent book,"What makes Elmer Kelton stand out is not only his style of writing, and his subject matter (the value of which, I admit, is subjective), but the admirable qualities of his characters. In so many other books, main characters are filled with angst, and a reader may wish they would all take gas. Kelton's, though, a reader cheers on and wishes success. I've read and re-read this one. Great."
2,Fax modem with no Caller ID,I bought this modem looking for something I could use with caller ID. When I got the modem caller ID didn't work. The documentation said it should. I called tech support at Best Data and they said they didn't know! Seems they use a variety of chipsets on this modem. Bush league.
2,Not the best...,"Well,I truly have to say it was a sad movie,but to untrue.When the real mother told their kids she was going to die,Liam Aiken(who played her son),just stated: ""Could you tell Dad to tie my shoes the way you do?"" That is so stupid...what 6 year old would say that?It was an OK movie though."
5,a emotional movie,i can see 2 moms have to get alone for the family and child. it's impossible sprits after a break marriage.
3,E M O T I O N A L Faces!,"Before I start describing how good the movie was, I want to stop at both actors Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. If they are put in a silent movie, of no words and not even subtitles, they can make the film emotionally rich just by their facial expressions! I mean, you easily fall in love with those two actors because of their emotional faces and eyes.The is a light movie, that all family can enjoy watching together. It's based on emotional conflict between a family with two kids and a stepmom (Julia Roberts). In this movie you'll enjoy the emotional driven laughs and tears all the way until the end.One of the things that you'll enjoy most in this film is that you'll enjoy your life better and appreciate more many things in your life that you have taken for granted.THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR ALL FANS of Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. And if you loved this movie you'll love more Julia Roberts' movie ""My Best Friend Wedding""."
4,great family movie,"i thouhgt the movie was real touching and the plot was based on reality itself and what goes on in the real world...i thought the movie was very kute...anna didnt like isabel at first but once u get to know someone, u grow onto them and you guys become friends...a word of advice:dont ever judge a book by it's cover! stay straight. im out! =)"
4,Most uplifting yet heartwrenchingmovie since Steel Magnolias,"I thought Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon were a wonderful team that worked toghether like two peas in a pod. This was as good as ""Steel Magnolias"", laughing one minute then crying the next. Both women did such an excellant job!!"
5,This is an incredible film!,"If you are not touched after watching this film, than you are not human. This is a wonderful human story that is sure to bring tears to your eyes. Susan Sarandon is a marval. She interacted with Julia Roberts so well. The children are also gems. If your in the mood for a sentimental, tear-jerker, than this movie is for you. I recommend it highly."
3,a movie for the heart,it was an awesome movie with susan sarandon and julia roberts finding an unlikely friendship with each other. making susan die in the movie adds a lot of emotions. i didn't care for the snotty little daughter. watch the movie when your feeling down or just have a lot of time.
3,"Very touching, moving, and hilarious film","STEPMOM, to me, is a very touching, moving, and hilarious movie. I didn't laugh out loud, though. I laughed on the inside. The one person I really couldn't stand at times was Anna (Jena Malone). This was because of her attitude and the way she treated Isabel (Julia Roberts) most of the time. One of my favorite quotes of this movie is, ""Anna! You DO NOT run out on your mother!"" I was moved when Jackie (Susan Sarandon) said, ""Oh, sweetie, it's okay to miss me."" I thought everyone in the movie gave a very moving performance. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone who's a fan of Julia Roberts."
5,Step Mom,"Step Mom is a very excelent movie. It is funny, sad and all the mixed amotions you can go through.i think it is a wonderful story that is a heart warmer. i highly recomend this movie for people who enjoy sad movies, but this sad movie also has its homorouse parts that are a great add in this movie."
4,Enjoyable with good acting and a good story,"I liked this film from start to finish and it has top notch performances. The story is about a terminally-ill mother has to settle on the new woman in her ex-husband's life, who will be their new stepmother. The mother dosent like the way the new women acts and the why she worksa nd has kids. The acting is good from Susan Serandon, Julia Roberta give's a great performance also. Sadely this is a film that is forgotten fast and is underated. Overall it's touching,moving and funny it should entertain the whole family."
2,"SOPPY, SAPPY TEARJERKER","Way, way, way too overemotional and contrived. Ed Harris wants to marry his girlfriend, Julia Roberts. But his kids from his previous marriage to Susan Sarandon don't like her, and Susan Sarandon hates her. So naturally she has to win them all over... and of course tragedy has to happen, so Susan is stricken with cancer and will be out of the picture soon enough. Yes, there are some winning moments here. It would be difficult to have a film with all these well known and often brilliant actors without having some really great moments. But overall this is not a thrilling or interesting film."
1,boring,I didnot like this movie. I thought it would be good because Julia Roberts were in it. (WRONG). It was just as boring as it could be. Watch Pretty Woman for a outstanding Julia Roberts performance.
2,"Please, end my suffering...","This is a terrible movie. Not only is the acting quite pathetic, but the entire plot is dull and predictable. This kind of movie has been done a thousaund times, and there are far better versions out there. I felt sorry for those poor kids that had to play in this movie, so I gave it 2 stars."
1,What a waste of time and money !,"This is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. Not that the plot is that boring or the music not entertaining. But it is indicative of Hollywood's limits - having Roberts, Sarandon and Harris (thank God he's in here) together is by no means a guarantee for a good movie. Everything sounds fake, the acting is really poor, especially Julia Roberts' - but this isn't new (see the last scene, for example). Let's forget this movie, there are thousands of others waiting to be seen."
5,"A Movie for both stepmoms, biological moms and fathers!","While watching this movie I felt that many of the scenarios were unrealistic, however I was pleased to see the movie bringing some very real issues to the forefront. I watched this movie with my husband and he was truly enlightened by some of the scenes. I think the movie demonstrated that stepfamily/remarriage issues are prevalent within all walks of life, just because a family may be financially better off than some, does not mean that they are free from stefamily/remarriage issues. The movie was definitely effective in making society aware of stepfamily/remarriage issues. I feel that the movie did a great job in an honest portrayal of stepmothers. The movie presented the stepmom as a human being, not as evil and complete with warts!"
5,A REAL TEAR-JERKER,"A GREAT MOVIE!!! The characers are wonderfully played, by Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ted Harris, and the whole package is very realistic. The story is in parts joyful, in parts sad, and in others harrowing. Mothers will sympathise with Susan Sarandon, whilst Step Mothers will sympathise with Julia Roberts. Divorced men will appreciate Ted Harris. For those fortunate enough to have not experienced anything like this, Stepmom teaches us a valuable lesson."
5,THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!,"This was the best movie I ever saw. Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, and Ed Harris are really good in this movie. It was so sad I cried! A must see for everyone."
4,Warm Loving Story,"The best part of this movie is how authentic the situations are. I grew up with step parents and know what its like to treat the ""step parent"" horribly because, lets face it you could in your mind because they weren't your biological sibling. Julia Roberts shows true courage though and sticks it out until finally the biological mother see's first hand that her kids are in good hands even when she cant be around. Highly recommend this to anyone in a similar situation."
3,LOVE the house!,I watch this movie because I love Ed Harris and his eyes:) and the Victorian House in the woods!! These two things are worth watching the movie for.
5,Stepmom,"Julia Roberts with a all star cast, this is a wonderful story of family trying to over come many problems off everyday life and then trying to come together as one family must buy."
5,Fast Shipping,This is a wonderful movie. I have seen it several times and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to have my own copy. DVD was in excellent condition.
5,tear jerkers,i have always loved this movie and now i own a copy. the cast works so well together.my term tear jerker is for movies that are happy and sad i'm sure people out there will understand this.
3,"Nice DVD - OK story, nice performances","I truly like Susan Sarandon, Ed Harris and Julia Roberts. I even like them in this movie. I just think that Susan Sarandon's character was a little heavy handed and Julia Roberts' character appeared to be a little bit thoughtless for an intelligent woman.The picture quality is very good and the audio is very clean and gives nice ambience to the film.This is definitely a two-hanky story and several scenes were hard for me to watch, with my two kids in mind, but overall this was a nice movie for a Sunday afternoon."
5,a very touching movie,"i saw this movie with my friend and her family. i was so touched by what i've seen but i was very ashamed to cry. but then the tears just keep rolling down my cheeks and i can't help it. i have been a follower of julia roberts and susan sarandon for as far as i can remember. i guess seeing them on screen together made a big difference. very seldom do i see films with two of my favorite actresses in it at the same time. i really love this movie. if i could, i'd watch it all over again on the big screen. for me, that is the only way to really enjoy the movie---it makes you feel like you are part of the movie or something. i don't know, that's just how i feel. whenever i watch a movie i really, really like...i imagine that i am a part of it but i'm only a spectator. i guess my imagination takes me farther than i expect."
5,One of the best I've seen,I thought that this movie was so good. The acting was great and I loved all the characters. My boyfriend cried with me-however not as long and as hard as me. I will own this one. Best movie since titanic
1,Wholesale and manipulative,"It's pretty bad when the most likeable character in your movie is a life-threatening disease. The two leads are so caught up in winning the affection of the children, they don't stop to wonder what's best for them. And while I normally like Ed Harris, his character basically boiled down to a likeable slimeball. And please, oh please, let there be a moratorium on Lip-Synching to Oldies as a method of plot expansion. If you're looking for quality, don't waste your time here."
1,You've got to be joking - only Hollywood could sell this,"Predictible, sob-story melodrama with a girlfriend agenda to boot! I'm surprised that Sarandon went anywhere near this, it's such a boring Hollywood take on the mom vs. younger girlfriend scenerio. Should be understood that this screenplay was originally written by real-life stepmom Gigi Levangie. I think Gigi had an agenda to push. For once I'd like to see Hollywood come out with a film that sings the praises of original moms, not younger-model girlfriends, and makes these original moms the attractive, healthy, mentally-sound very cool and sexy women they often are in real life. Let's give them the happy ending--they make the world go round! If you like soap opera drama-rama or you're a younger stepmom/girlfriend who wants justification and wants to demean the original mom/wife (I'm not an original mom or first wife, BTW, just an annoyed viewer), you'll think this is a great film. Otherwise, this is one to skip."
1,DVD doesn't work!,I give a zero rating - the DVD I purchased said it can't be used in this country!?!?! What a waste of money and time waiting for it!!!! Ridiculous!
2,Good talent wasted!!!!,"Three very talented actors were wasted in the sappy movie. Susan Sarandon is dying of cancer, but you hate her character for her attitude. Harris is weak, Roberts is cowardly. And the children are brats."
4,"Dull at the start, but the end is a classic tearjerker.","The first 45 minutes of STEPMOM were draining and dull. It was like a Jerry Springer catfight without all the sex and only some of the foul language. What blossoms in the next 80 minutes is a classic tearjerker that spreads great acting from all the actors and actresses, especially from Liam Aiken as Ben, the cute, love-to-love character. His acting charisma is almost perfect, the best of the excellent crop of acting. It's hard to know who to root for in the first half, it's boring and flat. But then everyone gets along and the movie becomes enormously refreshing and fantastic. I recommend this film to everyone. Loved it so much!!"
1,I missed something... maybe?,This movie is a UK version and does not play here in the us. Sending it to a friend overseas since this movie was a waste of money for me. Not sure If I missed this detail in the site or not. But I am disappointed.
2,very bad,I still have not received my movie and it has been close to 6 weeks....never using this one again...and there was no tracking offered so I cannot even know where it is....very disappointed
2,AN OKAY MOVIE BUT IRRITATING MOVIE,"I THOUGHT THE ACTING WAS SUPURB IN THIS MOVIE. I DID NOT CARE FOR THE PISSNG CONTEST BETWEEN THE EX-WIFE AND THE NEW LOVE INTEREST. I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT ADULTS WOULD ALLOW CHILDREN TO ACT THE WAY THESE DID AND LET IT CONTINUE. NOT ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR UNDER ANY CONDITIONS. (TAKE NOTE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN COLORADO IN THE PAST WEEK.) KIDS CAN BE ALLOWED TO GO TOO FAR. I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS OKAY BUT NOTHING GREAT. I THINK ALL OF THE BEST PARTS OF THE MOVIE WERE SHOWN IN THE TRAILER FOR THE MOVIE. I SAW THE MOVIE IN THE THEATER AND THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE WAS WHEN SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE SAID (NOT KNOWING HOW LOUD HE WAS SAYING IT) ""I WISH SHE WOULD HURRY UP AND DIE""."
4,One of the saddest movies I have ever seen.,"Stepmom may not be a definate classic but It will be remembered as a sad sad movie. It is one of the most heartbreaking films I have ever seen. Susan Sarandon gave what should've been an Academy Award nominated performance as a single mom battling cancer. Julia Roberts has another good performance as well as Ed Harris. The film does move you and make you feel lucky. It isn't my favorite, but for anyone who loved Terms of Endearment and Steel Magnolias this is the movie for you."
4,brilleint,This movie is wonderfull. It is sad it is funny but most of all it is touching. I love evrey min... Of this film. This is a must see.
3,Stepmom,"Stepmom was a good drama film. I have seen this movie several times and it is still a tearjerker to me. It is a movie that has you laughing at some parts, but crying throughout most of it. The plot in this movie was continuous, there were not many dull moments. I find myself getting bored very quickly through movies, but I did not get bored in this movie, and I still don't after seeing in multiple times. The actors and actresses did a well job playing the roles of their characters. The children played their roles exceptionally well. Overall, Stepmom was a excellent drama that is a movie you should watch if you are in the mood for some laughs as well as some tears."
4,"A cute, but sad movie","I saw this movie one weekend recently, and at first, I thought it was a bit boring. Then, I just relaxed and I was amazed by the acting chemistry between all of the characters. The story was a bit typical for any movie like this. The kids did a really good job. They acted as though they've been in the business since before they were born. Definitely a great movie, but make sure you have plenty of tissues, because you will cry!"
5,THE BEST MOVIE EVER!,"I recently bought this fablous movie. Even though I have now watched it five times, every time I start crying! It's a very touching movie that really makes you stop and think about life, and how wonderful it is! Susan Sarandon really seems like the charater she portrays (Jackie Harrison the mother of 2 children). She is diagnosed with cancer just as her ex-husband gets engaged. She fears that the children's new stepmom will take her place after she passes away, yet the stepmom (Julia Roberts as Isabelle) is afraid that she will never be able to make the kids accept her. The two of them become friends at the end. The song ""Ain't no mountain high enough"" really portrays the meaning and moral of the whole picture. This fantastic movie will make you laugh and cry at the same time! Take my advice and see it! I wish I could rate it higher than 5 stars because it deserves at least 10!"
2,It is an Old Tape,"The video tape was as advertized; however, the lighting was really quiet dark. Whether it was because of the age of the print (it was apparently in its original container) or this was a bad print I don't know; the poor quality took a lot of the enjoyment out of showing this to my grandchildren."
4,Awesome CD!,"I like these cds put out by Project because they keep many of the artists that I like on each release, but they also bring in new artists for you to get to know. Stained by Android Lust and Witches' Rune by Unto Ashes are my favorites along with Pray by Lycia, Attrition's Two Gods are Better than One, and Divine by Mira. These songs alone make it worth it to buy, in my opinion. They are sad or heavy in lyrics and sound while the rest of the cd's songs are relatively lighter in sound, even if some of the lyrics are deep and dark. Voltaire's Brains is funny and for some reason reminds me of the Monster Mash song even though it doesn't really sound like it. In Vain by Bleak is an instrumental song that is good to listen to when going about your day, but to me, Stir About the Stars is a better one. It stays instrumental for a good chunk of the song, but then has beautiful singing at the end."
3,Loved it....and then ehhhh,"I loved the first few chapters of this book. I was caught up in the story which was very erotic, but by the fourth or fifth chapter things started to get a little blah and then rather ridiculous. Even though this is a fictional story about a vampire, I still prefer a story that still is somewhat believable. Certain parts had me thinking, ""oh brother, how ridiculous"" I skipped over a couple of pages, because I was just really disappointed. With that being said. I have re-read this book many times and it is one of the books that I keep available."
5,Lucy at her best!,Once again Lucy shows her expertise in comedy. The way she portrays herself as a student trying to get a diploma cracks us up. I think she was great .
4,Seeing Lucy is always the best part!,"This was not one of my favorite ""Lucy movies"". Just to watch her perform is always great if you are a fan, no matter what the movie. In this movie, Lucy was young, but her comic ability comes shinning through as always. What an amazing actress!"
3,The book is better,"This Robert Louis Stevenson adventure (hereis the novel) concerns a sturdy 18th century youth who is betrayed by his uncle, kidnapped by a sea captain and rescued by a mercenary. This Disney take on the story is colorful, stylish and, frankly, dull. The villians are toothless. Disney's 1950Treasure Islandis better."
5,Looked for these rare b-sides for years!,I am so pleased with my order. It shipped fast and is in excellent conition.
3,Needed something more,"I bought this movie at the same time I bought Crossworlds. I enjoyed Crossworlds way more. This movie - Velocity Trap, seemed like some of the scenes could have been extended to tell the story better. If the movie was just a little longer....maybe it could have been better."
2,Herbie Rides Again is no good.............,"This sequel to The Love Bug, lacks a good plot, and an interesting cast. Set five years after the original, this film finds Herbie now sold to an annoying old lady living in a fire house. The fire house is the only building left in the way of Alonzo Hawk's new sky scraper being built. Robert Stevenson enters the plot as Hawk's nephew and goes against his uncle to help save the fire house. This film has nothing to do with the original and loses the formula. I would pass on this movie. However, Dean Jones and Don Knots returned in Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo to give the series back it's good name........."
2,Take My Advice PLEASE (See for ALL the Herbie Sequels),"Disney is NOT adding any features whatsoever for the Herbie, the Love Bug sequels. As a dedicated fan of the star car, I have discovered that so far ONLY Herbie Rides Again will be in Widescreen. The only other thing that could possibly be of any good quality within these discs would be a remastering of the picture and sound. Unless you've given up using your VCR or you are a collector, don't waste your time purchasing the Herbie sequels. Only the original movie, The Love Bug is worthy of it's ""Special Edition"" title."
5,Herbie Rides on Top,"Yes I am doing reviews on these Movies backwards so my last review will be on the Love Bug. The movie is really nice me thinks. Herbie falls in the good care of a Relative of Tennessee. She takes such good care of her Car , like I do to my Cats :)An interesting thing here is the mean Man in this movie happens to be related to a good Man who falls in love with the daughter of the Old Woman who now owns the Car. There is only one very mild race in this film and not a bunch of races like in The Love Bug and Herbie goes to Monte Carlo.This is a classic movie and Herbie is so awesome. Herbie does interesting things like Rides on tall Buildings and gets chased by bad people who where sent by the Villain to run that Old Lady out of her house."
2,Not good for little kids,"My two year old loves Herbie, so we rented this to give us all a break. Now we are paying for it! The villian in this movie rants, raves, screams, and bosses everyone around conitinuously. Perhaps it is coincidence, but our mild-mannered son has become a mini-version of this tryant. After two weeks, he is finally returning to normal. I would not recommend showing this movie to suggestible children. It is difficult to find live-action, non-violent movies with good role-model characters. Stick with ""The Love Bug."""
1,Plastic Pant Hangers,"Do not waste your money on these hangers. The plastic part will break or come out of the hanger after a short period of time. Why do manufactures continue to make such cheap products in China and expect us to replace them over and over again ? Just make products like they made them 30-40 years ago. Throw out the cheap plastic parts, make them out of steel and charge 15- 20 cents more for the product."
1,broke and hit my eye!,"Had lots of these, same brand name, and after a couple of years one of the black soft plastic parts that holds the hook and engages with the clamp broke and popped me right in the eye.I was lucky that I didn't wind up in the ER or worse.OUT THEY ALL GO!!!!!!!"
3,"Lyrical writing style, some useful advice","The author writes in a highly personal, lyrical, and IMOsomewhat self-indulgent style. It's not my cup of tea, butif there is a large audience for this form of writing, morepower to the author. I personally think that the most usefulmessage to come out of this book is ""trust your instincts"".The primary inspiration is Beth's courage, amidstthe shock of dealing initially with the PDD-NOS conunudrum,to tune out the noise, and chart Jeremy's courseherself based on her own instincts of what felt rightand what seemed to worked best for him. Having been ina similar albeit less traumatic situation, I can'tconvey how much courage it takes to jettison, or atleast cherry-pick among the advice of the experts. Theinstinct to let the experts take over is very powerfulwhen you are searching for answers, and want to protectyour child from something unknown and frightening. Butwhen it comes to autism spectrum disorders, parentalinstinct can often trump psychology."
5,The book transcends its own sentimentality,"Anyone who's dealt with the priesthood of child-development experts and suspected that their approach is impressionistic at best will know that there's more to this book than the apparent bittersweet sentimentality. Such bathetic sentimentality lacquers the book in the many scenes in which a lonely Jeremy tries to navigate a strange world: but it's only lacquer, and beneath it is a hard, penetrating probing of the relationship of the parent to the child, and the spirit to a sometimes-pharasaical consensus called ""normal."" Parents with PDD children like Jeremy will nod on every page: parents with ""normal"" children should be challenged to reassess their own assumptions about fitting children to the world."
4,Amazing heart,"Beth Kephart writes with so much love and grace. Her observations of her son, his intelligence, beauty, and struggles, is so wonderfully clear.I recommend this book for anyone who loves a child, who has felt different, who is intrigued by the puzzles of humans."
5,a poetic account of a generous mother,"A Slant of Sun, which was nominated for a National Book Award, is one of the most sincere books I have ever read. It is not written like a ""book,"" I found it to read fluidly like an epic poem. Beth Kephart's use of metaphors and images are what kept me intrigued. It was my honor to read this book and I reccommend it to anyone who knows what is is like to struggle or anyone who loves hearing about hope. Thank you Beth Kephart for letting us inside your family to see the miracle you call Jeremy."
5,this is the first book I want to recommend to parents.,"As a speech and language pathologist for over 20 years, I have helped scores of parents overcome labels and devasting predictions made by well intentioned specialists. This book speaks truth. It is so helpful because it comes from a mother's bond and love and doesn't prescribe. Parents need to trust their instincts and follow what makes sense to them. They need reassurance that the symptoms that a child presents with are not the disease, but a sign of where to begin. I admired this book because it didn't present miracles or sudden cures. It spoke the truth, that the journey takes time and hard work and can end with tremendous hope."
5,Great book for young people t0 learn,"This book offers very specific advice on how to build shelters in snow of from snow. I found it very useful and accurate, but do not depend on this book alone for snow survival. Another good book for young people is the Opkik:Cold Weather Camping book. I think the 2 together make a great pair. The shelters do work and the designs are proven, but make sure you practice these in a controlled environment before you try to build on in an emergency."
2,Serious 'foodies' will probably be disappointed,"My review title is also the last line in my review ofBeyond the Great Wall: Recipes and Travels in the Other Chinaby the same authors and my comments about that book hold true here. While visually entertaining to browse through (nice pictures of Indian places and people), there is very little of substance for serious cooks. I'll stick to Madhur Jaffrey any day when it comes to Indian food."
2,Book of travels not recipes,"The pictures and stories of the travels through the region are fabulous, but if you are looking for good instrutctions and pictures of the recipes, this is not the cookbook you are looking for."
5,Finally tried some of the recipes - all turned out great!,"I've had this book for about three months, and have flipped through it many times, but this weekend I finally bought the staple ingredients that many of the recipes needed, and tried out three of them. They all turned out delicious! Don't be put off by strange ingredients, they were all very cheap, and easy to cook with."
5,Beautiful and authentic,"I cannot imagine anyone writing anything negative about this book...my family and I come from Bangladesh and India and I have tons of Pakistani friends. The depth that the authors have gone into understanding ingredients and the cooking is remarkable. I cannot imagine how they came to know some of those details. Like my neighbor in PA who had written a negative review, I have also Jaffrey's books which i love but Alford and Duguid got into the very essence of real home cooking of the subcontinent. Other authors sometimes focus on party foods while this book advises the readers on what people really eat on a daily basis. The other travel advice is interesting and the photographs gorgeous although i understand the concerns of the Bethlehem, PA reviewer of pictures that are hard to interpret. Just let it go. They still do an even better job with this book than Hot Sour Salty Sweet. The book is great. I'm glad amazon offers it for a lower price than bookstores."
1,in print in paperback,"This is a warning review about the rip-off sellers charging way too much for out of print stuff.(Not Amazon's fault as they have no control as to what these individuals charge.) If you don't mind paperback, this book is in print in that format. Buy that version. There are good sellers, don't support the bad ones!"
2,Beware if you are a Z3 owner!!!!,"I bought this manual to do maintenance on my 96 Z3. What a mistake. Even basic things like the photo for the oil filter and the brake rotors are incorrect. If you own a 3 series, I guess it is a fair book for the price. But if you are looking for a Z3 repair manual, keep looking."
3,Adequate for some work.,"Could offer more info in detail. Could be better, not a great detail book. Not enough detailed information. Adequate for some work."
3,Interesting but not for practical use,"I purchased this book as a practical guide and read to help navigate life as a caregivier and support system of a close friend. I found it a bit too ethereal and very heavily weighted toward the Tibetan Buddhist views on life and death. Although, interesting, it's hardly useful on a daily basis. It is an interesting book to read, but it's not for those who are looking for hands on answers."
5,A must read,"Sacred Passage takes a disarmingly honest look at the subject of death. It is filled with real life stories that demonstrate new and innovative ways to interact with a person who is dying.The author, a former emergency room and hospice nurse, gives sage advice and practical suggestions on how to deal with many of the troubling situations that come up when a friend or loved one is given a terminal diagnosis. The book offers the Buddhist perspective on death and dying in terms that are clear and easy to relate to.I rate this book 5+ and recommend it as both a provocative narrative as well as an extremely helpful little manual on how to be an empathetic presence during the death of a loved one."
3,Buddhist Spiritual-Principals Advisory,"This is a very useful book and a quick read for those inclined to the buddhist approach to dying. However, if the dying person is of another faith or faithless..it has limited applications for the dying person and will be mostly useful to the care-giver. Also, application in the dying person's life of these ideas is not a ""quick fix"", so if you are not the full-time care-giver, it is difficult to find a place to wedge such new ideas into the dying persons paradigm."
5,the best,"The best i had in a long time ,been using it on everything ,with crackers ,a toast cheese you name it."
3,SURRISINGLY EFFECTIVE!,"I went to my local video store expecting to rent some garbage, I picked this up and to my surprise it wasnt! its an action packed, well paced picture,with a good budget for something with the ""nu image"" company label. baldwin is good in the lead , i liked it kind of a lot...3 and a half stars. (out of five)"
4,Very enjoyable.,It is a very good action movie. I like Stephen Baldwin. I have watched this movie multiple times. I recommend this movie.
2,Dirty Harry wanna-be.,"A few shootouts here and there aren't what I call entertainment, but at least you won't be bored too long. The Usual Suspect's Chazz and Steven are wasted in this plotless peice of action, only die hard fans of action need apply."
4,Fun childhood memories...,"This was one of my favorite childhood movies, being both a musical (Who knew Sean Connery could sing?) and a comedy involving an old man's ongoing battle of wits and cunning with the Leprachaun king and the townfolk's reaction to this ""crazy old man"" and his goings on."
1,Darby O'Gill and the Little People,"I've always loved this movie, but the DVD that I received did not work. Apparently it was a foreign copy and does not work on U.S. DVD players or computers."
4,"Great story, acting, music, special effects!","This has to be Disney's greatest kept secret - a film which satisfies on many levels. There's a wonderful story with many plot twists and turns, great whimsical performances by veteran actors and a young Sean Connery, lovely Irish melodies and the main song, ""My Pretty Irish Girl"" (Mr. Connery sings it!), inspired humor and comedy, incredible special effects made in 1958 which surpass many made today ( you'll believe they hired real leprechauns), and some pretty scary parts ( intense for some ). Did I mention a great surprize plot twist at the end? It's one of my favorites that I watch again and again. Even old grumps will find some fun in this. Try it!"
4,Disney movie,The greatest thing about this movie is you see Sean Connery before he had his heavy signature voice. The movie is a little heavy for young kids. My 6 year-old couldn't keep his mind on it.
5,Little People is a Big Movie to this grown up kid,"This was the movie that made it make sense to believe in Santa Claus, even though he's not in it. The special effects hold up well today, and I can see that modern films such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy owe a great deal to Darbie O'Gill and the Little People. I've shared it with several friends and co-workers, some of whom admitted they were obsessed with it as children, some of whom were anxious to share it with grandchildren before they were too old to believe. A lovely story, beautifully realized. Will admit the special features were what took me over the edge as a child. Disney recruiting the little people to star in his movie -- don't watch them until after the film because they give too much away."
3,Darby....,"Cute classic from Disney. It is very entertaining for those of us raised on these movies. I doubt it would be interesting to teens of today though. It is good and clean. I can recommend it for the whole family.Darby is full of his stories of the little people. After he catches one, all stuff breaks loose. He just has to prove that he hasn't lost his mind and get the right husband for his daughter."
2,misunderstood,I misunderstood that the transaction was for a digital viewing of Darby O'Gill. I wish it was more clear how to purchase a regular DVD to be shown in a classroom. I love the movie and thought it would be a good culminating activity for children who were studying Irish culture.
1,Poor quality,"I was excite about receiving this film. It was a favorite of my children and was looking forward to sharing it with my grandson. Imagine my disappointment when the quality of the video was so poor, it was unwatchable."
1,DVD did not play,Bought this DVD as part of a Christmas gift. The DVD arrived on time and was sealed. Tried to play the DVD in 3 different DVD players and it would not play and gave an error message. I was very unsatisfied with this and when I emailed customer service I recieved a generic letter stating how I could return it. They did not send an apology and I am still waiting on my refund.
4,Sean Connery sings...........,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was young and thoroughly enjoyed it. Many years passed before I saw it again, but when I did, I enjoyed it just as much as when I was little. The plot is pretty simple but the banter is witty and the music is catchy. A young Sean Connery is handsome and smirky and it's a good time to hear him singing such a happy happy song. The special effects are great for their time and it's also wonderfully edited."
5,Awesome Movie,"I saw this when I was a kid and I still think today that it is one of thebest Irish movies of the day. Sean Connery was just making a startin the movies. The story is a little dark for small children to watch, butstill a good movie for people who love good Irish movie......."
5,Darby O'Gill and The Little People - Classic Review,"What a fabulous movie. The story, the characters, the music, the dancing, all make you truly believe in the little people. My kids, now 20 and 24 remember this movie and got a big kick out of seeing this classic again. I sent it to them as a St. Patrick's Day gift - great way to share a little Irish celebration! Disney did a fantastic job so long ago. Darby O'Gill is one of the best characterizations I've seen - so believable. What can I say, anyone who sees this movie will enjoy it! It's a classic."
5,Fun family film,"This is a movie I remember from my childhood and jumped when I saw it on dvd! It is a joy to watch, and has some very funny parts to it! It is amazing to note how convincing the Leprechauns are considering this movie was made decades before computers were available. The singing is good, if not great, but it is fun and the tunes stay with you."
5,A Short One,"Since I first saw ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" I have rewatched it over and over. Bought it on tape and wore it out and still watched it on TV when it came on.I think that if you compare it to the ""Magic"" the studios can achieve with computers,you'll be disappointed.For me the word to discribe it is endearing.Thanks and a pint of Guiness to ya!"
4,Darby O'Gill and the Little People,As good as I remember when I was young. The grandchildren also enjoyed it!
4,back to my childhood,First seen when Sean Conery and I were both a lot younger. A great fantasy of celtic culture and music - a movie all the family can watch.
3,mmmmmmmmmm Bruce Campbell,"Well, it has Bruce Campbell in it.....which is why it's in my collection. I tried to find it........after seeing the second one on latenight T.V. one night, and it got my interest up. I was looking forward to seeing the begining of the story, but couldn't find it anywhere....I actually found it at Blockbuster for 4.99 when the box had 79.95 printed on it, (must've been one HELL of a sale!!) Anyway, the story line is good, it's not too gory, but it was a little different. And of course it has Bruce Campbell in it which just makes me happy!! I thought the Evil Dead was the greates for the longest time. I would reccomend this one if not to buy, just to rent it.....just to check it out."
3,Maniac Cop,"I seen this movie ages ago and it had a real good plot and a lot of action to the movie, The cop(Robert Tzar) was set up sent to prison where he sent a lot of the criminals he arrested got attacked the Coroner found out while he was on the table he was still alive but unfortunately brain damaged from lack of oxygen was secretly taken out of prison under the assumption he was killed in the attack His Girlfriend had him hidden where he would attack and knock off innocent people. And the rest is a decent plot that sired 3 other Maniac Cop movies."
3,Finally,"I saw it. I can say I saw it. It was a fun, silly movie to watch in the days leading up to Haloween."
2,Beh..........,"If you are a fan of Bruce Campbell or the Raimi Bros., do everyone a favor and skip this cookie-cutter whodunnit..."
3,Me Cop 1,I recently watch Maniac Cop 2 and loved it. So I was anxious to see the original and 3rd ones.This movie didnt start off the way I thought it would. The story is basicly of a Cop named Matt Cordell who was a NYPD officier and did something that had him put into jail. However the myors department for somereason pull strings to have him put into a prison where he put half the guys away. He is murdered and scared up pretty badly. But is Matt dead?Maniac Cop starts terrorising the streets of NY city and the people of NY are terrified of the police all because of one phyco who is ticked off. And of coarse theres the plot of others around it to give it plot and story.No bonus features. I actualy still like the second one better! But these should be released as a trilogy instead of poor treatment on there own.
5,"You have the right to remain silent, FOREVER","I found Maniac Cop to be a great action/horror film. Director William Lustig continues his crusade to make good flicks(like Relentless,Uncle Sam,and the classic Maniac). This film is among his best. Robert Z'Dar(a truely underrated actor)plays the psycho cop who stalks the streets of NY. Tom Atkins(Halloween III)is on his trail. Maniac Cop's sequels were not on par with the original, but all three films are worth a look, especially the well done original."
3,I loves me some cheese!,"This is a classic cheesey slasher flick. Cool villian, cool death scenes, basically no plot. Everything you need for an entertaining, enjoyable 1980's cheesefest. Highly reccomended for fans of bad 80's low budget slashers. I love it!"
4,Maniac Cop is an Original,"If you are a big fan of action/horror then you should really check this movie out! It's got great acting, awesome action scenes and sometimes very subtle humorous actions by the ""Maniac Cop"" (Robert Z'dar). This movie is definitly a good one! The two sequels that follow are really good as well!"
3,THIS COP'S A MANIAC,"Evil Dead's Bruce Campbell is framed and arrested for a series of gruesome murders against innocent law abiding New York citizens. Witnesses claim the killer was a large white male wearing a NYPD uniform.Detective Tom Atkins (star of ""The Fog"" and ""Halloween III"" ) is not convinced that Campbell's the man. And he's not.Robert Z'dar(a very big man) plays the killer, a former NYPD officer sent to an Alcatraz-style jail for getting too carried away in dispensing tough justice. Attacked and left for dead in prison, he survives and is somehow smuggled out by the coroner(of all people) and now Z'dar is mad and want's revenge.Not bad, no terror or suspense though, just several nasty and quite hilarious murders.Shaft himself, Richard Roundtree co-stars."
3,At least Bruce Campbell's in it...,"And believe me, that's about all this movie has going for it. It's your typical low-budget freak/monster B-movie. There is little to nothing in the way of originality in this film and should be avoided by anyone who doesn't love B-movies. It lacks the humor and imagination of many other movies of this genre.Having said that, though, it does star Bruce Campbell (star of the Evil Dead trilogy) as the hero and just about any movie starring BC is worth watching at least once. There's nothing terribly exciting about his performance here, but... it's Bruce Campbell.It should also be said that this DVD comes with some excellent extras, considering that it's such a low-budget, relatively unknown, cult film. With many DVDs of this genre, you're lucky if you have any special features at all. Deleted scenes, trailers, commentary, etc. A very nice surprise."
3,Pure trash that's enjoyable to a point,"Maniac Cop has never had too warm a place in my heart as it has in many other's, but this flick from writer/producer Larry Cohen and director William Lustig (Maniac) serves as being enjoyable trash in it's own merits. Genre stalwart Tom Atkins stars as a veteran detective who thinks that a rash of murders are being perpetrated by a cop thought long dead, while the department thinks they've caught their man with a young patrolman (Bruce ""Evil Dead"" Campbell) that fits the profile. A majority of Maniac Cop is a predictable mess that doesn't strive to be anything more than what it is, and in that respect alone, you can't help but admire the cheesiness of it all. The sequels that followed failed to deliver the same kind of enjoyable trash moviemaking that the original did, and having Bruce Campbell here just makes this flick more enjoyable than it should be. Also featuring Richard ""Shaft"" Roundtree and Evil Dead and Spider-Man director Sam Raimi in a quick cameo."
5,This is the book I've been looking for!,"Do you love nature? Do you have an artisic urge? Do you think creating art is difficult or expensive? If you love nature and want to bring it to your fabrics, walls, note cards, etc. then this book would surely delight you! The Victorians loved ""capturing"" nature in all its innocence, beauty, and comfort. They created so many wonderful collections, decorations, etc. This wonderful addition to the craft world shows the nature lover how to use nature to enhance the tranquility of your home or surroundings. The author shows you how to use an endless bounty from the natural world plus a few printing inks and paints to illustrate your world with the panorama of nature. The techniques within this volume are so enchanting yet simple enough for children to to accomplish as well. A wonderful way to enoy summer days!"
1,A travesty,"It's difficult to write what I feel about this book. I read as much of it as I could stomach and then threw it into the trash in the hope no one would ever find it. This man, the author, is either terminally misled or has an ego the size of the universe. He knows how women feel? Excuse me? When was he a woman? I pity the poor woman who reads this and accepts it hook, line, and sinker. He is so off base as to be laughable, if I didn't worry that some women would actually take him seriously.Truly ecstatic lovemaking is a matter of giving and being given to in total love. It has nothing whatsoever to do with ""succumbing"", ""surrendering"", ""giving up"" -- on either part.I am especially deeply disappointed in Marianne Williamson for promoting this delusional writing.There was no way to get this posted but to choose at least one star for this rating. If I'd had a choice, I would have chosen the negative (-) sign for ""Don't bother, it's just another male ego trip."" Unbelievable."
2,Profound journey of self-absorption and avoidance.,"This story details a profound journey of self-absorption and avoidance of responsibility and the associated burdens in the face of tragedy. Although there is a positive resolution, the transition is not so detailed. It is as though it is simple exhaustion that transforms the character into an honorable person. This story is a close-up of the pathetic, like following a drunkard through the details of a hangover."
2,Literary Lacking,"Surprisingly unconvincing for a major Japanese novelists. Lacks the artistic imagery of Mishima or sensitivity of Soseki (or of Japanese writers in general). Maybe Oe's hailed for hopeful, redemptive themes, but that does not quite do it for me. I find this and Silent Cry unremarkable."
5,"Stephanie Plum, look out! You have competition here!","This series is hilarious. Stephanie Plum has her family to help keep the laughs coming. Grace Smith has only herself. She doesn't need anyone else. This series will keep you laughing. You'll love Grace, trust me."
5,"The Sweet ""Live In Denmark 1976""","O.K. First things first. The Sweet had all their true chart success in the first half of the 70's (save the '78 hit ""Love Is Like Oxygen"") and that can be very deceptive of the actual value of this band. The Sweet always struggled to be respected among their peers at the time and they tried hard to undo their teenybopper image with their live show that even early on was considarably heavier than their chart hits would imply. ""Live In Denmark"" finds The Sweet doing what they do best. They are provocative, sloppy, loud and relentless in their delivery. What came accross as nice and tidy on the hit singles gets buried under a wall of attitude and sheer balls. I highly recomment this CD to anyone who enjoys real hard rock with maximum power and drive. Many bands struggle on forever to have ONE night like these guys had 24 years ago in Denmark. A must have!Patrik Tanner"
3,Pretty good..,"I love Al Green. The title of this CD is The Absolute Best, and although I think its very good, I just wouldnt call it the ""Absolute Best"". They could've enhanced the sound quality because the music sounded a bit dated, low & muted. However, with that being said...if you like Al Green, you'll like this... I just dont think it was the Absolute Best. Maybe because of how the songs were arranged."
5,The Glory Days of Neil,"This album was recorded when Diamond was switching over from the bubblegum swingers of Bang days to a mature artist who wanted to be accepted for more meaningful songs. This album contains some soul-searching tracks from I Am..I Said to Stones which are his own compositions coupled with songs by Leonard Cohen's masterpiece Suzanne and Tom Paxtons 'Last Thing on My Mind'. This album contains indeed some awesome tracks from an young man with a voice that has beautiful seductive edge most unparalled during the 70/s. If you are looking for songs that can stir your soul, this is a must. And the cover shows Neil looking like a greek god with his long hair and poetic aura !"
4,One of Neil's best early efforts...,"These ten tracks are thoughtful and soulful and mostly mellow. All are well done, and the price asked is fair for a change, considering this is somewhat short given today's CD capabilities. You could put two early Diamond LP's on a CD and add five bucks and still have a bargain. If you like Neil, and don't own this one, grab it quick. If you want an introduction to the young Neil's serious side, this one's your baby."
2,very disappointing,"Some great songs, but I wanted the original Stones album and got a mixture of other albums. Be careful when you order cd's from Amazon....."
2,Neil's on a bummer,"Diamond was at low point, literally, when he put this album together. A songwriter who can't sing shouldn't do cover songs. Plus, Neil was already into grunting instead of singing by this time in his career, and too far gone into strings and syrupy orchestrations. The only entertainment on this album is ""Crunchy Granola Suite"", which is Neil's hilarious attempt at rock and roll. And this was 1971."
5,As high as it gets,"With only four songs, this single is one of the best discs in my collection. ""This Twilight Garden"" and ""Play"" are as sad and pretty as Cure can get and the ""High"" remix is absolutely gorgeous. A must buy for anyone who loves Cure and devine pop songs."
4,Where are the Bloopers?,"Lucy and Desi and their kids have intrigued me for many many years. This documentary was very well done, exceptfor the sound, which I thought could have been better. I would have loved to have seen a little more of Vivian Vance, since I thought she and Lucy were very close during and after the show. My main disappointment was in the bloopers! There is an Outakes section, but it is of Lucie and Desi, Jr making the documentary, not of the I Love Lucy Show, which is what I thought the bloopers would be from, since that is what the description leads you to believe."
5,GREAT',"Just watched ""Lucy and Desi, A Home Movie"" on DVD. Love it! Narrated by Lucie.and Desi Jr., it gave the TRUE story of their lives. (Differed greatly from the made-for-t.v.movie). It contains Lucy and Desi Arnaz's home movies of their first home together and their genuine affection and respect for each other even after the divorce. Also has interviews with people who grew up with them. EVERY ""I Love Lucy"" fan should see this. It humanizes these people. No longer just characters on t.v. You see them as the people they actually were. Excellent!"
4,I Love Lucy and Desi,"I am a real fan of Lucy and Desi from the 50's, so this DVD is really interesting to see."
1,What's so glamorous?,"Hey i like Trina and I dig some of her songs, but I've always found her albums to be wack. I haven't heard Baddest Bitch, but i did buy Diamond Princess (because of the song B R Right) and i was majorly disappointed, i think thats the only cd i've ever thrown away! Glamorest Life is a step up from Diamond Princess, but that isn't saying much. There are a few decent tracks on here but to be quite honest the majority of the cd is pretty laughable. I think Trina is stronger when she is a featured artist on tracks, but when it comes down to holding down her own tracks she doesn't seem to be able to pull it off. I recommend getting Lil' Kims The Naked Truth or Missy's Cookbook over Glamorest Life, because they're actually worth the money you spend on them."
5,Hot 2 Death!!!!!!!!,This is the best Trina's album to date. Here is a complete rating.Sum Mo 5/5Don't Trip 5/5Shake 5/5Here We Go 5/5Sexy Gurl 4/5Da Club 10/5It's Your B-Day 10/5I Gotta 5/5Throw It Back 5/550/50 Love 10/5So Fresh 5/5Reach Out 5/5Lil Mama 5/5
3,Glamorest Life does have glamour,"Although this is the best trina album of the series, it's not much, but it does have a few good songs, most notable was the song with Lil Wayne who really stepped his game up with the carter last year, this is a very ambitious and a good album.So I'm giving this thumbs up, because it had a stylish look.I'm recommending it."
1,You Wasted Your Money....,"If you bought this CD you wasted your perfectly earned (hopefully) money. After I Heard ""Here We Go Again"" Whatever it's called I was like how annoying can one person voice be? Kelly made the song half decent but, what else could she do since the whole song was retareded! I haven't bought the album but, I've listened to the sample. I couldn't see my self having this in my CD collection. It'd probaly bring the value down. All she talks about is how cocky her perverted commercial a$$ is. Wow! She degrades African American Females to another level. Lil Kim rhymes are way better than this trick!This CD is a cd where you let your friend buy it and you listen to it and then feel sorry for them for buying such a sucky album. I wouldn't buy it bootlegged or waste the trouble of having the MP3 file on my comptuer!"
1,Trashy Trina Does it NOT!!!,"When I look at Trina I think of a grown single mother with about four or five kids with three baby daddies. I mean, come on, she is aging and looks hard. All that make up on the cover softens her up and Photoshop is the best thing since the Atkins Diet, but blah, blah, blah,....shut up???Really, come on. She needs to get a ghostwriter b/c her lyrics are wack, weak, and just plain wrong. truthfully she is too dayum old to be rapping. Perhaps that's where I should have started and stopped. Plain and simple. It's a rap for the oldest baddest bytch in the game.Kelly sounds beautiful and i am disappointed her post-destiny child career is off to a poor start."
2,Her friends say I'm a tummy sucker don't go below the navel gotta love lil wayne!,Trina skills are really trash I tried to give her a chance but she don't have nothing interesting to talk about. The only reason I gave her two star's is because lil wayne is on the best track or shall I say the only track that can stand by itself and I believe that's only because of weezy baby!Trina go back to strippin!
3,"Stop talking about the same stuff,Trina, it's getting old!","Look everyone talks about Lil Kim, but Trina talks about the same ol'thang all the time....SEX! I'm sick of it. She doesn't have anything else to talk about??? I find that Lil Kim has more to say then Trina anyday. But I did like tracks like ""It's Your Birthday"", ""Here We Go"", ""Don't Trip"", ""Da Club"", and ""50/50 Love"". I guess if your big on Trina pick it up, if this your first time, I don't know what to tell you."
1,THE CUBIC ZIRCONIA PRINCESS IS BACK!,"Before Ghia aka thug mister came in the game Trina was qualified as the worst female rapper ever but Khia has that title on lock and isnt giving it up easily. This album is just as bad as her other two albums. Her lyrics are cheesy and the beats are secondhand garbage. The only songs with decent production are sum mo, dont trip and shake. But Trina's preschooler style of rhyming ruins them easily. For the life of me I could never understand how a female rapper can be so raunchy and be so corny at the same time! She is exactly what Britney Spears would be if she was black. I feel sorry for anybody that looks up to this voodoo doll as a role model!"
2,Here We Go With Another Album From Trina,Trina need to close her legs and open a dictionary because last time I checked Glamorest was not a word. I'm not sure if she's really that ignorant but the way she talks and acts is not very persuasive. Personally I think this whole image thing is an act and she should definitely be consider on the next award show for a grammy nomination. Trina tries way too hard to be taken seriously as a rapper and a person. She seems to have a one track mind because she never ever talk about anything. After what about 5-6 years this is the highest step Trina has taken? I give her credit for actually releasing something that is not talking about screwing licking sucking riding and prostituting for money. She has matured a notch but I cant say the samething about the album as a whole.
1,One Hit Does Not Mean a Thing,Trina need to give up rappin and go back to the pole. I'm sure she made more money there. She has what 3 albums and all of them together barely hit platinum status. She has shaked her ass done it all said it all but yet that still hasnt helped much. The point is Trina nobody really cares about you as an artist because you are boring and unoriginal. Your voice is annoying aswell and your flow is juvinile. For a grown woman that is suppose to be real you sure dont exemplify that. You have alot to learn if you think sellin yourself is keepin it real. Some people need to grow and stop trying to live a fantasy. I would probably respect you more if you showed some class and decency and gave a few words of wisdom back to young women that maybe going through what you've been through not talkin about how many women men you can screw and how much. Like Sunshine Anderson one said heard it all before.
1,Horrible,"Leave this crap in the clubs, it doesn't belong in hip-hop. Sex sells, and Trina sells it well, what a shock. Don't waste your time with garbage like this, the best female MC out is no doubt in my mind Jean Grae, she's so talented and well rounded it's scary, she is hip-hop, Trina is not.The Zapper"
3,glamorest life,"i was listening for the glamour especially with the beautiful photos of trina on the cd, not hardcore street of ballers who do not complement her or shed light on glamour. so, i wonder about the cd's focus. also, i wonder whether glamourest is an undergeneralization, overgeneralization, or overregularization?"
5,A hit as usual,Trina brings it funky and raw as usual. She is saying things you wish you could. Great CD and fun listening.
1,ha ha,"people are actually saying this rap trash is good? It's not music, it's just noise made on a computer with bad spelling. Where did the days go of real instruments and actual music. I would love to show Trina where she belongs. On the street, better yet in the sewers, exactly where my copy of this album is going! Some rap is good because it's done well. If you're going to get a rapper get missy elliott, she's at least a laugh and doesn't take herself seriously. I prefer to stick to music by Fiona Apple and Me'Shell NdegeoCello!"
5,This film is just an action packed riot,"This is a must add to your collection. I have never viewed a film that was as action packed or just plain funny as this one. The only way to describe it is James bond meets Spies like us. a must see. Actor Chris Becker was a riot, and Loukas Papas rules. The KGB agents battling the CIA and oohhhhh the hot chicks."
2,"A useless ""introduction"" to AD&D","While on the cover this set proclaims to be a sort of use-all, when you open it you recognize it to be a poor introductory game for those who haven't started their venture into real AD&D. Otherwise it is barely useful as a creation engine for dull dungeons. The monster cards are only the basicmost ones from the Monstrous Manual, without the imprtant stats at that, the Magic Items cards have more gold than magical items, and those that are there are unusable in AD&D. And, of course, the dungeon design cards are only marginally useful for creating one color dungeons where all rooms are all the same."
4,Neat Method for Solo Play,When my regular group's not around and I'm hankering for a quick game of DnD this is an easy way to play a solo session.
2,Not ther version it showed and I was expecting,"Unfortunately I received some no-name version, which I already had, instead of the Warner Bros. labelled version. Due to the inexpensive price and having been travelling thru the States at the time, I could not be bothered. However since you have been asking for a review, this is what was."
1,Junk!,"This is a dvd-r! it looks like it was transferred from a vhs. it looks absolutely horrible!My favorite complaint is that amazon sold me this, not a dishonest seller. there was absolutely no mention of this being what it really was. it was conveniently populated first for me so i didn't even realize there were other better and cheaper versions! i completely got ripped off. please use this review as fair warning and buy the better one and in the process save money!!!"
2,MADACY Golden Arm: NG,"The MADACY company video of THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM is an inferior dub made at EP speed.For a top shelf VHS of the film recorded in SP and HiFi, try this official WARNER issue:MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM (released: 2/21/95)(Note: The 2 star rating is NOT for the motion picture, which is a classic, but due to an inferior tape.)"
2,GOODTIMES Golden Arm: NG,"The GOODTIMES company video of THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM is an inferior dub made at LP speed.Product details are scant, but the movie is NOT in color and the tape is NOT in HiFi sound.For a top shelf VHS of the film recorded in SP and HiFi, try this official WARNER issue:MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM (released: 2/21/95)(Note: The 2 star rating is NOT for the motion picture, which is a classic, but due to an inferior tape.)"
4,good movie,This was a good movie. It was almost like Elvis Presley's King Creole only in this movie the guy's a heroin addict. I had just seen it about a month ago on TCM and I watched to see what it was going be like. After a while I got hooked. I thought it was a good movie. Although not as good as Elvis Presley's King Creole however. I
3,Tarnished Gold,"Yes, it's impossible to look at this groundbreaking but dated look (a jailhouse ""I need a fix!"" sequence is straight out of the Reefer Madness school of acting) at drug addiction with the same eyes as audiences of 50 years ago.Even so, production values were amazingly sanitized, even by standards of the day. If ever a film cried out for a gritty film noir look, this was it. Instead, many of the scenes are over-lit, like a Fifties TV production; meanwhile, the studio-bound street sets are as phony-looking as the intentionally stylized exteriors in Guys and Dolls--a musical! (When a genuine exterior shot of a skyscraper is briefly seen, it's almost jarring.) And as the supposedly frumpy wheelchair-ridden wife, Eleanor Parker has to be one of the best-groomed invalids in screen history."
1,Beware of which DVD you order,"The Man with the Golden Arm (2008) from: NorAm International Partners, Inc.-Sold by netdealz and Fulfilled by Amazon.arrived quickly, No problem with the service, but this is a bad print with poor sound, Marketed by CatCom, no mention that this is packaged as a double feature with Suddenly and cartoons and commercials. I should have paid more attention and bought the 50th Anniversary Edition. Bad Menu. Cheesy opening narration, The CatCom tiger does't exactly roar like the MGM lion, he kind of sounds like he is having some gas issues. Has grainy 1940's Popeye and Superman cartoons, a rather strange 1980's PSA by Clint Eastwood about the dangers of crack, a Buster Keaton beer commercial, and a 1950's safe drivin PSA. Not the disc to buy if you want a good copy of an Otto Preminger classic."
4,Insightful!,"Gerald Greenwald presents a personal account of his experiences as an executive at the Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and United Airlines and describes the lessons he learned along the way. He recounts some of the most interesting tales of corporate life in the United States, from the near collapse of Chrysler to airline labor conflicts, and uses these accounts to illuminate the failures and successes of different management styles. He discusses leadership lessons on how to motivate employees, inspire teamwork and improve communication. He writes, with the help of senior Chicago Tribune writer, Charles Madigan, in an engaging personal style that makes this an interesting read. Though we at getAbstract caution that some of Greenwald's lessons will be familiar, his congenial, thoughtful approach makes them excellent reminders of what works and what doesn't."
4,Mr. Moto a Worthy Buy,"The Moto films were made at a time that the Charlie Chan films were selling well in Hollywood. Peter Lorre was a Jew, classically trained and from Slovakia. See [...] for an interesting story on Lorre.He was small, unusual looking, and had an accent which was hard to place. The Mr. Moto series worked for him and the films are interesting. Thanks to the reworking on old films before they go to DVD, these films are easy on the eye and ear. They are interesting, and certainly worth the money. I am looking forward to the next Collection.There was a ban on Moto and Chan movies for some time recently because of Caucasians taking the roles which should have gone to Asians. That ban seems to have lifted, and we are now able to see these wonderful old classics. I recommend this collection."
2,Disappointed,"I didn't expect to see the same UCLA restored quality of the Sherlock Holmes set - even at that, I was disappointed. I know there are better ""masters"" available, I've seen much better copies of two of the movies and hoped to see at least the quality of the Charlie Chan set that I recently purchased. I was irked by the apparent bragging about the time spent in restoration which seemed about long enough to setup the equipment and the side-by-side comparison when the end product was not worth bragging about. The Moto's and Chan's are both from 20th Century but are far different in quality level. I just pre-ordered the second set of Chan movies. There will be no order for a second set of Moto movies, if and when they are available."

4,thalia's videos,"I wasn't satisfied w/this purchase. It didn't contain all the videos that were mentioned in one of the reviews. The only reason I made this purchase online was because it was supposed to come with some extra videos that the store DVD didn't contain. I ended up paying more than I would have paid at a store and getting less. At the store you could've got the DVD/CD together for less. Thalia's videos are great, there was no problem with that. Next time, I would like to see the actual contents of the DVD confirmed by borders/amazon and not by just a misleading review."
3,Some good videos,There are some good videos in this collection. All but one are in spanish. A worthwhile rental or possibly purchase.
2,Mine has broken twice,"I love my SP-350 as well as the FL-20 flash however on two subsequent dive trips the fitting on the PFL-01 housing has broken where the cable attaches. Both times I noticed it before leaving the surface and was able to save the FL-20. The first time Olympus covered it although not without some amount of hassle. I have not even bothered to contact them the second time. The problem is that the fitting and cable attach to the outside (left side) of the housing where it can come in contact with any number of things to include the boat as the crew hands the camera to the diver in the water. If they had mounted it on the right it would be somewhat protected. The second time it failed I was being extremely careful because of my first experience. Not sure what it touched but it was certainly not hard contact with anything. Other than that, the housing and flash work great."
4,Works well,"Good product, works well and more and more cameras are having them made for their specific models."
5,Warning!,"Amazon lists the language for this as English, and I ordered one from a reputable Amazon seller. It was in FRENCH, with English subtitles!If anyone can find a version that is actually in English (even dubbed would be fine) I would love to know about it. It is one of the funniest movies ever, but my folks can't read subtitles (too small) so this version was useless to us."
4,Pretty good,"This was a pretty good movie, i believe the dumb guy ""Pignon"" is a little too dumb. But very good acting, good script, good comedy all in all.The DVD has English subtitles and translates pretty well."
5,Best Movie I Have Ever Seen!,"This movie is sooooooooooooooooo funny! I was falling of the couch when I watched it.You should be able to understand French, the original language. It is absolutly Hilarious!"
5,Worth every minute,"I truly enjoyed this movie, and can watch it over and over again. If you liked ""The Closet"" try this one and vice versa"
3,Enjoyable,"I finally saw ""The Dinner Game"" this week after much anticipation. It was difficult to get a copy of the film at my local video store so I had to sign up for the online version of the store in order to access French films. Let me say I do enjoy French films immensely. I am a big Francis Veber fan, loving ""The Closet,"" ""Les Comperes"" and most recently ""The Valet."" This was highly reviewed but I have to say it was not as funny as I expected.The film is about misunderstandings and a man who doesn't have much common sense. He keeps getting our protagonist into a deep hole by basically ruining his marriage, getting him audited and just being a plain ole nuissance. You'll hate Pignon but the minute you think ""can this man be any stupider?"" he does something amazing and you like him....for a minute!Again the film is recommendable, especially if you enjoy French humor, but this is not Veber's best, at least not in my opinion."
4,"enjoyable, but the title is misleading","This is a pleasant, well-executed farce reminiscent of Almodovar. Just so you know, though, the dinner game itself really isn't the focus. It isn't actually shown on screen. It's too bad, because it's a great premise that isn't really realized the way I imagined based on how the movie was described to me. Fun movie though."
3,"funny, but a renter","I liked this movie; the story was good, the actors did a good job and I did laugh often. I recommend renting it, but not necessarily buying it."
1,garbage,"I had heard that this was hilarious, and I knew it was French. I was operating then under the delusional belief that French films must by nature be better than American films. I don't know, maybe that's true, but if so, this one was a fluke.This movie is juvenile and idiotic. It is predictible, trite, simplistic, and (worst of all) unfunny. It is more worthy of American television than French film. I was startled by how bad it was. What a waste of time."
4,Good French Comedy,"I don't speak French. It is true that much is lost intranslation, especially for a movie like this. In spiteof this fact, I still liked this movie a lot.The movie is super funny due to situations that thecharacters find themselves in. Especially when the taxcollector visits Pierre at his home. But even thebasic plot line of finding the most idiotic person towin a competetion is very funny. I will always besuspicious of people inviting me into a dinner partyafter watching this movie. :)But beware, it is different then american comedy moviesand it may not agree with your sense of humour."
4,"Very funny, but no subtitles","Having recently purchased a blu-ray movie from Amazon.fr because it was unavailable in the U. S., I was delighted to discover the film would play on my blu-ray player. There is no regional coding as with regular dvd's. However, there were no subtitles and that appears to be the case with this title. So, unless you are fluent with a foreign language film make sure there are subtitles.As for ""The Dinner Game,"" it is wickedly hilarious in much the same vein as ""La Cage Aux Folles"" and a number of other farces at which French cinema excels. A region 1 version is available on regular dvd with the obligatory subtitles and you won't regret the investment in your time and money."
5,Absolutely Hilarious,"Nothing more to say than the title. I love French film, and especially French comedy. This is subtitled which I prefer. You will not regret adding this to your library!!!"
5,A delightful comedy,"This is a film made from an original French play.Most,if not all the action takes place in a single room.The beginning of the film is a bit slow but,when all the characters are assembled on the stage the action starts.The humour is very European and one must play close attention to the conversations to understand and appreciate it all.So if you want to spend a couple of ours in front of the tube and enjoy really humorous aand witty exchanges and good character acting then this is the movie for you.I have enjoyed it and have watched it a number of times and so have some of my friends.The film is certainly a ""buy""for your collection."
5,hard to turn off,"I love scrubs and have all the seasons. It is hard to turn off, and always makes me laugh. we watch it all the time"
5,Great battery,The battery came in on time and was exactly as advertised. It is an original streamlight replacement(not a china knockoff).
3,"So far, so good.","What can I say? It's a battery and it turns the light on. :) Apparently, I'm supposed to write at least 6 more words here."
3,needs improvement,the items received was not the item described on line. I tem was returned without too much hassle but just agrivating
5,Perfect replacement and great price,Battery showed up quickly and very well package for its protection. This is an oem stinger product and was fully charged for immediate use. I got over 12 years out of the first battery that came with this light so the pain of $120 flashlight has long worn off since the quality has been proven. I used this daily while on the job when first purchased and it has since been retired to house duty where it is also well used.
4,"This is NOT for SL-20XP-LED ""UltraStinger""","This battery listed has the correct model number but only has 3 cells and mine takes 5 cells.The picture displayed shows a 5 and a 3 cell batter which can be miss-leading...Hmmm..., which one do I get?I was still able to use the battery by cutting a 1/2"" pvc pipe spacer equal to the length of the 2 missing cells.The light output was dimmer but I'm at least able to utilize the battery.The Product Features does say ""one 5-inch Battery""(3-cell length)... a 5 cell battery stick is just over 8-inches.This is some what my fault also for not really reading.I have since ordered the correct 5-cell battery stick for my SL-20XP-LED UltraStinger.I'll use this 3-cell battery stick(and the spacer) as a back-up when I go camping."
1,Misleading Photo,I am particular about the products I buy. The picture on the suppliers site showed that this was an original Streamilght battery stick. What I received was a Chinese made copy. I consider this to be misleading.
2,Streamlight Stinger Battery,"I purchased this battery on Amazon in November, 2009, from another supplier. Much like a couple of the reviews mentioned I received a battery ""Made in China"". I didn't think much of it at the time. It seemed to charge in the same amount of time and have about the same battery life as the OEM that lasted me numerous years.I have now noticed I get about 10 minutes on a full charge. My old ""original"" battery lasted me about 10 years and got me around 1 hour of use per charge. This is less than a year old and I have been using the flashlight the same as I always have.Moral of the story, in this case saving money will not be a benefit if you use your flashlight frequently. I will not buy a ""Made in China"" battery for my stinger ever again.I'm not bashing ""Made in China"" and I don't normally write reviews, but keep my review in mind when ordering."
1,Bait and switch,"I ordered this so called streamlight battery for my stinger thinking it was a great price compared to our local retailers. When the item was delivered it was not a streamlight battery, rather some made in China knock off. The company offered to refund my money if I returned the battery but it was going to be a pain for shipping so I just cut my losses. My point is if you say you are selling a genuine part with a picture and send me something different, that's just wrong. I guess it was to good to be true."
3,The battery is OK,"This whole system is a dinosaur in the the world of lithium ion batteries and CREE bulbs. Streamlight is hanging on to the customers that paid too much for their lights and can't buy lithium ion batteries that will work with this design. The new $15 Chinese lights are ten times more powerful than the Stinger HP and the lithium ion batteries are cheaper, last longer and available everywhere. This whole system is like a black and white TV."
5,"The ""Real Thing""... not the look alikes","This is the real Streamlight Factory Original Equipment Battery - NOT the cheap look-a-likes others are pushing. To my knowledge, this battery fits all the Stinger type family of products, and they ARE of recent (date) manufacture, not two or three years old already, as some sellers are pushing. Buy it!"
5,Perfect replacement,"With all the reviews about getting some off brand battery I was a little nervous about ordering. When the package arrived, it was an exact replacement of what I had. I am very pleased with it."
5,So Far So Good,I purchased two of the Stinger batteries which actually came from Coast To Coast Safety Inc. and I have to say I was a little on edge by some of the other reviews. When they arrived they were Genuine Streamlight parts and so far they have work better then I have expected. I plan to do business with both Amazon and Coast To Coast Safety Inc. in the future.
1,rip off,"When I ordered this product, I thought I was getting different songs from the Star Wars trilogy movies - actual original soundtrack recordings. But these cds are phony electronically created synthetic versions of what would otherwise be wonderful music. They sound horrible. I strongly DO NOT recommend this product!"
2,Not Your Father's Laban,"This is a poor rehash of the more valuable original works by Rulolf Laban. The impression given is that Newlove's father's work seemd to stand stagnant, but there is nothing new here. There are even forays into areas that Laban would never have agreed with. For example, the instruction concerning the use of illusionary weight by the stage artist is highly flawed and mistaken. Laban's work never advocated such a technique. The crafted performer will learn more useful information from the master's original writings."
5,All the Best from Lonely Planet,"An excellent compilation by Lonely Planet, entirely useful and a great package for anyone dreaming of or going to Mexico. I know from personal experience that the Spanish in Mexico is very different from other areas of the world, so I recommend learning the Mexican version instead of the more commonly taught Castillian. Pues, andale guey! You're well on your way with Lonely Planet."
2,old yeller,"movie came in on time. however, it did not have a case with it. it was just the tape and that is it."
3,Review,Watched this with my son necause he was reading the book.He enjoyed it.....until Old Yeller diedwould recommend if someone was looking to have a good cry.
1,DISPLEASURE WITH DVD,"The DVD arrived within specified time, with no delays. HOWEVER, since it came from Great Britian, it can not be played on my DVD player. It was not expensive, therefore, am not returning as it would be too much trouble and costly to return. I still want a Disney Old Yeller DVD, but obviously one that can be played. The message on the screen said CAN NOT BE VIEWED IN THIS REGION. I sent the seller an e-mail, he responded with various things that could be tried, but don't understand."
1,Did I miss the fine print?,Sent this movie as a gift to 86-year old mother-in-law. Did not realize it was coming from Great Britain. Will not play in her DVD player. Different formatting?
1,Old Yeller,I was so excited to get this movie ! I waited over month and half for it to show up. When it finally did and I put it in the DVD player it said could read the region. I looked up online what that meant and it said from another. Country..So i bascially Paid for a movie I will never be able to watch. I am Very Very unhappy about this!!!!!
2,Non US region coding,There is no mention of the region coding in the product description for this particular version of the DVD. I didn not think about it being shipped from the UK that it would not be compatible with my US DVD player. Most other product descriptions specify the region coding and this description needs to be updated.
2,Dissapointed me,"First, you must know I love animals, I love movies and I love movies in which I can cry my heart out. I have cried on almost every movie I have ever saw, but somehow this movie didn't make me cry.I guess that isn't a real bond for having a dog for such a small period of time....It's a nice movie, not big deal"
1,Worst Doggone movie is the world!!!!!!!,"I watched this film because everyone said it is a classic. Like many classics it is anything but. Why does everyone cry at this movie? I didn't cry at this movie; I didn't anything close to tears. This is not because I hate dogs, I think that dogs are not people and that the dog was better off after he was shot. Also this movie may have been much better if the acting had be decent. The acting of the boy made me laugh instead of cry when the dog died. And if his little brother had spoken one more time I would have screamed. This same little boy is in many Disney films and every time he is unbarable. So unless you have a love for punnishment don't watch this movie."
1,Stop killing dogs,I can't stand it when dogs die in the movies.I'd much rather watch people die before dogs.I could laugh my butt off watching Meryl Streep in pain from cancer in that dumb movie with Renee Zellweger before I can stand to see a dog suffer.Just tears your heart out.
3,Disney's Classic Coming-of-Age Film,"When pa Fess Parker has to take a long trip, he entrusts the care of ma Dorothy McGuire and little Arliss to older son Travis, played by Tommy Kirk of ""Shaggy Dog"" fame. Life isn't easy on a Texas farm in the 1860s and that Arliss sure is a handful for Travis. Then a stray dog comes on the scene, one that doesn't so much bark as yell, and so earns the name Old Yeller. Travis learns to love and rely on Old Yeller as the two go through many adventures together, until Yeller bravely saves the whole family at a crucial juncture. But there's one more lesson in growing up in store for Travis regarding Old Yeller before Pa's return, one that marks the turning point between boy and man. A good movie to watch with children above the age of eight."
4,A childhood classic.,"Wow, I dug up this old classic to watch with my youngest son. I almost forgot about the end, and both of us where teary eyed at the end. It has a good message and is just a great movie."
4,Some old school filmmaking,"This film was a part of my childhood and always makes me cry like a schoolgirl. There, I said it. I think anyone can appreciate this movie. It has a moral sensibility you dont find in movies these days and the pace and flow are very distinct as well. Disney flicks from this era are period pieces of a sort and they don't deliver the bang of a modern film. Even so, they resonate somehow and I heartily reccomend this one and others like Swiss Family Robinson, Hot Lead and Cold Feet, Bullwhip Griffin and a host of other Disney fare from that era. With all the new tools available to Hollywood taday you can lose the ability to enjoy films like this, so buy some and pop them in the DVD player on a rainy afternoon."
1,Plantronics Vehicle charging adapter,This was posted as being an adapter that would fit my headset that I was ordering. Doesn't fit it.
2,Doesn't FIT,It says as if its a general charger for plantronics...but I see no way it fits for the charge!
4,One the best book for hydraulic structures,"Complete theory of hydraulic structures: gates, stoplogs, etc.Contain tables, diagrams, drawing and formulas.Necessary for all engineer who do hydraulic projetcs. The only problem is it is written in Germany"
5,great film,this film has replay value. fast paced. that leung has some very interesting moves. I especially remember his remarkable battle with the wooden warriors.
2,unable to use,"This item was purchased as a supplement for visual learners, howeverit does not work on your average DVD player. It will only play via a computer and hopefully you also have the components to project it onto a screen."
2,I don't wanna go down to the basement,"Dee Dee Ramone's first novel is about a miserable creep named Dee Dee Ramone. Well, they say write about what you know. The book doesn't start off too bad, detailing Dee Dee's (fictionalized) life at the Chelsea Hotel. But things go downhill when a group of dead punk rockers show up and try to get Dee Dee to join a human sacrificing Satanic cult. None of the characters in this book act believably, not even the Dee Dee character. I am a big fan of Dee Dee, but this book revels in his worst traits, which are his misanthropy and self hated. This is a very unpleasant book, which most people will not enjoy."
4,gabba gabba r.i.p,dee dee's first book poison heart was very depressing but excellent. This book is funny and a good read.r.i.p DEE-DEE U ARE GRAND
1,"Next time, leave the Punk Rockers in Hell.","I don't know if i'm not up on things or what but this book never really made sense to me. The first half was ok. It was gory and pointless but at least I could understand where Dee Dee was going. However, when all of his punk rock friends show up as ghosts, everything goes to hell, literally. The rest of the book is a frantic, drug-induced dream that I don't really care to read about. Everything about this book is a mess and it should be kept off of every intelligent reader's bookshelf."
1,why buy this book when you can just talk to people on drugs for free?,"worst book ive ever read. ever. totally horrible. the gore is kinda okay at first, but then it just gets too surreal. like a dream, but not a cool dream. its like when you have some dream you thought was super cool, and then you tell your friend, and your friend is like ""wow not only does that make no sense, but you are totally retarded"". anyways, this book is a total waste of time and money, and all i learned from it is dont stay at the chelsea hotel or you will get AIDS, or get murdered."
1,review,"This book was a very large let down to anyone that took the book serious enough to read it. It did have a good plot but I'm sorry to disrespect Dee Dee but he is an awfull writer, it had no horror to it except what a child could have written in elementary school and the grammer is just a disgrace. And if you're not going to pay attention to this review then go ahead and waste about 3-4 hours reading it because trust me it shouldn't take any longer then that."
4,Renaissance Man in a Black Leather Jacket,"He writes marvelously autobiographical songs, he plays and sings marvelously autobiographical material, he has written a marvelous autobiography (in two versions), so it should come as no surprise, that this - Dee Dee Ramone's first novel - is marvelous and autobiographical. It is also vastly entertaining. The various themes - drugs, punks, junkies and drunks - will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with Dee Dee's work. The underlying theme of constant horror is also found in much of Dee Dee's work, especially as it relates to the general horror of mental illness. Dee Dee has done quite a lot with his themes, and this book will please any long-time Ramones fan, and might pleasantly surprise those who were previously unfamiliar or unimpressed with both Dee Dee and The Ramones. This is a stellar first novel, and I only hope there are more where this came from."
3,Burroughs reincarnated...,"This is quite possibly one of the strangest, disjointed bizarre books I have ever read...since Burroughs' Naked Lunch. Dee Dee, as the central character, seeks to and ultimately manages to injest every hardcore drug possible. And he still finds the time to kill a transvestite, encounter the ghosts of junkies past and communicate with his dog. (Which is reminiscient of the post-apocalyptic film,A Boy & His Dog) The book is sickening but not in a blood and guts way. It's sickening in a 'junkie-rollercoaster-stream of consioucness' way. The lack of lucidity and continuity tends to be like a carnival ride. Burroughs isn't dead, he's just hiding in Dee Dee Ramone's body. Simply put: if this were made into a movie it would be directed by David Cronenberg or David Lynch."
4,hahaha,"You will either love or hate this book. I had to love it. It goes from normal to completely nuts very quickly. It's fun to have a soundtrack for this book in your head too. Two songs come to mind when he's talking about the basement of the Chelsea-- Ramones - I dont want to go down to the basement-- and Johnny Thunders - In Cold Blood: 'you probably think i'm pretty mad, just because i go down there i said hey don't you worry dear, you'll never end up there...'... You take in all the stuff in this book, and then like a few hours later it hits you when you're driving in your car and you're picturing DeeDee smoking crack with candy the transexual, and you can't stop laughing for ten minutes. I don't understand how any Ramones fan could NOT like this book!"
5,Great stuff!,"I've found this stuff to work great for both short and long hair (.5 to 3 inches give or take). This product is essentially waterproof to where you'll need to shampoo your hair once or twice to get most of it out. I like this especially because my hair's kinda hard to style, but this seems to work best. Additionally, it will keep it's form for a few days practically even if you wear a motorcycle helmet or something else that would otherwise mess it up."
4,Awsome but expensive.,"This stuff makes my hair look thicker and holds it in place pretty well. Though other products do the same thing for cheap, I'm always told that the texture this gives is far superior and I haven't had a girlfriend let me use anything else. Smells good too.This is the best price I've found, but its still quite pricey. Similar products are about $3 for the same weight in Kmart."
3,Amazon badly described this book,"""Excerpt - Page 78: ""... Site [...] MARCO SASSONE to the Marco Sassone wcbsite ...""I bought this book solely because the above description implied the book contained information about Marco Sassone. IT DOES NOT! Other than a photo of the home page of his Web site on page 78 and a three sentence review on the back cover that Marco wrote about this book, there is absolutely nothing anywhere else in the book about Marco Sassone or his paintings. As a collector of information about his paintings, this book is useless to me,folklib net / sassone (insert a ""."" and remove the spaces)Somebody made a buck off me due to false advertising."
3,I wish...,"Fabric Dyeing for BeginnersIf you are looking for a book that explains COTTON dyeing this book is very nice. it has a lot of pictures, very nice explanations. I wish the book's name was cotton dyeing for beginners. Most of the techniques are a bit tie dye-ish. Also when I was reading it I realized the book was not binded very well, so now I have single pages stuck in between the book. It is a nice book but not one that I would like to read over and over."
4,What to Know about the whole process.,"This book tells you all of the details of fabric dyeing. It will allow you to decide whether or not you even want to attempt it. In my case I decided that I don't. Unless there is a fabric you really can't find, (hard to believe) or you simply like big messes, why bother."
5,the iRobot is the best !,I used to spend hours a day cleaning my pool. I have 2 dogs that are in the pool every day and the dirt and hair is uncontrollable until I purchased the iRobot. I use it every other day and it runs for 3 hours. it never gets tangled and the fine dirt and hair that it picks up is amazing. now I have time to do what I want. I love it!!
1,pathetic,"I have owned pools over 40 years. This is one of the worst gimmicks I have seen. A dozen small leaves will stop it. Shock residue will clog either bag. It must be cleaned after each use,which means you remove the bag and dig everything out and rinse the bag. This machine will work in a completely spot-less pool. But,in that case why would you need it. If you want an automated pool cleaner, spend $1500-$2500 on a real cleaner that runs off a pressure port."
3,Not for me,"I love iRobot (have a Roomba and a Scooba), and was excited to get the Verro. But I didn't see how I could realistically live with a device that I would have to drop in and pull out from the pool with every use, as compared to a skimmer line-driven device. Then there's removing the bag and washing it. Although I would not have to clean my pump filter as often, it just seemed like I'd be spending a lot more time on the pool than with a traditional pump-driven robot on my skimmer line. I do appreciate that the Verro likely cleans my pool better, and puts less wear on my pump. But I can't quite justify the cost when there's the additional time required."
2,Up Hill Battle,"I love my Roomba. Unfortunately the Verro 300 doesn't compare. It did a great job on the deep end of the pool, but never, no matter the timing adjustments we made, would return to the shallow end. I didn't keep it. Not worth $700.00 to only keep half the pool clean."
1,Not for dusty climates,"I tried the Verro 300 for two weeks, with very mixed results. We live in Palm Desert, which can be very windy and there is a lot of airborne sand. The regular bag is too porous to catch the sand, and the fine bag clogs almost immediately. After talking to the factory, my conclusion is that this unit is not for dusty areas. Also, the unit won't climb curved steps (mine are) and it took two cleaning cycles to cover a 16x32 pool. If you live where leaves and debris are your problem, the 300 would probably work. But if you need to get the sand out on a daily basis, don't get this item."
4,overall - good device,"I've been using this robot about 2 weeks now and I am quite pleased with it. In general it does a good job, it collects most of the leaves from the bottom of my pool and climb over most of it's walls. Where it fails to clean is the round areas at the extreme of the pool, so I have to brush it and make sure the dirt goes to the path that the robot cleans.Is it perfect ? noIs it worth the money - yes.You still need some manual work with it, but it cuts the amount of work you do by 80%-90%.Update: August 2009:I still use this robot and it works well. The fine bag is a bit messed up but it is looking good for a 1.5 years old bag. In general - I would buy this robot again."
1,BAD WARRANTY SERVICE,"We purchased a Verro 300 in April. The plug on the power supply broke after 2.5 months of use! When calling iRobot, we discovered they DO NOT support the warranty on these machines. We were sent to a company called AquaProducts that makes the machines for iRobot. After many emails and phone calls, we were left with having to pay to send the power supply to NJ for repair. Since the plug was loose upon receipt, we don't feel this was a satisfactory solution. We will discontinue use of this machine.....have already bought another pool cleaner. This was a very expensive $700 bad lesson......"
2,Irobot Verro 100,iRobot Verro 100 Pool-Cleaning Robot for Above-Ground PoolsAfter running great for two days it blew its fuse. We replaced the fuse but it would no longer run. We could not get any technical support from the iRobot number the call routed to a singles dating site. When provided with a second number no one answered the phone. We tried email but no one returned our emails. After two frustrating days we called to request how to return the product for our money back. No one seemed to care we could not get any service.
2,Kinda dumb,"I ordered this as a result of its high recommendation in Wise and Bauer's book (The Well-Trained Mind), as well as good reviews on Amazon. I was greatly disappointed.The layout was not professional, and had so many disjointed graphics that it would be completely distracting for a child to use. It has trite little positive thoughts on every page which are supposed to inspire the child/student to learn. Yet, it totally lacks any instructions on how to use each lesson or concrete exercises.Since I am not a certified elementary teacher (but a college professor) I wanted to give the book a real chance. So, I showed the book to my mother (a veteran 3rd grade teacher of 38 years). Her comment? ""This is dumb. Send it back."" 'Nuff said."
4,Has helped a lot.,"First, here's our situation: we have a son who is 5 years old. We limit his TV (by not having one), and we read to him incessantly. He really loves books. He clearly has an aptitude for reading. About 8 months ago, I bought this book. At that point, he was attempting to read on his own. He would do fine usually, but often, he would just guess something that wasn't even close -- it was clear he had some words memorized, but with other he looked at how it began and ended, then just guessed a word.While this book may not exactly be turnkey (it took a tiny bit of adaptation to make it work), he started looking forward to impromptu lessons. Within a couple weeks, the difference in his approach was noticeable -- there was a marked improvement. He is starting kindergarten in the fall, and our best guess is that he is now reading somewhere between a second and a third grade level. The bottom line is that this book really works."
3,No english available,"Bought the Korean version (better price). Info said that it had both English and Korean language available. However, no menu was available to switch to English. Only thing I missed was the director's comments, which were in Korean. The music is great."
5,Fantasia dvd,DvD was received in excellent condition and in a timely manner. Strongly recommend the seller. Tom Whelan
5,Fantasia DVD,I received this item in excellent condition and faster than I expected! I would definitly order from this vendor again with no reservations! I also feel the price was very reasonable. Thank you.
3,Fantasia,"This was a re-order. I was trying to replace a back order that did not work out. This was for my niece who wanted it for nostalgic reasons (we love Fantasia and all our children watched it a lot as small children). We were surprised that it was in Korean (yes it says ""South Korean Pressing""). I thought it was produced in Korea but would be in English (or subtitled). The music and video is still wonderful."
4,Fun fro all ages,"I noticed that a lot of the reviews for Fantasia say it's for adults or older children. I disagree. I think it depends on the child. We have this VHS tape and my 3 1/2 year old has almost worn it out from playing it so much. He adores about 90% of the film (although the dinosaur part and the Dance of the Hours are his favorites) and does not seem particularly scared or bothered by ""Night on Bald Mountain"" which he will watch by himself. He also loved to listen to the audiotape in the car. At this point if any of the Fantasia or Fantasia 2000 music comes on the classical radio station we listen to he can recognize it and tell you which film and what part it's from. I think that some small children will really like this movie and you need to give them a shot by exposing them to it rather than assuming they will be bored."
4,Finally on DVD but not quite,"It's wonderful to finally have the original Fantasia on DVD, and I'm glad Roy Disney went to the trouble to restore it to the roadshow version. The only real complaint I have is that the voice you hear is NOT that of Deams Tailor but of a voice actor used to restore sound quality to the footage. Kind of unsettling and jarring, when I am so familiar with Mr. Tailor's voice and the remastered version that came out on video and LaserDisc."
4,Classic,"This 1940 film is a definite classic, though many people don't know that the version they see today was actually edited from the original, since the original had some racism in it (namely in the scene with centaurs) You can find these deleted scenes on YouTube.There's a nice variety of short stories, including the famous one where Mickey is a sorcerer's apprentice and tries to get out of a menial chore by using magic that actually makes the situation worse. The music for this film is great, with some memorable numbers, and the artwork is gorgeous - I loved the dancing flowers!"
4,EDITED VERSION OF FANTASIA,This is a Korean knock-off version that has been edited to remove about 20 minutes of the talking content between the music selections.Good quality technically. For me the edits were fine since it's for my grandkids. Anyone looking for the original movie (with its Deems Taylor interviews explaining the music) would not be happy.
3,Disappointed,"I thought there would be an updated version,and I sent this to my grandchildren.Of course the old version was not of any interest to my grandchildren"
3,I love the movie,Don't get me wrong...I love the movie! What ticked me off is the fact the sender did not disclose the fact the talking is in Japanese. The only reason I did not send it back is because there isn't that much talking...if there was more talking I would have sent it back for sure. Again LOVE THE MOVIE. It is one of the best ways to introduce a child to classical music.
3,I wish my VHS still worked,"The beauty of Fantasia is as immortalized as we can at present have it. However, this version is an unfortunate possessor of the ultra-close-up moment during the Pastoral scene. This distorts the image and makes it very grainy, hindering the viewing experience in such a startling manner that it actually cast a shadow over what has traditionally been one of my favorite portions. It is important to note that the tampering was done to cover/remove racially inappropriate material, but their solution left me wanting. I'm a much bigger fan of the ""roving foliage"" technique, as, while obvious and hilarious when you notice it, it does not burden the skill and beauty of the animation. Oddly enough, they used both techniques in this version, and I'm not certain why. Sticking to one would have been far more appropriate."
3,Scratchy Fantasia,"This old masterpiece was most enjoyable, but unfortunately the quality of the VCR was only so-so: scratchy in places, it skipped here and there and the sound was not top quality."
4,A CLASSIC,"With Mickey Mouse, a beloved generation spanning Icon, Fantasia, is an upbeat, vibrantly colored, beautifully orchestrated work of animated art sure to delight the senses. And it'll make the kids laugh."
3,Different Generations,I was really excited to buy this movie and see it again and show it to the children. I thought that they would enjoy it... boy was I wrong!I guess that's the difference between my generation and kids nowadays... they have to have protagonist and an antagonist and some kind of plot!! They were really upset that all there was to it was music and short clips.Personally I loved it... but I guess this is the age of spongebob squarepants nonsense (don't get me wrong I love the little guy) but there isn't really much appreciation for the more classy works!Times are changing...
2,Unfortunate editing,"This applies toFantasia (Special 60th Anniversary Edition)I have loved Fantasia since seeing it as a kid in the late 1940s, and had hoped for a perhaps cleaner/remastered DVD copy of what I already have (the 1991 VHS 2-tape release, which is very good). Unfortunately, in excising an admittedly racist-appearing segment within the Beethoven ""Pastorale"", *this* version uses a glaringly-apparent close zoom into the artwork - which is downright ugly and pretty much ruins the viewing experience. While I'm inclined to agree with taking the scene out, I think it was done much better on the VHS tape (I never noticed the deletion, not recalling the scene all that well from my first exposure)."
4,magical,"very satisfied with this purchase; I guess that if you pay a few extra $ you can probably get a better package (if you really want to), but apart from that everything is good in terms of quality of video/sound."
5,Fantasia (the original uncut version) is truly inspiring and AMAZING!,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! A must see for all ages. The music is beautiful and emotional while the animation matches perfectly with the instruments and melodies! I can watch it over and over or just listen to it as background music.
5,AMAZING.....!,We had Fantasia on video for our children during the early nineties. Somehow we lost it but now our son (21 years old by now) gave us Fantasia on DVD. It is still as beautiful and amazing as it was to us in 1992 (or when produced by Disney in 1942...?) Hard to get but every dollar worth it!
4,It's pretty good considering the age of the original.,"Fantasia has always been a favorite movie of mine and it still is. The quality of the artwork is not up to today's crisp standards, but it is true to the original. I was worried when I saw reviews that Disney had cut up the Pastoral piece, but it was okay. I didn't even notice it. The part I did notice is that Disney included the extended parts where the narrator speaks. While he does go on and tell you the whole story about the next piece, you can pick up your remote and skip it.Overall very good job. Overall really pricey too."
2,Censored!,"My boyfriend uploaded the cut scenes from the movie. Look up ""Sunflower clip banned from Disney's Fantasia"" and you can see the three scenes in full! And if they don't show up, email me for the links!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!,"this is not the original version on vhs or laser disc, you will be diasppointed"
1,It was in Korean,Perhaps I wasn't careful enough in reviewing my purchase but the DVD was the Korean version. Don't remember seeing that explained on the internet before I purchased.
1,A Bad Excuse For Great Classical Music,"This movie has proven to be one of the most boring movies of all time. For 125 minutes you have to watch gosh-awful (Well not for that time) drawings put in sync with some pieces of really good music. The result is boring excuse for a movie. I stopped this mid-way because I hated it so much and I was bored out of my mine. And I'm considered to have a long attention-span. Those of you with short attention-spans hate this movie. It's boring, it's old, and it's not worth it. Save your money."
4,Great,Bought this for my 1 year old daughter. It is an excellent way to introduce children to music.
1,Faulty product,This was a gift for Xmas. I am now informed that it is not recognized by a DVD player or a computer. It appears to be a defective product. Would you replace it with a working product ?
2,It's not what Disney sells.,"I was going to give this as a Christmas gift but I failed to look closely at the details and thought I was purchasing a Disney product. I should have clicked on the larger view and scrolled more to read the full details. The folks I was going to give it to will probably think i bought it bootleg from a flea market.... lovely!! I guess I will just keep it to remind me how assumptive I was! LESSON LEARNED. Shipped quickly though, so thanks!"
1,FANTASIA,"MAJOR RIP OFF .......IN KOREAN NOT COMPLETE......ID LIKE MY $ BACK...SO IF YOU DON'T SPEAK KOREAN RUNN AND IF YOU ARE OK WITH IT BEING IN COMPLETE THEN THATS GREAT HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT WALT DISNEY'S FANTASIA ...THIS IS AWFUL FOR THE MONEY"
3,A little Disappointed,"Remembering how outstanding my experience seeing this in the theatre many years ago, I ordered it in Blue Ray expecting to duplicate or at least simulate the viewing experience on my own TV. Were we disappointed to learn that in order to stretch it to the size of our larger screen, the wide version viewing we had hoped we'd get was merely paintings along the sides of the smaller screen to change them from black to boring and somewhat off-putting. I realize it's our own fault for not investigating further, but it's a lesson learned that I am hoping to other clueless blue ray owners. My recommendation; dust off your old VHS copy and crank up the volume. Better yet, close your eyes and remember."
5,The Best Fantasia,"This is the perfect Fantasia DVD. I know some poeple did not like it going straight back to the menu after the last frame of Ave Maria. Thats how the film ended. It faded right out after Ave Maria. The credits were added later (Its so obvious and the people walking off stage must have been taken from the intermission scene.) And no that is not Deems Taylor voice. The original audio stems have been long lost. Anyway this is the best Fantasia. I mean the sound is excellent, the picture is superb. I mean you can make out people's face in the orchestra. If you have a two input televion, and the old and new release, have them both at the same spot paused. Then go htrough the input and make a comparison. What a difference. I;'m very glad I did not have to wait until I had kids before they released this. This is excellent."
5,One of The Greats,"*Fantasia (G)- Fantasia is quite simply one of the greatest films ever made. In fact, it is a milestone in Art and Pop culture. I believe it stands just as high as Citizen Kane in important American films. How a US film, albeit a ""cartoon"", was able to get away with nudity and cultist revelry at the height of Hays' Code hysteria stands as an achievement that few even comprehend. Few people love all 2 hours of Fantasia, but there are also few who don't like a single piece. And that is a testament to art in and of itself. Fantasia is a walk through an art gallery and a symphony hall. Some of it may draw you to tears, some of it may baffle you and some may enrage you but at least it made you feel and think something."
4,Surprise! This is the Korean edition,"I loved Fantasia when I was a kid, and it was now time to share it with my grandchildren. I was satisfied with the price, quality and availability of this product, but, when my daughter first inserted the DVD into the player, she was disconcerted to find that the language of the speaker and the settings was Korean. She's a clever woman and she managed to fiddle with the controls to find how to switch both the spoken and subtitled portions to English, but there was no indication in the ad on Amazon that this would be necessary, and no instructions accompanying the item as to how to adjust the settings for language.Great show, but I think that the marketing was unclear at the least, and possibly misleading. I am disappointed in the seller, whose response to my emailed comments was unsatisfactory to me."
1,BE PREPARED TO BE DISAPPOINTED!!!,"As a child, I grew up watching the ""almost original"" VHS copy of my favorite Disney film of all-time.Since purchasing the DVD, I was thoroughly disappointed. The redubbing of Deems Taylor's dialogue was blasphemous, and I'm sure that it could be easily restored with the technology we have today. Also, another point of interest is the censored ""Black Centaur"" scene (talk about 'political correctness'). Hasn't anyone seen the recent ""Donald Duck"" and WWII cartoon shorts from the ""Walt Disney Treasures"" series? They can at least have someone come on before the movie to warn those who may be offended by an animated African-American caricature.All I can say is I hope Disney will have the common sense to faithfully restore the entire ""Roadshow"" edition on DVD and Blu-Ray next year for their upcoming ""Diamond"" release in Fall 2010. Oh, I pray that the day will finally come!!!"
5,Fantasia 60th Anniversary DVD,Have been looking for some time to replace/upgrade my VHS tape version of Fantasia so was happy to see this on Amazon. Was not disappointed in any way when the DVD arrived and I watched it.ThanksCraig
5,Never received the item. Integrity_Fusion is without integrity,"As numerous e-mails have clearly shown, this product was never delivered and I've had the charge removed from my credit card."
2,"case was smashed, but dvd was fine","Arrived in poor condition, the dvd case was smashed, and broken into pieces. I have ordered many dvd's in the mail, and the senders usually use the same packaging: a padded envelope. This sender also used a padded envelope, so it may have been broken before it was shipped."
3,Fantasia,"When I received this order, it was scratched and would not play. Returned for a refund with no problem , but I had to pay return postage."
5,"Great idea, great movie.","I liked the idea of mixing classical music with the unlimited possibilities of animation. I think my favorite part was the one accompained with Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"". It could be because i happen to like this composition. Oh and the part with Mickey Mouse is very lovely until Mickey destroys the broom. The broom took vengeance though. Every piece became a new broom. Ha, ha, take that Mickey. I still like Mickey though."
5,"When it's sold out everywhere else, you know it is excellent","A must have for every family, with or without kids. There is something for everyone on this tape. My 4 year old son loves it and has gained an appreciation not just for classical music, but for different classical music styles.Also, the visuals are rich and stimulating. They don't make animation like this anymore."
3,*korean* fantasia,"It would have been nice to know beforehand that I was purchasing a Korean version of Fantasia. Sure, I can add English subtitles, but as I don't read/understand Korean- it's annoying to sort through the options randomly. What if this was a gift? Ugh.3 stars because at least it works."
5,I've always loved Fantasia,"(Review written by a woman, the account is my partner's) Evidently the Disney vault doesn't extend to Italy. Got to love the Italians. I couldn't find this available; I had no idea that you really can't find something that's in the Disney vault. Thank you Italy! I mean, it took forever to get here but having lived in Italy I didn't expect anything different. Fantasia itself doesn't need a review (it's obviously breathtaking), the only thing is it wasn't recognized by my DVD player (which is not a spring chicken) but there was no problem on the computer, I just needed to set the computer's DVD player to European settings and the language to English (a window popped up)."
3,I hate being misled,"Advertised as ""Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.0.."", the sound here is in stereo only."
3,Not for ages under 4,"Scary parts - dinos with huge teeth and a bloody battle -- with new and raw emotions, this was a bit too scary for my young child. I enjoyed the historical context and the narration, and my young child LOVES some of it"
3,not what i expected...,"Despite how long Fantasia has been out I just watched it the other day and I was quite disapointed. I didnt know what to expect when I watched it but I kinda thought it would be more of a cartoon with a story line. I did not care for the orchistra in it, it got old after a while. I watched the VHS version and the video quality was not all that great. I dont really know how to put it but it was just a blah blah movie to me, the animation was great at some parts while at others it was just boring and it got very old after a while. well thats what I think about it, if you like classical music and no talking throughout the whole movie and a very strange plot, the you will prob like it a little better than I did."
2,"Sorry, I can't give this one the raves.....","...that most others do. As one who grew up watching Disney flicks at the theater every Saturday, this one is my all-time least favorite. The problem with ""Fantasia"" is that it's a film that adults love because they think they would have adored it as children. In fact, it's hard to keep kids occupied with this film, with its endless interruptions to have Mickey chat up the conductor. Boring for adults and unbearable for youth with short attention spans. I remember being bored to death watching it at six, and so were the other kids, because we had more fun having popcorn fights and running up and down the aisles than we did watching the movie. Try parking your eight year old in front of it and clock how long it takes him to get bored and walk away, and you'll see the real disappointment in this movie."
1,"broken packaging, ordered through amazon but from another supplier","This is a great movie for kids though i'm interrested in seeing the newer edition, you can tell that this was dated. I am not giving the movie a poor review i am giving the sender a poor review because when i recieved the dvd the the casing was broken and i had to tape it back together. I did not return it because there was nothing wrong with the disc itself and didnt feel it was worth the effort of sending it back."
5,very good,i recived the product in good condition there is nothing wrong with them. the most exciting thing is its fastest delivery. i bought a lot of stuff from amazon but this one is good in keeping its promise of delivery date. thanks
1,Like a chocolate covered cyanide capsule,"Entering a city can be said to be entering a microcosm,and so the ""Black Magical World of Disney"" would be amicrocosm within a larger microcosm. And there is no denyingthe enchantment and worldwide appeal of this land of illusion,nor the impressiveness of its psychological and spiritualconstructs. It certainly captures the imagination of theimpressionable and helps to nurture passivity - like Hanseland Gretel, they know what kids want! Moving pictures withbold, vivid colors accompanied by hypnotic music during alphastate has results most would not even comprehend nor accept.Even adults find themselves back at that magical teat, beinggently rocked back to sleep in the warm arms of theirsurrogate mother of entertainment.Jeez... it's like the ""Night on Bald Mountain"" everywhere I looknowadays."
1,my dumb mistake,"Some laserdisc descriptions emphasized the format such as ""SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS laserdisc-NOT A DVD OR VHS-must have a laserdisc player to use"". I mistakenly ordered the wrong media thinking it is a dvd because it is labeled ""Walt Disney's Masterpiece Fantasia (Laserdisc) Format: DVD"". My search was for Fantasia dvd and I did not notice the mistake since I depended on the warning to be like the other laserdisc descriptions."
3,Fantasia meets hunger,This isn't a review. I'm going to be highly original and have a rant about a product that hasn't been released yet. Because Amazon let me.Actually I won't lower myself to that. I'm hungry.
1,Bored to tears.,"Why did I buy this? Neither me, my daughter or girlfriend liked this. After the only one scene my grandaughter liked ""where is mickey?"""
3,Great Movie,"Great movie but hard to get kids to watch, especially with the band narrations at the beginning of each skit...."
1,Reason for Return,"The description on Amazon's website stated that this DVD was in both English and Korean. When I put it in the DVD player, the menu was in Korean. I clicked on each of the three icons to see if I could find one that would change the language. The first one started the movie in Korean, the second one selected the scenes to view and the third one was for bonus tracks. These were the only choices.. There were no other screens to go to."
1,i own the original on vhs,"Since my vcr is still working... And I want my grandchildren to experience the movie the way I did, I will not be purchasing a censored version. I think the censorship diminishes the historic significance of the film. To leave it as is would provide parents the opportunity to have a dialogue with their children about any questions. Shame on Disney for not preserving the original or at least making it available to those who have enough sense to look beyond 'correctness'."
5,It's good.,"I thought kids wouldn't like this because of the lack of dialogue, but I was dead wrong. My girls loved it, and my grandchildren love it yet."
4,Good but not great.,"The quality was excellent as was the audio. I purchased this hoping it would have the deleted & edited scenes with the black centaur, no such luck."
3,Amazing graphic!,"First of all, I must say that my son and I were very, very impressed with the art work in this. Considering this movie was made in the 1940's and how they did the annimated features back then, it took a lot of hard work, dedication, and talent for all involved to do this. I was amazed!!!My favorite scene is the Nutcracker piece. My second favorite was mickey mouse :-) We didn't really care for the others (though the Soundtrack part was pretty cute.We skipped about three chapters simply because we were not interested..."
5,Best Disney Movie Ever!,"I loved this movie as a child and it still holds my interest today. Its a wonderful masterpiece of music and animation. I am disappointed its not the actual ""uncut"" movie (see other reviewers reviews), but its still a great movie."
5,Fantasia means fantasy,"When I first got it for Christmas in 1991, I found it boring, and I couldn't keep concentrated on it. That was when I was three. Now I'm twelve, I get it. It is a bit like The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh or Make Mine Music, made up of tiny stories told with animation and music. My favourite part is the dancing mushrooms and thistles. Not so much for younger ones, but if you are nine or above, it's perfect."
4,Good read,"Not for the faint of heart, but rewards the effort you put into it. Highly recommended by a big fan of calvino"
5,Wonderful concept and execution,"A delightful collection of Vignette's. The set up is wonderfully original, the narrator Qwfq is at turns humorous and poignant. Calvino moves between things both epic and intimate in scope with an ease that few authors possess. The end of the last section is particularly powerful."
5,Of fairy dust and cosmic equations,"Amazing, and though it's hard to write a cliche like this after reading something so incredibly original, it truly is unlike anything else you'll ever read. Calvino uses higher math elements as his characters and the construction of the universe and probably the destruction of time as his story line. Like the best of carnival rides, who knows what the heck's going on? But the ride is fantastic and just exists in its own space. Have fun with this-- but be careful: you might get lost at the outer/inner rim of creation."
3,Some funny and some ...tedious,"The idea of entities as old as the universe telling their stories from their perspective - some at the galaxies macro scale and some at the atoms micro scale - seems like an interesting idea.Italo Calvino has portrayed some stories with a style and prose that actually makes it a pleasurable reading experience. Unfortunately some of the stories are tedious and tiresome.Overall - it deserves 3 stars for the idea, for being short- overall and for some of the stories which are truly fascinating."
5,I've lent it to all my friends,"and it's getting so worn I might have to buy a new copy. ""Cosmicomics"" is a charming book that fascinates English majors and physics majors alike - not many books can do that. The elegance and strength of Calvino's writing never fails to astound me."
4,kid lit,"I really liked this book, not because it only took 2 days to read such a short collection of pages, but because it was like reading a child's book about the creation of the universe. Calvino is so very creative, I can't help but wonder if he was stoned when he thought of this idea...Non, non, ce n'est pas possible. Read it if you yourself are creative and looking for something fun to read. If you are overly serious and melancholic, then do not bother."
1,Buyer Beware,"Ordered two Studio Series 52-inch five blade fans with four medium-base 60-watt light sockets. Was very disappointed to find that shipped items came with tiny light sockets that take only candelabra-type light bulbs, available with no more than 40 watts each. So instead of 240 watts of light the item affords a maximum of 160 watts. One of the ceiling fans was already installed at considerable expense before I discovered this fault, so I'm keeping it. I'm returning the other one."
5,Quiet and cool,"I believe this product is being discontinued, so the price was wonderful for a full-size, very nice fan. In fact, I ordered a second one for another room. The only change I would make would be having the medium speed a bit slower."
5,Innovative programming,"This innovative programme works. If more CDs can provide new perspectives to modern and classic canon through such careful (though risky) programming, the Internet will not be so much of a threat to the industry. Much we can learn from Hélène Grimaud.Grimaud's Beethoven is powerful, and Avon Part's finale is a joy. Some may not like his allusion to Bach, but I find it refreshing of the greatest moments of Bach, Charles Ives, as well as Part himself."
3,Staright Trippin,"Yo yo yo. Dis cd was straight trippin doe. Its was aight at first, i was listenin to it wit my homies and they was like ""Why are you hangin out with us you don't even know us, and wus up with the non-ghetto music this is our hood (I live in the d)and we only listen to rap"". So I was like tru dat and walked out... in conclusion violense solves nutin."
1,Not Worth the Cost,The previous review got it right -- this book is a cheesy attempt to get people to part with their money for what is essentially the Solaris man pages bound with a nice cover. There is no added value whatsoever.I returned my copy for a refund after realizing what this really was.
3,ANIMAL SCRUBBER HOSE ATTACHMENT,"NO SUPRISES. AS ADVERTISED, A LITTLE LESS QUALITY THAN EXPECTED IN THAT THE HOSE CONNECTION DOES NOT SWIVEL MAKING MANUEVERING SOMEWHAT CUMBERSOME, BUT, IT DOES WORK FOR LARGE ANIMALS AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT."
4,Michael Keaton is WONDERFUL,"Michael Keaton is the only reason to watch this movie and he is a GOOD reason. As one reviewer said ""You will laugh in spite of yourself"" Let go and let yourself laugh. Let the inner child out as #3 would say. Michael Keaton is just a wonderful versatile actor and so sadly under-rated.I LOVE his portrayal of clone #3. #2 was fabulous as well. Just PRICELESS! The restaurant scene is HILARIOUS.Unfortunately Andie McDowell is her same blah bland self. That woman has no spark and really takes away from the film. IGNORE her!I highly recommend DREAM TEAM with Keaton. It is funny and original.I repeat. Keaton is a wonderful actor!"
3,Great premise. Keaton looks like he really had fun.,"This is a very funny movie, and I liked it a lot more than most of the reviews about it did. I liked how the clones were different parts of his personality, as one is a burping, smoking, slob, but a workaholic, and the other is his almost feminine side. He seemed to really have a blast as #4 (a clone of a clone), which is a role that Jim Carrey would probably have been too embaressed to play. The only real down is it's length. Two hours for such a simple plot. I really enjoyed Groundhog Day (a movie not to different to this) and I found that to be a bit too long, and that was twenty minutes shorter. Otherwise, thoroughly entertaining."
1,Make sure and scroll down the page,This DVD will NOT work on players sold in the USA. It is coded for Region 2 and was only in the small print. Should have been larger or brought to attention considering it is shipped FROM North Carolina !!!! Returning product :(
1,DON'T BUY IF IN UNITED STATES!!!,You can not watch these as they are the wrong region. I highly suggest buying local NOT ONLINE for movie purchases!!!!
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,"The Painted Bird is a brutal, beautiful masterpiece. Kosinki's poetic words paint an incredibly vivid portrait in the minds of its readers that is truly indelible. I feel privileged to be one who has read it."
1,Fraud - fantasy passed off as history,"This book is mostly lies, and I don't mean the subtle kind common in such works - I mean flat out fabrications and inventions. It isn't worth a real review. For G-d's sake, if you must read it, check it out from a library or buy it used.If you don't believe me, check around, that's what Google is for.This fraud, Kosinsky, defames all those who suffered in WWII with his shameless gold-digging."
5,"One-of-a-kind man, one-of-a-kind book","Should you want to go out of this world, you have two options. Kosinski is your second! A more realistic one (than into fantasy worlds) in that you can not believe these things he is writing about is likely to occur on the very same planet you now are on.Shame it's true! For this piece, it's the Europe in WWII. See his others if you like the thing come closer, closer, closer to your homeland, the US."
5,Disturbing but powerful,"I have to tell you that this is a very disturbing novel, but let's not forget that it is recounting a very disturbing and horrific period of humankind (the mass extermination of Europe's Jews) so actually, the subject is to blame. This is one of the most underrated and powerful novels that I have ever read, and it will surely leave its mark on you. The book will take you to the depths of hell - which are, I discovered, indeed of human origin - and give you a renewed appreciation for life and the inate freedoms and liberties which we all need to vigilantly protect.Please note however that this novel may not be appropriate for very young adults or immature readers."
5,An excellent read,Betsy Kosinski is a fabulous writer who weaves this tale of a boy so tortured (simply due to his looks) you can truly begin to understand the origin of hatred. This is a must read but only for those over 21 due to the violence and bestiality as well as the rape. Touching and gripping I couldn't put it down. Excuse me now while I order more Kosinski.
3,disappointed,I like his writing style a lot... so its a shame that I had to skip over so much of this book because I found it to be tasteless and callous. Too much sexual content for me.Definitely not for kids or high minded adults.
5,Uncomfortably real,"I'm surprised by any negative reviews of this WWII, quasi-Holocaust tale of a young Jewish boy wandering on his own during the war.The story is indeed rather ""creepy"". It's not a ""feel good"" read. It's also well told and beautifully written. The sexual, brutal, and homicidal aspects were, I thought, handled rather delicately yet without losing the intended hard-punch impact. Certainly some tough topics, but nothing gratuitous here.It's very thinly veiled that this is (tragically) an autobiographical novel. An important work in this genre', and again, very well written. Probably not for the extremely timid, but if you can handle frank truth, don't let the hand-wringers scare you away from reading this one."
3,Actually a 5-star review,"But who in their right mind would give five stars to a story about: bestiality, torture, incest, rape, murder, butchery, rape ... (I know I said 'rape' twice - it could be a dozen times). Have I left anything out? Probably. You get the picture. Read this book at your peril. You will never be able to forget it...."
2,Another deceived reader,"I guess I'm another deceived reader who thought The Painted Bird was autobiographical. It is true that if despicable events really, truly occurred, we are willing to deal with them as readers because we feel great sympathy for the victim and we know he or she is just recording graphically experienced atrocities. However, if we learn the same stuff is fiction we recoil, betrayed and angry at the author for dreaming up such totally sick and perverse scenarios.I did think the author writes powerfully and tells his story dispassionately as would a boy paralyzed and shell-shocked by the evil that men do. But knowing this is not only fiction but racist propaganda against the Poles, suddenly Kosinski loses his appeal and becomes just another author seeking fame by whatever means necessary."
1,"I don't believe in book burning, but ...","... if I did, this book might top my list. I made it past the story of the man spooning out another man's eyes and stepping on them, but when I got to the woman having a bottle of poop shoved up her and being kicked until it broke and then kicked some more -- that's when I gave up. This is the most disgustingly graphic book I've ever seen, and it's not as if it had a plot to make up for it. The whole point of the book (to where I read) seemed to be to shock the reader with wretched depictions. No thanks..."
1,Plot-less violence,"Maybe it would help if I weren't a sophmore reading this for history class. I have never enjoyed manditory reading. Then again, maybe not. This book had no plot. Almot every chapter had the young boy in a different situation, the author seems to have wanted to show as many horrible situations as possible. The violence, even if it was true to the time period, was incredibly graphic and drawn out. I get nauseous whenever my thoughts accidently flip to the eyeball scene. Besides, every young boy I know would have fainted dead away if he saw what the boy saw. I don't know, nor do I much care, if Kosinski made up every single word (it's a novel: historical FICTION). But for anyone who dislikes being made to feel sick and enjoys a plot should stay far away from this book."
2,Of Questionable Historical Value,"Although Kosinski did not write this work as history, American readers are liable to accept its claims as gospel truth. It is unfortunate that Kosinski invents events which never happened. For instance, his claim that Jews hiding in swampy areas were attacked by local Poles is flatly contradicted by eyewitnesses, and there are other non-factualities in this text as well. Considering especially the fact that Kosinski owes his very life to Poles who sheltered him from the Germans, it is thus particularly sad that he would write such ugly untruths about the Polish people. The Holocaust was cruel enough without the embellishments which Kosinski depicts in his book."
3,Graphic,It was a hard book to read because it was very graphic. I'm not sure if at the end of the book I really liked it. I felt the author wrote about a boy observing a bunch of pedofiler villegers and I can't believe everyone there was like that. It got into some pretty sick stuff such as sex with animals. Really graphic violence and torture. Be warned the book will make you ill.
1,Perverted,"I'm sorry I wasted the money. I can see by the reviews you either love it or hate it. I'm not squeamish by nature, but this book is one continuous torture fest which not only targets human victims, but animals as well. Three quarter's way through, when I realized this indeed was the premise from beginning to end, I started skipping these parts (which got me to the last page quite quickly). I was bored and disgusted with the author. I believe he had a sick fetish and lived them out through these pages. In the end my eyeballs got six-pack abs from rollng around so much. This book is going on my ""Do Not Lend"" shelf as I value my friends and wouldn't consider them subjecting them to such gory nonsense."
1,SICK SICK SICK,I can only say that this man must have been very sick in his mind to write this and suicide did us all a favour. He has made the Poles out to be as sick as himself and its all lies. How dare this book be taken seriously? If it is fiction then his detailed descriptions are something in his mind which are really perverse and dangerous. The Poles suffered as much as anyone and for them to be portrayed in this way is insulting and I am ashamed to see the well known and up til now respected so called intellectuals' praise of this work. i wanted to burn the book but its from the library. A health warning should be put on the front. If those sort of things did go on I would assume they were rarities rather than the norm as he makes out to be. The more scary thing for me would be that I was the only one who detested this book but I am not alone. Arthur Millar and his ilk have gone down in my estimation.
3,This is the adventures of a gypsy boy in war torn europe.,"I found certain parts of this book offensive and just plain out nasty. It was, however, a worth while read. Please let me know what you thought."
4,Very good,"The violence of ""The Painted Bird"" would be shrieking and possibly unbearable were it not fixed in Kosinski's detached, ice-cold prose. The narrator - a simple, bewildered child - tells of his misadventures as he is kicked around between Eastern European villages during World War II. He sees and is subject to much cruelty and although he lacks the complicated sensibilities to intellectually process his surroundings, this nameless Gypsy clearly is becoming more and more damaged through his difficult travels. A startlingly dark tale."
4,Spectacular...and more...,"I had this book on my old list of college fiction, which i'm re-reading again before i turn 50. It's an incredible book, one of the best i've ever read (in my personal 'Top 10'). I'm shocked at so many bad reviews, and bad reviews of the author - per se. As far as a well-written book, it's incredible. You feel as if you ARE the boy, traveling thru the villages. All of your senses come to life, and you live as he lives. That - to me - makes for a spectacular book, AND writer. Not whether there are some graphic parts in it or not. And YES - there are - so i 'only' gave it 4 stars because of parts that may bother sensitive people, including myself. But as a piece of art, it's totally amazing. A part of literary history that i'm very glad i read again, and experienced. A masterpiece."
2,bored...,"I am giving this two stars because I did enjoy and was gripped by the first half of the book, and regardless of the apparent fradulent actions on the part of the author, I thought that the pain, torture, and punishments that the ""unnamed boy"" endured were meant to be allegorical of the experiences that the Jews went through in the concentration camps. In fact, I did not know about the author and the claims of fraud until after I finished reading the book and looked everything up on wiki. But fraud or no fraud and allegories aside, I became pretty bored with the second half of the book, mostly because I got tired of just going from one torture scene to the next. Indeed, the book is powerful in it's descriptions, but I really had to push myself to finish the second 100 pages..."
2,KEEP AWAY!,This book is terrible! It is wrought with errors and is not a wise pick for a textbook. I've checked out the 7 pages of errata that are related to this book and still find major errors that they have overlooked. This book looks like some hack of a professor threw together some half-@$$ed notes.
2,Film quality problems,"I found the sound very low and I could not hear it even increasing the volume all the way to the top.The colors are kind of faded, not up to normal standards.What can be done about these items?"
1,Not worth the money,I tried making fruit leathers (blackberry and apple) with these trays. The leathers stuck so badly they came off in tiny pieces instead of sheets. One tray cracked while I was trying to remove the dried leather. I only had 2 leather trays (which came with my dehydrator); the rest of the batch I did on microwave safe plastic wrap. The ones on plastic wrap dried considerably faster and didn't stick. So don't bother with the leather trays- just use plastic wrap.
2,So dissapointed,These worked awesome for me!! But I am only on my second season using them and they are all brittle and cracked up. I was very careful with them too. I wish I could find a sturdier replacement.
5,hi vite,give my little ones the important vites they lack from not eating right...finicky little ones...would recommend for any pet.
3,Buddy X 99,"This CD is interesting, but it does not have the punch that her earlier work had. The refrain stays with you!"
4,Better than you might think,"I watched this movie because Josh Holloway is in it. I really didn't expect much from it, although I've seen other ""B"" movies Josh was in, and his acting is what redeems the movie. But I have to say, this one was pretty darn good! Better than expected with a surprising ending which I will not give away, but I will tell you this much: The review by Ang Poon Kah is inaccurate. Please don't watch the movie expecting it to end the way she says. Definitely worth having for any Josh Holloway fan."
3,Hot Guy But Cold Plot,"Josh Holloway is smoking in this film done before he made a splash in the hit series Lost. But the plot to this movie is predictable and not exectued well. The love scene between Josh and Nastasia Kinski (or her body double) is very hot, and the acting is good on all accounts. It's worth a look if you like any of the stars in it."
3,Kinski is sexy when aged,"its about Kinski whos married and a buisnesswoman to Jeff Fahey([*** of a ***]in this movie). Kinski sorta has her fling with Josh Holloway and he wont leave her alone, when Holloway stares dead on its creepy, man he is creepy. highlights would be Kinski's nude scenes defenitly, ohh my godess"
5,Outstanding!,"You never know what you don't know. An incredible storehouse of information. Must have if you build ship models, but please don't ask to borrow this book from me!"
3,"Not bad. Not amazing, but not bad.","I never read a sidney sheldon book before so I cant really compare it to his other works. The book is not brilliant, but what I can say is that I chose to read it as a book report and I enjoyed reading it very much."
1,Good as an adventure story for boyscouts,"Anyone who is remotely familiar with the works of Forsyth, Clancy, Deighton, le Carre (I do recognize this is a quite diverse bunch) will immediately dismiss this novel.The story is so predictable. The details essential for a political thriller is completely missing. The phrases are corny."
5,SIDNEY SHELDON'S BEST TO DATE!,"ANOTHER SIDNEY SHELDON-CAN'T-PUT-DOWN READ!THIS IS THE BEST BOOK BY SIDNEY SHELDON.USUALLY, HIS BOOKS ARE THE SAME OLD STORIES. THE MAIN CHARACTER WILL B BELOW THE POVERTY LINE AND IN A GIFFY THEY BECOME RICH, FAMOUS, SUCESSFUL AND WHAT NOT.......BOOKS LIKE RAGE OF ANGELS, STARS SHINE DOWN, NOTHING LASTS FOREVER, NAKED FACE, STRANGER IN THE MIRROR, TELL ME YOUR DREAMSAND BLOODLINE WERE MORE OR LESS THE SAME. O-K-A-Y.IF YOU HAVE TIME TO WASTE, THEN U CAN READ THESE.........BUT, TO GIVE THE DEVIL HIS DUE, HIS OTHER BOOKS LIKE.......MEMORIES OF MIDNIGHT, THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT, SANDS OF TIME, WINDMILLS OF THE GODS, DOOMSDAY CONSPIRACY, BEST LAID PLANS AND THE OTHER REST WERE JUST E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AMONG ALL, WINDMILLS OF THE GODS IS THE BEST.TERRIFIC, PULSE-RACING EXCITEMENT....IF YOU HAVE NEVER BEFORE READ A NOVEL BY SIDNEY SHELDON, WINDMILLS OF THE GODS IS A PERFECT BOOK TO START WITH."
2,Too Easy Plots with Disappointing Ending,"I've read this as if to read a comic of some kind, it was fun enough and that was all. Character developments are poor and the twist and shakes that go along with the story line are somewhat predictable, both of which make reading this book a vindication for your guess work, not a productive experience. Skip if you don't have rich amount of time just to be killed."
2,Props are the only thing holding it together. Forget plot!,"As far as US ambassadors go good. Mary's side if you have to pick a side is good. Apart from that , everything else is rubbish."
3,What if Ed Wood were making movies today?,"This no budget American re-make of ""The Professional"" is hysterically (unintentionally?) funny. Pointless flashbacks of scenes we just saw, actors improperly miked, bad lighting, over the top performances, stock explosions from other films, may very well make this the modern day ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". If you love bad film, this is a must own masterpiece."
2,Scott Baio Fans,"Scott Baio is playing a ""tuff guy"" role, which of course is very different from the fun, light hearted charecters we are used to seeing him play, whom is trying to rid him self of a past he regrets. He has a ""dream"" for which he will do whatever it takes to acheive, even if it means continuing to face a past he is running from. For those Scott Baio fans-it's not his best acting, but the ""rugged"" look looks good on him. I enjoyed the film simply because of being a fan of his. Others would view the film as being generic. It's definatly a ""B"" movie."
4,Cute,"I am an adult who loves reading teen books.This one is good. The story of a young british girl who goes to New York for the summer. She gets the surprise of her life when she gets there.While this book is not a hard hitting one (no drugs, sex, etc.) it is written with lots of humour and explores what happens when we have pre-conceived ideas of a person just by looking at their surroundings.Sophie ends up learning some valuable lessons which, thanks to the authors, wonderful writing never makes us feel as though we have to preached to.This book is a nice entry into the teen books. Buy it."
3,too heavy and large,"My husband and I have been looking for a new set of dishes for awhile. We thought we had finally found the answer with this set. Unfortunately we struck out again. The pieces are very attractive, but they are too heavy and large."
4,Square Corelle,Love the lite weight and semi-transparency of the glass material. Wish the cups were also the same material instead of earthenware but the size is great. Look great on the table with clean lines and interesting patterns.
4,My Square Round Corelle Dinnerware,I like my new dinnerware very much the square makes it different.
4,"Good design and usability, but not representative...","This set of plates are very beautiful and resistent (non-scratch, etc.). The only issue is that they are VERY light !! therefore, they seem cheap. it is only a matter of impressions. If you are very practical, these are made for you. If you care about the nobility of materials, then keep looking..."
4,really loved these plates,"I really loved these plates when I saw them in store, that I bought 2 sets. Since I've started using them, you can see small scratch marks in the plates. And as another has stated, there are a few (minor) defects in the paint."
2,Plates were mis-shaped and black lines were faded,"I bought this set to match the set I already had and wasn't too happy with the way it was made in comparison to the set I already had for 4+ years. The ""new"" set's bowls, cups, and plates were all slightly mis-shaped and the black lines weren't colored in all the way (looked faded). Overall I wouldn't order these again."
2,correlle dinnerware,"Corelle Square 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4, Simple LinesIt is very nice,but the lines are fading off after few washes in dishwasher. surprised. recommend, pain white. anyhow who knows the paint does not contain lead?"
5,Received as a Christmas gift and love them!!!!,This is the greatest set of dishes ever! Love the square plates and bowls!!!! They are light for even the kids to handle and the black and white match perfect in our kitchen! I have all ready ordered another set so I now have service for 8!
4,Looks great,It looks great. I only docked one star because I found other similar designs in Corelle that look just as good and cost significantly lesser than this one.Amazon did a great job with the packaging considering that it is a heavy item.
4,Love them,"I've had these for almost a yer now. They are great, they haven't broke or cracked. Believe it or not my daughter decided to toss a plate on the floor today, nothing happened to the plate thank goodness. Also wonderful in the dishwasher, the pattern is just the same as when I took it outed the box."
4,Great Dinnerware Set for the price,"This dinnerware set really is great. The quality is impressive; despite multiple drops, these plates and bowls haven't chipped or cracked. The shipment arrived on time though the set itself was very dirty. I presume the layer of dust on them was because the item had been sitting around in their warehouse but after a quick cycle in the dishwasher, they came out sparkly clean. Overall, great product with a nice contemporary look."
2,Corelle Simple Lines dishware,"Poor workmanship leaves the painted lines partially faded, & in some cases even interrupted in pattern. These dishes were returned. It's a shame that quality is so poor!!"
5,Very Beautiful ...those mugs are simply perfect...,"Bought just a few months back. its very nice . using it regularly since then. those mugs are just perfect..the size, shape ,material n feel ( its better than the other corelle set -Urban Red i have).The only disappointment was that the lines on the plates are not that dark as these mugs. they are slightly light...but still, the whole set is very beautiful."
3,If you can get them in one piece....they're worth it!,"I received this order broken. They are not packed to be shipped. I replaced them from a local store and the dishes are GREAT! NOTE: For those of you who have a small microwave, the large square dishes may not turn on the carousel because of their size and shape. The smaller plates in the set are almost big enough to be dinner plates themselves. They're durable and dependable like all Corelle dinnerware. Altogether a great set of dishes if you can get them in one piece."
3,A little disappointed,"While I just got this dinnerware and can't attest to its durability yet, right off the bat I was disappointed with the color quality of the lines. Straight from the box the color in the lines looked like it was fading in spots - I expected it to be a rich, bold black as it looks in the photographs. I was also disappointed (I obviously didn't look hard enough at the photo before I bought) that the bowls have no design on them. Lastly, I would get more use out of the smaller plates if they were smaller (for dessert, a side dish or a snack), as they are now the smaller plates are nearly as big as the larger plates and I don't find that to be useful.**Update - the lines on the plates are also being scratched by silverware. Obviously not a quality process to put the decoration on the plates. Disappointed - expected more from Corelle."
5,Stylish and Durable Dishes,"This is the coolest set of dishes I've ever owned! They are lightweight but durable, and very stylish. I get compliments on them all the time, and most people can't believe they are Corelle! The square shape and modern design make them fun, and the strength of Corelle make them timeless. They seem a little light, but once you start washing them you realize that weight doesn't matter-- these babies hold up strong. The dinner plates are REALLY big and we end up only using the lunch plates. Instead of buying two 16-piece sets, I bought one set and then just bought individual lunch plates and bowls to add to the collection because I didn't want any more of the dinner plates. You really can't go wrong with this set, as long as they fit your style!"
4,"So far really like them, affraid black will chip","So far love them -- they look great, don't break and can be put in the oven, that said I've only owned them a little over a month and I'm already afraid I see a bit of the black lining chipping off the plates, we'll see. It's Corelle, they usually make good stuff."
3,Color faded,The patterns faded radically after one visit to the dishwasher. I wish the design would have been more durable. I would buy the solid white plates instead.
4,Good price,Let me tell you this was the fastest shipping and the best service I have ever had The dishes were in perfect shape and wrapped very wellThanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Pretty and functional,"We started out with two sets, but used them so much, we had to get a third. We mostly use the salad plates for dinner, as they are more than big enough. The bowls and mugs are a very good size. We also have the ramekins, which are perfect for snacking. Plus everything looks so nice on them."
4,Cute,"For the most part I'm satisfied. The dishes are cute. My only complaint is that the coffee cups were an off-white, not white like the rest of the set. They do the job, so that's all that matters."
2,Disappointed,"I was dead set in getting another Corelle dinnerware set to replace my current Corelle design. I dislike the weight and bulk of stoneware and like their lightweight materials. I was looking for something with a square shape and contemporary design, so these seemed to be everything I wanted. When I opened the box, I was disheartened to see that the printed design is very poor in quality. As other reviewers have mentioned on other Corelle products, it's pixelated and faded - not a true black. I will be returning these and continuing on my quest for the perfect inexpensive dinnerware set."
3,Nearly great,"As always Corelle produce a great product. The plates and bowls are excellent. I would wonder, however, why someone in product development and quality control did not notice that the cups are a totally different color, not as they appear on the product description. I mean they are not a little bit different in shade, they are way off. With glaze technology I am sure, if just a little effort was made, this collection of individual items could truly be called a ""set"". At this time, a re-think is needed."
5,Great set!,"I also grew up on Corelle dishes. I got some Corelle dishes for my wedding in 1994 and not one dish or bowl broke! I did give them up to a relative who needed dishes in 2002. I figured I would purchase a new set. A friend gave me some Mikasa, so I used those until now. When one broke, I decided to purchase a new set, well, actually 2, of the Simple Lines set by Corelle. My kids are afraid that they will break these because they seem so fragile. I told them not to worry--Corelle is very sturdy! I was hesitant about buying them online due to shipping, but took a chance. I received them earlier than expected, and upon opening the boxes, what a wonderful surprise to see that not one piece was broken! (From reading some reviews, I had expected the mugs to break.) We love these dishes too. Great simple, yet elegant design. IF I have to purchase another set of dishes in the future, I will stick with Corelle!"
5,Lovely set,"I love this dinnerware set and so does everyone that sees it. It's elegant-looking, lightweight, sturdy and beautiful."
5,"Corelle Simple Lines Square 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4","Esta vajilla es muy buena, recomendada. Ligera y de bonitos diseños. Estaba bien embalada y en buenas condiciones, la recomiendo muchisimo. muchas gracias"
3,Not good enough,"After reading numerous reviews of this product, i decided to take my chances and order this set... Unfortunately i was NOT impressed :( i love the design on the plates but the dinnerware is far too thin and lightweight, which to me equates to poor quality and something better fit for elderly people with no muscle strength that can barely pick up a plate to begin with....lol....so if you want lightweight, ordinary dishes, these are for you...If you want something more striking, fashionable, and sturdy, keep searching. Too much of a hassle for me to return but these will not be used as much as i would have liked. :("
5,Another great purchase on Amazon!,The amazon seller shipped the item pretty quickly and the actual plates looked exactly as described! Only thing I did notice that I didn't like was that the corelle sign on the bottom of the some of the plates was not centered. Other than that I'm extremely happy with them!
1,dishes were greasy !,"upon opening (the plain cardboard box) - the dishes were greasy - (as if used) - additionally the set of dishware was not in a Corelle factory box - if purchased in a store, most certainly the dishes would come in a Corelle factory box --there is no Corelle identification anywhere in the box -"
4,Worried about the lines,I love the look of these dishes on my square black bistro table but I'm worried about the lines fading. The lines are not a solid clean black. When you look close they are a grey checkered pattern forming the lines with darker areas in some places. I got an amazing deal for these on black Friday so I won't be returning them but I hope the lines hold up over time of use and the dishwasher
5,I am very happy with this set,The mugs are more substantial than earlier Corelle sets I had. They feel very good in the hand with the morning coffee. I love how well the plates and bowls stack -- so they take less space in the cupboard than the other set of dishes I have. They are modern and the fact that so much is white is good for displaying the food.
4,Upturned Edges,"I bought this set for the design, but I ended up liking it more for the overall shape of the plates. The plates (especially the smaller plates) have ""upturned"" edges, making it function more like a bowl. This is a great feature for kids who seems to have issues keeping their food on their plates while pushing it around! Also a benefit if you are eating something a little ""juicy."""
4,Nice dish set,"This set is not bad considering that it is chip resistant, compact, and service for 4. I have bought other non Corelle sets only to have them break or chip just trying to wash them. I do have to warn buyers that they are thin which makes them heat up and transfer that heat to whatever surface you set them on. I would suggest protecting your table with a place mat. Also since they are so thin and compact they are somewhat hard to hold on to when washing. They become very slick when wet and sudsy."
3,"Beautiful and perfect for casual dinning, but not if serving hot meals...","PROS:Light weight, stylish, simply but attractively appealing, good size bowls, coffee cups are comfortable to hold. Overall, it does serve the purpose for most part and is reasonably priced.CONS:The plates and bowls transfer the heat very easily making it hot to handle."
3,looks good but not complete set,We got the product of 16 pieces but 4 of the cups are with faded color and of made in China. We returned the product and talked with customer service and they promised to send a new set. Once we received the new set it's the same story again. So we totally returned and went for a new dinner set altogether.If you are lucky and got the complete set then this looks a worth product.
5,Simply The Best Corelle Dishes!,"5 Stars! I wish I could give it more...PRO's:Prices here on Amazon.com, better than anywhere else.Shipping was not a problem dishes arrived perfect!Light weight, stylish & stacks well.I love the size of the smaller dinner plate,Can be used as decorate serving dishes.Food looks best displayed on these dishes.Table setting looks so pretty!CON's:None* Looking to buy another set soon!"
5,Perfect,Just what I wanted to replace a corelle set I bought over 10 years ago. Ended up getting two more sets! Looks great!
4,"nice, needs pockets","This is a great day bag. You can fit a bunch of stuff in it. On the downside there is only one big zippered pocket and a laptop zippered pocket, but not really anything else. However, the shoulder strap is heavily padded and doesn't cut in and is plenty long enough. All-in-all its a good bag."
5,Love it!,I use it with the High Sierra Deuce Backpack and they make such a great and useful set. The design is nice also the material. I'm pretty pleased!
3,Unusual variant of NECROMANCY,"ROSEMARY'S DICIPLES is an oddball video. It contains a variant of NECROMANCY ( 1972 ) which was the original PG release version of the film.Additional scenes were shot and inserted into the film and it was re issued as THE WITCHING and re rated R.NECROMANCY has never been released to home video, while THE WITCHING is all over the place. ROSEMARY""S DISCIPLES is extremely unusual as it uses an TV edited print of THE WITCHING ( removing all nudity and also deleting some language ) for the bulk of the presentation, and then features the original ending from NECROMANCY ( quite different from THE WITCHING's ending )."
4,Never out of style!,"I am certain that many, if not most, would consider this movie too ancient to be viable. I suppose I have enough ""kid"" left in me to find this movie enjoyable. I laughed out loud with my grand daughter recently as we watched it together.If younger children and ""kids of all ages"" have lost the ability to enjoy this classic, it is a genuine loss indeed! This is wonderful entertainment for the entire family. (:-)"
2,Letterbox only,"Hey, Disney. Don't know if you read customer reviews at Amazon, but you should and probably do. What's the deal with full screen? This is a DVD, for heaven's sake. Archivable. I ain't gonna buy any full-screen releases, and I know thousands won't, either. This movie's a classic; you don't treat classics like some kiddie junk. Fine for rental, but nix buying."
4,Disney's That Darn Cat,Great family entertainment. Suitable for all ages. Dean Jones is very funny and makes you want to see other fills with him in it.
3,"Funny, adorable",This is so cute having the cat help solve the crime!! Hayley Mills is a wonderful actress.
3,Cynical,"I have my VHS copy right here. I should just dump it to SVCD since, judging by Disney's track record in new media, is all they will do for their release. (sigh)"
4,a silly but fun family movie,"A young woman's (Hayley Mills) cat DC becomes involved in a kidnapping and robbery case. Patty (Hayley) finds a wristwatch around DC's neck in place of his collar, and becomes convinced that the faint scratching on the back of it spell out the beginning of ""HELP!"". She decides this is a case for the FBI, starting a hilarious investigation revolving around the habits of the cat. Children are sure to love this silly, funny movie, and Hayley Mills fans will delight in seeing Hayley Mills as she concocts an outrageous plan on nothing more than a hunch."
5,Classic Hayley Mills film,"This DVD version of the movie looks great and is very enjoyable. Hayley Mills is her usual irrepressible self, and the supporting cast is top notch. The feline actor in particular! ;)I don't quite understand the anger from some other reviewers about the fullscreen format. It didn't bother me at all. Disappointment I could understand, but this kind of vitriol? It's still a very watchable and enjoyable film for all ages, and I found it a refreshing change from the dumbed-down ""kid's"" movies they tend to make these days. Adults will enjoy the suspenseful story, retro style, and feline antics just as much as kids will. I'd skip the remake and get the original."
5,Gorgeous!!!,"Absolutely fabulous! This movie can make you laugh 1000 times over! It's delicious. The actor's play is a masterpiece, something that is very rare in our days.The intrigue is perfectly balanced, and the storyscript is the work of a genius!If you want to laugh like you do when you were a child, this is your moment!"
5,Wonderful!,"That Darn Cat is one of Hayley Mills best movies it is a very funny movie and that cat is adorable! I highly recommend this movie, Besides Hayley Mills and the cat I also liked Dean Jones he was funny. I hope Disney puts this classic on DVD soon. Disney also released a remake in 1997 but I have no desire to see that movie and I will just stick with the classic 1965 movie!"
5,Classic Comedy,"I enjoyed this version of the movie much more than the one with Christina Ricci. Although this version is dated, it's fun to see the ""beach"" movie references and old fashion ethics. Hayley Mills is a delight."
1,Also disappointed,"I completely agree with the other reviewers here. I also was planning to purchase the dvd of That Darn Cat as it was one of my childhood favorites. However, it is available in full screen only. Why does Disney bother to put out dvds that are nothing but vhs copies on a disk? I guess I will wait until they get wise and put this in a wide-screen version on dvd."
3,Another Disney Pan & Scan DVD!,Well as a person who likes both dogs and cats and I have always liked movies about dogs and movies about cats so I absolutely loved the original That Darn Cat (1965) and I was waiting for years for a DVD to become available and now that the DVD is finally a reality I'm disappointed that it is just pan & scan and that they didn't even bother to go for a widescreen format. They could have very easily put out a seperate widescreen DVD as well as a pan & scan DVD or they could have had one DVD with widescreen on the A side of the disc and pan & scan on the B side.
4,That's Quite a Cat!,"Of course, the cat is the real star in this movie, even though Hayley Mills and Dean Jones are pretty good, too."
3,"It's cute, but .......","As another reviewer said, it's too short. I didn't even bother to watch the extra cartoon they tacked on. The beginning of the tape is loaded with annoying FOX commercials, but you can always speed by them as I did! If you want a cute, SHORT version of Cinderella, go ahead and get it. But, if you're looking for more, you may be disappointed.Nice drawing style though. The style of animation appears to be similar to Japanese Anime (Pretty, large eyes, particularly on Cinderella). I bought it mostly out of curiosity. And my curiosity has been adequately satisfied."
5,Declaration of excelence,"The illistrated book of ""The Declaration of Independence"" by Sam Fink is excelent. It makes it very memorable for people of all ages who can read. I recomend everybody who home schools, or all public libraries, have a copy. People need to understand what happened to create this country. It was not easy."
1,Self-absorbed,"The author portrays himself as a victim, apparently never stopping to reflect, or at least discuss in the book, how his actions and inaction have affected others, including his children, ex-wives, family, and friends. Much too much time spent on self-absorbed thoughts and ultimately, Mr. Campbell never seems to come out of the dark. Simply nothing new here."
2,Clamps all 4 too short to use,"I wanted to mention just that, mine came with 4 clamps all too short to use. Had to baby the car to parts store with it all unclamped to buy ones that would fit.For the price you would thin they would have fit. And the instructions are not great."
5,Great help for the Gluten-Free!,"I bought these when looking for ways to toast and grill - at home, work, and while traveling - without cross-contamination from other peoples' foods that might contain gluten. These racks are small enough to bring to work for the toaster oven, or pack in my suitcase. I bring them when I am going to a cookout for the grill, too. Very convenient."
1,Terrible!!,"It's this whole weird new-aggie thing. The instructor wears a turban. I'm normally quite open to new age concepts but for yoga I'd rather have something a bit more yoga and less ""dancing around in the forest pretending you're living back in the primitive age some 1,000s of years ago"". I don't really feel like I'm getting a real yoga work out session at all. Now pregnant with my second child and am looking to buy a different yoga DVD."
1,"Bought for my wife, we both thought this woman was from space","I was looking for a good exercise video for my wife on DVD, now that our tape player finally died. I picked this up, and we decided to do the first set together with our daughter, and mom is 4 months along with the new one. that was a huge mistake, this woman who does this i swear is an alien. She was so bizarre, and her viewpoint and philosophies on pregnancy was clearly new age california. No thanks, this was not a good workout video, unless you are into new age religion or cults."
5,Best for new moms,"Both workouts are super-helpful and easy to follow, no special equipment needed besides a towel. The post-natal workout is especially helpful to get ideas of how to relate with an infant, and my daughter really seemed to enjoy it then. She's now over a year old and still enjoys it when I help her do some of the ""baby yoga"" moves. I have to admit that I skipped the singing part and just did deep breaths then, but it still relaxed my mind and body and tightened my muscles--combining this with nursing helped me regain my shape, too."
1,worse yoga video i've ever tried,No way for me. I didn't like the chanting at all. I got a creepy feeling. Way too new-agey for me. Very low quality video too. Absolutely do not recommend....unless you are into chanting while you do yoga.
5,"""Party Like It's Eiffel 65""",Wow just bought it today for a party we were having tonight! Usually you have to keep an eye on the cd player cause everyone wants to be th DJ. Not tonight- the guys left it alone and this disc played 99% of the whole night. LOVE IT
5,THis cd is great,i didn't know about groups that start over seas but the song blue is the best party song! its the fist song on my millenium mix!
3,Blue is the best song,"To me, Blue is the best song on the CD. I'd like to hear what other tracks get airplay or if Eiffel 65 will be one hit wonders. The other songs have no distinction. You've heard Blue? You've heard the rest. Blue actually reminds me of Will Smith and his song for Fresh Prince of Bel Air. I also noticed a similarity on a couple of other songs to Depeche Mode. Overall, this CD is average."
1,One of the worst albums of are time,I tried to like this on so many levels but this just sucks.I tried to like this on a campy level but that didnt work beacuse there seems to be no passion here.This song comes in the long line of horrific one hit wonders The Macarena.
1,This was plain awful,I am missing something or am I just an ols foggy because this was one of the worst albums ever.If you wanna hear some really good dance music listen to elvis
3,Hmm...nothing...but not bad,"You know...this CD is about nothing. Well, so there are a few interesting ""somethings"" in it, but for the most part, that's it. The funny thing is that it sounds so cool, it's hard to tell. Now, if they had better lyrics, that would be better..."
3,Can you say Hyped?,"The CD is not that good as I thought it would be. Do not get me wrong, it isnt bad, but it can be a lot better. It is very light core techno."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CD!,"I wasted my money on this CD. I liked ""Blue"" for a while, but now, it's kinda annoying hearing the same song over and over, so I don't like it anymore. If you LOVE techo music (which i don't really) you might look into buying it, but if you're not into techno, don't buy it."
1,Europop? Eurotrash!,"Blahhh... Cliched little generic pieces with one or two catchy lyrics thrown in around largely pointless and grating vocal mush. You might relate to the video game references if you are 14 or so, and if you're lonely and sad enough to be turned on by innudendo-laden 'net references, and, heck, you've never listened to pointless blipping numskull-musak and want to try it out, then by all means give it a go. Personally, I am shocked that such a poor album has been flogged to Americans who don't know better while infintely more skilled acts are left unpromoted."
5,great music,"I heard ""blue"" on the radio and I just loved it. It really is great music. My son who is 4 loved the songs also, we danced for hours! This is a cd that everyone should own!"
4,"Eiffel 65 - Europop is ""Very Good""","Saw this CD at my local record exchange ... So I was like what the [heck] it's got ""Blue"" on it, (Which was and still is one of my absolute favorite songs, Thanks MP3!) so I bought it. On the drive home, ""Blue"" was first, (surprising...) then ""Too Much of Heaven"". Didn't like the song too much, so I put something else in. A month later I decided to listen to the whole thing. After listening to it, I found that is was a pretty good album! My mouth dropped when I heard ""Move your Body"" because I had heard it before and I didn't expect a ""no-name"" group like Eiffel 65 to do it. But they did. And they also did ""Another Race"" and ""Silicon World"". Would have been a 100% clean album, but they HAD to throw in a song about internet sex in ""Hyperlink"".Songs I rate ""Excellent"" (5/5 stars)BlueMove your BodySongs I rate ""Very Good"" (4/5 stars)Another RaceSilicon WorldEveything else on album: ""Good"" (3/5 stars)Worst song on album: ""Too Much of Heaven"" (Rating: Good)"
5,Eurotrash at its finest!!!,"Simply put, I love this CD. This is great ""going out"" music. I heard it for the first time when I was in Rome and immediately bought it. When I got back to the states, I found that ""Blue"" was a huge hit and was happily surprised.My favorites are--""Deep Down"", ""Move Your Body"", ""Blue"" and ""Too Much of Heaven"".A must buy!!"
2,What is this?,"To the people below,THIS IS NOT TECHNO MUSIC. While Blue had a certain novelty appeal,the rest of the CD is the exact same.It is not music with any heart,eg,Move Your Body,Move Your Body,Come on now everybody.The beat is`nt there either,its all the same.These guys should come up with some new material,as its all starting to sound too similar."
2,christanity,"I rated this cd ""2 stars"" only because of it's song ""blue"" and it's imense bass. I also gave this cd ""2 stars"" because of it blunt statements about christanity and how it puts down our only reason for living! ""Too much of heaven, can only bring you down"", is a quote from the song. When I heard this I was frankly, disgusted! I can only hope and pray there reason for this blantant remark... I really thougth that this band was really awesome till I heard the whole cd."
3,eiffel 65-europop,this cd is excellent.but do not buy this cd from this seller westendentertainment .this seller has shipped me only the first disc out of the 2 discs provided.other than taht the music is awesome
3,Some Fun,"Eiffel 65's one-hit-wonder effort with ""Blue"" prompted me to give the CD a go and see what else they were capable of. It has to be said that some of the songs are actually pretty catchy and just fun.""My Console"", (though a bit dated now with PS3 out), should appeal to any Playstation addict out there. Surprisingly, I though ""Blue"" was not the best song on the CD. ""Dub in Life"", ""Move Your Body"", and ""Another Race"" all sounded better to me. One of my personal favourites is ""Now Is Forever"", which is a bit slower than the others, but still pretty cool.On the balance of it, this is not a bad CD. It is not brilliance, but it is a fun and catchy collection of songs."
5,Eiffel 65::::Good Stuff,"I pulled this CD out of the back of my collection. I was in a techno kind of mood. Lots of people get into those kinds of mood. ANyways, this is a pretty cool cd! Now I realize why I bought it 5 years ago! Yes, it can be nerve racking after a while, and repetitive yes, but can you say GOOD BEAT MUSIC? Lots of people will say this is not music, but canned stuff, but I mean, it IS techno! I likedwas obsessed with this cd before, and I think It'll be on my desk for a while!"
4,"Bought it for the beats, love it for the lyrics.","At first listen, Eiffel 65's ""Europop"" is pretty much just that. It's great to listen to when your upset, or when you want to dance. It's catchy and happy. But there's so much more to ""Europop"" than bouncy synthesizers. I absolutely love the lyrics, especially to 'Too Much of Heaven', which talks about materialism, 'Your Clown', which is from the point of view of a guy who just found out his lover has been cheating on him, and 'Silicon World', which is just cute sarcasm about today's appearance-obsessed world. The hit 'Blue' talks about depression, 'Now is Forever' is a beautiful song about siezing the moment, and 'Dub In Life' is about taking shortcuts. Obviously there isn't too much depth to songs like 'Move Your Body', but all in all, ""Europop"" is brilliant social commentary wrapped up in catchy dance music."
2,It's all right,It is all right. Every one said it was da bomb but I don't think so. It is an ok cd. I you have not heard the songs listen to a sample and you might be the one who likes it!
5,This is the best,"This CD is really good. I first bought it because I couldn't get the ""Blue"" song out of my head. I thought I was going to be dissappointed by the rest of the tracks, but I wasn't. Song after song in this CD brings about different kinds of moods and you just can't help but to be happy, sing along and dance. This is a MUST BUY!"
5,AWESOME CD!,"I just went out and got this CD about 1hour ago. I was out looking for something that would sound good. But there really isn't anything, I was debating over Basement Jaxx, or some Techno junk, but there wasn't much. I came accross this CD and was like ""WHA? They released it already?"" I bought it because a radio station in Seattle plays new club stuff and had Blue. #1 song for the past month. If you're into dance, such as Vengaboys this has an awesome beat! But what makes it so cool is the ambient sound, it makes it seem futuristic. This easily fits into the dance / DJ / and Techno categories, especially Ambient! Eiffel 65 is here to stay, and they've made an impression on me!"
4,Scroll Up Please,"To the person who said that the singer is actually saying ""I will bleed I will die"", you are the misinformed one. This is a very common misinterpretation, but that is due to the lack of annunciation on the singers part. My uncle knows the group, and just look at the name of the song. Da ba Dee da ba....etc etc. I would appreciate you not spreading around information on the group until you have thoroughly researched, and not base it on your own ears. This is a good cd, but a little bit repetitive to all of the people out there."
4,"Good CD, look for more later on...",Hey to all who say this is techno...it isn't...it does use the techno beat and uses a lot of what is in techno music...it still isn't...what it really is is euro-pop...like it says on the title of the album...it comes very close..but this is what is heard over in europe all the time...i know...i got plenty of it there...most people who have said that this cd is not techno are right...but I still think this cd is a great one to listen to...groove to...and most of it is just plain fun...
2,gimme a break,Now this is just the dumbest cd I've ever heard the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because some of the lyrics are cool. This is NOT real techno. It is pure computer generated crap. If you wanna hear some real techno try some of these artists. Artists: Prodigy Fatboy Slim DJ Micro John Digweed Paul Cox Maybe you will then see the Truth
5,They should be named Eiffel#1,Eiffel 65 is the best CD I own. I like almost every song. You would have to be crazy not to like this CD. Blue(da ba dee) is the best song EVER. Go buy this CD right now.
2,Europop,Even thought there are some interesting musical ideas on this album - they ruin almost every song with nauseating canned drum machine beats and obnoxious overplayed synthesizer riffs.It sounds like a 2000 disco want-a-be.
1,Is this what pop culture is coming to?,"Techno, schmecno...who would dare to call this garbage ""music?"" The lyrics are boring, repetitive, and stupid, and these guys can NOT sing or dance. I believe that this is a group of guys with absolutely ZERO talent attempting to become a boy band. News Flash: we don't want to listen to annoying, mechanical voices! Not to mention their awful music videos...the cheesy computer animation is horrible. ""I'm blue, da ba dee da ba..."" Puh-leeze! This is a disgrace to the music industry. They should have called this album ""Europoop"" (I did not make a typo)! If ""europop"" is what you want, try S Club 7...NOT this garbage!"
3,"Eiffel 65 delivers, then disappoints","""Blue"" is a great song. I've heard it so many times and I still enjoy it, but the other songs on the album aren't as developed. Eiffel has a great ability to create a memorable and catchy refrain, but the rest of the song drags it down. The only real dance songs on the album are ""The Edge"" and ""Move Your Body"". The rest are okay, but the only thing you will remember is the refrain. If they work on developing the rest of the song, they will be sweet. Look for future albums!"
4,"one of my fav bands, but I still gotta say the truth!","See, the only reason Eiffel 65 Europop didn't get 5 stars, though they are one of my fav bands, is because the whole techno voice thing gets SLIGHTLY annoyed after awhile. I mean, there are some other cool songs beside DA BA DEE. Too much of heaven, Move your Body, My Console, and Europop are all pretty good. Even so, the sad realization that this CD might have been made off a couple of Casio products you can buy at Best Buy really stretches the line between originality and unoriginality. You began to not actually question the group's artistic merit, but rather question their ability as truly gifted people. All that aside, the bottom line is: if you LOVE da ba dee, buy one of the import singles, you'll end up liking the group alot better. IF you enjoy electronica music in general, you should pick up Europop."
1,All the songs sound the same,If you like Blue (Da ba DEE) are you in for a treat because all the there songs sound like that.You will be dissapointed if you were excpecting anything halfway decent
2,Insipid drivel for the simpleminded,"Sure I got Blue stuck in my head when I first heard it about a year ago. Even then I should have suspected a track whose main gimmick is repetition and a vocoder wasn't the product of creative genius.Unfortunately the customer reviews here are too polarized. Anyone who appreciates other techno music, or just good music in general will agree that Eiffel 65 is an exercise in mindless, uncreative silliness. But neither is it the unlistenable junk that others claim.It's more the kind of music you should pirate as MP3s, get out of your system in a day or two, and then erase forever. Maybe if you find a used CD, pop down a buck or two. Europop isn't worth much money, but it could be a fun quick listen."
5,Engaging!,"This album is addictive! It is great for driving around, putting it on in the background while you're doing something, or dancing at a party. The best songs are ""Blue"" and ""Move Your Body."" Although some people would not think so, Eiffel 65 is great at melodies and beats that get under your skin. Is it repetitive? Sure, and if you crave something less so then I don't think you were born to be a techno/electronia fan. However, for those who love this kind of music, go out and buy this album!"
4,"Really Good, only if you are Funky!!!","Just like the title, you need funk to love this CD!!!! If you HAVE a LOT of funk and grooviness, read on( cause you'll love this!)! I love ""Blue Da Ba Dee"", ""Dub in Life"", ""Move Your Body"", ""My Console"", ""Another Race"", "" Silicon World"", and ""Hyperlink"". I can't stand listening to ""Living in a Bubble"" and "" Now is Forever"". Still, it's a fantastic CD!!!!!"
4,Good baseball songs,"I could not find the song for the longest time that they played at the baseball games here in Idaho Falls at McDermott Field. The suspense was killing me!! Then I finally found out it was ""Blue"". I think that if there are plans for a Jock Jams 6, this song should be on it, as well as ""Move Your Body"". They played this song when a really cool ballplayer was at bat. Such memories!! I also like ""Dub in this Life"", mostly the chorus, I do not care for the parts such as ""Dollar bill in the pocket"" etc. A good CD overall"
5,Awesome CD!,"This CD is sooo cool. It's the best CD by any European band. I can't wait for a new ne for them. Too Much of Heaven is awesome, so is The Edge."
2,Buy the Blue single,"The only reason I bought this album was for the Blue song. All the other songs are not good. If you can, go for the single, its cheaper and you'll feel a lot better.(By the way, Blue is not that good of a song either, I personally don't care much for the cheezy vocals.)"
2,Don't listen to Eifel 65,"They are Satanists... Play, ""I'm Blue"" backwards to hear something surprising... The song in-fact says, ""Hide the body, eat the body""."
4,Get ya Dancin' Shoes On..,"Okay Honey,grab a beer,put on your dancing shoes and dance! This beaty techno CD will get anyone moving.Even those who don't normally listen to this style of music will give in to a bit of foot tapping and bum wiggling!Great to get a party going and excellent to dance to. The lyrics are different to the usual mindless waffle you can get on some techno stuff.I'm glad I bought this CD.Money well spent.Gets you in the mood...."
3,It Could Be a Lot Better,This CD is stranger then anything else I've heard. You never hear the singer's acual voice you only can hear the sythesizer. Of course some of the song are great. But its deffently not worth the money for a bunch of computers singing to you.
2,catchy only goes so far,"Many of the tracks have a great dance line to them, but beyond that ( which too gets repetitive ) the lyrics are incredibly loose, the content of the tracks is greatly lacking, and they depend too much on the voice synth to mask the obvious lack of lyrical attention. Still, a few of the tracks are high-energy and in spite of their difficulties, make for some enjoyable music."
5,Eiffel 65 RULES!!!,"I really like this band!I know that their lyrics are pretty silly but I still LOVE some of these songs!My favorites would have to be:My Console,Too Much Of Heaven,Move Your Body,Another Race,and Blue.I think this is a great cd!I would recommend this CD to all techno lovers!This may sound strange but this is the only band i like that makes techno music."
5,This CD Rocks!,"This is the ultimate dancing music! What attracted me was ""Blue"", I usually don't buy a CD for just ""1"" song. But I lucked out when I bought this one! I'm always looking for new music-(Dance, Electric, Techno), this CD will keep me entertained for months. This is the finest in Dance music! It just makes you want to get up and cut up the dancefloor! This is 100% High Energy! I definitely recommend it to all you DJ-Dance fanatics!"
3,"Blue (da ba dee), x 14","I wont say that if you've heard one song here, that you've heard them all, but each one follows the same formula. It's pretty much vocal effects, over synthesizer, over dance beats, repeat. But, the good news is that it's extremely catchy, and good in small doses. Some of the better tracks are ""Move Your Body"", ""Living In A Bubble"", ""Now Is Forever"", and my favorite ""Too Much Of Heaven"". Of course the big hit here ""Blue (da ba dee)"", has got to be one of the biggest guilty pleasures since ""Wannabe"". Overall, it's simple fun dancefloor bubblegum pop, that you'll love until you hate."
4,It grows,"Mixing the thoughts here... when I first heard the album, I thought it was a tad monotanous... especially with the songs playing in order... I felt the vocoder effects got grating and there wasn't much variety... I thought it was ""good for random in with 4 other discs"" but after listening a couple more times, it really started growing on me...One guy in these reviews mentioned that a ""great"" song is one you can love after 30 seconds... I disagree... those songs are the ones that you also eventually get sick of... the songs that grow on you, the ones that you keep finding new layers to, that is the true brilliance, and the test of a CD that might remain in your CD player for years to come...Is this that CD... I dunno yet, I haven't had the time to see if layers keep getting revealed to me... but I think there is that possibility...Give this a couple listens!"
5,THE BEST CD I OWN,"This is a great album. If you want to dance get this cd. Although it is repetitive I still like it because it makes the lyrics easy to memorize. I like the whole cd but my favorites are Blue (Da Ba Dee),Dub in Life,Move Your Body,Another Race,and Europop. I also like the special effects such as static and electric buzzing,magical dust in Dub in Life,and the sound of a flying saucer. This is the greatest album i've ever bought and I advise you to buy it to."
3,a cd you need to buy!,This cd is really cool! You need to buy it! Songs like Blue and Move Your Body are really cool! You'll want to start dancing or singing along when you here these songs! I hope you can enjoy this cd cause I know I do!
4,The New Euro Order,"E-pop has great dance rythm and yet has great ""sit back and listen"" sound. It balances Rock/Disco with a new order, electronic sort of twist. Enjoy!"
5,The bomb!,"This CD is very addictive. At first, it sounds a little strange, but it grows on you. I listened to it several dozen times within a few days of my purchase, and have been listening to it for the last few months. I just can't get tired of it! The best songs are ""Silicon World"" and ""Dub in Life."" This thing is a must buy for anyone."
4,Europop,"This album is probably one of the best eurodance albums out there, even if Eurodance was already gone since the mid 90's. Eiffel had one of the biggest hits of the year in 99 in Europe with ""Blue"" and later with ""Move your body"" the animated video was a blast and the great melodies, beats and lyrics were just perfect for a eurodance record. The whole album is very pleasant, and most songs are pure dance music, you can really hear that they come from the same group. The group made another album a few years later, a decent album too but not as good as this one. Most songs appeal to anyone into dance music, Songs like ""Blue"" were surely more commercial then alot of other dance but too good to not be played. A good and fun dance album! We need more of this."
5,Grab your mate and dance for days!,"No matter what the critics say, this is one entertaining CD. I love good dance music from groups like the Pet Shop Boys, etc., but Eiffel 65 has gone one better in my opinion. I absolutely cannot get the song ""Move Your Body"" out of my head. The same can be said for ""Blue"" and ""Hyperlink (Deep Down)"". Not very often do songs affect me this way. Great lyricists they are not, but Eiffel 65 has greatly succeeded in producing one of the catchiest dance albums in a long time. Great for parties or just kicking back by yourself with headphones on, you will enjoy this CD immensely, I promise."
4,"Good, despite the cheese.","One excellent quality about this disc is the abundance of meaningful lyrics. Of course, with meaningful lyrics comes cheese, if the band isn't careful. And that's what happens with Europop. However, there are several excellent songs (""Too Much of Heaven"", ""Dub in Life"", and, of course, the much too overplayed ""Blue""). Even cheesy tracks are still good (witness ""Your Clown"", with possibly the worst line ever, ""I don't want to be your clown, because I long to carry on"", yet still one of my favorite tracks). The only track I can't really stand is ""Hyperlink"" (which others seem to like a lot, for some reason). Luckily, it's at the end of the CD.All in all, it is a great collection of songs, more meaningful than most of the fluff you hear in techno these days (as a friend put it, ""vocals are great, lyrics are awful""), great beats, and very catchy melodies."
2,blue(dabadeedabadi),"Im from louisiana and on a radio station down here they wore that song ""blue"" out and I dont like it very much to tell you the truth if you are a fan of heavy metal & hard rock music you would hate eiffel65 but I like different kinds of music but mostly heavy metal but i used to listen to pop and when i did i hated eiffel65 but this is my opinion.listen to it yourself and share you opinion but I just dont like any of the songs by eiffel65."
3,"Not THAT great, but...","When ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)"" first came on the radio, it was a real catchy tune, and my sis really liked it a lot. I ended up going to buy this CD for entertainment purposes (and to add to my CD collection). I listened to Blue (Da Ba Dee) many times because I enjoyed it, and later I got sick of it. So afterwards I began searching for more catchy tunes on the CD and there weren't any. The other songs were dance songs without much effort put into them, at least, not as much as there was put into Blue.So, if you cannot stop listening to Blue, then you can buy it. But if you are looking for some descent music, find something else. Otherwise it's just a waste of time and money.Sorry to all of you out there who really like the CD, but you have to look at it from a whole perspective. Blue is really the only good song, with the exception of track 4."
3,"finally, a new techno/dance group!","I was getting worried for a while! Since the late '90s, there has been dance groups that were lame, to say the least. (La Bouche notwithstanding) Most of the groups around today produce mainly House, which is long, strung-out, and just plain boring, so it's about time a young group of guys produce some high-energy tracks! Yet it's a group of singles, not a cognitive album, which works out best for night-clubs, and night-clubs are the basis for techno/dance music. I must say, however, that the funky voice DOES get out of hand. If Eiffel 65 wants to remain popular, they ARE gonna have to think of some fresh material!"
3,Fair,Everybody talks about Blue (Da Ba Dee) but that is not the only good song on this CD. Sure my favorite is Blue but I also like Move Your Body. However not every song is that good so I can only give it a 3 star.
5,Eiffel 65 &#65533; too cool for words,"This CD rocks. That's all I can say, really. For me, I can listen to the songs over and over again and not ever get tired of them, especially with my favourite, Blue, which I see on muchmusic and play on my CD player EVERY SINGLE DAY but it is just as cool every time. Same thing with my 2nd favourite, My Console, which is already cool even though it could be better if it was about the N64, not the stupid Playstation. Anyway, I give this CD 5 stars for its totally cool, really catchy and addictive music."
1,HORRIBLE,"This has to be the worst cd that I have ever heard. The beat is bad, but also the same throughout the whole cdAny real techno fan should never hear this cd, and any real techno fan should never be looking up eiffel 65 either.I have done this as a public service announcement to all. If you think this cd is techno then you are living underneath a rock."
3,They've got potential,"This was one of the few CD's I've bought on the strength of one song, and like the others before it, I was expecting to get a group that based their strength on that single. However, much to my pleasant suprise, there's more on this CD than just ""Blue"". At times they get very ""Depeche Mode"" sounding, which I was a little iffy about (they're treading on sacred ground there) and there are several tracks that never rise much above mediocrity.""Move Your Body"" is one of the better tracks, along with ""Too Much of Heaven"" and ""Your Clown"".Personally, I'd reccomend picking this up if you want a CD, but arn't really looking for anything in particular, or want something to run as background music. It'll take a lot for Eiffel 65 to measure up to the heavy names in trance/techno/rock like Chemical Brothers and Crystal Method, but there's some potential here."
2,Its not the best,"I originally heard Blue in Hungary over the summer and loved it and when it came out here, I knew I had to buy the cd. To my dissapointment only like 2 songs besides Blue are good..The rest are odd. Normally, I LOVE European techno, but this isn't anything like it."
4,I never wanted to vacume until i heard this!,"This cd is fantabulous! Every song has a new upbeat twist. So what ever it is you are doing be ready to get down, i am sure you won't be able to help your self! Get this cd - you won't regret it!"
2,"Don't confuse ""Europop"" with ""techno""","This album is a poor attempt at selling European dance/techno music to ignorant Americans who don't know what techno really is. The songs on ""Europop"" are just that, Europop, except with the added ingredients of stupidity and blandness ( These guys are like Aqua with a male singer). Their lyrics are nauseatingly stupid, just listen to ""Another Race,"" or the song about the Playstation (Come on, is that really what music is about? Writing about video games?) Yes, Blue is catchy, but the song is truly idiotic and makes a mockery of the techno genre. But don't hold yourself back from buying this because of me (not that you would). However, if you want to try listening to true techno, try Gigi D'Agostino, or Antiloop. Eiffel 65 is just another boring, cheap techno imitation."
3,Something to be found,"From the perspective of a true dance/techno maniac, this CD is very mediocre. However, there are definiately two tracks I want to strongly recommend...""The Edge"" and ""Hyperlink."" these are two seriously great dance tracks. As far as Im concerned, ""Blue"" can be removed."
4,Surprisingly catchy (da ba dee),"Like most others in the US, I picked this CD up shortly after hearing the single ""Blue"" on the radio fourteen million and twelve times. All hype aside, while the lyrics aren't in any sense profound, they are more imaginative and worthwhile than most of today's mindless pop ballads. I would have to sum up this group's overall sound as that of cotton candy stuck in a vacuum cleaner, but it works well! I agree that the songs work best one at a time, and not necessarily all in a row; to the credit of Eiffel 65 they have produced something that is as unpredictable as it is satisfying. Go on and spend the money then MOVE YOUR BODY. Da ba dee. You just can't get them out of your head."
2,The whole vocal effect thing is TIRED,"I heard ""Blue"" on the local top 40 radio station and said ""wow, something cool on the radio for a change."" i saw the album on sale, bought it, and was so bored with the whole thing. That vocal effect is on EVERY song. Gets a '2' for catchiness and succeeding in penetrating the US market album sales with something that doesn't involve rap or a cover of a country radio song."
1,STOP! Before you buy this album...,"Check out Basement Jaxx ""Remedy"", then buy Eiffel 65's ""Europop"". The song Blue will lose it's novelty and end up on the used CD shelves before long. If you consider yourself to be a novice listener or even a hardcore techno full-on junkie, you would know that the Astralwerks label has the visionaries.. Chemical Bros., Fatboy, Les Rythmes Digitales..Buy ""Remedy"" by Basement Jaxx and buy the single for Blue (if you must)"
4,You should buy this !,this album only got couple of good song and that's it. songs like Another Race and Dub In Life. Not all the album is dance.. They got 3 or 4 songs that is not dance and they aren't good(except Too Much Of Heaven).Bottom Line:Buy!
2,i just want to tell you people how horrible eiffel 65 is,"I am ashamed to have ever owned this album, but I just hadn't heard Daft Punk and Basement Jaxx yet. The formulaic and cliched rhythmic and harmonic devices prevalent in this completely unoriginal type of dance pop are all present ad nauseum on this cd. It is mostly the four on the floor thing made for dancing, and I guess that's okay as long as you don't listen to the lyrics. Oh god the lyrics are horrible, they are all either bad extended metaphors (Hyperlink) or stories that don't make any sense (Blue) or preschool life lessons (Living in a Bubble). Please find good techno music and don't listen to this please."
2,"Well, I wouldn't reccomend it, they are all the same!","I think that after Blue Da Ba dee, they ran out of ideas for songs, so they based it on the same song every time, but it is O.K., if you like buying all the same stuff."
3,Not a bad look into the life of a hard rocker,"I enjoyed the easy-to-read Grace Slick autobiography. If you want a clear look into the life of a rocker from the 60s-70s, then this is a great read. Grace's life was an interesting carpet ride from gig to gig and her exploits during her Jefferson Airplane/Starship years are explained well. Kudos for a book that lets one peak into the mind of a rock star-- warts and all.Mary"
5,A look at Hollywood and a talented director,"What went into the release of Brazil is a fascinating look into how Hollywood operates and the lack of respect they have for the makers of movies and the audince that pays to watch the movies. A fascinating look at the ""dumbing down"" of movies and why it is so."
3,Fast enjoyable read,"This is a great book for fans of Brazil. It explains all the troubles the production ran into right from the beginning to the release. Beware, half the book is the original script. Not very interesting, unless you're planning on doing a remake."
4,The fight to get Brazil away from Sid,"This is an updated, revised, expanded version of the 1986 book by the same author. (Same title, too.)It's really good, covering the fight to release the director's cut of the film. The villain is Sid Sheinberg, one of the executives at Universal. Sid says he doesn't want to change Gilliam's movie, but he wants to change the end. Changing the end changes the whole POINT of the film. So Sid pretended that the battle is over the length of the movie. He tried to get between the producer (Arnon Milchan) and Gilliam. He sort of succeeded, too.Then the LA critics chose Brazil as the movie of the year, even though it hadn't been released. (The author was one of those critics.) That move raised the stakes much higher, and ultimately led to Gilliam's victory."
3,Great little toy with a few drawbacks,All in all this is a great player. The worst thing about it is the headphones. I guess I have small ears because they don't even fit inside. My husband said he wore them for one hour and they hurt his ears so bad he threw them out. We had to run out and purchase a better headset. Also...the FM tuner is a separate entity that attaches by a cord to the player. Don't be fooled by the size because now you have to have 2 things clipped to your belt. That was a big disappointment. It never said that anywhere!
5,The Zondervan KJV Study Bible Large Print Edition,"This is an excellent study Bible. The notes are plentiful and the layout of the text is aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. The Bible itself lays flat when you open it which is good. The quality of the Bible as far as how its made is ok, but not great. Oxford does a much better job with their Scofield III Study Bibles than does Zondervan as far as the stitching of the binding goes, but this Bible should nevertheless provide you with a lot of use. Some might consider it a bit bulky but its actually not all that big considering the text size and the amount of information it contains. I'ld definately consider it portable. So, if you like the KJV, and this is the 1783 Edition i believe, and you want a good Study Bible as well, this will fill your need. God Bless!"
4,Just what I was looking for,This study bible was just what I was looking for. I like the King James Version. The comments on the bottom of each page are helpful in my studies. The only other thing I would add to this bible would be tabs for each book on the outside edge.
3,Quality but very slow,Item shipped on 20th of Nov. and arrived Dec 4th. Was begining to wonder if it shipped via burro. (smile) However it arrived in good shape. So as long as you aren't in any hurry A1 has good prices.
5,great bible,"The study bible is beautiful to look at and the print size is great. I purchased it for my daughter's 25th birthday as a study bible and I am considering ordering one for myself. I love how the study design is on each page and the print size is perfect for the ""older eye""."
5,great shoe,"I ordered a pair for christmas for my youngest daughter in Miami Red, she loved them...online now to order another for my 17 year old because she loved them too....and I loved the price."
2,Picture Misleading,"I bought these shoes in Miami Red for my teenage daughter. They looked so cool in the picture, but we were extremely disappointed when they arrived. Instead of the stripes being bright they were extremely dull and the color in the picture is nothing like the color on the actual shoes. Also, the stripes are fuzzy. It's extremely wierd. We haven't decided if we are keeping them or not. I think maybe the all white shoes or the ones with the dk. blue stripes might be OK, but those stripes are probably fuzzy(wierd) too."
4,"nice product, however the size is a little off.","maybe it's my own fault, but watch out for the size, i usually wear 7.5~8, and for this one, i can put two fingures in the shoe. not sure if there was a size chart or not. otherwise, good choice."
3,"Cowboys Take Care of their Horses First, their women Second.","The film, [ASIN:B001LUYN5Q The Outlaw]] gives an interesting historical account on the lives of Doc Holiday and Billy the Kid with a couple of scintillating scenes with Jane Russell. I was unfamiliar with these actors, I hope they didn't quit their day jobs. The storyline was weak, script was poorly written and delivered, it seemed the main purpose of the movie was to highlight Miss Russell's headlights and speculate on the relationship between these two infamous outlaws. It's interesting how these film makers tried to capitalized using Miss Russell's voluptuous body(she obviously had no formal training)in a racy movie about men who regarded women as a commodity, valuing them less than their horses."

5,Wow! This is working....Im on my way!,"I have been a smoker for 20 years. Ive tried everything. The patch, nicotine gum, you name it. Then i came across thie book. Ive always known that the real problem was mind over matter. I just didnt know how to start. This book is amazing. It really does explain how to kick the habit one step at a time. Ive already broken 2 links. This is great! Im on my way, I know it. I was so excited, i wanted to share the news. Thanks for the help Mr Mahajan. Sincerely A Futrue Non Smoker!"
2,classic,this is one one my childhood favorites. however if you're not a Vandam or a martial arts fan DO NOT buy this DVD. i remembered liking it more as a child
4,Kickboxer starring Jean-Cleade Van Damme,"Following his hit Bloodsport, Kickboxer was done in the same tradition. Although when compared to todays acting and action films, this movie was one of the mainstream originators and still deserves a look-see. One of the Van Damme essentials."
5,Nik Su Cow!,"Van Damme's brother gets his body mangled in a kickboxing match against Tong Po. When that happens, he decides to learn karate and defeat the ugly monster. The man who hurt his brother is the ugliest thing since Furby. But uglier! He has a long ponytail and a shaved head. When Van Damme learns karate, he does the splits and gets coconuts thrown onto his stomach. Ouch! How unyielding! When Van Damme steps into the ring, a whole new light shines upon the two warriors. Godliness has never been as clean as this. Van Damme gets trounced on, but comes back in slow motion with high kicks, two-fisted thrusts, and jump kicks! Van Dammage! This movie is the ultimate comeback, just like ""Rocky""."
2,"Uhh, what?",Everything was fine with the order. The seller was prompt and the DVD was in perfect condition. I was looking for Kickboxer with JCVD and was in too much of a hurry to look past the glared picture to see that it was not in fact the movie I wanted. This movie looks like Eric Stoltz in a martial arts flick! I'll be sure to get good and drunk with a bunch of friends before we watch it so it'll be as awesome as I wish it were.
5,Kickboxer Kicked Butt Van Damme was GREAT,The movie was the best of Van Damme I have ever seen. The fight scenes were great. I would find myself getting out of my chair and just start pretending I was fighting along with him. If your a fan of Van Damme this is the movie you would want to see. IT ROCKED
3,"First Van Damme film has heart, but little else...","I'll admit I had fun watching ""Kickboxer,"" but I was disappointed at the end. The final fight could have been more exciting, with a stipulation that has become classic in martial-arts movies. But this film borrows too much from other great movies like ""Rocky"" and ""The Karate Kid,"" and in the end there is little that has come to pass. But it is fun. Dennis Chan is great as the kickboxing master, Xian, and I liked the guy who played Van Damme's brother. It's not bad for Van Damme's first starring role, but he's done better since."
4,America has defeated Thailand,Jean Van Damme is a corner man for his brother he is a Muay Thai fighting champion in the U.S. they went to Asia in Thailand to fight their champion Tom Pole over their the fighting is different Van Damme's brother learn that the hard way because of that he was paralised by Tom Pole and can not walk again. Van Damme was so upset he wanted to fight Tom Pole of course he is not good enough so he went to get trainning by Zion he lives in a remote area in Thailand and a master. Van Damme fell in love with his niece.
5,"The Classic, The Best","This has to be the best Van Damne movie with Bloodsport and Hard Target, get this movie its Van Damne's best, 4.8/5"
4,Martial-Arts fans wake up!,"Everybody in search of a good story or anything else that would normally make this title worth a look: Go away! This is for Martial-Arts fans only! But if you like the old fashioned ""good guy gets trained by wise old master to kick the butt of the bad guy""-movie Type: Go ahead! Buy this! This early van Damme movie delivers it all (unlike most of his more recent ones): Great fights with a stunningly energetic choreography and one of the longes training-sequences ever to be seen in a movie. Especially the final fight agains evil Tong Po is a feast for every Martial Arts junkie. Going over almost 12 minutes (beware of the heavily cut german and english versions!) this fight is one of the best, ever satged with van Damme showing all he's got, only that here it's much better filmed than it was in ""Bloodsport"" for ex. His famous ""Splits-kick"" can be reviewed in this movie again, too! If only he would be doing this kind of stuff still. END"
3,Jean Claude's best second to Bloodsport and Timecop,"I'm not a huge Jean Claude fan but I give credit where credit is do and this movie gets it. If you like Kickboxing or martial arts in general than you will like Kickboxer (why else would you be reading this review?). I won't give the plot in great detail but mainly Jean Claude goes to Thailand to learn Muy Thai in order to avenge his older brother's injury due to a fight with the champion Tong Po. As in Bloodsport, you get to see Jean Claude train to perfect his fighting skills though I'm not making definite comparisons between the two movies. Even if you don't really care for Jean Claude Van Damme but like martial arts, you should still check this one out. Now one thing I don't like about martial art dvd's is that most of them lack in the features department and this one is no different. Plus, this one is in full frame and not widescreen which is a shame."
2,Subpar,"I am a VanDamme fan, so I've watched this movie several times. Each time, I keep hoping it will be better than the last. I think this movie is a cheap (even though it cost more) ripoff of Bloodsport. I think they just wanted another Bloodsport since that one did so well. Van Damme is a little too self-congratulory. The relationship is fairly unbelievable. And that part at the end when Kurt is angry with his girl (cant remember her name), demanding the truth that she was raped and beaten by TongPo (his nemesis), instead of consoling her. She decided not to tell him because she doesnt want to disturb his concentration, but instead starts crying and begging forgiveness for her inexcusable behavoir. You can tell they filmed it that way to get the ""the girl has done him wrong too"" feeling going. Ugh..."
4,Interesting movie,I was looking for kickboxer starring Van Damme when I found this one. Van Damme doesnt star in this film. This is a much older movie with different actors and the plot of this film pretty much involves two rival gangs who go at it the majority of the film but there are some fight scenes which are good. When purchasing this film the image shown is the movie so if you are looking for the kickboxer starring van damme this isnt it. Look at image and actors before purchasing.
4,"Good Movie, But DVD?","This is one of Van's better movies. Its a good action martial arts flick, but why Full Screen DVD? I'll get it on Widscreeen better."
5,TOTALLY FAR OUT,THIS WAS THE BEST OF VAN DAMM I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS I FELT LIKE I WAS IN THE MOVIE WITH VAN DAMME. THE FIGHTING SEENS WERE TOTALLY AWSOME AND GOT ME KNOTTED IN MY BED AS I WAS HELPING HIM FIGHT. MORE OF THIS KIND OF MOVIES AND HE WILL SURELY BE REMEMBERED NOT JUST FOR A VEW MONTHS BUT A LIFE TIME. THE DIRECTOR REALY DID A GOOD JOB OF PUTTING US IN THE MOVIE. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK JAUN CLAUDE.ALTHOUG I AM A GIRL I ENVY THIS MOVIE
3,good show,I've only seen a few episodes of this but what I have seen is a good show with drama but also tidbits of comedy and good acting from some of today's finest young actors. I can't wait to see the rest of the episodes with Mischa Barton. I love Rachel Bilson....her character is sooooo cute!!!!
2,Mis-in-form,"I purchased what I thought was a Nikon EN-El4 Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery in ""good"" condition. Upon recieving the battery I checked to see what kind of condition it was in. The battery has 5 levels of life: New, 1, 2, 3, 4 or replace. When I checked the battery its level was 3 or fair, but of course tomorrow it could be 4 or replace no way of knowing if it is a strong 3 or weak 3. I figured a level of 2 would constitute a rating of ""good"". And so it goes."
1,not happy,Impossible to follow instructions. She moves too fast through the lesson and i found it impossible to follow her hand movements and foot positions
4,"Nice stuff, but you should catch her ""in person""","She usually works (as is the case here) with two guitarists who are super. Heard her ""live"" at Vinicius in Ipanema/Rio doing nothing but Bossa Nova, mostly Tom Jobim's compositions -- SENSATIONAL !! Looks like a fashion model, sings well -- not ""great"" -- but her presence and on-stage style makes it only a TCH under ""great."" By the way, she shared the bill with Marcello Lappa (as I recall), another terrific performer."
1,What happened Matt?,"First off, I just want to say that I love Matt's work with Weezer and The Rentals. Those are some of my favorite discs, period. That being said, I can't believe this disc was produced by the same guy. I had to force myself to listen to this because I kept thinking that maybe I was missing something, but no...this is just experimental garbage...Some tracks begin with long instrumental pieces, interjected with very sparse vocals...ugh. This is not commercial music at all. There is nothing catchy here, no rhythm, no melody...save your money."
5,acoustic masterpiece!!,"First of all I don't see why people keep saying ""If you are a major weezer fan, you should buy this"" becuase this is nothing like weezer or the rentals, and I'm sure Matt still doesn't like to be compared to them. You can tell from the song ""Goodbye West Coast""Ok this is the review:This album makes me want to become a musician. Matts voice gives it a nice folk feeling to it along with the acoustic. This album sohlud be apart of your collection of cds!!!"
2,transitional record,give em a break he needed to get away and do this. not that fun to listen to but the artist evolves...
4,gift,It is a gift for my sister's birthday. What else should I say? nothing else.I am going to s top reviewing
3,Not as good as Get the Message CD5,"Not as good as Get the Message CD5. But if you want every Johnny Marr guitar etc ever played, you gotta have these remixes. Much like the manchester crazed dance sound of Happy Mondays or Stone Roses remixes, these mixes have more bass and great for long dull drive somewhere. The lyrics are like a little story. Not too happy, not quite sure what they are talking about. Did it matter when your cranium was full of ecstasy in the UK?"
4,Rare find but fits just perfectly,"German craftmanship with precision. A little bit more expensive than the knock down rings at eBay, but definitely worth it."
2,Stuck,This ring is thin and light but once it's on it's on. I put a circular polarizer on it and there was nothing I could do to get it off. Maybe I should have saved my money and bought the Adorama instead.
3,Not the item pictured,The company that provided this ring sent three rings piled together to span the gap.This is common practice in the photo community but it is not the item pictured.Don't expect to get one solid ring.I needed it right away so didn't send it back.
3,Not so sure!,"I tried it on my lens and it indeed fits well into my nikon lens thread however, when I tried to fit my 77mm Hoya Filter the thread doesn't seem smooth. Removing it was difficult the it seemed like it was stuck. I had a little rough time unscrewing my filter off the adapter. This experience prompted me to order a filter wrench because it gave me a scare. It would have been difficult if it happened on the field!"
1,review? Funny!!,"Review what? I didn't get the step-up ring I ordered! The package was lost, and Adorama didn't answer my question, why I couldn't receive the step-up ring I bought? Luckily, I wrote to Amazon after couple days waiting, and got the answer. Now I am waiting for the refund."
4,Unstoppable Read,"I read this book in the short span on 5 hours. Although there might be some mistakes on the author's part about schizophrenia, this book was a terrific read! Full of many plot twists, a surprise ending (that I had a little trouble believing) and never-ending suspense, I would recommend this book for anyone looking for an entertaining story!"
3,"A great premise, but could be shorter","The plot for Deaver's novel is a great one, but he misses the mark in telling it. The book starts off excruciatingly slow, and only picks up in the latter half (which, incidently, has the makings for a great movie). Overall I like the characters and the storyline, but if I weren't one of those people who *must* finish a book once it's started, I probably never would've gotten to the good part!"
1,what a dog!,"Now that the author has a little fame, he has re-released this dog of a book. It is very disjointed and one of the worst books I have ever had the displeasure to read."
1,Contrived and Superficial,"The purpose of this novel is to create suspense and it does that but the characters are stereotypical and seem incredible with one unbelievable episode after another. There is a good description of the process of tracking a fugitive using a trained dog, but even there the story seems farfetched. One can skim through the book quickly in an evening and not miss much, just to get the gist of the story. The plot twists and turns and ends up with a surprise at the end. But on the whole dumb characters do dumb things and it might be better to spend time with another book. This book does not make for pleasant reading. The characters are all unlikable except for the dog."
3,Not one of my favorites,"After having read later works by Mr. Deaver such as The Empty Chair and The Coffin Dancer, I wanted to try some of his earlier books. What I love about Deaver is that he is always pulling some plot twist out of his sleeve you didn't expect. This happens to some degree in Praying for Sleep, but much too little and much too late in the story. The plots seems to take way to long to get to some kind of major confrontation. All in all, I'm not sorry I read this one. I still enjoyed it but not as much as some others. I will be interested in reading more of his earlier stories as well as the newer one's to determine at which point Jeffery Deaver became one of my favorite authors."
3,Praying for the end.,"This is not one of Jeffrey Deaver's best works. The book is about a woman named Lis who, a few years back, helped convict Michael, a schizophrenic of murder. Now Michael has escaped from a mental institution and he's trying to get to Lis. The ending was a complete surprise to me and I'd have to say that he had me fooled. But the book is long and drawn out. There are a lot of events that could have been left out, I think. I don't even think I'd recommend this to a Jeffrey Deaver fan. It's just not that good."
1,"Boring book, waste of time!!!","I read the other review about this book. I dont understand how reader enjoy the book. its boring, many twisted plots is unnessery, the end is little surpising but not convincing at all.I read the book 10 days and I just wait to see where the book will become interesting- its not happen. I never feel so boring in reading a book. This is my second book of deaver. I read the vanished man and I very enjoy but this book was inferior.Maybe one thing in the book was enjoyable and this is the descriptions of Deaver- like the description of the childhood ofHrubek and of Lis- this was touching and maybe this give me the fews moments of enjoy in the book."
2,It was&#65533;(yawn) unsatisfying,"After reading Jeffrey Deaver's The Bone Collector, I couldn't wait to get my hands on any Deaver novel. I bought Praying for Sleep with the hope of more nailbiting action. Boy was I sorely disappointed! The slow pacing made me want to to pull my hair out! It took me almost a month-on and off-to finish the book. I could care less if Hrubek was caught or not, he never made sense and the end was too convenient for my taste. I'm supposed to feel bad for Lis Atcheson's plight but in the end, I didn't care either way. The characters were very one-dimensional and I didn't sense any humanity in them. There was no sense of urgency I usually associate with page turner thrillers. If you're looking for really good Deaver books, I highly recommend The Bone Collector and its sequel The Coffin Dancer."
3,A flat not gripping story,"I have read other work of the same author and this is not the expression of the Jeffrey Deaver I read and fully admire. The prose is very colloquial and the action packed suspense is not very well deeply developed. Characters are somewhat flat with the exception of Lis and Hrubek. I read the whole story but could put it down anytime in search for a better entertainment. This book is not at the same level of ""A maiden's grave "" and ""The bone collector"". The worst sin of this book is that I could not find it gripping"
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"The refreshing thing about Jeffrey Deaver is that, unlike so many other attorney-authors, he doesn't feel compelled to jump on the Grisham/Turow bandwagon.The bad thing about this is that Deaver attempts to tackle subjects without burdening himself with proper research.Only Deaver's well developed gift for wordsmithing keeps this book from a one star rating. The protagonist, Michael Hrubek, while a sympathetic character, is one who is plainly insane, therefore incapable of being identified with. As with much of Hemingway's fiction, there was hardly a character in it that I found appealing or rooted for, including Hrubek, who hardly utters a single coherent sentence in the entire story.The only other reason why this snoozefest got a second star out of me (aside from the fact that you cannot give half stars) was the surprise ending.This is plainly not a book to be sequelized and let us thank God for small favors. Deaver was clearly coasting here."
2,praying for action,"I was devouring Deaver's titles, one after another because of his book ""Devil's Teardrop"". But I was really disappointed by P.F.S. The plot is slow moving. I'm one-third through and I'm not sure what Hrubek wants. I keep hoping for action and it was a big let down one after another--like watching a B-grade horror flick. It's been a month since I bought the book and I'm still unable to finish it. It's simply too tiring. Skip this. It really isn't one of Deaver's best works."
3,No Surprises on this one,Although a fairly good read I figured out the ending half way thru the book and I never guess right in most mysteries. The character of Michael Hrubeck saves the book as most of the others are not that interesting. Overall it is a fairly average mystery with some good plot twists.
4,Another excellent book from Deaver,Jeffery Deaver has done it again. Praying for sleep is an easy-reading crime-thriller with his usual superb character description and development and a plot which keeps you guessing right to the end!
2,I've learned my lesson,"I am a tried and true Jeff Deaver fan.... at least I was untilI read ""Praying for Sleep."" It didn't actually put me sleep,but it definitely annoyed me. The author jumps around from one scenario to another, most of which are highly implausible. The book is confusing and slow. I bought it based upon my reading of Deaver's other works. I neglected to read the Amazon.com reviews. I've learned my lesson."
5,Never Met A Deaver I Didn't Like,"I recently found this ""older"" Deaver novel I had somehow overlooked. It is every bit what I have come to expect and love from a Deaver novel. Simply put, the man is a master storyteller. Even by now, after reading most (13?) of his books, and knowing there are plot twists and turns . . . and knowing my head is going to get messed with . . . and knowing I would love to FOR ONCE actually get the twists right . . . I still can't. I still wind up surprised by the fifty different ways the story takes you before the end. Some people call that whiplash; I call it the cure for predictable by-the-numbers thrillers.The plot does not need repeating here, but this does: read this book. I recommend this, and the other Deaver novels, without hesitation."
5,Exhaustive,"Roman Realities is an old book and generally conservative in its study, but it seems to have been very well researched. It starts from the earliest days of Rome and recounts the story right through to the fall of the empire. There is a lot to digest here but Hooper provides the reader with a fascinating exploration of the subject.Darkhorse86"
4,Birds like it,"birds like it and reasonable price. I tried to cut it up into slices, it was a little messy but it worked."
4,"So cheap, why not?",Pros: Weighs next to Nothing. Costs next to nothing. Fits in my cook kit. Well worth the SEVEN DOLLARS. If mine breaks I will probably buy another one for SEVEN DOLLARS.
3,Adds stability but could be better.,"Thanks to the other reviewers I have not broken my Canstand by trying to move the fixed leg.The tripod concept is great but the can size accommodation is not so good. Take the Canstand with you when you are buying fuel canisters to make sure they are compatible. For instance, the Snow Peak GigaPower 110g canister does not fit the Canstand."
3,Works exactly advertised but breaks too easily,"Like another reviewer here I found out that the stand for this fuel canister breaks far too easily. First, the good news:- Fits almost all types of isobutane canisters used for backpack style camping.- Folds up as compactly as you could wish, to almost nothing.- Adds much needed stability when items are on the stove.- Non-skid feet work very well and the stove stays put.Now the not so good:- When it is cold, it breaks quite easily.- Does not solve the stability problem completely, just helps a lot. The stove can still fall.Fortunately, it's so cheap I'm going to order two replacements right now, just to be sure."
3,"good idea, but doesn't fit 3.5"" canisters","Bought this for my Jetboil. I guess it could work, but it won't fit the 3.5"" wide canisters that nest so neatly inside the Jetboil."
2,"Good idea, just wish it fit better","This stand is loose on Brunton gas canisters. Its difficult to put on because its just small enough you have to tilt it a bit to get in the grooves, yet big enough it easily tilts over and comes off. Getting a stove level with this on is harder than leveling one without it. Works good on a level picnic table though."
4,"Lightweight, serves purpose, but not quite so sturdy","The title pretty much sums it up. The Brunton Canstand is lightweight and folds up conveniently to slip right into a small utensils pouch. In use it took just a moment to attach it to a butane canister with a Coleman single burner stove. I boiled a pot of water, heated some beans/chili, and scrambled some eggs. The extra three inches along the base helped quite a bit with the stability, especially with the water. The only downside is that the three legs are made of plastic. As a result, though it is a few grams lighter, it has just a slight bit more play in the joints than is desirable. In a year or so of use I could see it loosening as the plastic wears away. I took off half a star for this, and also a half-star for the pricing. It's under $10, but I've seen similar devices for $4."
3,Harmonograph: Still mysterious,"This tiny book is interesting, but not particularly enlightening with regard to the ""structure"" of music. Regardless, it was worth doing/having."
4,Not so sure how correct the author is...,"I'm not so sure that a triangle is an octave (2:1) and a fifth (3:2) is a pentagram. A fifth, combined with a fourth (4:3), forms an octave. It would make more sense if the Octave were a biangle (2/1), a fifth were a triangle (3/2/1), a fourth a quadrangle (4/3/2/1), and a major third a pentangle (5/4/3/2/1).(May I write my own book? Continuing, a minor third would be a hexangle (6/5/4/3/2/1), a second or whole tone would be a nonangle (9/8/7/6/5/4/3/2/1), and in between these two are notes that don't exist in the standard western tuning -- those forming a heptangle (7/6/5/4/3/2/1) and an octangle (8/7/6/5/4/3/2/1). ) To summarize, each ratio is just a pair of harmonics to a fundamental pitch, and the series of the harmonics from the fundamental to the ratio pair can be considered to be the corners of a geometric figure."
1,huh ???,"After about 5 pages into this thing I found myslelf becoming more and more baffled, as the author continually threw out various terminology with no explanation of it. I kept at it for a while and it didn't get any better. He has all sorts of drawings and diagrams, but again -- he does not define his terms or even give you a clue as to where find any definitions. If the book had a glossary this would be marginally tolerable, but it doesn't and it isn't. This is too bad, because the topic is fascinating and the author is obviously very knowlegeable. Unfortunately he seems incapable of sharing this knowlege with the reader."
2,"Successful diatribe about ""modern"" life","Although tagged as a novel, this work is a singular example of a polemic or diatribe even rant in the form of a monologue by one Joseph Shapiro whose target is modern America (c 1969) which country and its customs is synonymous with Sodom. Art, marriage etc in their modern manifestations are instances of how corrupt this society is. Purity can be found in the traditional Jewish faith. Joseph might be right. But it doesn't necessarily make for a riveting read. Most debates where only one side is heard, don't. For the converted only who like the sound of their own ideas."
2,What Can I Say?,"I took my chances buying this book though there were no reviews on it, and I lost. I wasn't able to finish the book. It bored me. It didn't hold my interest. I got ""Life At The Top"" also and I am sure hoping it will be better. I can't exactly pinpoint what I didn't like about the book except that it seems he wrote his chapters like magazine articles and then put them together as a book without noticing that certain names and things are already mentioned in past chapters. And there just wasn't anything to hold it all together, I guess it didn't go deep enough into the areas that would have interested me. But really, how can you write much of anything about a building, particularly one with so many comings and goings."
3,"Nice design, but a little fragile","This is a nicely designed teapot for three or four cups. I've been using it for six months, and while it was a bit thinner glass than I had hoped, it held up--for awhile. Yesterday, a piece of the cut glass at the bottom of the tea holder chipped off with little or no provocation. Now, tea leaves stream pretty freely through the hole. So it's not as useful for its purpose, which is to keep the tea out of the cup. So beware, don't count on this to be an heirloom. Otherwise, though, it's attractive and works well as long as the glass holds out."
3,Great for whole leaf teas,"As the previous reviewers mentioned, the teapot is great in terms of design and durability. No complaints there!! It looks adorable and I've washed it in the dishwasher for several years now with no problems. My only issue with it is when I brew certain broken leaf teas, which have finer particles, or with some of my Japanese teas, which have bits of toasted rice or matcha powder included with the whole tea leaves. They tend to clog the slits in the infuser, so I have to either use a different pot, or take out the infuser and use a strainer to filter the tea as I pour. Not a huge inconvenience for some, but if I'd known this earlier, I probably would have bought a different product."
5,Best of the Best,"This is a beautiful book with color pictures and clear details. If this doesn't make you want to taste virtually every single malt whisky from Scotland, nothing will.You can add your own notes and compare with Mr. Stirk's. Great fun!"
4,good detail about Mr Trapnells escapades in Montreal area,"Good detail about the crimes committed by Mr James B Garretti aka Garrett Brock Trapnell in and around Montreal as well as the carribean,shows just how bad the airport security and the banking industry was back then"
1,bad listing,The carryout lamp was supposed to be red. it arrived as a black one. upon notifying pop store they were supposed to send me the red ones with a return label to return the wrong ones. it never arrived. be certain the pic matches the heading. buyer beware!
1,Product Malfunction,"After one year of owning this product, the stereo suddenly had a power malfucntion and refuses to turn on for more the 2 seconds. Now I can't even get the CDs that were in the system when the power shut off out of the player. Customer service was absolutely no help and refused to give me a service location unless I gave them my credit card. Stay away from this piece of junk system."
1,Very Disappointed,"I had the same issue as the others where the power would come on for 3 seconds and then turn off. Fortunately, it was under warranty, but when Sony sent it back ""repaired"" there was another problem and I had to send it back to them. Now almost 2.5 years after buying it, it stopped working again. The previous Sony unit we owned lasted atleast 10 years. We gave it away in working condition.I wouldn't buy this model even though Sony generally has a good reputation."
1,Quite unreliable,"We have hod one of these for a little over a year (now out of warranty) and now the thing won't stay on for more than 3-4 seconds. I have not trashed it yet having found a way to repair it by changing a transistor on the motherboard. Luckily I know someone who can do that kind of work, but in general stay away from this thing. It looks and sounds great when it works, but won't work for long."
4,great cookbook,"Having newly changed my diet to vegan, this book provided easy to prepare foods that tasted great!"
2,Graphically Deficient,"I am an Earth Science teacher and recently purchased this software for use in our curriculum. My colleagues and I reviewed the CD and concur that although the disk presents a lot of information, the presentation, and most specifically, the graphics in the videos and animations, pictures, charts, and interactive exercises are so amateurish that students are not going to be able to learn very much from it. Almost all of the graphics are poorly drawn animations. The Rocks and Minerals Lab was the only activity that we felt was salvageable."
5,excellent introduction to Bony and Australian bush folklore,Death of a Swagman was written in the mid point of Arthur Upfields career and shows in his attention to detail and his ability to capture the feling of Australian country towns in the early part of our century. The story is a good detective novel in its own right with plenty of plots and action and red herrings. Bony's relationship with Rose Marie is used as a strong pivot point throughout the novel giving a useful viewpoint of the running of the town from a child's perspective. The advantage of this book over other bony novels is the character development of the subjects. This gives a depth and humanity which remains after the story is finished. The narrative of the swagmans lifestyle and its mythology is addressed here with great detail and provides a refreshing glimpse of a bygone era.
5,A must have!,"If you are looking for an industrial dance group that has all the awesome songs you could ever ask for... then Deitiphobia is right for you! Besides being an awsome band, they are also CHRISTIANS! I just love the songs Spit Static and SaviorSelf! They are up-to-date with some of the other secular composers. Deitiphobia is pulsating synthisized dance music with a touch of industrial. They have great vocals which are usualy under some cool voice distorter. Hi-fi vs. Sci-fi is a must have!"
4,A fascinating key ...,"Arguably controversial,Donald Tyson's treatment of the Holy Name and its magical implications and ramifications,with an extended reference to Enochiana cannot but act as a catalyst of ideas.Indeed,this is an unparalleled extensive treatment of the topic,while the author payed attention to the modern implications of the subject approached in his unique learned and critical manner.Whether one agrees with his assumption that the Enochian Keys are apocalyptic in nature-an interesting proposition in itself- has very little relevance;the merit of this book lies rather in its compelling ability of making the reader think and further explore the subject."
3,A for effort...,"As I do agree with the former comments on the book as far as jumping from Neophyte to level of 7=4 grade, I must say that, however, he did do a nice job on analyzing the Enochian Keys, unlike any other, and the sigils of the Governours of the Aethyrs is greatly appreciated. He did, as was mentioned before, should have wrote an intermediate guide for those inexperienced, but for the expereinced, I see it as help as those who seek the Mysteries behind Keys 1-18. 93, 93/93"
2,"Ineresting read, but that's about it.","Tyson does it again with yet another opinionfest, just like his book ""The New Magus"" and ""Enochian Magic for Beginners"". Although ""Enochian Magic for Beginners"" was a useful book, it was more theory than fact. ""Tetragrammaton"", on the other hand, has barely any practical value at all. It's nothing but one experimental theory after another. Almost useless. Now, it got 2 stars because it IS an interesting read and it brought up a lot of thoughts in my mind. Perhaps it can do the same for you."
3,"Interesting veiwpoint, but riding the fence","Whereas I have found some dissapointing discoveries in many of Tyson's early works, this rides the fence. It is interesting to give the Enochian Aethyrs a veiw from a total Christian veiwpoint, but there is more than just Christianity lined within the Enochiana. Tyson is very Christian, and he makes this clear in a subtle way, and bases many of his opinions of general Occultism this way. I would not recommend this book to the beginner in Enochian Magick, but perhaps for someone who wants to look at it in a different veiw. As far as the Enochiana being the Keys to the Apocolypse...perhaps so, but I would not aim to attempting to release ol' 333...he might just burn the back of your neck!"
1,NOT the actual product!,"I received this, anticipating it to be the long sought out L'air Du Temps By Nina Ricci Body Powder, and was very disappointed. I still have a small amount of the actual powder and KNOW the scent very well so as to not be fooled. It was returned and my money refunded."
3,L'Air Du Temps body powder,"If I were just rating the body powder itself, I'd give this a 5-star plus rating. I love the scent; it's lovely. I've worn this scent for years, but have found it much more difficult to find in the stores. I can find the perfume, but not the powder.When I saw this at Amazon, I was thrilled, and ordered it right away. However, what was delivered was not the little bath powder container with powder puff enclosed, as pictured, but a tall, shaker container (like a talcum powder container).Shaking powder on, after a shower, is not nearly as nice as using a powder puff from a container filled with the powder.Eventually, I just cut the shaker-type container with a knife, and emptied the powder into another container which would also hold a powder puff that I had. So - I would only recommend this to someone who didn't care that it is not in a nice container with puff, but is in a tall, narrow shaker-container."
2,Coffee,SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS COFFEE....MAXWELL HOUSE TASTE THE SAME OR BETTER..COFFEE BEARLY HAS ANY TASTE UNLESS TOU MAKE IT WITH A FULL FILTER FULL.
5,Sure makes a great gift,I purchased this subscription for my girlfriend and she seems quite happy with the content and presentation. I can't say I've paged through it myself but she made a point of asking me to be sure I renewed it for her which is probably the best review a magazine can get.
5,Lucky Finds,"""Lucky Magazine"" is a versatile magazine that showcases both cheap and high end clothes/beauty products. For instance, they feature a stylist section on Rebel Wilson and help her pick an eclectic range of clothes to accentuate her frame (on page 44 is a 40 dollar dress and another dress for 29 dollars). Page 131 features Sofia Vergara wearing a classic K-mart outfit consisting of a 25 dollar shirt and 27 dollar jeans. ""Lucky Magazine"" is a good magazine if you are looking for fashion ideas that are classy bargains."
2,Too many Ads,This magazine is a quick read because there is not much to read! It's like a catalog of new clothes and bags. It seems to be targeted towards teens and young adults. The whole magazine is just full of ads. The good thing was that I got the subscription at a really low price.
1,Very Un-Lucky Subscriber,"Wow! I didn't realize how bad a magazine could be! Sure, I knew it was all advertising and all about shopping. But it does that job so poorly! The so-called ""fashions"" are silly and unattractive, and the ads are boring. Despite the minimal price, I've cancelled my subscription."
2,why do I have old issues!?,"I like the magazine, but its pretty ridiculous that when I started my subscription they sent me last months issue, I got Septembers issues a couple weeks later, and the now there is an issue on stands that I don't have. I'm sorry but people who have a regular subscription to a magazine should get it BEFORE it hits news stands!!!"
1,Get Serious,"Hello, girls - I cannot believe any of you would actually PAY for a subscription to a ""magazine"" that is mainly an ad. I checked out this vacuous no-brainer while being forced to wait for an appointment. Only for those who have been brainwashed by being a tiny-tot beauty pageant participant."
1,Very Egoistic Magazine,"This magazine is for people who like to waste money on extremely over-priced clothing. I hate this magazine but, I hate shopping and thinking about shopping. If you are heavily into your external appearance and want to spend a small fortune on yourself, than this is the magazine for you."
5,Get lucky!,"I so look forward to this magazine every single month. It is filled with the latest styles and it's never too overly trendy. I like how they pair the newer pieces with classics. Also, I love when they have a whole section devoted to bags. This is a great, great magazine and I highly recommend it, along withInStyle (1-year)."
3,Confused,"Based on the time I signed up for this subscription and the time stated for expected delivery I was confused to get July's issue. I had purchase this already purchased this in June! Yesterday I received September's and I was happy about that, however when I got home tonight August (which I already had) was in my mail box! I really hope I DO NOT get September again. So far I am not happy. I love this magazine though."
5,got it faster than expected,"love this magazine, much better than glamour. got it much faster than expected and got two issues back to back."
4,"Great magazine, strange start to subscription","I received three issues last week of this magazine...March, April and May. I subscribed in February. I'm guessing that all three counts toward my year subscription? Other than that, the magazine is great! Glad I subscribed. It's got shopping ideas for women of all ages and budgets."
2,Big Advertisement,"Basically, you're paying money for them to advertise to you. This is one big overpriced catalogue. You should only get this magazine if there's a deal and they're offering it for free in conjunction with something else you purchase. It's not worth paying for."
4,Truly great eye candy for fashionistas!,"I love leafing through the issues, looking at all the latest styles and colors! It's definitely not mentally stimulating in any way, just great fashion and accesories to mull over buying!"
2,"too much ads, boring","It is a magazine about women fashion - shopping, with a lot of ads and other useless articles.If you like women fashion - shopping, with a lot of ads...etc, then buy it.""Lucky"" me I got my subscription for free from a amazon promotion, otherwise I would never get this for anyone."
4,Hip and Useful,"I actually really love this magazine. The articles are down to earth and helpful...not cheesy and shallow, like those found in Cosmo. The editorial staff of Lucky seems to really relate to real women and aren't ""bitchy and pretentious,"" like other women's magazines."
5,Best shopping Magazine,"Forget about shop etc... Lucky is the best shopping mag by far. I got alot of coupons for full size products an, samples inside of Lucky magazine. I love me some free samples! I am from NYC and you have to know what's wearing and all, so this mag let me know a whole lot about fashion, makeup, hair produts, house wares etc."
1,I hated this magazine!,"When I bought Lucky I thought it would be a great magazine because of the great reviews it had on amazon, but when I recieved it I absolutly hated it. The only thing that is in it is really skinny girls wearing the newest fashion statement. It has no real issues in it like teen people, cosmo, or self magazine would. This magazine is purely for people who love fashion and make-up so much that it totally rules their lives! I would recommend to anyone who is not a Barbie not to get Lucky. You should really get magazines that have real issues about real people, not just a magazine about make-up and clothes that are way too much $$$$."
1,Never showed up,"I placed the order over a month ago and I still haven't received it. I placed another magazine order at the same time, and that one was delivered last week."
5,"Fun magazine, great for shopping","This magazine is pretty cool. In the beginning of the magazine is a page full of stickers that you can place on pages that interest you. I find this to be a pretty unique feature. The magazine is full of quick little articles on every product of interest to women: clothes, styles, hair products, skin care products, etc. For someone who is interested in what is new or popular out there right now, this magazine will give you lots of new things to check out. I have had lots of magazine subcriptions to popular women's magazines... and this is one that I have renewed!"
1,Do Not Subscribe!,They said they sent 2 issues but i never received any of them. Waited 1 more month & never received single issue. Called them to cancel subscription & got my money back.
2,Magazine Fab! Subscription- not so hot.,"Lucky is one of my frequent checkout pickups. Bright, fun, and not requiring any frontal lobe interference, it's the perfect pick-me-up for the early morning commuter train. I give it five fabulous stars!However, the actual subscription was very underhanded! Within the space of a week I was sent last month's issue (long gone from the stands), the issue just about to decirculate, and, finally, the actual current issue. So, two weeks after my order i am already 3 issues in to a 12 issue subscription, and none too happy about it. Condé Nast needs to be told that subscribers do not exist to let them clear out their unsold backlog!"
4,Lucky is a star,"A magazine about shopping ... Does it get any better? It's like a whole issue of ""What's Hot Now"". If you like handbags, shoes, and clothes this one's for you. Info on cosmetics and skincare as well as hair too! It helps keep you posted on the latest styles in every price range. Recommends items from Target to 5th Ave. Some issues are better than others. I love the ""sticky tabs"" they provide for ""tabbing"" pages when you see somthing you like."
1,Deceptive Subscription Practices,Not only did I find the magazine nothing more than a junky catalog...but you should watch out when you subscribe to Lucky Magazine or any other Conde Nast owned magazine. They will automatically renew your subscription after the first year (I DID NOT sign up for auto renewal) and will continue to send bills. I asked for and paid for one year only!
1,Zero Stars,"I have a free one year subscription to this magazine and I can't wait until it ends. I was expecting a magazine full of articles, shopping advice, bargains, etc. What I received was a magazine packed with advertising, items I could never afford, and boring personal stories from a bunch of ""24 year olds"" that are really 40. Seriously, even if they were 24, how is that even relevant when they're just explaining why they like wearing white shirts when they have dark jeans on?If you have a lot of disposable income and want to find a few 10% off codes, then this is the magazine for you."
1,I absolutely hate this magazine!,"I thought this magazine would help steer me towards some great shopping tips and bargains. Boy, was I wrong! 98% of the items shown are expensive, so if you're a bargain hunter like myself, don't waste your time with this magazine. The articles are boring and most of the outfits showcased would look silly on the average woman. I think this is probably the worst magazine I've ever purchased!"
2,Not for the average woman!,"This magazine offers many different outfits but not for the average shopper, at least I hope not. The price of most of the pieces is over ... Which after buying 4 or 5 pieces to make up a complete outfit (... and up) is a little pricey for an outfit to wear out on a Saturday night. This magazine can help you find cute clothes ideas and then it's up to you to try to find something similar in your budget. My advice is to not waste your money on this magazine and find outfits you like from other magazines with more substance."
1,Lucky = Junk Mail,"This is definitely the worst magazine I've ever ""read."" I give the postmod quotes to ""read"" because there's absolutely nothing in this magazine to read. Unless you count ad copy. 90% of the clothing and stuff they highlight is insanely expensive. Need help selecting a $300 skirt? Then 1) this is the mag for you and 2) you're kind of pathetic. I got a free 1-year subscription so at least I didn't pay for it."
5,lucky nagazine,I just love all the information the magazine as to offer.The best in the back of it It'll have what's new in your area.
5,perfect for the fashionista,"lucky is a great, quick read. the stickers make it easy to tag and remember great looks, fab stores and products/websites to check out."
5,The most innovative thing to hit women's fashion magazines,"Brilliant all around, especially the little tabs for marking stuff that you may want to buy! The companion website is also updated properly. As noted earlier no hype...and best of all, most of the clothes featured are for real people and available at real prices. No $7,000 haute tissue holders here! Absolutely a must also for makeup/bodycare product junkies. Just order it, you will NOT regret it for a second."
5,The Best Pink Eiga title ever!!!!,"What a punk Pink Eiga! This one is so different than other Pink Eiga titles. No character has a normal life, but they are all approachable somehow. Many stories from vary characters mix together, lead to the tragic end... The plot is just great! Well developed'chronic story and cool pictures! The best Pink Eiga ever!!"
5,Great kids book on Pops Armstrong,This nicely illustrated little book is a great way to introduce kids to the life and music of Louis Armstrong. The biographical information dramatized is accurate (according to the latest footnoted biography of Pops by Terry Teachout -- also recommended) and presented in an engaging way. Highly recommended!
2,a book for a rainy day,"this is a hard to find book, writen about the danger that passionate love can bring to us. It is a romance novel, historically set, but stretches the credibility factor a bit. Good if you are stuck with some time to kill, but other than that, stick to other adventures."
4,Very Thorough Learning Resource,"This is a solid reference work for professionals in the learning and development space. It covers not only the theory and design, but also gives practical applications that are useful in the professional world.I use this as a resource for creating online training courses, where most of these principles still apply.It's a huge book (over 600 pages), so it's not exactly a weekend read, but very useful for learning professionals or those who are interested in human resources. I recommend a copy for your reference library."
2,displeased,"I ordered a new book and although it arrived in acceptable shape, it has been used as evidenced by yellow highlighter throughout the book."
4,Covers all the basics,"This book is highly useful for anyone trying to get an exact sense of how the training industry views itself, its purpose and its standard operating procedures."
4,Tobey and Reese!!,"Well, this movie in whole is not really together. It went to different directions from the original point somewhere down the line. Maybe because Mr. Gary Ross, the first time director, had too much to say in his directorial debut (he was a screenwriter. But the strong production value, the great cast, and the attention to artwork and to details are so winning that I can't help but to like this movie. Heck, anything Toby and/or Reese stars, I will watch."
4,"Great movie, but problems with DVD transfer","This is a funny and entertaining movie, but I had some Serious problems with the DVD between chapters 29 and 30. So bad, in fact, that I had to unplug my DVD player, then restart it, and then skip to chapter 31 and rewind to the problematic section. This is similar to a publisher sending out VHS tapes that are mangled at some mid-point of the movie and which get tangled in your VCR.I recommend the movie, but the DVD could cause you some problems."
3,A special effects dream..but lacked some things.,"Despite the very creative use of color against black and white Pleasantville's plot seems unthinkable. The unreal circumstances revolving around the transformation from California to Pleasantville are too Sci-Fi for a movie of the genre. Holding the movie together are the brilliant performances of Witherspoon, Maguire, and Joan Allen. Overall a good movie that with a little more thought could have been great. 3 stars."
2,An unconvincing film.,"Pleasantville is well-done from a strictly visual point of view, but it doesn't make a good case for its main conceit: that a ""pleasantly"" stable life is an unfulfilling one. I kept watching the movie thinking, why is this such a bad thing?Not that I favor all the details about the caricatures presented; I have no interest in seeing mothers cooped up in the kitchen, for instance, especially since I'd rather cook for myself. And the town's implied racism certainly has appeal for me.But the movie's theme has more to do with tone, rather than specifics. Pleasantville would have you believe that a pleasant life is bad, but generally speaking, the atmosphere of the town portrayed in the movie seemed very appealing to me. I can't figure out why that kind of overall climate is bad, details notwithstanding. And if you can't buy into the film's premise, you can't enjoy this movie."
5,"With the range from comedy to tragedy, Pleasantville has everything","An amazing film! And the viewers say:""I liked it! Creative!""""I thought it was well done, and the transition from black and white, to color, was well done. Great symbolism!""""Great acting! For the type of movie it was, it was quite believable.""""Book burning, 'colorism', gender issues, and change... this film touched on many subtle parts of American society.""The introvert and the extrovert, brother and sister, get ""pulled"" into a 1950s black and white TV sitcom, ""Pleasantville."" They also bring new ideas, and Pleasantville begins to change. Is it for the worse, or the better?There you have it, folks. Pleasantville was a success!"
4,It is a realy good show.,I felt that this was a good movie the symbolizem and referances twards racesisom are delivered in a way that is verry entertining and fun.
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"This movie was completely robbed at the academy awards. It definatly should have been nominated Best Picture. The basic idea of the movie was so simple (getting trapped in a TV show), and one would never expect it to get so complicated and deep. The performances were awe-inspiring, and the visual effects were astounding. I loved this movie for the way in which it took a simple idea and transpired it into a deeply touching motion picture."
2,Overrated,"Trying this again. Visually a great movie, but too many bones to pick. First of all, older sitcoms weren't THAT sterile. ( Did Beaver ever eat a breakfast like that? It never rained in an old sitcom? C'mon.) Also, why didn't the mob turn to color when thrashing the malt shop? Exactly when and where did the Whitey character enter the movie? Could go on but spent too many moments looking at the screen (when I wasn't dozing off ) and saying...WELL, DUH! Could have used some (any) humor and seemed as if it was written by someone who watches Mtv WAY too much. Thank you."
4,A Truly Thought-provoking Film,"I've seen this movie two times, and after my second viewing I discovered and understood a few things I missed during my initial viewing. Of course, films that aren't fully digested the first time usually end up being the best. Everything about this movie is well done. The acting is good, the special effects are amazing, and all kinds of thought-provoking themes float throughout the movie. The movie deals with many topics: mainly racism. The vandalization of the malt shop and the burning of the books signify aspects of Nazi Germany for instance. Myriad subjects-some more distinct than others are covered throughout this surprisingly good movie. Recommended."
3,"Great concept, but way too long","The first 45 minutes was great. I laughed very hard and caught most if not all of the jokes/old-time references. The movie lost me after an hour, though, as it had said all it needeed to. I thought it spelled too much out for the viewer and tried way to hard to get across its social-political messages, which were crammed down our throat (notice there is not a black person in Pleasantville, but the message of treating people ``of color'' well is made...repeatedly). This film has several Biblical overtones and references (one instance is a character offering Bud an apple). It is also full of holes, such as Bud begging the Don Knotts character to go home, then the do-it-yourself ending without any Oz-like guidance on how to do it (sorry...I'll trash the ending but I won't give it away). Pleasantville literally put me to sleep."
5,Brilliant Film!,"I expected this movie to be nominated and seriously considered for Best Picture of 1998. It's a dense photoimagistic essay on 20th century life using the metaphor of 50's television to carry the message, softly and without violence, of war, prejudice, and the confusion of youth in the 20th century. With each additional color, light is shed on perplexing topics. I think this is one of the best films I ever saw. It rates in my top ten."
5,remote traveling teens,"I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. A cute comedy. A brother and a sister fighting over a remote until it crashes into the wall and breaks. The repair man comes, gives them a new one and they get transported into the tv sitcom Pleasantiville. Bringing color to the world and disrupting it. I think this movie is super. I highly reccomend it."
5,I did get it.,"This is a classic movie. You'll love it, folks. As for a review, you either receive it or you don't."
2,"""Honey, I'm home!""","Teens George and Jennifer (Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon) are twins but Jennifer is a wild child while George's passion is watching re-runs of the 50s TV sitcom ""Pleasantville."" One night, the kids are magically whisked right into Pleasantville - a swell little town where the fire department only rescues cats in trees, books are as blank as the foks' minds, and everything is in black and white. George loves it there, but Jennifer starts changing things when she takes her boyfriend up to Lover's Lane. Gradually people start seeing things in color, then it rains real rain, and *gasp* dinner is not on the table at six o'clock.This movie left me confused and disappointed. It seems to equate sexual promiscuity with intellectual enlightenment. Maguire and Witherspoon are perfectly cast and give excellent performances, but the script ridicules old fashioned values. I did enjoy the photography changing slowly from black and white to color, but I cannot recommend the movie."
4,ENOUGH WITH THE CHRISTIAN GUILT-TRIP!!!,"Morals morals blah blah blah...your missing the point this movie is trying to make. This isn't an attack on christians, as the right-wingers would have us belive, after all they're so oppressed. Instead it has to do with the ability for us to take control of ourselves and discover ourselves. Sure, the way the movie chose to do it may have been a bit crude, but for CHRISTS SAKE...get over it!! This isn't meant to drive people down a morally-corrupt path! Its a fun movie with good intentions. Get off your soapbox."
5,A beautiful film,This film is a beautiful film that is so relavant to life we live today. Reese Witherspoon and her brother (Tobey Maguire) are stuck in a black and white Pleasantville. A very cute town where everyone is happy so there is no need for change. Reese Witherspoon starts bringing in her own culture from the modern world as we know it and Pleasentville starts changing into color. Tobey Maguire is discouraged that his sister is changing the town because he fears the citizens of Pleasentville wont be able to cope with change. He soons learns a powerful lesson about human nature and about his own life. This powerful film will open your eyes to a new era that forming as I write. Enjoy the film.
5,Great Time Travel Film,"The value of this masterful film is how it vividly portrays the transition those in the 50's made to their mindsets in adjusting to the exciting new culture emerging. The time of the 50's was a pivotal time in American culture. This film captures the essence of that time period and how people in the 50's began to open up to new ideas and lifestyles, some more than others. Pleasantville is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Its value is enormous in how it shows the exciting transition people made to a new time period and culture."
1,Steaming caca (in vivid brown),"This is one infuriating movie. A pleasant premise (and the goodwill of an unsuspecting movie audience) is turned on its head and exploited for what turns out to be the filmmaker's banal political opinions. Nothing in the second half of this movie is supported by the tone of the first half. I had a days-long disagreement with a friend about this movie in which I came up with a long list of inconsistencies and absurdities. I invite you to start your own list.But I will say this: It's a beautiful movie to watch (the transformations from black and white are gorgeous, and there's no denying the visceral power of the very first image of spot color), and Joan Allen, as always, rises above everything she's given. That's what makes it all the more frustrating. What a waste."
1,not my speed,"So much hype and praise for this film. I have no idea what all the fuss was about. If there was some sort of socialogical statement being made, it was lost on me. The story wasn't engaging, and the film on a whole, was weird. Didn't go for it."
2,Disappointed in sexual content.,"I assumed when making this purchase that this movie would be suitable for me to watch along with my two grandsons, ages 6 and 9 years old. Not so. It was a good movie but when the sexual activity began showing I had to turn the movie off and try to explain to my grandsons, the best I could for their age, that this is not appropriate behavior for boys and girls the age of the actors. Sorry that I am having to say these things to you but you DID ask, right? I hope you truely wanted my honest opinion.Thanks.Jane"
5,A great metaphor!,"One of the movies I recommend in my practice as family therapist, whenever suits. Great also as entertainment, leaving the subconcious mind does the work to suggest other ways to see life - to live life. Berenice de Lara, Family Therapist"
4,good message,"I thought this was a very good movie with a great message-life is unpredictable,you should live it to the fullest. Also,I believe it should have been nominated for best picture,but,the Academy usually doesnt honor good movies."
4,Entertaining and Thought-provoking,"This is one of the most clever, original films of 1998. Like Jim Carrey's The Truman Show, this film explores our world's current social situation with a television show, but instead of making a relatively sad, negative point of view of things it makes it an inspiring, hope-filled satire with lots of light black comedy. The premise of the black and white mixing with the color is ingenious, and it makes for direct symbolism. But, there are many true flaws in the film, involving its ignorance of its own script and an ending which takes too much time to finish, and finishes the old-fashioned, predictable, easy way which the film itself preaches is the wrong way. At the end, the movie's important message is that having a dangerous, eventful life makes your soul free, and having a slow, uneventful life makes you have a simple, black & white soul."
2,No thanks. This film dragged on...,"I got this DVD because of the great reviews it was receiving. I felt sorely disappointed. For me, this film dragged on and is not really my sort of film. I can see why it appeals to the American market though it tends to get onto the cheesy side.If you're thinking about getting this film, I'd suggest you read the plot and decide whether you just think that'd be interesting or if you think it's a fantastic idea. Your decision there is likely to produce the outcome of whether you'll like it or not.It's not a film for me but it sure did impress a lot of the Americans."
3,"Have Sex, Change Color!",This movie had a great cast but the story in Pleasantville was very predictable. Everyone who has sex gets colorized. The intent of the movie is clear and it slams Christians and family values as living in a black and white world. Minorities are totally missing from this movie. Recommendation is to see for special effects and the energetic young cast but the message and story are predictable and unsatisfying. Another example of caucasian left wing politics prevalent in moviemaking that really does not have a clue about minority issues.
1,DISSAPOINTING AND DISTURBING,"Well I thought this might be good as I watch old black and white movies, tv shows ect....But it was not. The thought of going back in time to the fifties is OK. I realize that they needed to spice up the plot a little to appeal to a modern audience; but they chose to use casual sex, masturbation, and added a racist or racial overtone. These choices did not make it a good movie at all.In addition to the crummy plot I was somewhat disturbed by the black and white town and people vs. the colored objects and people. It's hard to describe my feelings here I guess. But now whenever I see a commercial (or any video clip) that changes from black and white to color I am reminded of this horrible movie. I would not recommend this movie.This was a long boring movie and casting Don Knots could not save this movie. This plot is best viewed in a shorter half hour show like The Twilight Zone."
3,A splash of color.,"Pleasantville starring Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon is a good comedy/drama but I was expecting so much more. The two leads are so talented and Joan Allen and Jeff Daniels bring realism to their roles. The problem I have with this film is the slow pace, it feels too long and dragged out and the black and white is kind of distracting when color is introduced halfway into the film. Interesting flick but poorly excuated."
3,Good but nothing more,"although the script is dead good, the visual effects and the photography are excellent, the acting is very good - although one should explain me what it is about reese, nothing more than silverstone with a bigger chin- there is something that keeps it from being great, saw it once but wouldn't buy it though."
3,"Alright, but some things don't make sense.","It was a pretty good movie but, some things were hard to understand. The mom didnt know what sex was but she has kids.????????? I did feel though that it was another world."
3,The chortomagnafeldic simulation was symbolicly theorescent.,"The phenominal intromagnetic colourizational effects collaberated with the high magnitude sound quality to produce a film which displays qualities both captivating and intriguing. Miss Witherspoon charicterized the role of the daughter quite charmingly, allthough I must admit to being shocked at some of her morrals, ( hint: That scene in the car...)"
5,"Pleasantly surprising, a light moral","Pleasantville uses an interesting story line to project a social commentary on the narrowmindednsess of small towns and the lack of color of biggotry. Our heros deal with their own personal issues as well as educating the community in a flowing story-line which never loses sight of the fact that this story was meant to entertain. While the precept of the movie could have been handled simply, it progressed smoothly and with meaning and movement."
3,Excellent art direction,"Lighthearted, amusing comedy which becomes unnecessarily menacing at the end when evil characters start becoming racist; because race issue is resolved so quickly and without much thought, these racist overtones are somewhat disturbing. Art direction, however, is excellent. Sound on the DVD is o.k. Great Fiona Apple video directed by P.T. Anderson is included in the Extra Features. Another very good New Line disc in another very crappy WB's case."
2,"Concept was pleasant, ultimate theme - unpleasant","As a whole, the concept of the film and the visuals were great! But there was a serious lack of continuity and just far-fetchedness.For instance, we would believe that Pleasantville had no outside world. Then who did they lose the basketball game to?Even more curious, Maguire's character who so longed for family at the film's start, was not concerned at all that his TV mom would leave his TV dad. In fact, he smiled about it. This was supposed to be growth in him.Somehow marital fidelity and sexual purity ... is as dark and foreboding as book-burning according to the screenwriter... The film could've had something to say..."
4,Pleasantville,I was very satisfied with the quality and the timely manner in which I received my movie. It seems that all of the local video stores are going out of business and I was excited to add this one to my collection.
3,"Entertaining, but not harmless.","Pleasantville has a good script, but is loaded with Hollywood values and self-righteous ""truths"". The main premise seems to be that a moral life must be ""colorless"" and empty of joy. And, of course, all religious people are mean-spirited thugs. Just once, I'd like to see a big studio movie where a person with a relationship to Christ actually practices what Christ preached! I might have a long wait for that. Parents beware!"
4,must see,"I like the part when the black and white turns into colour ,I also like the words what are used.I like the way the person who plays Bud tackles racist behaviour.I AM STUDYING THIS FILM FOR G.C.S.E .byC.D.T BAILEY"
1,Things are black and white for Gary Ross,"This file should really be subtitled, ""Let's pretend the Sixties actually made things better."" While this movie is a thrill to watch and the story is not too bad, one never loses the feeling that he or she is being lectured. Ross fails to heed his own admonition about black and white. The fifties are painted as an illusion at best or an oppressive, fascist society at worst. But don't worry; a little free sex will fix everything. Of course they throw a little book burning for legitimacy. I've got the sequel, ""Return to Pleasantville."" Good old Bud can come back to the town to find the town populated by poor single mothers with a thriving abortion facility, the malt shop now a STD clinic and all this in brilliant color.I understand that Pleasantville was not intended to be an Isben play, but a little more depth to the fifties characters would have greatly improved the film.BTW, the Civil Rights Movement started in the Fifties."
1,theres nothing pleasant about trash,"This movie shows exactly just how this country got so messed up to begin with. The plot (if you can call it that) is two kids who get sent to the perfect world, and in a matter of days manage to totaly destroy everything good about it. This movie was cleary nothing but Liberal Hollywood lies. This movie seems to be aimed at younger children yet it permotes sex before marriage and other imperfections making them look harmless. After seeing this movie I am lead to believe that there is no hope for Hollywood, their lack of realism manages to retard them yet again. Parents please this is not the trash we should stride for as humans, help your kids by keeping them away from films like this."
1,morally repugnant,"This film, while masking itself as cute and harmless, attempts in its own subtle way to completely trash and impune traditional moral values. Unfortunately this film does not show the consequences of Pleasantville's new found freedom. Broken homes, shattered lives and a society doomed to disaster. Dont be fooled. This isnt a harmless fun flick. Watch the film then ask yourself, ""Are these people really better off?"""
4,Thinking about the feel good factor,"Originally I bought the DVD expecting a non existent story but interested in the special effects the film uses to mix colour with black and white. However you can view this film in two ways. It does have a simplistic far fetched storyline, two 90's teenagers are transported back in time to become stuck in Pleasantville, a 1950's show where it never rains, there is no crime and most emotions are never explored and disasters never happen. But scratch beneath the surface and you find a story of people scared of what they don't understand and breeding violence through ignorance and mass hysteria. Jeff Daniels plays his character with the same brilliant awkwardness as he did in ""terms of endearment""and the film is well acted with some very humorous scenarios, and is film is worth watching over and over. As with many DVD's if you have a multi region machine then but a region 1 copy."
5,Pleasantville,So great to have this film on Bluray. Ggreat transition from BW to color. And ... a wonderful message to boot!Exceptional dealer as well.
1,"Piece of ""Art""? Hardly!","I went into this movie with an open mind ... I had heard so many good things about it.What a complete waste of film! Calling it a piece of ""art"" is utter nonsense ... the whole thing seemed like a senior film project ... senior in high school!...for all you people who think this is one of the best movies ever made, why don't you go watch Jurassic Park or Titanic ... I'm sure those are at the top of your list as well.The one star is for the two good things in the movie: William H. Macy and the special effects."
1,This film made no sense...,"I assume this film had a message, but I had no idea what it was. Color, then black-and-white... Joan Allen having an affair with Jeff Daniels, who plays a mildly-retarded malt-shop employee... Mr. Furley talking through the TV set, and so on. A lot of moviegoers liked it. A lot of critics liked it. I thought it was a complete waste of time."
1,Terrible!,This movie is pure propaganda and was very twisted to get a very obvious liberal point of view out.
5,pleasantville,podrian conseguirla con subtitulos en español? do you have this title whith spanish subtitles?
5,One of a kind,"A wonderful and unique movie.It successfully takes the very difficult stand that complexity is more desirable than simplicity and predictability and endless ""pleasantness"".It also has wonderful acting, and delightful images all the way through.Don't miss this one. Really."
3,"Very good, but could've been better","The effects were great, Witherspoon's and Joan Allen's performances were brilliant. However, is there anything more annoying than a saintly person who has ALL the answers to ALL of life's mysteries? That is what is presented in this film in the main character. The only time it has ever worked was Yoda. Excise his all-knowing, preachy goodness and you have a great, incisive film. His character lobs off a star and a half."
4,Add Color to your Life!,"A town completely in black and white. Safe. Unexciting. Mundane. That's smallville. However, strange things begin to happen when feelings are introduced. Things that get the town up in arms and into a fight to maintain the status quo! For me this movie is a love story. Difficult to explain without giving it away. Lets call it a date movie. You will enjoy it."
5,quirky cool movie on the times,"i thought this movie was very nice and cool,they were excellent on really showing the life and times at that time and it was very funny i would have to admit.the movie just keeps you drawn into it the more you watch it and they did a good job on the movie.i still cant get over the part when they first get sucked into the tv and the mom feeds the daughter that breakfast."
3,Corelle Dinnerware,We purchased Corelle dinnerware set and my wife didn't like the pattern after she saw it in person. The color didn't match the picture on the web site. It was a shade or two lighter. We sent it back and even had to pay for shipping. That ran us $30.
1,review,"The set arrived with two damaged pieces. Promptly, the damages were reported; however, the replacement pieces have not arrived."
2,It's a sequel. Literally!,"This effort, ""Gates of Noon"", is almost everything ""Chase the Morning"" was. In fact, replace a few names, reheat for a few minutes, and you have the same book.In both books, Steve Fisher is a Shipping Expert. He's a hollow, empty man who traded everything worthwhile to succeed in the business world. Then he stumbles across a gateway to the past, called the Spiral.Something important of his gets taken by denizens of the Spiral. Steve chases after them with help from others dwelling in the Spiral. Big sea battle, even bigger land battle, Steve wins, claims the lady fair, and on to a new and better life.It was an excellent read the first time around. Reading the same plot again with different names inserted is just plain tedious. Michael Scott Rohan needs an infusion of imagination."
4,A good yarn - makes me wonder what's around that next corner,"Michael Scott Rohan has created a beguiling world of mystery and subterfuge. As Stephen Fisher tries desperately to transport an irrigation system to the island of Bali, he comes up against some formidable and fascinating characters.With a little help from his friends, including his shapely ex, a maori warrior and a sorceror called Ape, he battles the forces of evil to complete his mission.The storyline rocks along and the characters are powerful and imaginative. The religious and mystical themes are well managed to give the story depth.The only real failing I found was the author's errors in dealing with his maori character. He calls white men pakahes, instead of pakehas. His cloak is from the Tanaraki, instead of Taranaki and he calls women vahines instead of wahines. Little errors, but enough to grate on those who know (ie: the 4m or so people who are NZ residents or ex-pats.).Good value for money and well worth a read."
4,review BEST OF CLAIRE,This is a collection of 15 songs sung in Tagalog by Claire dela Fuente. Any collector of Philippine local compositions would want to include this one.
4,A boy in the Siege of Leningrad,"I don't know but, given what I know of the conditions in Leningrad and Russia in general during that time period, it seems kind of unrealistic that only one character died during this story, and that character a fairly minor one. That's hardly a deal-breaker though, and Whelan is able to cover a lot of ground in this short novel, describing the suffering of the Leningraders and the adversity they faced, and the ways they fought back, without being graphic."
3,Three track EP great for English Beat fans!,"This, I believe, is actually a 1988 realease from I.R.S./A&M records which features three tracks - SAVE IF FOR LATER 3:35 (Album track from 'Special Beat Service) DOORS OF YOUR HEART 5:49 (12""mix, previously unavailable on any album) and BEST FRIEND 2:59 (Recorded Live at the Opera House, Boston, November 19, 1982)"
4,"a double shot of their baby, love","As most Resident cultists know, legend has it that the Warner Brothers tape was assembled by the creole kids under the guidance of Captain Beefheart and sent to the said Brothers in hopes of it being accepted as their first commercial disc. Instead, Warner's returned it to them in care of RESIDENTS. Hence....More than 35 years later, the ocular one(s?) has revisited this original tape and remixed it into a thick, opaque brew. The result is more energetic and dense than the usual fare (if usual can apply) and at times is fairly mesmerizing. If there is any fault here, it's that this density seems to overwhelm any underlying bits of coherence that one imagines of the original piece. However, this may not be fault at all and like the energy jazz of that time period merely require repeated servings to digest its numerous ingredients.Time will tell if this piece indicates a renewal of inspiration or mere layering of repetition. Or both."
2,"Sentimental fantasy that doesn't follow its own rules,","which is a huge no-no for fantasy. The characters are not developed; they come from the reader's stock of stereotypcial caricatures. The story is completely predictable, esp. if you happen to look at the photographs before you read all the way to the end. It is not a completely unenjoyable read, but I would advise you to pick this one up at a used bookstore."
5,If you love romance and adventure this is the book for you.,"Leprechauns is a wonderful touching book. The characters seem so real,and each word paints a beautiful picture. Mickey and Princess Jessica struggle to rise above their families ideas of the way they should live. Their love is so powerful it makes you stop and realize that love is strong enough to survive any obstacles thrown at you. I recommend this book to anyone who believes in romance,and happy everafter."
2,"Very uncomfortable, instructions not very good",I found this to be very uncomfortable and the instructions that I received were very limited. It's too bad because I really wanted to be able to do shoulder and/or headstands. I guess I have to do them the old fashioned way...go to class and get proper instructions from a certified instructor.
3,Harnessing Autodesk LDDT2i,"The overall organization is quite good..., however, if you have been using LDD for a while and have accessed the online help to learn the program, you may find much similarity in syntax. If you are new to using LDD, then it is worth the price of the book. Keep in mind though, if you need to pick up the overall working mechanism of this LDD software and civil design in general in a rather short period of time, you best bet may be going to an authorized learning center. (No, I don't work for anyone of them.)"
4,Highly usefull,"I have 14 years of part time 3rd party ACAD apps. It gets the out of the box program configured for use, teaches you basics. The LDD help is not very good for this (i.e I spent 5 hours going down dead ends, looking for menus not loaded etc). The book guides you through set up and creating lines, lots, surfaces, alignments and grading, tied into surveying. It is not a civil engineering text book, hence be prepared to spend a lot of time working on engineering problems to do small things in the program (yes, your bridge may end up 4 inches above the road alignemnt if you are not on your toes). I really wish LDD had engineering tools built in like terra model. Go get an ACAD class if you have the $1500(I do not work for them either), at least buy the coursware for $60 on amazon."
4,A wonderful classic,"I love reminiscing about watching and enjoying this movie as a child. Viewing it now, I find a different and delightful humor that I hadn't conceived in my early years. Great fun for the whole family."
5,the FLIGHT still holds up!,Fantastic film in 1986 and just as awesome in 2009. One of the best Disney live action films.
4,FUN,Such a fun movie for kids. I use to watch it when I was a kid and bought it for my five year old. She loved it!
5,flight of the navigator,i had seen the movie before. i found it to be funny suspenceful and very intertaining my 4 year old nephew fell in love with it and we had to watch it 3 times in a row. its good for all ages
4,A movie for the kids,It seems a little dated - but nevertheless this DVD provides reasonably solid entertainment for the kids movie library. Bla Bla Bla (20 words required)
5,Flight of the Navigator - An A+ movie,"Flight of the Navigator is a movie like no other. For a movie of its time, the special effects are amazing. It is for any age viewer, and its replay value is endless! When I was younger I watched Flight of the Navigator all the time. I hope it will be released again, especially for DVD. It is worth every effort!"
4,The Flight of the Navigator,"One of my favorite movies for years, this movie brings out the importance of family and living our lives by enjoying each minute, never taking anything for granted. Recommended for family viewing and for older children."
4,Flight of the Imagination,"Wonderful movie for kids and adults alike. It's a kids' movie, but grownups will enjoy this one with as much child-like enthusiasm. Two hours of innocent fun & adventure! Wish I could find a few to buy for friends and self."
4,A good time in a different time,"I first saw this movie long ago and far away when my daughters were young. I found the approach of the movie to an interesting theme novel and entertaining. The story line and acting were simple, but entertaining with some nice moments of comedy and touching personal relationships. It had a nice balance of plot and special effects (such as they were) that made the movie enjoyable for both kids and adults (for me at least). After many years my daughters and I talked about old movies we had watched and Navigator popped up as one of our favorites. We found it, I bought it, and a good time was had by all."
5,Childhood classic,"I first watched this movie as a kid in the 80's, and practically wore the old vhs copy out back then. It was great to find it on dvd and relive the memories all over again. This movie has a little bit of something for everyone. Also of note is the pioneering CG special effects used in this film.. (the environment mapping on the spaceship). Groundbreaking for the time..."
5,laughter's the best medicine,"Excellent movie. My husband, myself and our teen daughter loved this movie. Luckily I was fortunate enough to purchase it here on VHS when it was still available. I would like to see it on DVD also. Like the previous reviewers, I found myself wanting ""The Dark Crystal"". A while back, it too was not available. I wrote an email to Jim Henson studios asking if they planned to release it. I was told ""NO"", but lo and behold, a few months later I bought it here and on DVD at that. Send e-mails to Disney asking if they plan to re-release it. It can't hurt."
5,Great Family Movie!,"This is such a classic..Great Family movie, even if it is from 1978. Even kept my 3 year old's attention at certain times, but my 5 year old really got into it. A must have for your disney collection!"
4,Very nice,They did not clean up the print much (it at all) but the movie is still fun to watch and my kids age 7-12 all enjoyed it. Only my 7 year old has asked to watch it again.
4,THANKYOU,"THIS IS A NOTHER GREAT MOVIE, AND MY SON LIKED IT ALSO , FOR IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY , THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR GETTING THIS TOO HIM ON TIME . LEATHERNECK USMC BACE"
3,"Kind of like a hippo, but with feathers","In this 1986 Disney flick, Veronica Cartwright (the whiny lady from 'Alien') played mother to a child kidnapped by a robotic space ship. Despite her best efforts, the plot sinks to an irritating low when the robot alien ship scans the child's mind and suddenly becomes Pee-wee Herman. Is any more commentary required? This is bad 1980's family movie-fluff, like Short Circuit, but more obnoxious. Watch it for sentimental value or for an ironic laugh at Disney's half-hearted critique of the xenophobia inherent in American foreign policy. Otherwise, entertain your kids with something more entertaining, like Veronica Cartwright's brilliant 1979 film 'Alien.'"
5,best kid sci-fi movie ever,"I saw this movie some 20 years ago when it was released to the movie theaters. The cast selection was good so was the script. I have bought this movie an am glad that no dialogue was edited out (unlike some other movies I've seen.) It would ruin the quality of the movie if the Disney censored some of the words from this film. I always like a good science fiction film, but don't be dubbing in or out any words. I love Joey Cramer's acting, he is a natural in this film. Joey Cramer was great in a 1987 movie called The Stone Fox with Buddy Ebsen, look for it when it comes out on DVD."
5,"Oh wow, great movie.",Me and my 7 year old son watch this movie. I saw this movie when I was a kid and I still love this movie. I'm glad my son and I had a good time watching this movie.
5,love it,The dvd arrived quickly and in great shape. i love this classic movie so was happy to share it with my son for Christmas.
4,4 For family,2 for acting and 3 for story Still an enjoyable family movie which may seem a little outdated when watched today.
5,Family Fun,"This was a very fun movie and still is today. The film itself was very grainy at the beginning. You could tell that there was something crawling on the camera lens. I don't know if there would be any difference if it was transferred to Blu-ray, but as a movie buff, I would still like to see that happen.Overall, Flight of the Navigator was funny, adventurous, and mind bending for any kid and/or adult out there."
4,good story but the language wasn't too good for small kids,I was shocked at the language. I guess we have always watched an edited version on TV. My kids had loved the show when they were younger so I bought it for the grandkids to watch and was surprised to find there were several cuss words that weren't in the TV version. Nothing you don't hear on TV today but still might not be something some people would want their 5 year olds to hear. Cute story though and good special effects.
3,"For once, the MOVIE was better!","This is one case in which the MOVIE was definitely better than the book that inspired it...not that the book isn't an entertaining read! The film's pre-credits sequence is referred to briefly in the beginning of the book, but death by electric shock in the tub is easily more inspired than death by karate-chop! In the film, Bond's manhood is threatened by a laser beam; in the book, it's a circular saw. In the film, Goldfinger puts Ft.Knox to sleep with poison gas; in the book, it's the town's tainted water supply. In the film, Goldfinger wants to blow up the fort; in the book, he actually wants to rob it. In the film, both Oddjob and Goldfinger die clever and inventive deaths; in the book, only Oddjob's demise is really unique. But read it anyway! If the description of the meal Bond eats in the Miami restaurant at the beginning doesn't make your mouth actually water, I don't know what will!"
3,Bond books get much better,"It is interesting to note how Flemings use of pacing and flow starts to improve substantially from Thunderball on. The Blofield trilogy are incredible page turners. Goldfinger is not. Maybe it is because much of the story is a let down compared to the amazing filmed version. But aside from the interesting characters, the narrative here is ponderous and slow and you are constantly waiting for some action. And waiting way to long..."
3,Movie better than the book.,"The audio CD arrived quickly and in A-1 condition. I was very surprised that the charactor of James Bond in the book is not the sauve guy in the movies. I like the story line in the movie better. Still, the difference was interesting. Don't expect to find Sean Connery in the books."
2,"Skip the Book, Watch the Movie","Having seen and enjoyed the film version of Goldfinger, I thought I might like the novel too. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The novel is very different from the film, and, quite frankly, sucks. The novel is too far-fetched, the characters are not likeable, and the plot is filled with nonsensical events. Don't bother reading this - just watch the film.You have been warned."
1,Borefinger,"KCJI enjoyed the James Bond movies and thought I'd read one of the books - big disappointment. Lots of dull discussion including a lengthy blow-by-blow call of a golf game. Now golf is tedious to begin with, but to read about every shot in a spy novel is especially dreadful."
3,Bond Fans,"I love the Bond series. And I am reading the books sequentially. I just finished Ian Fleming's GOLDFINGER. If you like the series, you will enjoy this book. It's written in typical Fleming style. I love his character descriptions and his keen observations. As in other books, there are some cultural references that we might find wildly old fashioned if not worse. Hey! It was the 60s after all. I can't wait to read another James Bond tale."
3,More Bronze than Gold,"This is the rare exception were the movie is far superior to the book. The cast of characters remain the same, but the plot is razor-thin and Bond is unusually dull for his standards. The best thing is Flemming's tight prose, which always lend a natural forward movement that is greatly appreciated."
3,Really just a comma.,"A mediocre effort. The 50 min. track never quite succeeds. Minimimalism is a difficult genre to implement without being too repetitive and boring; Coleclough seems to have fallen into this trap.This work is reminiscent of some of Harold Budd's pieces, but definitely not as polished as Budd's. The first track is nearly an hour of Coleclough tapping sparse, random, icey piano keys. Maybe if the piece were only a half hour it would have worked better. (The original version as released on vinyl was only 17 min. I have not heard that version, but I'm willing to bet it's superior.) The track creates an interesting enough atmosphere, we just don't want to spend an hour there. Track two, a completely different sounding 17 min. remix by Colin Potter, is actually much better than its source.It's an ok piece, but I can't say that I recommend it..."
5,Excellent Book,"I have used this book back in my college days. I am amazed to see such a low rating on this book. This is one of the best books on complex analysis.Mind you this is a Graduate Text in Mathematics. So it is intended to cover lot of ground using clear logical path. I agree to some extent that this book does not have lot of examples but a GTM is supposed to be like that. The way I used/read this book is to supplement it with other books on the topic. The proofs of theorems in this book are complete without any errors.If you are a graduate student and want to learn complex analysis, this is the best book available out there."
4,A good book for a beginning graduate student.,"I used this book in graduate school to help prepare for one of my Ph.D. qualifying exams. The text discusses beginning theory for functions of one complex variable. There are many examples, and the proofs are clearly stated."
1,Waste of Money,This DVD is completely a waste of money. There are very poor graphics and just regular men. There is no sexual acts or even the actors touching themselves. You would be better off buying something else!
4,Overall review,Book was exactly as described. Very good communication and very fast shipment. Would highly reccomend
3,Get another book too,"I recommend ""Retirement Nightmare"" ISBN: 1573927961 . To avoid a guardianship in the State of Florida, and other states, should be of paramount importance. Find out how to protect yourself and your loved ones with alternatives: health care surrogate, durable power of attorney, mediation and more. Consider that if you leave your parents to fend for themselves, and ignore the deterioration associated with aging, a guardian can gain a guardianship over them and their assets, without informing you. That guardianship will nullify the most meticulous of plans. To really cover your aging parents, make sure they create a ""Pre-need"" guardianship and name someone they trust, this is the only way predators in the retirement homes will not be able to force guardianship on them. Also create an irrevocable trust."
3,some contact numbers wrong,Basically a great book. Unravels the confusion that you face when trying to plan care for your parents. But I found a few of the phone contact numbers to be wrong. For instance: on page 157: The Transit Hotline Number. This turns out NOT to be a number for consumers but for agencies.Making your way through the social service maze is hard enough and unfortunately putting wrong numbers in the book doesn't help. Makes you wonder if they didn't check them before publishing.
1,Leading pianists offer greater enjoyment.,"Chopin's Etudes are widely regarded as among the most difficult works in the piano repertoire, and are a challenge even for accomplished concert pianists. If the performer cannot overcome the technical challenges, the musicality of these Etudes can be lost, and the listener will hear only technical struggles. My personal preference is for the flawless technique and interpretive mastery of such esteemed artists asMaurizio Pollini,Nikolai Lugansky, andMurray Perahia. It is only when performed by such superb musicians that the Chopin Etudes can be appreciated as some of the finest piano compositions of the 19th century. Nonetheless, I hope Mr. Rusnak will continue his admirable efforts, and will grow into a pianist of the stature to which he aspires."
5,Transcendental performance,"I am a Russian musician, and I believe that musical etudes of European romanticist couldn`t be expressed better than in the performance of John Rusnak. Unique and yet universal understanding of it smashed my accustomed perception of classic art. There was a strange feeling of images coming alive and dragging me into this world of thoroughly hidden emotions, listening to CD I had a ""creepy sensation"" of Fryderyk Chopin himself telling out in musical passages his life confessions...and there was no choice for escape!!! Great..."
5,Chopin: Etudes,"The Chopin: Etudes is masterfully done. John Rusnak plays each piece effortlessly. It's obvious this pianist understands the intricate styling of Chopin - almost as if he studied with the master himself. Each piece has it's own unique character and the moods are captured perfectly. This CD will leave the listener wondering if it has been edited at all and well worth the price, especially tracks #3,4,6,8,12,14,19,23,24 which are performed exceptionally well."
5,"Deserts Hummmmmmm, heathy? Yeah, Awesome!!!","The cooking book, ¡The Healthy Table¡ has been a great success to all my friends who didn¡t know how to cook¡ I have bough my friends this book because of someone¡s recommendation. And it sure was a great recommendation because I have been eating healthy and it does not take long to prepare each dish. I love the book because the dishes vary one from the other, and I won¡t get bored eating the same type of food. In addition the deserts are hummmm!!! Delicious, the Coconut pudim is just fantastic. If you love sweets, and you can¡t afford to gain any more weight, I¡d strongly recommend that you run to the bookstore and grab on of this magical healthy book."
5,Now for something really new.....,"This CD really brings out the great talent in Lynne between writing her own original songs and music. Great band to back her up as well. I would definitely recommend this CD to everyone - going to be the next up and coming big artist alongside Sheryl Crow, Alanis, and Michelle Branch...."
4,Universal String Trimmer Strap,"Recently purchased the Arnold Universal String Trimmer Strap and really like it. Using my string trimmer for awhile made my arms very tired. With this strap, the pressure is off my arms as my shoulder carries the weight of the trimmer. It is very comfortable and I recommend this product."
4,Trimmer strap,The strap does everything that I expected for an economical price. It was delevered promptly and in good condition. It should work fine for my applications.
4,does the job,"I bought this for my Poulan Pro and it fit just fine. Needed a strap for the new weed eater and this is simply just that, a strap that attaches to the shaft of the weedeater. Works fine."
4,Does the job...,"I purchased this because I tend to hunch over when using my weedeater. By using the strap, it sure saves wear and tear on my back. Easy to install. Easy to use. I use one of the car seat belt protectors where it hangs on my shoulder and it's much more comfortable."
3,get what you pay for?,"This is made from the absolutely cheapest materials available (in China, of course) but it does the job as far as supporting my trimmer. Of course it has no padded cushion but I made one by wrapping an old towel around the strap and holding it on with some snazzy red duct tape."
3,Works,"Kind of a cheap strap, but it does the job. No recommended for commercial applications, but for around the yard it will be fine."
5,"Hella 009906011 Ford F-150 Upgrade Radiator Grille with 12V/35W Xenon Driving Light (complete kit)""","Great Product, Great Price, Quick Shipping, easy install, instructions could be a more clear. The ballasts do not fit where the instructions say, but there is plenty of wire to work with. Lights are extremely bright and really light up the road, I used a seperate switch so I control when they are on. Really looks great and I get alot of complements."
5,WOW!!,"2005 F150/5.4/K&N; cold/ 3"" Flowmaster/ Hypertech MAX.........This light kit is bay far the bes investment when it comes to lights. I have been tinkering with fog, driving lights, headlamp bulbs for almost 2 years and this by far is in a league all by itself. There are so bright that I may have to do some kind of mod to lower the aim for the oncoming drivers. I have stock height, but went 235 to a 265-70-17.All in all so fantastic I am getting another for the F150 2008 I also have!!! Enjoy."
1,"Oh my gosh, I've found some erotica that totally turns me off!","Curiosity bit me on the butt with this one and I couldn't even finish reading it. But while it's not my cup of tea, it might be someone's. In a nutshell - if you are into hardcore humiliation, slavery, physical punishment, sexual torture and dehumanization - then this may float your boat. I on the other hand will go screaming off in the other direction."
3,not enough pay-off,"This book started out all right (once the two main characters met) and the erotica had the potential to be very hot. But then... it wasn't. Just waiting, and waiting, and waiting for the pay off. Tell me, does it count as a sex book when neither of the main characters are getting any? A couple of secondary characters provided erotic relief, but I wasn't reading for them.Without wading into murky moral territory I can say that I appreciated the sentiment, but not the execution."
3,Limited plot but some nice erotic moments.,"I give this 3 stars as its better than average for the genre. The plot is pretty light, Maita is a serious control freak and bare back rider in the rodeo. She meets Kade, a rodeo livestock contractor with a side of training women as subs. The owner of the ranch that Maita works on starts pressuring her when Kade shows interest and she quits. Both Kade (his mother was a prostitute and a prospers one) and Maita (she was set up by an ""uncle"" as a kiddy port star) are somewhat gratuitous to the plot which is pretty thin. Good erotic scenes though."
1,Obscure and too expensive,"As a professor of ecommerce I think that the authors have unnecesarily obscured a subject that deserves a better prose and a more logical thread of reasoning.Theirs is a text written for other academicians and contributors to the HBR, not for students, unless they are candidates to a very high academic degree. ..."
4,FOURTEEN HOURS,"Really taut and well-done. Richard Baseheart is the potential jumper with an overbearing, neurotic Agnes Moorehead mother, a distant, alcoholic father, and an ex-girlfriend, Barbara Bel Geddes, whom he jilted because he knew he could ""never make her happy"". I wonder what his problem could be? Paul Douglas is good-as-usual as the traffic cop recruited into the role of crisis negotiator. Nicely skewers the ghoulish media spectacle that inevitably coalesces, but doesn't yell at us soulless masses in the way ACE IN THE HOLE does. Vignettes that spring up amongst the gawkers aren't terribly compelling, but still keep things from getting monotonous. Crisp NYC location shooting blends really well with the excellent model and matte work. Grace Kelly's and Ossie Davis' debuts. John Cassavettes, Brian Keith, and Janice Rule amongst the extras. Bel Geddes would be blacklisted till VERTIGO. 8/10"
4,Surprise,This black and white film is unusually good. The movie is a real surprise. I did not know the movie existed until I watched it. The film has several famous actors and actresses near the begining of their careers. Grace Kelly's performance was unexpected. Some great acting and suspense.
2,Cheaper at HEB,I had originally bought this pan because I thought I would not b able to find in my local store. But I did and it was cheaper. The pan does the job but whatever.
4,great imagination,"My 5 year old sons loves this book, but I must say that some of the other children I have read this book to didn't like it and made them think too much about monsters. My son doesn't get freaked out easily and can appreciate a book with a lot of imagination. The grandfather helps his grandson build a monster trap after hearing a ""Monster Theatre show"" on an old time radio. Each night they find no monsters so each night they find more stuff laying around the shop to improve on the monster trap, until there is a wonderful monster trap and lots of monsters. Not a real long story, around 25 pages of reading and a sentence to a small paragraph per page. Illustrations are very nice. A lot to talk about."
5,wonderful artwork and great story,this book is so appealing I could read it over and over. always something new to point out to a child. JK
5,"Beautiful, fun book","I had the pleasure of meeting Dean Morrissey at Boskone 45 and fell in love with his art - bought all his books. The illustrations in Monster Trap are excellent - my favorite being the two page spread of the ""monster trap."" I saw that painting in real life and it blew me away. The story is delightful and I would recommend this book to anyone - young or old."
5,Wonderful Book,My three year old is captivated by this book. We have read it every night for the past two months. The pictures are beautiful and vivid and the story reads well and is very entertaining. A great addition to any collection
4,Another Visual Gem from Dean Morrissey,"This book, much like others by Dean Morrissey, proves to be great reading for my children. My son loves the pictures and sleeps much easier now knowing how cute monsters can be."
4,Seattle's First Band On The Moon,"SCM was too far-out to be aptly described in words, to be commercially successful-- and, ultimately, to reside on this earth. Their live shows were a swirling trip, with pulsating amoebae projected onscreen and the lead female singer dressed as a tree; no drugs were necessary. This particular album captured that feeling perhaps the best of any of their outings, with their cover of (appropriately) ""2,000 Light Years From Home"" as the major highlight.Perhaps, from a musical standpoint, it's good that they never made the ""big time,"" as we'd likely have seen a number of pale imitators. SCM was truly one-of-a-kind."
5,Outstanding and unique neo-psychedelia,"By all that is holy! How is it that an album so ground-breaking, so mind-blowingly brilliant has ended up out of print, with merely a few ragged used copies floating about? Is there no justice in this world? This is an example of '90s music that we should be putting atop a pedestal, resplendent for all to see (hear?). The music on this disc still sounds as impressively innovative and fresh as the first time i heard it. There is a dark, interstellar vibe running throughout this album, something which sort of ties it thematically together. It is at times very upbeat, other times nearly somnolent, sometimes completely space-tastic! It is a masterpiece of modern rock that transcends that genre without even trying. This humble reviewer HIGHLY recommends it!"
5,I'm going to get these back in print! Can you help?,"I'm launching a letter campaign to get these books back. It is ridiculous what people are spending for a book that should be available to young girls and old alike. Libraries can't keep these books in stock! If you want to help me this is what I'm doing: I will mail a letter a day to the Ballantine/Fawcet press asking that they publish The Secret of the Unicorn Queen Series. I will say that there is a genuine need for these books and that they will sell. In order to prove the high demand for these books it would be great to have other people send in letters too. Anyone who is interested can e-mail me (it's a hotmail account with my name) or just write and mail a letter. This shouldn't be a herculean labor, these books are marketable and will sell, the publisher can't go wrong. (I love the cover art too-Rowena is brilliant!)"
5,Sara's Review,"This is one of the most brilliant and inspiring books ever,that can really capture your imagination and bring the story to life.I thought it was a really unique idea but one that could just be crazy enough to happen so you don't think 'no way, that'd never happen!'when the story of how sheila fell through Dr.Reit's time machine and landed in a parallel world is relaid.The characters are all really fascinating due to the fact they're all really tough warriors but are gentle people at heart.I gaurentee by the end of this book you'll still be wanting more."
5,still holds up,i hadnt watched splash in over 15yrs and i wanted my grandson to see it. i had forgotten how funny and poignett it was. what a great love story. tom hanks cant lose he is at his innocent best. along with john candy it makes this movie a hit. aftrer watching it 2x's w/ my 9yr old grandson i found him in the middle of the night watching it again. that dose'nt happen often w/ a kid who loves wrestling above all elese..
3,"Kind of a period piece, but good","Unnecessarily profane. Flash or two of nudity, handled well. Dialog sometimes crude, suggestive but not too lewd unless you know Swedish. Nice story, not for pre-teens... or teens at all IMO.I was proud to spy the WTC's Twin Towers on the DVD case label of this edition. I hope they keep producing it in this era of post-9/11 political correctness.Period piece: John Candy, young Tom Hanks, pre-Kill Bill Daryl Hannah, WTC, ""sexy"" dialog. Worth having."
4,80s Classic,"Ok, this is basically all you need to know: Daryl Hannah is a mermaid. That right there is reason enough to own this movie. She's also wet through a good portion of the movie. Oh yeah, did I mention she was a mermaid?"
3,Mermaid mesmerizes young man...,"Allen Bauer (Tom Hanks) is a fairly successful produce merchant who loses his girlfriend prior his friends wedding and in grief he withdraws to Cape Cod. When he arrives to Cape Cod he falls into the ocean in a similar accident that he experienced 20 years ago as a child. In the accident he losses his wallet as he is saved by a Mermaid, which he is completely unaware of. A couple of days later Allen gets a phone call from the police regarding a young woman who has been found wandering around naked outside the Statue of Liberty with his wallet. Splash is an entertaining film that unfortunately has some melodramatic moments that lowers the cinematic experience."
3,"VERY GOOD FILM, BUT ALTERED DVD VERSION SINKS THIS 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION!","20th Anniversary Edition!.......Well it's got a good transfer and a few interesting extras, but what it is missing is the actual movie! The DVD has a altered version that removed the fact that Madison only changes back to a mermaid if she comes in contact with 'SALT' water! It doesn't destroy the film, but it does leave a sour taste in the mouth's of the people who saw the original theatrical version. The film is a very good romantic comedy/fantasy film, I would have given it a better rating if the DVD would have given both version of the film! BOOOOOOOOOOO :-("
4,"SWEET, FUNNY, ROMANTIC, ORIGINAL, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU ASK FOR?","Usually when I hear ""an 80's comedy"" I really hear ""a silly, gross, stupid comedy""...but not this time my friends, because ""Splash"" is one of the funniest films of the 1980s. You see, it really has it all: funny jokes, tender moments, romance, an intelligent script, and a very charismatic cast.In ""Splash"" we can see a very young Tom Hanks (in his comedic period), a promising Darryl Hannah (she didn't quite reach stardom, but in this movie she is great), a hilarious John Candy (in one of his finest and funniest performances), and Eugene Levy, he plays a wacky and clueless scientist.""Splash"" is a movie that effectively combines comedy with romance and fantasy, perhaps the movie succeeded so well because the people involved in the film were youthful and energetic, and they put their hearts in the making of ""Splash"". This movie is highly recommendable."
4,Splash: A movie worth watching.,Splash was a good movie in the 80s and it's a good movie now. It's a fun movie to watch with family or by yourself. I must've seen it at least 10 times on cable and as many times on DVD and it never gets boring. This is Tom Hanks first big movie and I believe it was there all Hannah's first big movie as well. As I said it's a fun movie to watch not just for Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah but also the supporting cast and the story as well. Not to mention this is a great movie from Ron Howard and his company. Overall I would give splash in 8.5 out of 10. It's something you'll remember and make sure you stay till the end there's about 4 or 5 seconds that are worth watching. I won't ruin the surprise but it's worth watching till the start of the credits. So enjoy splash and have a great day. Allen W Yoakum
3,Ok,"I don't remember when this came out but I was little and loved it then. I watched it back along with a few other Tom Hanks movies and I still enjoyed watching it, but not as much as when I was a little one. Tom Hanks used to be cute!"
3,Deja Vu All Over Again,"In a nutshell, this remake of ""I Wake Up Screaming"" doesn't work whether you saw the original or this is your first time exposed to the story. The film is saddled with a blah cast and uninspired direction. The film's lone redeeming point is Richard Boone's account of dogged police detective Ed Cornell. Alas, that even suffers when compared to the masterful turn by Laird Cregar in ""Screaming"". This is by no means a bad film just an ordinary one. If it popped up on TCM you probably wouldn't be inclined to change the channel."
2,Noir Wanna-Be,"A pedestrian vehicle that is undermined even further by mediocre writing, uninspired directing, and lackluster acting, with the one exception being Richard Boone, who would have been better off being lackluster. Instead, he shamefully overacts in a role that, to add insult to injury, is poorly written to begin with. There's nothing ""noir"" about this noir wanna-be. None of these actors come close to playing hard-boiled, which is what this film sorely needed. There's never any doubt where this film is heading, and while sometimes inevitability can be compelling, in this movie it's no fun at all getting there. The one saving grace is that it's a blessedly short film."
2,just ok,"The data transfer is very very slow. It wasn't mentioned at the time of purchase that the product has a USB 1.0 or a 2.0. I still don't beleive that this product is a USB 2.0 . I have thrown away the product packing and now has now way to track its specs., . If you want to purchase this product, check the specifications and then purchase."
4,Easy storage and transfer -- Get a handfull,Great for quick backup of daily critical data; got five and labeled one for each day of the week for easy and secure backup of daily accounting files.
3,Good Price for item. Bad Price for shipping,"I got this bundled with a memory card for my phone. Two very small items from eek tech. Both work fine, but I ended up paying about $15 for items and $15 dollars for shipping, which is a lot for 4 oz worth of items!"
5,Easy Transfers,"A GREAT little compact data transfer device. Holds half a Gig, which is pretty good for the price. Highly recommend for the ""on the go"" graphic artist, especially."
3,Kingston Data Traveler USB flash drive - 512 MB,The products work fine except for one which came dead on arrival.
2,"Worked great for 2 years, then....","Worked great for exactly 2 years, then I tried to stop at a light that just turned red, and... no brakes. The ABS was humming, and preventing the brakes from engaging. Almost T-boned a mustang. Immediately brought it into the Ford Stealership and had to pay $900 for a new one to be installed because the built-in ABS sensor was bad. Would have put in a new one myself, but I was 200 miles away from home and didn't feel like driving home in a 8,000 pound guided missile. I intentionally got the Timken due to the reviews in the diesel forums. Guess I got a bad one. Bearing seemed to be fine, sensor went bad. Either way, was a pain in the butt, and the wallet."
5,Just see it.,"My favorite movie. A life of crime has never been this exciting, this fun, this gripping, or, eventually, this painful."
3,Over the Top,"I don't quite know what the make of Nixon. Was it satire, farce or did Stone intend it to be a serious biopic? It's totally over the top. Oliver Stone's Nixon is part anti-Christ and part obvious nutcase. Anthony Hopkins seemed to be channeling Jack Nicholson's performance in The Shinning.I seriously doubt that the real people depicted in this movie actually spoke in long monolouges. I also don't believe that some of the scenes depicted ever took place.This movie had so much potential but Stone blew it by going overboard. It's not exactly ""Mommy Dearest"" but it does verge on being campy."
2,another fantasy,"BEWARE this is not a biographical film. It is a fiction based on a real person. This movie actually portrays Nixon as being involved in the deaths of JFK and Robert Kennedy,It's shallow. Lacking understanding of this deep man, the writers decided to go for sleeze and innuendo. I am surprised they did not stoop to a car chase."
4,Enlightening but Chaotic,"The first hour of this film, after a brief introduction to set the basis of the storyline for the viewer, is a flashback that displays the depth of the subject of this film. The rapid fire nature of the topics that are dealt with forces the viewer to piece together events on the fly, which I am sure was the case during these troubling times.The approach that Mr. Stone takes to this story telling should be considered an artistic interpretation of what these times really were. The character development of Nixon shows a possible loss of contact with reality.In a subplot, this film also deals briefly with a familiar subject for Mr. Stone, the Vietnam War."
4,"Great, If You Like Horror Movies","If you didn't know better, you'd expect Frankenstein to pop up in the first scene, not Anthony Hopkins' caricature of Nixon. The accents are pretty bad: Hopkins is a Scotchman playing a southern Californian. If you don't know your history very well, you'll be fooled and flummoxed by all this nonsense. If you do know history, then it's safe to watch this as pure entertainment, which, as such, isn't half bad. Stone's purely speculative connections about Nixon's youth and his role in the Bay of Pigs are just that, so beware. I had to watch it over three days: it's pretty long. But it's worth the time, as most any Stone film is. Just don't take it too seriously."
3,AN OLIVER STONE MISFIRE,"OLIVER STONE has made some excellent movies to be sure, but like all directors he miss the marks once in a while.Such is the case here with NIXON ,an old project that stayed on his desk far too long.Never half as interesting as his film about KENNEDY, NIXON is long and often boring to watch.It is not the fault of ANTHONY HOPKINS who gives it a valiant try.One of the most annoying STONE trick is the use of montage to fill the screen with images often unnecessary.The WATERGATE thing has been the subject of an excellent documentary more interesting than this history lesson.Catch this film on a late night tv screening.If you are drunk, then you might think that ANTHONY HOPKINS is really RICHARD NIXON."
2,Hopkins Miscast,"That English actor as Dick Nixon? Get outta here! How about 60s comedian David Frye or someone without a trace of an English accent and a feel for Nixon's unique personality and style. Hopkins' performance, with all due respect to this fine actor, in this case just does not present a believable characterization of ""Tricky Dick"". While this passes with JQ Adams, Nixon is too recent and well known of an historical figure, one with a too pedestrian of an American plebian style to be credibly captured as someone cut from the cloth of a British patrician; indeed contemporary American politicians, to the extent that they don't embody this, conciously cultivate a ""low caste"" style as part of the political persona they market to the masses. This, of course, is part of the ""race to the bottom"" in America's increasingly polarized political scene."
2,**,"I heard Oliver Stone promoting this film on NPR. He said, ""I share certain traits of Nixon's."" When the interviewer asked Stone to name one of those traits, Stone said, ""Paranoia."" That admission kind of sums up everything that's wrong with this and all of Oliver Stone's films. Well, at least he admits to his paranoia. Too bad he has to splash it up on movie screens."
4,"Nixon, I still wounder?","As... a film, Nixon was a bit confusing. Obiously I did not live during the era,and it was a bit confusing for me to grasp the producers point of view. I did gain the sence of simpathy over the president. It gave the Real Nixon a personal and humane sence. ""An ordrinary guy who all he wanted was to be accepted no matter the price.""..."
4,Tricky Dick meets Tricky Oliver,I like this movie. Nixon did some good things like ending the draft the clean air and water act. This movie mostly shows Nixons bad side Anthony Hopkins does a good job one highlight is when Nixon goes to the lincolin memorial and talks to antiwar proteters. Some of Oliver Stones insinuations are not believable i doubt Nixon met with JFK conspiriitors. Nixon for all its faults has good cinematography and is likley the best Nixon movie well ever see.
2,2 star only for the dvd release,Can you believe? about 205 minutes of feature with DTS soundtrack and audio commentary on a single sided dual-layer disc? This movie should hav been splitted into 2 DVDs not 1 DVD with poor quality! at least they could sacrifice DTS soundtrack to improve the quality!
3,Nothing like having Nixon to kick around!,"The movie starts on a dark and windy night. As rain pours and lightning strikes, the camera approaches an empty, somber White House. Who do you guess despairs inside?If your answer is Nixon in a black nightgown playing the organ by the light of several rusted candelabra, you'd be wrong, but it would have made a better picture! In fact, it's nothing but a Boris Karloff B horror movie disguised as a serious statement by conceited director Oliver Stone, whose paranoid prejudices envision hidden demons in every person he dislikes.It's fun, though. An all-star cast caricatures all sorts of Washington ghouls you'd love to hate (my favorite is Bob hoskins playing J.Edgar Hoover as a raving fruit!). Although Joan Allen, Ed Hermann and Paul Sorvino do resemble the characters they impersonate, the rest rely more on a leap of faith on your part, and in Anthony Hopkins' case, a big somersault! He should have put on a nose prop!My advise: Rent it first."
2,Great acting in a very flawed film,"""Nixon"" is perfect example of how to take outstanding performances by actors and totally negate them through what can only be described as gross artistic, technical, and historical license. Anthony Hopkins (as Richard Nixon), Joan Allen (as Pat Nixon), and Paul Sorvino (as Henry Kissinger) give powerful performances, but director/screenwriter Oliver Stone completely spoils their efforts with his positively weird use of camera angles, oddly placed scenes, color, and his blatant attempt to re-write history.What remains is a completely disjointed, disorganized mess; a highly sensational and fictionalized study of a dark and brooding soul, told in such a way as to do a terrible injustice to performers, moviegoers, and history alike. On top of everything else, ""Nixon"" is far too long, moves too slowly, and is a complete bore.Even Dick Nixon, for all his flaws, deserves better than this!!"
2,Richard Nixon on acid,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, Anthony Hopkins did a fine job, but what do we need with a psychedelic re-telling of the life of Richard Nixon? The reality was bad enough."
1,you get what you pay for,"First the cord is very short and barely reaches from the outlet to my bedside table. After only a months worth of use it broke when I was trying to unplug the pin tip from the phone. The tip broke right off. I wish they had made these things more durable. Well, you get what you pay for."
5,Excellent!,The product has worked extremely well! I had purchased several for my disabled brother who keeps losing them. Now he has one for every room.
1,Not happy,I threw the chargers away after trying them out. I ordered 2 and not one worked for my Nokia 6201. I guess it was cheaper to just get rid of them instead of being hassled with back and forth emails with the manufacturer and the cost of returning the package.
3,It works!,"The drum (the pin) which connects to cell phone is not lengthier enough. It takes two three tries to start the charging, unlike my original charger which I lost."
4,good charger,"This a good charger, especially for the price. Works just as well as the original. Would have given it 5 stars, but the shipping was too expensive for such a little product."
5,"Good charger, excellent price",Don't by a new charger retail. Get this one. Including shipping it beats your local discount store.
4,"Excellent, an intro to the master of English ghost stories","Welcome to the world of M.R. James. A thoroughtly enjoyable and terrifying read. James' works read like a combination of Baigent, Eco, Lovecraft and Barker. He is THE father of the English ghost tale and from him springs the rest of the Western canon of horror literature. There's gore glore but be prepared to be engaged on an intellectual level like no other horror writer has ever done so before. Must read."
4,Wonderfully perplexing and entertaining mystery,"Carlene Miller's book is a breakthrough -- a wonderful mystery with well-developed characters I feel as if I now know. I particularly enjoyed reading first person account of Lexy Hyatt, former english teacher turned newspaper reporter, who went above and beyond the call of duty to help track down the murderer. Ms. Miller did an astounding job of revealing just enough detail to keep the reader guessing to the very end.Why a breakthrough? Not only did Carlene Miller write a great mystery, but she wrote from inside the circle of a gay (lesbian) community. I recommend the book to anyone who possesses an open mind and a passion for mysteries no matter what their sexual orientation may be. Be warned...it's pretty steamy! ;-)"
4,Good Enough,"Slik hasn't reinvented the wheel, just made a decent tripod head at a fair price.I was looking for a pan/tilt head with two handles and without a quick release plate (personal preferences). There aren't many to choose from, and this is the least expensive one I could find.The SH-706 does the job. Finish is adequate and build is solid. My current camera and lens combinations weigh under 3 lbs, but I can believe the claimed 11 lb capacity.For portability, each handle can be removed from the head. And one handle will screw into the bottom of the other.My only disappointment is that some motions can be a bit stiff and balky. Not terrible, but not buttery smooth. It can be difficult to achieve a small, precise movement. There are screws for adjusting tension, but they're not a cure.All in all, it's a good deal and I'd buy it again. However, if fluid performance is important, you should probably look elsewhere."
4,Good Variety,"This volumn contains a good all-around variety of patterns and schemes. Most designs are three to a page (8.5 x 11). They require enlarging. The range of difficulty varies, most look intricate in the small size on the page but when enlarged to window size the number of peices per square foot is reasonable.The patterns are (or can be) grouped into coordinated window sets, for example: a doorway with matching sidelights and a fanlight. Most of the patterns include flowers, but not all. Some the the themes include hummingbirds (very nice) blended with flowers, a dove, herons, sea gulls, callas, irises, daffodills, roses, tulips, morning glories, grapes with vines, dogwood (geomatical), parrots, landscapes (sailboat, sunsets with a bird and water), and geometrics (good for bevels).I have used some of the flower details extracted from the overall patterns."
4,A classic tale of Good vs Evil and those caught in between.,"This tale is about a group of futuristic, and at times barbaric, heros whose story started several years before. Only this time the battle takes place far away from Earth in an attempt to save it. Caught between internal politics with a touch of traitors and the enemy, a hive-like race of genetically engineered beings with a lust for power, in their mission of liberation against this race. Will they prevail? Find out in this book and the next one, Rubicon!"
4,"Beautiful illustrations, but text is abridged","I was disappointed to find that this edition is abridged by Inga Moore. My children loved it, and the illustrations are whimsically delightful, but I was expecting and hoping for Kenneth Grahame's original, classic style. For the very young reader, the abridging might be appropriate. My littlest (3.5yo) finds it easier to sit through this shortened version. I noticed that the reference to the badger, which the townspeople were holding captive in anticipation of having ""a little fun,"" was among what was cut -- so again, for a young reader this might be a more appropriate edition. This, combined with the lovely illustrations, was what caused me to give it 4 stars. However, some of the most humorous and witty turns of phrase of the original are missing here, leaving me somewhat disappointed with the end result."
5,Especially charming... especially rich...,"Kenneth Grahame's other wonderful story, retold.But, this time around, what is especially charming, especially rich,what makes all the difference is something new: the captivating illustrations.John Segal's images are much more than simply illustrative additions;they are a stream of the most beautiful, diminutive, vibrant watercolour paintings.They make the book.Mr. Segal's art lends color and life to the story -- and his handwrittenexcerpts add a dimensionality and energy to the text -- in a way that youcannot glean until you have the deliriously gorgeous volume happily in hand.Perfect.BTW The story incorporates that ever important, inestimably valuablemoral lesson: things may not be what they first appear to be...or... what we first (and sometimes erroneously) conclude them to be...to our happy surprise."
3,What is this? Almighty Karoke?,"I expected to find remixes by the original artists on this CD, but it turns out to be some original artists (like Hannah Jones and Deja Vu) but most are by some no-name artists filling in for the vocals. Madonna's songs are by ""Who's that Girl"" for instance.It still good Almighty mixing so I don't mind listening to it, but its not worth the price tag."
4,very entertaining,All waterfowl hunters can relate to the funny photos in this coffee table book. I'm looking foward to see what they come up with next.
4,nice lights,these lights fit perfectly and look great. the design requires you to move the front bumper out of the way to install. the stock ones are the same so in order to remove the old ones you have to do the same.
3,good for beginners,"The video does give someone with not much ballet experience a good demostration of steps, but it did not feel much like a class because the instructure counted all the beats, and I would have preferred real music. Also I would have liked more emphasise on longer combinations, and less emphasise on how to do the steps. If you have had a lot of ballet experience, this is not the video for you, but if you are still a beginner you should appreciate this video."
3,No music during the bar exercises!?,This isn't a bad tape if you are just getting started again (if you have some experience). But you can tell the tape has been edited by someone who hasn't had instruction (ie having to rewind to do both sides in some cases) and the accompaniment is the instructor counting!
5,Beginners CELEBRATE!!,"I just couldn't find it in my nerves to take a ""formal"" ballet class. I rented this video series at the library, and used it so much I decided to buy it - mainly because when I went back, it was always checked out. I knew nothing about ballet, but now I feel comfortable enough to step into a beginning class, dressed properly and ready for some more personalized instruction. Truly, I don't mind the instructor counting because the music is something I never missed. I love the dances at the end, and recommend it for beginners."
2,Okay for beginners but not great,"I recently started taking ballet classes in my early twenties. I ordered ""Ballet 101: A Beginners Class"" as well as ""Ballet 201"" The first video was a great as far as walking you through the moves, but the second video uses new moves and for some of them it doesn't even explain how to do these moves. Also there is no music, most ballet classes have music and it is the music you use to count out your moves. Also, the instructor starts to tell you what you are doing so you are watching to get the counts and preparing to do the exercise but instead of doing the exercise she switches sides, so you have to stop rewind and try again. The editing is horrible and may be part of the problem. All in all I recommend the David Howard ballet series, it is more like an actual class and it is easier to dance along with."
5,A powerfully written and thoughtfully presented selection,"Naked Buddhism: 39 Ways To Free Your Heart And Awaken To Now by David Deida is a powerfully written and thoughtfully presented selection of brief passages on the fleeting nature of life, sexuality, passion, and the ""moment of now"", and the importance of opening one's heart and one's love. From sexuality as an art to coming to terms with impending death, Naked Buddhism is a profound and memorable treatise, and a highly recommended contribution to the growing library of Buddhist literature for contemporary American readers."
5,This book will take you deeper,"I love this book. In poetically beautiful language the author describes subtle but powerful practices that open my heart beyond my habitual limited sense of self. For me this book transends the normal fare of banal new age spirituality. It offers lucid practical spiritual guidence while making absolutely obvious to me, depths of consciousness I could previously only intuit. Naked Buddhism offers an extensive array of straight forward easy to grasp practices for deepening spiritual awarness."

3,Educational,"I used this movie in my high school physics class. It has aspects of the Manhattan Project that I was able to flesh out with my students (i.e. physics behind nuclear weapon technology, why development of the first nuclear bomb was a high priority at the end of WWII, etc.) While not 100% accurate; it was good enough and entertaining enough to be useful in my class."
4,"I Am Become Death, Destroyer of Worlds","Useful introduction for teachers to the Manhattan Project, the relationship between Groves and Oppenheimer, and the moral calamities faced by that first generation of atomic scientists. The film sometimes plays fast and loose with the sequence of events (Hollywood calls this ""compression""), as in the case of a young scientist who dies of radiation sickness, but it's not as egregious as Gibson's ""The Patriot"". A good place to start with students born after 1995."
4,Hollywood History,"If you're looking for a documentary full of facts, this movie is not your choice.Fat Man and Little Boy uses history as the foundation of its story, which is really to illustrate the great moral dilemma the scientists and military personnel involved in the Manhattan Project were faced with as they realized the potential (both positive and negative) of ""The Gadget"" they were building. The story is not so much on ""how"" the bomb was built, but on the repercussions of the bomb. In this, it does quite well, trying its best to be balanced. In the end, however, the producers miss the balancing act and come across fairly strongly ""anti-nuke"". They do present both sides throughout, despite the stand they take at the end.A well-acted movie, Newman and Schultz do a good job and the film is entertaining. History as a backdrop for a moral argument, rather than history for history's sake."
1,Very Disappointing,"As much as I admire Paul Newman, this film is so terribly flawed that even his presence can't salvage it. The Manhattan Project is such a critical juncture in recent history that I think it's very important that the story be told realistically. This film is 90% Hollywood formula and 10% history. Only in the broadest brushstrokes does this movie give the viewer any kind of concept of that monumental undertaking. Do yourself a BIG favor; watch the far superior (and very accurate) ""Day One"" instead. In all respects, it is a much better account and much more interesting film. The main characters are presented as scientists, engineers, and military officers, not goofballs and nutty professors, as they are in ""Fat Man and Little Boy."""
1,Meledramatic and poor,"As much as I like Paul Newman, this movie is very disappointing once you've seen the far-superior film ""Day One"". The portrayal of Oppenheimer and Groves is overly dramatic and totally unlike the behavior of real professional people. The movie dwells on romantic side stories instead of fleshing out the history and science of the Manhatten project.Be sure to see ""Day One"" if you are interested in this, and give this film a miss."
4,Pretty Good,"A very good, pretty historically accurate movie. Some events take place out of order, and there's a slight technical problem near the end where a shock wave exceeds the speed of sound by 3000%."
1,"Worse than flawed. Vapid, dumb, awful.","Anyone who has seen the British TV production of ""Oppenheimer"" (1978) is bound to see this dopey film as bad. Really BAD! Sam Waterston played Oppenheimer like he owned the part in the British version. The guy who plays Oppie in this version doesn't look right and he doesn't act right. Not at all convincing. And Paul Newman should have stood in bed instead of taking the part of Groves. I'd be embarrassed if I'd been an actor who'd gotten caught appearing in this stinker."
3,"Strange, but good movie.","I saw this movie on tv a year ago. It's hard to say what this movie's about. Mainly a (mentally handicapped?) overweight boy who plays piano, has an over proctective mother with diabetes, and some strange dream-like things happen."
2,dissapointed,"I am a big fan of the Justice league & JL unlimited animated series. I assumed that i would like this as well. Nope. The story is slow paced, the animation would be good if this was the 90's. Green lantern doesn't come around until the last 5 mins, Batman looks too Adam West-y, The villain (the most important aspect of a show like this) is crap. Ok people who gave it more than 2 stars can you honestly say that you don't agree with my points. Please leave responses to this."
3,Entertaining yet un-fulling,"After watching the Justice League TV show and Justice League Unlimited TV show, I was a little disappointed after watching this movie. Perhaps I was expecting a continuation of the TV show, and that's not what this is. The voices were good, but the animation was not as good as it was in the TV show and seems to have been written completely differently. In the end, however, the movie was entertaining and I really did enjoy watching it."
4,Dug It Fo' Sho',"I'm sure there are purists who'll dis this, but I thought they got it right on this one. Where ""Superman: Doomsday"" was predictable and uninspired, this is intriguing and unique, and it oozes style. The character designs are rather basic, but they work here; Green Lantern feels like the center of the story, but all our favorites get their due. I recommend this movie whole heartedly, for adults and youth alike."
4,Justice League is super!,"As a life long Justice League fan of 35 years, it was wonderful to see my life long heroes come to life on tv! Great to see Hal Jordan ""the real"" Green Lantern take center stage. Look forward to many, many more JLA adventures!!"
3,new frontier,hi i have bought meny dvd and i have all the jla in dvd the old the newand in archives of jla the new frontier was a happy surprise for me i hope that they continue the sequel and this will be a pilot movie. for me is that i want for a long time it is that i want to see
2,Justice League,"Well, I bought this for my grandson because he is really into the avengers, power rangers and so much more. I wasn't prepared for cussing in the movie. I found it not to be for my 3 year old grandson."
2,Answers breed more questions,"A bit anti-climactic, given the advertising, but it is kind of cool to see these heroes in their circa 1950's uniforms. It's nice to see the Hal Jordan Lantern, too. But overall I was disappointed in the length of the film, most specifically it's brevity. And padding the disk with extra JLU episodes doesn't help, since the story itself is a total departure from the version depicted in the earlier JLA storylines regarding the formation of the league and the advent of the Watchtower. Not to mention that any self-respecting comic fan who would shell out their dough for this disk has the previous disks already, as a matter of course. Good for a rental only, unfortunately -for me, twenty-three bucks or so poorer- IMO. But Wonder Woman in combat boots almost makes up for it. Almost."
2,mcoka1,"I don't recommend this as a purchase. I was dissapointed with this being the first High Def Justice League release. I much prefer the Cartoon network versions. The story itself was mediocre as was the villan.However, I will say the HD video is excellent."
1,People actually liked this movie?,"In my honest opinion, this was a terrible movie. I agree with that other post that said that the Marvel releases were bad (although I did like the Dr. Strange one), but this wasn't any better. If anyone has seen the animated Justice League/ Justice League Unlimited cartoon on Cartoon Network, they are sure to be disappointed with this release. If they had at least used the same voice actors and artists from the cartoon series, this might have turned out better."
1,More mindless blood and graphic language from DC,"Just like the previous animated movie Superman|Doomsday, there is mindless gore and graphic violence and a WEAK story.The main heroes(shown on the cover) are useless. The main hero(Green Lantern) does not show up until the tail end of the movie.The alien entity is a floating rock. Wow, excitement there.The PG13 is just another excuse for immature writers to justify using excessive blood and graphic language.WonderWoman lets people kill each other than has the audacity to criticize American government. LAME.The cynical self loathing attitude of this movie wears on you.The build up takes way too long.Not worth the hype, just boring lousy drawn anime with uneccesary blood and graphic words.I strongly recommend the Justice League episodes for that classic comic book feel and fun.Avoid this clunker"
4,New Frontier marks a new era for the animated films,"If only all the animated releases from DC were like this! This was not intended for kids. It's for an adult audience and I was surprised it wasn't mentioned on the packaging. For all intents and purposes this was a great introduction to the current Justice League. It's from a 60's era and all the great pop culture themes are represented from that time. I'd like to see a sequel to this profoundly good film of the super hero genre.If you are looking for Super-Friends, your not going to find it here. This film was a great adaptation of the graphic novel, New Frontier. The characters are all drawn in a Kirby-esque style. It's as if Jack Kirby drew for DC all those years,instead of Marvel. If there are any sequels,don't stop with the Kirby style. It's a very effective portrayal for this era of comics."
4,Watch it before you show it to the kids,"Loved the whole retro feel, but please watch this before you show it to the kids. It is PG13, and besides some mild language there is a very disturbing scene in the first 5 minutes I wasn't prepared for. It was tastefully done, but I really wished I had known. I thought the Green Lantern story line was great, but the last part felt like Origins from Justice Leage and wasn't really necessary. It was kind of rushed at the end, but it left me wanting more."
2,Cliff-Notes Justice League,"It's a bare-bones plot outline; not really a plot. It's almost like you're getting the highlights, because the scenes seem unrelated to each other. People come in, make cameos, and then disappear. No one really gets any screen time, including Bruce Timm's paramour Batman. Even Superman and Wonder Woman are barely in it and the Justice League is in it for literally a couple of minutes. Each hero is abruptly introduced (no back story) and then disappears.The fight scenes are stiff-looking, as is the animation. While the character design is OK, and the graphic quality is alright, it doesn't look any better than a TV episode. I expected something more, especially since it has to prop up such a thin ""lurking evil that we never see and is easily defeated"" plot. There's actually more plot in the ending montage than anywhere else."
4,Worthy Animation of New Classic,"An excellent adaptation of the Darwyn Cooke series, marred only by a rushed running time and excised subplots. It needed more room to breathe and more time to explore the various characters. That said, the source material is is fairly minimalist and the film does an adequate job telling that same story, even if abridged. Narrative flaws aside, the animation and design are gorgeous, and I caught myself several times grinning like a little kid as I watched it all unfold. It's worth your time."
4,"Very well done, love seeing these characters treated so well","Like others mention in their reviews for this item, these are the characters and heroes that I remember from my youth. While I appreciate the work that goes into the new versions of Justice League or the Batman animated series, the characters in New Frontier are closer to the classics I read and so thoroughly enjoyed in the past.The story here is a bit weak and convoluted in the villian that must be fought, but the animation is top notch, the characters come with the history that I remember and seeing them come together to work as a team is quite fun.I hope this is just the start of more stories set in the same era and virtual world.5 stars for the nostalgia, 3 stars for the story, leaving a 4 star product for those that want to purchase it."
5,Pure clean-cut DC,Clean concise to the point and very entertaining. This is one of the best animated comic book genre films i've seen in a while. The plot moves along very well without omitting anything important. The surprising thing was that they were able to introduce so many characters so well without making it heavy. Those who are fans of these comics will not be disappointed because they will not have to put up with pointless aspects of back-story that take away from the plot. while those who are new to DC will be captured by compelling characters that they will want to learn more about. I strongly recommend it.
2,Here's the problem with The New Frontier......,The running time wasn't long enough The New Frontier's storyline was too extensive so the story couldn't be told effectively in a seventy-five minute time span...a two hour and thirty minute time span maybe but obviously seventy-five minutes wasn't long enough.
1,Not worth it,I was very Disappointed it the movie. It took you in too many directions and there was really very little story line. The bad guy you know nothing about. He (It) just appears and that all you know and then the movie is just about over. Save your money and buy something else.
3,Writers are ignorant of history or just don't care.,"The story is great, the animation is fantastic, but,the writer and I assume also producers, seem to think that North Korea and South Korea are completely equivalent societies.I had to pause the DVD and explain real history to the kids watching, and that sometimes people in ""Hollywood"" are just ignorant and you have to look past that ignorance and enjoy the art and talent."
4,Pretty Solid,This was a solid film... Trying to bridge the gap between the golden age of comics to the new age
3,It was entertaining,"I had forgotten I had this blu ray, if that is saying anything. It was entertaining, worth the watch if you find a good deal on it. I like the ""darker"" comics a little more than this adaptation. I wish it was grittier."
1,Very Disappointed,"I'll give you this. The animation was nice. There was a nice cast. That was it. The plot was incredibly disappointing. I spent more time trying to figure out what each scene had to do with the overall plot than actually enjoying the flow of the movie. Every character had to be introduced with back story included and every character had to have his or her own showplace. Don't we already KNOW their backstories? Don't we already know what powers they have and what they can do? Do we need tacked on characters? Green Arrow, Robin, and Aquaman were just there for us to see how well animated they were and that was about it. After all the anticipation I felt when I found out this was coming, I feel severely let down."
1,in poor taste,"As a child of the 1970's, I watched innumerable episodes of the Justice League. I was hoping to share this experience with my own children - I had hoped that they would love it and the superheros as did I when I was young. I found that only 2 minutes or less into the film - this animated cartoon - supposedly geared toward children, was really only a form of Grand Theft Auto or Mortal Combat set in superhero facade. It became graphically violent in mere seconds. Not for children by any stretch of the imagination. It does not even represent the true nature of the original episodes. I do not appreciate when cartoonists make movies based on loved characters that are twisted into a version of the new ultra-violent society we live in. If you are a parent - read this - do not let your children see this movie! Anyone who wonders why society has gotten so out-of-control anti-desentizied to violence need only to watch this ""cartoon"" to see where our society is headed."
1,Dead Frontier,"A complete waste of money. Some of the worst animation I have seen in many a year. The voice acting was very poor. The name actors and actresses came across wooden and stiff. After the brilliant animated DC JLA series this was a true come down. The New Frontier comic book had its problems, Twenty-First century attitudes grafted on to the 1950s, but it was much better done than this. The villian was true to the type of end of world threats that the JLA did fight in its first incarnation, which is about the most that I can say for this mess, except for the hilarious Martian Manhunter watching TV scenes. Only for die-hard JLA collectors. Language and violence make this definitely unsuitable for kids. It is also too boring for the average kid. The JLA deserves a much better animated treatment than this drek."
4,Good,"This was a nice Spin on the J.L...I think ultimately The company was trying to appeal to the older generation of fans...as well as show the newer generation of fans how they got down down back in the day...and the story was fitting to the artist and concept...however, ultimately..theres a reason why DC and Marvel are doing better today than they were before..meaning...nice attempt but lets keep in in the present or future...Ultimiately...The product was accurate and delivery date was as well....i give this user and its dependability 4.8/5I would purchase from this user again as well as recommend them to others, due to FAIRNESS in PRICING and INTEGRITY"
3,Green lanter condones 2 million dead???,"The political correctness on this is really annoying. Just since the 1990's 2 million people have died from starvation in N. Korea. If Hal Jordan had his way, another 2 million may have died had N. Korea won the war. And that does not include the millions since the 50's and the political prisoners.This bit of political ignorance really annoyed me. This Hal Jordan was a coward.I did like the 50's style animation though. I agree with other reviewers about the storyline. It was convoluted from a lot of perspectives."
2,"Okay, but not for kids and not as good as the series","This is a decent stand-alone movie, but be warned--this is not for kids. Take the PG-13 seriously. The movie opens with a man's suicide (by handgun). The final act is not shown, but it's clear what he is going to do with the gun. Several scenes are bloody. Sure it's cartoon blood, but it can be disturbing even for kids as old as ten. A few ""son of a _____""s and some other choice language top it off.Otherwise, it has some nice moments, particularly some of the origin scenes for Silver Age Justice Leaguers. But overall, it lacks the charm of the TV series (and the series pilot had cooler aliens). Better than the Superman:Doomsday movie, but still not that great."
2,JL New Frontier - Nothing New,"I liked the JL series characters much better than the ones used in the New Frontier.Here is a comment to all animated series directors/producers: Could you please be consistent. In one episode, Superman is all powerful and almost nothing can hurt him, in another he is beaten easily; same for all the other characters. Also, the Superman series, the JL series, the Superman movies, the new animated Batman series, the old Super Friends series, and now the JL New Frontier movie, all have somewhat a different background story to tell about each of the characters, how they came to be, how the league started, who started and leads the league, etc. Finally, as for any Sci-Fi film, have you noticed that the good guys never add to their arsenals what they have learned from other encounters!"
3,Parent of young kids beware,"This video is rated PG-13, and with good reason. Parents with younger children who love supehero fare should view this film before handing it to their kids. The type of violence contained here certainly is not of your ""Super Friends"" variety; I suggest that even those with interested teenagers think long and hard. In the first five minutes alone, a suicide is implied with a gun being pointed at camera, multiple rapes of a group of women is implied by Wonder Woman (who just admitted to looking the other way as the group exacted revenge on their attackers), and downed airman Hal Jordan (future Green Lantern) is spattered with the blood of an enemy he shoots at point-blank range. This is not to imply the DVD is without merit--it is well-animated and the story is top-notch--only that parents should not mistake it for tamer animated adventures. This is hard-core adventure for older teens and adults."
3,Good movie but too much of a political message,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's a great homage to the golden age of comics. The artwork was right on target. The dialogue and voices are also in line with that era.The story starts out great, but the finishing sequences were disappointing. Somewhat anticlimactic.There are political messages within the movie which spoiled that ""golden age"" feel for me. Yes, those old comics had anti-communist leanings, but this movie's message was clearly the antithesis of that era, or should I say ""rejection"" of that era. I think Bruce Timm should have avoided the anti-anti communist message.This movie is worth buying and watching for those who like the Bruce Timm's work.Thanks."
2,over-hyped but ok,"I watched this particular endeavor...I'm a fan of the Justice League/JLU and other Batman, The Animated Series continuity series (Batman Beyond, Batman TAS, JL, JLU).While this was much better than the last direct to video Superman, where they didn't even cast Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor, it was not as good as JLU.For starters, I love Lucy Lawless...but her Wonder Woman just wasn't as good as the JLU series. Beyond the voice differences, the animation just wasn't as clean.Don't get me wrong, it was a decent hat-tip to the Golden/Silver Age artwork, but comic-book artwork has so seldom worked on in animation...which is why I liked the stylized Batman TAS, JLU type animation and artwork. It was smooth and worked quite well.I think Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman was a better direct to video."
3,The first 15 min,This DVD is absolutley not for children. Not for children that will question why hereos are allowing death. Why did that man hold the gun and the screen go dark. This is not a dvd for the kiddies. This is a dark look at heroes. At least in the first 15 mins. In shadows and light over 15 people died. I really like it so far but no way am I letting my infant see this. However for myself I will like this dvd. The story is interesting and the animation reminds me of the old Comic covers from the 50's. Some reason I keep thinking about the introduction to The Incredibles movie when I watch it.
3,Old School Justice League,"If you were born in the 70's and you are a comic fan then this is a must see for you! Unfortunately this Justice League is not the same with the JLU. This is for old school fans. I cant get used to Batmans costume, he looks like the one in the Scooby doo show! I gave it 3 * because of the nice visuals and some good extras."
2,"Not Very Good, Approaches Downright Bad","Watch a few episodes of Justice League and Justice League Unlimited instead. Time much better spent.Definitely NOT for kids, and not for adults who enjoy some of the other DCAU shows by Bruce Timm.I was very disappointed in this film. Voices don't fit the characters, underlying political statements, and a dull story don't add up to exciting superhero action. Letting them say mild cuss words doesn't make it more exciting or ""adult"" either. Yeah, slinging the SOB word REALLY advances the story there. I guess they thought the profanity would make it either ""edgy"" or maybe cover up the lackluster writing of the story.The only reason I gave it a 2 because the action scenes with the Flash were at least decent. He's the only character that they let DO anything besides stand around spouting somber jargon.Superman:Doomsday was not good, this was far worse."
5,Justice League - The New Frontier,"I didn't think I'd like this movie but I enjoyed it a lot. I was totally surprised by the people they had as voice actors and actresses for Batman and Wonder Woman, Lois Lane and Superman.PS, if you like Justice League and Justice League Unlimited then you will enjoy this movie. The only problem I had with this movie is that it wasn't long enough. I give Justice League - The New Frontier a 5 out of 5."
4,Very happy with this purchase.,I enjoyed this movie and seems very similar to the source material. I enjoy new takes on orgin stories of well loved comic characters.
1,Sometimes Old is Better than New,"I was looking forward to this new installment in the animated Justice League series. Having not read the D. Cooke graphic novel, I was not sure what to expect. I was disappointed by the slow pacing, the unremarkable villain, and the lack of chemistry among the characters. The voice talent here, seemingly upgraded from the regular actors from the regular series, is so lackluster. I like many of the actors, but found their voice acting to be so uninspired.Having watched this, I wondered what made Bruce Timm's original JL and JLU series so good. I think the answer is its concise format: each episode (or double ep) tells a story and gets out. ""New Frontier"" does in this movie format what perhaps Timm would do in the first and last five minutes of his episode(s). The rest is just wasted time. I don't recommend any JL or JLU fans to watch this -- and yes, I agree, this (unlike JL and JLU) really is not for young children. Sorry Hal Jordan, but ""Outstanding!""? Not."
1,Nothing but Blah,"The DVD is a scattering of interesting stories that are never actually touched upon, interspersed by disconnected scenes of the heroes trying to track down a thing called 'the center.' No hero does any actual work finding it, it is never insinuated that the heroes ever work together and so is a big surprise when they do (poorly) at the end, and characterization is flat and hollow and the same for everyone. The end battle is less exciting than any episode of a cartoon about card games and half of what happens in the movie is random and unexplained. This is the least entertaining of Timm's works I have ever seen and I have seen everything he's done with the DC universe that is available."
1,Save your $20!,"The movie has a vintage look to them which was refreshing. I was expecting a hero-filled, action-packed movie, instead what we get is about five minutes of action towards the end of the movie! Additionally, those very little action scenes were gory and brutal.This movie might have been called ""Green Lantern- the origin"". About a quarter featured Hal Jordan and the rest was a spotlight on the Martian Manhunter. The cover was misleading with all the heroes in fighting poses. What we get is a handful of justice leaguers finshing off the movie.I am very disapointed, I hope Bruce Timm reads this review!"
3,Not a Kids Movie,"I have not seen the entire film yet, but the first 15 minutes or so of the movie contain some rather adult content. While it is nothing that would shock a mature audience, I would strongly advise a parent watching the movie first to make sure it is appropriate for his or her child. The film has a PG-13 rating which I would take seriously. Fans of the Justice League or Justice League Unlimited series should be aware that this is a very different genre of film. The packaging and its placement alongside the more child-friendly animation offerings doesn't give an accurate assessmentof the target audience for the film.That being said, so far it is an intriguing film and I look forward to seeing the rest."
2,Meh.,"This movie is meh. The action scens are a bit too few and far between, the plot of it doesn't go well with the super hero main characters, Martian Manhunter looks weird and the animation is okay. This film has some appeal, but isn't really worth checking out in my opinion. 5/10"
3,almost a dream come true,"I have always wished for a old school Dc Movie but I'll have to keep wishing.I'm glad I didn't buy this. I am old school all the way. I love the golden age Dc heroes and was pumped at the idea of a Golden Age-Silver age style. I thought one of the reasons that so many of us loved the old school was that there was so little hard core violence and language.I am bewildered why ""first PG-13""! In this movie and ""Death of superman"" is such a selling point. So I look at it in the store and think wow! finally I get to see Wonder Woman all bloody!A Justice league with swearing and violence! I gotta have it! I loved the art work and the Cold War idea but from the creepy demonic Suicied at the begining to the slow motion bullet through the head, I knew this wouldn't do it.Why do we need this to have a good story? I'm so tired of everything being done for tweens and anime lovers. It is a fact that family moviesdo way better then any other movies."
1,Bob Larson: 2000 McCarthy,"I read the book in Spanish, and to be honest, this is one of the worst books ever seen. Apart of the lies about groups like Led Zeppelin and the Moody Blues, probably he doesn't know anything about the Satanic songs of their Christian groups like Petra. Apart, he's not a man of God: he's a man of GOLD!. So, I have to advice you: Beware America: Bob Larson is haunting some witches..."
1,Absurd!,"This is quite possibly the most absurd tripe I have ever read. Larson would have us believe that virtually every rock band in existence is a cohort of Satan. I find it difficult to accept that even he believes a word of it. You might want to read for a laugh, but it's not good for much else.--Greg Klebanoff"
3,Larson on the right track but falls short of nailing it down,"This book is a reprint of a book Larson originally published in 1980, entitled simply ""Rock."" In my opinion, the 1980 version was far more informative since it got right to the heart of what's wrong with Rock ""music""--namely, the anapestic, sensual rhythm of the music itself as opposed to just the lyrics. In this 1987 version Larson has dramatically toned down his criticism of rock and concentrates almost solely on the lyrics and the lifestyles of the performers instead of analyzing the sinful nature of the beats behind it. Nonetheless, it is still a useful reference for any serious Christian or pastor who might be confronting the ill effects of rock among today's Church and society. He provides an interesting alphabetical index of some of the top rock performers and the problems in their music, but it's a bit outdated since it was written in the late 1980s."
4,HCM645 humidifier does the job,"I bought one from Meijer and went back for another in late winter and they did not have anymore. I found the 2nd one on Amazon at clearance price of 41.00I like the features of the 645 with various humidity and speed settings. It is very quite on low setting and the upper setting are like white noise, not a nuisance.I believe the 645 is replaced by 650."
1,this humidifier is defective!!! BEWARE,"Having read some of the other reviews here I recognize exactly the problem we had - the thing ran for maybe ten days and then the motor quit, forever. Unlike other and wiser reviewers, we had already discarded the packaging materials so there's no returning it. Money down the drain. A worthless piece of junk..."
4,Not Quite!,My new one did NOT come with a ProTec continuous cleaning cartridge and it sure does NOT have an auto-shut-off feature!
1,BEWARE--Product description is WRONG,"Product description for this model states that it has auto shut-off when the tank is empty. This is WRONG! I was so angry at getting YET ANOTHER humidifier that did not shut off, I called the company. Turns out they have DELIBERATELY REMOVED the auto shut-off feature. Yet, they do not describe this in their literature, and the description given to retailers (amazon.com is certainly not responsible for the text) is clearly wrong -- and has been so for YEARS.So be aware that you can't leave this humidifier alone for long without getting dry, dirty air out of it. Depending on your reason for needing a humidifier, this could be a real problem.What a lousy, incompetent company! The warranty is worthless as well, judging by the comments of others below."
3,Simple Humidifier. But doesnt work well allways.,"After 3-4 weeks of use it stopped working. Initially I thought it was the auto-switch off mechanism at work. But I noticed that even when it was really dry, it wouldnt switch on. Luckily I had bought a replacement plan also. So I replaced it with the same model. It has been working well for the last 2-3 months.It is easy to clean. But the filter that came with the humidifier tore while cleaning, because it was made of paper. I think the new filters available for this model are made of plastic, so it should last a little longer."
3,Humidifier ...,"I bought this item because of the capacity of the water that it holds. We use a wood stove and need to get moisture into the house. I thought that 4 gallons would last at least 12 hours, but it does not. The humidifier is a bit noisy, but it seems to work well. I just wish that the water would last a bit longer."
1,Hcm 645,"I have two other portable humidifiers from diffrent manufacturers.Do not waste your money. Altough the design is nice, this machine is to loud even on lowest setting."
3,Good but noisy and hard to maintain.,"The main function of the humidifier (which is to HUMIDIFY) is great; it works really good. I have a big room and before it I bought 3 other models (including the expensive Air-O-Swiss AOS Ultrasonic Humidifier - 7135). Just this model is able to humidify the room. However, silence is not one of the strengths of this machine. Also, maintenance is another problem. you have to clean it every week and CHANGE the filter regularly. So, when buying this humidifier, keep in mind the cost of replacing the filters, and the time you will have to spend to keep it working properly."
3,"Allergy sufferers, BEWARE!","I received this humidifier as a Christmas Present this year because I suffer from a severe mold allergy and was told that sleeping with a cool mist humidifier would cut down on my allergy/asthma attacks at night. WRONG! After 2 months of continuous use, I came down with a terrible broncial infection. I thought it couldn't possibly be the humidifier, so I didn't think twice about it, until I went to move it once when filling it and the front cover came off where the filter sits. It was COVERED in MOLD! The description of this humidifier says that the filter eliminates mold in the air, but it doesn't say that it traps it in the filter and blows it back into the air!"
1,"Loud, Leaky, and Moldy","It's loud, like being in a cheap hotel, we can't sleep with it on at night. Leaky, the tank is always leaking, when we fill it up. Moldy, the filter gets mold 1-2 weeks after we put a new one in. It is now in the trash. Save your money buy something else."
2,Not as anticipated,"I recently purchased a Honeywell ""Quietcare"" Humidifier HCM645. But it is not quiet at all. It occasionally has a rattling noise, and the fan is quite loud. I have portable fans that are quieter than the fan in this Humidifier. I probably should have returned it, but I suspect another one would be just as noisey. Plus, since it's washed, set up and full of water, to return it and prepare a new one would be a lot of work. Now I have also discovered that it needs the filter changed once a month, at a cost of $12.99 each plus shipping. Also they recommend a cleaning cartridge, which is not included and is another expense. I would never buy this again."
2,Inexcusably noisy,"I read the other reviews that complained about the noise of this ""Quiet Cool"" humidifier. I thought, heck, I like white-noise sounds, I won't mind this. Or maybe the reviewers are being unreasonable.No. Really. This unit is absurdly loud. And I've had several other Honeywell-aka-Kaz units in the past.Otherwise, the operation is fine - easy to fill and use. Straightforward controls. I never have the problems others seem to have with mold on the filter, likely because I run it until the tank runs out and periodically let the filter dry out completely. (And I change the filter every 6 weeks.)I bought this for my daughter's room, but we will only be able to use it during the day, it's just too loud."
4,An excellent overview,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit, depressing as it was. The author did a great job of presenting the relevant information about poverty in this country. It was well-written, so even though it was a required text for a class I didn't mind reading the entire thing. Buy it if you're interested in the subject matter at all."
1,DONT BUY THIS FROM ABC WHOLESALE,Dont buy from them they will sell you the wrong thing and then not give you a refund even though there store page says they do!!!! Order from CosmeticMall or somewhere else instead!!!!!
5,Great Product,I've been using biosilk for 3 years since I've been straightening it. It really helps keep my hair silky and smelling great! My kids often walk up to me and ask to smell my hair. Love it.
4,Exactly as billed,The product is exactly what I WaS looking for and it was at a great price as well. Thanks a bunch!
3,Not what I'm used to.,Have used this product for years. Purchased this time online because less expensive. Either Biosilk changed the product (which some reviewers seem to say...I prefer the older formula) or this is simply a watered-down product.
3,it's OK,"It works pretty well for smoothing but don't expect a miracle. If you have crazy undecided hair it isn't magical. If you have well defined curly hair it's top notch because it gives those defined curls without the feeling of having too much product in your hair. The only thing I wish I had been warned about was the smell. It smells very strong like cheap perfume and if you use too much, the smell is too much. I get the best results with keeping the smell down and getting results I want if I put it in while my hair is still damp. It's good in a pinch though if you're having a crazy unruly hair day. I like that it doesn't leave any residue. The bottle leaks though so keep it upright. I will probably play around with different types of serums from this line and see if I can find a less smelly one."
4,great product,highly recommended for those who have dry hair. worked like mention in the description. but bit expensive though. but worth money.
1,Not the real deal. Biosilk Silk Therapy,"I was giddy when I paid a low price for this product. It leaves my hair really greasy! I've been using *real* Biosilk Therapy for years and this is NOT the real deal! So I'll repeat, it is not the real product!"
4,Not Really Thick Enough to be a Serum,"I have very thick, curly hair that gets abused daily. I've used my fair share of hair serums/oils...Frizz Ease, Chi, Paul Mitchell, Biosilk, etc. I hadn't used Biosilk in a while, but I remember it being thicker in consistency when I previously used it. I wouldn't even consider it a serum now, it's very watery, more like an oil. It works well and smells great, but it's not as effective as it used to be."
5,I love this stuff,"I love this stuff, I have fine hair and Biosilk is the only produce that doesn't weigh my hair down and it gives it body. It is very expensive and so I stock up on it when I find it on sale."
4,Thanks...,"Good deal. Nice product.....Did wonders on my Type 3/4 Afro-American natural hair. Gave some to my sister who is bi-racial, but has very curly hair and she loves it too. We used just regular ceramic flat-irons along with this product. Still did a great job."
5,great product- smooth as silk hair,"I have thick, dry hair. It gets very frizzy and goes wild in the summer with humidity. This product is the only one that has really helped to get it under control. I love it! It smooths it out, smells great and softens my hands in the process of applying it. I highly recommend it."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE KNOCK OFF product,This was a watered down perfumed version of biosilk. This is not the real thing. Beware purchasing from this vendor.SHouldn't even get a one star.
4,Really like it,I got some of this after working for a lady that always had the prettiest shineto her hair. She said she used Biosilk!It is a great product that really is longlasting. Just be sure if you haven't used itin a few days to shake it up first!
1,"Biosilk is a great, unless it's a fake!","I've been using this product for about 10 years. This is the first time I've ordered it through Amazon. I completely agree with the reviewers that gave it one star. The product you'll be getting is watered down Biosilk! I would be totally turned off by this product had this been my first exposure. The scent is off and it reeks of alcohol, this is not Biosilk! Buy it from a reputable salon. Biosilk comes with a BluePrint ""Pull Here"" on top of the silver seal, this product does not. If you're a long time Biosilk user, do not waste your time; if this your first time ordering, just know that you're probably getting a copycat. You will notice it as soon as you start pouring it onto your hands. The liquid will be very runny, as the alcohol will start pouring out first-Biosilk does not do this."
3,Great product for certain types of hair,"A friend told me to try this product a while back. I have long, curly, thick, course blonde hair.It worked so well for me that I will be a life long customer. A small amount while your hair is wet works wonders and sometimes I add a little more when my hair is dry for an extra silky look. It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking along with a smooth frizz free all day style.The results were so good for me that I recommended it to a friend who had fine, thin slightly wavy hair and the product made her hair look greasy even with a very small amount. I on the other hand have to go seriously overboard before it looks greasy on my hair.Basically I think its a great product but if you have thin, fine hair ask your hair stylist to try some on your hair before you purchase a bottle. I honestly don't think this product is for all hair types but the ones who can wear it will be very pleased with the results."
1,This is not Biosilk,The product does not have the same consistency as the real Biosilk. It's very runny as if it's been diluted with baby oil which is probably why it's so inexpensive. I will not order Biosilk from this particular vendor again.
2,Not the Best,"I have purchased two bottles over the years used a little, used a lot, used it on wet hair, used it on dry hair. It would be shiny and soft at first and by two hours it would make my hair dull looking like I hadn't washed it same with my daughter's hair. I still have more than half of my second bottle left. My hairdresser used Sabino Moisture Block on my hair about 3 years ago and I instantly fell in love with it. It is like Biosilk but it is lighter and makes my hair incredibly shiny and soft with staying power. The bottle is smaller but you don't have to apply as much as you do for Biosilk. I like to apply a tiny amount to dry hair, friends always make comments on how shiny my hair is. The only reason I would consider Biosilk is if they ever stopped making Sabino it costs $20 here on Amazon and it is worth twice that amount because it lasts a looooonnnggg time!"
1,Fake product. Stay away from this,Fake product. I bought a lot of things from Amazon.com and this is the first time I received fake product.So disappointed
1,Watery,This is a watered down fake bottle of Biosilk. The real one is thicker and smells a lot better than this one.
3,Biosilk Silk Therapy Serum,"I bought this because I had used it before. When it arrived, I opened the bottle to try some on my hair. The fluid was VERY WATERY! It used to be thicker, like an oil. Also, it was heavily perfumed. I can't wait to wash it out of my hair. I don't think my hair looks any less frizzy either. I wish I hadn't bought it."
2,not like pic,"I bought this one because the pic was of the bottle I wanted. However, the bottle that came was different."
5,Biosilk Therapy Serum,"I've used this anti-frizz serum for a long time and although I've tried others, I always keep coming back to this one. It's light and effective."
3,Okay,"This product to me is just okay not out of this world great. For the money i thought it would be exceptional but their are alot of other products that are cheaper and work just as well. A word to the wise unless you have very long hair, dont add much of this product to it or you will end up with a greasy looking mess."
5,silky soft sensation,"I can't rave enough, about this product. It rescued my hair, and now it is in the best condition of my entire life. I have slightly past my shoulder length curly, thick (very very very thick) hair. I mix a quarter sized amount of this (as directed by my stylist) with my curl cream and wow--perfect hair all day into the evening. No frizz, no undefined limp curls. love this. I do have to say, this probably wouldn't be suited for anyone with limp, fine hair. This smells good, and I often put some on my shoulders/arms/legs and back too, as it is also for the body!"
1,NOT the real thing!!!,"I have used Silk Therapy for many years, and it is an outstanding product. This is the first time I have ordered it from Amazon. Silk Therapy is thick and smells like roses; the product I received was as thin as water, and smells like alcohol. It is not the real thing."
4,Smooth as Silk,"Silky smooth. That's the best way to describe my hair after using this wonderful product. My cupboards are full of beauty products that haven't delivered, but Biosilk Therapy Serum is definitely one that I'll turn to again and again. I use it in conjunction with the hair dryer and a round brush on some days and with a flat iron on others. Even with the harsh heat generated by both items, my hair remains so soft! I don't typically take the time to write reviews, but this is one product that I love. One word of caution, though. Using too much tends to leave the hair a bit oily. I've found that a dime-size portion is perfect.Pro's:Protects hair from high-heat of dryers and ironsSilky smooth locksCon's:PriceyUsing too much leaves fine hair a bit oily"
1,Something's not right...,"My daughters and I have used Biosilk Silk Therapy for a quite a few years. This silk therapy has its own distinct smell and consistency. I thought to save a few dollars and purchase online...unfortunately, I think there's something fishy going on. The products I received did not have that distinct silk therapy smell and even more...when it's poured out into your palm, there's a watery consistency at first followed by the serum...if you can picture oil and water not mixing!! Will not be purchasing these again unless it's from a reputable store."
1,Do Not Order from Quick E Shop!,"I ordered this item from Quick E Shop, and the product in the bottle was NOT Biosilk. It had the wrong consistency, smelled like rubbing alcohol, and was not the same product that I have purchased from salons. You should not order from this vendor."
5,Great Item.....,"I purchased this product for my wife and my two daughters that have long delicate and silky hair, immediately after my wife applied this to my daughters hair you could see a bright shine to it and when running your fingers through they're hair it was surprisingly very silky and smooth feeling. My wife already asked for me to purchase more of this product......final comment.....this stuff is awesome would recommend and have recommended to everyone (well my wife has)."
2,Disappointed,"This product is difficult to sqeeze out of the bottle, need to use a lot of product to condition hair and just not happy with results. Hair seems stringy and has fly aways after use."
2,Before you put this on your hair.........,"I used to use this product religiously! I loved it, then I this happened..... I was on an airplane to Vegas to meet my husband there. I had put all of my products into one bag (no, I don't fly often.) So I had my hair supplies along with my make-up. Well, when I got to the hotel to touch up I realized that my bottle of biosilk had exploded in my make-up bag. A huge mess, but what really bothered me was when I was clean off all of my make-up that I could salvage I realized that the biosilk removed all of the labels and print on the bottles of make-up and other hair products. In short, why would I want to put something on my hair that removes print that has been typed onto a bottle or removes the labels?"
5,This stuff leaves my hair looking and feeling awesome!,"I really love this stuff, as it leaves my hair looking and feeling awesome. My hair used to stick up a bit in the middle, but with this, it stays perfect and easy to manage all day long without feeling greasy or using any hardening gels or sprays."
1,Poor quality,"The product I received was thin like water, not at all the high quality serum I have purchased before in retail stores, by the same brand name. Not sure if this was simply a defective bottle or if the overall quality of the product has gone down, but I was definitely disappointed and wish I hadn't spent the money."
3,"Fine, but make sure you notice size","Great product, for those who have used/purchased it for someone else, but the size is really small. Make sure you read through the size before ordering (unless you really want a tiny bottle showing up at your door)"
1,"Fake product, smell like the petroleum","I ordered the 5.64oz one. It is a good deal compared to the one sold in Kroger and Target, but it is not the one claimed in the picture when I received the product. It is not the silk therapy and does not have the fragrance like what I bought in Kroger and Target. It is diluted and has a petroleum smell. Fake product! Disappointed!!!"
2,Very watery,"I agree with a previously written review. I have never used the product before but I was disappointed when I tried to pour a little in my hand. It is the 5.64 ounce and poured like water! I won't try to return it because of the previous reviewers experience. I would like to try the smaller size to compare but it is not Amazon Prime and I don't want to pay the outrageous shipping price. I think there should be a 'comparison' study. If the smaller bottle has a thicker consistency, an explanation is definitely needed!"
5,Unfindable in stores,So you just get used to the same haircare products that were such a great price to introduce you to them and the prices go skyhigh. Looked online and voile same product for way less and no gas.
3,Really intense perfume smell - meh,"The smell of this product is really powerful for me. I understand that others may be not as sensitive as I am about smells, example: I can't wear perfume sometimes because it causes to me to sneeze a lot.So, if you are not sensitive to smells, this works okay. I think it works just as well as Paul Mitchell's skinny serum, which I am going back to. I just like it the skinny serum better."
1,product appears to be a copycat,I have alway purchased my biosilk therapy at Costco and decided to try to find it on-line. The product that I use isnot watery at all and this one seems to mostly water. I will not buy from this retailer again as beleive it to be a copy-cat version.
2,Not the quality you find at a salon,This seemed watered down. It says shake well on the top and you really do have to shake it which I have never had to do before with the salon biosilk. It still does a decent job on my hair but I feel like I got ripped off.
1,"maybe a defect, waterish","I got the 2.2oz one, which is exactly what I expected. Then I ordered the bigger 5.64 oz. It's waterish, not like the oil in the 2.2 oz. It's so waterish that there is no way to get ""a small amount"" in your hand! The cap is defect too, as there is always a large amount (some from side of the cap) get on my hand no matter how careful I am. I wanted to do exchange but Amazon doesn't allow as the product is actually sold by 3rd but serviced by Amazon. The only choice is to return this one, and Amazon change 1/3 of the product price for shipping. I thought if the produce is defect, the shipping is free. This sucks! It's the same as I just let Amazon charge me $6 for nothing."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER -- FAKE PRODUCT,"I have bought this item in stores before, and know what the mixture should look/feel like. When I got mine from Amazon in the mail, the top was taped up with scotch tape--not a good sign. Sure enough, the mixture appeared to have been heavily diluted with either water or rubbing alcohol--it was all water at the top. I tried to pour some in my hands to use it (and this is after shaking it vigorously) and it was literally like I was pouring straight water out. The real mixture should be thin but gel-like. This product was a total ripoff and I'm surprised; Amazon has never let me down before.Don't buy from here!"
5,The silkiest hair and smell great,"My girlfriend switched me to this products a while ago and I love it. I have pretty thin hair that tend to fly all over the place at a smallest gust of wind. So annoying. It gets stuck to my lipstick... and then I get pink moustache. This product helps to weigh my hair down a bit that prevent it flying everywhere. it smells great too, sort of fruity. A bit expensive, but this small bottle lasts quite a while."
5,Great hair product,"There are many products out there for smoothing hair. Biosilk Silk Therapy is one of the best; this product can be used on all different types of hair from long, short, strait, curly, frizzy, to all different ethnic backgrounds. This product can also be used on children that have hair that is not tamed. This product is also good for individuals that are constantly straightening their hair with a flat iron. I have used this product on my children as well as friends and family that have asked me to do their hair, I have never been disappointed and either has anyone that I have known that has used this product. This product is used in salons all over the country as well as sold in salons and all your local grocery store as well as online. I recommend this product to anyone that uses a silk therapy serum; this product contains no alcohol so it will not dry out your hair like most other products."
2,Disappointing,"This album was boring and bland. I bought it because I very much liked Conjure One's first album (I thought it sounded similar to Balligomingo's Beneath the Surface- somewhat pop, but very melodic and soothing too), but this album wasn't nearly as good. 'Endless Dream' is the only good song, and maybe 'Extraordinary Way'. The rest aren't bad, but aren't interesting, either. I reserve this album for background music."
3,"It's alright, but not the greatest","If Extraordinary Ways were a TV station, it would be Lifetime for Women...mild entertainment in a pinch. That's the best way I can best describe it. Certainly not the greatest work from Rhys. There are some captivating moments here and there...but waiting for them is a difficult task for my attention span.The debut album was much better...and Delerium (which is not only Rhys Fulber, but Bill Leeb as well) is even that much better...and FLA is on an even higher plane of excellence (both Delerium and FLA have new 2006 albums in the works by the way). Extraordinary Ways was definitely engineered to reach the feminine being.My respects go out to Rhys tho, for singing in the track: ""I Believe"" (which is quite well), something he's not done before...at least in this fashion."
1,Quite a disappointment from the first album!,"I must admit to being an obsessed Delerium fan. When the first Conjure One album was released, I was reasonable pleased with the direction I felt the artist was headed.Bought the second and was totally disappointed - nothing ""magic"" in this one! Didn't even live up to being just another Delerium theme work, fell far short of that AND offered nothing in the line of growth."
4,Extraordinarily good!,"If you have enjoyed Delerium then you are pretty much guaranteed to like this album. I have always liked Delerium but my only complaint with their style is it's ""relentlessly upbeat drowning in sugaryness."" Yes, you will find Conjure One to be a bit faster and darker in some corners, which is a good thing - you can't enjoy the light without some darkness to define it, right? All the better to trance and dance too...Extraordinary Ways has wonderful vocals, lush orchestrations (listen to Pilgrimage a few times and it's Delerium deja vu all over again, but with a wonderful dark twist), and excellent engineering that left me feeling very satisfied that I found a few new ""five star"" tunes for my iPod.Enjoy!"
5,Beautiful and haunting,"This album is fantastic. It's perfect for just about everything - reading, driving, eating dinner, just listening... The layers and textures used in the songs make this album really stand out. I liked Conjure One's debut album, but this one just blew me away."
1,Chimera revisited,"Being a huge fan of the first Conjure One CD (it's still in my car's changer), I was excited when heard about this CD. That is, until I listened to it. Just like Chimera, this CD went the way of boring, uninspired and unoriginal pop garbage. A huge disappointment."
2,Not too good for a workout.,"First of all, I LOVE MaDonna Grimes. Her personality is fun, and she is a fabulous choreographer. However, this DVD should not be called a workout. It's more about learning to street dance. There are seven 8-counts in the routine, and MaDonna teaches them in a way that is not cardio. She slows it WAY down to teach it to you, then gradually speeds it up. Meanwhile, there is NO music going in the background. Eventually she turns on music and you do this 8-count really fast for about 3-4 minutes which does elevate the heart rate before she slows it WAY down again to teach you the next 8-count. MaDonna is friendly and the choreography is really 90's street. I love the choreography and MaDonna, I just do not feel that this is a sufficient workout."
1,A thoroughly substandard guide,"I bought this guide for my son as a gift, and have since received nothing but complaints from him in europe. He says that for reliability, insight, quality of maps and other information, his firends' guides are far superior. He asked for the Lonesome Planet, but on the salesman's recommendation, I chose this one instead. A mistake, I've learned. Caveat Emptor!"
1,Stick to the tried and trues!,"Anyone who wants to try to write a guidebook has a high standard to meet. The old reliables (which will go unnamed here) are just super-dependable and well-researched. This book, as I know unfortunately now from experience, feels like a slap-dash job. Using no other guide book -- not even an out-dated Let's Go -- have I run into as many mistakes, bad judgments and outright false leads as I did using this one. I only travelled to eastern europe and greece, so I don't know about the sections on france, spain, england, etc. But a book not written by pros (and one glance at the authors' bios will show you this one was not) ought to come with some sort of disclaimer. At least Let's Go uses Harvard kids. I will be writing a letter of complaint to the publisher."
2,"Great picture, poor sound","I bought this DVD to branch out from the popular WAVES series, of which I own the ""Hawaiian Dreams"" & ""Hawaiian Zen"" discs. Compared to these videos, ""Soothing Waters - California and Oregon"" offers superior picture quality and more frequent cuts from scene to scene.However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the audio quality detracts significantly. Wind noise is prominent; anyone who has ever made a home movie outdoors with an inexpensive video camera knows this disturbing, thunder-like rumbling all too well. I can also attest to the fact that, at least with a decent audio setup, cars and people can clearly be heard in the background.This would be a great disc, if only the audio were as professional as the video. As it currently stands, I would recommend the WAVES Virtual Vacation series videos instead."
2,Quite disappointed,"I bought this DVD based on the high recommendations of the other reviewers. All I can say is that I was very disappointed in the quality of the video. I wanted something that would look beautiful on my 61 inch Samsung. Almost all of the shots seem to be slighly out of focus, as if they were shot with a cheap camera with a poor lens. I compared this DVD with various beach scenes in movies I have and the scenes in the movies look a lot better! Sure, they use high end film Panovision cameras, but that is the quality I was hoping for. This DVD will be in my next garage sale."
4,Relaxing DVD,"Well photographed, this DVD delivers what it promises. It is what it says... soothing. For someone who likes to fall asleep with the television on, it is perfect. With its hypnotic ocean sounds, and lovely beaches, it tempts one to visit these places."
3,Nice scenery spoiled by too much boom,"I love the scenery, but it is periodically spoiled by too much boom (sound of the the wind). This is worse I think because we have a theater system and the bass really picks that sound up.If I turned the sound off, then I wouldn't hear the gentle sound of the waves either. So it's definitely not my favorite DVD. :-("
4,Excellent,All three dvds were in perfect condition and my husband and I had never seen any of these movies before and they were all very good. Thank you.
4,Clark Gable collection,"Remastered version of Call of the Wild is improved from original, but not markedly. Still, this is a treasure to have."
3,movie fan,I wanted the movie Call of the Wild. The only way I found it waas to purchase this set. I don't really like the other two movies in the set.
1,anamorphic or not,Seeing as 20th Century Fox is advertising The true Story of Jesse Jaemes in its upcoming release in March as 1.33 ratio I would like to know from anyone if The Tall Men and Soldier of Fortune are Anamorphic as the info on here states all 3 films are 1.33. I collect all CinemaScope films from 1953 to 1967 but why does Fox have to release in 1.33?
4,hard to fathom what one mind can imagine,"a very eclectic mix of subject matter, but bentley little demonstrates why he is a rising talent in the horror/suspense genre. who else can juxtapose a fornicating pillow with a family that goes a little too nutty about recycling? that's why little is one of my favorites."
4,"Stop comparing him to Stephen King, he is better!","I was suprised by the short stories I just read. I just finished The Collection by Bentley Little. This was my first exposure to the author. He is one demented person. I love it! everyone compares him to Stephen King and I say he is ten times better than the master of redneck...um..er.. macabre..Mr. Little at times can be boring and too historical, but when he is in top form, he can blow your mind away. His ideas are very original. One can only imagine where he comes up with these delightfully macabre tales. Recommended must-read stories in this book include The Woods Be Dark and The Sanctuary. I guarantee once you start reading this book you will be hooked. great for late night reading. Guaranteed chills!! Enjoy!"
3,Weirdly reminiscent of your worst nightmares.,"In these thirty two stories, you cannot help but wonder if author Bentley Little was just recording his own nightmares. They are, for the most part, too weird to be frightening, although there are a few parts that will bring out the adrenaline. When he is not being scary, he is grossing you out, which is never a bad thing for horror lovers. Unfortunately, I just could not find myself stuck to the pages, it just wasn't that mesmerizing. What I kept thinking of is what my own collection of nightmares written down would be like, and I think they would be similar, if not as vivid. Bentley Little is a fine author who does a good job of putting stories together, but this time I think he could have added a little more reality, a little less abstract extreme, and a lot more depth."
1,"Bad, in so many ways.","The other negative reviews get the main point across on why this book is so bad. What irritated me even further were the ""Little"" opinions he wrote before each story. Save your politics for another time. I read for enjoyment, not to get lectured on things."
5,WOW!!,"Anyone who has not read this book is not a true horror fanatic. This is the most amazing collection of horror stories you will ever read from any author. Bentley Little is a legend in horror fiction, and this is his masterpiece. Read this novel and start on The Store and The Mailman afterwards. You will fall in love with him forever."
3,A Mixed Bag,"Bentley Little's collection of 32 short stories provides good value (450 or so pages) for fans of the genre looking for bite sized nuggets of squeamish and horrific delights. Fans of Little, familiar with his oeuvre, may be slightly disappointed with the overall quality of these stories when compared to the higher-quality of story telling and atmosphere found in his excellent collection of novels. These short stories, originally published in the span of 1986 - 1996, are truly a mixed bag with a few standouts, a bunch of stinkers and a plethora of ho-hummers. A nice touch to this collection is the author's inclusion of brief intros to each story explaining his motivation and inspiration in writing each tale. Recommended for fans already familiar with Little's works."
2,WHERE'S THE HORROR????,"THIS BOOK IS GOOD IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A FEW LAUGHS. BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BE SCARED AND COMPLETELY TERRIFIED THAN THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU. I SUGGEST MAYBE STEPHEN KING'S ""NIGHT SHIFT""."
2,Next day!,"I order the item to recv. It next day and I paid too much for that, unforctionatly I didn't recv. It on time."
1,journey to louisana,Foux Zydaco I don't think this band has ever been to the US let alone New Orleans
3,Fun to use but not accurate,This 6mm paintball/BB gun hold quite a few BBs and is easy to pump and shoot. Mine soots about one foot to the right every 20-30 feet. Taking that into acccount you can ballpark a large target from 50 feet. It comes with a flashlight and laser beam. The laser is good at night but only to look at. The BB doesn't come anywhere near it. Overall it's good for chasing off critters from your bird feeder without hurting them. It's also fun for breaking up cat fights at night. I don't think I've ever hit one but it does scare them off. It does shoot hard enough to put out an eye at close range!
4,Cool Shotgun - Not very durable,I bought this shotgun because it was dirt cheap. The scope is a toy along with the laser (not accurate at all). But the shotgun itself is fairly powerful and fun to use. The clip is fake and you load bb's from the top right beneath the fake scope. The shotgun itself is made of a crappy plastic and lasted a long time but i hit it against my best post one day when i was pissed and it literally snapped in half.
3,Toy,"The product photographs well. It looks like a cheap plastic toy in your hands, but at this price, it is a good toy. It comes with maybe 30 BB's, a cheap goggle, laser pointer, blue flash all batteries included and a small screw driver needed for assembly. I read how the laser sight breaks in one day of use, and mine was no different, although I can't imagine how they can manage to make it like that. Something wrong with the wiring. It won't turn on, and now it won't shut off, so I had to take the batteries out. It was cool while it worked, though. very bright. It fires BB's fine, though not very accurate. I guess I'm mostly dissapointed about the way it looks and feels....... But let's face it, you'll need to dish out a lot more for a sturdy feeling functional ""replica""."
3,"cheap,light weight","Ok for the price, batteries came corroded. Typical Chinese junk. Can't find anyhing made in the US anymore. Thanks to our politicians."
2,cheaply made and shoots all over the place,"This gun is very cheaply made. when you shoot it is sounds like its about to break and its really light and flimsy not robust like other guns of this type. to the reader of this review i advis you to look at other shot guns like the crossman stinger s30, the hardballer 2, and or the utg model 870. look for other guns."
2,wooow,i cant belive they made a gn cheap!!! i was playing with it and the laser fell of when i dropped it on the grass then the next night i was running and THE BARREL SNAPPED OFF IT SNAPPED OFF WOOOW!!! If u r considering this gun because it 'looks cool' i would try a different gun because it doesent shoot cool either ... it ALWAYS curves i never hit my friends in our airsoft war LOOK AT A DIFFERENT GUN!!!
1,If i could give it zero i would,"My friend who i go airsoft with all the time just bought this gun, we were so excited to play, and when he opened it out of the box, 9 days after he ordered it cuz it took really long, it was messed up, he says that when you put the pelletes in the mag. wen he points the gun straight or down, they fall out, and when he holds it up and pulls the triger, it doesnt even shoot, i am really dissapointed, so get a different gun, i reccomend for beginers, any gun from hot import toys, and if ur experienced, tokyo maruips. my friend and i both ordered the same gu from amazon, and his came in 4 days, and its been 8 days for me and hasnt come, so it can be two or it can be 9, he orderd a speed loader, didnt come for 2and a half weekspps. im not a kid"
3,Sun drenched sounds of the Mangue beat...,"NOTE (in the absence of a tracklisting on this page): This is a 2007 French import compilation of the best tracks from their earlier two Brazilian albums 'Original Olinda Style' (2003) & 'Metropolitano' (2006), available indivdually on Amazon on Brazilian import. Contains ''Pode me Chamar'', promoted off the album and in support of their European tour at the time of the album's release."
5,Oldy But Goody,"I grew up watching Pollyanna, so I decided that I HAD to have it for my collection. I just re-watched it yesterday and remembered why it was one of my favorites.Pollyanna's parents die and she must go live with her rich aunt Polly. Pollyanna is so optimistic, but everyone in Harrington Town is so pessimistic and it's all because of strict aunt Polly. Pollyanna tries to turn the town around by teaching them the glad game - basically the idea of being optimistic. It's a cute story and teaches a good lesson.My only complaint - for a Disney movie it is LONG! 2 hours and 15 minutes."
1,of no value,"I emailed & canceled the order as after 3 weeks, I had not received the tape of Pollyanna. On July 30th I received the CD, and tried to see the movie, and could not as it came from over seas, along with the fact that it was not published for the US. It was a Europeon Movie, that had pal on it. I packaged it back up for return to sender. I have received my money back, and after I month from ordering the movie, I am very disappointed. I will still order things but will make sure they come from the US.Jan Duff"
5,Pollyanna,"Brings back good memories. Movie is good for the spirit, it is wise to always look at the bright side of life. Pollyanna is for the young & older alike."
4,A kids movie you can let them watch without worrying,"How refreshing to show the kids a movie without anyone getting kicked in the groin, smartass kids whose attitudes are supposed to be funny or questionable language! This is a wonderful, pick-up-your spirits movie with a beautiful performance by Halley Mills. The small-town setting and the message that you can always find something to be glad about make this a terrific movie for children who haven't become jaded after seeing the typical fare that passes for kids entertainment these days. My 13-, 12- and 3-year-olds loved it and my husband and I ended up watching with them just because it was so enjoyable. Jane Wyman, Karl Malden and Agnes Moorhead have fun with their roles as townspeople transformed by Pollyanna's relentlessly sunny outlook on life. This is the type of film that, regrettably, isn't made anymore."
1,Bogus buy,Movie did not play! Couldn't play in my region! Well you shouldn't sell to my region! Probly not at all
5,KAREN MOVER LOVER,"I really enjoy this movie, and Hailey Mills is great in it. I love the scene in which Karl Maldens character finally becomes the minister he should of been along, by endosing the Fair. I saw the 2004 Masterpiece adaption, and I like this one as well, almost as this one. Some of the reviews call the Disney movie as too sweet, and one said tha Hailye Mills performance was forced and too old for the role, well I disagree, there is nothing forced about her performance and she is not too old. I recomend this movie, and well of course you could purchase the other, there are differences, but they are not bad, and so in my view you won't regret it, but again in my view, the Disney movie is number one, with the 2004 adaption a close second."
5,Great fo families,My 7 and 6 year old girls and my 5 year old boy love this movie. It is set in a time when things were innocent for children. Hayley Mills is wonderful as pollyanna. She is full of joy and creative thought and very mature for her age. I can't think of the boy's name but he has been in many movies such as Old Yeller and Swiss Family Robinson. Pollyanna brings love to her stuck up proud money flaunting aunt and the whole town falls in love with pollyanna. I don't mind my kids watching this because it has great values and morals and lessons to be learned by all ages. Definatly suggest getting for movie night.
4,Not as good as the book,"My daughter is 9 and loves this story. We read the book before ordering the movie and she couldn't put it down. The movie is very Disneyish with the colorful sets, simple characters and plot modifications to make the story ""better"". We are always on the lookout for good wholesome movies for our daughter and in that respect, I can recommend this one. But I highly recommend you read the book first. If you like this one, you can read Heidi next."
5,pollyanna,i loves this movie andthe stars who played the movie brought chills to my spine when pollyanna fell from the tree
5,Pollyanna,We are in the process of updating our collection of Disney movies to DVD. We no longer own a VCR to watch them on tape.
5,All time favorite movie,I would recommend this movie to anyone Always been my favorite Can watch it over and over. would recommend this movie for everyone
5,Lesson for life,Circle the way to look upon your life. The movie helps clearify that values and basic positive point of view can change the colors of life.
5,Pollyanna,I have always enjoyed & liked Disney movies. If I had my wayI would always get disney movies. You can't go wrong with disneyfilms.
1,wont work,"I bought this and had my niece over so we could watch it together as we both love this movie. It wouldnt play on my dvd player - it comes up with an error message saying ""wrong code"" . sigh.."
3,Likeable story,"The story of Pollyanna is very likeable. It centers around a new girl in town who is very refreshing with her positive outlook on things. The color is vibrant and the characters very funny. Oddly enough, even though she won an academy award, I think the casting of Haley Mills in the title role was a mistake. She doesn't come across as genuinely likeable as the character calls for. And she spends most of the movie with a scrunched up face that's almost a scowl. It contrasts greatly with what the Pollyanna personality calls for. However, it is nonetheless an enjoyable movie. A great family film."
1,This is not the story of Pollyanna,"I was horrified when I saw this movie version of the book. They changed everything about the characters except their names. Yes, Pollyanna is glad, but it fails to capture the essence of her struggle to be glad when she is faced with so much adversity. Miss Polly is not ruthless and conniving and does not influence the town as depicted in the movie. She is struggling herself, which is where Pollyanna comes into the picture. My children were flabbergasted at seeing this film. They knew the characters and these were *not* them. The plot is so skewed that you will miss it if you see this film. Do yourselves a favor and get the BBC version, or better yet, read the book. It is truly a delightful story that you will cherish."
5,A Story That cherishes your heart,"This film, although very different from The book is a must to your Disney films collections. Hayley Mills Recieved an OScar for he role which i must admit was like eating 'Norwegin smoked salmon and Iranian Caviar toppeld with bubbling Champagne'. I think that this film deservs to be cherished over again and again."
5,What a darling movie!,"This movie is so good! I thought no movie could be better than those of Shirley Temple, and I was always hoping a film similar to Heidi would be released. Luckily I found ""Pollyanna"" on DVD. Wow! I sort of pushed my Shirley Temple gift set near the back and brought forth my new Vault Disney DVD collection. Pollyanna is very similar to Heidi and I recommend it to fans of that movie. This movie is about a little orphan girl-Pollyanna-who is sent to live with her strict aunt. Everyone in the town is always grumpy, but Pollyanna teaches them her ""glad game"" and makes everyone lovable and cheerful. Only at the end of the movie when a terrible tragedy takes place, does everyone realise how much they appreciate Pollyanna. A wonderful family film that isn't only for children, but for adults too. The DVD comes with lots of documentaries, interviews, pictures, and some music too! Even a commentary! Trust me, fans of Shirley Temple may also appreciate Hayley Mills too!"
4,Cute movie,I got this for my niece and she enjoyed it. A neighbor borrowed it and liked the message of being positive.
3,Classic Disney Syrup!,"She made our town smile again! This is a little much for jaded 20,30-somethings but it has its place. Jane Wyman seemed a little too real in this movie, It became easy to see why she became Mrs Ex-Ronald Reagan."
1,pollyanna,"I have always loved this movie, however the DVD sent to me says ""disc error will not play in your region"" I can not locate my receipt, but I would love to have it replaced!!!!Please let me know where to send DVD to for replacement. thanks!!!!!"
4,I'm Glad I Saw This Movie,"This is a delightful film for folks of all ages. The Glad Game is not a game -- it's a way of life, a positive attitude. When young Pollyanna and her father were disappointed that the package from a missionary relief organization contained not a doll but crutches, they determined they would find something to be glad about. After a bit of thought, they decided to be glad they didn't NEED the crutches! At the end of the show, though, when Pollyanna is unable to walk due to an injury sustained falling from a tree, you have to think she would have been glad to have had those crutches."
5,Pollyanna,"This movie is my all-time favorite childhood. I had the sound track and played it so much that I still have it memorized (I drove my parents NUTS!), . It's a wonderful movie and I still pull it out to watch it often! If you've never seen it, get it for your kids."
3,not funny,"i thought that his book was boring and not entertaining. i didn't laugh once while reading the book, and i almost fell asleep towards the end."
2,*Not* a Comprehensive Treatise on Web Audio,"I'm sorry, but the surfer-dude quality of the prose in this book started to wear on me after a while. More importantly, and perhaps most devestatingly, the author confesses 400 pages in that he doesn't know HTML, and therefore can only give you the vaguest notion of how to actually put sound on the web.A better title for this book would have been: ""Hey, Let's Convert Sound Files So that Someone Could Put Them on the Web, If They Knew How!"""
3,For smart people,If you aint at least in college you shouldnt pick this up . note you really do need a survial expert a former soldier and a fitness trainer to unlock the true potential for this book .it has some useful things but mostof it is outdated .
2,"Not what you think it is, going by the title","Although this might be a great book for someone, it's not at all what I thought it would be, I actually thought it would teach the fundamentals on fighting, well maybe if it were world war ll, it describes fighting in a war situation, no everyday street and survival fighting, if someone was off to war in another country then this might be the book for them, it offers nothing to the regular Joe off the street, very disappointed,"
2,Make sure to look beyond the title of this book!,"Here we have yet another of the seemingly endless flood of books that emblazon ""SAS"" on the cover as a misleading sales pitch. For the most part, this book is *not* about the Special Air Service -- instead it covers special forces operations in general. If you are looking for material specifically on the SAS, or specifically on SAS fighting techniques (which the title seems to promise), pass this one up..."
5,Burnin' Quartet,"This hard bop date is led by exciting tenor saxist Paul Kendall. Dave Jackson, currently in T.S. Monk's band is on bass. Alvester Garnett, Formerly with Cyrus Chestnut is on drums. Matthew Fries, Great American piano competition winner is on piano. A great listen"
1,Using your 401 to invest,"I think that I know less about the topic after having read the book than before I read it. The first few chapters offered some vague generalities on the topic. The last several were merely examples of forms supposedly used in such transactions. While the author may know the topic (judging from his bio), this book is useless."
5,good,Bought this for my 4 yr old grandson after him watching charlie and chocolate factory over an over. He loves being the oompa lumpas in his new costume
4,RANSOM WAS GREAT,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE, MEL GIBSON WAS GREAT IN IT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL MY FRIENDS. IT KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT RIGHT TO THE END. TWISTS AND TURNS ALL THE WAY THROUGH."
1,BORING,Am I the only one in the world who thought this movie was as entertaining as a funeral? I guess so.
2,Pass the time,"ENOUGH with the ""cat and mouse"" expression! Anyway, this is another ""Hollywood"" movie. Very unrealistic, many times during the movie you will be thinking ""that would NEVER happen"". The beginning of the movie we see dad and son play around, laugh, and and have fun, as if that is a typical every day for them. (Who hasn't seen that 20 times before?)This DVD was given a special edition, but I am unsure why. The featurette is boring, 3/4 of it are clips we've just seen from the movie.Overall, sure it's mildly entertaining if you can ignore how unbelievable it is."
1,my DVD was stolen,"I'm not sure about this particular DVD because after it was delivered to my house, someone took it. I didn't even get to open or watch the movie. I've seen it through borrowing from people or libraries-it's one of my favorite MEL GIBSON movies."
1,WATCH OUT! This title is NOT anamorphic!,"While I think the movie is great, I thought everyone should be warned that this is the exact same non-anamorphic transfer as the previous release. Amazon's technical details are in error. The back is absent of any 16x9 markings. Popping the movie in confirmed this. Stay away if you're looking to upgrade from the first disc."
5,yeah mel,Kept me involved and cheering on Mel's character. If only we all had that kind of stones. I can enjoy seeing it again.
3,Decent thriller with a superb cast,"Ransom features two of my all-time favorite actors-Mel Gibson and Gary Sinise-facing each other off in a game of cat-and-mouse. Naturally, my expectations for the film should be high. While the film does have its thrilling sequences, there are also needless subplots and repellent violence and tone. There are also a lack of surprises, as everything plays in a manner that's not too hard to guess.As should be expected, the acting in the film is superb, with Gibson delivering a powerful performance as the flawed man who only wishes to get his son back. Rene Russo as his wife also shows strength and passion. Equalling Gibson's performance is the terrific Gary Sinise, who plays his villainous character to perfection (or rather imperfection), a guy you just love to hate.Though far from perfect and the occasionaly stilted direction from Ron Howard, the great cast and some suspenseful sequences make this film worth a look"
2,Another lousy Ron Howard movie,"Bad. Really bad. Only Gary Sinise manages to save this nearly unbearable flick. Avoid it. It is silly, predictable, and revels in violence. For an interesting movie with a similar plot, watch Kurosawa's High and Low."
1,Where's the director's cut?,"How can this be a special edition when they didn't bother to include the director's cut of the film? They released it on the Ransom laserdisc years ago with an extra 18 minutes added back into the film. With so many studios re-releasing movies left and right these days, maybe we'll see a another special edition of Ransom come out in the future...this time done right. With any luck it will include the director's cut that so many fans of the film want on DVD."
5,"Not Perfect, but Close","This film was a little too typical for my tastes. The characters follow too many of the same motions as have already been carried out in many other movies by many other characters. There wasn't much originality. That doesn't mean that this wasn't a good film. The cast is filled with strong actors, and they really make theis film work."
5,Super,I have wanted this movie for my library for years!! Now I have it and know that I will watch it many times.
3,Not as good as I expected,"I also felt the story fell flat! There was so much hype about this movie. I think the acting was fine, and as a mother, my heart went out to the parents of the kidnapped child and I thought the movie showed a realistic view of what I imagine kidnappers might do to their victim. I, like another viewer, felt like Mel Gibson's character should have used his wits to battle these evil beings, rather than being the somewhat ""wishy-washy"" character he was. It just wasn't one of my favorites movies."
4,Ransom - Special Edition,"One of the classic Mel Gibson films, ""Ransom"" is one of those movies which are no longer made nowadays. With a Mel Gibson in the best moment of his career, an exciting story and a great supporting cast, this film provides great entertainment as well as fantastic interpretations. The tension is very well built up, leading to an exciting climax with a fantastic final battle, and in whole the film is a great example of what the action-thriller genre used to be.As for the edition, it provides a great variety of bonus contents which allow us to explore the making of the film and the opinions of the cast.In general, a completely satisfying product which you won't regret to purchase!"
5,Mel Gibson at his best!,"This movie is truly one of best the movies Mel Gibson has ever made. He effectively shows the audience how a father brought to a point of desperation, will do what ever is necessary to save his kidnapped son. It truly is a movie deserving of a five star rating."
5,Highschool Writing Course to use at home,"High school level composition and essay writing book with four sections. They cover the skills and cretivity involved in expository writing. The four sections are:1. The Big Picture: Begins with an emphasis on illutrative writing. It also studies tone, audience and paragraphing. Guides the student through brainstorming to drafting.2. Sentence Fluidity: The student learns to identify and correct awhward sentences and practices word choice, transition and quotations.3. Sentence Combining: These exercises help students economize their writing and emply various sentence structures to give a more sophisticated and creative prose.4. Four Essays: Learning throughout the book is put into use as the student complete four assigned essays.This would be an excellent choice for a homeschool student or other student who needs some extra help with writing skills."
1,Lies Reign Supreme!,"Levine is another re-constructionist of history who evidently believes that Black Confederates were invented on Mars much in the same vein as James McPherson, and his belief that Black Confederates were really ""Just white Confederates with very dirty faces!"" Actually, they both go hand in hand very well with Eric Foner, and his Marxist reinvention of the history of the WBTS. Just go to the Official Records for documented evidence against their revisionist ""beliefs."""
2,A mass delusion,"This book has a lot of interesting history but really misses the point. The thing it might have considered is the rise of the Southern mass-delusion that, despite much evidence, slaves actually loved their masters, were happy and would fight for them. There is rather a dearth of information about what slaves actually thought. The amazing process where Southerners again deluded themselves into thinking that the Civil War was not about slavery but independence is adequately detailed. It is not also made particularly clear that what most people in the CSA were considering was really the exchange of slavery for serfdom. The argument among politicians was very lively but very few seem to have considered real freedom and equality. The word serfdom was not mentioned by contemporaries but Levine does give European parallels."
2,"Lelli Kelly Infant/Toddlers' Ellen Shoe,Green",The shoe was defective due to the inner sole being totally lifted. Amazon sent a replacement but it had the same defect. Product looks good but not as comfortable as other kid brands such as UMI or Stride Rite.

LOVE YA!! PEACE."
4,Good premise,"The book is well done, though I could do without the gross-out factor for the ""V"" superhero. My son is more excited about the superheros and the illustrations than the letters, but it's a unque way of getting him interested in the sounds the letters make."
5,GREAT fun book for boys and girls!,"This book is ""Sooooo awesome"" according to my son's Kindergarten class. His teacher said all the kids love it and they get to take turns saying the letters and phonics. It's a must have for a any Kindergarten teachers or a great birthday gift for 4-6 year old! Plus, you can't beat the price! Enjoy! :o)"
1,A kids book?,"I cannot imagine why this book has received so many positive reviews. I would encourage those who have given it positive responses to return to it with the following thoughts in mind...Why are all the female characters negatively portrayed?The first female has ""fat feet"", the second has ""big lips"", the third is portrayed as a big-mouthed ""yeller"", and one comment on the page of the heroine with the whale is sexualized.Perhaps I am the only one who thinks the messages in this story reinforce negative stereotypes of women.My four-year old daughter pulled this book off the library shelf because it looked colorful and fun, but the messages inside are not ones that I want to perpetuate."
3,"Fantastic illustrations, but story isn't great","This book is a fun way to teach the alphabet to your kids. The illustrations are fabulous and the pages are very exciting, but I felt that the story could be better. It was not as fun to read as it looked."
3,Not your usual Disney fare,"I must say, the first time I saw this movie in a theatre I was kind of taken aback. It did not seem the type of movie a child would like. The very disturbing middle part I found a bit puzzling. How to reconile the violence and negativity with Walt Disney. In retrospect, the story line followed described norms: it had a definite beginning, a middle and a definite end. And Gideon's advice to the little girl about not being concerned about what was to happen I don't think could have been understood by most of the younger children watching. As a Christmas movie, meant to re-create the joy of the season, One Magic Christmas rated a 4 out of a possible 10. That's just me. I am not telling anyone not to obtain this video; just to keep and open mind and compare what I said to what you see."
2,Not cheery and bright,"It is well made and has a good cast, but each time I've watched it, I found it to be depressing. Too much realism regarding the effect unemployment/underemployment can have on a family. Give me movies like Elf, Christmas Story, Miracle on 34th Street instead."
4,A Christmas Tradition,"A family favorite! The story is odd, but it is a Christmas tradition along with Miracle on 34th Street and Holiday Inn, etc.Cowboy angel in the tree might sound creepy, but the story is good and there are no weird outcomes!"
5,THIS IS CHRISTMAS MAGIC,One of the best Christmas movies ever made. This movie always gets us in the mood for Christmas and it's true meaning.
4,Better delivery needed,I ordered several copies of this movie and received them in 3 different shipments. I would like to see them come all together in one shipment. I do appreciate the competitive prices though.
1,Awful,"I love Steenburgen, but even she could not rescue this mess of a movie. At first I thought it had possibilities--the reality of working class people down on their luck at Christmas time--but the whole North Pole-Santa thing just ruined it completely. also the rest of the supernatural stuff. I'm sorry I wasted time watching this."
2,One Magic Christmas,The movie was to slow getting to the main point and it was boring. If there is anyway to be refunded I would appreciate. Thanks!
1,"More like ""One Tragic Christmas"".. Total downer",This movie just keeps getting more an more depressing as you watch it. My wife likes it for some reason.
4,good Christmas movie with a dose of realty.,the movie is a throw back to when Christmas meant something other than gift gift gift and shows hard times.
5,Favorite Christmas Movie,This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time! Filled with Christmas spirit and very heart warming movie that the whole family can watch and love:)
5,One Magic Christmas,I bought this for my daughter - one of her favorite Christmas movies. It was in good condition and shipped on time.
4,Great Birthday Gift,"Purchased as a birthday gift for my wife. If you grew up in 80's you will have fond memories of this movie. Not on the level of ""A Christmas Story"" but definitely entertaining for the whole family. Our kids loved it."
5,An excelent part of our Christmas Tradition,We wore out our first copy of this movie. That was a Beta version. I missed it greatly this year. Please re release so I can enjoy it with my family
5,"Great ""G"" rated Christmas Movie","Even though I buy all my videos and DVDs closed captioned, I bought a non-captioned version of ""One Magic Christmas"" because I enjoyed it so much. But I need it closed captioned, even the DVD is not captioned. I am so disappointed."
5,Great!,"I love this movie, I used to watch it on TV all the time when it was on Disney. The story is about a poor family in Canada and The mother doesn't have any Christmas spirit and is sent one day ahead and realizes that she has more than what money can buy. This is a great christmas movie, I recommend it."
5,The Best Chritmas spirit movie ever!!,By far the best Christmas video ever. No other shows the degree of belief for the holidays.
1,Bad and very unsafe example for Children,"I am a Christmas movies fan!! I watched tens of them and I tell you that I am one of few people who agrees with this review!! it is silly. What a lesson will your children learn from the little girl who trust a stranger that he is really an angel!! Oh No!!!!!!!!!!! now bad guys can pretend to be angels. Do you really like it that you little daughter and son leave the house in the night to talk to a stranger who will convince the mother that Santa is real?!!!!! so mom is the stupid one here who does not believe in Santa!! Do not forget that Santa is the ONE who will bring the father (who got shot during the movie) to life., Let Santa solve our problems and make our children with limited thinking.. All those who watched with me thought it was really silly movie with bad roll models and wrong lessons for children. I am glad my children were old enough to think that it was silly."
1,Huge disappointment,"I am a big Lover of Christmas movies and try to find new movies to add to my collection every year. This movie is a huge disappointment. It cannot be compared to any of the classics; It's a Wonderful life, Miracle on 34th Street, Christmas Carol or even Prancer! There were too many faults to list....my advice would be to steer clear of it and certainly do not watch it with children! The Angel answers to Santa not God!! Stick to the tried and true classics would be my recommendation."
2,One DARK Christmas movie!,"As a fan of Christmas movies, I remember seeing this years ago and watched it again recently. This film was terrible. The plot was far too dark to be enjoyable, and the actors looked completley bored to tears. The little girl was adorable and the only positive thing in this entire movie. There were way too many loose ends that we never tied up and the movie was way to depressing. Harry Dean Stanton is a fine actor but he looked like he would rather be anywhere than this atrocious movie. Mary Steenburgen is a phenominal actor but was TERRIBLE in this role! These actors looked like they were forced to act in this movie and were completly wasted. The effeccts in the film were very hokey and I cannot get over how dark the plot was. The end fails to deliver and punch as well. Avoid this film folks it's dark and boring!"
1,Worst movie I ever purchased,"I was so disappointed with this movie. I knew nothing about it but thought with Mary Steenburgen it would be good. She seemed to be in a daze through most of it and the interaction between the ""Angel"" and the little girl is enough to give any mother nightmares. This must have been made at a really low point for Disney."
2,I'm not watching this twice...,"I bought this movie after reading the other reviews- thinking it would get me in a real christmas spirit. Well, the story is actually quite good -but the acting is really bad! It also seems like a very low budget movie! I give this movie as ""much"" as 2 stars because I think it could be a very good movie if they used other actors and a bit more ""collors""......It is so ""grey"" I almost thougt I was watching an black&white movie..."
5,One Magic Christmas Great movie!,"One of the best Disney Christmas movies ever! Brings back memories of living in Michigan in the 50's It also has a very special message about believing! Not just in Santa either. It kind of makes you think to be happy with your position, it could be a lot worse. Great movie!"
5,heartwarming story,This story keeps you on the edge of your seat. It really makes you stop and think about the thing you hold dear to your heart. The kids played very good parts. They made you believe in Santa.
3,A Not So Great Christmas Movie,"This is an okay movie. I found it disappointing though. The angel answers to the power of Santa Claus instead of God. Before I bought this movie I read a review that compared this movie to, ""It's a Wonderful Life."" It may have a similar theme, but it is no where near as good a movie."
5,ONE Magic Christmas,a movie of what can and could happen to a family when thing just dont seem to go the way thay had hoped but in the end it shows how a family can make it happen.
5,EXCELLENT!!,"The ""magic"" in One Magic Christmas is often (and surprisingly) of the ""black"" variety. Like Jimmy Stewart before her, worn-out wife and mother Mary Steenburgen wishes that she'd never been born. And like Stewart, Steenburgen is visited by a guardian angel, in this case the western-garbed Harry Dean Stanton. Instead of granting Steenburgen's wish, Stanton shows her what life would be like without Christmas-and that vision is as grim as anything you're ever likely to see in any Holiday film. Throughout the horrendous tragedies heaped upon Steenburgen, we are comforted in the knowledge that Stanton is working in concert with Steenburgen's young daughter. Steenburgen learns her lesson of course, but what a ride!"
5,Great Christmas Movie,"A movie I have looked for I finally found, Bought as a gift also.A Favorite of mine A make you feel good Christmas movie. Great!!!"
5,FANTASTIC Christmas Movie!!,"Have you ever thought of what the world would be like, if you had never exsisted? This is not a miracle on 34th street. It is so different. And I just ADORE, Mary Steenburgen. She is a fantastic actress and did an incredible job in this movie as well. Her life was a mess, her husband was shot and killed, the same man stole her car with her children in it, and then the man driving way too fast on icy roads slid off a bridge into the river......I won't spoil the rest of the story, but as she is walking down the street very depressed, all the Christmas lights went out.... and the day started over. She was given a chance to start the day again.I highly recommnend this movie... it would be awesome if we could all be given a chance to do just one day over .... how our lives would change.Awesome movie.... Get it!!!!"
4,An Exellent Christmas Movie!,This is an excellent film. Just remember that it was made before CGI and other digital equipment. The story is one that will hit you square in the chest and make you realize that things around us aren't as bad as they seem.
2,Disappointing,I enjoy Christmas movies but this one missed the mark. The plot was not believable nor a good fantasy. Although Steenburgen held the movie together the script itself seemed disjointed and unbelievable. How could she think her husband was dead and he shows up in the end? Didn't she communicate with the police or the hospital after the accident?
3,Magic Christmas,"What a great story. This is my second copy, (needed a copy with caption), which this version has. Besides, The Grinch who stole Christmas, and Charlie Browns Christmas, it's one of my favorites. I recommed this story!"
2,"Cheap, poor quality fabric","I like the pattern, but the quality of the flannel is the same as the $1.00/yard stuff at WalMart, even thinner and much lower thread count than the bargain flannel at JoAnn Fabric's. Of course if you are not used to dealing with decent quality fabrics it might be adequate for you, and the price is such that I won't return it if I have to pay shipping."
4,A duvet that keeps you warm at night,"I love my duvet cover. The price is right, and the snowflake design is super cute. It matches my light blue bedroom walls. Love it! Do u Love it!??? I Luv it!"
3,A quick look at Van Morrison,"This bio is best on the early years, including Them, and is also insightful on the Bang period, giving these interesting early works a worthy analysis. Then, the book begins a march through Van's big catalogue and there are fewer insights. Of course, Morrison wasn't interviewed, so we get quotes from magazine articles over the years. Like most authors, this one professes not to understand why Morrison is so 'difficult.' But obviously, the man probably suffers from a mild form of bipolar disorder, which affects his moods. No matter. The music is still the most important thing about Morrison, not his nasty personality."
1,avoid,"I didn't even buy this book, but I thought it was so bad that I wanted to warn others. A complete waste of time. Somehow I feel like I know LESS about the man than I did before. The only good parts are the interview quotes from magazine articles that the author had nothing to do with. His lengthy reviews, which make up most of the book, are awful. I don't know how you can make such a boring book out of such a complicated and talented guy."
3,Interesting for historical purposes,"This CD is worth buying for historical reasons-Jimi Hendrix playing backup for an early rap record (a few of his trademarks are heard, such as his making the guitar do a ""wolf whistle"").But other than that, not much to speak of. Lightnin' Rod's rap in 1960s hustler slang of the tale of a prostitute and her pimp is an ugly forerunner to the ""gangster rap"" of two and three decades later, as the pimp ""Gypsy Fair the drugstore millionaire"" is the hero of the tale for his ability to control his prostitute, Miss Fontaine. No thanks.However, there is also a moving tune called ""OD"" a sad but beautiful soliloquy to the sound of Buddy Miles' organ of the death of a heroin addict. Aside from the novelty of this being a rap record recorded in 1969 and the fact that Jimi's drummer Buddy Miles is playing the organ, this tune is really worth listening to."
4,"On topic, royally!","Nothing but articles and debates on yield management -- in the UK.Good case examples, and even articles without formulae.Worth about 40 minutes, max."
3,Pioneer stuff.....,"This book covers the basics of YM, and can be a usefull start. Certainly the topics covered stimulate a longer line of thought. It is clear though that the authors (at the time of writting)were pioneers in a field that had only just been discovered.For those not familiar with the topic, I can recommend this as an appetizer. To dive into YM you need other sources of deeper inspiration."
5,Durham Does It Again,"David Anthony Durham does it again-he creates a historical novel so deep and believable that the reader is left to ponder whether Durham is really a reincarnation of someone who lived several hundred years ago. After all, how else could he know what happened?Meticulously researched, Walk Through Darkness leads us through the journeys of several characters profoundly caught in the abyss of slavery-people so emotionally rich that we hunger at times to jump between the pages to intervene in their situations. Durham is a master of dialogue, creating words so beautiful that you go back and read, and reread them, to savor their full impact. The threads of the plot are so carefully woven together that when they converge at a dramatic crescendo, you are left with mouth ajar.Simply stated, this book is incredible. Once you pick it up, you won't put it down until the last page-and beyond."
4,Great read,I read this book because it was assignment in my boyfriend's English class. Usually I'm more of a non-fiction DIY self-help book person but this was definitely worthwhile.
